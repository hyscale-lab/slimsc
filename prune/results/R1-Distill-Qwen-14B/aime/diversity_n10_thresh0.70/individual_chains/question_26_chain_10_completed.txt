Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem says:

"Let ABC be a triangle inscribed in circle ω. Let the tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D, and let AD intersect ω at P. If AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, AP can be written as the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime integers. Find m + n."

Hmm. Alright, so I need to find AP, which is a segment from A to P, where P is the second intersection point of line AD with the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

First, let me sketch the scenario mentally. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangent lines at B and C meet at D. Then AD is drawn, intersecting ω again at P. I'm to find AP.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point to a circle, they are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, BD = CD.

Hmm. So point D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents from D to ω touch at B and C, so D is the exsimilicenter or something related to the tangents. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I can use power of a point.

Power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC², since DB and DC are both tangent lengths. So Power(D) = DB² = DC².

Also, since AD intersects ω at A and P, by the power of point D with respect to ω, we have that DA * DP = DB².

So, DA * DP = DB².

If I can find DA and DB², then maybe I can solve for DP, and then find AP = AD - DP or DP - AD, depending on the order.

Wait, the points are A, then P, then D? Or D, then P, then A? Hmm, depends on where P is. Since AD is a line from A passing through P and then D, which is outside the circle, so P is between A and D. So the order is A---P---D.

So, AP would be the length from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, in terms of segments, AD = AP + PD. Then, the power of point D gives DA * DP = DB². But DA is AD, so AD * DP = DB².

Wait, but if I let AP = x, then PD = AD - x. So, AD * (AD - x) = DB². Hmm, but I don't know AD or DB.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute AD first.

But to compute AD, perhaps I can find it in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Wait, is there a theorem related to this configuration? I think there is something called the "power of a point" and maybe properties related to the symmedian.

Wait, another approach: since BD and CD are tangents, triangle BDC is an isosceles triangle with BD = CD. Also, point D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC.

Wait, the symmedian. The tangents from D to the circle meet at B and C, so D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Hmm, so AD is the symmedian.

Wait, but in triangle ABC, the symmedian can be constructed from A as well. The symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use harmonic division or projective geometry concepts, but maybe that's getting too ahead.

Another idea: maybe use Stewart's theorem to compute AD.

But for that, I need to know some more lengths. Wait, perhaps I can compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC, then use it to find DB, and then relate AD and AP.

Wait, let's compute the circumradius R first.

Given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute its area using Heron's formula.

Compute semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Area Δ = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = √[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = √[504] = √[16 * 31.5] = 4√31.5? Wait, no, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504. So √504 = √(16 * 31.5) = 4√31.5, but that seems messy.

Wait, 504 = 16*31.5, but 31.5 is not a perfect square. Alternatively, factor 504:

504: divide by 2: 252, again by 2: 126, again by 2: 63, which is 7*9. So 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 *7^1.

So sqrt(504) = 2^(3/2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3 * sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). So area Δ = 6√14.

Wait, that makes sense because 6√14 squared is 36*14=504. So area is 6√14.

Then, the circumradius R = (a b c)/(4Δ) = (5 * 9 * 10)/(4 * 6√14).

Compute numerator: 5*9 =45, 45*10=450.

Denominator: 4*6=24; 24√14.

So R = 450/(24√14) = (450/24)/√14 = (75/4)/√14. Rationalizing the denominator: (75/4) * (√14/14) )= (75√14)/56.

So R = 75√14 /56.

Hmm, okay. So R is known.

Now, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

So to find DA and DP, we need to find DB.

But how?

Wait, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so BD = CD, and BD is equal to the length of the tangent from D to ω.

Wait, the length of the tangent from D to ω is DB = DC.

So, if I can compute DB, then I can relate it to DA and DP via power of a point.

But to find DB, maybe I can find the coordinates of D or use some properties.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry. Let me try that.

Let me place the triangle ABC in coordinate system to compute coordinates.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0) because AC=10, and point B somewhere in the plane.

Given that AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

So, coordinates:

C: (0,0)

A: (10,0)

B: (x,y), which I need to find.

Compute coordinates of B.

Given distances:

AB=5: distance from A(10,0) to B(x,y) is 5: √[(x-10)^2 + y^2]=5 → (x-10)^2 + y^2=25.

BC=9: distance from C(0,0) to B(x,y)=9: √(x^2 + y^2)=9 → x^2 + y^2=81.

So, subtract BC^2 from AB^2: (x-10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 25 -81 → x² -20x +100 + y² -x² - y² = -56 → -20x +100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x=156/20=39/5=7.8.

So x=39/5, which is 7.8.

Then, plug x into BC^2: x² + y²=81.

x=39/5, so x²= (39/5)^2=1521/25=60.84.

So 60.84 + y²=81 → y²=81 -60.84=20.16.

20.16 is 504/25, because 504 ÷25=20.16. So y=√(504/25)=√504 /5= (6√14)/5, since 504=36*14.

So y= (6√14)/5.

So coordinates of B are (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, points:

A: (10,0)

B: (39/5, 6√14/5)

C: (0,0)

Now, to find the equation of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω.

The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the circumcenter.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the equation of the tangent at B.

First, find the circumcenter O of triangle ABC.

Since I have coordinates of A, B, C, I can compute O.

The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

Wait, but AC is from (10,0) to (0,0), so the midpoint is (5,0). The perpendicular bisector is the line perpendicular to AC (which is along the x-axis) at (5,0), so it's the vertical line x=5.

Similarly, find the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Coordinates of A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5).

Midpoint of AB: ((10 + 39/5)/2, (0 + 6√14/5)/2) = ( (50/5 +39/5)/2 , (6√14/5)/2 ) = (89/5 /2, 3√14/5) = (89/10, 3√14/5).

Slope of AB: (y_B - y_A)/(x_B - x_A) = (6√14/5 -0)/(39/5 -10) = (6√14/5)/(39/5 -50/5) = (6√14/5)/(-11/5) = -6√14/11.

So the slope of AB is -6√14/11. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6√14).

So the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10).

We know that the circumcenter O lies at the intersection of x=5 and this line.

Substitute x=5 into the equation:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(5 - 89/10).

Compute 5 - 89/10: 50/10 -89/10= -39/10.

So,

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60√14) = (-143)/(20√14).

Simplify:

y = 3√14/5 + (-143)/(20√14).

Let me rationalize the denominator for the second term:

(-143)/(20√14) = (-143√14)/(20*14) = (-143√14)/280.

So,

y = (3√14/5) - (143√14)/280.

Convert 3√14/5 to denominator 280:

3√14/5 = (3√14 * 56)/280 = 168√14/280.

So,

y = (168√14 - 143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

Therefore, the circumcenter O is at (5,5√14/56).

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but okay.

Now, with O at (5, 5√14/56), we can find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, the tangent at B.

The tangent at B is perpendicular to OB.

Compute the slope of OB.

Coordinates of O: (5, 5√14/56).

Coordinates of B: (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, the vector from O to B is (39/5 -5, 6√14/5 -5√14/56).

Compute 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5=14/5.

Compute 6√14/5 -5√14/56: find common denominator, which is 280.

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280 = 336√14/280.

5√14/56 = (5√14 *5)/280 =25√14/280.

So, 336√14/280 -25√14/280=311√14/280.

So, the slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5) = (311√14/280)*(5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify: 1555 and 3920 can both be divided by 5: 1555/5=311, 3920/5=784.

So slope of OB is (311√14)/784.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311√14).

Simplify: rationalize the denominator, perhaps?

-784/(311√14) = (-784√14)/(311*14) = (-784√14)/(4354) → simplify 784 and 4354.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 392/2177.

Wait, 392 is 49*8, 2177 ÷ 7? 2177/7=311, exactly. So 392=49*8, 2177=7*311.

So, (-784√14)/(4354)= (-392√14)/(2177)= (-49*8√14)/(7*311)= (-7√14 *8 )/(311) = (-56√14)/311.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 784 divided by 14 is 56, and 3920 divided by 14 is 280.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the slope as -784/(311√14).

Wait, in any case, maybe it's better to write the equation of the tangent at B.

Point-slope form: y - y_B = m*(x - x_B), where m is the slope of the tangent.

So,

y - (6√14/5) = (-784/(311√14))(x - 39/5).

That's the equation of the tangent at B.

Similarly, the tangent at C.

Since point C is at (0,0), the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

Compute the slope of OC.

O is at (5,5√14/56), so vector from O to C is (-5, -5√14/56).

Slope is (Δy)/(Δx) = (-5√14/56)/(-5) = (√14)/56.

Therefore, the slope of OC is √14/56, so the tangent at C has slope perpendicular to that, which is -56/√14.

Simplify: -56/√14 = -56√14/14 = -4√14.

So, the tangent at C has slope -4√14.

Therefore, equation of tangent at C is y -0 = -4√14(x -0), so y = -4√14 x.

So, equations of the two tangents:

Tangent at B: y - (6√14/5) = (-784/(311√14))(x - 39/5).

Tangent at C: y = -4√14 x.

Point D is their intersection.

So, let's solve these two equations.

Substitute y = -4√14 x into the equation for tangent at B.

So,

-4√14 x - 6√14/5 = (-784/(311√14))(x - 39/5).

Multiply both sides by 311√14 to eliminate denominators:

Left side: (-4√14 x - 6√14/5)*311√14.

Right side: -784(x - 39/5).

Compute left side:

First, expand:

= (-4√14 x)*311√14 - (6√14/5)*311√14.

Compute each term:

-4√14 x * 311√14 = -4*311*(√14 *√14) x = -4*311*14 x = (-4*4354)x = (-17416)x.

Similarly, -(6√14/5)*311√14 = -(6/5)*311*(√14)^2 = -(6/5)*311*14 = -(6*311*14)/5.

Compute 6*311=1866; 1866*14 = 26124; 26124/5=5224.8.

So, left side: -17416 x -5224.8.

Right side: -784(x -39/5) = -784x + (784*39)/5.

Compute 784*39: 784*40=31360, minus 784: 31360 -784=30576.

So, right side: -784x + 30576/5 = -784x + 6115.2.

So, equation:

-17416x -5224.8 = -784x +6115.2.

Bring all terms to left:

-17416x +784x -5224.8 -6115.2 =0.

Compute:

-16632x -11340 =0.

So,

-16632x =11340 → x= -11340 /16632.

Simplify the fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 11340 ÷12=945, 16632 ÷12=1386.

Again divide by 3: 945 ÷3=315, 1386 ÷3=462.

Again divide by 3: 315 ÷3=105, 462 ÷3=154.

Again divide by 7: 105 ÷7=15, 154 ÷7=22.

So, x= -15/22.

Therefore, x= -15/22.

Then y= -4√14 x = -4√14*(-15/22) = (60√14)/22 = (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we have point A at (10,0), point D at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

We need to find the equation of line AD.

Compute the slope of AD: m = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30√14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10).

Compute denominator: -15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.

So, slope m = (30√14/11) / (-235/22) = (30√14/11) * (-22/235) = (30√14 * (-22)) / (11*235).

Simplify: 30 and 235: 30 and 235 have a common factor of 5: 30/5=6, 235/5=47.

22 and 11: 22 is 2*11, so 22/11=2.

So,

(30√14 * (-22)) / (11*235) = [6*2 * (-√14)] /47 = (-12√14)/47.

So, slope m= -12√14/47.

Equation of AD: y -0 = (-12√14/47)(x -10).

So, y = (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Now, find point P where AD intersects ω again.

We know that A is on ω, and P is the other intersection. So, we can solve for the intersection of line AD with the circumcircle ω.

Equation of ω: since it's the circumcircle of ABC, and we know the circumradius and center.

Circumcenter O is at (5,5√14/56). Radius R=75√14/56.

So, equation of ω: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Let me compute that.

But maybe substituting y from AD into the circle equation is better.

So, substitute y = (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47 into ω's equation.

So,

(x -5)^2 + [ (-12√14/47 x + 120√14/47 -5√14/56 ) ]^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

This looks complicated, but let's compute step by step.

First, compute the expression inside the second bracket:

(-12√14/47 x + 120√14/47 -5√14/56).

Factor out √14:

√14 [ (-12/47 x + 120/47 ) -5/56 ].

Compute the constants:

Compute 120/47 -5/56.

Find a common denominator, which is 47*56=2632.

120/47 = (120*56)/2632 = 6720/2632.

5/56 = (5*47)/2632=235/2632.

So,

120/47 -5/56=6720/2632 -235/2632= (6720-235)/2632=6485/2632.

So, the expression becomes:

√14 [ (-12/47 x) + 6485/2632 ].

Wait, let me check:

Wait, 120/47 is equal to 120*56/(47*56)=6720/2632.

Similarly, 5/56 is 5*47/(47*56)=235/2632.

So, 120/47 -5/56 = (6720-235)/2632=6485/2632.

Therefore, the expression inside the second bracket is:

√14 [ (-12/47 x) + 6485/2632 ].

So, we can write the entire equation as:

(x -5)^2 + [ √14 ( (-12/47 x) + 6485/2632 ) ]^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (x -5)^2.

Second term: [ √14 ( (-12/47 x) + 6485/2632 ) ]^2 = 14 [ (-12/47 x + 6485/2632 ) ]^2.

Right-hand side: (75√14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2).

So, equation becomes:

(x-5)^2 +14 [ (-12/47 x +6485/2632 ) ]^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2).

Let me compute the right-hand side first.

75^2=5625.

56^2=3136.

So, (5625 *14)/3136 = (5625/3136)*14.

Simplify 5625/3136: let's see, 5625=75^2, 3136=56^2.

So, (75^2 *14)/(56^2) = (75/56)^2 *14.

75/56 is approximately 1.339, but exact fraction is 75/56.

So, (75/56)^2 *14 = (5625/3136)*14 = (5625*14)/3136.

Compute 5625*14=78750.

So, RHS=78750/3136.

Simplify 78750 ÷14=5625, 3136 ÷14=224.

Wait, no, 78750/3136: both divisible by 2: 39375/1568.

Hmm, okay, let's keep it as 78750/3136 for now.

Now, expand the left-hand side.

First, expand (x -5)^2:

x² -10x +25.

Second term:14 [ (-12/47 x +6485/2632 ) ]^2.

Compute the square:

Let me denote a= -12/47, b=6485/2632.

So, (a x +b)^2 = a²x² + 2ab x + b².

Compute a², 2ab, b².

a= -12/47 → a²=144/2209.

2ab=2*(-12/47)*(6485/2632)= 2*(-12*6485)/(47*2632).

Compute numerator: -12*6485= -77820.

Denominator:47*2632=47*2632. Let me compute 2632*47:

2632 *40=105280,

2632*7=18424,

Sum:105280 +18424=123704.

So, 2ab= 2*(-77820)/123704= (-155640)/123704.

Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 155640 ÷8=19455, 123704 ÷8=15463.

Wait, 155640 ÷8=19455, 123704 ÷8=15463.

Wait, 15463 is a prime? Not sure, but perhaps we can see if 19455 and 15463 have common factors.

Compute GCD(19455,15463):

19455 ÷15463=1 with remainder 19455-15463=3992.

15463 ÷3992=3, remainder 15463-3*3992=15463-11976=3487.

3992 ÷3487=1, remainder 505.

3487 ÷505=6, remainder 3487-6*505=3487-3030=457.

505 ÷457=1, remainder 48.

457 ÷48=9, remainder 35.

48 ÷35=1, remainder 13.

35 ÷13=2, remainder 9.

13 ÷9=1, remainder4.

9 ÷4=2, remainder1.

4 ÷1=4, remainder0.

So GCD is 1. So, the fraction is -19455/15463.

So, 2ab= -19455/15463.

Similarly, compute b²= (6485/2632)^2.

Compute 6485^2: 6485*6485.

Wait, that's a big number. Maybe I can leave it as (6485)^2/(2632)^2 for now.

So, putting it all together:

14*(a x +b)^2=14*(a²x² +2ab x +b²)=14*(144/2209)x² +14*(-19455/15463)x +14*(6485²)/(2632²).

Wait, this is getting really messy. Maybe I should find another approach.

Wait, but since point A is on both the line AD and the circle ω, when we solve the equation, x=10 will be a solution. So, when we expand the equation, it should factor into (x-10)(something)=0. Then, the other solution will give us x-coordinate of P.

So, perhaps instead of expanding everything, I can factor it.

Let me denote the equation:

(x -5)^2 +14 [ (-12/47 x +6485/2632 ) ]^2 = 78750/3136.

Let me write this as:

(x-5)^2 +14*(expression)^2 = RHS.

But this approach might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps parametrize the line AD and find the other intersection point.

Parametrize AD: starting at A(10,0), moving towards D(-15/22,30√14/11).

Parametric equations:

x =10 + t*(-15/22 -10) =10 + t*(-235/22).

y=0 + t*(30√14/11 -0)= t*(30√14/11).

So, x=10 - (235/22)t, y= (30√14/11)t.

We need to find t such that (x,y) is on ω.

Substitute into ω's equation: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

So,

( [10 - (235/22)t -5] )^2 + ( [ (30√14/11)t -5√14/56 ] )^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Simplify:

First term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2.

Second term: [ (30√14/11)t -5√14/56 ]^2.

Compute each term.

First term:

= [5 - (235/22)t]^2 =25 - 2*5*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t².

=25 - (2350/22)t + (55225/484)t².

=25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t².

Second term:

Factor out √14:

= [√14 (30/11 t -5/56 )]^2 =14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2.

Compute inside the square:

=14*( (30/11 t -5/56 )^2 ).

=14*( ( (30*56 t -5*11 ) / (11*56) )^2 )

Wait, let me compute 30/11 t -5/56.

Find a common denominator: 11*56=616.

= (30*56 t -5*11)/616 = (1680 t -55)/616.

So,

=14*( (1680 t -55)/616 )^2.

=14*( (1680 t -55)^2 )/(616)^2.

Simplify denominators:

616=56*11=8*7*11.

So, 616^2= (8*7*11)^2=64*49*121.

So,

=14*(1680t -55)^2 / (64*49*121).

Simplify 14 and 49: 14=2*7, 49=7^2.

So,

= (2*7)*(1680t -55)^2 / (64*49*121) = (2)*(1680t -55)^2 / (64*7*121).

Wait, 49=7^2, so 64*49=64*7^2.

So,

= (2)*(1680t -55)^2 / (64*7^2*121).

I think this might not be the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe express the second term as:

[ (30√14/11 t -5√14/56 ) ]^2 = (30/11 t -5/56 )² *14.

So,

=14*( (30/11 t -5/56 )² ).

So, let me compute (30/11 t -5/56 )².

Let me compute 30/11 t -5/56:

= (30*56 t -5*11)/(11*56) = (1680 t -55)/616.

So, squared: (1680 t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

So, the second term is 14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

Now, sum the two terms:

First term:25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t².

Second term:14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

Set equal to RHS:78750/3136.

So,

25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t² +14*(1680t -55)^2/(616)^2 =78750/3136.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can compute each term numerically.

But considering that t=0 corresponds to point A, which is on both the line and the circle, so when t=0, the equation holds.

The other solution will give t≠0, which is point P.

So, perhaps we can write the equation as:

At² + Bt + C =0,

and since t=0 is a solution, C=0, but in this case, C would be 25 -0 +0 =25, which isn't zero. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps another way: Since A is on the circle and on AD, when t=0, (x,y)=(10,0) is a solution. The other intersection is P, which corresponds to t=t1.

So, the equation will have two solutions: t=0 and t=t1.

Therefore, the quadratic equation in t can be written as a*t² + b*t + c=0, with t=0 being a solution, so c=0. But in our equation, when t=0, the left side is 25 + [something] which is not zero. So that approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the value of t for which the parametric equations satisfy the circle equation.

But this is getting too involved. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps use inversion. But that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for O, perhaps compute the equation of line AD and find its other intersection with ω.

Wait, another idea: Since we're to find AP, and we know that AP * AD = (something), perhaps use the power of point A with respect to some circle?

Wait, but point A is on ω, so its power is zero. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps use similar triangles or harmonic division.

Wait, another approach: since D is the intersection of the two tangents, BD and CD are equal.

We can compute BD using the formula for the length of a tangent from a point to a circle.

The length of the tangent from D to ω is DB=DC=√(OD² - R²).

But we have coordinates for O and D.

Compute distance OD.

O is at (5,5√14/56), D is at (-15/22,30√14/11).

Compute OD²:

(5 - (-15/22))² + (5√14/56 -30√14/11)^2.

Compute each term:

First term:5 +15/22= (110 +15)/22=125/22. So, (125/22)^2=15625/484.

Second term:5√14/56 -30√14/11.

Factor out √14:

√14*(5/56 -30/11)=√14*(55 - 1680)/(56*11)=√14*(-1625)/(616).

So, (5√14/56 -30√14/11)=√14*(-1625)/616.

So, square of this term:

14*(1625)^2/(616)^2.

So, OD²=15625/484 +14*(1625)^2/(616)^2.

Then, DB²=OD² - R².

R is 75√14/56, so R²= (75^2 *14)/(56^2)= (5625*14)/(3136)=78750/3136.

So, DB²=15625/484 +14*(1625)^2/(616)^2 -78750/3136.

This seems very involved, but perhaps compute each term numerically.

Compute each term:

First term:15625/484 ≈ 32.285.

Second term:14*(1625)^2/(616)^2.

Compute 1625²=2640625.

616²=379456.

So, 14*2640625/379456 ≈14*6.952≈97.328.

Third term:78750/3136≈25.12.

So,

DB²≈32.285 +97.328 -25.12≈104.493.

But this is an approximate value. Maybe exact computation is better.

Wait, let's compute 1625=25*65=25*5*13=5^3 *13.

616=8*77=8*7*11.

So, 1625²=5^6 *13².

616²=8² *7² *11²=64*49*121.

So,

Second term:14*(5^6 *13²)/(64*49*121).

Simplify:

14 and49:14=2*7, 49=7²→ cancels to 2/7.

5^6=15625.

13²=169.

So,

= (2/7)*(15625 *169)/(64*121).

Compute numerator:15625*169.

15625*100=1,562,500.

15625*69=1,562,500*(0.69)=approx, but exact computation:

15625*169=15625*(170-1)=15625*170 -15625.

15625*170=15625*100 +15625*70=1,562,500 +1,093,750=2,656,250.

Minus 15625:2,656,250 -15,625=2,640,625.

So, numerator=2,640,625.

Denominator=64*121=7744.

So,

= (2/7)*(2,640,625 /7744)= (2/7)*(339.825)= approx 97.1.

But exact fraction: 2,640,625 /7744= (2,640,625 ÷25)/(7744 ÷25)=105,625 /309.76. Wait, not helpful.

So, 2,640,625 /7744= (2,640,625 ÷ 16)/(7744 ÷16)=165,039.0625 /484.

Wait, not helpful. Maybe leave it as is.

So, the second term is 14*(1625)^2/(616)^2= (2,640,625 *14)/(379,456)= 36,968,750 /379,456≈97.328.

So, back to computing DB²:

OD²=15625/484 +36,968,750 /379,456 -78750/3136.

Convert all to the same denominator, which is 379456.

Compute each term:

15625/484 = (15625 *784)/379456= (15625 *784)=12,250,000 /379456.

Wait, 484 *784=379,456.

So,

15625/484=15625*(784)/379456=15625*784=12,250,000. So, 12,250,000 /379,456.

Similarly, 36,968,750 /379,456 remains as is.

78750/3136=78750*(120.000)/379,456≈78750*120=9,450,000. Wait, no, 3136 is 379456 ÷120.000? Wait, 379456 ÷3136=121.

Because 3136*121=379,456.

So,

78750/3136=78750*121/379,456.

Compute 78750*121: 78750*100=7,875,000; 78750*20=1,575,000; 78750*1=78,750. Sum:7,875,000 +1,575,000=9,450,000 +78,750=9,528,750.

So, 78750/3136=9,528,750 /379,456.

So, OD²=12,250,000/379,456 +36,968,750/379,456 -9,528,750/379,456.

Sum numerators:

12,250,000 +36,968,750=49,218,750 -9,528,750=39,690,000.

So, OD²=39,690,000 /379,456.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 39,690,000 ÷8=4,961,250; 379,456 ÷8=47,432.

Again divide by 2:4,961,250 ÷2=2,480,625;47,432 ÷2=23,716.

Again divide by 13: 2,480,625 ÷13=190,817.307… Not integer. Wait, 13*190,817=2,480,621, remainder 4. So not divisible.

Hmm, perhaps 2,480,625 is divisible by 25: 2,480,625 ÷25=99,225. 23,716 ÷25=948.64, not integer.

So, OD²=2,480,625 /23,716.

Wait, 2,480,625 ÷25=99,225. 23,716 ÷25=948.64. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, 2,480,625=25*99,225=25*25*3,969=625*3,969.

3,969=63^2=9^2 *7^2.

So, 2,480,625=625*9^2*7^2= (25*3*7)^2= (525)^2.

Wait, 525^2=275,625. Wait, no, 525^2=275,625, which is not 2,480,625. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, 2,480,625 ÷625=3969.

3969=63^2.

So, 2,480,625=625*63².

Similarly, 23,716: let's see, 23,716 ÷4=5,929.

5,929 is 77^2.

So, 23,716=4*77².

So,

OD²=625*63²/(4*77²)= (625/4)*(63/77)^2.

63/77=9/11.

So,

= (625/4)*(81/121)= (625*81)/(4*121)=50,625/484.

So, OD²=50,625/484.

Therefore, DB²=OD² - R²=50,625/484 - (75√14/56)^2.

Wait, R²=(75√14/56)^2= (5625 *14)/(3136)=78,750/3136.

So,

DB²=50,625/484 -78,750/3136.

Convert to common denominator:484*3136.

Wait, 484=22²=4*121, 3136=56²=16*196=16*14².

But perhaps better to compute:

50,625/484 = (50,625 *6.48) /3136.

Wait, maybe compute numerically:

50,625/484≈104.6.

78,750/3136≈25.12.

So, DB²≈104.6 -25.12≈79.48.

But exact computation:

Compute 50,625/484 -78,750/3136.

Find common denominator: 484 and 3136.

Factor 484=4*121=4*11².

3136=16*196=16*14²=16*(2*7)^2=16*4*49=64*49.

So, LCM(484,3136)=4*11² *64*49=4*121*64*49.

But that's a big number. Instead, compute as decimals:

50,625 /484 ≈104.6.

78,750 /3136≈25.12.

So, DB²≈104.6 -25.12=79.48.

So, DB≈√79.48≈8.916.

But maybe exact fraction:

50,625/484 -78,750/3136 = (50,625*6.48 -78,750)/(3136).

Wait, 50,625*6.48=50,625*(6 +0.48)=50,625*6=303,750 +50,625*0.48=24,292.5. Total≈328,042.5.

So, 328,042.5 -78,750=249,292.5.

So, 249,292.5 /3136≈79.48.

So, DB²≈79.48.

Now, from power of point D: DA * DP = DB².

So, if I can compute DA and DP, then DA * DP=DB²≈79.48.

But DA is the distance from D to A.

Point D is at (-15/22,30√14/11), A is at (10,0).

Compute DA:

√[ (10 - (-15/22))² + (0 -30√14/11)^2 ].

Compute each term:

10 +15/22= (220 +15)/22=235/22. So, (235/22)^2=55,225/484.

Second term: (30√14/11)^2=900*14/(121)=12,600/121.

So, DA²=55,225/484 +12,600/121.

Convert to common denominator:

55,225/484 + (12,600*4)/484=55,225/484 +50,400/484=105,625/484.

So, DA=√(105,625/484)=325/22.

So, DA=325/22.

Now, from power of point D: DA * DP = DB²=79.48≈(325/22)*DP.

So, DP= DB² / DA= (79.48)/(325/22)= (79.48)*(22/325).

But since we have exact values, let's compute DB² exactly.

Earlier, we found DB²=50,625/484 -78,750/3136.

Compute exactly:

50,625/484 -78,750/3136.

Convert to a common denominator of 484*3136.

But this is cumbersome. Alternatively, compute as fractions:

50,625/484 = (50,625 *7)/ (484*7)=354,375/3388.

78,750/3136= (78,750 *11)/(3136*11)=866,250/34,496.

Wait, 3388 and 34,496: 34,496 ÷3388≈10.17, not helpful.

Alternatively, use cross multiplication.

Let me compute 50,625/484 -78,750/3136.

= (50,625 *3136 -78,750 *484)/(484*3136).

Compute numerator:

50,625 *3136:

50,625 *3000=151,875,000.

50,625 *136=50,625*(100+36)=5,062,500 +1,822,500=6,885,000.

So total=151,875,000 +6,885,000=158,760,000.

78,750 *484:

78,750 *400=31,500,000.

78,750 *84=6,617,500.

Total=31,500,000 +6,617,500=38,117,500.

So numerator=158,760,000 -38,117,500=120,642,500.

Denominator=484*3136=1,514,  let me compute 484*3136.

484 *3000=1,452,000.

484 *136=484*(100 +36)=48,400 +17,424=65,824.

Total=1,452,000 +65,824=1,517,824.

So, DB²=120,642,500 /1,517,824.

Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: numerator=30,160,625, denominator=379,456.

30,160,625 /379,456.

Check if they have common factors.

Compute GCD(30,160,625, 379,456).

But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, note that 30,160,625 ÷379,456≈79.48.

Which is consistent with earlier approximate value.

So, DB²≈79.48.

So, DA=325/22≈14.7727.

Thus, DP=DB² / DA=79.48 /14.7727≈5.38.

But wait, the exact value:

DB²=120,642,500 /1,517,824= (120,642,500 ÷4)/(1,517,824 ÷4)=30,160,625 /379,456.

And DA=325/22.

So, DP= (30,160,625 /379,456) / (325/22)= (30,160,625 /379,456)*(22/325).

Simplify:

30,160,625 ÷325=30,160,625 ÷25=1,206,425; 1,206,425 ÷13=92,801.923… Hmm, not integer. Maybe factor 325=5^2 *13.

30,160,625 ÷5=6,032,125. 6,032,125 ÷5=1,206,425. 1,206,425 ÷13=92,801.923… Not integer. So maybe the fraction can't be simplified.

Similarly, 379,456 ÷22=379,456 ÷2=189,728 ÷11=17,248. So, 379,456=22*17,248.

So, DP= (30,160,625 / (22*17,248)) * (22/325)=30,160,625/(17,248*325).

Simplify:

30,160,625 ÷325= 30,160,625 ÷25=1,206,425; 1,206,425 ÷13=92,801.923… Not integer.

Hmm, this is getting too messy. Maybe instead, note that AP=AD - DP.

But from the power of point D: DA * DP = DB².

So, DA=325/22, so DP= DB² / DA.

But we can write AP=AD - DP= (325/22) - (DB²)/(325/22)= (325/22) - (22 DB²)/325.

But I need to compute DB² exactly.

Earlier, DB²=50,625/484 -78,750/3136.

Compute exact value:

Convert both fractions to have a common denominator.

50,625/484 = (50,625 *7)/3388=354,375/3388.

78,750/3136= (78,750 *11)/34,496=866,250/34,496.

But 3388 and 34,496: 34,496 ÷3388≈10.17, which is not an integer. So, perhaps compute numerically:

50,625/484≈104.6.

78,750/3136≈25.12.

So, DB²≈104.6 -25.12=79.48.

So, DB²≈79.48.

Thus, DP=DB² / DA≈79.48 /14.7727≈5.38.

But to get an exact fraction:

Wait, DB²=50,625/484 -78,750/3136.

= (50,625*3136 -78,750*484)/(484*3136).

Compute numerator:

50,625 *3136=50,625*(3000 +136)=151,875,000 +6,885,000=158,760,000.

78,750*484=78,750*(400 +84)=31,500,000 +6,617,500=38,117,500.

So, numerator=158,760,000 -38,117,500=120,642,500.

Denominator=484 *3136=1,517,824.

So, DB²=120,642,500 /1,517,824.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: numerator=30,160,625, denominator=379,456.

So, DB²=30,160,625 /379,456.

Thus, DP= (30,160,625 /379,456) / (325/22)= (30,160,625 /379,456)*(22/325).

Simplify:

30,160,625 ÷325= let's see, 30,160,625 ÷25=1,206,425; 1,206,425 ÷13=92,801.923… Not integer. Hmm.

Wait, 325=5²*13.

30,160,625 ÷5=6,032,125; ÷5=1,206,425; ÷13=92,801.923… So, no.

Wait, 30,160,625 ÷22=1,370,937.5.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, write DP= (30,160,625 *22)/(379,456 *325).

Simplify:

30,160,625 *22=663,533,750.

379,456 *325= let me compute:

379,456 *300=113,836,800.

379,456 *25=9,486,400.

Total=113,836,800 +9,486,400=123,323,200.

So, DP=663,533,750 /123,323,200.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:331,766,875 /61,661,600.

Again divide by 5: 66,353,375 /12,332,320.

Check if they have common factors:

Compute GCD(66,353,375,12,332,320).

But this is time-consuming. Maybe approximate the fraction.

66,353,375 ÷12,332,320≈5.38.

So, DP≈5.38.

Thus, AP=AD - DP= (325/22) -5.38≈14.7727 -5.38≈9.3927.

But I need an exact value.

Wait, perhaps instead of using coordinates, use inversion or other theorems.

Wait, another approach: Use the theorem that AP = (AB * AC)/BD.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, use the harmonic mean or something.

Wait, another idea: Using the Power of a Point theorem, DA * DP = DB².

We have DA=325/22, so DP= DB² / DA.

But we need DB² in terms of DA.

Alternatively, I can use Stewart's theorem on triangle ABC with cevian AD.

Wait, but I don't know where D is in relation to ABC.

Alternatively, use coordinates to find AP.

Wait, since we have coordinates for A, D, and the equation of line AD, and we know that P is another intersection point with ω, perhaps we can find t≠0 in the parametric equation that satisfies the circle equation.

Recall that parametric equations for AD are:

x=10 - (235/22)t,

y= (30√14/11)t.

We can substitute these into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

So,

(5 - (235/22)t)^2 + ( (30√14/11)t -5√14/56 )^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Let me expand each term.

First term:

(5 - (235/22)t)^2 =25 - 2*5*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t².

=25 - (2350/22)t + (55,225/484)t².

=25 - (1175/11)t + (55,225/484)t².

Second term:

(30√14/11 t -5√14/56 )^2.

Factor out √14:

= [√14 (30/11 t -5/56)]^2 =14*(30/11 t -5/56)^2.

Compute inside the square:

=14*( (30*56 t -5*11)/(11*56) )^2.

=14*( (1680 t -55)/616 )^2.

=14*( (1680 t -55)^2 )/(616)^2.

=14*( (1680 t -55)^2 )/(379,456).

So, the second term is 14*(1680 t -55)^2 /379,456.

Putting it all together:

25 - (1175/11)t + (55,225/484)t² +14*(1680 t -55)^2 /379,456 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute RHS:

(75√14/56)^2= (5625 *14)/(3136)=78,750/3136.

So, equation is:

25 - (1175/11)t + (55,225/484)t² +14*(1680 t -55)^2 /379,456 =78,750/3136≈25.12.

Subtract 78,750/3136 from both sides:

25 -78,750/3136 - (1175/11)t + (55,225/484)t² +14*(1680 t -55)^2 /379,456=0.

Compute 25 -78,750/3136:

25=78,400/3136.

78,400 -78,750= -350.

So, 25 -78,750/3136= -350/3136= -50/448= -25/224.

So, the equation becomes:

-25/224 - (1175/11)t + (55,225/484)t² +14*(1680 t -55)^2 /379,456=0.

Multiply every term by 379,456 to eliminate denominators:

-25/224 *379,456 - (1175/11)t *379,456 + (55,225/484)t² *379,456 +14*(1680 t -55)^2=0.

Compute each term:

First term:

-25/224 *379,456= -25*(379,456/224)= -25*(1,696)= -42,400.

Second term:

- (1175/11)*379,456 t= - (1175 *34,496 )t= -40,570,800 t.

Wait, 379,456 ÷11=34,496.

So, -1175 *34,496= let me compute:

1175 *30,000=35,250,000.

1175 *4,496= compute 1175*4000=4,700,000; 1175*496=1175*(500-4)=587,500 -4,700=582,800.

So total=4,700,000 +582,800=5,282,800.

So, total second term: -35,250,000 -5,282,800= -40,532,800 t.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 1175*34,496= 1175*(30,000 +4,496)=1175*30,000=35,250,000; 1175*4,496= let me compute:

1175*4,000=4,700,000.

1175*496=1175*(500-4)=587,500 -4,700=582,800.

So, 4,700,000 +582,800=5,282,800.

So, total=35,250,000 +5,282,800=40,532,800.

So, the second term is -40,532,800 t.

Third term:

(55,225/484)*379,456 t²=55,225*(379,456/484) t².

379,456 ÷484=784.

So, 55,225 *784 t²=43,274,800 t².

Fourth term:

14*(1680 t -55)^2=14*( (1680 t)^2 -2*1680 t*55 +55² )=14*(2,822,400 t² -184,800 t +3,025 ).

=39,513,600 t² -2,587,200 t +42,350.

So, putting all together:

-42,400 -40,532,800 t +43,274,800 t² +39,513,600 t² -2,587,200 t +42,350=0.

Combine like terms:

t² terms:43,274,800 +39,513,600=82,788,400.

t terms:-40,532,800 -2,587,200= -43,120,000.

Constants:-42,400 +42,350= -50.

So, equation becomes:

82,788,400 t² -43,120,000 t -50=0.

Simplify the equation by dividing all terms by 2:

41,394,200 t² -21,560,000 t -25=0.

This is a quadratic equation in t: a t² +b t +c=0, where:

a=41,394,200,

b= -21,560,000,

c= -25.

Use quadratic formula:

t=[21,560,000 ±√(21,560,000² +4*41,394,200*25)]/(2*41,394,200).

Compute discriminant D= b² -4ac.

But since c is negative, D= b² +4ac.

Compute:

b²= (21,560,000)^2=464,  21,560,000^2= (2.156e7)^2= approx 4.647e14, but exact value is 464,833,600,000,000.

4ac=4*41,394,200*(-25)= -413,942,000.

But since c is negative, 4ac= -413,942,000.

Wait, but in the discriminant D= b² -4ac.

Since c is negative, -4ac= +ve.

So, D= b² -4ac= (21,560,000)^2 -4*(41,394,200)*(-25)= (21,560,000)^2 +4*41,394,200*25.

Compute:

4*41,394,200*25=4*25*41,394,200=100*41,394,200=4,139,420,000.

So, D=464,833,600,000,000 +4,139,420,000≈468,973,020,000,000.

But exact value is 464,833,600,000,000 +4,139,420,000=468,973,020,000,000.

So, sqrt(D)=√468,973,020,000,000.

Approximate sqrt: since 468,973,020,000,000 is 4.6897302e14.

sqrt(4.6897302e14)= approximately 6.85e7.

But exact value is messy. Perhaps factor:

But maybe note that t=0 is a solution, but the other solution is the one we need.

Alternatively, since we know DA=325/22 corresponds to t=1.

So, when t=1, x=10 -235/22= (220 -235)/22= (-15)/22, which is the x-coordinate of D.

Wait, but in our parametrization, t=1 corresponds to point D.

So, to find point P, which is the other intersection, we need t≠1.

So, the quadratic equation 41,394,200 t² -21,560,000 t -25=0.

We can factor this equation knowing that t=1 is a solution? Wait, plug t=1:41,394,200 -21,560,000 -25≈19,834,175≠0. So no, t=1 isn't a solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parametrization.

Wait, in the parametrization, t=0 is point A, and t=1 is point D.

But when I computed DA, I found DA=325/22, which is approximately 14.7727, which is longer than AD, which is confusing because t=1 corresponds to D, which is outside the circle. So, point P is between A and D, so t is between 0 and1.

But according to the equation, the solutions are t≈(21,560,000 ±√D)/(2*41,394,200).

Compute approximate t:

√D≈684,900,000 (since (684,900,000)^2=468,  684.9e6^2=468. somethinge12, but our D is ~4.689e14, so sqrt(D)=approx 684,900,000.

So,

t≈[21,560,000 ±684,900,000]/82,788,400.

Compute both roots:

First root:

(21,560,000 +684,900,000)/82,788,400≈706,460,000/82,788,400≈8.536.

Second root:

(21,560,000 -684,900,000)/82,788,400≈-663,340,000/82,788,400≈-8.02.

So, the two roots are approximately t≈8.536 and t≈-8.02.

But wait, in our parametrization, t=0 is A, t=1 is D. So, the positive root t≈8.536 is beyond D, which is outside the circle. The negative root t≈-8.02 is in the opposite direction of D from A, which would be on the other side of A.

But the other intersection point P should be between A and D, so t should be between 0 and1.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps there is a mistake in the parametrization or the earlier steps.

Wait, maybe I messed up the parametrization direction.

In the parametrization, I set x=10 - (235/22)t, y=(30√14/11)t.

But as t increases, x decreases and y increases, moving towards D.

But perhaps to get point P between A and D, t should be negative? Because when t is positive, we go beyond D.

Wait, no. If t=0 is A, and t=1 is D, then t=0.5 would be halfway between A and D. But our solutions for t are both beyond D (t>1) or in the opposite direction (t<0). This suggests that perhaps the parametrization is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have parametrized from D towards A, so that t=0 is D and t=1 is A.

Let me try that.

Parametric equations starting from D(-15/22,30√14/11) towards A(10,0).

So,

x= -15/22 + t*(10 +15/22)= -15/22 + t*(235/22).

y=30√14/11 + t*(0 -30√14/11)=30√14/11 -30√14/11 t.

So, x= -15/22 + (235/22)t,

y=30√14/11*(1 -t).

Now, substitute into the circle equation.

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute each term:

x -5= (-15/22 +235t/22 -5)= (-15/22 -110/22 +235t/22)= (-125/22 +235t/22)= (235t -125)/22.

y -5√14/56=30√14/11*(1 -t) -5√14/56.

Factor √14:

=√14*(30/11*(1 -t) -5/56 ).

Compute inside:

=√14*(30/11 -30t/11 -5/56 ).

Find common denominator for 30/11 and 5/56: 11*56=616.

30/11=1680/616,

5/56=55/616.

So,

=√14*(1680/616 -30t/11 -55/616).

=√14*( (1680 -55)/616 -30t/11 ).

=√14*(1625/616 -30t/11).

Convert 30t/11 to denominator 616: 30t/11=1800t/616.

So,

=√14*(1625 -1800t)/616.

Thus,

y -5√14/56=√14*(1625 -1800t)/616.

So, squared:

=14*(1625 -1800t)^2 / (616)^2.

Putting it all together into the circle equation:

[(235t -125)/22]^2 +14*(1625 -1800t)^2 / (616)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute each term.

First term:

(235t -125)^2 / (22)^2= (55,225t² -56, 125*470t +15,625)/484.

Wait, better to compute numerically:

(235t -125)^2=55,225t² -2*235*125 t +15,625=55,225t² -58,750t +15,625.

So, first term= (55,225t² -58,750t +15,625)/484.

Second term:

14*(1625 -1800t)^2 / (616)^2.

Compute numerator:

14*(1625 -1800t)^2=14*(2,640,625 -5,850,000t +3,240,000t²)=36,968,750 -81,900,000t +45,360,000t².

Denominator=616²=379,456.

So, second term= (36,968,750 -81,900,000t +45,360,000t²)/379,456.

Third term:

(75√14/56)^2=78,750/3136.

So, equation:

(55,225t² -58,750t +15,625)/484 + (36,968,750 -81,900,000t +45,360,000t²)/379,456 =78,750/3136.

Multiply all terms by 379,456*484 to eliminate denominators.

Compute LCM of denominators: 484=22², 379,456=616²= (8*77)^2=64*5929.

But 484=4*121, 379,456=64*5929.

So, LCM=64*5929*121=64*5929*121.

But let me compute 484 *379,456=484*379,456.

But this is getting too involved. Alternatively, multiply through by 379,456*484:

(55,225t² -58,750t +15,625)*379,456 + (36,968,750 -81,900,000t +45,360,000t²)*484 =78,750/3136 *379,456*484.

But this seems very tedious. Maybe I can instead compute the equation numerically.

Alternatively, note that when t=0, point D is on the circle? No, D is outside.

Wait, when t=1, point A is on the circle. So, equation must satisfy t=1.

So, substituting t=1 into the equation:

First term: (55,225 -58,750 +15,625)/484= (12,500)/484≈25.827.

Second term: (36,968,750 -81,900,000 +45,360,000)/379,456= (158,760,000 -81,900,000)=76,860,000 /379,456≈202.52.

So, left side≈25.827 +202.52≈228.347.

RHS=78,750/3136≈25.12.

So, 228.347≈25.12. Not equal. So, t=1 is not a solution.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to accept that this approach is too calculation-heavy and think of another way.

Wait, another idea: Use the concept of similar triangles or harmonic division.

Wait, since D is the exsimilicenter of the tangents from B and C, and AD meets the circumcircle again at P, perhaps AP * AD = AB * AC.

Wait, is that a known theorem?

Wait, yes, in some cases, the power of point A with respect to some circle, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the formula AP * AD = AB * AC might not hold, but let me check.

Wait, in this configuration, perhaps AP = (AB * AC)/BD.

But I don't know BD yet.

Wait, alternatively, using the formula from triangle geometry for the length when a cevian intersects the circumcircle.

Wait, I recall that if a cevian from A meets the circumcircle at P, then AP = (AB * AC * cos(theta)) / something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC to find angles, then apply the Law of Sines on triangle APD or something.

Compute angles of triangle ABC.

Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

Using Law of Cosines:

Compute angle at A:

cos A = (b² +c² -a²)/(2bc), where a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

So,

cos A= (10² +5² -9²)/(2*10*5)= (100 +25 -81)/100= (44)/100=0.44.

So, angle A= arccos(0.44)≈63.9 degrees.

Similarly, compute other angles.

But maybe use Law of Sines to find the circumradius.

Wait, earlier we computed R=75√14/56≈3.85.

But not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps use inversion with respect to the circumcircle.

Alternatively, perhaps use coordinates again, but another approach.

Wait, since I have coordinates for A, P lies on line AD, and on ω. So, I can parametrize line AD as before and solve for the intersection.

But as that led to a messy quadratic, perhaps another approach.

Wait, I can use parametric form with t as a parameter and solve for t where (x,y) is on ω.

But since I did that earlier and it leads to a quadratic with t≈8.536 and t≈-8.02, which don't correspond to point P between A and D.

This suggests that perhaps my earlier parametrization is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps in the parametrization, t goes beyond D when increasing, so the correct t for P is between 0 and1.

But with the quadratic giving t≈8.536 and t≈-8.02, perhaps I made an error in the parametrization.

Wait, perhaps the parametrization should have a different scaling.

Wait, in the parametrization, I set:

x=10 - (235/22)t,

y= (30√14/11)t.

But perhaps the parameter t isn't the same as the distance along AD.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different parameter, say s, such that s=0 is A, s=1 is P, s= something is D.

But I think I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps consider vectors.

Vector AD is from A(10,0) to D(-15/22,30√14/11).

So, vector AD= D -A= (-15/22 -10,30√14/11 -0)= (-235/22,30√14/11).

So, parametric form: A + s*(vector AD)= (10,0) + s*(-235/22,30√14/11).

So, point P is A + s*(vector AD), where s is such that P lies on ω.

We can write P=(10 - (235/22)s, 0 + (30√14/11)s).

We need to find s such that P lies on ω.

Substitute into ω's equation: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

So,

(5 - (235/22)s)^2 + ( (30√14/11)s -5√14/56 )^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

This is the same equation as before, leading to the quadratic in s.

Earlier, when I solved for t (which is s here), I got solutions s≈8.536 and s≈-8.02, which are outside the range [0,1].

But that can't be, since P is between A and D, so s should be between 0 and1.

Wait, perhaps the quadratic is correct, but due to approximation errors, the solutions seem outside, but exact solution is within.

Alternatively, maybe I need to solve the quadratic equation exactly.

The quadratic equation is:

82,788,400 s² -43,120,000 s -50=0.

Compute discriminant D= b² -4ac= (43,120,000)^2 +4*82,788,400*50.

Wait, since c is negative, D= b² -4ac= (43,120,000)^2 + (4*82,788,400*50).

Compute:

b²= (43,120,000)^2=1,858,  43.12e6^2= approx 1.858e15.

4ac=4*82,788,400*(-50)= -165,576,800,000.

But since c is negative, -4ac= +165,576,800,000.

So, D=1.858e15 +1.655768e11≈1.859655768e15.

sqrt(D)= approx 43,111,000.

So,

s=(43,120,000 ±43,111,000)/(2*82,788,400).

Compute two roots:

First root:

(43,120,000 +43,111,000)/165,576,800≈86,231,000/165,576,800≈0.52.

Second root:

(43,120,000 -43,111,000)/165,576,800≈9,000/165,576,800≈0.0000543.

So, the solutions are approximately s≈0.52 and s≈0.0000543.

Since s=0 is point A, s≈0.00005 is very close to A, which can't be P.

The other solution s≈0.52 is between 0 and1, so that must be point P.

So, s≈0.52.

Therefore, AP is the distance from A to P, which is s times the length of AD.

Since AD=325/22≈14.7727,

AP≈0.52 *14.7727≈7.682.

But we need the exact value.

Wait, but from the quadratic equation, the positive root is s=(43,120,000 + sqrt(D))/(2*82,788,400).

But sqrt(D)=sqrt(43,120,000² +4*82,788,400*50).

Wait, compute sqrt(D)=sqrt(1,858,  43,120,000²=1,858,  let me compute 43,120,000²:

43,120,000²= (4.312e7)^2= 185,814,400,000,000.

4ac=4*82,788,400*(-50)= -1,655,768,000,000.

But since c is negative, D= b² -4ac=1,858,  1.858e14 +1.655768e12.

Wait, 1.858e14 is 185,800,000,000,000.

1.655768e12 is 1,655,768,000,000.

So, D=185,800,000,000,000 +1,655,768,000,000=187,455,768,000,000.

So, sqrt(D)=sqrt(187,455,768,000,000)=approx 432,  432e9^2=1.866e19. Wait, no.

Wait, 43,200,000²=1,866,240,000,000,000.

Which is larger than D=187,455,768,000,000.

Wait, 43,200,000²=1.86624e15, which is larger than D=1.87455768e14.

Wait, no, 187,455,768,000,000=1.87455768e14.

So, sqrt(1.87455768e14)= approx 432,  432e6.

Compute 432,000,000²=186,624,000,000,000.

Which is less than D=187,455,768,000,000.

Compute 433,000,000²=187,489,000,000,000.

Which is larger than D.

So, sqrt(D) is between 432,000,000 and433,000,000.

Compute 432,500,000²= (432.5e6)^2= (432.5)^2 *1e12=187.056 *1e12=187,056,000,000,000.

Which is less than D=187,455,768,000,000.

Compute 432,750,000²= (432.75e6)^2= approx?

Compute (432.75)^2= (432 +0.75)^2=432² +2*432*0.75 +0.75²=186,624 +648 +0.5625=187,272.5625.

So, (432.75e6)^2=187,272.5625e12=187,272,562,500,000.

Which is greater than D=187,455,768,000,000.

Wait, no, 187,272.5625e12=187,272,562,500,000, which is less than D=187,455,768,000,000.

Wait, maybe 432,800,000²= (432.8e6)^2= approx?

432.8²=432² +2*432*0.8 +0.8²=186,624 +691.2 +0.64=187,315.84.

So, 432.8e6 squared=187,315.84e12=187,315,840,000,000.

Still less than D=187,455,768,000,000.

Next, 432,900,000²= (432.9e6)^2=432.9²= (433 -0.1)^2=433² -2*433*0.1 +0.1²=187,489 -86.6 +0.01=187,402.41.

So, 432.9e6 squared=187,402.41e12=187,402,410,000,000.

Still less than D=187,455,768,000,000.

Next, 432,950,000²= ?

432.95²= approx (433 -0.05)^2=433² -2*433*0.05 +0.05²=187,489 -43.3 +0.0025=187,445.7025.

So, 432.95e6 squared=187,445.7025e12=187,445,702,500,000.

Still less than D=187,455,768,000,000.

Next, 432,960,000²=432.96²= approx?

432.96²= (433 -0.04)^2=433² -2*433*0.04 +0.04²=187,489 -34.64 +0.0016≈187,454.3616.

So, 432.96e6 squared=187,454.3616e12=187,454,361,600,000.

Which is very close to D=187,455,768,000,000.

Compute the difference:187,455,768,000,000 -187,454,361,600,000=1,406,400,000.

So, need to go a bit higher.

Compute 432.96e6 + x.

The derivative of x² is 2x, so approximate x needed:

Let x=432,960,000 + dx.

Then, (432,960,000 + dx)^2≈432,960,000² +2*432,960,000*dx.

Set this equal to D=187,455,768,000,000.

432,960,000²=187,454,361,600,000.

So, 2*432,960,000*dx=1,406,400,000.

So, dx=1,406,400,000/(2*432,960,000)=1,406,400,000 /865,920,000≈1.624.

So, sqrt(D)≈432,960,000 +1.624≈432,961,624.

So, sqrt(D)≈432,961,624.

Therefore,

s=(43,120,000 +432,961,624)/(2*82,788,400)= (476,081,624)/(165,576,800)≈2.874.

Wait, that can't be because 43,120,000 +432,961,624=476,081,624.

Divide by 165,576,800≈2.874.

Wait, but that would make s≈2.874, which is greater than1, which contradicts earlier approximation.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, earlier when I approximated sqrt(D)=432,961,624, but that's when s=(43,120,000 + sqrt(D))/165,576,800.

Wait, 43,120,000 +432,961,624=476,081,624.

Divided by165,576,800= approx 2.874.

But earlier when I approximated sqrt(D)=432,961,624, but s=(43,120,000 +432,961,624)/165,576,800≈2.874.

But this would place P beyond D, which can't be.

Alternatively, maybe I have a sign error in the quadratic formula.

Wait, the quadratic equation was:

82,788,400 s² -43,120,000 s -50=0.

So, a=82,788,400,

b= -43,120,000,

c= -Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in a triangle inscribed in a circle. The triangle is ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at point P. I need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. There's triangle ABC with the given side lengths. The circle ω is the circumcircle, so all three points lie on it. The tangents at B and C would each touch the circle only at points B and C respectively, and they meet at some external point D. Then, drawing a line from A through D, it intersects the circle again at P. So AP is part of that line segment.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from an external point to a circle, they are equal in length. So, the lengths DB and DC should be equal because both are tangents from D to ω. That might come in handy later.

I think using power of a point could be useful here. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² or DC² since DB and DC are tangents. Also, since AD passes through P, which is on the circle, the power of D can also be expressed as DP * DA.

Wait, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA. So, if I can find DP and DA, I can find AP as DA - DP or something like that.

But first, maybe I should find the circumradius of triangle ABC. If I can find that, I can find the radius of ω, which might help in computing the lengths.

To find the circumradius R, I can use the formula:

R = (a * b * c) / (4 * Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and Δ is the area.

Given the sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, let's compute the area using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, no, 504 is 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16*31.5 is 504? Let me check: 16*30=480, plus 16*1.5=24, so 480+24=504. Hmm, but 504 factors into 16*31.5, but 31.5 isn't a perfect square. Maybe I should factor 504 differently.

Let me factor 504: 504 ÷ 2 = 252, ÷2=126, ÷2=63, ÷3=21, ÷3=7. So, 504 = 2³ * 3² * 7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2³ * 3² * 7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Oh, that's better. So Δ = 6*sqrt(14).

So R = (5*9*10)/(4*6*sqrt(14)) = (450)/(24*sqrt(14)) = (75)/(4*sqrt(14)). Wait, let me compute that again:

Wait, a=5, b=9, c=10. So a*b*c=5*9*10=450. Then, 4Δ=4*6*sqrt(14)=24*sqrt(14). So R=(450)/(24*sqrt(14)) = (450)/(24√14).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 450 ÷ 6 = 75, 24 ÷6=4. So R=75/(4√14). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

R = (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

So the circumradius R is 75√14 /56. Hmm, not sure if I need that yet.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Maybe using coordinates or inversion. But inversion might be too complicated for now.

Alternatively, maybe using harmonic division or properties of poles and polars. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, the polar of D is the line BC.

Wait, more precisely, the polar of D with respect to ω is the line BC. So maybe that can be used for some properties.

Alternatively, perhaps use similar triangles or Menelaus' theorem. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: use power of point A with respect to ω. But A is on ω, so its power is zero. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider triangle ABC and the point D, then use some trigonometric relations.

Wait, let me think about the point D. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle. Wait, no, it's the external homothety center? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, the tangents from D touch ω at B and C, so D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Or maybe on the A-symmedian? Hmm.

Alternatively, let's consider triangle ABC with circumcircle ω. The point D is the external point from which two tangents DB and DC are drawn. Then, AD is a secant that intersects ω again at P.

So, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

So, DB² = DP * DA. Therefore, DP = DB² / DA.

So, if I can find DA and DB, I can find DP, and then AP = AD - DP.

Wait, but how do I find DA? Because DA is the distance from A to D. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps express DA in terms of other lengths. Wait, maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let me try to set up a coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0), and point A on the x-axis at (10, 0), since AC=10. Then point B can be determined using the distances AB=5 and BC=9.

So, coordinates: C (0,0); A (10,0); B is somewhere in the plane.

We need to find the coordinates of point B such that AB=5 and BC=9.

So, coordinates of B satisfy:

Distance from A (10,0) to B (x,y) is 5: sqrt[(x-10)^2 + y^2] =5 → (x-10)^2 + y^2=25.

Distance from C (0,0) to B (x,y) is 9: sqrt[x^2 + y^2] =9 → x² + y²=81.

So subtract the first equation from the second:

x² + y² - [(x-10)^2 + y^2] =81 -25 → x² + y² - (x² - 20x +100 + y²) =56 → 20x -100 =56 → 20x=156 → x=156/20 = 39/5 =7.8.

So x=7.8, which is 39/5.

Then plug back into x² + y² =81:

(39/5)^2 + y²=81.

Compute (39/5)^2: 39^2=1521; 5^2=25 → 1521/25 + y²=81.

So y²=81 -1521/25 = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = (504)/25 → y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5? Wait no, as before, 504= 16*31.5? Wait, no. Wait, 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5=504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) =4*sqrt(31.5). Hmm, but 31.5=63/2, which is not a perfect square. Alternatively, 504= 7*72=7*9*8=7*9*8. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(9*56)=3*sqrt(56)=3*sqrt(4*14)=3*2*sqrt(14)=6*sqrt(14). So y=6√14 /5.

So point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So coordinates of A (10,0), B (39/5, 6√14/5), C (0,0).

Now, the tangents at B and C to ω meet at D. We need to find point D.

To find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, the tangent at C: since C is at (0,0), and the circle passes through A, B, C. The equation of the tangent at C can be found using the fact that it's perpendicular to the radius at C. The center of the circle is the circumradius center, which we can find.

Alternatively, I can compute the equation of the tangent at a point on a circle. If the circle has center (h,k) and radius R, the tangent at point (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R². Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle. The tangent line equation is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R²? Wait no, that's incorrect. Let me recall the correct equation.

The equation of the tangent to the circle at point (x1, y1) is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R². Wait, no, that's not correct because if (x1, y1) is on the circle, then (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2 = R². So the tangent line would be (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R². But actually, it's (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = 0. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the equation of the tangent at (x1, y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2. But since (x1, y1) is on the circle, (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2 = R². So the tangent equation is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Alternatively, another formula: the tangent at (x1, y1) is (x1)(x) + (y1)(y) = R², but only if the circle is centered at the origin. So in this case, since the circle is not centered at the origin, we need the general equation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the equation of the tangent line at B and C.

First, let me find the circumcircle center.

The circumcircle center is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

Wait, points A (10,0), B (39/5, 6√14/5), and C (0,0).

Let me find the perpendicular bisector of AC first. Since AC is from (10,0) to (0,0), it's along the x-axis. The midpoint is at (5,0). The perpendicular bisector is the line perpendicular to AC (which is horizontal) at (5,0), so it's the vertical line x=5.

Now, find the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Midpoint of AB: A is (10,0), B is (39/5, 6√14/5). So midpoint is [(10 + 39/5)/2, (0 + 6√14/5)/2].

Compute 10 as 50/5, so 50/5 +39/5=89/5. Divide by 2: 89/10.

Similarly, y-coordinate: (6√14/5)/2=3√14/5.

So midpoint is (89/10, 3√14/5).

Now, the slope of AB is (6√14/5 - 0)/(39/5 -10) = (6√14/5)/(39/5 -50/5) = (6√14/5)/(-11/5) = -6√14/11.

Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6√14).

So the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is:

(y - 3√14/5) = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10).

Now, since the center lies on x=5, let's substitute x=5 into this equation to find y-coordinate.

So,

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(5 - 89/10).

Compute 5 - 89/10: 50/10 -89/10= (-39)/10.

So,

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60√14) = (-143)/(20√14).

So,

y = 3√14/5 - 143/(20√14).

To combine the terms, let's rationalize the second term:

143/(20√14) = (143√14)/(20*14) = (143√14)/280.

Similarly, 3√14/5 = (3√14 *56)/280 = (168√14)/280.

So,

y = (168√14)/280 - (143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

So the center is at (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, that seems a bit small, but let's keep going.

So the circumradius center O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Now, let's compute the equation of the tangent at point B (39/5, 6√14/5).

The tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. The slope of OB is (6√14/5 - 5√14/56)/(39/5 -5).

Compute numerator: 6√14/5 -5√14/56 = (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5)/(5*56) = [336√14 -25√14]/280 = (311√14)/280.

Denominator: 39/5 -5 =39/5 -25/5=14/5.

So slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5) = (311√14/280)*(5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 1555 and 3920. Let's see if they have a common factor. 1555 ÷5=311, 3920 ÷5=784. So, 311√14/784.

But that's the slope of OB. Therefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this, so its slope is the negative reciprocal, which is -784/(311√14).

But that looks messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, using the formula for the tangent line at point (x1, y1) on the circle with center (h,k):

The equation is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle. The tangent line at (x1,y1) is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle itself. The tangent line should be:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R², but if (x1,y1) is on the circle, then (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2=R², so the tangent line is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Wait, that's correct.

So, for point B (39/5,6√14/5), the tangent line would be:

(39/5 -5)(x -5) + (6√14/5 -5√14/56)(y -5√14/56) = R².

Wait, R is the circumradius, which we can compute as the distance from O to A, since A is on the circle.

Compute OA: from O (5,5√14/56) to A (10,0).

Distance OA: sqrt[(10-5)^2 + (0 -5√14/56)^2] = sqrt[25 + (25*14)/(56²)].

Wait, 25 is 25, and (25*14)/(56²) = (350)/(3136) = 25/224.

Wait, wait: (5√14/56)²=25*14/(56²)=350/(3136)=25/224.

So OA²=25 +25/224= (25*224 +25)/224=25*(224 +1)/224=25*225/224= (625*9)/224=5625/224.

So OA= sqrt(5625/224)=75/sqrt(224)=75/(√(16*14))=75/(4√14)=75√14/56.

Which matches the earlier calculation of R=75√14/56.

So R²=(75² *14)/(56²)= (5625 *14)/(3136)=78750/3136.

Simplify 78750 ÷ 14=5625, 3136 ÷14= 224. So R²=5625/224.

So the equation of the tangent at B is:

(39/5 -5)(x -5) + (6√14/5 -5√14/56)(y -5√14/56)=5625/224.

Compute 39/5 -5: 39/5 -25/5=14/5.

Compute 6√14/5 -5√14/56: factor √14:

√14 (6/5 -5/56) = √14*( (6*56 -5*5)/280 )=√14*(336 -25)/280=√14*(311)/280.

So the equation becomes:

(14/5)(x -5) + (311√14/280)(y -5√14/56)=5625/224.

That's the equation of the tangent at B.

Similarly, the tangent at C (0,0):

Using the same formula, the equation is:

(0 -5)(x -5) + (0 -5√14/56)(y -5√14/56)=5625/224.

Wait, let's compute that.

(x1,y1)=(0,0), so:

(0 -5)(x -5) + (0 -5√14/56)(y -5√14/56)=5625/224.

Simplify:

(-5)(x -5) + (-5√14/56)(y -5√14/56)=5625/224.

So,

-5x +25 -5√14 y/56 + (5√14 *5√14)/(56*56) =5625/224.

Compute (5√14 *5√14)/(56²)= (25*14)/(3136)= 350/3136=25/224.

So the equation becomes:

-5x +25 - (5√14 y)/56 +25/224=5625/224.

Bring all terms to one side:

-5x - (5√14 y)/56 +25 +25/224 -5625/224=0.

Compute constants: 25 =5600/224, so 5600/224 +25/224=5625/224. Then subtract 5625/224: 5625/224 -5625/224=0.

So,

-5x - (5√14 y)/56 +0=0 → -5x - (5√14 y)/56=0 → Multiply both sides by 56:

-280x -5√14 y=0 → 280x +5√14 y=0.

Wait, that seems a bit off because the tangent at C passes through D, which is the intersection point of the two tangents.

Wait, but I thought the tangent at C is a line passing through C (0,0) and D. So perhaps we can find another way to write the tangent equation.

Alternatively, maybe using the point-form for the tangent. Since the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.

The radius OC is from center O (5,5√14/56) to C (0,0), so vector OC is (-5, -5√14/56). Therefore, the tangent line at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of OC.

Slope of OC is (-5√14/56)/(-5)= (√14)/56.

So the slope of the tangent at C is -56/√14 = -56/(√14) = -56√14/14 = -4√14.

So the tangent line at C has equation y = (-4√14)x + 0, since it passes through (0,0).

Similarly, the tangent at B, which we computed earlier, has a slope, but let's see if we can compute it more simply.

Alternatively, since the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, which we found had a slope of 311√14/280 divided by (39/5 -5)=14/5. Wait, no, earlier, we found the slope of OB was (311√14/280)/(14/5)= 311√14/(280) *5/14 = (311√14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555√14)/(3920)=311√14/784.

Wait, so the slope of OB is 311√14/784, so the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311√14).

Simplify: -784/(311√14) can be rationalized as -784√14/(311*14) = -56√14/311.

So the tangent at B has slope -56√14/311.

So now, the tangent at B passes through point B (39/5, 6√14/5). So the equation is:

y -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

So, now we have two tangent lines: one at C is y = (-4√14)x, and the other at B is y = (-56√14/311)x + c.

To find point D, which is their intersection, we can set the two equations equal.

So:

(-4√14)x = (-56√14/311)x + c.

Wait, but we need to find c for the tangent at B.

Wait, the equation for tangent at B is:

y = (-56√14/311)x + c.

We can find c by plugging in point B (39/5,6√14/5):

6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(39/5) + c.

Compute (-56√14/311)(39/5):

= (-56*39 √14)/(311*5) = (-2184√14)/1555.

So,

c =6√14/5 +2184√14/1555.

Convert 6√14/5 to 1866√14/1555 (since 6*311=1866, 5*311=1555).

So,

c=1866√14/1555 +2184√14/1555= (1866+2184)√14/1555=4050√14/1555.

Simplify 4050/1555: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 810/311.

So c=810√14/311.

Therefore, equation of tangent at B is y = (-56√14/311)x +810√14/311.

Now, set this equal to tangent at C: y= -4√14 x.

So:

-4√14 x = (-56√14/311)x +810√14/311.

Let me divide both sides by √14 to simplify:

-4x = (-56/311)x +810/311.

Bring all terms to left side:

-4x + (56/311)x -810/311=0.

Compute coefficients:

-4x = -1244x/311.

So,

(-1244x +56x)/311 -810/311=0 → (-1188x -810)/311=0.

So,

-1188x -810 =0 → -1188x=810 → x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.

Simplify numerator and denominator: divide numerator and denominator by 9: 90/132. Again by 6: 15/22. So x= -15/22.

So x= -15/22.

Now, plug into y= -4√14 x:

y= -4√14*(-15/22)=60√14/22=30√14/11.

So point D is at (-15/22,30√14/11).

Now, we have point A at (10,0), point D at (-15/22,30√14/11). We need to find the equation of line AD and then find its intersection P with the circumcircle ω, other than A.

First, find the parametric equation of AD.

Let me compute the vector from A to D: D - A = (-15/22 -10, 30√14/11 -0)= (-15/22 -220/22,30√14/11)= (-235/22,30√14/11).

So parametric equations:

x=10 + (-235/22)t

y=0 + (30√14/11)t

where t=0 at A, t=1 at D.

We need to find where this line intersects the circle ω again at point P. So the parametric equations must satisfy the circle equation.

The circle ω has center O at (5,5√14/56) and radius R=75√14/56.

So the equation of ω is:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Substitute x=10 - (235/22) t and y= (30√14/11) t into this equation.

Let me compute each term.

First, compute x-5: [10 -235t/22] -5 =5 -235t/22.

So (x-5)^2= [5 -235t/22]^2=25 - 2*5*(235t/22) + (235t/22)^2=25 - (2350t/22) + (55225t²)/(484).

Simplify: 25 - (1175t/11) + (55225t²)/(484).

Next, y -5√14/56: (30√14 t/11) -5√14/56.

Factor out √14:

√14 [30t/11 -5/56].

Compute 30t/11 -5/56: common denominator is 616.

30t/11= (30*56 t)/616=1680t/616.

5/56=55/616.

So,

√14 [1680t/616 -55/616]=√14*(1680t -55)/616.

So (y -5√14/56)^2=14*(1680t -55)^2/(616)^2.

Compute denominator:616²= (616)^2= let's compute that:

616= 600+16, so (600+16)^2=600² +2*600*16 +16²=360000 +19200 +256=360000+19200=379200+256=379456.

So denominator is 379456.

Numerator:14*(1680t -55)^2.

So overall:

(y -5√14/56)^2=14*(1680t -55)^2 /379456.

Now, putting it all together, the equation of the circle is:

(x-5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

So,

[25 - (1175t/11) + (55225t²)/(484)] + [14*(1680t -55)^2 /379456] = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute the right-hand side:

(75√14/56)^2= (5625 *14)/(3136)=78750/3136.

So the equation becomes:

25 - (1175t/11) + (55225t²)/(484) + [14*(1680t -55)^2]/379456 =78750/3136.

This looks complicated. Maybe I can multiply through by 379456 to eliminate denominators.

Let me compute the least common multiple (LCM) of denominators:

Denominators are 1, 11, 484, 379456.

Factor each:

484=22²= (2*11)²=4*121.

379456: Let's see, 379456 ÷ 484= 379456 /484= 787. So 379456=484*787=4*121*787.

So LCM is 4*121*787= 484*787= 379456.

So multiply both sides by 379456:

379456*25 -379456*(1175t/11) +379456*(55225t²)/(484) +14*(1680t -55)^2=379456*(78750/3136).

Compute each term:

First term: 379456*25=9,486,400.

Second term: 379456*(1175t/11)= (379456/11)*1175t.

379456 ÷11=34,496 because 11*34,496=379,456. So 34,496*1175t.

Compute 34,496*1175:

Let me compute 34,496 *1000=34,496,000

34,496 *175= ?

Compute 34,496 *100=3,449,600

34,496*75= Compute 34,496*70=2,414,720; 34,496*5=172,480 → total 2,414,720 +172,480=2,587,200.

So 34,496*175=3,449,600 +2,587,200=6,036,800.

So total 34,496*1175=34,496,000 +6,036,800=40,532,800.

So second term is -40,532,800 t.

Third term:379456*(55225t²)/(484)= (379456/484)*55225t².

379456 ÷484=787 (since 484*787=379,456). So 787*55,225t²=787*55,225.

Compute 787*55,225:

Let me compute 700*55,225=38,657,500.

80*55,225=4,418,000.

7*55,225=386,575.

Total:38,657,500 +4,418,000=43,075,500 +386,575=43,462,075.

So third term is 43,462,075 t².

Fourth term:14*(1680t -55)^2.

Expand (1680t -55)^2= (1680t)^2 -2*1680t*55 +55²=2,822,400 t² -184,800 t +3,025.

Multiply by14: 39,513,600 t² -2,587,200 t +42,350.

Fifth term:379456*(78750/3136).

Compute 379456 ÷3136= 121 (because 3136*121=379,456). So 121*78,750=9,514,  121*78,750. Let me compute 100*78,750=7,875,000; 20*78,750=1,575,000; 1*78,750=78,750. So total 7,875,000 +1,575,000=9,450,000 +78,750=9,528,750.

So the equation becomes:

9,486,400 -40,532,800 t +43,462,075 t² +39,513,600 t² -2,587,200 t +42,350 =9,528,750.

Combine like terms:

t²:43,462,075 +39,513,600=82,975,675 t².

t terms: -40,532,800 t -2,587,200 t= -43,120,000 t.

Constants:9,486,400 +42,350=9,528,750.

So,

82,975,675 t² -43,120,000 t +9,528,750=9,528,750.

Subtract 9,528,750 from both sides:

82,975,675 t² -43,120,000 t =0.

Factor t:

t*(82,975,675 t -43,120,000)=0.

So solutions t=0 and t=43,120,000 /82,975,675.

Simplify the fraction:

43,120,000 /82,975,675.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 1,724,800 /3,319,027.

Wait, does 1,724,800 and 3,319,027 have any common factors?

Let me see: 3,319,027 ÷ 1,724,800 is approximately 1.923.

Compute GCD(1724800,3319027).

Use Euclidean algorithm:

3319027 ÷1724800=1 quotient, remainder 3319027 -1724800=1,594,227.

Now, GCD(1724800,1594227).

1724800 ÷1594227=1 quotient, remainder 130,573.

GCD(1594227,130573).

1594227 ÷130573=12*130573=1,566,876. 1,594,227 -1,566,876=27,351.

GCD(130573,27351).

130573 ÷27351=4*27351=109,404. Remainder 130,573 -109,404=21,169.

GCD(27351,21169).

27351 ÷21169=1 quotient, remainder 6,182.

GCD(21169,6182).

21169 ÷6182=3*6182=18,546. Remainder 21169-18546=2,623.

GCD(6182,2623).

6182 ÷2623=2*2623=5,246. Remainder 6182-5246=936.

GCD(2623,936).

2623 ÷936=2*936=1872. Remainder 2623-1872=751.

GCD(936,751).

936 ÷751=1 quotient, remainder 185.

GCD(751,185).

751 ÷185=4*185=740. Remainder 11.

GCD(185,11).

185 ÷11=16*11=176. Remainder 9.

GCD(11,9).

11 ÷9=1, remainder 2.

GCD(9,2).

9 ÷2=4, remainder 1.

GCD(2,1)=1.

So GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction cannot be simplified further.

So t=0 (which is point A) and t=43,120,000/82,975,675= 43,120,000 /82,975,675= approx 0.519.

But we need the other intersection point, so t=43,120,000 /82,975,675.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 1,724,800 /3,319,027.

Hmm, but perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, 82,975,675 =82,975,675.

Wait, 43,120,000=43,120,000=4312 *10^4.

Wait, maybe 43,120,000 ÷4312=10,000.

Wait, 4312 *10,000=43,120,000. Similarly, 82,975,675 ÷4312= let's see 4312*19,260=?

Wait, maybe it's easier to see if 43,120,000 and 82,975,675 have a common factor.

Wait, 43,120,000=43,120,000= 4312 * 10,000= (8 * 539) * 10,000=8*539*10^4.

Similarly, 82,975,675=82,975,675.

Hmm, perhaps 539 divides into 82,975,675?

Let me check: 82,975,675 ÷539.

539*153,000=539*150,000=80,850,000; 539*3,000=1,617,000 → total 80,850,000 +1,617,000=82,467,000.

Subtract from 82,975,675: 82,975,675 -82,467,000=508,675.

Now, 539*944= let's see, 539*900=485,100, 539*44=23,716 → total 485,100+23,716=508,816. That's more than 508,675. So not exact.

So probably no common factors beyond 25.

Wait, but I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Because earlier when I computed t, I think I messed up the equation.

Wait, let's go back. The equation after substitution was:

82,975,675 t² -43,120,000 t =0.

So t(82,975,675 t -43,120,000)=0.

So t=0 or t=43,120,000/82,975,675=43120000/82975675.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 1724800 /3,319,027.

Wait, 43120000 ÷25=1,724,800.

82975675 ÷25=3,319,027.

Yes. So t=1,724,800 /3,319,027.

We can check if this simplifies.

But since the GCD is 1, as we found earlier, it can't be reduced.

So t=1,724,800 /3,319,027.

Now, we can compute AP as the distance from A to P, which is along AD.

But since we have parametric equations, the length AP can be found by the distance from A to P, which is |t| times the length of AD.

Wait, but in parametric terms, t=0 is A, t=1 is D. So P is at t= t0= 1,724,800 /3,319,027 ≈ 0.519.

So vector AD is from A to D: displacement is (-235/22,30√14/11). So the length of AD is sqrt[ ( -235/22 )² + (30√14/11 )² ].

Compute each component squared:

(-235/22)^2= (235)^2/(22)^2=55225/484.

(30√14/11)^2=900*14 /121=12,600 /121.

So AD²=55225/484 +12600/121.

Convert to common denominator 484:

12,600/121= (12,600 *4)/484=50,400/484.

So AD²=55,225/484 +50,400/484=105,625/484.

So AD= sqrt(105625/484)= 325/22.

So AD=325/22.

Then, AP is the distance from A to P, which is t0 * AD.

t0=1,724,800 /3,319,027.

So AP= (1,724,800 /3,319,027 )*(325/22)= (1,724,800 *325)/(3,319,027 *22).

But this seems messy. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps using power of a point. Since D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant line intersecting the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = DB².

So DA * DP = DB².

We can compute DB, which is the length of the tangent from D to ω.

But earlier, we found that DB²=DP * DA.

So if we can find DA and DB, we can compute DP, and then AP=AD - DP.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, compute DA and DB.

We can compute DA from coordinates: A is at (10,0), D is at (-15/22,30√14/11).

Compute DA: sqrt[ (10 +15/22)^2 + (0 -30√14/11)^2 ].

Compute 10 +15/22= 220/22 +15/22=235/22.

So DA= sqrt[ (235/22)^2 + (30√14 /11)^2 ].

Which is same as what I computed earlier, which is sqrt[55,225/484 +12,600/121 ]= sqrt[105,625/484]= 325/22.

So DA=325/22.

Now, compute DB: the distance from D to B.

Point D (-15/22,30√14/11), point B (39/5,6√14/5).

Compute DB squared:

(39/5 +15/22)^2 + (6√14/5 -30√14/11)^2.

Compute first term:

39/5 +15/22= (39*22 +15*5)/(5*22)= (858 +75)/110=933/110.

Second term:

6√14/5 -30√14/11= √14*(6/5 -30/11)= √14*(66 -150)/55=√14*(-84/55)= -84√14/55.

So DB squared= (933/110)^2 + (-84√14/55)^2.

Compute each:

(933/110)^2= (933)^2/(110)^2=870,489/12,100.

(-84√14/55)^2= (84)^2*14/(55)^2=7056*14/(3025)=98,784/3025.

Convert to common denominator: 12,100.

98,784/3025= (98,784*4)/12,100=395,136/12,100.

So DB²=870,489/12,100 +395,136/12,100=1,265,625/12,100.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

1,265,625 ÷25=50,625; 12,100 ÷25=484.

So DB²=50,625/484.

Thus, DB=225/22.

So DB=225/22.

Now, from power of a point D: DB²=DP * DA.

So (225/22)^2=DP * (325/22).

So DP= (225/22)^2 / (325/22)= (225^2)/(22^2) * (22/325)= (225^2)/(22*325).

Simplify 225^2=50,625; 22*325=7,150.

So DP=50,625 /7,150.

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 25: 2,025 /286.

So DP=2025/286.

AP=AD - DP=325/22 -2025/286.

Convert to common denominator 286:

325/22= (325*13)/(22*13)=4,225/286.

So AP=4,225/286 -2,025/286=2,200/286.

Simplify 2,200 ÷2=1,100; 286 ÷2=143.

So AP=1,100/143.

Simplify 1,100 ÷11=100; 143 ÷11=13.

So AP=100/13.

So m=100, n=13. They are coprime. So m +n=113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that point \( D \) is the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle \( \omega \) at \( B \) and \( C \). By the power of a point theorem, the power of point \( D \) with respect to \( \omega \) is equal to \( DB^2 = DC^2 = DP \cdot DA \).

First, we calculate the circumradius \( R \) of triangle \( ABC \) using the formula:
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4\Delta}
\]
where \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \), \( c = 10 \), and \( \Delta \) is the area of the triangle. Using Heron's formula, we find:
\[
\Delta = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]
Thus,
\[
R = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]

Next, we determine the coordinates of points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). Placing \( C \) at the origin \((0,0)\) and \( A \) at \((10,0)\), we find \( B \) using the given distances. Solving the system of equations for the distances \( AB = 5 \) and \( BC = 9 \), we find \( B \) at \( \left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right) \).

We then find the coordinates of the circumcenter \( O \) by solving the perpendicular bisectors of \( AB \) and \( AC \), resulting in \( O \) at \( \left(5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56}\right) \).

Using the coordinates of \( B \) and \( C \), we determine the equations of the tangents at \( B \) and \( C \). Solving these equations, we find the coordinates of \( D \) at \( \left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right) \).

We then compute the length of \( AD \) using the distance formula:
\[
AD = \sqrt{\left(10 + \frac{15}{22}\right)^2 + \left(0 - \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{325}{22}
\]

Using the power of a point theorem, we find \( DB \) and use it to compute \( DP \):
\[
DB^2 = \left(\frac{225}{22}\right)^2 = DP \cdot DA \implies DP = \frac{2025}{286}
\]

Finally, we calculate \( AP \) as:
\[
AP = AD - DP = \frac{325}{22} - \frac{2025}{286} = \frac{100}{13}
\]

Thus, \( AP \) can be written as \( \frac{100}{13} \), and \( m + n = 100 + 13 = 113 \).

\[
\boxed{113}
\]
