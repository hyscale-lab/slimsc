Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice. So I need to figure out for which n Bob can force a win, meaning those n are losing positions for Alice.

This seems like a classic combinatorial game theory problem, probably involving determining winning and losing positions. I remember that in such games, positions can often be classified as either "winning" or "losing." A winning position means the current player can force a win, while a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the idea is to find all n where the starting position is a losing position for Alice, which would mean Bob can win. Let's denote P(n) as the position with n tokens. If from P(n), any move leads to a winning position for the opponent, then P(n) is a losing position.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's think about the base cases.

- If n = 0, the game is over, so that's a losing position because there are no tokens to take. But in our problem, n is a positive integer, so maybe we don't need to consider n=0.
- If n = 1, the player can take 1 token and win. So P(1) is a winning position.
- If n = 2, the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no, if I take 1 from 2, opponent gets 1 and takes it to win. So if I have n=2, I can take 1 and leave 1, but then opponent takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, can I take 4 tokens? No, because 4 > 2. So for n=2, the only move is to take 1, which leads to opponent winning. So P(2) is a losing position? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n=2, the player can take 1, leaving 1
