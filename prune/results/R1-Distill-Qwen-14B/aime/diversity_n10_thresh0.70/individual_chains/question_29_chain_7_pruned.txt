Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We're given the lengths BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let's start by visualizing the problem. I imagine rectangle ABCD with AB=107 and BC=16. So AB is the longer side, and BC is the shorter side. That makes ABCD a rectangle where AB is horizontal (assuming standard orientation), BC is vertical. So, let's assign coordinates to these points to make it easier.

Let me set point D as the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107 and BC=16, point C would be at (107, 16), right? So point A is at (0,16) and point B is at (107,0). Wait, no, that can't be right because if D is (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to C is along the x-axis 107 units, and from D to A is along the y-axis 16 units. So point C is (107,0), A is (0,16), B is (107,16), and D is (0,0). That makes sense because BC is 16, which is the vertical side.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Let's see. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D (0,0), E, C (107,0), and F lie on the same line. Since C is at (107,0), and D is at (0,0), it's the x-axis. So E and F must also lie somewhere on the x-axis.

In rectangle EFGH, sides FG=17 and EF=184. So, EF is one side, FG is another. Since EFGH is a rectangle, EF and FG are adjacent sides. Let me think about the sides. EF is 184, which is the longer side, and FG is 17, the shorter side.

If E is on the x-axis, then E must be somewhere between D (0,0) and C (107,0), or maybe even extended beyond. Let's denote point E as (x,0). Since E and F are on the x-axis, and EFGH is a rectangle, point F will be at (x + 184, 0), assuming EF is horizontal. Wait, no, because EF is a side of the rectangle, but EF is 184, which is horizontal if E and F are on the x-axis. But then FG is 17, which should be vertical. So point G would be at (x + 184, 17) and point H at (x, 17). Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular, so that makes sense.

Wait, but if E is on the x-axis, then F is also on the x-axis, so FG is vertical upwards. So H and G are above E and F, respectively. So, EFGH has coordinates: E (x,0), F (x + 184,0), G (x + 184,17), H (x,17). Got it.

Now, the other condition is that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (x,17), G (x + 184,17) lie on a circle. So, we need to find the value of x such that these four points lie on
