Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes she spends in a coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed by 2 km/h, making it 's + 2' km/h, the walking time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. The question is asking, if she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, how many minutes will her walk take her, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, okay. So I think the key here is to set up equations based on the information given. Let's break it down.

First, I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, when she walks at speed 's', the time she spends walking is 4 hours minus the time she spends in the coffee shop. Wait, but the problem says the total time is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop. So, the actual walking time is 4 hours minus 't' minutes. Similarly, when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, right? Because 24 minutes is 0.4 of an hour. So that's 2.4 hours, which includes the same 't' minutes, meaning her walking time is 2.4 hours minus t minutes.

Wait, but hold on, 't' is in minutes, so I should probably convert everything to hours or everything to minutes to avoid confusion. Maybe converting 't' into hours would make sense since the speeds are in km/h. 

Alternatively, since the problem gives both scenarios with different speeds and the same coffee shop time, we can set up two equations and solve for 's' and 't'.

Let me define 't' in hours for consistency. So, t is in hours. Since t is given in minutes in the problem, I can write t as t_minutes / 60.

So, for the first scenario:

Walking speed = s km/h
Total time including coffee shop = 4 hours
Therefore, walking time = 4 - t hours
But the walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed, which is 9 km / s.

So, 9/s = 4 - t.

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time including coffee shop = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours: 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.
Walking time = 2.4 - t hours
And walking time is also 9 / (s + 2).

So, 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t.

Now I have two equations:

1. 9/s = 4 - t
2. 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t

I can solve these two equations to find 's' and 't'.

Let me write them down:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - t
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t

Hmm, maybe subtract equation 2 from equation 1 or something like that. Let's see.

First, let's solve both equations for t.

From Equation 1: t = 4 - 9/s

From Equation 2: t = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

Since both equal t, set them equal to each other:

4 - 9/s = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

Now, let's solve for s.

So,

4 - 9/s = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

Let me subtract 2.4 from both sides:

4 - 2.4 - 9/s = -9/(s + 2)

Which simplifies to:

1.6 - 9/s = -9/(s + 2)

Let me bring all terms to one side:

1.6 = -9/(s + 2) + 9/s

Hmm, maybe it's better to rearrange the equation:

1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

Let me compute the right-hand side:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 9[(s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2))] = 9[2/(s(s + 2))] = 18/(s(s + 2))

So, 1.6 = 18/(s(s + 2))

Therefore:

1.6 * s(s + 2) = 18

Let me compute 1.6 as a fraction to make it easier. 1.6 is 8/5.

So,

(8/5) * s(s + 2) = 18

Multiply both sides by 5:

8 * s(s + 2) = 90

Divide both sides by 8:

s(s + 2) = 90 / 8 = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, solve this quadratic equation for s.

Quadratic equation: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

We can use the quadratic formula:

s = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = 4 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So sqrt(49) = 7

Thus, s = [-2 ±7]/2

Since speed can't be negative, we take the positive solution:

s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

Wait, that's interesting. So Aya's original speed is 2.5 km
