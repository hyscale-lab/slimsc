Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out all the given information to make sure I don't miss anything. The total number of residents is 900. Now, the number of people owning each specific item is as follows:

- Diamond rings: 195
- Golf clubs: 367
- Garden spades: 562
- Candy hearts: Well, every resident owns this, so that's 900.

Additionally, it's given that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're looking for the number of people who own all four.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps in calculating the union of multiple sets by adding up the sizes of the sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. But in this case, we're given some specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three items, so I might need to adjust my approach.

Let me denote the sets as follows:

- Let D be the set of people owning diamond rings.
- Let G be the set of people owning golf clubs.
- Let S be the set of people owning garden spades.
- Let C be the set of people owning candy hearts. Since everyone owns a candy heart, C has 900 elements.

We need to find the number of people who are in all four sets, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.

But wait, since C is everyone, the intersection of all four is the same as the intersection of D, G, and S. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number of people who own all three (D, G, S), since C is universal.

Wait, but the problem says 234 own exactly three of these things. Does that include the candy hearts? Or does it mean exactly three of the other three items? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says 234 own exactly three of these things, so I think that must include the candy hearts because C is one of the four things. So, when it says "exactly three," it's referring to any three of the four items. But since everyone owns C, any person who owns exactly three must own C plus two others. So, for example, someone could own D, G, and C, but not S. Or D, S, and C, but not G, etc.

Similarly, the 437 who own exactly two would be owning any two of the four, but since C is a must for everyone, they must own C plus exactly one other. So, for example, someone owns D and C, but not G or S. Or G and C, etc.
