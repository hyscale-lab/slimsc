Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner. Each path has a length of 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid requires moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Now, the catch is that these paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The grid is 8x8, so it's like a chessboard with 8 rows and 8 columns. The starting point is the lower left corner, which I'll consider as (0,0), and the endpoint is the upper right corner at (8,8). Each path is made up of moving either right or up, but you can't move left or down. So, each path is a sequence of right and up moves.

Now, the paths must change direction exactly four times. Changing direction means switching from moving right to up or from up to right. So, every time the direction changes, it alternates between right and up. For example, if a path starts by moving right, then changes direction to up, then right again, and so on, each switch counts as a change.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of runs or segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. Each direction change would mean the start of a new segment. So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many segments does that create?

Well, if you start moving right, each direction change adds a new segment. So, four direction changes would lead to five segments. Wait, no. Wait, if you start moving right, one change to up makes two segments. So, four direction changes would create five segments in total. Because each change adds a new segment. So, yes, four changes lead to five segments.

Now, these five segments must consist of alternating right and up moves. So, the path starts with either right or up, then alternates each time. So, the number of segments of each direction depends on whether the number of segments is odd or even.

Wait, five segments. If it starts with right, then the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if it starts with up, then the segments would be up, right, up, right, up. So, three up segments and two right segments. Either way, the number of segments of each direction differs by one.

But wait, since the total steps in right and up must each be 8, because it's an 8x8 grid. So, if I have three right segments and two up segments, each right segment must add up to 8, and same for the up segments.

Hmm, so let's think about the case where the path starts with a right move. So, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. Each right segment must sum to 8, but how?

Wait, no. Each right segment is a consecutive number of right moves, and similarly for up. So, each right segment has some number of right steps, say k1, k2, k3, and similarly for up segments, say m1, m2. So, the
