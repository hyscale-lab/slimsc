Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. 

It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay.

So, the first part is to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Then, once we find that p, we need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². 

Let me think about primes and their properties. I know that primes can be classified based on certain properties, like whether they are congruent to 1 mod 4 or 3 mod 4. Since this problem involves fourth powers, maybe something related to modulo arithmetic will come into play.

First, I should check small primes and see if any of them satisfy the condition that p² divides n⁴ + 1. The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let me start with the smallest primes and work my way up.

Starting with p=2: Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 2²=4. So, n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 4. Let me compute n⁴ mod 4 for various n.

If n is even, say n=2k, then n⁴ = (2k)^4 = 16k^4, which is 0 mod 4. So, n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod 4, which is not congruent to 0 mod 4.

If n is odd, say n=2k+1, then n⁴ = (2k+1)^4. Let's compute that modulo 4. Expanding, (2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k +1. Each term except 1 is divisible by 4, so mod 4, this is 1. Therefore, n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod 4, which is not 0. Hmm, so for p=2, there's no n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is p=3. Let's check if 3²=9 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, n⁴ ≡-1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for various n.

I can test n from 1 to 8 mod 9, since it's modulo 9.

n=1: 1⁴=1. 1 +1=2 mod 9. Not 0.

n=2: 2⁴=16. 16 mod 9 is 7. 7+1=8 mod 9. Not 0.

n=3: 3⁴=81. 81 mod9=0. 0+1=1 mod9. Not 0.

n=4: 4 mod9=4. 4⁴=256. 256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4⁴=4 mod9. 4+1=5 mod9. Not 0.

n=5: 5 mod9=5. 5⁴: 5²=25≡7, so 5⁴=(5²)²=7²=49≡4 mod9. 4+1=5 mod9. Not 0.

n=6: 6⁴. 6 mod9=6. 6²=36≡0, so 6⁴=0. 0+1=1 mod9.

n=7: 7 mod9=7. 7²=49≡4, 7⁴=(7²)²=4²=16≡7 mod9. 7+1=8 mod9. Not 0.

n=8: 8 mod9=8. 8²=64≡1, 8⁴=(8²)²=1²=1 mod9. 1+1=2 mod9.

n=9: same as n=0, which isn't positive, so stop here.

So, for p=3, there's no n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9. So 3 is out.

Next prime, p=5. Let's check if 5²=25 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, n⁴ ≡-1 mod25.

I need to find if such an n exists where n⁴ ≡24 mod25.

Let me try n from 1 to 24 mod25.

But that's a lot, maybe I can find a pattern or use some properties.

Alternatively, I remember that the multiplicative group modulo 25 is cyclic of order φ(25)=20. So, for n to satisfy n⁴ ≡24 mod25, 24 must be a fourth power residue modulo25.

Wait, since 24 is equivalent to -1 mod25, so we can write n⁴ ≡-1 mod25.

So, to find n where n⁴ ≡-1 mod25. Let me see if such an n exists.

I can try some small numbers.

n=2: 2⁴=16 mod25. 16≡16, not 24.

n=3: 81 mod25 is 6. 6≡6, nope.

n=4: 256 mod25: 25*10=250, 256-250=6. So 4⁴=256≡6 mod25.

n=5:5⁴=625≡0 mod25.

n=6:6⁴=1296. 1296 mod25: 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21. So 6⁴=21 mod25.

n=7:7⁴=2401. 2401 mod25: 25*96=2400, 2401-2400=1. So 7⁴=1 mod25.

n=8:8⁴=4096. 4096 mod25: 25*163=4075, 4096-4075=21. So 8⁴=21 mod25.

n=9:9⁴=6561. 6561 mod25: 25*262=6550, 6561-6550=11. So 9⁴=11 mod25.

n=10:10⁴=10000≡0.

n=11:11⁴=14641. 14641 mod25: 25*585=14625, 14641-14625=16. So 11⁴=16 mod25.

n=12:12⁴=20736. 20736 mod25: 25*829=20725, 20736-20725=11. So 12⁴=11 mod25.

n=13:13⁴=28561. 28561 mod25: 25*1142=28550, 28561-28550=11. So 13⁴=11 mod25.

n=14:14⁴=38416. 38416 mod25: 25*1536=38400, 38416-38400=16. So 14⁴=16 mod25.

n=15:15⁴=50625≡0 mod25.

n=16:16⁴=65536. 65536 mod25: 25*2621=65525, 65536-65525=11. So 16⁴=11 mod25.

n=17:17⁴=83521. 83521 mod25: 25*3340=83500, 83521-83500=21. So 17⁴=21 mod25.

n=18:18⁴=104976. 104976 mod25: 25*4199=104975, 104976-104975=1. So 18⁴=1 mod25.

n=19:19⁴=130321. 130321 mod25: 25*5212=130300, 130321-130300=21. So 19⁴=21 mod25.

n=20:20⁴=160000≡0 mod25.

n=21:21⁴=194481. 194481 mod25: 25*7779=194475, 194481-194475=6. So 21⁴=6 mod25.

n=22:22⁴=234256. 234256 mod25: 25*9370=234250, 234256-234250=6. So 22⁴=6 mod25.

n=23:23⁴=279841. 279841 mod25: 25*11193=279825, 279841-279825=16. So 23⁴=16 mod25.

n=24:24⁴=331776. 331776 mod25: 25*13271=331775, 331776-331775=1. So 24⁴=1 mod25.

Hmm, looking through all these, I don't see any n where n⁴ ≡24 mod25. So, for p=5, there's no n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 25. So, p=5 is out.

Next prime, p=7. Let's check if 7²=49 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, n⁴ ≡-1 mod49.

I need to find if there exists n where n⁴ ≡48 mod49.

Again, let's see if such an n exists. The multiplicative group mod49 is cyclic of order φ(49)=42. So, the fourth powers will form a subgroup. We need to see if -1 is in this subgroup.

Alternatively, using Euler's criterion, for prime p, -1 is a quadratic residue mod p² if p ≡1 mod4. But 7≡3 mod4, so -1 is not a quadratic residue mod7, but what about mod49? Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, 7 is 3 mod4. Let me try to compute n⁴ mod49 for some n.

Let me try n=2: 2⁴=16. 16+1=17 mod49. Not 0.

n=3: 81 mod49 is 32. 32+1=33 mod49. Not zero.

n=4: 256 mod49. 49*5=245, 256-245=11. 11+1=12. Not zero.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod49: 49*49=2401, so 0. 0+1=1. Not zero.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod49. Let's compute 49*83=4067, 4096-4067=29. 29+1=30. Not zero.

n=9: 9⁴=6561. 6561 mod49. 49*133=6517, 6561-6517=44. 44+1=45. Not zero.

n=10: 10⁴=10000. 10000 mod49. Let's compute 49*204=9996, 10000-9996=4. 4+1=5. Not zero.

n=11: 11⁴=14641. 14641 mod49. Let me see, 49*298=14502, 14641-14502=139. 139-2*49=139-98=41. 41+1=42. Not zero.

n=12: 12⁴=20736. 20736 mod49. Let's see, 49*423=20727, 20736-20727=9. 9+1=10. Not zero.

n=13: 13⁴=28561. 28561 mod49. 49*582=28518, 28561-28518=43. 43+1=44. Not zero.

n=14: 14⁴=38416. 38416 mod49. 49*784=38416, so 0. 0+1=1. Not zero.

n=15:15⁴=50625. 50625 mod49. Let's compute 49*1033=50617, 50625-50617=8. 8+1=9. Not zero.

n=16:16⁴=65536. 65536 mod49. 49*1337=65513, 65536-65513=23. 23+1=24. Not zero.

n=17:17⁴=83521. 83521 mod49. 49*1704=83500, 83521-83500=21. 21+1=22. Not zero.

n=18:18⁴=104976. 104976 mod49. 49*2142=104958, 104976-104958=18. 18+1=19. Not zero.

n=19:19⁴=130321. 130321 mod49. Let's see, 49*2659=130300, 130321-130300=21. 21+1=22. Not zero.

n=20:20⁴=160000. 160000 mod49. 49*3265=160000- let me compute 49*3265: 49*(3000+265)=49*3000=147000, 49*265=12985. So 147000+12985= 159,985. 160000-159985=15. 15+1=16. Not zero.

n=21:21⁴=194481. 194481 mod49. 49*3969=194,481. So 0. 0+1=1. Not zero.

n=22:22⁴=234256. 234256 mod49. Let's compute 49*4780=234,220. 234256-234220=36. 36+1=37. Not zero.

n=23:23⁴=279841. 279841 mod49. 49*5711=279,839. 279841-279839=2. 2+1=3. Not zero.

n=24:24⁴=331776. 331776 mod49. 49*6771=331,779. 331776-331779 is negative, so perhaps 49*6770=331,730. 331776-331730=46. 46+1=47. Not zero.

n=25:25⁴=390625. 390625 mod49. 49*7972=390,628. 390625-390628= -3 → 46 mod49. 46+1=47. Not zero.

Hmm, seems like for p=7, I can't find any n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 49. So p=7 is out.

Next prime is 11. Let me check if p=11 works. So, 11²=121. We need to find n where n⁴ ≡-1 mod121. That is, n⁴ ≡120 mod121.

This might take a while, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think.

I remember that if p is a prime where -1 is a fourth power residue mod p², then p must satisfy certain conditions. For primes where p ≡1 mod8, maybe. Let me recall.

Wait, for primes p ≡1 mod4, -1 is a quadratic residue mod p. But for p ≡3 mod4, -1 is not a quadratic residue. But we are dealing with fourth powers here.

So, perhaps p needs to be 1 mod8 or something like that. Let me check.

Wait, 11 is 3 mod4 (since 11=2*5 +1, no, wait, 11=3*3 +2. Hmm, 11 mod4 is 3, because 4*2=8, 11-8=3. So 11 ≡3 mod4. So, maybe it's possible that -1 is not a fourth power residue mod11².

Alternatively, perhaps I can
