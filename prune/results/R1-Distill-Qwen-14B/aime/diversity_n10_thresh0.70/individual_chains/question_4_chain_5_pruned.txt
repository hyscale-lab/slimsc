Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. It sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, the starting player is Alice, and Bob is the second player. We need to find n where Bob can always win, regardless of Alice's moves. That would mean that for those n, the position is a losing position for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob can take advantage of that.

Let me think about small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no, because if Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. But wait, that would mean Bob wins, which would mean n=2 is a winning position for Bob? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, let me clarify. If Alice can force a win from n=2, then it's a winning position for Alice. If not, then it's a losing position, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, let's model it step by step.

Let me define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). A position is W if the current player can force a win. It's L if no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Base cases:

n=0: No tokens left, game over. So the player who cannot move loses. So n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: Current player takes 1 and wins. So W.

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes 1 and wins. So if current player takes 1, opponent wins. Alternatively, can the current player take
