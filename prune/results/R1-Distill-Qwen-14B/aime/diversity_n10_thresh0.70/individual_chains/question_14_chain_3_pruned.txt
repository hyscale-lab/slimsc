Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. My goal is to find the largest such N that satisfies this specific divisibility condition. Once I have N, I can divide it by 1000 to get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder), and then add them together.

Let me break this down. The key property is that if you change any one digit of N to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies this condition. But that might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the structure of N. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number.

Now, the condition is that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit, replacing it with 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

Let me write down the four conditions:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be 0 modulo 7.

Let me consider each condition.

Starting with condition 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

I can compute 1000 mod 7 to simplify. Let's calculate:

7*142 = 994. 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Therefore, condition 1 becomes:

6 + (100b mod 7) + (10c mod 7) + (d mod 7) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, let's compute 100 mod 7:

7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

So, condition 1:

6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, let's compute the other conditions.

Condition 2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Compute each term mod 7:

1000a ≡ 6a mod 7.

100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10c ≡ 3c mod 7.

d ≡ d mod 7.

So, condition 2 becomes:

6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 3: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Compute each term mod 7:

1000a ≡6a.

100b ≡2b.

10 ≡3.

d ≡d.

So, condition 3:

6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7.

Condition 4: 1000a + 100b + 10c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Compute each term mod7:

1000a≡6a.

100b≡2b.

10c≡3c.

1≡1.

So, condition4:

6a + 2b +3c +1≡0 mod7.

So, now I have four conditions:

1. 6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7. (from changing a to 1)
2. 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7. (from changing b to1)
3.6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7. (from changing c to1)
4.6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7. (from changing d to1)

So, these are the four modular equations.

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Let me label them as Eq1, Eq2, Eq3, Eq4.

Eq1: 2b +3c +d ≡ -6 mod7 → 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7)

Eq2:6a +3c +d ≡ -2 mod7 →6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7

Eq3:6a +2b +d ≡ -3 mod7 →6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7

Eq4:6a +2b +3c ≡ -1 mod7 →6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7

Wait, maybe subtracting equations can help.

Let me see: Eq2 - Eq1:

(6a +3c +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡5 -1 mod7

So, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, let's compute this:

6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as 6a ≡2b +4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, we can multiply by inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7). So, multiplying both sides by 4:

(6a)*4 ≡ (2b +4)*4 mod7.

24a ≡8b +16 mod7.

But 24 mod7 is 3 (7*3=21; 24-21=3), 8 mod7 is1, 16 mod7 is2.

So, 3a ≡b +2 mod7.

So, 3a -b ≡2 mod7 → b ≡3a -2 mod7.

That's one relationship: b is congruent to 3a -2 mod7.

Let me note that as Eq5: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

Now, let's subtract Eq3 - Eq1:

(6a +2b +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡4 -1 mod7.

So, 6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

That can be written as 6a ≡3c +3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3: 2a ≡c +1 mod7.

So, 2a -c ≡1 mod7 → c ≡2a -1 mod7.

Let's call this Eq6: c ≡2a -1 mod7.

Now, let's subtract Eq4 - Eq3:

(6a +2b +3c) - (6a +2b +d) ≡6 -4 mod7.

So, 3c -d ≡2 mod7.

So, 3c -d ≡2 mod7 → d ≡3c -2 mod7.

Let me call this Eq7: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

Now, let's also subtract Eq4 - Eq2:

(6a +2b +3c) - (6a +3c +d) ≡6 -5 mod7.

So, 2b -d ≡1 mod7.

Which is 2b -d ≡1 mod7 → d ≡2b -1 mod7.

Let's call this Eq8: d ≡2b -1 mod7.

But from Eq7 and Eq8, we have:

From Eq7: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

From Eq8: d ≡2b -1 mod7.

So, 3c -2 ≡2b -1 mod7.

Simplify: 3c -2 -2b +1 ≡0 mod7 →3c -2b -1 ≡0 mod7.

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Eq9.

But from Eq5: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

And from Eq6: c ≡2a -1 mod7.

So, let's substitute b and c in terms of a into Eq9.

So, 3c -2b ≡3*(2a -1) -2*(3a -2) mod7.

Compute:

3*(2a -1) =6a -3.

-2*(3a -2) =-6a +4.

So, overall: 6a -3 -6a +4 = (6a -6a) + (-3 +4) = 0a +1 ≡1 mod7.

So, 1 ≡1 mod7. Which holds true.

So, our substitutions are consistent.

So, we can express b, c, d in terms of a.

So, from Eq5: b = (3a -2) mod7.

From Eq6: c = (2a -1) mod7.

From Eq7: d = (3c -2) mod7.

But since c = (2a -1) mod7, substitute into d:

d = 3*(2a -1) -2 mod7.

=6a -3 -2 mod7.

=6a -5 mod7.

Alternatively, from Eq8: d =2b -1 mod7.

But since b =3a -2 mod7, d =2*(3a -2) -1 mod7.

=6a -4 -1 mod7.

=6a -5 mod7.

Which is the same as previous, so that's consistent.

So, now we have expressions for b, c, d in terms of a:

b ≡3a -2 mod7,

c ≡2a -1 mod7,

d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Now, since a, b, c, d are digits (0-9), we can write:

b =3a -2 +7k1,

c=2a -1 +7k2,

d=6a -5 +7k3,

where k1, k2, k3 are integers such that b, c, d are between 0 and9.

Since a is a digit (1-9, since it's the thousands digit), let's see possible values for a.

Our goal is to find the largest possible four-digit number N=abcd, so we should start with a=9 and work our way down.

So, let me try a=9.

Compute b, c, d modulo7, then adjust with k1, k2, k3 to get digits between 0-
