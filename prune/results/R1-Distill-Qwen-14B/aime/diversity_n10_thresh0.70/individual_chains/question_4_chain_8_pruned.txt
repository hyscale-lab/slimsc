Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me first understand the rules. Alice goes first, then Bob, and so on. Each turn, a player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. The last one to take a token wins. So the goal is to be the one who takes the last token. 

I think this is a combinatorial game, so maybe I can model it using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, I need to figure out for each n, whether the starting position is a winning or losing position. If it's a losing position for Alice, then Bob can win, regardless of Alice's moves. Therefore, the number of such n's where the starting position is a losing position is the answer.

Let me try to model this step by step.

Let's denote:

- P(n): the position when there are n tokens left.
- If the current player can force a win from P(n), then P(n) is a winning position.
- Else, it's a losing position.

Base cases:

- P(0): No tokens left. The game is over. So, the player who just moved is the winner. Therefore, P(0) is a losing position because the current player can't make a move.
- P(1): The current player can take 1 token and win. So, P(1) is a winning position.
- P(4): The current player can take 4 tokens and win. So, P(4) is a winning position.
- Wait, but what about n less than 0? That doesn't make sense, so probably we can ignore those.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple pattern that can be found by testing small n's.

Let me start by calculating P(n) for small n and see if I can find a pattern.

n=0: losing (L)
n=1: current player takes 1 and wins (W)
n=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Since n=1 is a W position for the opponent, opponent can win. So, is n=2 a L position? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, in n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position for the opponent. So the opponent can win from n=1. Alternatively, the current player could take 4 tokens, but that's not possible since n=2 <4. So, the current player has only one move: take 1, leading to n=1, which is a W position for the opponent. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position (L) for the current player.

Wait, no. If the current player takes 1 token from n=2, the opponent is left with n
