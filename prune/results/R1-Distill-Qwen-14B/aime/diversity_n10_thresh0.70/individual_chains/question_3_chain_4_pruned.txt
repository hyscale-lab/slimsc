Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. If all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability can be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, P(A|B) is the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

Let me think about what these events mean.

First, winning the grand prize (A) means that all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers. So, A is a subset of B because if she wins the grand prize, she definitely wins a prize.

So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), because if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) = P(A).

Therefore, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B)

So, I need to calculate P(A) and P(B).

Let me start by calculating P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize.

The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is given by the combination formula C(10, 4). So, the total number of possible outcomes is C(10, 4).

The number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, because there's only one way to pick exactly the four numbers that are chosen randomly.

Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10, 4)

Calculating C(10,4):

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210

So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, I need to find P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, B includes all the cases where she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 matching numbers.

Alternatively, it's easier sometimes to calculate the probability of the complement event and subtract it from 1. The complement of winning a prize is not winning a prize, which means she has fewer than 2 matching numbers, i.e., 0 or 1 matching number.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match)

Therefore, I need to compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

Let me recall how to compute these hypergeometric probabilities because this is a hypergeometric distribution problem.

In general, the probability of exactly k matches when selecting 4 numbers is given by:

P(k) = [C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k)] / C(10, 4)

Wait, wait, let me think about that again. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers is C(10,4). The number of favorable ways for exactly k matches is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because we need to choose k numbers from Jen's 4, and the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the 6 numbers she didn't pick.

So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, P(k) = [C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k)] / C(10, 4)

So, let's compute P(0) and P(1).

P(0) = [C(4,0) * C(6,4)] / C(10,4)

C(4,0) is 1, C(6,4) is 15. So, P(0) = (1 * 15) / 210 = 15/210 = 1/14

Similarly, P(1) = [C(4,1) * C(6,3)] / C(10,4)

C(4,1) is 4, C(6,3) is 20. So, P(1) = (4 * 20) / 210 = 80/210 = 8/21

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) = 1 - 1/14 - 8/21

Let me compute that.

First, find a common denominator for 14 and 21, which is 42.

So, 1/14 = 3/42, 8/21 = 16/42.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 3/42 - 16/42 = 1 - (19/42) = (42/42 - 19/42) = 23/42

So, P(B) = 23/42

Wait, let me double-check that.

1 - 1/14 - 8/21:

1 is 42/42,

1/14 is 3/42,

8/21 is 16/42.

So, 42/42 - 3/42 - 16/42 = (42 - 3 -16)/42 = (23)/42. Yes, correct.

So, P(B) = 23/42.

We already have P(A) = 1/210.

So, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/
