Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: one is a function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and the other is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Both functions involve these f and g functions, which are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. 

First, I think I should understand what f and g look like. Maybe if I can sketch their graphs or understand their properties, it'll help me figure out the behavior of the composite functions in the problem.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The absolute value function |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 inside the absolute value affects the position. So, |x| - 1/2 shifts the graph down by 1/2 units. But since we have another absolute value outside, it reflects any negative parts back up. Let me think about this step by step.

If I consider |x|, that's the same as √(x²). Then subtracting 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This would create a V-shape that's shifted down by 1/2. The points where |x| - 1/2 is zero are when |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So the graph of |x| - 1/2 would touch the x-axis at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0) and have a vertex at (0, -1/2). But then we take the absolute value of that: ||x| - 1/2|. 

So, the parts of |x| - 1/2 that are negative (which is between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2) will be reflected above the x-axis. So the graph of f(x) will have a W-shape or maybe a double V. Let me consider specific points.

At x=0: f(0) = ||0| - 1/2| = | -1/2 | = 1/2.

At x=1/2: f(1/2) = ||1/2| - 1/2| = |0| = 0.

At x=1: f(1) = ||1| - 1/2| = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

Similarly for negative x, since it's all absolute values, it's symmetric. So the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that touches zero at x = ±1/2, goes up to 1/2 at x=0, then another V beyond that. So it's like two Vs: one from -1/2 to 1/2, reaching up at 0, and another from there to infinity, but since it's symmetric, it's more like a W.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that.

At x=0: g(0) = ||0| -1/4| = 1/4.

At x=1/4: g(1/4) = 0.

At x=1/2: g(1/2) = ||1/2| -1/4| = |1/2 -1/4| = 1/4.

So the graph of g(x) is similar to f(x) but with smaller shifts. It's a V-shape that touches zero at x=±1/4, goes up to 1/4 at x=0, and then repeats. So it's a W-shape as well but with a different width.

Now, both f and g are even functions because they only involve absolute values, so they're symmetric about the y-axis.

Next, let's consider the composite functions in the problem.

First, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

Let me unpack this. The innermost function is sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 2π/(2π) = 1. So it's a sine wave that completes one full cycle every 1 unit along the x-axis. The amplitude is 1, so sin(2πx) ranges from -1 to 1.

Then, f is applied to sin(2πx): f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 can range from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that, ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|, will range from 0 to 1/2. So f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g is applied to that result: g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|.

Wait, but since f(sin(2πx)) is non-negative (as it's an absolute value), the inner absolute is redundant. So g(f(...)) = |f(...) - 1/4|.

But f(...) ranges from 0 to 1/2, so f(...) - 1/4 ranges from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking the absolute value, g(f(...)) will range from 0 to 1/4.

Finally, multiplying by 4: 4 * g(f(...)) will range from 0 to 1.

So y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1, with a period determined by the sine function, which is 1. But because it's wrapped through multiple absolute functions, the actual shape is more complex.

Similarly, the other equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's analyze that.

The inner function is cos(3πy). The cosine function has a period of 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So cos(3πy) completes a full cycle every 2/3 units along the y-axis. The amplitude is 1, so it ranges from -1 to 1.

Then, f is applied: f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|.

Again, |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, so ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2| will range between 0 and 1/2. Then g is applied to that: ||f(...) - 1/4|, which will range from 0 to 1/4. Multiplying by 4 gives x ranging from 0 to 1.

So x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is a function where x oscillates between 0 and 1 as y varies, with a period of 2/3.

Now, the problem is to find the number of intersections between y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Each intersection point is a solution (x, y) that satisfies both equations.

Alternatively, we can think of this as solving the system:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, for each x, y is determined by the first equation, and then for that y, x is determined by the second equation. The intersections are the points where x and y satisfy both equations.

This seems a bit tricky because x depends on y and y depends on x. Perhaps I can consider substituting one into the other.

Let me denote y as a function of x from the first equation: y = h(x), where h(x) = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Then, substituting into the second equation, x = 4g(f(cos(3πh(x)))). So, we need to solve x = 4g(f(cos(3πh(x)))). 

But that's a complicated equation because h(x) is already a composite function. Maybe instead of trying to solve it algebraically, I can analyze the behavior of these functions and see how many times they intersect.

Alternatively, perhaps I can plot or understand the periodicity and the number of intersections in each period.

Given that both functions are periodic, maybe I can find the number of intersections in a specific interval and then multiply by the number of periods.

Looking at the first function, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Since sin(2πx) has a period of 1, and it's wrapped through f
