Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (xy).

Similarly, let's go back to equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z from equation (z), so let's substitute that.

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Compute 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's call this equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy), we have x y = 2^(-2/3). But y is x * 2^(-1/12), so substitute that in:

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Simplify:

x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12):

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12). Taking square root:

x = 2^(-7/24). Since x is positive. Let me write that as equation (x).

Now, knowing x, we can find y from equation (y): y = x * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12)

Compute exponents: (-7/24) + (-2/24) = (-9/24) = (-3/8). So:

y = 2^(-3/8)

So y = 2^(-3/8). Let's write that as equation (y).

Now, let me recap:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me check these to see if they satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log₂(x/(y z)).

Compute x/(y z):

= [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)]

= 2^(-7/24) / (2^(-3/8 -5/12)).

Compute exponents in denominator: -3/8 = -9/24, -5/12 = -10/24. So total exponent: -19/24.

So denominator is 2^(-19/24), so overall:

x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 +19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2). So log₂(2^(1/2)) = 1/2, which matches equation 1.

Good. Second equation: log₂(y/(x z)).

Compute y/(x z):

= [2^(-3/8)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12)]

Compute denominator exponents: -7/24 + (-5/12) = -7/24 -10/24 = -17/24.

So y/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-9/24 +17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3). So log₂(2^(1/3)) = 1/3. Correct.

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)).

Compute z/(x y):

= [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)]

Compute denominator exponents: -7/24 + (-9/24) = -16/24 = -2/3.

So z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-2/3) = 2^(-5/12 +8/12) = 2^(3/12) = 2^(1/4). Log₂ gives 1/4. Correct.

All equations are satisfied. So x, y, z are correct.

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|. Let's compute that.

First, compute x^4 y^3 z^2.

Expressed in exponents:

x^4 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y^3 = [2^(-3/8)]^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z^2 = [2^(-5/12)]^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply all together:

x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Add exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6. Let's find a common denominator, which is 24.

Convert each:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Sum: -28 -27 -20 = -75; so exponent is -75/24. Simplify:

-75/24 = -25/8.

So x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8). Therefore, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8.

So m =25, n=8. They are coprime. So m +n=33.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( m + n \) is \boxed{33}.


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\) implies \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\) implies \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\) implies \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Substituting these expressions into each other, we solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

From equation 1: \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\)

Substitute \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\) into this:

\[x = (xz \cdot 2^{1/3}) z \cdot 2^{1/2}\]
\[x = xz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}\]
\[1 = z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}\]
\[z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\]
\[z = 2^{-5/12}\]

From equation 3: \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Substitute \(z = 2^{-5/12}\):

\[2^{-5/12} = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\]
\[xy = 2^{-2/3}\]

From equation 2: \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)

Substitute \(z = 2^{-5/12}\):

\[y = x \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/3}\]
\[y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\]

Substitute \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\) into \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\):

\[x \cdot (x \cdot 2^{-1/12}) = 2^{-2/3}\]
\[x^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-2/3}\]
\[x^2 = 2^{-7/12}\]
\[x = 2^{-7/24}\]

Now, we have:
- \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)
- \(y = 2^{-3/8}\)
- \(z = 2^{-5/12}\)

We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

Calculate \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):
- \(x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}\)
- \(y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}\)
- \(z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}\)

Combine these:
\[x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6}\]
\[= 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6}\]
Convert to a common denominator (24):
\[= 2^{-28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24}\]
\[= 2^{-75/24}\]
\[= 2^{-25/8}\]

Thus, \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8\). Taking the absolute value, we get \(25/8\).

Therefore, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
