Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The first graph is given by the equation y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second one is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Both functions involve compositions of f and g, which are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. 

Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down. First, I should probably understand what the functions f and g look like. Since both are absolute value functions subtracted by constants and then taken absolute again, they're going to have some V-shape characteristics.

Let me plot f(x) first. f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So, the inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. This would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, ||x| - 1/2|, any negative parts will be flipped up.

So, when is |x| - 1/2 negative? That happens when |x| < 1/2. So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| is less than 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is negative. Taking absolute of that will flip it, so f(x) becomes (1/2 - |x|) in that interval. Outside of that, when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) is just |x| - 1/2.

So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph that has a peak at x=0 with y=1/2, then slopes down on both sides until it hits y=0 at x=±1/2, and then continues as lines with slope 1 beyond that.

Similarly, let me think about g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Using the same logic, the inner function is |x| - 1/4. The absolute value makes it V-shaped. When |x| < 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is negative, so the outer absolute makes it 1/4 - |x|. When |x| >= 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4.

So, g(x) is a V-shape that has a peak at x=0 with y=1/4, slopes down to zero at x=±1/4, and then slopes up beyond that.

Okay, so now I need to analyze f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's take it step by step.

First, sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, since the argument is 2πx. So as x increases, it completes a full cycle every 1 unit. The range of sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1.

Now, applying f to sin(2πx), let's see:

f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. So, let's think about the input to f. The inner | sin(2πx) | ranges between 0 and 1.

So, f(z) where z is between 0 and 1. Let me consider z in [0,1]:

For z < 1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - z.

For z >= 1/2, f(z) = z - 1/2.

So, when sin(2πx) is in [0,1/2], f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - sin(2πx).

When sin(2πx) is in [1/2,1], f(sin(2πx)) = sin(2πx) - 1/2.

Similarly, since sin is between -1 and 1, but we take absolute, so the input to f is always non-negative.

So, f(sin(2πx)) will have a shape that's a transformation of the sine wave.

Wait, but since sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1, and it's being transformed by f, which is a piecewise linear function, the composition will have a certain number of peaks and valleys.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of the range of f(sin(2πx)).

The maximum value of sin(2πx) is 1, so f(1) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

The minimum value of |sin(2πx)| is 0, so f(0) = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2.

Wait, hold on, that can't be right because f(z) when z=0 is 1/2, and when z=1/2, f(z)=0, and when z=1, f(z)=1/2 again. So, the graph of f(sin(2πx)) would oscillate between 0 and 1/2, right?

Wait, wait, let me correct that. For z in [0, 1/2], f(z) = 1/2 - z, which decreases from 1/2 to 0 as z goes from 0 to 1/2.

For z in [1/2,1], f(z) = z -
