Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let's read it again carefully.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of these chips into a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, any extra chip placed would violate the above two conditions.

So, I'm trying to find the number of ways to do this placement.

Hmm. Let me unpack this a bit. So, each row can either be all white, all black, or have some chips but only one color. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says each cell can have at most one chip. But the conditions are about the same color in a row or column. So, if I have some cells in a row with chips, all those chips must be the same color. Similarly for columns.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: The condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, they all must be the same color, either all white or all black. Similarly for columns.

But wait, the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So, any row that has chips, all chips in that row must be same color. Same for any column that has chips; all chips in that column must be same color.

Additionally, the placement is such that adding any more chip would violate these conditions.

So, the grid has some cells occupied, each row of occupied cells must be a single color, each column of occupied cells must be a single color.

Moreover, the placement is maximal, meaning no more chips can be added without violating the conditions.

So, to rephrase, we have a 5x5 grid, each cell can have 0 or 1 chips. Each row that has at least one chip must have all its chips of the same color. Similarly, each column that has at least one chip must have all its chips of the same color. Also, the placement is such that no more chips can be added without violating these conditions.

We need to count the number of such placements, considering that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but since they are indist
