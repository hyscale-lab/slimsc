Okay, so I've got this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p+q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let me understand the problem. We have a set of rectangular boxes, each with surface area 54 and volume 23. The question is about the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. So, the sphere must be big enough to fit the largest possible box from this set. But wait, the boxes might have different dimensions, so I need to find the maximum possible distance from the center of the sphere to any corner of the box. That distance will be the radius of the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere has to contain each box, regardless of its dimensions. So the sphere must be large enough to contain the box with the maximum space diagonal. Because the space diagonal is the longest straight line inside the box, stretching from one corner to the opposite corner. So the radius of the sphere would be half of that space diagonal. Makes sense.

So, my approach should be: for a box with surface area 54 and volume 23, find the maximum possible space diagonal, then take half of that as the radius. Then, compute r squared, which would be (space diagonal squared)/4. So, first, I need to express the space diagonal in terms of the box's dimensions and then use the given surface area and volume to find the maximum possible space diagonal.

Let me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. So, surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and volume is xyz = 23.

The space diagonal D of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, D² = x² + y² + z².

I need to maximize D², given the constraints of surface area and volume. Once I find the maximum D², then r = D/2, so r² = D² /4.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² with the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, okay. Let's write down the constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

I remember that for variables with fixed product and symmetric sums, the expression x² + y² + z² can be related to the squares of the variables. Maybe I can use some inequalities or Lagrange multipliers here.

Wait, let's think about Lagrange multipliers. We can set this up as an optimization problem with two constraints. So, we need to maximize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², subject to constraints g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express x² + y² + z² in terms of the known quantities. Let's recall that:

(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz)

We know xy + yz + xz = 27, so:

(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2*27 = x² + y² + z² + 54

So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 54.

Therefore, if I can find x + y + z, I can find x² + y² + z². But how? I have the product xyz = 23.

Hmm
