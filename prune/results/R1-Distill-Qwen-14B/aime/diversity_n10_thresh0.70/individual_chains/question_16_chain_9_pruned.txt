Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that primes play a big role in number theory, especially with divisibility. So, the problem is about primes p where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². I think I need to find the smallest such prime p.

I remember that for primes, certain conditions have to be met for -1 to be a quartic residue modulo p. Wait, quartic residues are numbers that are fourth powers modulo p. So, for a prime p, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution. I wonder what conditions on p make this possible.

I know that for x² ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, p must be 1 mod 4. Because then -1 is a quadratic residue. But for quartic residues, I think the condition is similar but more specific. Maybe p must be 1 mod 8? Because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic with order p-1, so for x⁴ ≡ -1, -1 must be in the subgroup of fourth powers. So, the order of -1 must divide (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: if x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, then the multiplicative order of x modulo p must divide 8, because (x⁴)^2 ≡ 1 mod p. So, the order of x is 8, so 8 must divide the order of the multiplicative group, which is p-1. Therefore, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, the primes p where x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution are primes p ≡ 1 mod 8. So, the smallest primes are 17, 97, etc. Wait, but 2 is a prime. Does x⁴ ≡ -1 mod 2 have a solution? Let's see: mod 2, n⁴ is 0 or 1. Since -1 ≡1 mod 2, so n⁴ +1 is 0 or 2 mod 2. Wait, n can be 1: 1 +1=2 which is 0 mod 2. So, 2 divides n⁴ +1 when n is odd. But the problem says p² divides n⁴ +1. So, does 2² =4 divide n⁴ +1?

Let me check: If n is odd, n=1: 1 +1=2, which is 2 mod 4. So, 4 does not divide 2. If n is even, n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4. Not divisible by 4. So, n⁴ +1 is either 2 mod 4 or 1 mod 4. So, 4 never divides n⁴ +1, so p=2 is out. So the next candidate is p=17.

Wait, wait, but 17 is the first prime congruent to 1 mod 8. So, maybe p=17 is the least such prime.

But before I jump to conclusions, let me check if there are any smaller primes. The primes less than 17 are 2,3,5,7,11,13. Let's see if any of these have p² dividing n⁴ +1 for some n.

Starting with p=3: So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute possible n⁴ mod 9. The residues mod 9 are 0,1,2,4,5,7,8. Let's compute n⁴:

n=1: 1⁴=1 → 1 mod9
n=2: 16 →7 mod9
n=3: 81→0
n=4: 256 mod9. 256 /9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 →4 mod9
n=5: 625 mod9: 625-69*9=625-621=4 →4 mod9
n=6: 1296→0 mod9
n=7: 7⁴=49²=2401 mod9: 2401/9=266*9=2394, 2401-2394=7 →7 mod9
n=8: 8⁴=4096 mod9: 4096-455*9=4096-4095=1 →1 mod9

So, n⁴ mod9 can be 0,1,4,7. -1 mod9 is 8. So, 8 is not in the list. So there's no n with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5. Check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod25. Let's see. Maybe find if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡24 mod25.

First, compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24 (since mod25 cycles every 25). But that might take a while. Maybe there's a smarter way.

I remember that n^4 mod5 is either 0 or 1 because Fermat's little theorem says n^4 ≡1 mod5 if n not divisible by5. So, n^4 ≡0 or1 mod5. So, n^4 ≡-1 mod5 is n^4 ≡4 mod5. But n^4 can't be 4 mod5, so no solution mod5, which implies no solution mod25. So p=5 is out.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me check n=2: n^4=16 mod25. 16 ≡16, not 24. n=3: 81 mod25=6. n=7: 7^4=2401 mod25: 2401/25=96*25=2400, 2401-2400=1 →1 mod25. n=8: 8^4=4096 mod25: 4096 - 163*25=4096-4075=21. Not 24. n=12: 12^4=20736 mod25: 20736/25=829*25=20725, 2073
