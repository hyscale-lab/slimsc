Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing this. A convex equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length, and all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, since opposite sides are parallel, it's similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all angles equal. 

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF... So, if I imagine the hexagon, each side is a side of this triangle when extended. Wait, but in a regular hexagon, extending the sides might not form a triangle because they would all meet at points, but in this case, it does form a triangle. Interesting.

Let me denote the hexagon as ABCDEF, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA. Since it's equilateral, each side has the same length, say 's'. Also, AB is parallel to ED, BC is parallel to FE, and CD is parallel to AF. Wait, no, the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, in a hexagon, opposite sides would be AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA. So AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

Wait, now that I think about it,
