Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the torus T is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the main circle has radius 3, and the distance from its center to the axis of revolution is 6. That gives the torus its "donut" shape.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Conversely, when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties of tori and spheres.

First, a torus can be described in terms of two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

Let me think about how the torus and sphere can be tangent. When T is inside S, the closest point on T to the center of S must lie on the sphere's surface. Similarly, when T is outside S, the farthest point on T from the center of S must lie on the sphere's surface.

Wait, maybe that's the key. Let me model this mathematically.

Let's consider the centers. The sphere S has radius 11, so its center is at some point, say the origin (0,0,0) in 3D space for simplicity. The torus T is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, the major radius of the torus is R = 6, and the minor radius is r = 3.

When the torus is resting inside the sphere, it's tangent internally. That means the maximum distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus is equal to the sphere's radius. Similarly, when resting outside, the minimum distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus is equal to the sphere's radius.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If the torus is inside the sphere, the farthest point on the torus from the center of the sphere must be exactly at the sphere's surface. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center must be exactly at the sphere's surface.

Yes, that makes sense. So, for internal tangency, the maximum distance from the sphere's center to the torus is 11. For external tangency, the minimum distance is 11.

So, I need to compute the maximum and minimum distances from the sphere's center to the torus T, then set those equal to 11 and solve for the points of tangency.

Wait, but how do I compute the maximum and minimum distances from the sphere's center to the torus?

Let me model the torus mathematically. The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

But since the sphere is also centered at the origin, I can
