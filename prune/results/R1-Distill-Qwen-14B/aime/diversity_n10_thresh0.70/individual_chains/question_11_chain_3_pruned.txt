Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers, modulus, real parts... I remember some properties from my classes, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think step by step.

First, since |z| = 4, that means z is a complex number lying on the circle with radius 4 in the complex plane. So, z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might be useful because it parameterizes z in terms of a single variable θ, which I can then work with.

Wait, alternatively, I can write z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Maybe that's easier for substituting into the expression.

So the expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me compute each part separately.

Let me denote A = 75 + 117i and B = 96 + 144i. So the expression becomes Az + B/z.

Since |z| = 4, then 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|². Because for any complex number z, 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|². So 1/z = \overline{z}/16 since |z|² = 16. That might be helpful.

Wait, let me verify that. If z = a + ib, then 1/z = (a - ib)/(a² + b²). So yes, it's the conjugate divided by |z|². So since |z| is 4, |z|² is 16. Therefore, 1/z = \overline{z}/16. So B/z = B * \overline{z}/16.

So putting it together, the expression becomes Az + (B \overline{z})/16.

So maybe I can write this as (A z) + (B \overline{z})/16.

Hmm, let me compute each term. Let me write z as 4e^{iθ} = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). So \overline{z} is 4(cosθ - i sinθ).

So substitute z and \overline{z} into the expression.

First term: A z = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ).

Second term: (B \overline{z})/16 = (96 + 144i) * 4(cosθ - i sinθ) / 16. Let's compute that.

Wait, let's compute each term step by step.

First, compute A z:

A = 75 + 117i. Multiply by z = 4e
