Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis.

The problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other and intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola.

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, rhombus diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, I think that's correct. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Therefore, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is (x, y), then C should be (-x, -y) because the midpoint is the origin.

Similarly, points B and D should also be symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

So, we have four points: A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q). All these points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides should be equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.

Alternatively, since the sides are vectors, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should all have the same magnitude.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.

Wait, but we have the diagonals AC and BD. So, the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p.

Since diagonals are perpendicular, (y/x) * (q/p) = -1. So, yq = -xp.

So, that's one condition: yq = -xp.

Another thing is that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. Which we've already used because all four points are symmetric about the origin.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.

The hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, points on the hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbola functions. For hyperbola, a standard parametrization is x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, where a² = 20 and b² = 24.

So, a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6).

So, points A and C can be represented as (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ) and (-2√5 secθ, -2√6 tanθ), respectively.

Similarly, points B and D can be another pair, say, (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ) and (-2√5 secφ, -2√6 tanφ), respectively.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1. So, the slope of AC is (y_A - y_C)/(x_A - x_C) = (2√6 tanθ - (-2√6 tanθ))/(2√5 secθ - (-2√5 secθ)) = (4√6 tanθ)/(4√5 secθ) = (√6/√5) (tanθ/secθ) = (√6/√5) sinθ.

Similarly, the slope of BD is (√6/√5) sinφ.

Wait, but since the diagonals are AC and BD, their slopes must satisfy (slope_AC) * (slope_BD) = -1.

So, (√6/√5 sinθ) * (√6/√5 sinφ) = -1.

That simplifies to (6/5) sinθ sinφ = -1.

So, sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Hmm, that's one equation.

But maybe another approach is better. Since the slopes are perpendicular, their product is -1. So, if the slope of AC is m, then the slope of BD is -1/m.

Wait, but in terms of the parametrization:

Slope of AC: (√6/√5) sinθ.

So, slope of BD must be -√5/(√6 sinθ).

But slope of BD is (√6/√5) sinφ.

So, setting them equal:

(√6/√5) sinφ = -√5/(√6 sinθ).

Multiply both sides by √5/√6:

sinφ = -5/(6 sinθ).

So, sinφ = -5/(6 sinθ).

This gives a relationship between θ and φ.

But perhaps I can express point B in terms of θ, to enforce that.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to note that the four points form a rhombus, so the vectors AB and AD should have the same length.

Let me think in terms of vectors.

Let me denote vectors:

Vector AB = B - A = (p - x, q - y).

Vector AD = D - A = (-p - x, -q - y).

Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so |AB| = |BC| = |CD| = |DA|.

But perhaps that's getting too involved.

Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, and the diagonals are AC and BD.

So, the diagonals are AC: from A(x,y) to C(-x,-y), and BD: from B(p,q) to D(-p,-q).

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so AC is perpendicular to BD.

So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.

Vector AC is C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y).

Vector BD is D - B = (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q).

Wait, no. Actually, the vectors AC and BD are from the origin to the points, but the vectors representing the diagonals would be from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). However, the diagonals themselves as vectors are AC and BD, but for the purpose of perpendicularity, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.

Wait, no. The diagonals intersect at the origin, so the vectors from the origin are OA, OB, etc. But the diagonals are AC and BD, so the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q), respectively.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, the vectors of the diagonals are AC = C - A = (-2x, -2y) and BD = D - B = (-2p, -2q). So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero.

So, AC • BD = (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq = 0.

Divide both sides by 4: xp + yq = 0.

But earlier, I had from the slopes that yq = -xp, which is the same as xp + yq = 0. So, that's consistent. So, that's one equation.

Another condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola.

So, for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Similarly, for point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

So, we have:

1. xp + yq = 0.

2. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

3. p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

So, we have three equations.

Our goal is to find BD². Wait, BD is the diagonal, so BD is the distance between points B and D.

Points B(p, q) and D(-p, -q). So, BD is the distance from (p, q) to (-p, -q), which is sqrt[(p - (-p))² + (q - (-q))²] = sqrt[(2p)^2 + (2q)^2] = 2 sqrt(p² + q²).

So, BD² = [2 sqrt(p² + q²)]² = 4(p² + q²).

So, we need to find 4(p² + q²), but in terms of other variables or to find the maximum or minimum.

Wait, the problem says: "Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that is, find the supremum of BD², but the question is phrased a bit differently. Wait, no—it's the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, it's the infimum of BD²? Because it's the largest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, let me check. The problem says: "Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, for all rhombi, BD² is greater than some number, and we need the greatest such number. So, that would be the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD².

But wait, maybe BD² can be made arbitrarily small, but I doubt it because all points lie on the hyperbola.

Wait, the hyperbola has two branches on the left and right. So, points A, B, C, D could be on the same branch or on different branches.

But in a rhombus, the points should alternate between the two branches. Because if all points are on one branch, the rhombus might not close properly.

Wait, let me think. If the rhombus is centered at the origin, and the hyperbola is symmetric, then points A and C are on one branch, and points B and D are on the other. So, A and C are on, say, the right branch, and B and D are on the left branch. Or vice versa.

But considering that the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, which opens to the right and left.

So, points on the right branch have x ≥ sqrt(20), and points on the left branch have x ≤ -sqrt(20).

So, if A and C are on the right branch, then x is positive, and B and D are on the left branch, so p is negative.

Alternatively, both could be on the same branch, but since the rhombus is centered at the origin, I think it's more likely that they alternate branches.

Wait, but rhombus is a convex quadrilateral. So, if all four points are on the right branch, it's not possible because the rhombus would have to be on one side of the hyperbola. Similarly for the left. So, probably, points A and C are on one branch, and points B and D are on the other.

So, suppose A and C are on the right branch, so x is positive, and B and D are on the left branch, so p is negative.

But in our earlier equations, points A and C are (x, y) and (-x, -y), and points B and D are (p, q) and (-p, -q). So, if A is on the right branch, x is positive, so C is on the left branch. Similarly, if B is on the left branch, p is negative, so D is on the right branch.

Wait, that would mean that points A and D are on the right branch, and points B and C are on the left. Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's better not to assign specific branches but just consider that points A and C are reflections over the origin, as are B and D. So, if point A is on the right branch, point C is on the left, and if point B is on the right, point D is on the left.

But for the rhombus, the four points can't all be on the same branch, because then the figure would not be a convex quadrilateral. So, they must alternate between the two branches.

But regardless, perhaps we can proceed without worrying about the branches because the hyperbola is symmetric, and the equations will handle it.

So, going back to equations:

1. xp + yq = 0.

2. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

3. p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

We need to express BD², which is 4(p² + q²), in terms of these equations.

So, the idea is to find the minimum possible value of BD², because the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD².

Wait, but perhaps BD² can be minimized. Let's see.

From equation 1: xp + yq = 0.

Let me write that as xp = -yq.

From equation 2: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

From equation 3: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

We can perhaps express x and y in terms of p and q, or vice versa.

But let's think of using equations 2 and 3 to express x² and y², then plug into equation 1.

From equation 2: x² = 20(1 + y²/24).

Similarly, from equation 3: p² = 20(1 + q²/24).

Wait, no, equation 2 is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, so x² = 20(1 + y²/24).

Similarly, p² = 20(1 + q²/24).

So, x² = 20 + (20/24)y² = 20 + (5/6)y².

Similarly, p² = 20 + (5/6) q².

So, BD² = 4(p² + q²) = 4[20 + (5/6) q² + q²] = 4[20 + (11/6) q²].

Wait, wait, that doesn't look right. Wait, p² = 20 + (5/6) q²? No, wait, from equation 3: p² = 20 + (5/6) q² is correct.

So, p² + q² = [20 + (5/6) q²] + q² = 20 + (11/6) q².

So, BD² = 4*(20 + (11/6) q²) = 80 + (44/6) q² = 80 + (22/3) q².

So, BD² is a function of q². Since q² is non-negative, BD² is minimized when q² is as small as possible.

So, to find the minimum BD², we need the minimum possible q².

But we have equation 1: xp + yq = 0.

We can express y in terms of x and p, and q.

From equation 1: yq = -xp.

So, y = (-xp)/q.

But we can also express y from equation 2.

From equation 2: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, y² = 24(x²/20 - 1) = (24/20) x² - 24 = (6/5) x² - 24.

Similarly, from equation 3: q² = (24/20) p² - 24 = (6/5) p² - 24.

So, now, express y from equation 1: y = (-xp)/q.

Then, square both sides: y² = (x² p²)/(q²).

But from above, y² = (6/5)x² -24, and q² = (6/5) p² -24.

So, substituting:

(6/5 x² - 24) = (x² p²)/( (6/5 p² -24) )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

(6/5 x² -24)(6/5 p² -24) = x² p².

Let me denote u = x² and v = p² to make it easier.

So, equation becomes:

( (6/5) u -24 ) ( (6/5) v -24 ) = u v.

Expanding the left side:

(6/5 u)(6/5 v) + (6/5 u)(-24) + (-24)(6/5 v) + (-24)(-24) = u v.

So,

(36/25) u v - (144/5) u - (144/5) v + 576 = u v.

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

(36/25 u v - u v) - (144/5 u + 144/5 v) + 576 = 0.

Compute (36/25 - 1) u v = (11/25) u v.

So,

(11/25) u v - (144/5)(u + v) + 576 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate denominators:

11 u v - 720 (u + v) + 14400 = 0.

So, 11 u v -720 u -720 v +14400 =0.

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe we can factor it or find a substitution.

Let me rearrange:

11 u v -720 u -720 v = -14400.

Add 720²/11 to both sides? Wait, perhaps factor by grouping.

Alternatively, this is a quadratic in two variables.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as:

11 u v -720 u -720 v + (720^2)/(11) = -14400 + (720^2)/11.

Wait, that seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

11uv = 720(u + v) -14400.

Hmm.

But perhaps another approach is to express u in terms of v or vice versa.

Wait, let's see.

From equation 1: yq = -xp.

We have y² = (6/5)u -24, and q² = (6/5)v -24.

From y = (-xp)/q, squaring gives y² = (x² p²)/q².

So, (6/5) u -24 = (u v)/( (6/5 v -24) ).

So, (6/5 u -24)(6/5 v -24) = u v.

Which brings us back to the same equation as before.

Hm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can let k = u/v, to reduce variables.

Let me set k = u/v. Then, u = k v.

Substituting into the equation:

(6/5 u -24)(6/5 v -24) = u v.

So, (6/5 k v -24)(6/5 v -24) = k v * v.

Let me denote w = v.

So,

( (6/5 k w -24) ) ( (6/5 w -24) ) = k w².

Multiply out left side:

(6/5 k w)(6/5 w) + (6/5 k w)(-24) + (-24)(6/5 w) + (-24)(-24) = k w².

Compute each term:

First term: (36/25) k w².

Second term: - (144/5) k w.

Third term: - (144/5) w.

Fourth term: +576.

So,

36/25 k w² -144/5 k w -144/5 w +576 = k w².

Bring all terms to left:

36/25 k w² - k w² -144/5 k w -144/5 w +576 = 0.

Factor terms:

(36/25 k - k) w² + (-144/5 k -144/5) w + 576 = 0.

Compute coefficients:

36/25 k - 25/25 k = (11/25) k.

-144/5 (k + 1).

So, equation becomes:

(11/25)k w² - (144/5)(k +1) w + 576 =0.

Multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate denominators:

11 k w² - 720 (k +1) w + 14400 = 0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in w.

But this seems too complicated. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B in terms of angles on the hyperbola.

We can parametrize point A as (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ) and point B as (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ).

Then, since diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.

Slope of AC: as before, slope is (√6/√5) sinθ.

Slope of BD: (√6/√5) sinφ.

Their product is (√6/√5)^2 sinθ sinφ = (6/5) sinθ sinφ = -1.

So, sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

So, sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

So, this is a condition on θ and φ.

Additionally, in the rhombus, the distance from the origin to A and the distance from the origin to B must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, no, the rhombus is determined by the points A, B, C, D, so the vectors OA and OB must form adjacent sides of the rhombus.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the sides are equal in length and at an angle.

Wait, maybe to express the sides AB and AD in terms of vectors.

Vector AB = OB - OA = (2√5 secφ - 2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanφ - 2√6 tanθ).

Similarly, vector AD = OD - OA = (-2√5 secφ - 2√5 secθ, -2√6 tanφ - 2√6 tanθ).

Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, |AB| = |AD|.

Wait, but this might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.

So, given that, perhaps we can model the rhombus as having vertices at (a, b), (-a, -b), (c, d), (-c, -d), with the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular.

So, as before, the slopes of AC and BD are (b)/a and d/c, and their product is -1.

Wait, but for the points as (a,b), (-a,-b), (c,d), (-c,-d).

So, the slope of AC is (b - (-b))/(a - (-a)) = (2b)/(2a) = b/a.

Similarly, slope of BD is (d - (-d))/(c - (-c)) = (2d)/(2c) = d/c.

So, (b/a)(d/c) = -1.

So, (b d)/(a c) = -1.

Which implies b d = -a c.

So, that's our first condition.

Additionally, all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

So,

a²/20 - b²/24 =1,

c²/20 - d²/24 =1.

So, that's two more equations.

So, we have:

1. b d = - a c.

2. a²/20 - b²/24 =1.

3. c²/20 - d²/24 =1.

We need to find BD², which is the square of the distance between (c, d) and (-c, -d), which is sqrt[(2c)^2 + (2d)^2]^2 = 4(c² + d²).

So, BD² =4(c² + d²).

We need to find the infimum of BD² given the above constraints.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing BD² =4(c² + d²) given:

1. b d = - a c.

2. a²/20 - b²/24 =1.

3. c²/20 - d²/24 =1.

So, four variables a, b, c, d, but with these three equations.

So, perhaps we can express b and d in terms of a and c.

From equation 1: b d = -a c.

From equation 2: b² = (a²/20 -1)*24.

From equation 3: d² = (c²/20 -1)*24.

So, perhaps we can express b and d in terms of a and c.

Let me write b² = (a²/20 -1)*24.

Similarly, d² = (c²/20 -1)*24.

So, from equation 1: b d = -a c.

Let me square both sides: (b d)^2 = a² c².

But b² d² = ( (a²/20 -1)*24 ) * ( (c²/20 -1)*24 ).

So,

(24(a²/20 -1))(24(c²/20 -1)) = a² c².

So,

24² (a²/20 -1)(c²/20 -1) = a² c².

Let me compute 24² = 576.

So,

576 (a²/20 -1)(c²/20 -1) = a² c².

Let me write (a²/20 -1) = (a² -20)/20, and similarly for c².

So,

576 * [ (a² -20)/20 * (c² -20)/20 ] = a² c².

Multiply the terms:

576 * (a² -20)(c² -20) / (20*20) = a² c².

Simplify denominator: 20*20=400.

So,

(576 /400) (a² -20)(c² -20) = a² c².

Simplify 576/400: 576 ÷ 16 =36; 400 ÷16=25. So, 36/25.

So,

(36/25) (a² -20)(c² -20) = a² c².

Multiply both sides by 25:

36 (a² -20)(c² -20) =25 a² c².

Expand the left side:

36 [a² c² -20 a² -20 c² +400] =25 a² c².

So,

36 a² c² -720 a² -720 c² +14400 =25 a² c².

Bring all terms to left:

36 a² c² -25 a² c² -720 a² -720 c² +14400=0.

Simplify 36 a² c² -25 a² c² =11 a² c².

So,

11 a² c² -720 a² -720 c² +14400 =0.

Hmm, so 11 a² c² -720 a² -720 c² +14400 =0.

Let me factor this equation.

Perhaps factor by grouping.

Let me factor:

11 a² c² -720 a² -720 c² +14400.

Let me group terms as (11 a² c² -720 a²) + (-720 c² +14400).

Factor a² from first group: a²(11 c² -720).

Factor -720 from second group: -720(c² -20).

So,

a²(11 c² -720) -720(c² -20)=0.

Hmm, not immediately helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor terms:

11 a² c² -720 a² -720 c² = -14400.

Hmm.

Alternatively, we can let u = a² and v = c², then the equation becomes:

11 u v -720 u -720 v = -14400.

Which is similar to the earlier equation.

So, 11 u v -720 u -720 v = -14400.

We can write this as:

11 u v -720 u -720 v + (720^2)/(11) = -14400 + (720^2)/11.

Wait, perhaps completing the rectangle.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of u and v.

Let me think of this as:

11 u v -720 u -720 v = -14400.

Let me factor this as:

(11 u -720)(11 v -720) = (720)^2 -11*(-14400).

Wait, let me compute:

Let me write 11 u v -720 u -720 v = -14400.

Add 720^2 /11 to both sides:

11 u v -720 u -720 v + (720^2)/11 = -14400 + (720^2)/11.

Then, the left side can be written as (11u -720)(11v -720)/11.

Wait, let me check.

Let me consider (11u -720)(11v -720) = 121 u v - 720*11 u -720*11 v +720^2.

Which is different from the left side. So, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps rewrite the equation as:

11 u v =720(u +v) -14400.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps set u = v, but not sure if that's valid.

Assume u = v.

Then,

11 u² -720 u -720 u = -14400.

So,

11 u² -1440 u +14400=0.

Divide by 11:

u² - (1440/11) u + 14400/11=0.

Compute discriminant: (1440/11)^2 -4*(14400/11).

= (1440^2)/(11^2) - (57600)/11.

= (1440^2 - 57600 *11)/11^2.

Compute 1440^2: 1440*1440=2,073,600.

Compute 57600*11=633,600.

So, numerator: 2,073,600 -633,600=1,440,000.

So, sqrt(1,440,000)=1200.

So, u=(1440/11 ±1200)/2.

Wait, but this is getting too involved. Maybe u = v is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps we can let u = k v, as before.

Let me set u = k v, where k is a positive real number.

Then, equation becomes:

11 k v^2 -720 k v -720 v +14400=0.

Wait, perhaps better to express in terms of k.

Wait, no, the equation was 11 u v -720 u -720 v = -14400.

So, substituting u = k v,

11 k v^2 -720 k v -720 v = -14400.

Factor v:

v (11 k v -720 k -720) = -14400.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, express 11 u v =720(u +v) -14400.

Divide both sides by u v:

11 =720(1/v +1/u) -14400/(u v).

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of variables t = u + v and s = u v.

Then, the equation is 11 s -720(t) = -14400.

But without another equation, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of BD² =4(c² + d²).

From equation 3: c²/20 -d²/24 =1.

So, d² =24(c²/20 -1).

So, d²= (6/5)c² -24.

So, BD²=4(c² + d²)=4(c² + (6/5)c² -24)=4*(11/5 c² -24)= (44/5) c² -96.

So, BD² is a linear function of c². So, to minimize BD², we need to minimize c².

But c² is related to a² via the earlier equation.

Wait, but from the hyperbola equation, c² must be at least 20.

Because for hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24=1, x² ≥20.

So, c² ≥20, and similarly a² ≥20.

So, the minimal c² is 20, but does that correspond to a valid rhombus?

Wait, if c²=20, then from equation 3: d²= (6/5)*20 -24=24 -24=0.

So, d=0.

So, point B would be at (sqrt(20), 0), but wait, in our setup, point B is (c, d). If d=0, then it's on the x-axis.

But in that case, point D would be (-c, 0). So, points B and D would be (-sqrt(20),0) and (sqrt(20),0).

But then, the rhombus would have points A and C on the hyperbola, and points B and D on the x-axis.

But in that case, the rhombus would have points A, B, C, D with A and C on the hyperbola, B and D on the x-axis.

But let's check if this is a valid rhombus.

So, if c²=20, d=0.

Then, from equation 1: b d = -a c.

But d=0, so 0 = -a c => a c=0.

But a²=20, so a= sqrt(20) or -sqrt(20).

So, if a= sqrt(20), c= sqrt(20), then a c=20, which can't be zero.

Wait, contradiction. So, c² cannot be 20 because that would imply a c=0, but a and c are at least sqrt(20). Hence, c² must be greater than 20.

So, c²>20.

Therefore, BD²= (44/5)c² -96.

Since c²>20, BD²> (44/5)*20 -96= 176 -96=80.

So, BD²>80.

Wait, so the minimal BD² is greater than 80.

But can BD² approach 80?

If c² approaches 20 from above, then BD² approaches 80 from above.

Hence, the infimum of BD² is 80.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 80.

So, the answer is 80.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given hyperbola and the rhombus inscribed within it. The hyperbola equation is \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), and the rhombus \(ABCD\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular, and all vertices lie on the hyperbola.

1. **Parametrization of Points**: Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be parametrized using hyperbola functions. For point \(A\), we use \( (2\sqrt{5} \sec\theta, 2\sqrt{6} \tan\theta) \), and for point \(B\), \( (2\sqrt{5} \sec\phi, 2\sqrt{6} \tan\phi) \). The condition for perpendicular diagonals leads to \( \sin\theta \sin\phi = -\frac{5}{6} \).

2. **Distance Calculation**: The length of diagonal \(BD\) is calculated as \( BD = 2\sqrt{p^2 + q^2} \), where \(B\) is \((p, q)\). Thus, \(BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\).

3. **Hyperbola Constraints**: Using the hyperbola equations for points \(A\) and \(B\), we derive relationships between \(x\), \(y\), \(p\), and \(q\). We find that \(BD^2 = \frac{44}{5}c^2 - 96\), where \(c^2\) is related to the coordinates of point \(B\).

4. **Minimizing \(BD^2\)**: By analyzing the constraints, we determine that \(c^2\) must be greater than 20 due to the hyperbola's nature. As \(c^2\) approaches 20 from above, \(BD^2\) approaches 80 from above. Thus, the infimum of \(BD^2\) is 80.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{80}\).
