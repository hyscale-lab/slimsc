Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron ABCD, and I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each of the faces. The incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, right? That distance is what I'm looking for.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

Hmm, interesting. It looks like opposite edges are equal. So AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron is called "isohedral" or maybe "equifacial," but I'm not completely sure. Anyway, the key thing is that opposite edges are equal, which might imply some symmetry in the tetrahedron.

Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe this tetrahedron has some properties similar to a regular tetrahedron, but it's not regular because the edges are of different lengths. So, perhaps it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where the opposite edges are equal, making it easier to calculate volume and other properties.

I need to find the distance from the incenter to each face. I recall that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found by the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). But wait, is that correct? Let me think. In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In a tetrahedron, it's volume divided by something. Wait, maybe it's 3 times volume divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces. Yes, that sounds right because in 3D, the volume is related to the inradius and the surface area. So the formula is r = 3V / (sum of face areas).

So, my first step is to find the volume V of the tetrahedron. Second, I need to find the areas of each of the four triangular faces. Then, sum them up to get S. Then, compute r = 3V / S.

But how do I find the volume? Well, for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths, one way is to use the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember that the volume can be calculated using this determinant, which requires all the edge lengths.

The formula for the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger matrix for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is a 5x5 matrix:

| 0    1     1     1     1  |
| 1    0    a²    b²    c² |
| 1   a²    0     d²    e² |
| 1   b²   d²     0     f² |
| 1   c²   e²    f²     0  |

The determinant of this matrix is then used to compute the volume.

So, let me assign the given edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41) => a² = 41
AC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80) => b² = 80
AD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89) => c² = 89
BC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89) => d² = 89
BD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80) => e² = 80
CD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41) => f² = 41

So, the Cayley-Menger matrix CM is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me check. The second row is 1, 0, a², b², c², which is 1, 0, 41, 80, 89. Similarly, third row is 1, a², 0, d²,
