Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem to solve. Let me try to visualize it first. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD. The edges have these specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so opposite edges are equal. That probably means the tetrahedron has some symmetry.

The question is about finding the distance from a special point I inside the tetrahedron to each of the faces. All these distances are equal, so I think I is the incenter of the tetrahedron. Just like the incenter in a triangle, which is equidistant from all sides, the incenter in a tetrahedron is equidistant from all its faces.

So, the distance we're looking for is the inradius. I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the sum of the areas of the four faces.

Okay, so I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S. Then, I can compute r.

First, let's think about finding the volume. I recall that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths given, we can use the formula involving the determinant of a matrix if we know the coordinates. But since I don't have coordinates here, maybe there's another way.

Wait, since opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron might be isohedral, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where all edges are in pairs of equal lengths. Hmm, perhaps it can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me place point A at (a, b, c), but maybe a better approach is to choose a coordinate system where the centroid is at the origin, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another idea: Since opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is a "kite" tetrahedron, but I'm not exactly sure about the properties. Alternatively, maybe I can find the edge lengths and figure out the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Yes, that's a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

The Cayley-Menger determinant is given by:

288 * V^2 = determinant of the matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC²  0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD²  0  |

So, let me note down all the squared edge lengths since the formula requires them.

Given:
AB = sqrt(41) => AB² = 41
CD = sqrt(41) => CD² = 41

AC = sqrt(80)
