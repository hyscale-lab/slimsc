Okay, so I have this problem here that I need to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number, the largest one possible, such that if I change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, when I divide N by 1000, Q is the quotient (which would be the thousands digit, right?), and R is the remainder, which would be the last three digits. So, Q + R would be the thousands digit plus the last three digits, which is effectively the number formed by the last three digits plus the thousands digit. But I might be getting ahead of myself.

First, let's parse the problem step by step. We need to find the largest four-digit number N with a specific divisibility property when any single digit is replaced by 1. So, N is a four-digit number, say N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero.

The condition is: For each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones), if you change that digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q + R where Q is N divided by 1000 (so Q is A, the thousands digit) and R is the remainder (which is BCD, the last three digits). So Q + R is A + BCD.

But let's focus first on finding N.

I need to find the largest four-digit number N where each of the four numbers formed by replacing any single digit with 1 is divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the largest four-digit number, I should start by considering the largest possible four-digit number, which is 9999, and check if it satisfies the condition. If it does, we're done. If not, we'll need to check smaller numbers.

But 9999 is probably too big, and it's unlikely to satisfy the condition because replacing any digit with 1 would result in a number with several 9s, which might not be divisible by 7. Let me test that.

Wait, maybe I should first think about the structure of N. Let's denote N as ABCD, with digits A, B, C, D.

So, the four numbers we need to check are:

1. 1BCD: Changing A to 1.
2. A1CD: Changing B to 1.
3. AB1D: Changing C to 1.
4. ABC1: Changing D to 1.

Each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, mathematically, for N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D,

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D must be divisible by 7.
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, these four numbers must each be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let me write these out as congruences:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm. Perhaps I can compute what each of these expressions is modulo 7.

Let me compute the coefficients modulo 7 first because that might simplify the equations.

Compute 1000 mod 7: 1000 ÷ 7 is 142 * 7 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 /7 is 14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7: 10-7=3, so 10≡3 mod7.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite the four conditions with these modulo 7 equivalents.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7.

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So now, we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7. (Equation 1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7. (Equation 2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7. (Equation 3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7. (Equation 4)

So, these four equations must hold simultaneously for the digits A, B, C, D.

Our goal is to find the largest four-digit number N = ABCD, so A should be as large as possible (preferably 9), then B, C, D as large as possible.

So, perhaps we can approach this by starting with A=9 and trying to find B, C, D such that all four equations are satisfied.

Alternatively, we can try to solve these equations step by step.

Let me see if I can find some relationships between these equations.

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 4.

Equation 4: 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡0

Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0

Subtracting 1 from 4:

(6A + 2B + 3C +1) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡0 -0 mod7

Simplify:

6A -6 + 1 - D ≡0 mod7

Which is 6(A -1) + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

So,

6(A -1) + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

Hmm. Maybe that's not immediately helpful, but let's note that.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 4.

Equation 4: 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0

Equation 2: 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0

Subtracting 2 from 4:

(6A + 2B + 3C +1) - (6A +2 + 3C + D) ≡0 -0

Simplify:

2B -2 +1 - D ≡0 mod7

Which is 2(B - 0.5) - D +1 ≡0 mod7. Hmm, not too helpful.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's write all equations in terms of D, perhaps.

From Equation 1:

6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

So, D ≡ -6 -2B -3C mod7

Equation 2:

6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

So, D ≡ -6A -2 -3C mod7

Equation 3:

6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7

So, D ≡ -6A -2B -3 mod7

Equation 4:

6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7

So, 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7

Wait, but since from Equation 1, we have D ≡ (-6 -2B -3C) mod7, and from Equation 2, D ≡ (-6A -2 -3C) mod7, so let's set these equal:

-6 -2B -3C ≡ -6A -2 -3C mod7

Simplify:

-6 -2B ≡ -6A -2 mod7

Multiply both sides by -1:

6 + 2B ≡6A +2 mod7

Bring all terms to left:

6 + 2B -6A -2 ≡0 mod7

Simplify:

4 + 2B -6A ≡0 mod7

Factor:

2B -6A ≡ -4 mod7

Which is:

2B -6A ≡3 mod7 (since -4 mod7 is 3)

We can factor 2:

2(B - 3A) ≡3 mod7

Multiply both sides by 4 (the inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7):

B -3A ≡ 12 mod7

12 mod7 is 5, so:

B -3A ≡5 mod7

So, B ≡3A +5 mod7.

That's a useful relationship.

Similarly, let me try to find another relationship.

From Equation 1 and Equation 3, both express D in terms of other variables.

From Equation 1: D ≡ -6 -2B -3C mod7

From Equation 3: D ≡ -6A -2B -3 mod7

Set them equal:

-6 -2B -3C ≡ -6A -2B -3 mod7

Simplify:

-6 -3C ≡ -6A -3 mod7

Multiply both sides by -1:

6 +3C ≡6A +3 mod7

Bring 6 and 3 to the right:

3C -6A ≡3 -6 mod7

3C -6A ≡-3 mod7

Factor:

3(C - 2A) ≡4 mod7 (since -3 mod7=4)

Multiply both sides by 5 (since 3*5=15≡1 mod7):

C -2A ≡20 mod7

20 mod7 is 6, so C -2A ≡6 mod7

Thus, C ≡2A +6 mod7

So now, we have two relationships:

1. B ≡3A +5 mod7
2. C ≡2A +6 mod7

So, B and C are expressed in terms of A modulo7. Since A is a digit from 1 to9, perhaps we can find possible values.

Wait, but A is a digit (1-9). So, A can be from 1 to 9, but when we compute B and C, they must also be digits (0-9). So, B and C must satisfy 0 ≤ B,C ≤9.

So, perhaps for each possible A (from 9 down to 1, since we want the largest N), compute B and C modulo7, then determine possible digits for B and C.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of equations.

Let me summarize the equations:

From Equation 4:

6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7

But from Equation 1: D ≡ -6 -2B -3C mod7

And from Equation 4: 6A +2B +3C ≡ -1 mod7

So, let's plug D into Equation 4.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe plug the expressions for B and C in terms of A into Equation 4.

From earlier, we have:

B ≡3A +5 mod7 → B = (3A +5) mod7

Similarly, C ≡2A +6 mod7 → C = (2A +6) mod7

So, substituting these into Equation 4:

6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7

Let me substitute B and C:

6A + 2*(3A +5 mod7) + 3*(2A +6 mod7) ≡ -1 mod7

But since mod7 is a ring, I can compute each term modulo7.

Compute each term:

6A is as is.

2*(3A +5) =6A +10.

3*(2A +6)=6A +18.

So, sum all together:

6A + (6A +10) + (6A +18) ≡ -1 mod7

Add the coefficients:

6A +6A +6A =18A

10 +18=28

So, 18A +28 ≡ -1 mod7

Simplify 18A mod7: 18 mod7 =4, so 4A

28 mod7 =0

So, 4A +0 ≡ -1 mod7 → 4A ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7=6)

So, 4A ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod7. Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, inverse is 2.

So, A ≡6*2 mod7 → A≡12 mod7→A≡5 mod7.

So, A can be 5 or 12, but since A is a digit (1-9), possible A is 5 or 5+7=12, which is invalid. So, only A=5.

Wait, that's a problem because we're looking for the largest four-digit number, so A should ideally be 9, but according to this, A must be 5 mod7.

So, possible A values are 5, 12, 19, etc. But A is a digit from 1 to9, so only A=5.

But that contradicts our hope of having A=9.

Hmm. So perhaps my earlier steps are correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, so starting from Equation 4, substituting B and C expressions:

Equation 4: 6A +2B +3C ≡ -1 mod7

We have B =3A +5 mod7, C=2A +6 mod7.

So, 6A +2*(3A+5) +3*(2A+6) mod7.

Compute the coefficients:

6A + 6A +10 +6A +18.

So, 6A +6A +6A = 18A.

10 +18 =28.

18A mod7: 18/7=2*7=14, 18-14=4, so 18A ≡4A mod7.

28 mod7=0.

So, 4A +0 ≡-1 mod7 →4A ≡6 mod7.

So, 4A ≡6 mod7. Solving for A:

Multiplying both sides by 2: 8A ≡12 mod7.

But 8≡1 mod7, so 1*A ≡12 mod7→ A≡12 mod7→12-7=5→A≡5 mod7.

So, yes, correct. Therefore, A must be 5 mod7. So possible A's are 5 and 12, but since A is a digit (1-9), only A=5.

Wait, that's a problem because that would make N=5BCD, but we're looking for the largest N, which would be 9999, but according to this, A can only be 5.

Hmm, so perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

After subtracting Equation1 from Equation4, I got:

6(A-1) + (1-D) ≡0 mod7.

But maybe I made a mistake in subtraction.

Wait, Equation4:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7

Equation1:6 +2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7

So, subtracting 1 from 4:

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6 +2B +3C + D) = 6A -6 +1 - D

Which is 6(A-1) + (1-D).

So, correct.

So, 6(A-1) + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, that's correct.

Similarly, when I subtracted Equation2 from Equation4, I got:

2B -2 +1 - D ≡0 mod7.

Wait, let's check that again.

Equation4:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0

Equation2:6A +2 +3C + D ≡0

Subtracting 2 from4:

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6A +2 +3C + D) = 2B -2 +1 - D.

So, 2B -1 - D ≡0 mod7.

So, 2B - D ≡1 mod7.

Wait, so that's another equation: 2B - D ≡1 mod7.

So, now I have:

From earlier steps:

B ≡3A +5 mod7

C ≡2A +6 mod7

And from Equation4 minus Equation2:

2B - D ≡1 mod7.

So, perhaps I can use this to find D in terms of B.

So, D ≡2B -1 mod7.

But we also have from Equation1:

D ≡-6 -2B -3C mod7.

But since C ≡2A +6 mod7, substitute that into D:

D ≡-6 -2B -3*(2A +6) mod7.

Compute:

-6 -2B -6A -18.

Which is -6A -2B -24.

Mod7: -24 mod7 is (-24 +28)=4.

So, -6A -2B +4 ≡0 mod7.

Wait, no, D ≡-6 -2B -3C ≡-6 -2B -3*(2A +6) mod7.

So,

-6 -2B -6A -18.

Which is -6A -2B -24.

Mod7:

-24 mod7: 7*3=21, so -24 +28=4.

So, -6A -2B +4 ≡0 mod7.

But from Equation4 minus Equation2, we have D ≡2B -1 mod7.

Wait, but D is also equal to (-6A -2B -24) mod7, which is (-6A -2B +4) mod7.

So, D ≡ (-6A -2B +4) mod7.

But also, D ≡2B -1 mod7.

Therefore:

-6A -2B +4 ≡2B -1 mod7.

Bring all terms to left:

-6A -2B +4 -2B +1 ≡0 mod7

Simplify:

-6A -4B +5 ≡0 mod7

Multiply both sides by -1:

6A +4B -5 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A +4B ≡5 mod7.

But we have B ≡3A +5 mod7.

So, substitute B =3A +5 mod7 into this equation.

So,

6A +4*(3A +5) ≡5 mod7.

Compute:

6A +12A +20 ≡5 mod7.

12A mod7: 12-7=5→12≡5 mod7, so 12A=5A.

20 mod7: 20-14=6.

So, 6A +5A +6 ≡5 mod7.

11A +6 ≡5 mod7.

11 mod7=4, so 4A +6 ≡5 mod7.

Subtract 6: 4A ≡ -1 mod7 →4A≡6 mod7.

Which is the same as before, which leads to A≡5 mod7.

Hmm, so regardless of the approach, A must be 5 mod7.

So, A can be 5, 12, etc., but since A is a digit, only 5.

Wait, does this mean that the thousands digit A must be 5? But then N would be 5BCD, which is a four-digit number, but not the largest possible. So, perhaps my approach is correct, but maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should take a step back.

Let me consider that N is a four-digit number, so A can be from 1 to9. The condition is that changing any digit to 1 gives a number divisible by7.

We derived that A must be ≡5 mod7, so A can be 5 or 12 (but 12 is invalid). So A=5.

Therefore, N is 5BCD.

Now, knowing that, let's try to find B, C, D such that all four conditions are satisfied.

So, N=5BCD.

We have:

B ≡3A +5 mod7 → B ≡3*5 +5=15+5=20 mod7 →20 mod7=6, so B≡6 mod7.

So, B can be 6 or 6+7=13, but since B is a digit, 0≤B≤9, so B=6.

Similarly, C ≡2A +6 mod7 →2*5 +6=10+6=16 mod7→16-14=2, so C≡2 mod7.

So, C can be 2 or 2+7=9.

We need to choose the maximum possible digits for B, C, D to make N as large as possible.

Since B=6, that's the maximum possible for B because B=6, but wait, 6 is less than 9, so is there a way to have a higher B?

Wait, but according to the equation, B must be congruent to 6 mod7. So, B can be 6 or 13, but 13 is not a digit. So, B=6.

Similarly, C can be 2 or 9, since 2 mod7 and 9=2+7.

So, to maximize N, we should choose C=9.

So, C=9.

Now, let's find D.

From Equation1: D ≡-6 -2B -3C mod7.

Substituting B=6, C=9:

D ≡-6 -2*6 -3*9 mod7.

Compute:

-6 -12 -27 = -45.

-45 mod7: 7*6=42, so -45 +49=4.

So, D≡4 mod7.

So, D can be 4 or 11, but since D is a digit, only 4 is valid (11 is not a digit).

So, D=4.

Therefore, N=5 B C D =5 6 9 4 =5694.

Wait, but is this the largest possible four-digit number satisfying the condition? Because 5694 is a four-digit number, but perhaps there's a larger number where A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, but maybe we can have a higher D if possible.

Wait, D must be 4 mod7, so D can be 4 or 11, but 11 is invalid. So D=4 is the only possibility.

Wait, but let me check if N=5694 satisfies all four conditions.

Let me compute each modified number:

1. Changing A to1: 1694. Check if 1694 is divisible by7.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694, yes, it's divisible.

2. Changing B to1: 5194 ÷7.

Compute 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Yes, divisible.

3. Changing C to1: 5614 ÷7.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Yes.

4. Changing D to1: 5691 ÷7.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Yes.

So, all four numbers are divisible by7. So N=5694 is a valid number.

But wait, I thought A had to be 5, but maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because if A must be 5 mod7, then A could be 5 or 12, but 12 is not a digit, so only 5.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step where I concluded that A must be 5 mod7. Let me re-examine that.

Earlier, when I subtracted Equation1 from Equation4, I got 6(A-1) + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

But perhaps there's another way to approach this.

Wait, perhaps I should try starting with A=9 and see if any number N=9BCD satisfies the conditions. If yes, that would be better than A=5.

But according to earlier calculations, A must be 5 mod7, so A=5, 12, etc., but 12 is invalid. So, perhaps A=5 is indeed the only possibility.

Wait, but that can't be right because 9999 is a four-digit number, and perhaps there's a larger N with A=9 that satisfies the condition. Let me test that.

Wait, let's suppose A=9, then let's see if we can find B, C, D such that all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

So, for A=9, N=9BCD.

Then, the four modified numbers are:

1. 1BCD: 1000 + 100B +10C +D ≡0 mod7.

2. 91CD: 9000 + 100 +10C +D ≡0 mod7.

3. 9B1D: 9000 +100B +10 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. 9BC1: 9000 +100B +10C +1 ≡0 mod7.

But let's compute these mod7.

First, compute 1000 mod7: 6.

100 mod7:2.

10 mod7:3.

1 mod7:1.

So,

1. 1BCD ≡6 +2B +3C +D mod7 ≡0.

2. 91CD ≡(9000 mod7=6*9=54≡54-49=5; 100 mod7=2; so 5 +2 +3C +D) mod7 ≡0.

Wait, 91CD is 9000 +100 +10C +D.

9000 mod7: 9000 ÷7: 7*1285=8995, 9000-8995=5. So 9000≡5 mod7.

100≡2 mod7.

So, 91CD ≡5 +2 +3C +D mod7 ≡7 +3C +D mod7 → 0 +3C +D mod7.

So, 3C +D ≡0 mod7.

Similarly,

3. 9B1D: 9000 +100B +10 +D.

9000≡5, 100B≡2B, 10≡3, D≡D.

So, 5 +2B +3 +D ≡ (5+3) +2B +D ≡8 +2B +D mod7→8 mod7=1, so 1 +2B +D ≡0 mod7.

4. 9BC1: 9000 +100B +10C +1.

9000≡5, 100B≡2B, 10C≡3C, 1≡1.

So, 5 +2B +3C +1 ≡6 +2B +3C mod7 ≡0.

So, now, for A=9, we have the four conditions:

1. 6 +2B +3C +D ≡0 mod7.

2. 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. 1 +2B +D ≡0 mod7.

4. 6 +2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

Now, let's see if these can be satisfied.

From condition4: 6 +2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

From condition2: 3C + D ≡0 mod7 → D ≡-3C mod7.

From condition3: 1 +2B +D ≡0 mod7.

Substituting D from condition2 into condition3:

1 +2B -3C ≡0 mod7 →2B -3C ≡-1 mod7.

So, 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

From condition4: 6 +2B +3C ≡0 mod7 →2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

Now, we have two equations:

1. 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

2. 2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

Let me add these two equations:

(2B -3C) + (2B +3C) =4B ≡6 +1=7 mod7→4B ≡0 mod7.

So, 4B ≡0 mod7 →B≡0 mod7, since 4 and7 are coprime. So, B≡0 mod7.

Since B is a digit, B=0 or7.

But we're trying to maximize N=9BCD, so B should be as large as possible. So, B=7.

Now, substitute B=7 into equation from condition4:

2*7 +3C ≡1 mod7 →14 +3C ≡1 mod7.

14 mod7=0, so 0 +3C ≡1 mod7 →3C≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by 5 (inverse of3 mod7 is5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7):

C≡5 mod7.

So, C=5 or12, but since C is a digit, C=5.

Now, from condition2: D≡-3C mod7 →D≡-15 mod7→-15 mod7 is (-15 +21)=6→D≡6 mod7.

So, D=6 or13, but D is a digit, so D=6.

So, with A=9, B=7, C=5, D=6.

So, N=9756.

Now, let's check all four conditions:

1. Changing A to1: 1756. Is 1756 divisible by7?

1756 ÷7: 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6. Not divisible. So, 1756 mod7=6≠0.

So, this doesn't satisfy condition1. Therefore, our assumption that A=9 is possible is wrong.

Hmm, so perhaps A=9 is not allowed, which means our earlier conclusion that A must be5 mod7 is correct.

Wait, but when I tried A=9, I got a contradiction in condition1, which suggests that A=9 is invalid. Therefore, the maximum possible A is5.

So, N=5694.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations when A=9. Let me double-check.

Wait, when A=9, B=7, C=5, D=6.

So, condition1: 1000 +100B +10C +D =1000 +700 +50 +6=1756.

1756 ÷7=250.857..., which is not an integer. So, 1756 is not divisible by7, which means our N=9756 does not satisfy condition1.

Therefore, A cannot be9. So, the next possible A is5.

So, N=5694.

But wait, let me confirm that N=5694 is indeed the maximum possible.

Wait, is there a higher N with A=5, but higher digits in B, C, D?

Because 5694 is 5 6 9 4.

If we try to increase D, but D must be4 mod7. So, D can be4 or11, but 11 is invalid. So, D=4 is the only possibility.

Similarly, C must be2 mod7. So, C can be2 or9. We chose9 to maximize N.

B must be6 mod7, so B=6 or13→B=6.

So, 5694 is indeed the maximum possible with A=5.

But wait, perhaps there's a way to have a higher N with A=5, but with higher B, C, D.

Wait, but B=6 is the maximum possible since B must be6 mod7, and 6+7=13 is invalid.

Similarly, C=9 is the maximum since C=2 mod7, and 9 is the largest digit possible.

D=4 is the maximum allowed by D≡4 mod7.

So, N=5694 is the largest possible.

But let me check if there's a higher N with A=5, perhaps with higher digits in B, C, D beyond what we've found.

Wait, for example, if C is9, which is the maximum, and B=6, which is the maximum for B=6 mod7.

So, 5694 is the maximum N with A=5.

But let me think again: Is there a way to have a higher N with A=5, but with B=6, C=9, D=4, which is 5694.

Wait, but is 5694 the largest possible? Or is there a larger N where A=5, but B, C, D are higher?

Wait, but B can't be higher than6 because B=6 is the maximum for B=6 mod7.

Similarly, C can't be higher than9, and D can't be higher than4.

So, yes, 5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's another set of B, C, D with A=5 that gives a larger N.

Wait, for example, if C=9, B=6, D=4, that's 5694.

If I try to change D to 11, which is not possible, so D=4 is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps if C=2, D=11→invalid.

So, no, 5694 is the maximum N with A=5.

Therefore, N=5694.

Now, we need to compute Q and R when N is divided by1000.

Q is the quotient, which is the thousands digit, so Q=5.

R is the remainder, which is the last three digits, 694.

So, Q + R =5 +694=699.

Wait, but let me compute 5694 ÷1000.

5694 divided by1000 is5 with a remainder of694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Therefore, Q + R=5 +694=699.

But wait, before I conclude, let me make sure that N=5694 is indeed the correct number.

Let me check the four conditions:

1. Changing A to1: 1694 ÷7=242, which is exact.

2. Changing B to1:5194 ÷7=742, which is exact.

3. Changing C to1:5614 ÷7=802, exact.

4. Changing D to1:5691 ÷7=813, exact.

Yes, all four numbers are divisible by7. So, N=5694 is correct.

Therefore, the answer is Q + R=5 +694=699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Then, we compute \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define \( N \):**
   Let \( N = ABCD \) where \( A, B, C, D \) are digits, and \( A \neq 0 \).

2. **Conditions:**
   Changing any digit to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7:
   - \( 1BCD \) must be divisible by 7.
   - \( A1CD \) must be divisible by 7.
   - \( AB1D \) must be divisible by 7.
   - \( ABC1 \) must be divisible by 7.

3. **Modulo 7 Analysis:**
   Using modulo 7, we derive the following congruences:
   - \( 6 + 2B + 3C + D \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 6A + 2 + 3C + D \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 6A + 2B + 3 + D \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

4. **Solving Congruences:**
   By solving these congruences, we find:
   - \( A \equiv 5 \mod 7 \), so \( A = 5 \) (since \( A \) is a digit).
   - \( B \equiv 6 \mod 7 \), so \( B = 6 \).
   - \( C \equiv 2 \mod 7 \), so \( C = 9 \) (choosing the largest valid digit).
   - \( D \equiv 4 \mod 7 \), so \( D = 4 \).

5. **Form \( N \):**
   Thus, \( N = 5694 \).

6. **Compute \( Q \) and \( R \):**
   - \( Q = 5 \) (the thousands digit).
   - \( R = 694 \) (the last three digits).

7. **Sum \( Q + R \):**
   \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{699}
