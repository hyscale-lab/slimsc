Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. The goal is to figure out how many ways I can place digits in each cell so that two conditions are met. First, when I read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999. Second, when I read the numbers top to bottom, their sum is 99. The example given is a grid:

0 0 8
9 9 1

Which works because 0 + 991 = 999 and 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out how many such grids exist.

Let me try to model this. The grid has two rows and three columns. Let's label the cells as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the top row forms the number abc, which is a three-digit number: 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom row forms def: 100d + 10e + f.

Now, the first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed left to right is 999. So, (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

The second condition is that the sum of the numbers formed top to bottom is 99. So, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is ad, which is 10a + d. The second column is be, which is 10b + e. The third column is cf, which is 10c + f. So, the sum is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Alright, so now I have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, okay. Let me write these equations more clearly:

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I need to solve these two equations with variables a, b, c, d, e, f, each being digits (0-9). But I also need to consider that a and d can't be zero if they are the first digits of their respective numbers. Wait, no, actually, in the example given, a is 0 and d is 9, but 0 is allowed for a because it's part of a three-digit number, but actually, in the top row, if a is 0, the number becomes a two-digit number. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right." So, I think the numbers are three-digit numbers, meaning a and d cannot be zero because they are the first digits of three-digit numbers. Wait, but in the example, the top row is 0 0 8, which would be 008, which is 8, a single-digit number. But in the example, the sum is 0 + 991 = 991, which is 991, not 999. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, in the example, the top row is 0 0 8, which is 008, which is 8. The bottom row is 9 9 1, which is 991. 8 + 991 equals 999, that's correct. So, in this case, a is 0, which makes the top number 008, but it's treated as a three-digit number with leading zeros. So, a can be zero, even though it's the first digit of a three-digit number. So, a and d can be zero. So, all digits a, b, c, d, e, f can be from 0 to 9.

That's good to know because it means a and d can be zero, so I don't have to worry about them being non-zero. So, that simplifies things a bit.

So, now, let's write down the two equations:

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Let me reorganize the terms for clarity.

Equation 1 can be grouped as:
(100a + 100d) + (10b + 10e) + (c + f) = 999
Which is 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Equation 2 can be grouped as:
(10a + 10b + 10c) + (d + e + f) = 99
Which is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

So, Equation 1: 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
Equation 2: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Now, let me denote S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f
And T1 = a + b + c, T2 = d + e + f

So, Equation 1 becomes: 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999
Equation 2 becomes: 10 T1 + T2 = 99

Additionally, from the variables:

We have S1 = a + d, which is a sum of two digits, so S1 can be 0 to 18.

Similarly, S2 = b + e, which can be 0 to 18.

S3 = c + f, which can be 0 to 18.

T1 = a + b + c, which can be 0 to 27.

T2 = d + e + f, which can be 0 to 27.

But let's look at Equation 2: 10 T1 + T2 = 99.

Since 10 T1 + T2 = 99, we can write T2 = 99 - 10 T1.

But T2 must be a non-negative integer because it's the sum of three digits (d, e, f). So, 99 - 10 T1 must be ≥ 0.

So, 10 T1 ≤ 99 => T1 ≤ 9.9, but since T1 is an integer, T1 ≤ 9.

But T1 is the sum of three digits, each 0-9, so T1 can be 0 to 27. But here, T1 must be ≤9.

So, T1 can be 0,1,2,...,9.

Similarly, T2 = 99 - 10 T1. So, since T2 is the sum of three digits, it must be between 0 and 27.

Let me calculate T2 for T1 from 0 to 9.

T1: 0 → T2=99 → which is impossible because T2 can be at most 27.

So, that's not possible.

T1: 1 → T2=89 → also impossible.

T1:2 → T2=79 → nope.

T1:3 → T2=69 → nope.

T1:4 → T2=59 → nope.

T1:5 → T2=49 → nope.

T1:6 → T2=39 → nope.

T1:7 → T2=29 → nope.

T1:8 → T2=19 → still higher than 27? No, wait, 19 is less than 27. Hmm, so T1=8, T2=19. But 19 is possible because 19 ≤27.

Similarly, T1=9 → T2=9.

Wait, wait. Wait, 10 T1 + T2 = 99.

If T1=9, then T2=99 - 90=9. So, T2=9.

But T2 is the sum d+e+f=9. That's possible.

Similarly, T1=8: T2=19. But wait, d+e+f=19. That's possible because each of d, e, f can be up to 9, but 9+9+1=19, for example.

But wait, T2 must be ≤27, which it is in both cases (19 and 9). So, the possible T1 values are 8 and 9.

Wait, let me check:

- When T1=8: T2=99 - 80=19. 19 is ≤27, so valid.
- When T1=9: T2=99-90=9. 9 is ≤27, so valid.

What about T1=7: T2=29, which is greater than 27, so invalid.

Similarly, T1=6: T2=39 → invalid. So, only T1=8 and T1=9 are possible.

So, Equation 2 gives us two possibilities:

Case 1: T1=8, T2=19
Case 2: T1=9, T2=9

So, now, I can analyze each case separately.

Let's first handle Equation 1: 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3 = 999.

We need to find S1, S2, S3 such that this equation holds. Since S1, S2, S3 are sums of two digits each, they can range from 0 to 18.

But 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3 =999.

So, 100 S1 must be less than or equal to 999. So, S1 can be at most 9, since 100*10=1000 which is more than 999.

So, S1 can be 0 to 9.

But also, 100 S1 must be such that 100 S1 ≤999 → S1 ≤9, as above.

So, we can express 999 as 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3.

So, 999 divided by 100 is 9 with remainder 99.

So, 999 = 100*9 + 99.

But 99 can be broken into 10*9 + 9 → 10 S2 + S3 =99.

Wait, but 10 S2 + S3 =99.

But S2 and S3 are sums of two digits, so maximum S2=18, S3=18.

Wait, 10 S2 + S3 =99.

So, 10 S2 ≤99 → S2 ≤9.9 → S2 ≤9.

Because S2 is an integer, so S2=9.

Then, 10*9=90, so S3=9.

So, S3=9.

Therefore, 10 S2 + S3 =99 only if S2=9 and S3=9.

So, that gives us Equation 1's solution: S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Because 100*9 +10*9 +9=900+90+9=999.

So, Equation 1 can only be satisfied by S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Wait, is that the only possibility? Let me double-check.

Suppose S1=8, then 100*8=800. Then, 10 S2 + S3=199. But 10 S2 + S3 can be at most 10*18 +18=198. 199 is just above that, so no solution when S1=8.

Similarly, S1=9 is the only possible value because 100*9=900, leaving 99 for the other two terms.

So, Equation 1 gives S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, now, we have S1= a + d=9,

S2= b + e=9,

S3= c + f=9.

So, each pair (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) must sum to 9.

Now, let's move to Equation 2, which as we found, has two cases: T1=8, T2=19 and T1=9, T2=9.

But T1= a + b + c=8 or 9, and T2= d + e + f=19 or9.

But wait, since we know S1= a + d=9, S2= b + e=9, S3= c + f=9.

So, a + d=9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9.

And T1= a + b + c=8 or9,

T2= d + e + f=19 or9.

We can express T1 and T2 in terms of these:

T1= a + b + c.

But from the column sums:

We have:

From the first column, top to bottom: a + d =9,

Second column: b + e=9,

Third column: c + f=9.

So, T1= a + b + c.

But from the first row, the sum a + b + c is T1, and from the second row, d + e + f=T2.

But d=9 - a,

e=9 - b,

f=9 - c.

So, substituting, T2= d + e + f = (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - T1.

So, T2=27 - T1.

But from Equation 2, we had T2=99 -10 T1.

So, combining these two expressions for T2,

27 - T1 = 99 -10 T1

Let me solve this equation:

27 - T1 = 99 -10 T1

Adding 10 T1 to both sides:

27 +9 T1 =99

Subtract 27:

9 T1=72

So, T1=8.

So, T1=8, which gives T2=27 -8=19.

So, that's only one possible case, because earlier when analyzing Equation 2, we considered T1=8 and T1=9. But based on this equation, T1 must be 8 because that's the only solution.

So, that means the only possible case is T1=8, T2=19.

So, now, T1= a + b + c=8,

T2= d + e + f=19.

But since d=9 - a, e=9 - b, f=9 - c,

T2= (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c)=27 - (a + b + c)=27 - T1=27 -8=19, which is consistent.

So, now, the problem reduces to finding all possible digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0-9) such that:

a + d=9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9,

a + b + c=8,

and d + e + f=19.

But since d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c,

We can substitute d, e, f in terms of a, b, c.

So, T2= (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c)=27 - (a + b + c)=19,

Which implies that a + b + c=8.

So, now, our variables are a, b, c, each from 0-9, such that:

a + b + c=8,

a + d=9 → d=9 -a,

b + e=9 → e=9 -b,

c + f=9 → f=9 -c.

So, our problem now is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions (a, b, c) where each variable is between 0 and 9, inclusive, and:

a + b + c=8.

But also, since d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c, we need to ensure that d, e, f are digits (i.e., 0-9).

So, since a, b, c are digits, 0 ≤a, b, c ≤9.

So, d=9 -a must satisfy 0 ≤d ≤9. Which implies that 9 -a ≥0 → a ≤9, which is already satisfied since a is a digit. And 9 -a ≤9 → a ≥0, which is also satisfied.

Same for e and f: since b and c are digits, e=9 -b and f=9 -c are also digits.

Therefore, the only constraint is a + b + c=8, with a, b, c ≥0 integers.

So, how many non-negative integer solutions are there to a + b + c=8, where each variable is between 0 and 9 inclusive.

Well, since 8 is less than or equal to 9, and each variable is at least 0, the maximum any variable can be is 8, which is less than 9, so the upper limit is automatically satisfied. So, the number of solutions is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8.

The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 +x2 +x3= n is C(n +3 -1, 3 -1) = C(n+2, 2). So, for n=8, it's C(10, 2)=45.

But wait, but each variable can be at most 9, but as 8 is less than 9, no variable can exceed the upper limit, so all solutions are valid.

So, there are 45 possible (a,b,c) triplets where a + b + c=8, with each a, b, c ≥0.

But wait, hold on. Each a, b, c is a digit (0-9), so each can be 0 to 9. Since 8 is less than 9, no variable can exceed 9. So, all solutions are valid.

So, the number of triplets is 45.

Therefore, for each such triplet, the digits d, e, f are uniquely determined as d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

So, each (a, b, c) triplet corresponds to exactly one grid.

But wait, I need to ensure that all digits d, e, f are digits (0-9). Since a, b, c are digits, d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c will also be digits because a, b, c can be 0-9, so d, e, f will be 9 down to 0.

So, each of the 45 triplets (a, b, c) gives a valid grid.

Wait, but let me verify with the example given.

In the example:

a=0, b=0, c=8.

So, a + b + c=0 +0 +8=8, which satisfies the condition.

d=9 -a=9, e=9 -b=9, f=9 -c=1.

So, the grid is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

Which matches the example. So, that's correct.

So, if I have 45 such triplets, each leading to a unique grid, then the total number of grids is 45.

But wait, I should confirm if all these triplets indeed satisfy the constraints.

Each a, b, c is a digit (0-9), and their sum is 8. So, each can be 0-8.

Wait, but no, because for example, a could be 8, then b and c would be 0. But a, b, c can be 0-9, but their sum is 8, so none can be more than 8. So, each a, b, c is 0-8, but in digits, 0-9, so it's okay.

Wait, but wait a second. When a, for example, is 9, then d=0. But in the sum a + b + c=8, a cannot be 9 because that would require b + c= -1, which is impossible. So, a, b, c can only be 0-8 in this scenario.

So, the possible digits for a, b, c are 0-8, since a + b + c=8.

So, each of a, b, c is between 0 and 8, inclusive.

Thus, the number of solutions is indeed 45.

Therefore, the number of grids is 45.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me think again.

Each grid is determined by choosing a, b, c such that a + b + c=8, and then setting d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

But in the grid, a is the top-left digit, b is top-middle, c is top-right, d is bottom-left, e is bottom-middle, f is bottom-right.

Each of a, b, c can be 0-8, as their sum is 8.

Therefore, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of solutions of a + b + c=8 in non-negative integers, which is 45.

Hence, the answer is 45.

Wait, but let me see if there are any constraints I'm missing.

Is there any possibility that d, e, or f could be negative? No, because a, b, c are non-negative, so d=9 -a ≥0, same for e and f.

Also, since a, b, c ≤8, d, e, f ≥1 (since 9 -8=1). So, d, e, f are in 1-9.

Wait, no. If a is 9, which is not possible here because a + b + c=8. So, a can be at most 8, which would make d=1.

Wait, no. If a=0, d=9.

If a=1, d=8.

a=2, d=7.

a=3, d=6.

a=4, d=5.

a=5, d=4.

a=6, d=3.

a=7, d=2.

a=8, d=1.

So, d ranges from 1 to9.

Similarly, e and f will range from 9 down to 1, depending on b and c.

So, all digits d, e, f are valid (1-9), which is fine because digits can be 0-9, but they just can't be negative.

So, no issues there.

Therefore, all 45 triplets (a, b, c) lead to valid grids where all digits are between 0 and9.

Hence, the number of such grids is 45.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Since a, b, c are digits, each can be 0-9, but their sum is 8.

So, for each of a, b, c, the maximum they can be is 8, because if any is 9, the sum of the other two would have to be -1, which is impossible.

So, all a, b, c must be between 0-8, which is within the digit range.

Therefore, all 45 triplets are valid, leading to 45 grids.

Thus, the number of ways is 45.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions and equations systematically. The grid has two rows and three columns, with digits placed such that:

1. The sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.
2. The sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

Let the grid be:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Formulate Equations
From the first condition:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999 \tag{1}
\]
From the second condition:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99 \tag{2}
\]

### Step 2: Analyze Equation (2)
Let \( T_1 = a + b + c \) and \( T_2 = d + e + f \). Then:
\[
10T_1 + T_2 = 99
\]
Since \( T_2 = 99 - 10T_1 \), and \( T_2 \) must be a sum of three digits (0-9), \( T_2 \leq 27 \). Thus:
\[
99 - 10T_1 \leq 27 \implies T_1 \geq 7.2 \implies T_1 \geq 8
\]
Also, \( T_1 \leq 9 \) because \( 10T_1 \leq 99 \). Therefore, \( T_1 = 8 \) or \( T_1 = 9 \).

- If \( T_1 = 8 \), then \( T_2 = 19 \).
- If \( T_1 = 9 \), then \( T_2 = 9 \).

### Step 3: Analyze Equation (1)
Let \( S_1 = a + d \), \( S_2 = b + e \), and \( S_3 = c + f \). Then:
\[
100S_1 + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999
\]
Since \( 100S_1 \leq 999 \), \( S_1 \leq 9 \). Testing \( S_1 = 9 \):
\[
100(9) + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999 \implies 10S_2 + S_3 = 99
\]
Given \( S_2 \) and \( S_3 \) are sums of two digits (0-18), the only solution is \( S_2 = 9 \) and \( S_3 = 9 \).

Thus, \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = 9 \), meaning:
\[
a + d = 9, \quad b + e = 9, \quad c + f = 9
\]

### Step 4: Combine Results
From \( T_1 = a + b + c = 8 \) and \( T_2 = d + e + f = 19 \), substituting \( d = 9 - a \), \( e = 9 - b \), \( f = 9 - c \):
\[
T_2 = (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - (a + b + c) = 27 - T_1
\]
Substituting \( T_1 = 8 \):
\[
T_2 = 27 - 8 = 19
\]
Thus, \( T_1 = 8 \) is valid, and \( T_1 = 9 \) is invalid because it would make \( T_2 = 9 \), which conflicts with \( T_2 = 27 - T_1 \).

### Step 5: Count Valid Solutions
We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( a + b + c = 8 \), where \( a, b, c \) are digits (0-9). The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars formula:
\[
\binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
\]
Each solution corresponds to a unique grid, as \( d, e, f \) are determined by \( d = 9 - a \), \( e = 9 - b \), \( f = 9 - c \).

### Final Answer
The number of valid grids is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
