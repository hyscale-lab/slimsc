Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what's being asked. I need nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that their sum is 300, and another equation involving their squares and products is 6,000,000. Since all variables are nonnegative, I can consider the cases where some of them might be zero as well.

Let me write down the two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a way to relate it to the sum a + b + c.

Wait, maybe I can factor out some terms. Let's see:

Looking at the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

I can factor each pair:

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that seems useful. Since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as 300 - a, (a + c) as 300 - b, and (a + b) as 300 - c. Let me substitute these into the equation.

So, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that down:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a sum of terms each involving a variable cubed. Let me rearrange the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a way to express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of the sum a + b + c.

I know that a + b + c = 300, so perhaps I can find a relationship between a² + b² + c² and the sum. Also, maybe I can use the identity for a³ + b³ + c³.

Wait, there's an identity that relates a³ + b³ + c³ to a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, and abc. Let me recall:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, if I can find ab + bc + ca and abc, maybe I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of known quantities.

But do I know ab + bc + ca? Not directly. Let me think. Maybe I can find a² + b² + c² first.

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, from a + b + c = 300, we have:
