Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a tetrahedron. Hmm, tetrahedrons are like 3D shapes with four triangular faces. The problem gives me the lengths of the edges, and I need to find a point inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all the faces. That point is called the incenter, right? And the distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, the question is asking for this inradius.

Let me read the problem again to make sure I have all the details. It says that tetrahedron ABCD has AB and CD each equal to sqrt(41), AC and BD equal to sqrt(80), and BC and AD equal to sqrt(89). So, all the opposite edges are equal. Interesting, so it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron. Maybe it's a isohedral tetrahedron or something? I'm not too sure, but the symmetry might help.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

inradius = 3 * (volume) / (sum of the areas of the faces)

So, I'll need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of each of its faces.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me any specific coordinates for the vertices, so I'll have to figure out a way to compute the volume and the face areas without knowing the exact positions. Maybe I can use some properties of the edges?

Wait, all opposite edges are equal. AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. That seems like a special kind of tetrahedron. Maybe it's a "bi-orthocentric" tetrahedron? Or perhaps it's a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. I think such a tetrahedron is called "equifacial" or maybe "isosceles" tetrahedron. I might need to look up properties of such tetrahedrons, but since I can't access the internet, I'll have to think about it.

I recall that in a tetrahedron where all opposite edges are equal, the volume can be calculated using a formula involving the lengths of the edges. Let me try to recall that. I think the formula is something like:

Volume = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 72

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe that's for a triangle? No, wait, in 3D, the formula must be more complicated.

Another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box. I think that's a trick for such symmetric tetrahedrons. Let me try to imagine this.

If I place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system such that the edges correspond to the space diagonals of a rectangular box. Then, the lengths of the edges can be related to the sides of the box.

Suppose the edges of the box are a, b, c. Then, the space diagonals would be sqrt(a² + b² + c²). But in our case, the edges are in pairs with lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, but each pair of opposite edges has the same length, so maybe each space diagonal corresponds to a different pair.

Wait, but no. In a rectangular box, the space diagonals are all equal because they are sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So that's not the case here. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the tetrahedron can be split into two congruent triangles or something? Let me think.

Wait, another idea: in such a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron is "equilic," meaning all its faces are congruent triangles. But wait, the face areas might not necessarily be congruent because the edge lengths aren't the same for all. Let me check: the edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), sqrt(89). So, opposite edges are equal, but each face is a triangle with different edge combinations. For example, face ABC has edges AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD has edges AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), and AD = sqrt(89). So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all faces are congruent! So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). That's interesting. So, all faces are congruent, which might mean the tetrahedron is regular in some way, but not necessarily regular because the edges are different.

Wait, a regular tetrahedron has all edges equal, but in this case, edges are in pairs. So, it's not regular, but it's isohedral, meaning all faces are congruent. So, perhaps the volume and face areas can be calculated using properties of these congruent triangles.

But let's get back to the inradius formula. I need to find the volume and the total surface area (sum of all face areas). Then inradius is 3V / A_total.

So, first step: compute the area of each face. Since all faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), each face has the same area. So, I can compute the area once and multiply by four.

To find the area of a triangle given the three sides, I can use Heron's formula. So, let me compute the semi-perimeter first.

Wait, wait, what are the side lengths of each face? Let me see. Each face is a triangle with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89). Hmm, but let me calculate those numerically to make it easier.

sqrt(41) is approximately 6.4031, sqrt(80) is approximately 8.9443, and sqrt(89) is approximately 9.433.

But I'll keep them as exact values for calculation.

So, for Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

Wait, but Heron's formula might get messy with these square roots. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute the area.

Alternatively, another formula for the area of a triangle when all three sides are known is:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

Wait, that's the same as Heron's formula, just written differently.

So, plugging in a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89):

Compute each term:

First, a + b + c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

Second, -a + b + c = (-sqrt
