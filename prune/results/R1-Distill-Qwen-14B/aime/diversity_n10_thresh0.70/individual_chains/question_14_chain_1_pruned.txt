Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's try to make sense of it step by step. The problem is about finding the greatest four-digit number, N, with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once we find N, we need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

First, let me break down the problem. I need to find the largest four-digit number N = ABCD (where A, B, C, D are its digits) such that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for example, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, we can start by considering the largest four-digit number, which is 9999, and check whether it satisfies this condition. But 9999 might not satisfy the condition because changing some digit to 1 might not result in a number divisible by 7. So, we'll have to find the largest N by possibly decrementing from 9999 until we find one that meets the condition.

But testing each number one by one would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Let me think about the conditions each number must satisfy.

Each of the four modified numbers must be divisible by 7. That means:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Let me denote N as 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

When we change the first digit A to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, changing the second digit B to 1 gives 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Changing the third digit C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Changing the fourth digit D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, we have four congruence conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But since N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, let's denote N as such. Then, each modified number can be written as N - (digit place)*original_digit + (digit place)*1. For example, changing A to 1: N - (1000*A) + 1000*1 = N - 1000*(A - 1). Similarly for others.

But perhaps it's easier to express each condition in terms of N.

Let me compute N mod 7 for each case.

1. When A is changed to 1: The new number is N - (A*1000) + 1000. So, (N - (A-1)*1000) mod 7 = 0. So, N ≡ (A - 1)*1000 mod 7.

But wait, more accurately, the modified number is (N - A*1000 + 1*1000) ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N + (1000 - A*1000) ≡ 0 mod 7. Wait, no: Let's think again.

The modified number is 1BCD, which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) - 1000A + 1000 = N - 1000A + 1000. So, N - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N ≡ 1000A - 1000 mod 7.

But 1000 mod 7: Let me compute 1000 divided by 7. 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7. Therefore, 1000A ≡ 6A mod 7, and 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

So, the first condition is N ≡ 6A - 6 mod 7.

Similarly, the second condition is when changing B to 1. The new number is A1CD = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. So, N - 100B + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N ≡ 100B - 100 mod 7.

Compute 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7. So, 100B ≡ 2B mod 7. Therefore, N ≡ 2B - 2 mod 7.

Third condition: changing C to 1. The new number is AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. So, N - 10C + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N ≡ 10C - 10 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, so 10C ≡ 3C mod 7. So, N ≡ 3C - 3 mod 7.

Fourth condition: changing D to 1. The new number is ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. So, N - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N ≡ D - 1 mod 7.

So, summarizing the four conditions:

1. N ≡ 6A - 6 mod 7
2. N ≡ 2B - 2 mod 7
3. N ≡ 3C - 3 mod 7
4. N ≡ D - 1 mod 7

Since all four congruences must hold, all four expressions must be equal mod 7. Therefore:

6A - 6 ≡ 2B - 2 ≡ 3C - 3 ≡ D - 1 mod 7.

Let me write this as:

6A - 6
