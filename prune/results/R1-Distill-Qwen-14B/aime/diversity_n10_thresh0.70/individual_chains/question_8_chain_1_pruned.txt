Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let's try to break it down.

First, I know that when dealing with equations involving sums and products of variables, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric expressions or factor things in a clever way. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated, but maybe I can factor it somehow.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, let's see. I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. So it's like each variable squared multiplied by the other two. Maybe I can factor this expression.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express this in terms of symmetric sums. Let's denote S = a + b + c = 300. Then, maybe we can find expressions for ab + bc + ca and abc.

Wait, let me think. The given equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, this can be written as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substituting these into the equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's an interesting form. Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Now, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed using the formula:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Since a + b + c = 300, let's denote S = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

Substituting back into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [S³ - 3SQ + 3P] = 6,000,000.

But we also know that a² + b² + c² can be expressed in terms of S and Q.

We have a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S² - 2Q.

So, substitute that into the equation:

300(S² - 2Q) - S³ + 3SQ - 3P = 6,000,000.

Let me plug in S = 300:

300*(300² - 2Q) - 300³ + 3*300*Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Compute each term step by step.

First, compute 300*(300² - 2Q). 300² is 90,000. So 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Next, -300³ is -27,000,000.

Then, 3*300*Q is 900Q.

And finally, -3P.

Putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify term by term.

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600Q + 900Q = 300Q.

So, 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now we have an equation relating Q and P.

But we also have S = 300, which is a + b + c = 300.

We can think of this as a system in variables a, b, c, with Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Maybe we can find another relation or perhaps find possible integer solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the initial equation in terms of variables being equal or something.

Wait, maybe I should consider cases where two variables are equal?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider using generating functions or some combinatorial approach, but that might be complicated.

Wait, let's think about the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But we also know that for non
