Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to process it step by step. The problem says:

Let ABC be a triangle inscribed in circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, AD intersects ω at P. Given that AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10, I need to find AP and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm. First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize everything. But since there's already an Asymptote figure provided, I can imagine it: triangle ABC with the circumcircle ω, tangents at B and C meeting at D, and then line AD intersecting ω again at P.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, in this case, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, we have DB = DC.

That makes triangle DBC an isosceles triangle with DB = DC. So, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. But I'm not sure yet how that helps.

I think I need to find some properties or use some theorems related to circles, tangents, and intersecting chords. Maybe power of a point? The power of point D with respect to ω.

Power of a point D: since D lies outside the circle, the power is equal to DB² = DC² = DP * DA, where DP is the length from D to P and DA is from D to A.

Wait, hold on. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² (since DB is the tangent from D to ω). Also, since AD intersects ω at A and P, the power of D is equal to DA * DP. So, that gives us DB² = DA * DP.

So, DB² = DA * DP.

I can write this as DP = DB² / DA.

But I don't know DA yet. So maybe I need to find DA first.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Perhaps using Ceva's theorem or Menelaus', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, coordinate geometry? That might be tedious but could work.

Wait, let me think about triangle ABC first. We know all the sides: AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. So perhaps I can compute some angles or other lengths in triangle ABC first.

Let me compute the semiperimeter, s, to find the area using Heron's formula.

s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, area = sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[12*7*6] = sqrt[504]. Let me compute this: 504 factors into 16 * 31.5, wait,
