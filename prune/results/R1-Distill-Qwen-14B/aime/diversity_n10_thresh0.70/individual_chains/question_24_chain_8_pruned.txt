Okay, I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

So, there's a list of positive integers with three main properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And the question is asking for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Hmm, okay. Let's unpack this.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. It's unique here, so 9 is the only number that appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's a bit tricky because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list. So, I need to make sure that for the median to not appear, the list must have an even number of elements because then the median is the average of two middle numbers. But wait, the average could be an integer even if both middle numbers are integers. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median would be 9, which is an integer not in the list if 9 isn't present. Oh, but wait, 9 is the mode, so it must be in the list. Hmm, this seems conflicting.

Wait a second. Let me think. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If that average is an integer, but neither of the two middle numbers is that integer, then that integer is the median and doesn't appear in the list. But in our case, the mode is 9, so 9 must appear at least twice. So, can the two middle numbers add up to 18, making the median 9, but neither of the middle numbers is 9?

That could be possible. For example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is the median, and 9 is the mode (appearing more than any other number). So, in that case, the list could have 8 and 10 as the two middle numbers, and 9 appears multiple times elsewhere.

Alternatively, the list could have an odd number of elements. Wait, but then the median would be the middle element, which is an integer and must appear in the list. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, that's impossible if the number of elements is odd because the median would be one of the elements in the list. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Because only then the median could be the average of two middle numbers, which might not be
