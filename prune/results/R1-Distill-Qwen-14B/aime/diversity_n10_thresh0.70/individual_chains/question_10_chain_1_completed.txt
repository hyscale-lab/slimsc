Okay, so I have this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. And it's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. So Alice picks a set A, which is some collection of positive integers. Bob then considers all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum number in B is an element of A. The total number of such sets B is 2024, and from that, we have to figure out what A is, specifically the sum of its elements.

I think the key here is to figure out how the number of such sets B relates to the set A. So, for each element a in A, how many sets B have a as their maximum? Because if I can figure that out, I can sum over all a in A the number of such sets, and that should give me the total number of sets Bob has, which is 2024.

Let me think. If A has an element a, then any set B where the maximum is a must consist of a and any combination of elements from the numbers less than a. So, for a given a, the number of possible B's with maximum a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, since each subset corresponds to the elements less than a that can be included in B along with a.

Wait, but since B has to be non-empty, and the maximum is a, the subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} can be any subset, including the empty set, because when you add a, the set becomes {a}, which is non-empty. So the number of sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Because each element from 1 to a-1 can be either included or excluded, that's 2 choices for each, so 2^{a-1} total subsets.

So, if A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. So, the total number is 2^{a1 - 1} + 2^{a2 -1} + ... + 2^{an -1} = 2024.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} over all a in A is equal to 2024. Then, we need to find the sum of the elements a in A.

Okay, now I need to figure out which set A satisfies sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024. And then compute the sum of elements in A.

Hmm, 2^{a-1} is a power of two for each a in A. So, the sum is a sum of distinct powers of two. But wait, is that necessarily the case? Because if A has duplicate elements, but wait, A is a set, so all elements are unique. So, all 2^{a-1} terms are distinct because a's are unique.

Wait, but actually, 2^{a-1} could be the same for different a's if a-1's are equal, but since a's are unique, a-1's are unique, so each term is a distinct power of two. So, the sum of these terms is equal to 2024, which is a specific number. But 2024 can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of two. Hmm, let me check what 2024 in binary is.

Wait, 2024 divided by 2: 2024 / 2 = 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2 = 506, rem 0

506 /2 =253, rem 0

253 /2=126 rem 1

126 /2=63 rem 0

63 /2=31 rem1

31 /2=15 rem1

15/2=7 rem1

7/2=3 rem1

3/2=1 rem1

1/2=0 rem1

So writing the binary from last to first: 11111101000.

Wait, let me count: 2^0:1, 2^1:2, 2^2:4, 2^3:8, 2^4:16, 2^5:32, 2^6:64, 2^7:128, 2^8:256, 2^9:512, 2^10:1024, 2^11:2048.

Wait, 2^10 is 1024.

So 2024 is 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 0? Wait, let me do the binary correctly.

Wait, in binary, 2024 is 11111101000.

Let me count the number of bits. Let's see:

2^0 is the rightmost bit.

2024 in binary:

Let me compute 2^10 is 1024, subtract that from 2024: 2024 -1024=1000.

2^9 is 512: 1000-512=488.

2^8 is 256:488-256=232.

2^7 is128:232-128=104.

2^6 is64:104-64=40.

2^5 is32:40-32=8.

2^3 is8:8-8=0.

So the binary representation is 11111101000.

So that's 11 bits. So the exponents where the bits are set are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Wait, let's see:

From right to left, the bits are:

Starting from 2^0:

Bit positions: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Bits:           1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

Wait, maybe I got the positions reversed. Let me think again.

Wait, the rightmost bit is 2^0, then 2^1, up to 2^10.

So the binary 11111101000 is:

Positions 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Bits:          1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

So the 1s are at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Wait, so exponents where 2^k is part of the sum are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Wait, but in our problem, the sum is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So each term is 2^{a-1}. So each exponent here in 2024's binary representation is one less than an element of A.

So, for each 2^{k} in the binary representation, we have an a in A such that a-1 =k, so a=k+1.

So in our case, the exponents where 2^k appears in 2024 are k=10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So the corresponding a's are k+1: 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, because for each 2^{k}, a =k+1.

So A is {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}.

So the elements of A are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Now, the sum of elements in A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that.

4+6=10, 10+7=17, 17+8=25, 25+9=34, 34+10=44, 44+11=55.

So the sum is 55.

Wait, let me double-check the addition step by step.

4 +6 is 10.

10 +7 is 17.

17 +8 is 25.

25 +9 is 34.

34 +10 is 44.

44 +11 is 55. Yeah, that's correct.

So the sum of the elements of A is 55.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binary representation.

2024 divided by 2:

2024 /2=1012 rem 0

1012/2=506 rem0

506/2=253 rem0

253/2=126 rem1

126/2=63 rem0

63/2=31 rem1

31/2=15 rem1

15/2=7 rem1

7/2=3 rem1

3/2=1 rem1

1/2=0 rem1

So writing it as remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0.

So the binary is 11111101000, which is 11 bits. So that's 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Yes, so exponents 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So a's are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Hence, sum of a's is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4.

Wait, 11+10=21, +9=30, +8=38, +7=45, +6=51, +4=55. Yeah, same as before.

So I think that's correct.

So the answer is 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). Given that Bob's list has 2024 sets, we need to determine the sum of the elements of \( A \).

For each \( a \in A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum \( a \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). Therefore, the total number of such sets \( B \) is the sum \( \sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024 \).

The number 2024 in binary is \( 11111101000 \), which corresponds to the sum of powers of two:
\[
2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 = 2024
\]
Each term \( 2^k \) in this sum corresponds to an element \( a = k + 1 \) in \( A \). Thus, \( A = \{11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4\} \).

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55
\]

\boxed{55}
