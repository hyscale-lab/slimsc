Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC, and they mention it has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. I know that the circumcenter is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, which has a radius of 13 here. The incenter, on the other hand, is the intersection of the angle bisectors and is the center of the inscribed circle, with a radius of 6.

The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line segment connecting the incenter I and the circumcenter O. That seems like an important piece of information.

The question asks for the product AB times AC. So, I need to find AB multiplied by AC in this triangle.

Let me recall some important formulas related to triangle centers and their properties. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me plug in the given values here. So, R is 13 and r is 6.

Calculating OI²: 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*1 =13. So, OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but in the problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, that must relate to another property or perhaps a right triangle somewhere.

Let me think. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, triangle IOA is right-angled, with right angle at I.

In triangle IOA, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. So, OA² = IO² + IA².

I know OA is the circumradius, so OA is 13. IO we calculated as sqrt(13). So, OA² = 13² = 169.

So, 169 = (sqrt(13))² + IA² = 13 + IA². Therefore, IA² = 169 -13 = 156. So, IA is sqrt(156), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(39).

Okay, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). Now, I need to find AB * AC. Hmm, how can I relate this?

I remember that in a triangle, the length of the angle bisector can be related to the sides, but IA is the inradius? Wait, no, IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A, not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, which is 6.

Wait, so IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A. There's a formula for that. Let me recall. The distance from the incenter to a vertex can be found using the formula:

IA = (r) / sin(A/2)

Wait, is that correct? Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. The inradius r is related to the distances from the incenter to the sides, but the distance from the incenter to the vertex is a different measure.

Wait, perhaps I can express IA in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by:

IA = \sqrt{r^2 + \left( \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 }

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)}

Yes, that sounds familiar. Let me check. In a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex is equal to r divided by sin(A/2). So, if I can find angle A, I can relate IA to r and angle A.
