Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the problem defines a b-eautiful number as a positive integer n that satisfies two conditions when expressed in base b. It must have exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits must equal the square root of n. Hmm, okay.

Let me break this down. If n is a two-digit number in base b, then in base 10, n can be expressed as a*b + c, where a and c are the two digits in base b. Importantly, since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1 (because leading zeros aren't allowed), and both a and c must be less than b. So, a can range from 1 to b-1, and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, which is a + c, equals the square root of n. So, mathematically, that gives us the equation:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But since n is a*b + c, substituting that in, we get:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find a way to express it in terms that are easier to handle. Let's see.

I can rewrite the equation as:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. For each base b, I can consider c as a variable and see for which values of c this equation has integer solutions for a.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the equation differently. Let me think.

From the equation (a + c)^2 = a*b + c, perhaps I can express it as:

(a + c)^2 - c = a*b

So, (a + c)^2 - c must be divisible by a, which gives:

[(a + c)^2 - c] / a = b

Which simplifies to:

[(a^2 + 2ac + c^2) - c] / a = b

Breaking it down:

(a^2)/a + (2ac)/a + (c^2 - c)/a = b

Simplify each term:

a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a = b

Hmm, that's an interesting expression. So, for a given b, we have:

b = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

Since a and c are integers, (c² - c) must be divisible by a for this expression to result in an integer b. So, a must be a divisor of (c² - c).

But wait, a is also a digit in base b, so a can be from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1. So, for each base b, we can iterate over possible c values and see for which c, (c² - c) is divisible by some a in 1 to b-1, and then compute b as per the above equation.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of this equation as:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me denote s = a + c, so s = sqrt(n). Then, n = s². So, n must be a perfect square. That's a crucial point. So, for each base b, we need to find two-digit numbers in base b that are perfect squares and whose digits sum to their square roots.

Wait, that's another way to look at it. So, n is a perfect square, and n = a*b + c, with a and c digits in base b (so a < b, c < b). Also, a + c = sqrt(n).

So, maybe I can approach this by considering possible values of s (the square root), and then for each s, try to find pairs (a, c) such that a + c = s, and
