Okay, let me try to figure out this probability problem. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, P(A|B) is the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize.

Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers correct, which is a subset of winning a prize (which requires at least two correct), the intersection A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B), then divide them.

First, let's figure out how many possible ways there are for the lottery. The total number of possible combinations when choosing 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). Let me compute that: 10 choose 4 is 210.

So, the total number of possible outcomes is 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since Jen has picked 4 specific numbers, there's only 1 way that all four are chosen. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. To compute this, maybe it's easier to calculate the complementary probability and subtract from 1. The complementary event is that fewer than two numbers are chosen, i.e., zero or one number is chosen from Jen's numbers.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero correct) - P(one correct).

Let me compute P(zero correct) first. This is the probability that none of Jen's four numbers are chosen. So, the lottery chooses 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4). Let me compute that: 15. So, P(zero correct) = 15 / 210.

Then, P(one correct) is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen. To compute this, we choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 from the other 6. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3). Let's compute that: 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, P(one correct) = 80 / 210.

So, P(B) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210) = 1 - (95/210) = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210. Wait, let me check that: 15 + 80 is 95, so 210 - 95 is 115. So, 115/210.

Simplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. Therefore, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my computation. So, P(B) is 1 - P(zero) - P(one). P(zero) is C(6,4)/C(10,4) = 15/210. P(one) is C(4,1)*C(6,3)/C(10,4) = 4*20=80, so 80/210. 15 + 80 is indeed 95, so 1 - 95/210 is 115/210. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210. Therefore, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems low, but let's see. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, another approach: the number of favorable outcomes for event B is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers that include at least two of Jen's numbers. So, the number of such combinations is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0). Let me compute that.

C(4,2)*C(6,2) is 6 * 15 = 90.

C(4,3)*C(6,1) is 4 * 6 =24.

C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

So total is 90 +24 +1=115. So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115, which matches the earlier computation. So, the probability is 115/210.

Similarly, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, so P(A) is 1/210.

Therefore, P(A|B)=1/115. So, m=1, n=115. Are they coprime? Yes, because 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 is coprime with any number. So, m + n is 1 + 115=116.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 1/115 seems like a very low probability. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: when given that she won a prize (i.e., at least two correct), what's the probability she has all four correct. Intuitively, it's the number of grand prize combinations (which is 1) divided by the number of prize combinations (which is 115). So, yes, 1/115. So, the probability is 1/115, so m is 1, n is 115, m + n is 116.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of ways.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's 4 numbers picked from S, and Jen picks 4 numbers. So, when 4 numbers are chosen, the probability that all four match is 1/C(10,4)=1/210. The probability that at least two match is 115/210. So, the conditional probability is 1/115. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the grand prize is when all four are chosen, and a prize is when at least two are chosen. So, the conditional probability is correct as 1/115.

Another sanity check: the number of ways to have at least two correct is 115, so the probability is 115/210=23/42. Then, the probability of all four correct is 1/210. So, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210)*(42/23)= (42)/(210*23)= (1)/(5*23)=1/115.

So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 1 + 115=116.


Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, calculate the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

Next, compute the probability of winning the grand prize, \( P(A) \). Since there's only one way to win the grand prize (all four numbers must match), we have:
\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

Now, compute the probability of winning a prize, \( P(B) \), which is the probability of having at least two correct numbers. Calculate the complementary probability of having fewer than two correct numbers (i.e., zero or one correct number):
\[
P(\text{zero correct}) = \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210}
\]
\[
P(\text{one correct}) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \times 20}{210} = \frac{80}{210}
\]
\[
P(B) = 1 - P(\text{zero correct}) - P(\text{one correct}) = 1 - \frac{15}{210} - \frac{80}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Thus, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), and \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
