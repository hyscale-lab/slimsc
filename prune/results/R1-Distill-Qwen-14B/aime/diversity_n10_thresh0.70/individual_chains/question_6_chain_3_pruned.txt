Alright, so I have this problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions involved are a bit complicated, but I'll try to break them down step by step. Let me write down what I know.

First, the functions are defined as:
- \( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{4}| \)

And the two graphs whose intersections we're looking for are:
1. \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

So, essentially, we're dealing with parametric equations where both x and y are defined in terms of each other through these nested functions. Hmm, this might get a bit tangled, but let's take it slowly.

First, I think I should understand what the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) look like. They are both transformations of the absolute value function, which usually has a V-shape. Let's plot them mentally.

Starting with \( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \). The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, any negative part will be flipped. So, |x| - 1/2 will have parts where it's negative when |x| < 1/2. So, the graph of \( |x| - 1/2 \) is a V-shape with the vertex at (0, -1/2). Taking the absolute value of that, we get a W-shape, I believe. The points where |x| - 1/2 = 0 are at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So, \( f(x) \) will have minima at these points.

Similarly, \( g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| \) is similar but with a smaller shift. The inner function |x| - 1/4 has its vertex at (0, -1/4). Taking the absolute value, the graph will also form a W-shape, but with minima at x = 1/4 and x = -1/4.

So, both f and g are V-shaped after their transformations. Now, when we compose these functions, like f(sin(2πx)) and then apply g to that, it's going to create some periodicity because of the sine and cosine functions.

Let me think about the composition. Let's first consider f(sin(2πx)). The function sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k. Here, k is 2π, so period is 2π/(2π) = 1. So, sin(2πx) is a sine wave that completes a full cycle from 0 to 1 in x.

Similarly, cos(3πy) in the other equation has a period of 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So, its period is shorter, 2/3.

So, the functions inside g(f(...)) are periodic, which means that the entire composition will have periodic behavior as well. Therefore, the graphs of y and x are going to be periodic, which suggests that their intersections could be periodic as well.

But I'm not here to graph them, but rather to find the number of intersections. So, perhaps I can find a way to parameterize or find bounds on x and y, then determine how many times these two parametric equations cross each other.

Alternatively, maybe I can express y in terms of x and then substitute into the equation for x, but that seems complicated because both x and y are functions of each other.

Wait, another approach: since both equations are defined in terms of each other, perhaps I can set up a system where y is a function of x, and x is a function of y, and then find solutions where x and y satisfy both equations.

But looking at the equations:

1. \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

So, if I denote Equation 1 as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), and Equation 2 as x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), then perhaps we can think of this as a system where each variable is a function of the other.

So, to find the intersection points, we can set up the system:

\( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)

\( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

So, considering this as a system, we can try to find all pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations. Since both x and y are defined in terms of each other, it's a bit circular, but maybe we can find a relationship or find the possible values x and y can take.

First, let's try to understand the range of the functions involved. Let's see:

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Since |x| is always non-negative, |x| - 1/2 can be negative or non-negative. The absolute value ensures that the output is always non-negative. The maximum value of |x| is unbounded, so f(x) can be as large as |x| + 1/2, but in reality, since we're taking sine and cosine functions later, the input to f and g will be limited.

Wait, let me think. In the first function, f is applied to sin(2πx). Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, the input to f is between -1 and 1. Similarly, in the second function, cos(3πy) is between -1 and 1, so the input to f is between -1 and 1 as well.

So, f(sin(2πx)) will process sin(2πx) which is between -1 and 1.

Let me compute f(z) where z is in [-1, 1]. So, z can be any value from -1 to 1.

So, f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|.

Compute this for z in [-1, 1]:

Case 1: |z| ≥ 1/2. Then, |z| - 1/2 is ≥ 0, so the absolute value doesn't change it. So, f(z) = |z| - 1/2.

Case 2: |z| < 1/2. Then, |z| - 1/2 is negative, so the absolute value makes it 1/2 - |z|.

So, f(z) is:

- For |z| ≥ 1/2, f(z) = |z| - 1/2.
- For |z| < 1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - |z|.

So, f(z) is a V-shaped function with minima at z = ±1/2, where f(z) = 0, and maximum at z=0, where f(z)=1/2.

Wait, wait. So, f(z) is a function that reaches its minimum at z=±1/2 (where it's 0) and maximum at z=0 (where it's 1/2). So, the output of f(z) is in [0, 1/2].

Similarly, g(z) is defined as ||z| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this for z in [-1,1] as well.

g(z) = ||z| - 1/4|.

Again, similar to f(z), let's break it down.

Case 1: |z| ≥ 1/4. Then, |z| - 1/4 is non-negative, so g(z) = |z| - 1/4.

Case 2: |z| < 1/4. Then, |z| - 1/4 is negative, so g(z) = 1/4 - |z|.

So, g(z) is a V-shaped function with minima at |z|=1/4 (g(z)=0) and maxima at z=0 (g(z)=1/4). So, the output of g(z) is in [0, 1/4].

Wait, but the f(z) output is in [0, 1/2]. So, when we compute g(f(z)), the input to g is in [0, 1/2]. So, for the function g(w), where w is in [0, 1/2], let's see:

g(w) = ||w| - 1/4|. But since w is non-negative (as it's |z| - 1/2 or similar), |w| is just w.

So, g(w) = |w - 1/4|.

Which is another V-shape. It will have:

- For w ≥ 1/4: g(w) = w - 1/4.
- For w < 1/4: g(w) = 1/4 - w.

Thus, g(w) as a function of w in [0, 1/2] is:

- From w=0 to w=1/4: decreasing from 1/4 to 0.
- From w=1/4 to w=1/2: increasing from 0 to 1/4.

So, the maximum value of g(w) is 1/4, and the minimum is 0.

So, 4g(w) will scale this up by 4, making the range of 4g(w) [0, 1].

So, putting it all together:

For the first equation:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

Since sin(2πx) is in [-1,1], f(sin(2πx)) is in [0, 1/2]. Then, g(f(...)) is in [0, 1/4], so 4g(...) is in [0,1].

Similarly, in the second equation:

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

cos(3πy) is in [-1,1], so f(cos(3πy)) is in [0, 1/2], then g(f(...)) is in [0, 1/4], so 4g(...) is in [0,1].

Therefore, both x and y are confined to [0,1]. So, any intersection point (x,y) must lie within the unit square [0,1]×[0,1].

That's a useful constraint. Now, within this square, we need to find all (x,y) such that:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

Given the periodicity of sine and cosine, maybe we can consider their behavior over intervals.

But before that, perhaps it's useful to understand the behavior of these functions over [0
