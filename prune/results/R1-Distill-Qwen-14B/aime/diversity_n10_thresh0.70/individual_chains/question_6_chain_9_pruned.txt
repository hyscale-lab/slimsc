Okay, so I have this problem to solve where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations given are a bit complicated, so I need to break them down step by step.

First, let's understand the functions involved. The problem defines two functions, f(x) and g(x):

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Hmm, these are absolute value functions, and they involve nested absolute values. I remember that absolute value functions can create V-shapes or other piecewise linear graphs. The double absolute values might complicate things a bit, but maybe I can sketch them out or figure out their key points.

Let me start by analyzing f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. To graph this, I should consider different cases based on the value of x.

The inner absolute value |x| is straightforward—it’s a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 from it gives |x| - 1/2. Depending on whether |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2 or less than 1/2, the expression inside the outer absolute value will change.

So, |x| - 1/2 is positive when |x| >= 1/2, and negative when |x| < 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that would flip the negative part to positive.

Let me write this out:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
= {
  |x| - 1/2, if |x| >= 1/2
  1/2 - |x|, if |x| < 1/2
}

So, the graph of f(x) would be a V-shape that’s inverted between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, and then it’s a V-shape again outside that interval. Essentially, it creates a "W" shape? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, when |x| is >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So for x >= 1/2, f(x) = x - 1/2; for x <= -1/2, f(x) = -x -1/2. That would make two lines with slopes 1 and -1, starting from (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0) respectively.

But when |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. So for x between -1/2 and 1/2, it's a V-shape that peaks at (0, 1/2). So the whole function f(x) looks like a diamond shape with vertices at (-1/2, 0), (0, 1/2), and (1/2, 0), and then continues as lines with slope 1 and -1 beyond that. So it's a combination of two Vs: a small V in the middle and larger Vs on the sides.

Similarly, let's analyze g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Breaking this down:

g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|
= {
  |x| - 1/4, if |x| >= 1/4
  1/4 - |x|, if |x| < 1/4
}

So, the graph of g(x) will also have a similar structure. For |x| >= 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4, which is linear with slopes 1 and -1 starting at (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0). In between, for |x| < 1/4, it's 1/4 - |x|, which is a V-shape peaking at (0, 1/4). So g(x) looks like a smaller diamond compared to f(x), with vertices at (-1/4, 0), (0, 1/4), and (1/4, 0), and then lines beyond that.

Now, the functions we're dealing with in the problem are:

y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, both equations involve compositions of f and g, applied to sine and cosine functions, scaled by 4. Also, the first equation is y as a function of x, while the second is x as a function of y, which suggests that the second equation is the inverse function or something similar.

But wait, actually, the second equation is x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))), which is a bit tricky because it's x in terms of y. So, it's not a function in the traditional sense, but more like an implicit equation relating x and y.

To find the number of intersections between these two graphs, we need to find all pairs (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied. That is, y must equal 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))), and x must equal 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))).

Since both equations involve similar structures, perhaps we can find a relationship or symmetry between x and y.

Alternatively, maybe we can parameterize one variable and substitute into the other equation. Let me try to see.

First, let's try to understand the range and periodicity of these functions.

The functions sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic
