Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen numbers. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means she also won a prize, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the formula simplifies to:

P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B)

So I need to compute both P(A) and P(B), then divide them.

Let me first figure out P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. This is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since Jen picks 4 numbers, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers, the chance that all four match is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers divided by the total number of possible ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers.

Wait, no, actually, since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers, and Jen has already chosen 4 distinct numbers, the probability that all four are chosen is the number of favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes.

Total possible outcomes for the lottery: C(10,4), which is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10.

Favorable outcomes for grand prize: Only 1, because it's the exact set Jen picked.

So P(A) = 1 / C(10,4). Let me compute C(10,4). It's 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So P(A) = 1/210.

Now, let's compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers are chosen. That means she can have 2, 3, or 4 of her numbers in the lottery's 4 numbers.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute the complement: the probability of not winning a prize, i.e., having fewer than 2 numbers matching, which is 0 or 1 matching numbers. Then, P(B) = 1 - P(not winning a prize).

So, compute P(not B) = P(0 matches) + P(1 match).

Let me compute these.

First, total possible lottery picks: C(10,4) = 210. As before.

To compute P(0 matches): The lottery picks 4 numbers, none of which are in Jen's 4 numbers. So all 4 numbers are chosen from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10, and Jen has 4, so 10-4=6).

So the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6: C(6,4). That's 15.

So P(0 matches) = C(6,4)/C(10,4) = 15/210 = 1/14.

Next, P(1 match): The lottery picks 1 number from Jen's 4, and 3 from the remaining 6.

Number of ways: C(4,1) * C(6,3).

C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20. So 4*20=80.

So P(1 match) = 80/210 = 8/21.

Therefore, P(not B) = 15/210 + 80/210 = 95/210 = 19/42.

So P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = 23/42.

Wait, let me check that: 15 + 80 = 95, 95/210 simplifies to 19/42. So yes, 1 - 19/42 is 23/42.

So now, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Simplify that: (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, because 42 divided by 210 is 1/5, because 42*5=210. So yeah, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210)*(42/23) = (1/5)*(1/23) = 1/(115).

So the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m=1, n=115. They are coprime since 115 factors into 5*
