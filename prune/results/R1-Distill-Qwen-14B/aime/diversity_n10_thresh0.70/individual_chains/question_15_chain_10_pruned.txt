Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and have a length of 16. They need to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that on an 8x8 grid, moving from one corner to the opposite requires moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have a specific constraint: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Changing direction exactly four times means that the path alternates between moving right and up four times. Wait, let me clarify. Each time the direction changes, the path switches from R to U or U to R. So, if we have four direction changes, how does that translate to the structure of the path?

Let's think about it. If you start moving right, the first change will switch to up, the second change back to right, and so on. So, four direction changes would result in five segments of movement: right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me count again.

Wait, each direction change is a switch. So, starting with R, the first direction change is to U, that's one change. Then another change back to R is the second, and so on. So, for four direction changes, how many segments do we have? Let's see:

- Start with R, change to U: 1 change, 2 segments.
- Change back to R: 2 changes, 3 segments.
- Change to U: 3 changes, 4 segments.
- Change back to R: 4 changes, 5 segments.

So, four direction changes result in five segments. Each segment is a consecutive run of either R or U moves.

Now, each segment must consist of at least one step. So, each of these five segments (whether R or U) must have at least one step. But in an 8x8 grid, the total number of R steps is 8, and the total U steps is also 8.

So, our problem reduces to distributing these 8 R's and 8 U's into five segments, alternating between R and U, with each segment having at least one step. But wait, since the direction alternates, the number of R and U segments depends on whether we start with R or U.

Let me consider two cases: paths that start with R and those that start with U.

Case 1: The path starts with R. Then, the segments alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, there are three R segments and two U segments. Wait, no, because after four direction changes, starting with R, you end up with five segments. Let me visualize:

Segments: R, U, R, U, R. So, that's three R segments and two U segments.

Similarly, Case 2: Starting with U. Segments: U, R, U, R, U. So, three U segments and two R segments.

But in an 8x8 grid, we need exactly 8 R's and 8 U's. So, depending on the starting direction, the number of segments for R and U will differ.

Wait, let me make sure. For four direction changes, starting with R, we have five segments: R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments. Similarly, starting with U, five segments with three U and two R.

So, in both cases, the number of R and U segments depends on the starting direction.

Now, the problem is to distribute the 8 R's into either three (if starting with R) or two (if starting with U) segments, each segment having at least one R. Similarly for U's.

Wait, but starting with R, we have three R segments and two U segments. So, we need to distribute 8 R
