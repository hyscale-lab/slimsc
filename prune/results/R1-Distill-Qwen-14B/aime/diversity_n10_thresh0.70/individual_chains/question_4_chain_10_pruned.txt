Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of tokens. The rules are that each player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n (where n ≤ 2024) give Bob a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with two possible moves each turn: take 1 or 4 tokens. The player who takes the last token wins. So, it's similar to other impartial games like Nim, but with limited move options.

I think the key here is to determine for each n whether the starting player (Alice) can force a win, or if the second player (Bob) can. So, the problem is essentially asking for the number of n ≤ 2024 where Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves.

I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing for the player whose turn it is. A position is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position is one where there's at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

So, perhaps I should model this using dynamic programming or recursion. Let me try to find a pattern by calculating the winning and losing positions for small values of n.

Let's define a function f(n) where f(n) = True if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and False otherwise.

Base cases:
- If n = 0, the game is over, so the current player can't make a move and thus loses. So, f(0) = False.
- If n = 1, the current player takes 1 token and wins. So, f(1) = True.
- If n = 4, the current player takes 4 tokens and wins. So, f(4) = True.

Wait, but for n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take that last token and win. So, if the current player takes 1, opponent wins. Alternatively, the current player could take 4, but that's not possible because there are only 2 tokens. So, the current player can only take 1, leading to a loss. Therefore, f(2) = False.

Similarly, for n=3, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 2 tokens. Since f(2) is False, the opponent can't force a win from 2, meaning the current player can force a win by taking 1. So f(3) = True.

Wait, no, wait. If n=3, current player takes 1, leaving 2 tokens. The opponent is now in a position where f(2) is False, which means the opponent cannot win from there. So, the current player can force a win. So yes, f(3) = True.

n=4: current player takes all 4 and wins, so f(4)=True.

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4. Since f(4)=True, the opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is f
