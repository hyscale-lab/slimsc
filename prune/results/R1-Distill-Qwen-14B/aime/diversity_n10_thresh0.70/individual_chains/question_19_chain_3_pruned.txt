Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some important concepts and formulas that might be relevant here. The circumradius (R) is given as 13, and the inradius (r) is 6. The triangle has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. The incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the segment from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the segment from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. That seems like a key piece of information. I need to figure out how to use this condition to find AB·AC.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that right? Let me think. Oh yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, OI² = R(R - 2r).

Given R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI:

OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13

So OI = sqrt(13). That's useful.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, we're dealing with a right angle at I. So triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle with legs IO and IA, and hypotenuse OA.

Wait, OA is the circumradius, right? Because O is the circumcenter, so OA = R = 13.

So in triangle IOA, we have OA = 13, IO = sqrt(13), and IA is perpendicular to IO. So by the Pythagorean theorem:

OA² = IO² + IA²

So, 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²

169 = 13 + IA²

IA² = 169 - 13 = 156

So IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay.

But wait, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. There's a formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex. I think it's related to the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.

Yes, the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is:

IA = (r)/sin(A/2)

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall. I think it's IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Let me check. The inradius is related to the angles of the triangle.

Alternatively, I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the
