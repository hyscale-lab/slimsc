Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The hyperbola given is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along x, and the conjugate axis is along y.

Now, there are points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and we're looking for the supremum of BD², but we need the greatest number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses. Hmm, perhaps it's the minimum upper bound? Or maybe it's asking for the infimum of the upper bounds? Wait, no. The problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that number is the infimum of BD² across all possible such rhombuses. Because that number would be the lower bound, but it's the greatest such lower bound. Wait, no, actually, if we have multiple rhombuses, each with their own BD², and we need a number that is less than BD² for all of them. So, that number must be less than or equal to the minimum of BD² across all rhombuses. But the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, essentially, we need the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD². Because that would be the maximum number that is still less than or equal to all BD². So, BD² can be as small as possible, but we need the number that is the smallest possible upper bound? Wait, no, wait. Let me parse this again.

Wait, "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that is, for every rhombus, BD² is greater than this number. So, the number is a lower bound for BD². And we need the greatest such lower bound, which is the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombuses. So, the problem reduces
