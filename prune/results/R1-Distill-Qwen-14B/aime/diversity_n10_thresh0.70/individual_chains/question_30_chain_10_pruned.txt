Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, that means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the expression I need to compute is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that down:

Product = ∏ₖ₌₀¹² (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm, that's a product of 13 terms. Wait, but for k=0, let's compute that term first. When k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1²) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So the first term is 1. That simplifies things a bit because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. So really, the product is just from k=1 to 12 multiplied by 1, so it's the same as the product from k=1 to 12.

So, Product = ∏ₖ₌₁¹² (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm. Now, let's try to simplify each term in the product. Let me denote each term as (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern.

Let me write it as: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Wait, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k. Then each term becomes x² - 2x + 2. So the product becomes ∏ₖ₌₁¹² (x² - 2x + 2), where x = ω^k. But since ω^k are the 13th roots of unity except 1, this might relate to evaluating a polynomial at certain roots.

Wait, another thought: the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to Φ₁₃(x), the cyclotomic polynomial, because Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But since we're dealing with x² - 2x + 2, maybe we can find a relation between this quadratic and the cyclotomic polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the product as evaluating a certain polynomial at x=2. Let me see.

Wait, if I have a polynomial P(x) = ∏ₖ₌₁¹² (x - ω^k), which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So if I can relate the product (x² - 2x + 2) for x=ω^k to this, maybe I can find a way to compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each term is (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me factor this
