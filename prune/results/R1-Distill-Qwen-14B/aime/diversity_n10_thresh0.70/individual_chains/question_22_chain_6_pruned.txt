Okay, so I came across this geometry problem, and it's about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The problem mentions that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, an equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length. But it's also convex, so all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees, which also means it doesn't bend in any weird ways. Plus, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's interesting because in a regular hexagon (which is both equilateral and equiangular), opposite sides are parallel too. But this hexagon isn't necessarily regular since the triangle formed by extending some sides has sides of different lengths. So it's a more general case.

Alright, so the hexagon is labeled ABCDEF. Let me visualize that: A, B, C, D, E, F in order. Since it's a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, AB is parallel to ED, BC is parallel to FE, and CD is parallel to AF. That seems right because each opposite pair is separated by two sides.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Wait, so if I extend AB, CD, and EF until they meet, those extensions form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

I think I should draw a diagram to get a better sense of the problem. Since I can't actually draw it right now, I'll try to imagine it.

Let me denote the extensions:

- Extending AB beyond A and beyond B.
- Extending CD beyond C and beyond D.
- Extending EF beyond E and beyond F.

These three extended lines form a triangle. Let's say the intersection points of AB and CD, CD and EF, and EF and AB form the triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

Wait, perhaps it would help to assign some variables. Let's denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s.

Given that opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered a centrally symmetric hexagon? Or maybe similar to a regular hexagon but scaled.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the triangle formed by the extensions and relate it to the hexagon. Maybe using similar triangles or some proportional relationships.

Let me think about the lines AB, CD, EF. Since AB is parallel to ED, which is opposite, and CD is parallel to AF, etc. Wait, but the extensions of AB, CD, EF form a triangle. Hmm.

Perhaps I can model this using coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, and opposite sides are parallel,
