Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of them in the 25 unit cells of the grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. So, no two chips in the same cell.

The next condition is that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must be the same color. That means, for any given row, if there's a chip in that row, all the chips in that row must be the same color—either all white or all black. The same goes for columns: if there's a chip in a column, all chips in that column must be the same color.

Additionally, the placement must be such that any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous conditions. So, the current arrangement is maximal with respect to these conditions. That is, you can't add another chip without breaking either the same color per row or the same color per column rule.

Alright, so I need to find the number of such arrangements. Let's break down the problem.

First, let's think about the constraints. Each row can either be all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or empty. But if a row has any chips, all must be the same color, and similarly for columns.

Wait, but there's an interaction between rows and columns. For example, if a row is all white, then every column that intersects this row must also be all white or empty? Or not necessarily, because the column could be all black, but then the intersection cell would have both a white and a black chip, which isn't allowed because each cell can have at most one chip. Oh, wait, that's not possible because each cell can only have one chip. So if a row is white, then any column that has a chip in that row must also be white. Because if the column had a black chip in that row, that cell would have both a white and black chip, which is impossible. So, the color assigned to a row constrains the colors of the columns, and vice versa.

Wait, perhaps the grid has to be such that the rows and columns are colored in a way that their intersections are consistent—meaning, if a row is white, all its columns must also be white or something. Hmm, maybe it's better to model this as a matrix where each cell is either white, black, or empty, but subject to the row and column constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid must be divided into blocks where all rows and columns in a block are of the same color, and these blocks don't overlap. Wait, that might not capture all possibilities. Let me think.

Suppose we have some rows colored white and some black. Each time a row is colored, that affects the possible colors of the columns. For example, if row 1 is colored white, then every column that has a chip in row 1 must also be colored white. Because if a column has a chip in row 1 (which is white), then that column's color must be white. So, the columns that intersect with a white row must also be white.

Similarly, if a column is colored black, then any row that intersects that column
