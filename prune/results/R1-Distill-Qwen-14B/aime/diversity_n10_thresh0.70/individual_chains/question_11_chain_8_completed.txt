Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for any complex number \(z\), if \(|z| = r\), then the reciprocal of \(z\) is \(\frac{\overline{z}}{r^2}\), where \(\overline{z}\) is the complex conjugate of \(z\). So, since \(|z| = 4\), \(|z|^2 = 16\), which might come in handy later.

Let me write \(z\) in polar form because it might make things easier. So, \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). That way, I can express everything in terms of \(\theta\), which is a real number between 0 and \(2\pi\).

So, substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, I get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Let me simplify each term separately.

First term: \((75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta}\). Let's compute that scalar multiplication first. 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468. So, the first term becomes \(300 + 468i\) multiplied by \(e^{i\theta}\).

Wait, actually, no. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake there. Because \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \) is equal to \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\). So, perhaps I should factor that 4 out, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express everything as vectors in the complex plane and find their sum.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write both terms in terms of \(z\) and its conjugate, but since \(|z| = 4\), the conjugate is \( \overline{z} = \frac{16}{z} \). Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, another idea: Since \(z\) is on the circle of radius 4, the reciprocal \(1/z\) is on the circle of radius 1/4. So, maybe the expression can be written in terms of vectors scaled by 4 and 1/4, respectively.

But perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of \(z\) and \(1/z\), but since \(|z| = 4\), \(1/z = \overline{z}/16\), so maybe I can write the expression as:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{\overline{z}}{16}
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{(96 + 144i)}{16} \overline{z}
\]
\[
= (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i) \overline{z}
\]

Hmm, that seems better. So now, the expression is \( (75 + 117i) z + (6 + 9i) \overline{z} \).

Since we're looking for the maximum real part, maybe we can write this expression in terms of real and imaginary parts, then take the real part and maximize it.

Alternatively, another approach is to write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), so \(\overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta}\). Let's try substituting that in.

So substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) and \(\overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta}\) into the expression, we have:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4 e^{i\theta} + (6 + 9i) \cdot 4 e^{-i\theta}
\]
\[
= 4(75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} + 4(6 + 9i) e^{-i\theta}
\]

Factor out the 4:

\[
4[ (75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (6 + 9i)e^{-i\theta} ]
\]

Now, let's compute each term:

First term: \( (75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Second term: \( (6 + 9i)e^{-i\theta} \)

Let me compute these separately.

But perhaps it's better to express each term as a vector in terms of sine and cosine.

Recall that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, let's compute \( (75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \):

Multiplying out, we get:

\(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2 \sin\theta\)

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this becomes:

\(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta\)

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: \(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta\)

Imaginary: \(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta\) multiplied by i.

Similarly, for the second term \( (6 + 9i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \):

Multiply out:

\(6\cos\theta - 6i\sin\theta + 9i\cos\theta - 9i^2 \sin\theta\)

Again, \(i^2 = -1\), so:

\(6\cos\theta -6i\sin\theta +9i\cos\theta +9\sin\theta\)

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: \(6\cos\theta + 9\sin\theta\)

Imaginary: \(-6\sin\theta +9\cos\theta\) multiplied by i.

Now, putting it all together:

The first term is \(4 \times [ (75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta) ] \)

The second term is \(4 \times [ (6\cos\theta + 9\sin\theta) + i(-6\sin\theta +9\cos\theta) ] \)

Adding these together:

Real parts:

\(4[ (75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (6\cos\theta + 9\sin\theta) ] \)

Imaginary parts:

\(4[ (75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta) + (-6\sin\theta +9\cos\theta) ] \)

But since we're interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can focus on the real parts.

So, let's compute the real part:

Real part = \(4[ (75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (6\cos\theta + 9\sin\theta) ] \)

Combine like terms:

75cosθ + 6cosθ = 81cosθ

-117sinθ +9sinθ = -108sinθ

So, Real part = 4[81cosθ - 108sinθ]

Factor out 27 from the coefficients inside the brackets:

81 = 27 * 3; 108 = 27 * 4

So, Real part = 4 * 27 [3cosθ -4sinθ] = 108 [3cosθ -4sinθ]

So, Real part = 108*(3cosθ -4sinθ)

Hmm, that seems manageable. Now, our goal is to maximize this real part. So, we need to find the maximum value of 108*(3cosθ -4sinθ).

Well, I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ) or C sin(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude. The maximum value would then be C.

So, let's consider 3cosθ -4sinθ. Let me write this as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude.

The formula is A cosθ + B sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, actually, let me confirm.

Wait, more accurately, A cosθ + B sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ is such that cosφ = A/R and sinφ = B/R.

But in our case, it's 3cosθ -4sinθ, which is A=3, B=-4.

So, R = sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) =5.

So, 3cosθ -4sinθ =5 cos(θ + φ), where φ is such that cosφ = 3/5 and sinφ=4/5, but wait, B is -4, so maybe it's a different angle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as R cos(θ + φ), where R is 5, and φ is the angle whose cosine is 3/5 and sine is 4/5, but since the coefficient of sinθ is negative, perhaps φ is in a different quadrant.

Wait, let me think again. The general formula is:

A cosθ + B sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A² + B²), and φ = arctan(B/A). But in this case, B is negative, so φ would be in the fourth quadrant.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of 3cosθ -4sinθ as 5 cos(θ + α), where α is the angle such that cosα = 3/5 and sinα = 4/5. Wait, but wait, 3cosθ -4sinθ can be expressed as 5 cos(θ + α), where α is the angle where cosα = 3/5 and sinα = 4/5, but since the coefficient of sinθ is negative, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as 5 cos(θ + α), where α is in the first quadrant but with a negative coefficient.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think of it as 3cosθ -4sinθ =5 cos(θ + α), where α is such that cosα = 3/5 and sinα =4/5, so that when you expand 5cos(θ + α) =5cosθ cosα -5sinθ sinα =3cosθ -4sinθ.

So, yes, that works because 5*(3/5 cosθ) =3cosθ, and 5*(-4/5 sinθ) = -4 sinθ.

So, 3cosθ -4sinθ =5 cos(θ + α), where α is arctan(4/3), because cosα=3/5 and sinα=4/5.

So, the maximum value of 3cosθ -4sinθ is 5, so the maximum of 108*(3cosθ -4sinθ) is 108*5=540.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when I write 3cosθ -4sinθ as 5 cos(θ + α), the maximum value of cos is 1, so the maximum is 5. So, yes, 108*5=540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me think if this is correct. Because, in the expression, I had Real part =108*(3cosθ -4sinθ). So, the maximum of this is 108*5=540. So, that would be the maximum real part.

Wait, but I need to make sure that when I express 3cosθ -4sinθ as 5 cos(θ + α), I'm correctly accounting for the phase shift.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute this using calculus, to be sure.

Let me denote f(θ) = 3cosθ -4sinθ. Then, to find its maximum, take the derivative and set to zero.

df/dθ = -3 sinθ -4 cosθ.

Set to zero: -3 sinθ -4 cosθ =0.

So, 3 sinθ +4 cosθ=0.

Which implies tanθ = -4/3. So, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant.

Let me compute f(θ) at θ where tanθ= -4/3.

Let me take θ in the fourth quadrant, so sinθ = -4/5, cosθ=3/5.

Then, f(θ) =3*(3/5) -4*(-4/5) = 9/5 +16/5=25/5=5, which is positive.

Alternatively, if θ is in the second quadrant, sinθ=4/5, cosθ=-3/5.

f(θ) =3*(-3/5) -4*(4/5)= -9/5 -16/5= -25/5= -5, which is the minimum.

So, yeah, the maximum is indeed 5, and the minimum is -5. So, the maximum real part is 108*5=540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any scaling factors.

Wait, looking back, the Real part was 108*(3cosθ -4sinθ), which can be maximum 108*5=540.

So, is 540 the answer? Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me go back through the steps to ensure I didn't make any errors.

Starting from:

Real part = 108*(3cosθ -4sinθ)

Yes, because earlier steps showed that after expanding and combining terms, the real part was 108*(3cosθ -4sinθ).

Then, since 3cosθ -4sinθ can be written as 5 cos(θ + α), with maximum value 5, so 108*5=540 is the maximum real part.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using vectors or dot products.

Another approach: The expression (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z, with |z|=4.

Let me write this as (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i) \overline{z}/16, since 1/z = \overline{z}/16.

So, the expression becomes:

(75 +117i) z + (96 +144i) \overline{z}/16

Which simplifies to:

(75 +117i) z + (6 +9i) \overline{z}

Now, since z = 4 e^{iθ}, so \overline{z}=4 e^{-iθ}.

So, the expression is:

(75 +117i) *4 e^{iθ} + (6 +9i)*4 e^{-iθ}

=4*(75 +117i) e^{iθ} +4*(6 +9i) e^{-iθ}

Then, as before, this becomes:

4*[ (75 +117i)(cosθ +i sinθ) + (6 +9i)(cosθ -i sinθ) ]

Expanding each term:

First term: (75 +117i)(cosθ +i sinθ) =75 cosθ +75 i sinθ +117i cosθ +117i^2 sinθ
=75 cosθ +75i sinθ +117i cosθ -117 sinθ

Second term: (6 +9i)(cosθ -i sinθ)=6 cosθ -6i sinθ +9i cosθ -9i^2 sinθ
=6 cosθ -6i sinθ +9i cosθ +9 sinθ

Adding both terms:

Real parts:75 cosθ -117 sinθ +6 cosθ +9 sinθ =81 cosθ -108 sinθ

Imaginary parts:75 sinθ +117 cosθ -6 sinθ +9 cosθ = (75 sinθ -6 sinθ) + (117 cosθ +9 cosθ) =69 sinθ +126 cosθ

So, the real part is 4*(81 cosθ -108 sinθ) =4*27*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ)=108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ)

Which is the same as before. So, the maximum is 108*5=540.

Wait, so I think that confirms it. So, the maximum real part is 540.

But just to make sure, perhaps I can think of this as vectors in the complex plane. The expression is (75 +117i)z + (6 +9i) \overline{z}. So, if I denote A =75 +117i, and B=6 +9i, then the expression is A z + B \overline{z}.

Since |z|=4, then \overline{z} = 4^2 / z =16/z, so B \overline{z}=16 B / z.

Wait, but perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that for any complex numbers a and b, a z + b \overline{z} can be expressed in terms of their real and imaginary parts.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of expressing the real part as a function and then finding its maximum.

Wait, another idea: Let me represent z as 4 e^{iθ}, so the expression becomes:

(75 +117i) *4 e^{iθ} + (6 +9i)*4 e^{-iθ}

I can factor out the 4:

4 [ (75 +117i) e^{iθ} + (6 +9i) e^{-iθ} ]

Let me compute each term inside the brackets:

First term: (75 +117i) e^{iθ}

Second term: (6 +9i) e^{-iθ}

Let me compute (75 +117i) e^{iθ} + (6 +9i) e^{-iθ} as:

=75 e^{iθ} +117i e^{iθ} +6 e^{-iθ} +9i e^{-iθ}

Grouping terms:

= [75 e^{iθ} +6 e^{-iθ}] + i [117 e^{iθ} +9 e^{-iθ} ]

But perhaps another approach is to write this as a sum of exponentials and see if any simplifications can be done.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out something.

Wait, 75 and 6 have a common factor of 3, and 117 and 9 have a common factor of 9.

So, 75 =3*25, 6=3*2; 117=9*13, 9=9*1.

So, let me write:

=3*25 e^{iθ} +3*2 e^{-iθ} +i*(9*13 e^{iθ} +9*1 e^{-iθ})

=3[25 e^{iθ} + 2 e^{-iθ}] +9i [13 e^{iθ} +e^{-iθ}]

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but perhaps I can factor further.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the real parts and imaginary parts separately.

Wait, but perhaps this isn't necessary. Since we already did the earlier approach and found the maximum real part as 540, maybe it's safe to go with that.

Wait, but let me think again: the real part is 108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ), and since 3 cosθ -4 sinθ can be written as 5 cos(θ + α), then the maximum is 5, so 108*5=540.

Hence, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm once more. What's the maximum value of 3cosθ -4sinθ?

Yes, as we found earlier, it's 5, so 108*5=540. So, that's correct.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying each term:

1. \((75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\)
2. \(\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{(96 + 144i)}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\)

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding each term using \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\):

1. \(4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\)
2. \((24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)\)

After expanding and combining real and imaginary parts, the real part of the expression simplifies to:

\[
108(3\cos\theta - 4\sin\theta)
\]

To maximize this real part, we recognize that \(3\cos\theta - 4\sin\theta\) can be rewritten as \(5\cos(\theta + \alpha)\), where \(\alpha\) is such that \(\cos\alpha = \frac{3}{5}\) and \(\sin\alpha = \frac{4}{5}\). The maximum value of \(\cos(\theta + \alpha)\) is 1, so the maximum value of \(3\cos\theta - 4\sin\theta\) is 5. Therefore, the maximum real part is:

\[
108 \times 5 = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
