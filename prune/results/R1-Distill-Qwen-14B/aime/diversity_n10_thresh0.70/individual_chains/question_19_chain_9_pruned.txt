Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the product of AB and AC in triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumradius is 13, the inradius is 6, the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, that's a lot to unpack, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the area, and the inradius r is also related to the area and the semiperimeter. So maybe I can use those relationships here.

Wait, the problem gives me R = 13 and r = 6. So I know that R = 13, r = 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like an important piece of information. I need to figure out how that relates the sides of the triangle.

I recall that in a triangle, the inradius is located at the incenter I, which is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The circumradius is located at the circumcenter O, which is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. Depending on whether the triangle is acute, right, or obtuse, O can be inside or outside the triangle.

But in this case, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe that gives me some right triangles to work with. Let me try to visualize this. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the line IA forms a right angle with the line OI. So, perhaps triangle OIA is a right triangle with the right angle at I.

Wait, but IA is a segment from the incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the segment from circumcenter O to incenter I. So, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle OIA is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle OIA, we have:

- OI is the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I think there's a formula that relates OI, R, and r. Let me recall. Oh, right! The formula is OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Is that correct? Let me verify.

Yes, I think that's correct. Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI^2 = R(R - 2r). So, plugging in R = 13 and r = 6, we get:

OI^2 = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) = 13.

So, OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, that's useful.

Now, since triangle OIA is right-angled at I, by the Pythagorean theorem:

OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2.

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA = 13.

So, plugging in the known values:

13^2 = (sqrt(13))^2 + IA^2
169 = 13 + IA^2
IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Okay, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). That's the length from the incenter I to vertex A.

Now, I need to find AB * AC. Hmm. I remember that in a triangle, the length from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.

Let me think. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2), right? Wait, is that correct?

Yes, I think so. The formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2) and IC = r / sin(C/2).

So, IA = r / sin(A
