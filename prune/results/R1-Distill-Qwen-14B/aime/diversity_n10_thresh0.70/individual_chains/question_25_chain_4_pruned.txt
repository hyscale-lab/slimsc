Okay, so I have this problem from Aimeville, and I need to find the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me list out the given information:

- Total residents: 900
- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spade owners: 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900 people.
- Number of people owning exactly two items: 437
- Number of people owning exactly three items: 234

And I need to find those who own all four. Okay, so this seems like a problem involving sets and their intersections. Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula for the total number of elements in the union of four sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But wait, in this problem, we know the total number of residents, which is the same as the total number of people owning at least one item because everyone owns at least the candy hearts. So |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900.

But I'm not sure if I can apply the inclusion-exclusion formula directly here because I don't have all the pairwise or triple intersections. Maybe I need a different approach.

The problem also mentions that 437 own exactly two items, and 234 own exactly three. So perhaps I can use this information to find the number who own all four.

Let me denote:

- Let a be the number of people owning exactly two items.
- Let b be the number of people owning exactly three items.
- Let c be the number of people owning all four items.

We know that a = 437 and b = 234. Our goal is to find c.

I remember that in such problems, the total number of people can be expressed as the sum of people owning exactly one item, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. But wait, do we know anything about exactly one item?

Wait, let's think. The total number of residents is 900. So:

Total = Exactly 1 + Exactly 2 + Exactly 3 + Exactly 4.

But I don't know Exactly 1. However, maybe I can find it using the given data.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider each item's ownership count. For example, diamond rings are owned by 195 people. This includes people who own only diamond rings, those who own diamond rings and one other item, those who own diamond rings and two others, and those who own all four.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the sum of all individual ownerships.

The sum of the number of people owning each item is equal to the number of people owning exactly one item plus twice the number owning exactly two items, plus three times the number owning exactly three, plus four times the number owning exactly four.

Wait, let me make sure. For each item, the count is:

Sum = (Exactly 1) + 2*(Exactly 2) + 3*(Exactly 3) + 4*(Exactly 4)

Because each person who owns exactly two items contributes to two of the item counts, and so on.

So, for four items, the
