Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a 5x5 grid, and we need to place some chips on it. The chips are either white or black, and each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for each column. Also, any additional chip placed would break these conditions. So, the arrangement should be maximal in the sense that you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column color rules.

Wait, so each row can have either all white, all black, or no chips. Similarly, each column can have all white, all black, or no chips. But the arrangement must be such that adding another chip would force a row or column to have mixed colors.

So, let me think about what the possible configurations look like. Since each row must be all same color or empty, and the same for columns, the filled cells must form a sort of "rectangle" of a single color, but maybe more complex.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model each row and column as a binary choice: either it's white, black, or empty. But wait, no, because if a row is empty, that's a possibility. But the condition is that any additional chip would violate the condition. So, the grid is as filled as possible without violating the row and column constraints.

Wait, no. The problem says that any additional chip would violate the conditions, meaning that the current configuration is maximal for the rules. So, the arrangement is such that every empty cell cannot have a chip without making its row or column have mixed colors.

So, for each empty cell, adding a chip there would require that its row and column already have a single color, but adding a chip of the same color would not violate the condition. Wait, no: the current row and column must already have some chips of a color, so you can't add another color. So, the current arrangement must be such that every empty cell's row and column are either entirely of one color or empty. But if the row or column is non-empty, then it's already a single color, so adding another chip of that color would not violate the condition. Therefore, to prevent that, perhaps the empty cells must have either their row or column already containing chips of both colors? But no, the initial condition is that all chips in the same row and column are the same color.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here
