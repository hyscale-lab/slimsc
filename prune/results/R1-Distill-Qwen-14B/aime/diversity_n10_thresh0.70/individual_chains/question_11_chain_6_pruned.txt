Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First off, I remember that for any complex number \( z \), if its magnitude is 4, I can represent it as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier because exponentials are often easier to handle in these kinds of problems.

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), let me rewrite the expression. The first term is straightforward: \((75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta}\). The second term is a bit more involved: \(\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta}\).

So now, the entire expression becomes:
\[
(75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta}
\]
Let me compute the first term first. Multiplying out the constants:
\(75 \times 4 = 300\), and \(117 \times 4 = 468\), so the first term is \(300 + 468i\) multiplied by \(e^{i\theta}\).

Hmm, alternatively, maybe I should express everything in terms of sine and cosine. Since \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \), perhaps substituting these will help me separate the real and imaginary parts.

Let me denote \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \). Then, the expression is \( A z + \frac{B}{z} \). Substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), we have \( A \times 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{B}{4e^{i\theta}} \).

So, combining these, the expression becomes:
\[
4A e^{i\theta} + \frac{B}{4} e^{-i\theta}
\]
Since I'm interested in the real part, maybe I can compute the real part of each term separately.

Let me compute \( 4A e^{i\theta} \). First, \( A = 75 + 117i \), so \( 4A = 300 + 468i \). Then, \( 4A e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \). To find the real part of this, I'll multiply it out.

The real part will be \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \) because when you multiply \( (a + ib)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \), the real part is \( a\cos\theta - b\sin\theta \).

Similarly, for the second term \( \frac{B}{4} e^{-i\theta} \), \( B = 24 + 36i \), so \( \frac{B}{4} = 6 + 9i \). Then, \( (6 + 9i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \). The real part here is \(6\cos\theta + 9\sin\theta\).

Adding both real parts together, the total real part \( Re \) is:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (6\cos\theta + 9\sin\theta) = (300 + 6)\cos\theta + (-468 + 9)\sin\theta
\]
Simplifying the coefficients:
300 + 6 = 306
-468 + 9 = -459
So, \( Re = 306\cos\theta - 459\sin\theta \)

Now, I have the real part expressed as \( 306\cos\theta - 459\sin\theta \). I need to find the maximum value of this expression as \( \theta \) varies. 

This is a standard problem in trigonometry where we can express \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) as a single sinusoidal function. The maximum value of such an expression is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Wait, but here it's \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \), but in our case, it's \( 306\cos\theta - 459\sin\theta \). So the coefficients a and b are 306 and -459, respectively.

So, the maximum value is \( \sqrt{306^2 + (-459)^2} \). Let me compute that.

First, compute \( 306^2 \):
306 * 306: Let's compute 300^2 = 90000, 6^2=36, and the cross term 2*300*6=3600. So, (300 + 6)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*6 + 6^2 = 90000 + 3600 + 36 = 93636.

Next, compute \( 459^2 \). Hmm, 459 is 460 -1. So, (460 -1)^2 = 460^2 - 2*460*1 +1^2.

Compute 460^2: 46^2 = 2116, so 460^2 = 211600.

2*460*1 = 920, so subtract 920: 211600 - 920 = 210680.

Add 1: 210680 +1=210681.

But wait, since the coefficient is -459, its square is same as 459^2, so it's 210681.

So, sum of squares: 93636 + 210681.

Compute that: 93,636 + 210,681.

Let me add:

93,636 + 200,000 = 293,636

293,636 + 10,681 = 304,317

So, sqrt(304,317) ?

Wait, that seems a bit high, maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, first, 306^2: 300^2 is 90,000, 2*300*6=3,600, 6^2=36. So 90,000 + 3,600 +36 = 93,636. That's correct.

459^2: Let me compute it directly.

459 * 459:

Let's compute 400*400 = 160,000.

Wait, that's not helpful. Let's do it step by step.

Compute 459 * 459:

= (400 + 50 + 9)^2

But maybe it's easier to compute 459*459 as (460 -1)(460 -1) = 460^2 - 2*460 +1 = 211,600 - 920 +1= 210,681. So that's correct.

So sum is 93,636 + 210,681 = 304,317.

So sqrt(304,317). Hmm, let's estimate sqrt(304,317).

I know that 550^2 = 302,500. 552^2 = ?

552^2: 550^2 + 2*550*2 + 2^2 = 302,500 + 2,200 +4 = 304,704.

Wait, 552^2 is 304,704.

But our number is 304,317, which is less than that. So sqrt(304,317) is between 551 and 552.

Compute 551^2: 550^2 + 2*550*1 +1^2 = 302,500 + 1,100 + 1 = 303,601.

Hmm, 551^2 is 303,601, which is less than 304,317. The difference is 304,317 - 303,601 = 716.

So, 551 + x, where x is 716/(2*551) approximately. Since 2*551=1102. 716/1102≈0.65. So sqrt ≈551.65.

But maybe I should compute it more accurately, but perhaps I don't need to. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait a second, let me think again. The maximum value of \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) is indeed \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), but wait in our case, the expression is \( 306\cos\theta - 459\sin\theta \). So, the coefficients are 306 and -459. So, the amplitude is sqrt(306^2 + 459^2) which we computed as sqrt(304,317) ≈551.65.

But wait, that seems really large. Hmm, but given the coefficients, 306 and 459, it's possible.

Wait, but let me think again: is that expression correct? Because when I substituted everything, I have 306 cosθ - 459 sinθ, which is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should factor out something. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out something from 306 and 459. Let's see: 306 and 459.

What's the GCD of 306 and 459? Let's see:

459 ÷ 306 = 1 with remainder 153.

306 ÷153=2 with remainder 0. So GCD is 153.

So 306 = 153 * 2, 459 = 153 * 3.

So, 306 cosθ -459 sinθ = 153*(2cosθ -3 sinθ). 

That might be helpful. So, the expression is 153*(2cosθ -3 sinθ). 

The maximum of (2cosθ -3 sinθ) is sqrt(2^2 + (-3)^2) = sqrt(4 +9)=sqrt(13). So, the maximum of the expression is 153*sqrt(13).

Wait, that's a much cleaner answer. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Let me check:

In the expression, 306 cosθ -459 sinθ = 153*(2 cosθ - 3 sinθ).

So, the amplitude is 153*sqrt(2^2 + (-3)^2) = 153*sqrt(13). 

So, sqrt(13) is approximately 3.6055, so 153 *3.6055≈153*3.6=550.8. So, similar to the earlier approximate value.

So, 153*sqrt(13) would be the maximum real part.

Wait, so why did I get earlier  sqrt(306^2 +459^2)=sqrt(304,317)=approximately 551.65, which is the same as 15
