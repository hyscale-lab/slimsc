Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product of x and y, given that both are greater than 1. The equations I have are log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make things simpler. So, if log_x(y^x) = 10, that means x raised to the power of 10 equals y^x. Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 implies that y raised to the power of 10 equals x^{4y}.

Let me write these down:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10 ⇒ x^{10} = y^x
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 ⇒ y^{10} = x^{4y}

So now I have two equations:
- Equation (1): x^{10} = y^x
- Equation (2): y^{10} = x^{4y}

I need to solve for x and y. Since both equations involve x and y in exponents, maybe taking logarithms again could help, or perhaps expressing one variable in terms of the other.

Let me see if I can express y from Equation (1) in terms of x. From Equation (1):

x^{10} = y^x ⇒ y = x^{10/x}

That's because if I take both sides to the power of 1/x, I get y = (x^{10})^{1/x} = x^{10/x}.

So y is equal to x raised to the power of 10/x. That's interesting. Now I can substitute this expression for y into Equation (2) to solve for x.

So, substituting into Equation (2): y^{10} = x^{4y}

First, y is x^{10/x}, so let's plug that in:

(x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{4y}

Simplify the left side: (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{(10/x)*10} = x^{100/x}

And the right side is x^{4y}. But since y is x^{10/x}, 4y is 4*x^{10/x}.

So, we have:

x^{100/x} = x^{4 * x^{10/x}}

Since the bases are the same (both are x), the exponents must be equal. So:

100/x = 4 * x^{10/x}

Hmm, okay, so now I have an equation that relates x to itself in an exponent. This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can make a substitution. Let me think. Let me set z = x^{10/x}, which from Equation (1) is equal to y. Wait, but since y is expressed in terms of x, maybe substituting z would help. Alternatively, maybe I can take logarithms again.

Wait, another thought. Since we have 100/x = 4 * x^{10/x}, perhaps dividing both sides by 4 would make it 25/x = x^{10/x}.

So, 25/x = x^{10/x}

Taking logarithms on both sides might help. Let's take natural logarithm, though any base would work.

ln(25/x) = ln(x^{10/x})

Simplify the right side: (10/x) * ln x

Left side: ln(25) - ln x

So:

ln(25) - ln x = (10/x) * ln x

Let me rearrange this equation:

ln(25) = (10/x) * ln x + ln x

Hmm, factor out ln x:

ln(25) = ln x [10/x + 1]

That's a bit better. Let me write this as:

ln(25) = ln x (1 + 10/x)

Hmm, maybe I can express this as:

ln(25) = ln x * (x + 10)/x

So,

ln(25) = [ (x + 10) / x ] * ln x

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, meaning it might not have an algebraic solution. But perhaps there's a substitution I can make. Let me think if there's a value for x that would make both sides equal. Maybe x is 5? Let me try.

If x =5:

Left side: ln(25) = 2 ln 5 ≈ 2 * 1.609 ≈ 3.218

Right side: [ (5 +10)/5 ] * ln 5 = (15/5) * ln5 = 3 * 1.609 ≈ 4.828

Hmm, that's larger than 3.218, so not equal.

What if x=25?

Left side: ln(25) ≈ 3.218

Right side: (25+10)/25 * ln25 = 35/25 * 3.218 ≈ 1.4 *3.218 ≈4.505. Still bigger.

Hmm, perhaps x is smaller than 5. Let's try x=4.

Left side: ln(25) ≈3.218

Right side: (4+10)/4 * ln4 =14/4 *1.386 ≈3.5 *1.386≈4.851. Still bigger.

Hmm, maybe x= something like 10? Wait, x has to be greater than 1, and we're trying to find a point where both sides are equal. Alternatively, maybe I can set t = x, and write the equation as:

ln(25) = [ (t + 10)/t ] * ln t

Which is:

ln(25) = (1 + 10/t) * ln t

I don't know if I can solve this analytically, but maybe I can think of t where ln t is proportional to ln 25.

Wait, 25 is 5 squared, so ln25 is 2 ln5. Let me think if t has anything to do with 5.

Wait, what if t=5? Wait, I tried that earlier, and it didn't work. The right side was 3 ln5, which is about 4.828, while ln25 is 2 ln5, which is 3.218.

Alternatively, maybe t= something else.

Wait, perhaps t=10? Let me check.

ln(25)=3.218

Right side: (10+10)/10 * ln10 =2 * 2.302≈4.604. Still bigger.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe t= 25/ something.

Wait, perhaps t=25/ something. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I can express the equation differently.

Let me write [ (x +10)/x ] as [1 + 10/x], so:

ln(25) = [1 + 10/x] * ln x

Let me rearrange:

ln(25) = ln x + (10/x) ln x

Which is ln(25) = ln x + ln x^{10/x}

But wait, from Equation (1), ln x^{10/x} is ln y, because y =x^{10/x}. So, this becomes:

ln(25) = ln x + ln y

Which is ln(25) = ln(x y)

Ah! That's a key insight. So, ln(xy) = ln(25), which implies that xy =25.

Wait, that's perfect! Because if ln(xy)=ln25, then xy=25. So, the product of x and y is 25. That seems too straightforward, but let me verify.

Wait, let me go back step by step.

From Equation (1): y =x^{10/x}

From Equation (2): I did substitution and eventually got ln(25) = ln x + ln y.

So, ln x + ln y = ln(xy) = ln25 ⇒ xy=25.

Wow, that's a much simpler way to get the product.

So, without having to solve for x and y individually, the product is 25.

So, the answer is 25.


Given the equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10 \Rightarrow x^{10} = y^x\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \Rightarrow y^{10} = x^{4y}\)

From the first equation, express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
\[ y = x^{10/x} \]

Substitute \(y = x^{10/x}\) into the second equation:
\[ (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{4 \cdot x^{10/x}} \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ x^{100/x} = x^{4 \cdot x^{10/x}} \]
Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal:
\[ \frac{100}{x} = 4 \cdot x^{10/x} \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{25}{x} = x^{10/x} \]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ \ln\left(\frac{25}{x}\right) = \ln\left(x^{10/x}\right) \]
Simplify:
\[ \ln(25) - \ln(x) = \frac{10}{x} \ln(x) \]
Rearrange:
\[ \ln(25) = \ln(x) \left(1 + \frac{10}{x}\right) \]
Factor:
\[ \ln(25) = \ln(x) \cdot \frac{x + 10}{x} \]

Notice that this can be rewritten as:
\[ \ln(25) = \ln(x) + \ln\left(x^{10/x}\right) \]
Since \(x^{10/x} = y\), this becomes:
\[ \ln(25) = \ln(x) + \ln(y) \]
Thus:
\[ \ln(25) = \ln(xy) \]
Exponentiating both sides:
\[ xy = 25 \]

Therefore, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
