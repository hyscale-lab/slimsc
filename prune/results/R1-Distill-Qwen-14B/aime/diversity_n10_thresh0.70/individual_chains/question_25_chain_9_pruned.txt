Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we're given data about residents of Aimeville and the items they own. We need to find out how many own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. 

Hmm, let's break down the information. There are 900 residents in total. 

Each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts, which is one of the four items. So, everyone owns at least one thing, which is the candy hearts. The other three—diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade—are optional, I guess.

Now, the numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- All 900 own a bag of candy hearts.

Additionally, we know that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're to find out how many own all four.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that when dealing with overlapping sets, inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the total number without double-counting overlaps.

Wait, but in this case, we have four sets, right? So, the four items—let me denote them as D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and H (hearts). Since everyone owns H, that simplifies things a bit. Because H is common to all, the total number of residents is the same as the total number of owners of H, which is 900.

Wait, so if I consider the other three items, D, G, and S, their ownerships are subsets of the 900. But the problem is about all four, so I'll have to consider all four. 

But inclusion-exclusion for four sets is a bit more complex. Let me recall the formula. For four sets, the inclusion-exclusion formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ H| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩H| - |G∩S| - |G∩H| - |S∩H| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩H| + |D∩S∩H| + |G∩S∩H| - |D∩G∩S∩H|

But wait, since everyone owns H, H is a universal set here. So, the union |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ H| is just 900, because everyone is in H.

So, substituting that, we have:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩H| - |G∩S| - |G∩H| - |S∩H| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩H| + |D
