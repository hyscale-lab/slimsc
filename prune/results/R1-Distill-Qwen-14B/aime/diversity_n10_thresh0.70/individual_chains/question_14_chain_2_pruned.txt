Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. 

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 should result in a number that's a multiple of 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A being the thousands place, B the hundreds, C the tens, and D the units. So A can't be zero because it's a four-digit number.

Now, the condition is that if I change any one digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, for each position (A, B, C, D), replacing that digit with 1 should give a number divisible by 7. 

That gives me four conditions:

1. Replacing A with 1: 1BCD is divisible by 7.
2. Replacing B with 1: A1CD is divisible by 7.
3. Replacing C with 1: AB1D is divisible by 7.
4. Replacing D with 1: ABC1 is divisible by 7.

I need to find the largest possible N that satisfies all these conditions.

Since we're looking for the greatest such number, it's logical to start from 9999 and check downwards, but that might take too long. Instead, perhaps I can find constraints on each digit based on the divisibility conditions.

Let me consider each condition one by one and see what information I can extract.

First, let's write the four conditions mathematically.

1. Changing A to 1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Wait, actually, let me correct that. Each digit is in a different place value. So:

1. Changing A to 1: 1*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
2. Changing B to 1: A*1000 + 1*100 + C*10 + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
3. Changing C to 1: A*1000 + B*100 + 1*10 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
4. Changing D to 1: A*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me think about each expression modulo 7. Maybe I can express each in terms of N. Let me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N ≡ something mod 7, but when we change a digit, we can express the change in terms of N.

For example, when changing A to 1, the new number is (1)*1000 + 100B + 10C + D. The original N was A*1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So the difference is (1 - A)*1000. So the new number is N - (A - 1)*1000.

Similarly, for other digits:

- Changing B to 1: N - (B -1)*100.
- Changing C to 1: N - (C -1)*10.
- Changing D to 1: N - (D -1)*1.

Each of these must be ≡0 mod7.

So, for each digit change, we have:

1. N - (A -1)*1000 ≡0 mod7 ⇒ N ≡ (A-1)*1000 mod7.
2. N - (B -1)*100 ≡0 mod7 ⇒ N ≡ (B-1)*100 mod7.
3. N - (C -1)*10 ≡0 mod7 ⇒ N ≡ (C-1)*10 mod7.
4. N - (D -1)*1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒ N ≡ (D-1) mod7.

Wait, that's an interesting way to look at it. So N must be congruent to each of these expressions modulo 7. But N is the same in all four cases, so all these four expressions must be congruent to each other modulo 7.

Alternatively, we can write:

(From condition 1) N ≡ (A-1)*1000 mod7.
(From condition 2) N ≡ (B-1)*100 mod7.
(From condition 3) N ≡ (C-1)*10 mod7.
(From condition 4) N ≡ (D-1) mod7.

Since all these are equal to N mod7, they must all be equal to each other mod7. So:

(A-1)*1000 ≡ (B-1)*100 ≡ (C-1)*10 ≡ (D-1) mod7.

That's a set of congruences that all four expressions must satisfy.

Let me compute the coefficients modulo7:

First, 1000 mod7: Let's compute 1000 /7. 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 /7=14*7=98, 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3, since 10-7=3.

And 1 mod7=1.

So now, substituting these into the congruences:

(A-1)*6 ≡ (B-1)*2 ≡ (C-1)*3 ≡ (D-1) mod7.

Let me denote:

Let’s let x = (A-1)*6 mod7,

y = (B-1)*2 mod7,

z = (C-1)*3 mod7,

w = (D-1) mod7.

We have x ≡ y ≡ z ≡ w mod7, meaning all are equal to the same value, say, k, modulo7.

So:

(A-1)*6 ≡ k mod7,

(B-1)*2 ≡ k mod7,

(C-1)*3 ≡ k mod7,

(D-1) ≡ k mod7.

So, let me express each digit in terms of k:

From (A-1)*6 ≡ k mod7,

(A-1) ≡ k * 6^{-1} mod7.

Similarly, 6 inverse mod7 is the number m where 6m ≡1 mod7. 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so 6^{-1}=6 mod7.

So, (A-1) ≡k *6 mod7.

Similarly, for (B-1
