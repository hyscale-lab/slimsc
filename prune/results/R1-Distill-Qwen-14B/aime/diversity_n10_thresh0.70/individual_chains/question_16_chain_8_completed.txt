Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The problem says:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \)."

Hmm. So, I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Once I find that prime \( p \), then I need to find the smallest \( m \) where \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). That means \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). So, \( n^4 \) is congruent to -1 modulo \( p^2 \).

I remember that for primes, certain conditions must be met for such congruences to have solutions. Maybe I should look at primes where the equation \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution, because if it doesn't have a solution modulo \( p \), it certainly won't modulo \( p^2 \).

So, first, I should find primes \( p \) where \( -1 \) is a quartic residue modulo \( p \). In other words, there exists some integer \( x \) such that \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \).

I also recall that for odd primes \( p \), the equation \( x^2 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution if and only if \( p \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). But here, we're dealing with a quartic congruence, so I think the conditions are a bit different.

Let me think about the multiplicative group modulo \( p \). The multiplicative group is cyclic of order \( p - 1 \). So, an element \( x \) has order dividing \( 8 \) if \( x^4 \equiv 1 \mod p \). Wait, but we have \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \), which is different.

If \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \), then \( x^8 \equiv 1 \mod p \). Therefore, the order of \( x \) modulo \( p \) must divide 8, but since \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \), the order can't be less than 8. So, the order is exactly 8. Therefore, 8 must divide the order of the multiplicative group modulo \( p \), which is \( p - 1 \). So, \( p - 1 \) must be divisible by 8. So, \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).

Wait, but let me check that. If the multiplicative group has order \( p - 1 \), and an element has order 8, then 8 must divide \( p - 1 \). So, \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).

But wait, is that the only condition? Let me think. For \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \), the equation must have a solution. So, the multiplicative group modulo \( p \) must have an element of order 8. That requires that the group order \( p - 1 \) is divisible by 8, as the order of any element divides the group order.

So, \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) is a necessary condition.

Wait, but are there other primes where this might hold? For example, \( p = 2 \). Let me check. If \( p = 2 \), does \( n^4 + 1 \) ever get divisible by \( 4 \)?

Let me compute \( n^4 \mod 4 \). For any integer \( n \), if it's even, say \( n = 2k \), then \( n^4 = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \). So, \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), which isn't divisible by 4. If \( n \) is odd, \( n = 2k + 1 \), then \( n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), so \( n^4 = (n^2)^2 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \), which is also not divisible by 4. So, \( p = 2 \) is out.

Next, \( p = 3 \). Let me see if \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \) is possible.

Compute \( n^4 \mod 9 \). Let me list the possible residues modulo 9.

Compute \( 0^4 = 0 \mod 9 \), \( 1^4 = 1 \mod 9 \), \( 2^4 = 16 \equiv 7 \mod 9 \), \( 3^4 = 81 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \), \( 4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 16^2 = 256 \mod 9 \). Wait, 16 mod 9 is 7, so 7^2 = 49 ≡ 4 mod 9. So, 4^4 ≡ 4 mod 9.

Similarly, 5^4: 5 mod 9 is 5, 5^2 =25≡7, 7^2=49≡4 mod9. So, 5^4≡4.

6^4: 6 mod9, 6^2=36≡0, so 0^2=0.

7^4: same as (-2)^4=16≡7 mod9.

8^4: same as (-1)^4=1 mod9.

So the possible residues for \( n^4 \mod 9 \) are 0,1,4,7.

So, \( n^4 + 1 \mod 9 \) can be 1,2,5,8. None of these are 0, so \( p = 3 \) is impossible.

Next prime is 5. Let's check \( p =5 \).

Compute \( n^4 \mod 25 \). Hmm, maybe a bit tedious, but let me see.

Alternatively, first check modulo 5, then lift using Hensel's lemma if possible.

First, check if \( x^4 ≡ -1 \mod 5 \). So, \( x^4 ≡ 4 \mod 5 \).

Compute \( 1^4 =1 mod5 \), \( 2^4=16≡1 mod5 \), \( 3^4=81≡1 mod5 \), \(4^4=256≡1 mod5\). Wait, none of these are 4 mod5. So, does \( x^4 ≡-1 \mod5 \) have a solution?

Wait, \( x^4 \) mod5 can be 0 or 1. Because 2^4=16≡1, 3^4=81≡1, 4^4=256≡1. So, x^4 mod5 is 0 or 1. So, it's impossible for x^4 ≡4 mod5. Therefore, \( p=5 \) is not possible.

Next prime, \( p=7 \). Let's check if \( x^4 ≡-1 mod7 \) has a solution.

Compute x^4 mod7.

Compute 1^4=1.

2^4=16≡2.

3^4=81≡4.

4^4=256≡4.

5^4=625≡625-7*89=625-623=2.

6^4=1296≡1296-7*185=1296-1295=1.

So, possible x^4 mod7: 1,2,4.

-1 mod7 is 6. So, 1,2,4 don't include 6. So, no solution for x^4 ≡-1 mod7. Therefore, p=7 is out.

Next prime, p=11. Wait, but wait, earlier I thought p≡1 mod8. Let me check p=17, but wait, let's make sure.

Wait, p=17 is 1 mod16, but earlier I thought p≡1 mod8. So p=17 is 1 mod16, which is also 1 mod8. So, maybe p=17 is a candidate.

Wait, but before that, let's check p=13.

Wait, perhaps I should list primes in order and check.

Primes in order: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,...

We've already checked 2,3,5,7. Next is 11.

Check p=11. Does x^4 ≡-1 mod11 have a solution?

Compute x^4 mod11. Let's compute for x from 0 to 10:

0: 0

1:1

2:16≡5

3:81≡4

4:256≡256-11*23=256-253=3

5:625≡625-11*56=625-616=9

6:1296≡1296-11*117=1296-1287=9

7:2401≡2401-11*218=2401-2398=3

8:4096≡4096-11*372=4096-4092=4

9:6561≡6561-11*596=6561-6556=5

10:10000≡10000-11*909=10000-9999=1.

So, the quartic residues mod11 are 0,1,3,4,5,9.

-1 mod11 is 10. 10 is not among the quartic residues. So, no solution.

Next prime p=13.

Check if x^4≡-1 mod13 has a solution.

Compute x^4 mod13 for x=0,1,...,12.

0:0

1:1

2:16≡3

3:81≡3

4:256≡256-13*19=256-247=9

5:625≡625-13*48=625-624=1

6:1296≡1296-13*99=1296-1287=9

7:2401≡2401-13*184=2401-2392=9

Wait, let me compute 7^4:

7^2=49≡49-13*3=10. So 7^4=(7^2)^2=10^2=100≡9 mod13.

Similarly, 8^4: 8^2=64≡64-13*4=12; 12^2=144≡1.

9^4: 9^2=81≡3; 3^2=9.

10^4:10^2=100≡9; 9^2=81≡3.

11^4:11^2=121≡4; 4^2=16≡3.

12^4:12^2=144≡1; 1^2=1.

So, quartic residues mod13: 0,1,3,9.

-1 mod13 is12. 12 not in {0,1,3,9}, so no solution. So p=13 is out.

Next, p=17, which is 1 mod8. Let's check if x^4 ≡-1 mod17 has a solution.

Compute x^4 mod17.

Let me compute x=1:1, x=2:16, x=3:81≡13, x=4:256≡1, x=5:625≡625-17*36=625-612=13, x=6:1296≡1296-17*76=1296-1292=4, x=7:2401≡2401-17*141=2401-2397=4, x=8:4096≡4096-17*241=4096-4097=-1≡16 mod17.

Wait, x=8: 8^4=4096. 17*241=4097, so 4096≡-1 mod17. So, 8^4≡-1 mod17. So yes, there is a solution mod17.

Therefore, p=17 is a candidate, as it's the first prime where x^4 ≡-1 modp has a solution. But wait, we were supposed to find p where p^2 divides n^4 +1. So, even if we have a solution mod p, does it lift to a solution mod p^2?

Hmm. So, I think Hensel's lemma might help here. If f(x) = x^4 +1, and if f(a) ≡0 modp and f'(a) not≡0 modp, then we can lift the solution to mod p^2. So, let's compute f'(x)=4x^3. So, f'(a) modp=4a^3 modp. Since a is a solution modp, a^4 ≡-1 modp. So, a^4 = -1 + kp.

So, a^3= (-1 + kp)^(3/4). Hmm, maybe a better approach. Alternatively, compute a^3 modp.

Wait, but a^4 ≡-1 modp, so a^4 = -1 + kp. So, a^3 = (-1 + kp)/a.

But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, compute f'(a)=4a^3. Since a^4 ≡-1 modp, a^3 ≡ (-1)/a modp.

So, f'(a) ≡4*(-1)/a modp. So, 4*(-1)/a modp. For Hensel's lemma, we require that f'(a) not≡0 modp, which would mean that 4*(-1)/a not≡0 modp. Since p doesn't divide 4 or a (as a is non-zero modp), this is true. Therefore, Hensel's lemma tells us that if f(a) ≡0 modp and f'(a) not≡0 modp, then there's a unique lift of a solution mod p^2.

Therefore, for p=17, there exists a solution x ≡a mod17 such that x^4 ≡-1 mod17^2=289. So, p=17 is the least prime for which p^2 divides n^4 +1 for some n.

So, p=17. Now, the second part is to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by 17^2=289.

So, we need to find the smallest m where m^4 ≡-1 mod289.

From earlier, we know that mod17, m ≡8 mod17 because 8^4=4096≡-1 mod17.

So, let's let m=8 +17k, where k is an integer, and find the smallest k such that (8+17k)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

We can compute (8 +17k)^4 mod289. Since 289=17^2, we can expand this using the binomial theorem, keeping terms up to 17^2 because higher terms will be multiples of 17^2 and thus 0 mod289.

So, (8 +17k)^4 = 8^4 + 4*8^3*(17k) + 6*8^2*(17k)^2 + 4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Compute each term modulo289:

- 8^4=4096. 4096 /289: 289*14=4046. 4096-4046=50. So, 8^4≡50 mod289.

- 4*8^3*(17k) =4*(512)*(17k) mod289. 512 mod17: since 17*30=510, so 512≡2 mod17. So, 512=17*30+2. So, 4*512*17k=4*(2 +17*30)*17k= (8 + 4*17*30)*17k. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 4*512*17k mod289. 512 mod289: 289*1=289, 512-289=223, so 512≡223 mod289.

So, 4*223*17k= 4*17*223*k mod289. 4*17=68, 68*223=15224. Now, compute 15224 mod289.

But 289*52=15028. 15224-15028=196. So, 4*8^3*17k ≡196k mod289.

- 6*8^2*(17k)^2: 6*64*(289k^2). But 289k^2 is 0 mod289, so this term is 0.

- 4*8*(17k)^3: Similarly, (17k)^3 is 17^3*k^3=4913k^3, which is 0 mod289 because 4913=17^3, and 17^2=289 divides 4913. So, this term is 0.

- (17k)^4: 17^4k^4, which is 0 mod289.

So, putting it all together:

(8 +17k)^4 ≡50 +196k mod289.

We need this to be ≡-1 mod289. So,

50 +196k ≡ -1 mod289.

So, 196k ≡ -51 mod289.

Compute -51 mod289: 289-51=238.

So, 196k ≡238 mod289.

We can write this as 196k ≡238 mod289.

Let me simplify this congruence. First, find the GCD of 196 and 289.

289 is 17^2=289. 196 is 14^2=196. 14 and17 are coprime, so GCD(196,289)=1, because 17 doesn't divide 196.

Therefore, 196 has an inverse modulo289. Let's find the inverse of 196 mod289.

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

Compute GCD(196,289):

289 =1*196 +93

196=2*93 +8

93=11*8 +5

8=1*5 +3

5=1*3 +2

3=1*2 +1

2=2*1 +0

So, GCD is1.

Now, backtracking to find the inverse:

1=3-1*2

But 2=5-1*3, so 1=3 -1*(5-1*3)=2*3 -1*5

But 3=8 -1*5, so 1=2*(8 -1*5) -1*5=2*8 -3*5

But 5=93 -11*8, so 1=2*8 -3*(93 -11*8)=2*8 -3*93 +33*8=35*8 -3*93

But 8=196 -2*93, so 1=35*(196 -2*93) -3*93=35*196 -70*93 -3*93=35*196 -73*93

But 93=289 -1*196, so 1=35*196 -73*(289 -196)=35*196 -73*289 +73*196=(35+73)*196 -73*289=108*196 -73*289

Therefore, 108*196 ≡1 mod289.

So, the inverse of196 mod289 is108.

So, back to the equation:

196k ≡238 mod289

Multiply both sides by108:

k ≡238*108 mod289

Compute 238*108:

Let me compute 200*108=21,600

38*108=4,104

Total:21,600 +4,104=25,704

Now, compute 25,704 mod289.

Divide 25,704 by289:

289*88=289*(90-2)=289*90 -289*2=26,010 -578=25,432

25,704 -25,432=272

So, 25,704 ≡272 mod289.

So, k≡272 mod289.

So, the smallest positive integer k is272.

Wait, but 272 is less than289, so k=272 is the solution.

Wait, but that would mean m=8 +17k=8 +17*272.

Wait, 17*272=4,624. So, m=8 +4,624=4,632.

Wait, that seems quite large. But let me check if a smaller k is possible. Because k≡272 mod289, the minimal positive k is272. But let me see if I made a mistake in computation somewhere.

Wait, when I was computing 238*108, maybe I should compute it differently mod289.

Alternatively, perhaps compute 238 mod289 is238, 108 mod289 is108.

Compute 238*108:

Compute 200*108=21,600

38*108=4,104 → total 25,704.

Compute 25,704 ÷289.

Find how many times 289 goes into 25,704.

Since 289*88=25,432, as before. 25,704-25,432=272.

So, 25,704 ≡272 mod289.

So, yes, k=272 mod289.

But that would mean m=8 +17*272=8 +4,624=4,632.

But that's a big number. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I can find a smaller m by considering that m ≡8 mod17, and we're looking for the smallest m such that m^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute (8 +17k)^4 mod289 and find the smallest k where this is ≡-1.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (8 +17k)^4 mod289 directly for small k.

Let me compute for k=1:

m=8+17=25.

25^4=390625.

Compute 390625 mod289.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute step by step:

Compute 25 mod289=25.

25^2=625 mod289: 289*2=578, 625-578=47. So, 25^2≡47 mod289.

25^4=(25^2)^2=47^2=2209.

2209 mod289: 289*7=2023, 2209-2023=186.

So, 25^4≡186 mod289. We need this to be ≡288 (which is -1 mod289). 186≠288, so k=1 doesn't work.

k=2: m=8+34=42.

Compute 42^4 mod289.

42 mod289=42.

42^2=1764. 1764 ÷289: 289*6=1734. 1764-1734=30. So, 42^2≡30 mod289.

42^4=(30)^2=900. 900-289*3=900-867=33. So, 42^4≡33 mod289≠288.

k=3: m=8+51=59.

Compute 59^4 mod289.

59 mod289=59.

59^2=3481. 3481 ÷289: 289*12=3468. 3481-3468=13. So, 59^2≡13 mod289.

59^4=13^2=169 mod289. 169≠288.

k=4: m=8+68=76.

76 mod289=76.

76^2=5776. 5776 ÷289: 289*19=5491. 5776-5491=285. 285≡-4 mod289.

76^4=(-4)^2=16 mod289. 16≠288.

k=5: m=8+85=93.

93 mod289=93.

93^2=8649. 8649 ÷289: 289*30=8670, which is more than 8649. 289*29=8381. 8649-8381=268. So, 93^2≡268 mod289.

93^4=(268)^2=71,824 mod289.

Compute 289*248=289*(250-2)=289*250=72,250 minus 289*2=578 →72,250-578=71,672.

71,824 -71,672=152. So, 93^4≡152 mod289. Not equal to 288.

k=6: m=8+102=110.

110 mod289=110.

110^2=12,100. 12,100 ÷289: 289*41=11,849. 12,100-11,849=251. So, 110^2≡251 mod289.

110^4=251^2=63,001 mod289.

Compute 289*217=289*(200+17)=57,800 +4,913=62,713. 63,001-62,713=288. So, 110^4≡288 mod289.

Ah! So, when k=6, m=110, m^4 ≡288≡-1 mod289.

So, that's the solution.

Wait, so earlier when I used the equation and found k=272, which gives m=4,632, but here, for k=6, m=110 works. But 110 is much smaller than 4,632. So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion when applying the binomial theorem. Let me check that again.

Earlier, I wrote (8 +17k)^4 ≡50 +196k mod289. But when I computed for k=6, 50 +196*6=50 +1,176=1,226. Then 1,226 mod289: 289*4=1,156. 1,226-1,156=70. But when I computed 110^4 mod289, it was 288. So, clearly, my expansion was wrong.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the coefficients in the binomial expansion. Let me try that again.

Compute (8 +17k)^4:

=8^4 + 4*8^3*(17k) +6*8^2*(17k)^2 +4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Compute each term mod289:

- 8^4=4096 mod289: 289*14=4046. 4096-4046=50. So, 8^4≡50.

- 4*8^3*(17k): 8^3=512. 512 mod289: 289*1=289, 512-289=223. So, 8^3≡223 mod289.

So, 4*223*(17k) mod289: 4*223=892. 892*(17k) mod289.

But 17k mod289 is 17k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 4*8^3*(17k) mod289.

I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's compute each term step by step.

Compute 4*8^3*(17k):

8^3=512.

512 mod289: 512-289=223. So, 8^3≡223 mod289.

4*223=892. 892 mod289: 289*3=867. 892-867=25. So, 4*8^3≡25 mod289.

So, 4*8^3*(17k)≡25*(17k) mod289.

25*17=425. 425 mod289: 425-289=136. So, 25*17k≡136k mod289.

So, this term is 136k mod289.

Next term:6*8^2*(17k)^2.

8^2=64.

6*64=384.

(17k)^2=289k^2. But 289k^2≡0 mod289. So, 6*8^2*(17k)^2≡0 mod289.

Third term is 0.

Third term:4*8*(17k)^3.

(17k)^3=17^3k^3=4913k^3. 4913 mod289: 289*17=4913, so 17^3=289*17, so 4913k^3≡0 mod289.

So, this term is 0.

Fourth term: (17k)^4=17^4k^4=83521k^4. 83521 mod289: 289*288=8352, so 83521=289*288 +1. So, 83521k^4≡1*k^4 mod289. So, this term is k^4 mod289.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have miscalculated here. Let me check:

(17k)^4 = (17^4)k^4. 17^2=289, so 17^4=(17^2)^2=289^2. So, 289^2 mod289 is 0. Therefore, (17k)^4≡0 mod289. So, this term is 0.

Wait, no, because (17k)^4=17^4k^4= (289)^2 k^4, which is 0 mod289.

So, the only terms that contribute are the first and the second.

So, (8 +17k)^4 ≡50 +136k mod289.

We set this equal to -1 mod289, which is 288.

So,

50 +136k ≡288 mod289.

Subtract 50:

136k ≡238 mod289.

Now, we need to solve for k: 136k ≡238 mod289.

Find the inverse of136 mod289.

Compute GCD(136,289):

289 ÷136 =2, remainder=289-2*136=289-272=17.

136 ÷17=8, remainder 0. So, GCD is17.

Wait, but 238 is 238 ÷17=14, so 238=17*14.

136=17*8.

So, 17*8*k ≡17*14 mod289.

Divide both sides by17: 8k≡14 mod(289/17)=17.

So, 8k≡14 mod17.

Now, solve 8k≡14 mod17.

Multiply both sides by inverse of8 mod17.

What's the inverse of8 mod17? Find x such that8x≡1 mod17.

Try x=15:8*15=120≡120-7*17=120-119=1 mod17. So, inverse is15.

So, k≡14*15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204. 210-204=6. So, k≡6 mod17.

So, the solutions for k are k=6 +17t, where t is integer.

We need the smallest positive k, so t=0 gives k=6.

Therefore, k=6 is the smallest positive integer solution.

Therefore, m=8 +17k=8 +17*6=8+102=110.

So, m=110 is the minimal positive integer such that m^4 +1 is divisible by289=17^2.

Let me verify this:

Compute 110^4 mod289.

110^2=12,100. 12,100 ÷289: 289*41=11,849. 12,100-11,849=251. So, 110^2≡251 mod289.

Then, 110^4=(251)^2=63,001.

Compute 63,001 ÷289:

Compute 289*217=289*(200 +17)=57,800 +4,913=62,713.

63,001 -62,713=288. So, 63,001≡288 mod289.

Which is -1 mod289. So, yes, 110^4 ≡-1 mod289.

So, m=110 is the minimal positive integer satisfying the condition.


To solve the problem, we first need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). This requires \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \).

1. **Identifying the Prime \( p \):**
   - We start by checking primes where \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution. For such primes, \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) is necessary because the multiplicative group modulo \( p \) must have an element of order 8.
   - Checking primes sequentially, we find that \( p = 17 \) is the smallest prime where \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \) has a solution. Specifically, \( 8^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \).

2. **Lifting the Solution to \( p^2 = 289 \):**
   - Using Hensel's lemma, we lift the solution \( x \equiv 8 \mod 17 \) to modulo \( 289 \). We express \( m = 8 + 17k \) and find the smallest \( k \) such that \( m^4 \equiv -1 \mod 289 \).
   - Expanding \( (8 + 17k)^4 \) modulo \( 289 \) and simplifying, we derive the equation \( 136k \equiv 238 \mod 289 \).
   - Solving this congruence, we find \( k \equiv 6 \mod 17 \). The smallest positive \( k \) is 6.

3. **Finding the Least \( m \):**
   - Substituting \( k = 6 \) into \( m = 8 + 17k \), we get \( m = 110 \).
   - Verifying, \( 110^4 \equiv -1 \mod 289 \), confirming that \( m = 110 \) is indeed the smallest such integer.

Thus, the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is **110**.

\boxed{110}
