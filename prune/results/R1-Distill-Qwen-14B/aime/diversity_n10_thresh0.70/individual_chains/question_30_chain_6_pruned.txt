Okay, so I've been given this problem: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all the distinct 13th roots of unity. So, they satisfy the equation x^13 - 1 = 0, but ω ≠ 1, so we can factor out (x - 1) and get the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But I'm not sure how that helps yet. Let me look at the product: it's from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So each term is a function of ω^k. Maybe I can find a way to express this product in terms of polynomials evaluated at certain points.

Wait, perhaps I can consider each term as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k: let's set x = ω^k, so each term becomes x² - 2x + 2.

So the product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2), where x = ω^k. But ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the 13th roots of unity. So this product is the product over all 13th roots of unity x of (x² - 2x + 2). But x = 1 is also a 13th root of unity, so when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so one of the terms is (1² - 2*1 + 2) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1.

Wait, but the problem says ω ≠ 1, but in the product, when k=0, it's 1. Oh, but the product is from k=0 to 12, including k=0, so it includes x=1. Hmm, I wonder if that's correct.

But let's proceed. So the product over all 13th roots x of (x² - 2x + 2). I know that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all roots x of (x - a) is related to Φ_n(a). But here, it's (x² - 2x + 2), not (x - a). Maybe I can factor this quadratic.

Wait, x² - 2x + 2 can be written as (x - 1)^2 + 1, but perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's find its roots. The quadratic equation x² - 2x + 2 = 0 has solutions x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i.

So we can factor x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So the product over all x (13th roots) of (x² - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all x (13th roots) of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

But the product over all x (13th roots) of (x - a) is equal to Φ_13(a), where Φ_13 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. Wait, Φ_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots of unity, so Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So if a is not a 13th root of unity, then the product over x (13th roots) of (x - a) is Φ_13(a) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1.

But in our case, a is (1 + i) and (1 - i). Wait, but (1 + i) is not a 13th root of unity, because |1 + i| is sqrt(2), which is not 1. So the product over x (13th roots) of (x - a) is Φ_13(a), right? So the product over x (13th roots) of (x - (1 + i)) is Φ_13(1 + i), and similarly for (1 - i).

So putting it all together, the product over x (13th roots) of (x² - 2x + 2) is equal to Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i).

So, our original product is Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i). So now I need to compute Φ_13(a) where a is 1 + i and 1 - i.

Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So Φ_13(a) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1.

Hmm, calculating this for a = 1 + i. Let me note that 1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, so its powers can be calculated using De Moivre's theorem.

Let me compute Φ_13(1 + i):

First, compute (1 + i)^13. Since (1 + i)^2 = 2i, (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4, (1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16. Then (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 +
