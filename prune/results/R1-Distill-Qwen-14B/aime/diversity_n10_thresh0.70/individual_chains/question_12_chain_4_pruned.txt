Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits. Each cell will have a digit, and when I read the numbers left to right in each row, their sum should be 999. Also, when I read the numbers top to bottom in each column, their sum should be 99. The example they gave is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

Which works because 0 + 991 = 991, but wait, that's 0 + 991 = 991, which isn't 999. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, no, actually, the two numbers formed by reading left to right are 008 and 991. Wait, 008 is just 8, and 991 is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999, right? Yeah, that makes sense. And then for the columns, each column is read top to bottom, so 0 and 9, which is 09, and 0 and 9 is 09, and 8 and 1 is 81. So adding those: 09 + 09 + 81. But 09 is 9, so 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Okay, that works.

So I need to find how many such grids exist.

Let me visualize the grid:

a b c
d e f

So the first row is a three-digit number: 100a + 10b + c.

The second row is another three-digit number: 100d + 10e + f.

Their sum is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

So that equation is 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Which can be rewritten as 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly, for the columns, each column is read top to bottom as a two-digit number. So the first column is 10a + d, the second column is 10b + e, the third column is 10c + f. Their sum is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So that's 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

We can rearrange this as 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So now I have two equations:

1) 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

2) 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, maybe I can find variables for the sums. Let's let S = a + d, T = b + e, U = c + f. Then equation 1 becomes 100S + 10T + U = 999.

Similarly, equation 2 can be manipulated. Let me think. Let me denote V = a + b + c, W = d + e + f. Then equation 2 is 10V + W = 99.

But from equation 1, 100S + 10T + U = 999.

So S, T, U are each sums of two digits. Since each digit is between 0 and 9, S = a + d can be from 0 to 18, same for T and U.

Similarly, V = a + b + c can be from 0 to 27, and W = d + e + f can be from 0 to 27.

But equation 2 is 10V + W = 99. So 10V + W = 99.

Since V and W are integers, V must be 9 and W must be 9, because 10*9 +9=99. Because if V were 8, W would have to be 19, which is impossible since W is the sum of three digits, each at most 9, so W â‰¤ 27, but 19 is possible, but let's see.

Wait, wait, actually, 10V + W =99. So V can be from 0 to 9, since 10*10=100 which
