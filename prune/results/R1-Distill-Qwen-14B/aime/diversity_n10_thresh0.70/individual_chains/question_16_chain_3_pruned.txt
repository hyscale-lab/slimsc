Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p, right? Because n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, so squaring both sides gives n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That suggests that the order of n modulo p divides 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be a divisor of 4. So the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 divides p-1 because the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So p must be 1 mod 8.

Wait, but the question is about p² dividing n⁴ + 1. So I need primes p where not only does p divide n⁴ + 1, but p² does as well. I think this has something to do with higher order congruences.

I remember that for primes where -1 is a quartic residue, which would be primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8, since the multiplicative group has order p-1, and 4 divides p-1 for -1 to be a square (quadratic residue), but for quartic residues, maybe it's more stringent. Wait, maybe it's when 8 divides p-1.

But wait, let's think about specific primes. The primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 97, etc. Wait, but maybe the smallest prime is 17? Or is it smaller?

Wait, let me check smaller primes first. The primes less than 17 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

Let me test each prime to see if n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p² for some n.

Starting with p=2: Let's see. n⁴ +1 for n=1: 2, which is 2²=4? No, 2 is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which is not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 82 divided by 4 is 20.5, not integer. So p=2 doesn't work.

p=3: Let's see n⁴ +1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8.

n=1: 1 +1=2 mod9. Not 0.

n=2: 16+1=17 mod9= -1. Not 0.

n=3: 81 +1=82 mod9=1. Not 0.

n=4: (256 +1)=257 mod9: 257 /9 is 28*9=252, 257-252=5. So 5 mod9.

n=5: 625 +1=626. 626 mod9: 6+2+6=14, 1+4=5. 626 mod9=5.

Wait, maybe I should compute n^4 mod9:

n=1: 1

n=2: 16 mod9=7

n=3: 0

n=4: (4^2)^2=16^2=256 mod9: 256 /9=28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9.

n=4: 256 mod9=4.
