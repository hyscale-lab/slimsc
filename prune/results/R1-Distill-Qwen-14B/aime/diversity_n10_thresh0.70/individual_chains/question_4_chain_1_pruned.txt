Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, meaning Bob can always win no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

So, the first step is to figure out for each n, whether it's a winning or losing position. Since Alice goes first, if n is a winning position, Alice can win. If n is a losing position, then Bob can win.

Therefore, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case would be n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move and thus loses. Wait, but in this problem, taking the last token wins, so n=0 would mean the previous player has already taken the last token and wins. So maybe I should adjust my thinking.

Wait, no. When n=0, the game is over, so the player who just moved has won. So for n=0, it's like the end state. So for n=1, the player can take 1 token and win, so n=1 is a winning position. Similarly, n=4 is a winning position because the player can take all 4 tokens and win.

What about n=2? The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, can the player take 4 tokens? No, because there are only 2. So the only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So n=2 is an L.

Wait,
