Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem says:

"Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB·AC."

Hmm. So, we have triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. Also, the line IA is perpendicular to OI. I need to find the product of sides AB and AC.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, which seems like a specific condition. I need to figure out how this affects the triangle.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Yes, I think that's the formula. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Let me verify that. So, OI² = R² - 2Rr. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Let me calculate OI.

Given R = 13 and r = 6,

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6
= 169 - 156
= 13

So, OI = sqrt(13). 

Interesting. So, OI is sqrt(13). Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees.

Wait, so in triangle OIA, we have:

OI = sqrt(13), IA = r = 6, and OA = R = 13.

Wait, but wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, in triangle OIA, sides are OI = sqrt(13), IA = 6, OA = 13. And it's right-angled at I. So, according to Pythagoras:

OI² + IA² =
