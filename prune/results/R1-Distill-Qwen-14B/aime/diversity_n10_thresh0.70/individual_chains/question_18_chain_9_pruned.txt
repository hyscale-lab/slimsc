Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. Each side is equal, and each internal angle is the same too. The problem says that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So the rectangles are formed by connecting these sides or diagonals.

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a large number of sides like a dodecagon, there are a lot of symmetries and diagonals. So, to form a rectangle, I need four points (vertices) that form a rectangle. In a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the opposite sides are parallel and equal, and the diagonals are equal and bisect each other.

Wait, but how do I ensure that the sides of the rectangle lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon? Maybe I should think about the coordinates of the vertices. Let me imagine a regular dodecagon inscribed in a unit circle. Each vertex can be represented with coordinates (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of vectors or steps between vertices. Since it's a regular dodecagon, the vertices are equally spaced around a circle. The key is that the sides of the rectangle must lie on the edges or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle must be straight lines connecting two vertices (either adjacent or non-adjacent, i.e., diagonals).

Wait, but a rectangle requires opposite sides to be equal and parallel, and the adjacent sides to be perpendicular. So, the vectors representing the sides should satisfy certain conditions.

Let me denote the vertices as V0, V1, V2, ..., V11, going around the dodecagon. The idea is to choose four vertices such that they form a rectangle. So, for each rectangle, there are two pairs of opposite sides, and each pair is congruent and parallel.

I think a good approach might be to consider the vectors between the points. For a rectangle, if I have points A, B, C, D in order, then vector AB should be equal and perpendicular to vector AD. So, perhaps if I can find all such
