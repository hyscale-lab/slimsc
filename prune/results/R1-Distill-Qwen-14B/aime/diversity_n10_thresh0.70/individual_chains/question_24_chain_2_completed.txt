Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

We have a list of positive integers with three properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. I'll start by recalling some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

First, the mode of a list of numbers is the number that appears most frequently. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. So, I need to make sure that 9 is the most frequent number, and no other number can have the same frequency as 9.

Next, the median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting. So if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers, which must result in an integer not present in the list. Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which isn't in the list? Wait, that can't be. Because the median, if it's the middle number, would have to be in the list, right? So, that suggests that the list must have an even number of elements. Because if it's even, the median is the average of two middle numbers, which doesn't have to be in the list.

So, first conclusion: the list has an even number of elements. Let me note that down.

Let me represent the number of elements as n. So n is even. Let's say n=2k, where k is an integer. Then, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements when the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements must be an integer, and that integer isn't present in the list.

Wait, but if the average is an integer, then the sum of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements must be even. So, they must both be even or both be odd. But since the sum is 30, maybe that's something to consider.

Let me also think about the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if another number appears, say, twice, then 9 must appear at least three times. If another number appears once, 9 can appear twice, but since it's the unique mode, it must have a higher frequency than any other number.

Wait, but if all other numbers appear once, then 9 can appear twice. But let me think, is that possible?

Wait, no, because if 9 appears twice and every other number appears once, then 9 is the mode, but that's only if other numbers don't have the same count. But if 9 appears twice, and another number also appears twice, then 9 is not the unique mode. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number.

So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times. If another number appears once, 9 can appear twice.

But wait, in our case, the list has to sum up to 30. So, the more 9s we have, the fewer the sum contributed by other numbers.

So, perhaps the list contains several 9s and other numbers that are either less than 9 or greater than 9.

Wait, but since the median is a positive integer not in the list, and the list is in order, the median is between the two middle numbers. So, if the median is an integer not present, then the two middle numbers must average to that integer, and that integer isn't in the list.

Let me consider possible scenarios. Let's suppose n is 8. So, n=8. Then, the median would be the average of the 4th and 5th elements. So, if I have a list of 8 numbers, sorted as a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ a4 ≤ a5 ≤ a6 ≤ a7 ≤ a8.

The median is (a4 + a5)/2, which is an integer not present in the list. Let's denote this median as m, so m = (a4 + a5)/2, and m is not in the list.

Also, the sum of all a_i is 30.

And 9 is the unique mode. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number.

Let me think about how many 9s there could be.

If n=8, then the maximum frequency any number can have is 4 (since 4 is half of 8, but for unique mode, it needs to have more than any other number). Wait, no, in n=8, if a number appears 4 times, it's the mode, but another number could also appear 4 times, making it not unique. So, to have a unique mode, 9 must appear at least 5 times? Because in that case, no other number can appear more than 4 times, but 5 is more than 4. Wait, no, in n=8, if 9 appears 4 times, another number can also appear 4 times, so the mode wouldn't be unique. So, to have a unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, if the maximum frequency of any other number is 3, then 9 needs to appear at least 4 times. But wait, if 9 appears 4 times, another number could also appear 4 times, making it bimodal. So, to have a unique mode, 9 must appear at least 5 times.

Wait, because if 9 appears 4 times, and another number appears 4 times, then 9 is not a unique mode. So, 9 must appear more than any other number. So, maybe 9 appears 5 times, and the others appear at most 4 times. But wait, in n=8, if 9 appears 5 times, then the remaining 3 numbers must be other numbers, each appearing once or something else.

Wait, let's see. If n=8, and 9 appears 5 times, then the total sum contributed by 9s is 5*9=45. But the total sum is 30, which is less than 45. That's impossible. So, n cannot be 8.

Wait, hold on. So, if n is 8, and 9 appears 5 times, that's 45, which exceeds the total sum of 30. So that's impossible. So, 9 cannot appear 5 times if n=8.

So maybe n is smaller? Wait, let's think again.

Wait, perhaps n is smaller than 8. Let me think about possible n values.

Wait, n has to be even since the median is not in the list, as discussed earlier. So possible even n values could be 2,4,6,8,10,... but considering the sum is 30, n can't be too large.

Wait, for n=2: sum is 30, so two numbers, both 15. But the mode has to be 9, but 15 appears twice, 9 doesn't appear. So that's impossible.

n=4: four numbers. The sum is 30, so average is 7.5. So, possible numbers. But the mode is 9, which must appear more than any other number.

Wait, 9 can appear twice. Then, the other two numbers must be different or same, but not more than two.

But let's see: if 9 appears twice, the other two numbers could be, say, a and b, with a ≤ b ≤9 or a and b ≥9.

But the sum would be 9+9+a+b=18+a+b=30, so a+b=12.

But the median would be (a2 + a3)/2. Wait, n=4, so median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements.

If the list is sorted, suppose it's [x, y, 9, 9], then the median is (y + 9)/2. That needs to be an integer not in the list.

So, (y +9)/2 must be an integer, say m. So, y +9 = 2m. Also, y must be ≤9 because the list is sorted.

So, m must be an integer, and y = 2m -9.

But y must be a positive integer, so 2m -9 ≥1 → m ≥5.

Also, since y must be ≤9, 2m -9 ≤9 → 2m ≤18 → m ≤9.

So, m can be from 5 to 9.

But m must not be present in the list. The list is [x, y, 9,9].

So, if m is 5, then y=2*5 -9=1. So, y=1.

So, the list becomes [x,1,9,9]. But x must be ≤1. Since all numbers are positive integers, x can be 1.

So, the list is [1,1,9,9]. Sum is 1+1+9+9=20, which is less than 30. So that doesn't work.

Wait, but I had a+b=12, where a and b are the other two numbers, which in this case are x and y.

Wait, if the list is [x, y, 9,9], then x + y +9 +9 =30 → x+y=12.

In the case where m=5, y=1, so x would be 11. Because x +1=12 → x=11.

So, the list would be [11,1,9,9], but wait, that's not sorted. It should be [1,9,9,11]. So, the two middle numbers are 9 and 9, so the median is (9+9)/2=9. But 9 is in the list. Wait, but the problem states that the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, that's a problem. So, m=9 would be in the list, which violates the condition.

Wait, let's go back to m=5. Then y=1, x=11. So the list is [1,11,9,9]. Wait, no, that's not sorted. Sorted, it's [1,9,9,11]. So the two middle numbers are 9 and 9. So the median is 9, which is in the list. That's a problem because the median must not be in the list.

So, m=5 is not acceptable.

Next, m=6. Then y=2*6 -9=3. So, y=3. Then, x=12 -3=9. So the list would be [9,3,9,9], but when sorted, it's [3,9,9,9]. Wait, that's four numbers: 3,9,9,9. But then the sum is 3+9+9+9=30, which works. Wait, but in this case, the mode is 9, which appears three times, and 3 appears once. So, unique mode is 9. That's good.

What's the median? For n=4, it's (a2 +a3)/2. The sorted list is [3,9,9,9]. So a2=9 and a3=9. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is present in the list. But the problem says the median is not present. So, that's a problem. So m=6 is invalid.

Next, m=7. Then y=2*7 -9=5. So y=5. Then x=12 -5=7. So the list is [5,7,9,9], but when sorted, it's [5,7,9,9]. The sum is 5+7+9+9=30. The median is (7+9)/2=8. Is 8 in the list? No. So that works.

Wait, let's check the mode. 9 appears twice, 5 appears once, 7 appears once. So, mode is 9, which is unique. So, this seems to work.

So, the list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum is 5+7+9+9=30. Median is 8, not in the list. Mode is 9, unique. So that fits all conditions.

Wait, but wait, 9 appears twice. Are there any other numbers that appear twice? 5 and 7 appear once. So, 9 is the unique mode. That's correct.

So, for n=4, this seems to work. So the list is [5,7,9,9], sorted as [5,7,9,9].

So, the sum of squares would be 5² +7² +9² +9²=25 +49 +81 +81= 25+49=74; 81+81=162; 74+162=236.

Wait, but is this the only possible case?

Let me check m=8. So m=8, then y=2*8 -9=7. So y=7. Then x=12 -7=5. So the list becomes [5,7,9,9], which is the same as before. So, same result.

m=9: y=2*9 -9=9. So y=9. Then x=12 -9=3. So the list is [3,9,9,9], which when sorted is [3,9,9,9]. But as before, the median is 9, which is in the list. So it's invalid.

So for n=4, only m=7 and m=8 give valid lists, but they result in the same list.

Wait, but when m=7, the median is 8, which is not in the list. So that's valid. So, this seems to satisfy all the conditions.

But wait, could there be a list with more 9s?

Wait, in n=4, if 9 appears three times, would that work?

So, let's say the list is [x,9,9,9]. The sum is x +9+9+9= x+27=30 → x=3.

So, the sorted list is [3,9,9,9]. Then, the median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. So that's invalid.

So, n=4, the only valid list is [5,7,9,9], with sum of squares 236.

Wait, but let me check if n=6 is possible.

n=6: sum is 30. So, the numbers are a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6.

Median is (a3 +a4)/2, which is an integer not in the list.

Also, 9 must be the unique mode.

So, let's think about how many 9s there can be.

In n=6, to have a unique mode, 9 must appear more than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times. If another number appears once, 9 can appear twice, but it's the mode.

Wait, but if 9 appears twice, and other numbers appear once, then 9 is the mode, but it's only appearing twice. But since it's the mode, that's acceptable as long as no other number appears more than once.

Wait, but in that case, 9 appears twice, and the other numbers appear once each.

So, let's see: if 9 appears twice, then the remaining four numbers must sum to 30 - 18=12, and all other numbers appear once.

But in such a case, the list would have 6 numbers: two 9s and four distinct numbers that sum to 12.

But let's think about the median.

For n=6, the median is (a3 +a4)/2. Since the median is an integer not in the list, this average must be an integer not present.

Let me try constructing such a list.

Let me say 9 appears twice. So, the two 9s would be in positions a5 and a6, perhaps, or a4 and a5. Wait, but if the list is sorted, the 9s might be in the middle.

Wait, let's think. Let's say the list is [a, b, c, d, e, f], sorted in non-decreasing order.

If 9 is the mode, and it appears twice, then other numbers can appear at most once.

So, the two 9s could be in positions, say, d and e. Then, a, b, c are ≤9, and f ≥9.

Wait, but if 9 is in d and e, then c could be 9 as well, but that would make three 9s, which is more than two.

Wait, no, in this case, 9 appears twice, so only two positions. So, perhaps a, b, c are less than 9, and d and e are 9, and f is greater than 9.

Wait, but then the sum is a + b + c +9 +9 +f=30 → a + b + c + f=12.

But a, b, c are positive integers, each ≤9, and f is ≥9.

Wait, but a, b, c are each at least 1, so 1+1+1=3, which leaves f=9. But f must be ≥9, so f=9.

So, a + b + c =3. The only way is a=1, b=1, c=1.

So, the list becomes [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Wait, but 9 appears three times, not two. So that's a problem because I intended 9 to appear twice. So, that approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the two 9s are in different positions.

Wait, perhaps let's have a, b, c, d ≤9, and e, f≥9.

But then, if 9 appears twice, then e and f would have to be 9. So, e=9, f=9.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d,9,9]. The sum is a + b + c + d +9 +9=30 → a + b + c + d=12.

Each of a, b, c, d is ≤9, and they can be same or different.

To have 9 as the unique mode, no other number can appear more than once. So, a, b, c, d must all be distinct, or appear once.

Wait, but 9 appears twice, so if any other number appears twice, 9 would not be the unique mode. So, a, b, c, d must all be distinct and each appear once.

So, a, b, c, d are four distinct positive integers summing to 12.

What's the minimum sum of four distinct positive integers? 1+2+3+4=10. So, 10 is the minimum. So, 12 is possible.

So, possible sets for a, b, c, d are permutations of [1,2,3,6], [1,2,4,5], etc.

But let's pick one. Let's say a=1, b=2, c=3, d=6. Then, the list is [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Let's check if the median is an integer not in the list.

The median is (a3 +a4)/2 = (3 +6)/2 = 4.5. That's not an integer, so it doesn't satisfy the condition. So, this list doesn't work.

Another option: a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5. So the list is [1,2,4,5,9,9]. The median is (4 +5)/2=4.5, again not an integer.

Hmm, maybe another combination. Let's try a=1, b=3, c=4, d=4. But then d=4 appears twice, which would make 4 appear twice, same as 9. So, 9 is not the unique mode. So that's invalid.

Wait, another combination: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=6. Sum is 12. That's the same as before.

Alternatively, a=2, b=3, c=4, d=3. But that would have 3 appearing twice, which is invalid.

Wait, maybe a=1, b=2, c=5, d=4. Sum is 1+2+5+4=12. So list is [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Then median is (4 +5)/2=4.5, not integer.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's think of a, b, c, d such that their sum is 12, all distinct, and (c +d) is even so that (c +d)/2 is integer.

Because the median is (c +d)/2, and it's an integer, so c +d must be even.

So, c and d must be both even or both odd.

So, let's try to find a, b, c, d such that a < b < c < d, all distinct, sum to 12, and c +d is even.

Let me try different combinations.

Possible four distinct numbers summing to 12:

1,2,3,6: sum is 12.

c=3, d=6. 3+6=9, which is odd. So, median 4.5, not integer.

1,2,4,5: sum 12. c=4, d=5. 4+5=9, odd. Median 4.5.

1,3,4,4: duplicate, invalid.

2,3,4,3: duplicate, invalid.

Wait, what about 2,2,3,5? Duplicate 2s, mode becomes 2 and 5? No, 9 is supposed to be unique mode.

Wait, maybe 1,1,5,5: duplicates, but 9 appears twice; mode is 1 and 5, which conflicts.

Alternatively, maybe 3,3,3,3: but that would make 3 the mode, not 9.

Hmm, perhaps no such list exists with n=6 where 9 is the unique mode, the median is an integer not in the list, and the sum is 30.

Wait, maybe I can try to have 9 appear three times.

If 9 appears three times in n=6, then the remaining three numbers must sum to 30 - 27=3.

So, three numbers sum to 3, each at least 1. The only possibility is 1,1,1. So, the list would have three 9s and three 1s.

So, the list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Sorted.

The median is (a3 +a4)/2 = (1 +9)/2=5, which is an integer not in the list. So that's acceptable.

Now, check the mode: 9 appears three times, 1 appears three times as well. So, both 9 and 1 are modes. But the problem states that the mode is unique. So, this is bimodal, which violates the condition. So, this is invalid.

So, that approach doesn't work either.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears four times in n=6. Then, the sum would be 4*9=36, which is more than 30. So, that's impossible.

Wait, so perhaps n=6 is impossible because we can't have 9 as the unique mode without either having the median in the list or having bimodal distribution.

So, perhaps n=4 is the only possible case.

Wait, but let's think about n=5. Wait, n has to be even, as we discussed earlier, because the median is not in the list, so n must be even. Because if n is odd, the median is the middle number, which is in the list, violating the condition. So, n must be even, and for n=4 and n=6, we saw that n=4 works, but n=6 doesn't.

Wait, let me double-check n=4.

Earlier, I found the list [5,7,9,9], which sums to 30, has mode 9 (appears twice), and median 8, which is not in the list. That works.

But wait, is there another possible list for n=4? Let me see.

Suppose n=4, and 9 appears three times. Then, the fourth number is 30 - 27=3. So, the list would be [3,9,9,9]. Sorted. The median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list, so invalid.

Alternatively, 9 appears twice, and other numbers once.

Wait, but earlier, the sum had to be 30, so 9 appears twice (18), and the other two numbers sum to 12. The list could be [1,11,9,9], but when sorted, it's [1,9,9,11], with median (9+9)/2=9, which is present, invalid. But when I considered the median as 8, I had [5,7,9,9], which worked.

So, that's the only valid list for n=4.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the list has 9 appearing twice, and other numbers arranged such that the median is an integer not present.

Wait, let's consider the list [4,8,9,9]. Sum is 4+8+9+9=30. Sorted, it's [4,8,9,9]. Median is (8+9)/2=8.5, which is not integer. So, invalid.

Another list: [6,6,9,9]. Sum is 6+6+9+9=30. But mode is 6 and 9, both appearing twice. So, not unique mode. Invalid.

How about [2,10,9,9]. Sum is 2+10+9+9=30. Sorted: [2,9,9,10]. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is present. Invalid.

Another try: [3,9,9,9] sum 30? 3+9+9+9=30. So yes, but as before, the median is 9, present. Invalid.

So, seems like the only valid list is [5,7,9,9], sum of squares 25+49+81+81=236.

Wait, but let me check if there's another list with different numbers.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the list has more than four elements, but n=6 didn't work, as I saw earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering n=6. Let me try again.

If n=6, 9 appears twice, and other numbers appear once.

Sum of other numbers: 30 - 18=12.

So, four numbers summing to 12, each appearing once.

Wait, perhaps two numbers are 2 and 10, but 2+10=12, but then the list would be [2,10,9,9, a, b], but that's six numbers, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, n=6, so we have two 9s, and four other numbers, each appearing once, summing to 12.

So, possible four numbers: 1,2,3,6 (sum 12). So the list is [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Sorted, [1,2,3,6,9,9].

Median is (3+6)/2=4.5, not integer. So, invalid.

Another combination: 1,2,4,5. Sum 12. So list is [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Sorted. Median is (4+5)/2=4.5, not integer.

Another combination: 1,3,4,4. But duplicates, so 4 appears twice, same as 9. Not unique mode.

Wait, perhaps 1,1,5,5. But then 1 and 5 appear twice, same as 9. So, mode is not unique.

Hmm, maybe it's impossible for n=6.

Wait, perhaps 9 appears three times. Then, sum of other three numbers would be 30 - 27=3. So, three numbers each 1. So list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. But as before, median is (1+9)/2=5, which is integer not in the list. But the mode is both 1 and 9, which are tied. So, invalid.

So, n=6 doesn't seem to work.

Wait, another thought: perhaps 9 appears four times. Then, sum is 4*9=36, which is more than 30. Impossible.

So, n=4 seems to be the only possible case.

Thus, the list is [5,7,9,9], sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25+49+81+81=236.

Wait, but let me check if there are other possibilities for n=4.

Another possible list: [4,8,9,9]. Sum is 4+8+9+9=30. Sorted: [4,8,9,9]. Median is (8+9)/2=8.5, not integer. So invalid.

Another possibility: [6,6,9,9]. Sum is 30. But mode is 6 and 9, both appearing twice. So, not unique mode.

Another list: [2,10,9,9]. Sorted: [2,9,9,10]. Median is 9, present. Invalid.

Another list: [3,9,9,9]. Sum is 30, median is 9, present. Invalid.

Another list: [1,11,9,9]. Sorted: [1,9,9,11]. Median is 9, present. Invalid.

So, the only valid list for n=4 is [5,7,9,9], which gives the sum of squares as 236.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me think about n=2.

n=2: two numbers summing to 30. The mode has to be 9, so both numbers must be 9. But 9+9=18≠30. So, impossible.

So, n=4 is the only possible case.

Therefore, the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25+49=74, plus 81+81=162. 74+162=236.

Wait, but let me compute 5²:25, 7²:49, 9²:81. So, 25+49=74, 81+81=162. 74+162=236.

Yes, that's correct.


The problem requires finding a list of positive integers with the following properties:

1. The sum of the list is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer not present in the list.

To satisfy these conditions, we analyze possible list lengths and configurations.

### Key Steps:

1. **Mode Constraint**: Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. This means 9 must appear at least twice, and no other number can appear the same number of times.

2. **Median Constraint**: The median must be an integer not present in the list. This implies the list must have an even number of elements because the median of an even-length list is the average of the two middle numbers, which doesn't have to be in the list.

3. **Sum Constraint**: The total sum of the list is 30.

### Analysis of Possible List Lengths:

- **n=2**: Impossible, as two 9s would sum to 18, leaving 12 for another number, but the mode would not be unique.
- **n=4**: Possible. Let's explore this case.
  - Let the list be `[a, b, 9, 9]` with `a ≤ b ≤ 9`.
  - The sum is `a + b + 9 + 9 = 30` → `a + b = 12`.
  - The median is `(b + 9)/2`, which must be an integer not in the list.
  - Testing values:
    - If `b=7`, then `a=5`. The list is `[5, 7, 9, 9]`.
    - The median is `(7 + 9)/2 = 8`, which is not in the list.
    - Mode: 9 appears twice, others appear once. Unique mode satisfied.

- **n=6**: Impossible. Either the mode is not unique, the median is in the list, or the sum constraints cannot be met.

### Conclusion:

The only valid list is `[5, 7, 9, 9]`. The sum of the squares of its elements is:

\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]

**Answer**: \boxed{236}
