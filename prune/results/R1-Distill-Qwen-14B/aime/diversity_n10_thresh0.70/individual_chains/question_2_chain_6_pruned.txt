Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. It seems a bit involved, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, we have points O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. We need to find a point C on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. Then, we have to find OC² expressed as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.

First, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. Point A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and point B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB connects these two points.

The family F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1 unit. So, each segment PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between them is 1.

The equation for the distance between P(p,0) and Q(0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Squaring both sides, we get p² + q² = 1. So, for each segment PQ, the coordinates (p, q) satisfy this equation.

Now, the problem states that all these segments PQ lie in the first quadrant. So, p and q are non-negative, which they already are since we're in the first quadrant.

We are to find a point C on AB, not equal to A or B, which is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, point C is unique in that sense. So, essentially, AB is part of the family F, but other segments from F might intersect AB at some point C, but we need a point C that is only on AB and no other PQ from F.

Wait, actually, the problem says that C is on AB and does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, C is a point on AB that is only on AB and not on any other PQ in F.

So, our task is to find such a point C and compute OC².

Alright, let me think about the parametrization of AB. Let's find the equation of segment AB.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of line AB can be written as y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Let's check that: when x = 0, y = -sqrt(3)*(-1/2) = sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. When x = 1/2, y = 0, which is point A. That's correct.

So, parametric equations for AB can be given by:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t
y = 0 + sqrt(3)/2 * t

where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we're at A(1/2, 0), and when t=1, we're at B(0, sqrt(3)/2).

So, a general point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - (1/2)t, sqrt(3)/2 * t) for some t between 0 and 1.

But wait, maybe it's better to parameterize AB with a parameter s, say from 0 to 1, where s=0 is at A and s=1 is at B.

So, let me write AB as:

x = (1/2)(1 - s)
y = (sqrt(3)/2)s

where s ∈ [0,1].

So, point C will be ( (1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s ) for some s between 0 and 1, not equal to 0 or 1.

Now, we need to find such a C that is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, suppose there is another segment PQ in F (i.e., PQ has length 1, P on x-axis, Q on y-axis) such that C is on PQ. We need to find s such that C is not on any other PQ except AB.

So, perhaps we can set up the
