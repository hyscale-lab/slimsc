Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. An equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length, right? So each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA are all the same length, let's say 's'. 

The problem also mentions that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. That structure reminds me of a regular hexagon, but since it's just equilateral and not necessarily regular, the angles might not all be equal. But because opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon might have some symmetry.

Next, the problem talks about a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length 's' of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. So, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Let me sketch this mentally. Since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, and the hexagon is convex, extending these sides should form a triangle that's larger than the hexagon itself.

I remember that in such hexagons with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of their sides form similar triangles. Maybe the triangle formed by AB, CD, EF is similar to the triangle formed by the extensions? Or perhaps the triangle in question is similar but scaled up.

Wait, the side lengths of the triangle are 200, 240, 300. Hmm, these numbers seem familiar. Let me check if they form a Pythagorean triple. 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300² is 90000. So, no, that's not a right triangle. Maybe it's just a scalene triangle.

I think I can use the properties of similar triangles here. If the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF is similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides, then their sides are proportional.

Wait, but how exactly does the triangle relate to the hexagon? Let me think. The sides AB, CD, EF are being extended, so the triangle is formed outside the hexagon. Perhaps the triangle is made by the intersections of these extended sides.

In a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF should meet at points that form this triangle. Let me denote the triangle as triangle XYZ, where X, Y, Z are the intersection points of the extensions.

Since AB is parallel to DE, and BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA, the hexagon is kind of a "stretched" shape, but maintaining equal side lengths. This setup is similar to a translation of sides, creating a larger triangle.

I think this is related to the concept of a triangle being divided into smaller similar triangles. Maybe the hexagon is like a centrally symmetric figure inside the larger triangle,
