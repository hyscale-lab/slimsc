Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. I'm given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. I need to find AP, which can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, let me visualize the problem. I have triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Since the triangle is inscribed in circle ω, ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, connecting A to D and extending it to meet ω again at P. 

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a common external point to a circle, their lengths are equal. So, since D is the point where the two tangents at B and C meet, DB and DC should be equal in length. That might come in handy later.

My plan is to find the length AP. Since AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P, maybe I can use some power of a point or properties related to cyclic quadrilaterals.

Wait, power of a point! That seems promising. The power of point D with respect to circle ω should be equal to DB² or DC² since DB and DC are tangent lengths. Also, since D lies on AD, and AD intersects ω at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω is also equal to DA * DP.

So, putting that together: DB² = DA * DP.

If I can find DB, DA, and DP, I can relate them somehow. But I don't know any of these lengths yet. Maybe I can find DB first.

But how? Let's think. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle with DB = DC. Also, the line BC is given as 9 units. Maybe I can find the distance from D to BC or use some triangle properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the coordinates of D by coordinate geometry. That might be a bit involved, but given the lengths, maybe it's doable.

Wait, maybe using coordinates would complicate things more. Let me try another approach.

I remember that in triangle ABC, the length of the tangent from a vertex can be found using the formula related to the semiperimeter and the circumradius. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right path. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle ABC is not a right-angled triangle, but given the sides 5, 9, 10, let me check if it is. Let's see: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10² = 100. So, no, it's not right-angled.

But maybe I can find the circumradius of triangle ABC. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle. So, I can compute Δ using Heron's formula.

Given sides a=5, b=9, c=10. Wait, actually, in standard notation, a, b, c are opposite to angles A, B, C, but perhaps I should just compute the area regardless. 

So, let's compute the semiperimeter first: s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, the area Δ is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[504]. Let me compute that. 504 factors into 16*31.5, wait. Wait, 504 is 16 * 31.5? No, wait: 16 * 31.5 is 504, but 31.5 is not an integer. Alternatively, 504 = 16 * 31.5, but that's not helpful. Let me factor 504:

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷ 2 = 126

126 ÷ 2 = 63

63 ÷ 3 = 21

21 ÷ 3 = 7

So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So sqrt(504) = 2^(3/2) * 3^(2/2) * 7^(1/2) = 2*sqrt(2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 6 * sqrt(14). Because sqrt(2*7)=sqrt(14). So Δ = 6√14.

Now, the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4Δ). So
