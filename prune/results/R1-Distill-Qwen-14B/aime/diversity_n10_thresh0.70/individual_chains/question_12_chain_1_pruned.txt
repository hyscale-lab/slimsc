Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits. Each cell will have a single digit. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. Also, when I read it top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so it has two rows and three columns. Let me label the cells as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, when I read left to right, the first row is the number abc, and the second row is def. The sum of these two three-digit numbers should be 999.

When I read top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is ad, the second column is be, and the third column is cf. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

Wait, let me make sure I understand. So, the grid has two rows and three columns. Each row, when read left to right, is a three-digit number, and the sum of these two numbers is 999. Each column, when read top to bottom, is a two-digit number, and the sum of these three numbers is 99.

Got it. So, I need to figure out how many ways I can assign digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9, I assume) such that:

1. The number ABC + DEF = 999, where ABC is 100a + 10b + c, and DEF is 100d + 10e + f.
2. The numbers AD, BE, CF add up to 99, where AD is 10a + d, BE is 10b + e, CF is 10c + f.

So, now I can write these as equations.

First equation:
ABC + DEF = 999
Which is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Second equation:
AD + BE + CF = 99
Which is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Hmm, so I have two equations with six variables. I need to find the number of integer solutions where each variable a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit (0-9, except the first digits a, d might have constraints because they are the first digit of a number, so a can't be zero? Wait, ABC is a three-digit number, so a can be zero? Wait, no. Wait, 0bc would be a two-digit number, but the problem says "numbers formed by reading left to right." Hmm, the example given starts with 0, so maybe leading zeros are allowed. Because in the example, the first number is 008, which is 8, and the second is 991, which adds up to 999.

So, okay, leading zeros are allowed. So a and d can be zero. So each of a, b, c, d, e, f can be digits from 0 to 9.

Alright, so let me write the two equations again.

Equation 1:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation 2:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate some variables.

Wait, let me compute equation 1 minus equation 2.

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(100a - 10a) + (10b - 10b) + (c - 10c) + (100d - d) + (10e - e) + (f - f) = 999 - 99.

Simplify:

90a + 0b -9c + 99d + 9e + 0f = 900.

So, 90a -9c +99d +9e =900.

I can factor out 9:

9(10a - c + 11d + e) =900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e =100.

Hmm, so:

10a - c + 11d + e =100.

That's one equation.

Now, let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others. Maybe express e in terms of the others.

e =100 -10a + c -11d.

But e has to be a digit, so 0 ≤ e ≤9.

So, 0 ≤100 -10a + c -11d ≤9.

Let me write that as:

100 -10a + c -11d ≥0,

and

100 -10a + c -11d ≤9.

So,

100 -10a + c -11d ≥0 → 10a - c +11d ≤100.

And,

100 -10a + c -11d ≤9 → 10a - c +11d ≥91.

So, combining these:

91 ≤10a -c +11d ≤100.

That's an important constraint.

Now, let's think about possible values for a, d, and c.

Since a, d, and c are digits (0-9), let's compute 10a -c +11d.

The minimum value is when a=0, d=0, c=9: 0 -9 +0= -9.

The maximum value is when a=9, d=9, c=0: 90 -0 +99= 189.

But in our case, it's 91 ≤ ... ≤100.

So, the expression 10a -c +11d must be between 91 and 100 inclusive.

So, 10a -c +11d is an integer between 91 and 100.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Let me denote S =10a -c +11d.

So, S is an integer between 91 and 100.

And e =100 - S.

Since e must be a digit, 0 ≤ e ≤9, which aligns because S ranges from 91 to 100, so 100 - S ranges from 0 to9.

So, e is determined once S is determined.

So, now, let's think about variables a, c, d.

We have:

S =10a -c +11d.

We can rewrite this as:

10a +11d -c = S.

Which can be rearranged as:

c =10a +11d - S.

But since c is a digit (0-9), 0 ≤c ≤9.

So,

0 ≤10a +11d - S ≤9.

But S is between 91 and 100.

Wait, but S =
