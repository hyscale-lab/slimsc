Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle, which means they are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. 

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let's process the information about the rectangles. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal and parallel.

I'll try to sketch a rough diagram to visualize it. I think ABCD is a rectangle, so let me label the points: A, B, C, D. If I consider A as the bottom-left corner, then B would be the top-left, C the top-right, and D the bottom-right. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. Let me see where E, F, G, H would be. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they must lie on a straight line. So, if D is a point, and E, C, F are on the same line, perhaps E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C on that line.

Wait, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So the order must be E, D, C, F, or some other order along a straight line. Let me think: if E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C, then the line would pass through E, D, C, F in that order. That makes sense because D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD, so they are next to each other. So, E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C, all on the same line.

Now, looking at rectangle EFGH. Since E, F are two of its vertices, and EF is one side, which is given as 184. Since it's a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal, so FG = 17, so EH must also be 17, and EF = 184, so GH is 184 as well.

Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths. So, in rectangle EFGH, EF is one side, which is 184, and FG is another side, which is 17. So, FG is adjacent to F, which is connected to E and G. So, the rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, the rectangle is 184 units long (EF) and 17 units tall (FG).

Similarly, rectangle ABCD has BC = 16 and AB = 107. Wait, BC would be one side, so BC is 16,
