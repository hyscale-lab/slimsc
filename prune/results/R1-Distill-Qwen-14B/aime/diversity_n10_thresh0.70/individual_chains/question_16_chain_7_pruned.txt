Okay, I'm trying to solve this math problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I then need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by understanding what it means for p² to divide n⁴ + 1. That is, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². But n⁴ is (n²)², so this is like saying n² is a square root of -1 modulo p².

I remember that for primes p, the existence of solutions to certain congruences relates to properties of p. For example, -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. But here, it's more complicated because we're dealing with fourth roots.

So, maybe I should check small primes and see if any of them satisfy that there's an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Let's start with the smallest primes.

The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Let me check p=2 first. Is there an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 2²=4?

n can be 1: 1⁴ +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16+1=17, which mod 4 is 1. n=3: 81+1=82, which mod 4 is 2. n=4: 256+1=257, mod 4 is 1. Hmm, seems like n⁴ +1 is either 2 or 1 mod 4, never 0. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Check if 3²=9 divides n⁴ +1 for any n.

Compute n⁴ mod 9:

n=1: 1 +1=2 mod9→2

n=2: 16+1=17→8 mod9

n=3: 81+1=82→1 mod9

n=4: 256 +1=257 →4 mod9

n=5: 625+1=626→626 mod9: 6+2+6=14→5 mod9

n=6: 6⁴=1296→1296 mod9 is 0, so 0+1=1 mod9.

n=7: 7⁴=2401→2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7→7 mod9.

n=8: 8⁴=4096→4+0+9+6=19→1 mod9.

n=9: 9⁴=6561→6 mod9, 6+1=7.

Wait, but n=1: 2, n=2:8, n=3:1, n=4:4, n=5:5, n=6:1, n=7:7, n=8:1, n=9:7. Hmm, none of these are 0 mod9. So p=3 is also out.

Next, p=5. Check if 25 divides n⁴ +1.

So n^4 ≡ -1 mod25.

Let me compute n^4 mod25 for various n:

n=1:1

n=2:16

n=3:81→6

n=4:256→6 (since 256-25*10=6)

n=5:0

n=6:6^4=1296→1296-25*51=1296-1275=21→21

n=7:7^4=2401. 2401 mod25: 2401 -25*96=2401-2400=1→1

n=8:8^4=4096. 4096 mod25: 4096 -25*163=4096-4075=21→21

n=9:9^4=6561. 6561 mod25. 6561 ÷25: 25*262=6550, 6561-6550=11→11.

n=10:0.

Wait, so n=1:1, n=2:16, n=3:6, n=4:6, n=5:0, n=6:21, n=7:1, n=8:21, n=9:11, n=10:0.

Hmm, looking for n^4 ≡24 mod25 (since -1 mod25 is 24). None of the n from 1 to 10 have n^4 ≡24 mod25. Maybe I need to check more n? Let's try n=11.

n=11: 11^4. 11 mod25 is 11. 11²=121→21. 21²=441→16. So 11^4= (11²)^2=21²=441→16 mod25. So 16≠24.

n=12: 12^4. 12²=144→19. 19²=361→11. So 12^4=11 mod25.

n=13: 13²=169→19. 19²=361→11. So 13^4=11.

n=14:14²=196→21. 21²=441→16. So 14^4=16.

n=15:0.

n=16:16²=256→6. 6²=36→11. So 16^4=11.

n=17:17²=289→14. 14²=196→21. So 17^4=21.

n=18:18²=324→24. 24²=576→1. So 18^4=1.

n=19:19²=361→11. 11²=121→21. So 19^4=21.

n=20:20²=400→0. 0²=0. So 0.

n=21:21²=441→16. 16²=256→6. So 21^4=6.

n=22:22²=484→9. 9²=81→6. So 22^4=6.

n=23:23²=529→4. 4²=16. So 23^4=16.

n=24:24²=576→1. 1²=1. So 24^4=1.

n=25:0.

So in the numbers from 1 to 25, none have n^4 ≡24 mod25. So perhaps p=5 is not suitable either.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake or perhaps p=5 is indeed not suitable. Let me think: For a prime p, if -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, then perhaps it's more likely that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. But maybe I need to check higher primes.

Wait, but maybe I should check p=17. Wait, no, let's proceed step by step.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8, there exists solutions to n⁴ ≡-1 mod p².

Wait, because I remember that if p is a prime and the multiplicative order of n modulo p² allows n^4 ≡ -1, then maybe p needs to satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Hensel's lemma to lift solutions from mod p to mod p².

Wait, first, maybe p=17 is the prime because 17 is 1 mod 4 and perhaps 1 mod 8. Let me check.

Wait, 17 mod8 is 1, yes. So maybe 17 is a candidate.

But let me first check p=5 again. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let me compute 18^4 mod25. 18 mod25 is 18. 18² is 324, which is 324-13*25=324-325=-1 mod25, which is 24. So 18² ≡24 mod25. Then, 18^4 would be (18²)^2 ≡24² mod25. 24² is 576. 576 ÷25 is 23*25=575, so 576-575=1. So 18^4 ≡1 mod25. Oh, right, so that's why 18^4 is 1 mod25. So no, 18^4 is 1, not 24.

Wait, so perhaps p=5 doesn't work. Let's try p=17. Let me check if there's any n with n^4 ≡-1 mod17²=289.

But before that, perhaps I should check modulo 17 first. So does there exist n where n^4 ≡-1 mod17?

Let me compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 8 (since 17 is prime, and modulo 17 has symmetry).

n=1:1

n=2:16

n=3:81 mod17: 81-4*17=81-68=13

n=4:256 mod17. 256 ÷17: 17*15=255, so 256≡1.

n=5:625 mod17. Let's compute 625 ÷17: 17*36=612, so 625-612=13.

n=6:6^4=1296. 1296 ÷17: 17*76=1292, so 1296≡4.

n=7:7^4=2401. 2401 ÷17: 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4.

n=8:8^4=4096. 4096 ÷17: 17*241=4097
