Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All opposite sides are parallel, which is interesting. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's not necessarily regular because regular hexagons have all sides equal and all angles equal, but here it's just equilateral, meaning all sides are equal, but angles might differ. But with opposite sides parallel, that must impose some symmetry.

Let me visualize this. Imagine a hexagon where each pair of opposite sides are both equal in length and parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. Since it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me think about how this triangle is formed. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, these three lines should intersect to form a triangle. So, each of these sides is a side of the triangle.

Wait, AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon. So, AB is one side, CD is another, and EF is the third. So, if I extend each of these sides until they meet, they form a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is convex, the extensions of these sides would meet to form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, 300.

I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon. Maybe similar triangles are involved here?

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s.

Given that opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being made up of a larger triangle with a smaller similar triangle cut off from each corner. Wait, is that right?

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is similar to a triangle but scaled down. Let me think.

If AB, CD, EF are extended to form a triangle, then each side of the hexagon is somehow related to the sides of this triangle. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, each side s is a segment on these extended lines.

I remember that in such cases, the sides of the hexagon can be related to the sides of the triangle via a ratio. Maybe each side of the hexagon is a scaled version of the triangle's sides by some factor.

Let me denote the triangle formed by the extensions as triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. Then, the hexagon is inscribed inside this triangle, touching each side. So, each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle.

Wait, but in the hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, which would
