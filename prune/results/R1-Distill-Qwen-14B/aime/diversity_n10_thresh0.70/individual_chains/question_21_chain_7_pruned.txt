Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. It's about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n must be a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). 

So, the task is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n. 

Let me break down what it means for n to be a two-digit number in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. That means d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d0 can be from 0 to b-1. Therefore, n can be written as n = d1 * b + d0.

The sum of the digits is d1 + d0, and according to the problem, this sum must equal sqrt(n). So, we have:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n)

But since n = d1 * b + d0, we can substitute sqrt(n) into the equation:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange the equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit complex. Maybe I can group terms differently. Let's think about the equation again:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me call s = d1 + d0, so s is the sum of the digits. Then, the equation becomes:

s^2 = d1*b + d0

But since d1 = s - d0, substituting this into the equation:

s^2 = (s - d0)*b + d0

Simplify the right side:

s^2 = s*b - d0*b + d0

s^2 = s*b + d0*(1 - b)

Let me rearrange for d0:

d0*(1 - b) = s^2 - s*b

d0 = [s^2 - s*b] / (1 - b)

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe I can factor it differently. Let's factor out s on the numerator:

d0 = [s(s - b)] / (1 - b) 

Notice that 1 - b is negative, so I can write it as:

d0 = [s(s - b)] / (-(b - 1)) = -s(s - b)/(b - 1)

Which simplifies to:

d0 = s(b - s)/(b - 1)

Okay, so d0 must be an integer between 0 and b-1, inclusive. Also, since d1 is a digit in base b, d1 = s - d0 must be between 1 and b-1. So, d1 >=1 and d1 <= b-1.

So, let's write the equations:

d0 = s*(b - s)/(b - 1)

And d1 = s - d0.

We have to ensure that both d0 and d1 are valid digits in base b. So, 0 <= d0 <= b-1 and 1 <= d1 <= b -1.

So, for given s and b, d0 must be an integer, and d1 must also be a positive integer less than b.

I think the approach here is to iterate over possible values of s and b and find for each b how many n satisfy the condition.

But since we need to find the minimal b where more than ten such numbers exist, perhaps it's better to find for each b, the number of possible s that result in valid d0 and d1.

Let me try to find constraints on s.

Since d1 and d0 are digits, d0 must be >=0 and <=b-1, and d1 = s - d0 >=1, so s - d0 >=1.

Also, since d0 = s*(b - s)/(b -1), and d0 must be an integer, s*(b - s) must be divisible by (b -1).

Wait, that's a key point. So, for d0 to be an integer, (b -1) must divide s*(b - s).

Let me write that as:

(b -1) | s*(b - s)

Which implies that (b -1) divides s*(b - s).

I can think of this as (b -1) divides s*(b - s). Let's denote m = b -1, to simplify.

Then, m divides s*(m - s + 1) because b - s = (m +1) - s.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, m = b -1, so b = m +1.

Then, (b - s) = (m +1 - s).

So, s*(b - s) = s*(m +1 - s) = s*(m +1) - s^2.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the divisibility condition.

Since m = b -1 is a positive integer >=1 (since b >=2), and m divides s*(b - s) = s*(m +1 - s).

So, m | s*(m +1 - s)

Let me write it as m | s*( (m +1) - s )

Which can be written as m | s*(m +1) - s^2.

So, m divides s*(m +1) - s^2.

But since m divides s*(m +1), because m divides s*(m +1) and m divides s^2.

Wait, no, actually, m divides [s*(m +1) - s^2].

That is, s*(m +1) - s^2 ≡ 0 mod m.

Which simplifies to s*( (m +1) - s ) ≡ 0 mod m.

Which is the same as:

s*( (m +1 - s) ) ≡ 0 mod m.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, since d0 must be an integer, s*(b - s)/(b -1) must be an integer. So, for given b, s must be such that (b -1) divides s*(b - s).

So, for each b, I can look for s in possible ranges, compute d0, and check if d0 is an integer and within 0 <= d0 <= b -1, and d1 = s - d0 is also within 1 <= d1 <= b -1.

But perhaps it's better to think about the range of possible s.

What's the minimum and maximum possible s?

Since d1 is at least 1, and d0 is at least 0, s = d1 + d0 is at least 1 + 0 = 1.

What's the maximum s? Since d1 can be up to b -1, and d0 up to b -1, s can be up to (b -1) + (b -1) = 2b - 2.

But n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is in the range [b, b^2 - 1]. Since sqrt(n) = s, s must be >= sqrt(b) and <= sqrt(b^2 -1) = b - 1/(b), so s is an integer, so s <= b -1.

Wait, because sqrt(b^2 -1) is slightly less than b, so the maximum integer s is b -1.

So, s can range from 1 to b -1.

So, s ∈ {1, 2, ..., b -1}

But for each s, we have to check whether d0 is integer and satisfies the digit constraints.

So, for each base b, s can be from 1 to b-1. For each s, compute d0 = s*(b - s)/(b -1), check if it is integer, and then check if d0 is between 0 and b -1, and d1 = s - d0 is between 1 and b -1.

If all these conditions are satisfied, then n = d1*b + d0 is a b-eautiful number.

So, for each b, count the number of s in 1 to b-1 for which d0 is integer, and digits d0 and d1 are valid.

Our goal is to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10.

So, perhaps I can model this as a function f(b) which counts the number of valid s for each b. Then, find the smallest b where f(b) >10.

But this might be tedious, but perhaps manageable for small b, but we need a smarter approach since b could be large.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for the number of solutions s for a given b.

Let me think about the equation again:

d0 = s*(b - s)/(b -1)

We can write this as:

d0 = s*(b - s)/(b -1) = s*(b - s)/(m), where m = b -1.

So, for d0 to be integer, m must divide s*(b
