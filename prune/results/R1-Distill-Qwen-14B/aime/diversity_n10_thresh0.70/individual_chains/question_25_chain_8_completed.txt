Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. There are 900 residents total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's one thing everyone has. Then, some own diamond rings, some own golf clubs, some own garden spades. 

Wait, the problem says: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Also, every resident has a bag of candy hearts. But then, we have some overlap information. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.

Hmm, okay. So, maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. I remember that for four sets, the formula can get a bit complicated, but let's see. 

Wait, but actually, each resident owns at least one thing—specifically, the candy hearts. So, the universal set here is 900, and all of them are included in at least one of the four categories. 

Let me define the sets:

- Let A be the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- Let B be those who own golf clubs.
- Let C be those who own a garden spade.
- Let D be those who own candy hearts. But wait, everyone owns D, so D is the entire set of 900.

So, we're looking for |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|. But since D is everyone, this is just |A ∩ B ∩ C|, the number of people who own all three plus D, which everyone has. So, maybe the answer is |A ∩ B ∩ C|, which is the same as the number of people who own all four.

But how do we find that? Let me think. The problem gives us the number of people who own exactly two things and exactly three things. So, perhaps using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but considering the overlaps.

Wait, the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But since everyone owns D, maybe this can simplify. Because D is everyone, so any intersection with D is just the other set. For example, |A∩D| = |A|, because everyone in A also has D. Similarly, |A∩B∩D| = |A∩B|, and |A∩B∩C∩D| = |A∩B∩C|.

So, substituting that, the inclusion-exclusion formula becomes:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A| - |B∩C| - |A| - |C| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C| - |A∩B∩C|

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me think again. Maybe it's easier to consider that since D is universal, the problem is effectively about three sets A, B, C within the universal set of 900.

So, perhaps I can model this as a three-set problem, where each person is in the universal set, and we have A, B, C as the sets of people owning diamond rings, clubs, spades respectively.

In that case, the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

But since everyone is in D, which includes all, the union |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| is just 900. Wait, but D is everyone, so |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| is 900 regardless. So, substituting, the formula becomes:

900 = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

Wait, but let me make sure. Since D is every resident, the union is already 900, so that's correct.

So, let me plug in the numbers we have:

|A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562.

So, 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

Let me calculate the sum of |A| + |B| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562.

Adding 195 and 367: 195 + 367 is 562. Then 562 + 562 is 1124. So, 900 = 1124 - (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) + |A∩B∩C|

So, rearranged:

|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C| - |A∩B∩C| = 1124 - 900 = 224.

Hmm, so the sum of the pairwise intersections minus the triple intersection is 224.

But we also know how many people own exactly two or exactly three things.

Wait, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, let me recall that in inclusion-exclusion, the counts include those who own two or three or four. But in our three-set problem (since D is universal), the counts for exactly two and exactly three are given.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Venn diagram regions.

In a three-set Venn diagram, there are 7 regions:

1. Only A
2. Only B
3. Only C
4. A and B only
5. A and C only
6. B and C only
7. All three, A∩B∩C.

We know that the number of people with exactly two things is 437, which corresponds to regions 4, 5, and 6.

And the number with exactly three things is 234, which is region 7.

So, the total number in regions 4,5,6 is 437, and region 7 is 234.

Now, the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:

|A| + |B| + |C| = (Only A) + (Only B) + (Only C) + 2*(A∩B only) + 2*(A∩C only) + 2*(B∩C only) + 3*(All three)

Wait, because when you add |A|, it includes:

Only A, A∩B only, A∩C only, and A∩B∩C.

So, adding |A| + |B| + |C| gives:

(Only A + Only B + Only C) + 2*(A∩B + A∩C + B∩C) + 3*(All three)

But in our case, |A∩B| includes those who are in exactly A∩B and those in all three. So, |A∩B| = (A∩B only) + (All three). Similarly for the others.

So, the sum |A| + |B| + |C| = (Only A + Only B + Only C) + (A∩B only + All three) + (A∩C only + All three) + (B∩C only + All three)

Which simplifies to:

(Only A + Only B + Only C) + (A∩B only + A∩C only + B∩C only) + 3*(All three)

But from earlier, |A| + |B| + |C| = 1124.

So, 1124 = (Only A + Only B + Only C) + (A∩B only + A∩C only + B∩C only) + 3*(All three)

But we know that the number of people with exactly two things is 437, which is (A∩B only + A∩C only + B∩C only). And the number with exactly three is 234.

So, substituting:

1124 = (Only A + Only B + Only C) + 437 + 3*234

Calculate 3 * 234: that's 702.

So,

1124 = (Only A + Only B + Only C) + 437 + 702

Adding 437 + 702 gives 1139.

So,

1124 = (Only A + Only B + Only C) + 1139

Wait, that would mean (Only A + Only B + Only C) = 1124 - 1139 = -15.

That can't be right. Negative number of people? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me think again. Maybe my initial approach is incorrect. Let me go back.

Wait a second, perhaps the problem is that the original inclusion-exclusion formula I used was for the union, but in this case, since D is universal, the union is 900. But perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the principle that:

Total number of residents = Number owning exactly one thing + Number owning exactly two things + Number owning exactly three things + Number owning all four.

Wait, because each resident owns at least the candy hearts, but the other three things (diamond, golf, spade) can be owned in various combinations.

Wait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two of the things, and 234 own exactly three. But which things? Are those exactly two of the three (diamond, golf, spade) or exactly two including candy hearts?

Wait, the problem says: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, candy hearts are the fourth thing. So, when it says 437 own exactly two of these things, that includes the candy hearts? Or is it among the first three?

Wait, the problem says: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, D is the set of all 900. So, the four things are A, B, C, D. But the problem specifies 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three.

Wait, so when they say "exactly two", it's any two of the four, but D is universal. Hmm, that complicates things. Because D is universal, so if someone owns exactly two things, it's D plus one other. Because D is mandatory. So, for example, someone could own D and A, but not B or C. Or D and B, or D and C, or D and two others, etc.

Wait, but the problem says that 437 own exactly two of the four things. But since D is owned by everyone, owning exactly two would mean owning D plus exactly one other thing, right? Because if you own D plus one other, that's two things. If you own D plus two others, that's three things, which is in the 'exactly three' category.

Wait, but the problem states: "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things."

So, let me think: each resident owns at least D. So, when they say "exactly two", that would mean D plus exactly one more thing, because if they own D plus two others, that's three things, which would be in the 'exactly three' category. Similarly, "exactly three" would mean D plus two more things.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Because, for example, someone could own D plus two other things, making three, but D is one, so the count is three. But if they own exactly two of the four, that would mean D plus one other. Because if they own exactly two, it's D plus one, because D is mandatory. So, someone who owns exactly two things must have D plus one other. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things would have D plus two others.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the 437 who own exactly two things are the ones who have D plus one other (A, B, or C). And the 234 who own exactly three have D plus two others.

So, let's model this.

Let me define:

- a = number of people who own only D and A (exactly two things)
- b = number owning only D and B
- c = number owning only D and C
- ab = number owning D, A, and B (exactly three)
- ac = number owning D, A, and C
- bc = number owning D, B, and C
- abc = number owning D, A, B, and C (all four)

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that 437 own exactly two of these four things. Which would be a + b + c. Because these are the people who have exactly two: D plus one other.

Similarly, the 234 who own exactly three would be ab + ac + bc. Because these have D plus two others.

And the number who own all four would be abc, which is the same as |A ∩ B ∩ C| because D is already included.

So, our variables are:

- Exactly two: a + b + c = 437
- Exactly three: ab + ac + bc = 234
- All four: abc = ?

Now, our goal is to find abc.

Now, let's express the total number of people in each set.

The total number of people owning A is 195, which includes:

- a (only A and D)
- ab (A, B, D)
- ac (A, C, D)
- abc (A, B, C, D)

So,

a + ab + ac + abc = 195 → equation (1)

Similarly, for B:

b + ab + bc + abc = 367 → equation (2)

And for C:

c + ac + bc + abc = 562 → equation (3)

We have exactly two equations:

a + b + c = 437 → equation (4)
ab + ac + bc = 234 → equation (5)

We also have the total number of people, which is 900. The total can be broken down into:

Only D: 0 (since everyone has D, but they might have more)
Exactly two: a + b + c =437
Exactly three: ab + ac + bc =234
Exactly four: abc

So, the total is:

437 (exactly two) + 234 (exactly three) + abc (all four) + those who have only one thing.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, because each person has at least D. So, the only way they can have exactly one thing is if they have only D. But the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but they might also own other things. So, is it possible to have someone who owns only D? Or do they have to have at least one of the other three?

Hmm, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." But it doesn't say they can't have only D. So, perhaps the total is:

Only D: let's call this x
Exactly two: a + b + c =437
Exactly three: ab + ac + bc =234
All four: abc

So, the total is x + 437 + 234 + abc = 900.

So, x + abc = 900 - (437 + 234) → 900 - 671 = 229.

So, x + abc = 229 → equation (6)

But I'm not sure if x is zero or not. Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether anyone owns only D. So, perhaps x could be zero, but I don't think we can assume that. Hmm.

Wait, but let's see. Let's try to find abc using the other equations.

We have equations (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6).

But maybe we can find a way to express a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc in terms of known quantities.

Let me try to add equations (1), (2), and (3):

Equation (1): a + ab + ac + abc = 195
Equation (2): b + ab + bc + abc = 367
Equation (3): c + ac + bc + abc = 562
Adding them together:

(a + b + c) + 2(ab + ac + bc) + 3(abc) = 195 + 367 + 562

From equation (4), a + b + c = 437.

From equation (5), ab + ac + bc = 234.

So, substituting:

437 + 2*(234) + 3*(abc) = 195 + 367 + 562

Calculate the right side: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

Left side: 437 + 468 + 3abc = 905 + 3abc.

So,

905 + 3abc = 1124 → 3abc = 1124 - 905 = 219 → abc = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, abc = 73. That's the number of people who own all four things.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense.

So, abc is 73. Then from equation (6), x + 73 = 229 → x = 229 -73 = 156. So, 156 people own only D.

Let me verify whether all the numbers add up correctly.

Now, let's compute a, b, c, ab, ac, bc.

Wait, from equation (4): a + b + c = 437.

From equation (5): ab + ac + bc = 234.

And abc =73.

Now, let's compute the individual equations.

From equation (1): a + ab + ac + 73 = 195 → a + ab + ac = 122.

Similarly, equation (2): b + ab + bc +73 = 367 → b + ab + bc = 294.

Equation (3): c + ac + bc +73 =562 → c + ac + bc=489.

Now, let me express a, b, c in terms of other variables.

Let me define:

From equation (4): a = 437 - b - c.

From equation (5): ab = 234 - ac - bc.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of known sums.

But maybe let's consider the system:

We have:

1. a + ab + ac = 122
2. b + ab + bc = 294
3. c + ac + bc = 489
4. a + b + c = 437
5. ab + ac + bc = 234
6. abc = 73

Let me see if I can solve for a, b, c.

Hmm, perhaps adding equations 1, 2, 3:

(a + ab + ac) + (b + ab + bc) + (c + ac + bc) ) = 122 + 294 + 489 = 905.

Left side: a + b + c + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc.

Which is (a + b + c) + 2*(ab + ac + bc) = 437 + 2*234 = 437 + 468 = 905. Which matches the right side. So, that's consistent.

But maybe we can solve for a, b, c individually.

From equation (1): a = 122 - ab - ac.

From equation (2): b = 294 - ab - bc.

From equation (3): c = 489 - ac - bc.

Now, substitute these into equation (4):

(122 - ab - ac) + (294 - ab - bc) + (489 - ac - bc) = 437.

Expanding:

122 + 294 + 489 - ab - ac - ab - bc - ac - bc = 437.

Simplify:

122 + 294 = 416; 416 + 489 = 905.

So, 905 - [2ab + 2ac + 2bc] = 437.

Which gives:

2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 905 - 437 = 468 → ab + ac + bc = 234, which is equation (5). So, this is consistent.

So, that doesn't help me find a, b, c individually. But perhaps I don't need to find them for the problem, since the question only asks for abc, which is 73.

Wait, but let me just check again. So, from the sum:

Adding the three equations (1), (2), (3) gives 905 = 437 + 2*234 + abc*3, but that's how we got abc=73.

So, it all checks out. Therefore, the number of people who own all four things is 73.

So, the answer is 73.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data step by step.

1. **Define the sets:**
   - Let \( A \) be the set of residents owning a diamond ring.
   - Let \( B \) be the set of residents owning a set of golf clubs.
   - Let \( C \) be the set of residents owning a garden spade.
   - Let \( D \) be the set of residents owning a bag of candy hearts, where \( |D| = 900 \) since everyone owns this.

2. **Given data:**
   - \( |A| = 195 \)
   - \( |B| = 367 \)
   - \( |C| = 562 \)
   - 437 residents own exactly two of the four items.
   - 234 residents own exactly three of the four items.

3. **Breakdown of ownership categories:**
   - **Exactly two items:** These include combinations of \( D \) with one other item (e.g., \( A \) only, \( B \) only, \( C \) only).
   - **Exactly three items:** These include combinations of \( D \) with two other items (e.g., \( A \) and \( B \), \( A \) and \( C \), \( B \) and \( C \)).
   - **All four items:** This is the intersection \( A \cap B \cap C \cap D \), which we aim to find.

4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle for three sets:**
   Applying the principle to sets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) within the universal set \( D \):
   \[
   |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|
   \]
   Since \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \) (all residents), we have:
   \[
   900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|) + |A \cap B \cap C|
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   900 = 1124 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|) + |A \cap B \cap C|
   \]
   \[
   |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - |A \cap B \cap C| = 224
   \]

5. **Relating to exactly two and three item owners:**
   - The number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, which corresponds to the pairwise intersections excluding those who own all three.
   - The number of residents owning exactly three items is 234, which corresponds to \( |A \cap B \cap C| \).

6. **Formulating equations:**
   Let the number of residents owning all four items be \( x \) (which is \( |A \cap B \cap C| \)). Then:
   \[
   |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| = 437 + 3x
   \]
   Substituting into the earlier equation:
   \[
   (437 + 3x) - x = 224
   \]
   \[
   437 + 2x = 224
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 224 - 437 = -213 \quad \text{(This leads to a negative value, which is incorrect.)}
   \]

7. **Revisiting the approach:**
   Correctly applying the inclusion-exclusion principle and solving the system of equations leads to:
   \[
   x = 73
   \]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
