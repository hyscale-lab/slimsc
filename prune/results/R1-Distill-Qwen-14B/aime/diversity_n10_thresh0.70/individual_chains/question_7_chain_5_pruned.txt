Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. Hmm, that's a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know a regular octagon has 8 sides, so it has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That will be the denominator in my probability calculation.

Now, the problem is about rotations. A regular octagon can be rotated by multiples of 45 degrees because 360/8 = 45. So the rotation group here is cyclic of order 8. That means there are 8 possible rotations: 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째. Each of these rotations can potentially map the blue vertices to where the red ones were.

Wait, but the problem says "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So essentially, I need the set of blue vertices to be exactly the same as the set of red vertices after some rotation.

But how does that work? Let's think about it. Suppose I have a coloring where some of the vertices are blue. If I rotate the octagon by some angle, the positions of the blue vertices will move to new positions. For the condition to be satisfied, after this rotation, every blue vertex must be in a position that was originally red. So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but since every vertex is either red or blue, the set of red vertices is just the complement of the blue set. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the red set must be a rotation of itself. Hmm, that might not make sense unless the red set is rotationally symmetric.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of orbits. Each vertex is in an orbit under the rotation group. For the octagon, each vertex is in a single orbit because you can rotate to any other vertex. So, all vertices are in the same orbit. But maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can
