Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base where this property holds for over ten numbers.

Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, let's formalize the problem. If n is a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a must be between 1 and b-1 (since it's the leading digit) and c must be between 0 and b-1. 

The sum of the digits a + c should equal sqrt(n). So, we have the equation:

a + c = sqrt(n)  
But n = a * b + c, so substituting, we get:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c

Let me rearrange the equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe we can express this in terms of a and c. Let's collect like terms:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So, for given b and c, we can solve for a. But since a and c are digits, a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c must be an integer between 0 and b-1.

Wait, but maybe another approach would be better. Let me think. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, the smallest n is when a=1 and c=0, which is 1*b + 0 = b. The largest n is when a = b-1 and c = b-1, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1. So, n must be between b and b^2 - 1.

Also, sqrt(n) must be an integer because it's equal to a + c, which is an integer. So, n must be a perfect square. That's an important point. So, n is a perfect square between b and b^2 - 1.

Let me denote k = sqrt(n). Then, k is an integer, and n = k^2. So, substituting back into the equation:

k = a + c  
k^2 = a * b + c

So, we can write:

k^2 = a * b + c  
We also have k = a + c, so c = k - a.

Substituting c into the first equation:

k^2 = a * b + (k - a)  
Simplify:

k^2 = a*b + k - a  
Bring all terms to one side:

k^2 - k - a*b + a = 0  
Factor a:

k^2 - k + a*(1 - b) = 0

Hmm, maybe solving for a:

Let me rearrange:

a*(b - 1) = k^2 - k  
So,

a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer in that range.

So, for each base b, and for each possible k where k is such that n = k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, we can compute a and see if it's a valid digit.

Wait, but perhaps another way. Let's consider the possible values of k. Since n = k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, the value of n must satisfy b ≤ k^2 ≤ b^2 - 1. So, taking square roots, sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1). Since k is an integer, so k must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)) and at most floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)).

But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is just slightly less than b, so the maximum k is b-1, because (b)^2 is b^2, which is more than the maximum two-digit number (b^2 - 1). So, k can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.

So, for a given b, the possible k's are integers from m to b-1, where m is the smallest integer such that m^2 ≥ b.

So, m = ceil(sqrt(b)).

Now, for each k in [m, b-1], compute a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1). If a is an integer, between 1 and b-1, and c = k - a is between 0 and b-1, then n = k^2 is a b-eautiful number.

So, our problem reduces to, for each base b starting from 2, count how many k's satisfy that a is integer and within the required range, and then find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

Hmm, that seems manageable. But since we don't know the upper limit for b, we need a systematic way to check each base and count the number of valid k's.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express b in terms of a and k, since from a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1), we can solve for b:

b - 1 = (k^2 - k)/a  
So,

b = (k^2 - k)/a + 1

Since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, (k^2 - k)/a must be an integer, and b must be at least 2.

Also, since a must be between 1 and b-1, and given that b = (k^2 - k)/a + 1, we can see that a must be a divisor of (k^2 - k).

So, for each k, we can find all possible a's that divide k(k -
