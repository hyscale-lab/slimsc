Alright, so I've got this complex number problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me write down what I know. The expression involves a complex number \( z \) and its reciprocal. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can express \( z \) in polar form, maybe that will help. So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That makes sense because the modulus is 4, so in polar form, it's 4 times a point on the unit circle.

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's see. First, let's compute \( (75 + 117i)z \). That would be \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). Let me compute the constants first. 75 times 4 is 300, and 117 times 4 is 468. So, that term becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \).

Wait, no, actually, \( (75 + 117i) \times 4 = 300 + 468i \) and then multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \). So, the term is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Similarly, the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( 1/z = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). But since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \), so \( 1/z = e^{-i\theta}/4 \).

Therefore, \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (96 + 144i) \times \frac{e^{-i\theta}}{4} \). Let me compute the constants here: 96 divided by 4 is 24, and 144 divided by 4 is 36. So, that term becomes \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So now, the entire expression is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \). Hmm, okay. Maybe I can write this as the sum of two complex exponentials.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express each term in terms of sine and cosine. Let me recall that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, let's expand both terms:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Let me compute each part separately.

Starting with the first term:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Multiplying this out:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta.

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta.

Now, let's group the real and imaginary parts.

Real part: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta.

Imaginary part: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i.

Similarly, for the second term:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Multiplying this out:

= 24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta.

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:

= 24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.

Imaginary part: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i.

Now, adding the two terms together. The entire expression is the sum of the first term and the second term.

So, let's add the real parts:

First term's real part: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta.

Second term's real part: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.

Sum of real parts: (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta.

Which simplifies to: 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

Similarly, adding the imaginary parts:

First term's imaginary part: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i.

Second term's imaginary part: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i.

Sum of imaginary parts: (300\sin\theta -24\sin\theta) + (468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta) all times i.

Which simplifies to: (276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i.

So, the entire expression is:

Real part: 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

Imaginary part: 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta.

But since we're only interested in the real part, let's focus on that. So, the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Wait, so the problem is to find the maximum real part of this expression, so we can think of it as a function of \( \theta \).
