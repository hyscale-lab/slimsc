Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A number n is called b-eautiful if when you write it in base b, it has exactly two digits. Moreover, the sum of these two digits should equal the square root of n. 

An example was given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

So, I need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me break down the problem. 

First, represent n in base b as a two-digit number. In base b, a two-digit number is written as d1 d0, where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. So, the value of n is d1*b + d0. 

The sum of the digits is d1 + d0. According to the problem, this sum should equal sqrt(n). So, we have:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n)

But n is also equal to d1*b + d0. So, substituting n, we get:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Now, let's rearrange this equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. But maybe I can find another way to represent this.

Alternatively, since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, they must satisfy 0 <= d0 < b and 1 <= d1 < b (since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero).

Also, since sqrt(n) = d1 + d0, n must be a perfect square. So, n = k^2, where k = d1 + d0. 

Wait, let me note that down:

n = k^2, where k = d1 + d0

But n is also equal to d1*b + d0. So:

d1*b + d0 = k^2

But since k = d1 + d0, we can write:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2

So, we can write this as:

(d1 + d0)^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Which is the same equation I had before.

Let me consider this as a quadratic in d1:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

Alternatively, maybe it's better to express in terms of d0.

But perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about possible values of k.

Since n is a two-digit number in base b, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b, and the largest is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1.

So, n is between b and b^2 -1.

But n is also a perfect square, so n = k^2.

So, k must satisfy sqrt(b) <= k <= sqrt(b^2 -1). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is just a bit less than b, k can be from 1 up to b-1, but wait:

Wait, sqrt(b) is approximately 3.16 when b=10, but for smaller b, it's smaller.

Wait, let's see: n is a two-digit number in base b, so n >= b (the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b) and n <= (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1. So, n is in [b, b^2 -1]. 

Thus, k^2 must be in [b, b^2 -1]. So, k must satisfy sqrt(b) <= k <= sqrt(b^2 -1) < b. So, k can be integers from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.

But since k = d1 + d0, and d1 and d0 are digits in base b, their sum can be at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. However, since k = sqrt(n), and n <= b^2 -1, k is at most sqrt(b^2 -1) which is just less than b. So, k <= b -1. So, k can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.

Wait, but for each k in that range, I need to find pairs (d1, d0) such that:

1. d1 + d0 = k
2. d1*b + d0 = k^2

So, substituting d0 = k - d1 into the second equation:

d1*b + (k - d1) = k^2

Simplify:

d1*(b - 1) + k = k^2

So,

d1*(b - 1) = k^2 - k

Which gives:

d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (k^2 -k) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be an integer in [1, b-1].

So, d1 = (k(k -1))/(b -1)

Hmm, so for each k, (k(k-1)) must be divisible by (b-1), and the quotient must be a digit in base b, so 1 <= d1 <= b-1.

So, for each base b, and each k in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b-1], we can compute d1 = k(k-1)/(b-1). If d1 is integer and in [1, b-1], then d0 = k - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.

Therefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides k(k-1), and d1 = k(k-1)/(b-1) is an integer between 1 and b-1, and d0 = k - d1 is between 0 and b-1.

So, for each b, we can compute how many such k's exist.

Our goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such k's is more than ten.

So, perhaps the strategy is to iterate over possible bases b starting from 2 upwards, and for each b, compute the number of valid k's, and find the smallest b where this number exceeds ten.

But since this is a math problem, perhaps there's a smarter way to approach it rather than brute-forcing each b.

First, let's analyze the equation d1 = k(k-1)/(b-1). So, for d1 to be integer, (b -1) must divide k(k -1). So, (b-1) | k(k -1). 

But since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Hence, (b-1) must divide either k or k-1, or factors of them.

So, the factors of (b-1) must be distributed between k and k-1.

Let me denote m = b -1. So, m must divide k(k-1). Since k and k-1 are coprime, m must be a product of factors of k and k-1. So, m can be written as m1 * m2, where m1 divides k and m2 divides k-1, and gcd(m1, m2) =1.

So, for each m, the number of possible k's is determined by the number of ways to split m into two coprime factors m1 and m2, such that k ≡ 0 mod m1 and k ≡1 mod m2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think of m as the product of m1 and m2, with m1 |k and m2 | (k-1), and m1 and m2 coprime.

But this might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, for each m, the number of k's in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), m] such that m divides k(k-1). Since m = b-1, and k ranges up to m (since k ≤ b-1 = m).

Wait, but k goes up to m, since b = m +1, and k ≤ m.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps for each m = b -1, the number of k's in the range [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that k ≡0 or 1 mod some factors of m.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of divisors. For each m, the number of k's is equal to the number of k in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides k(k-1). Since k and k-1 are coprime, m must be the product of two coprime factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k-1.

But perhaps it's getting too abstract. Maybe let's consider for each m, the number of k's where m divides k(k-1). Since m and k are variables, perhaps the number of such k's is equal to the number of divisors of m.

Wait, no. Because for each m, the number of k's where m divides k(k-1) is equal to the number of k in [1, m] such that k ≡0 mod d or k ≡1 mod d, where d is a divisor of m.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of m as the product of two coprime numbers, a and b, such that a divides k and b divides (k-1). Then, the number of such k's is equal to the number of solutions to these congruences.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think about specific examples to get a better understanding.

Take the example given: b=13, so m=12.

Then, k can range from ceiling(sqrt(13))=4 up to m=12.

We need k such that 12 divides k(k-1). Since 12=3*4, and 3 and 4 are coprime, so k must satisfy either k ≡0 mod 3 and k ≡1 mod 4, or k ≡0 mod 4 and k ≡1 mod 3.

Let me solve these congruences.

Case 1: k ≡0 mod 3, k ≡1 mod4.

Find k ≡ x mod 12.

Solutions:

k ≡0 mod3, so k can be 0,3,6,9 mod12.

But also k ≡1 mod4.

So:

Check k=3: 3 mod4=3 ≠1.

k=6: 6 mod4=2≠1.

k=9:9 mod4=1. Yes! So k ≡9 mod12.

Case 2: k≡0 mod4 and k≡1 mod3.

So, k=0 mod4, and k=1 mod3.

Possible k: 4,8,12 mod12.

Check which satisfy k≡1 mod3.

4 mod3=1. Yes, so k≡4 mod12.

8 mod3=2≠1.

12 mod3=0≠1.

So, solutions are k≡4 mod12 and k≡9 mod12.

Thus, for m=12, possible k's are 4,9, and then 13,16, etc., but since k goes up to m=12, only k=4 and k=9.

But in our earlier example, k was 6+3=9. Hmm, but wait, in the example, n=81, which is 9^2. So, k=9, which is one solution.

But in the range [4,12], there are two solutions: k=4 and k=9.

Wait, but does k=4 give a valid number?

Let's check: k=4.

Then, d1 = (4*3)/(12)=12/12=1.

d0 = 4 -1=3.

So, n =1*13 +3=16. Which is 4^2=16. So yes, 16 is 13-eautiful.

Similarly, k=9: d1=(9*8)/12=72/12=6, d0=9-6=3, n=6*13+3=81=9^2.

So, for b=13, there are two k's:4 and9, thus two b-eautiful numbers.

But the problem states that we need more than ten such numbers. So, in this case, only two.

So, perhaps for larger b, we can get more k's, thus more n's.

So, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides k(k-1). 

So, our problem reduces to: find the smallest m+1 (where m = b-1) such that the number of k's in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m] with m |k(k-1) is greater than ten.

So, perhaps it's better to treat m instead of b. Let m = b-1.

Then, the problem is to find the smallest m >=1 such that the number of k's in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m] where m divides k(k-1) is greater than ten.

So, for each m, count the number of k in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m] where m divides k(k-1).

We need to find the smallest m such that this count exceeds ten.

So, perhaps I can write a function f(m) that counts the number of k's in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m] where m divides k(k-1). Then, find the smallest m where f(m) >10.

But since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for f(m).

Given that m divides k(k-1), and since k and k-1 are coprime, m must be a product of two coprime numbers a and b, where a divides k and b divides (k-1). So, m = a*b, with gcd(a,b)=1.

Then, for each such pair (a,b), there exists a unique solution modulo m to the system k ≡0 mod a and k≡1 mod b.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since a and b are coprime, this system has a unique solution modulo m.

Thus, for each such pair (a,b), there is exactly one residue class modulo m where k satisfies k ≡0 mod a and k≡1 mod b.

Therefore, the number of solutions k in [1, m] is equal to the number of such pairs (a,b) where a*b = m and gcd(a,b)=1.

Wait, that's an important point. For each divisor a of m, set b = m/a. Then, if a and b are coprime, the system k ≡0 mod a and k≡1 mod b has a solution.

Thus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to factor m into two coprime divisors a and b, i.e., the number of coprime pairs (a,b) such that a*b = m.

But in our case, k must be in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m]. So, not all solutions may lie in that interval.

But perhaps for small m, the number of such k's is small. As m increases, the number of coprime pairs (a,b) increases, leading to more solutions k.

So, the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given m is roughly equal to the number of coprime pairs (a,b) such that a*b = m, and k is in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m].

Wait, but the number of coprime pairs (a,b) is equal to 2^{number of distinct prime factors of m}. Because each prime factor can be assigned to either a or b, but not both, since a and b must be coprime.

So, for a number m with t distinct prime factors, the number of such coprime pairs (a,b) is 2^t. But since (a,b) and (b,a) are considered the same in terms of the product m, perhaps we have to adjust.

Wait, no. For each coprime pair (a,b) with a*b = m, each distinct pair is unique. But since a and b are positive integers greater than 1, the number of such pairs is 2^{t}, where t is the number of distinct prime factors of m.

Wait, for example, if m is a prime power, say m = p^k, then the only coprime pairs (a,b) are (1, m) and (m,1). But since a and b must be greater than or equal to 1, but in our case, a can be 1, but then b = m. Similarly, b can be 1, then a = m. So, for m = p^k, the number of coprime pairs (a,b) is 2.

Similarly, for m = p*q, where p and q are distinct primes, the coprime pairs are (1, pq), (p, q), (q, p), (pq,1). But since (p,q) and (q,p) are different only if p ≠ q, but they result in different k's.

Wait, so for m with t distinct prime factors, the number of coprime pairs (a,b) is 2^t, but each pair is ordered (a,b). So, the total number of ordered coprime pairs is 2^t.

But in our case, each coprime pair (a,b) gives a unique solution k modulo m, and each such solution is in the range [1, m]. So, for each coprime pair, there is exactly one k in [1, m] that satisfies the congruences.

Thus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such ordered coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b = m.

Wait, but in our case, a and b are positive integers greater than 1? Or can a or b be 1?

Because in the problem, d1 must be at least 1, and d0 must be at least 0.

Wait, d1 = k(k-1)/(m) = (k^2 -k)/m. Since d1 must be at least 1, (k^2 -k)/m >=1. So, k^2 -k >= m.

But m = b -1, and k <= m.

So, k^2 -k >= m = b -1.

But since k <= m, then k^2 -k >= m.

So, for k in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m], we have k^2 -k >= m.

But perhaps this doesn't restrict much because for k near m, k^2 is much larger than m.

Wait, let's see: for m =10, k=10: 10^2 -10=90, which is much larger than m=10.

So, perhaps the main restriction is that d1 must be an integer, which requires that m divides k(k-1).

So, going back, for each m, the number of k's is equal to the number of ordered coprime pairs (a,b) with a*b =m. Which is 2^{number of distinct prime factors of m}.

Wait, for m=12, which has prime factors 2 and 3, so t=2. So, number of coprime pairs is 2^2=4.

But earlier, for m=12, we found two solutions: k=4 and k=9. Wait, but 4 solutions were expected? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, m=12=2^2*3.

Number of distinct prime factors t=2, so number of ordered coprime pairs (a,b) is 2^2=4.

Each pair (a,b) gives a solution k.

So, let's find all four solutions.

Possible ordered coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=12:

1. a=1, b=12: gcd(1,12)=1. So, k ≡0 mod1 (always true), and k ≡1 mod12. So, k ≡1 mod12. So, k=1,13,... but since k <=12, only k=1. But k must be >= ceiling(sqrt(13))=4, so k=1 is invalid.

2. a=3, b=4: gcd(3,4)=1. So, k ≡0 mod3 and k≡1 mod4. As before, k=9 mod12.

3. a=4, b=3: gcd(4,3)=1. So, k≡0 mod4 and k≡1 mod3. As before, k=4 mod12.

4. a=12, b=1: gcd(12,1)=1. So, k≡0 mod12 and k≡1 mod1. But k≡1 mod1 is always true, so k=0 mod12. So, k=0,12,... but k must be >=4 and <=12. So, k=12.

So, the possible k's are 9,4,12. Wait, but 12 is within [4,12]. So, we have k=4,9,12.

Wait, but earlier, when we had m=12, we only found k=4 and k=9. What about k=12?

Let me check k=12.

d1 = (12*11)/12 = 132/12=11.

d0 = 12 -11=1.

So, n=11*13 +1= 143 +1=144. Which is 12^2. So, 144 is also a 13-eautiful number.

So, k=12 is also a solution.

So, for m=12, there are three k's:4,9,12. So, three solutions.

Wait, so why did I get three solutions, but the number of coprime pairs was four? Because in one of the pairs, k=1, which is below the lower limit of k >= ceiling(sqrt(m+1))=4. So, only three solutions are valid.

So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=m, and the corresponding k is in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m].

So, for m=12, three solutions.

So, in general, for each m, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's in [ceiling(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides k(k-1). Which is equivalent to the number of coprime pairs (a,b) with a*b=m, and the solution k is in that range.

Thus, the number of solutions depends on the number of coprime pairs and the range of k.

Therefore, to find the minimal m where the number of solutions exceeds ten, I need to find m where the number of such k's is greater than ten.

Given that for each m, the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a,b) with a*b=m, minus the number of such pairs where the corresponding k is less than ceiling(sqrt(m+1)).

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe let's look for m's with many coprime factors.

The number of coprime pairs (a,b) is 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors of m. So, to maximize the number of coprime pairs, m should have as many distinct prime factors as possible.

So, for m with t distinct prime factors, the number of coprime pairs is 2^t. So, to get more than ten solutions, we need 2^t >10. So, t needs to be at least 4, since 2^4=16>10. So, m must have at least four distinct prime factors.

Wait, but that's only if all coprime pairs result in k's within the desired range. So, m needs to have at least four distinct prime factors to have 16 coprime pairs, but some of these might result in k's below the lower limit.

Wait, but perhaps m can be the product of four distinct primes, so that 2^4=16, which is more than ten. So, the minimal m with four distinct prime factors would be 2*3*5*7=210.

Wait, but 210 is quite large, so m=210, b=211.

But maybe there's a smaller m with a higher number of coprime pairs. Alternatively, perhaps m is a square-free number with many factors.

Wait, but even if m is square-free with four factors, 2*3*5*7=210. So, the minimal m with four distinct prime factors is 210.

But perhaps m can be a smaller number with a higher number of coprime pairs due to exponents.

Wait, but for m= p^a, the number of coprime pairs is 2, as I thought earlier. So, for m to have a high number of coprime pairs, it needs to have many distinct prime factors.

So, let's consider m=2*3*5*7=210. Then, the number of coprime pairs (a,b) is 2^4=16. So, potentially, 16 solutions. But many of them will have k less than sqrt(211)≈14.526. So, k must be >=15.

So, for m=210, k ranges from 15 to 210.

But each coprime pair (a,b) will give a unique k in [1,210]. So, how many of these k's are >=15?

Hmm, that's unclear. For example, the pair (1,210) gives k=1, which is below 15. Similarly, the pair (210,1) gives k=210, which is above 15. The pair (2,105) gives k=0 mod2 and 1 mod105. Let's find k ≡0 mod2, k≡1 mod105.

Using Chinese Remainder Theorem, solve:

k ≡0 mod2

k ≡1 mod105

Let me find k:

k =105*t +1. We need 105t +1 ≡0 mod2 => 105t ≡-1 mod2 => 1*t ≡1 mod2 => t≡1 mod2.

So, t=2s+1.

Thus, k=105*(2s+1)+1=210s +106.

Within m=210, s=0 gives k=106, which is within [15,210]. s=1 gives k=316, which is above 210. So, only k=106.

Similarly, other pairs will give k's spread across the range.

So, perhaps for m=210, a significant number of k's will be above 15. But I'm not sure if exactly 16 or more. It's possible, but perhaps m=210 is the candidate.

But wait, let's try a smaller m. Suppose m=12, which has two distinct prime factors, giving 4 coprime pairs. But in reality, we found three solutions.

Wait, but 2^t is the number of ordered coprime pairs, but not all k's are within the required range.

So, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime pairs minus the number of pairs where k is below the lower limit.

But without knowing exactly how many k's are below, it's hard to estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps m=2^4=16. Wait, m=16, which is 2^4. The number of coprime pairs (a,b) would be 2, since the only coprime pairs are (1,16) and (16,1). So, only two k's: k=1 and k=16. But k=1 is below sqrt(17)=~4.123, so k=16 is the only solution. So, only one solution.

Not enough.

Alternatively, m=60=2^2*3*5. So, number of distinct prime factors t=3. So, number of coprime pairs is 2^3=8. So, 8 solutions.

But how many of them are in the range [ceiling(sqrt(61))=8, 60].

Let me compute these k's.

For m=60, the coprime pairs (a,b) are:

1. (1,60): k=1, invalid.

2. (2,30): gcd(2,30)=2≠1. So, not coprime. Wait, no, a and b must be coprime.

Wait, to list all coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=60 and gcd(a,b)=1.

So, possible a's are the divisors of 60, and b=60/a. Then, check if a and b are coprime.

Divisors of 60:1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60.

For each divisor a:

a=1: b=60, gcd(1,60)=1. Valid.

a=2: b=30, gcd(2,30)=2≠1. Invalid.

a=3: b=20, gcd(3,20)=1. Valid.

a=4: b=15, gcd(4,15)=1. Valid.

a=5: b=12, gcd(5,12)=1. Valid.

a=6: b=10, gcd(6,10)=2≠1. Invalid.

a=10: b=6, same as above. Invalid.

a=12: b=5, same as a=5. Valid.

a=15: b=4, same as a=4. Valid.

a=20: b=3, same as a=3. Valid.

a=30: b=2, same as a=2. Invalid.

a=60: b=1, same as a=1. Valid.

So, the valid coprime pairs are:

(1,60), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (12,5), (15,4), (20,3), (60,1).

So, total of 8 pairs.

Each pair gives a solution for k.

Let's compute k for each pair.

1. (1,60): k ≡0 mod1, k≡1 mod60. So, k=60t +1. In [8,60], t=0 gives k=1 (invalid), t=1 gives k=61 (beyond m=60). So, no solution in this case.

2. (3,20): k ≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod20.

Find k ≡0 mod3 and ≡1 mod20.

Using Chinese Remainder Theorem:

Let k =20s +1.

We need 20s +1 ≡0 mod3 => 20s ≡-1 mod3 => (20 mod3)s ≡2 mod3 => (2)s ≡2 mod3 => s ≡1 mod3.

So, s=3t +1.

Thus, k=20*(3t +1)+1=60t +21.

Within m=60, t=0 gives k=21, which is in [8,60]. t=1 gives k=81>60. So, only k=21.

3. (4,15): k ≡0 mod4, k≡1 mod15.

Find k=15s +1 ≡0 mod4.

15s +1 ≡0 mod4 => 15s ≡-1 mod4 => (15 mod4)s ≡3 mod4 => (3)s ≡3 mod4 => s≡1 mod4.

So, s=4t +1.

Thus, k=15*(4t +1)+1=60t +16.

Within m=60, t=0 gives k=16, in range. t=1 gives 76>60.

So, k=16.

4. (5,12): k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod12.

Find k=12s +1 ≡0 mod5.

12s +1 ≡0 mod5 => 12s ≡-1 mod5 => (12 mod5)s ≡4 mod5 => (2)s≡4 mod5 => s≡2 mod5.

So, s=5t +2.

Thus, k=12*(5t +2)+1=60t +25.

Within m=60, t=0 gives k=25, in range. t=1 gives 85>60.

So, k=25.

5. (12,5): k≡0 mod12, k≡1 mod5.

Find k=5s +1 ≡0 mod12.

5s +1 ≡0 mod12 => 5s ≡-1 mod12 => 5s ≡11 mod12.

Multiplicative inverse of 5 mod12 is 5, since 5*5=25≡1 mod12.

So, s≡11*5 mod12 => s≡55 mod12 => s≡7 mod12.

So, s=12t +7.

Thus, k=5*(12t +7)+1=60t +36.

Within m=60, t=0 gives k=36, in range. t=1 gives 96>60.

So, k=36.

6. (15,4): k≡0 mod15, k≡1 mod4.

Find k=4s +1 ≡0 mod15.

4s +1 ≡0 mod15 =>4s≡-1 mod15 =>4s≡14 mod15.

Multiplicative inverse of 4 mod15 is 4, since 4*4=16≡1 mod15.

So, s≡14*4 mod15 =>s≡56 mod15 =>s≡11 mod15.

So, s=15t +11.

Thus, k=4*(15t +11)+1=60t +45.

Within m=60, t=0 gives k=45, in range. t=1 gives 105>60.

So, k=45.

7. (20,3): k≡0 mod20, k≡1 mod3.

Find k=3s +1 ≡0 mod20.

3s +1 ≡0 mod20 =>3s≡-1 mod20 =>3s≡19 mod20.

Inverse of 3 mod20 is 7, since 3*7=21≡1 mod20.

So, s≡19*7 mod20 =>s≡133 mod20 =>s≡13 mod20.

Thus, s=20t +13.

k=3*(20t +13)+1=60t +40.

Within m=60, t=0 gives k=40, in range. t=1 gives 100>60.

So, k=40.

8. (60,1): k≡0 mod60, k≡1 mod1.

k≡0 mod60 is k=60t, and k≡1 mod1 is always true. So, k=60t. In [8,60], t=1 gives k=60.

So, k=60.

So, in total, the valid k's are:21,16,25,36,45,40,60.

Wait, that's seven k's.

Wait, but we had eight coprime pairs, but one of them (1,60) gave k=1, which was invalid. So, seven solutions.

So, for m=60, we have seven b-eautiful numbers.

But seven is still less than ten, so we need a larger m.

Wait, perhaps m=105=3*5*7, which has three distinct prime factors. So, number of coprime pairs is 2^3=8.

Let's see how many solutions we get.

But let's compute it.

m=105.

The coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=105 and gcd(a,b)=1.

Divisors of 105:1,3,5,7,15,21,35,105.

So, the coprime pairs are:

(1,105), (3,35), (5,21), (7,15), (15,7), (21,5), (35,3), (105,1).

Each of these is a valid coprime pair.

Now, let's compute k for each pair, and see if they are in [ceiling(sqrt(106))=11,105].

1. (1,105): k ≡0 mod1, k≡1 mod105. So, k=105t +1. In [11,105], t=0 gives k=1 (invalid), t=1 gives 106>105 (invalid). So, no solution.

2. (3,35): k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod35.

Find k=35s +1 ≡0 mod3.

35s +1 ≡0 mod3 =>35s ≡-1 mod3 =>35 mod3=2, so 2s≡2 mod3 =>s≡1 mod3.

So, s=3t +1.

k=35*(3t +1)+1=105t +36.

Within m=105, t=0 gives k=36, which is in [11,105]. t=1 gives 141>105. So, k=36.

3. (5,21): k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod21.

k=21s +1 ≡0 mod5.

21s +1 ≡0 mod5 =>21s≡-1 mod5 =>21 mod5=1, so s≡-1 mod5 =>s≡4 mod5.

So, s=5t +4.

k=21*(5t +4)+1=105t +85.

Within m=105, t=0 gives k=85, in range. t=1 gives 190>105. So, k=85.

4. (7,15): k≡0 mod7, k≡1 mod15.

k=15s +1 ≡0 mod7.

15s +1 ≡0 mod7 =>15s≡-1 mod7 =>15 mod7=1, so s≡-1 mod7 =>s≡6 mod7.

s=7t +6.

k=15*(7t +6)+1=105t +91.

Within m=105, t=0 gives k=91, in range. t=1 gives 196>105. So, k=91.

5. (15,7): k≡0 mod15, k≡1 mod7.

k=7s +1 ≡0 mod15.

7s +1 ≡0 mod15 =>7s≡-1 mod15 =>7s≡14 mod15.

Multiplicative inverse of7 mod15 is 13, since 7*13=91≡1 mod15.

So, s≡14*13 mod15 =>14*13=182≡182-12*15=182-180=2 mod15.

So, s≡2 mod15.

Thus, s=15t +2.

k=7*(15t +2)+1=105t +15.

Within m=105, t=0 gives k=15, in range. t=1 gives 120>105. So, k=15.

6. (21,5):k≡0 mod21, k≡1 mod5.

k=5s +1 ≡0 mod21.

5s +1 ≡0 mod21 =>5s≡-1 mod21 =>5s≡20 mod21.

Multiplicative inverse of5 mod21 is 17, since 5*17=85≡1 mod21.

So, s≡20*17 mod21 =>20*17=340≡340-16*21=340-336=4 mod21.

So, s≡4 mod21.

Thus, s=21t +4.

k=5*(21t +4)+1=105t +21.

Within m=105, t=0 gives k=21, in range. t=1 gives 126>105. So, k=21.

7. (35,3):k≡0 mod35, k≡1 mod3.

k=3s +1 ≡0 mod35.

3s +1 ≡0 mod35 =>3s≡-1 mod35.

Inverse of3 mod35 is 24, since 3*24=72≡72-2*35=72-70=2≡ not 1. Wait, let's compute it properly.

Find x such that 3x ≡1 mod35.

3x ≡1 mod35.

Testing x=24: 3*24=72≡72-2*35=72-70=2≡2≠1.

x=12: 3*12=36≡1 mod35. Yes, 3*12=36≡1 mod35.

So, x=12 is the inverse.

Thus, s≡-1 *12 mod35 =>s≡-12≡23 mod35.

So, s=35t +23.

Thus, k=3*(35t +23)+1=105t +70.

Within m=105, t=0 gives k=70, in range. t=1 gives 175>105. So, k=70.

8. (105,1):k≡0 mod105, k≡1 mod1.

k=105t, and k≡1 mod1 is always true. So, k=105t. Within [11,105], t=1 gives k=105.

So, k=105.

So, the k's are:36,85,91,15,21,70,105.

Wait, that's seven k's. So, m=105 gives seven solutions.

Still less than ten.

Hmm, maybe we need a larger m with more coprime pairs. Let's try m=105*2=210, which has four distinct prime factors. As before, m=210, which has 16 coprime pairs.

But let's compute how many k's are in [ceiling(sqrt(211))=15,210].

But computing all 16 would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can estimate that for each coprime pair, there's a unique k in [1,210], and about half of them would be above 105, but we need k >=15.

But perhaps, for m=210, the number of solutions would be 16, but many of them will be above 15. Let me try to find a few.

Take the coprime pair (2,105): a=2, b=105.

k≡0 mod2, k≡1 mod105.

Find k=105s +1. Must be even. So, 105s +1 ≡0 mod2 =>105s≡1 mod2 =>s≡1 mod2.

So, s=2t +1.

k=105*(2t +1)+1=210t +106.

Within m=210, t=0 gives k=106, which is >=15. So, valid.

Similarly, for (3,70): a=3, b=70.

k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod70.

k=70s +1. 70s +1≡0 mod3 =>70s≡-1 mod3 =>1*s≡2 mod3 =>s≡2 mod3.

So, s=3t +2.

k=70*(3t +2)+1=210t +141.

t=0: k=141, valid.

Similarly, for (5,42): a=5, b=42.

k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod42.

k=42s +1≡0 mod5 =>42s≡-1 mod5 =>2s≡4 mod5 =>s≡2 mod5.

s=5t +2.

k=42*(5t +2)+1=210t +85.

t=0: k=85, valid.

Similarly, for (7,30): a=7, b=30.

k=30s +1≡0 mod7 =>30s≡-1 mod7 =>2s≡6 mod7 =>s≡3 mod7.

s=7t +3.

k=30*(7t +3)+1=210t +91.

t=0: k=91, valid.

Continuing, for (10,21): a=10, b=21.

k≡0 mod10, k≡1 mod21.

k=21s +1≡0 mod10 =>21s≡-1 mod10 =>1s≡9 mod10 =>s≡9 mod10.

s=10t +9.

k=21*(10t +9)+1=210t +190.

t=0: k=190, valid.

Similarly, for (14,15): a=14, b=15.

k≡0 mod14, k≡1 mod15.

k=15s +1≡0 mod14 =>15s≡-1 mod14 =>15 mod14=1, so s≡-1 mod14 =>s≡13 mod14.

s=14t +13.

k=15*(14t +13)+1=210t +200.

t=0: k=200, valid.

Similarly, for (15,14): a=15, b=14.

k≡0 mod15, k≡1 mod14.

k=14s +1≡0 mod15 =>14s≡-1 mod15 =>14s≡14 mod15 =>s≡1 mod15.

s=15t +1.

k=14*(15t +1)+1=210t +15.

t=0: k=15, valid.

Similarly, for (21,10): a=21, b=10.

k=10s +1≡0 mod21 =>10s≡-1 mod21.

10s≡20 mod21.

Inverse of10 mod21 is 19, since 10*19=190≡190-9*21=190-189=1 mod21.

So, s≡20*19 mod21 =>20*19=380≡380-18*21=380-378=2 mod21.

s≡2 mod21.

s=21t +2.

k=10*(21t +2)+1=210t +21.

t=0: k=21, valid.

Similarly, for (30,7): a=30, b=7.

k=7s +1≡0 mod30 =>7s≡-1 mod30.

7s≡29 mod30.

Inverse of7 mod30 is 13, since 7*13=91≡1 mod30.

So, s≡29*13 mod30 =>29*13=377≡377-12*30=377-360=17 mod30.

s=30t +17.

k=7*(30t +17)+1=210t +120.

t=0: k=120, valid.

Similarly, for (42,5): a=42, b=5.

k=5s +1≡0 mod42 =>5s≡-1 mod42.

5s≡41 mod42.

Inverse of5 mod42 is 17, since 5*17=85≡85-2*42=1 mod42.

So, s≡41*17 mod42.

41 mod42=41, 17 mod42=17.

41*17=697.

697 mod42: 42*16=672, 697-672=25.

So, s≡25 mod42.

s=42t +25.

k=5*(42t +25)+1=210t +126.

t=0: k=126, valid.

Similarly, for (70,3): a=70, b=3.

k=3s +1≡0 mod70 =>3s≡-1 mod70.

3s≡69 mod70.

Inverse of3 mod70 is 47, since 3*47=141≡1 mod70.

So, s≡69*47 mod70.

69 mod70=69, 47 mod70=47.

69*47=3243.

3243 mod70: 70*46=3220, 3243-3220=23.

So, s≡23 mod70.

s=70t +23.

k=3*(70t +23)+1=210t +70.

t=0: k=70, valid.

Similarly, for (105,2): a=105, b=2.

k=2s +1≡0 mod105.

2s≡-1 mod105 =>2s≡104 mod105.

Inverse of2 mod105 is 53, since 2*53=106≡1 mod105.

So, s≡104*53 mod105.

104 mod105=104, 53 mod105=53.

104*53=5512.

5512 mod105:

105*52=5520, 5512-5520= -8≡97 mod105.

So, s≡97 mod105.

s=105t +97.

k=2*(105t +97)+1=210t +195.

t=0: k=195, valid.

Finally, (210,1): a=210, b=1.

k=1s +1≡0 mod210 =>s≡-1 mod210.

s=210t -1.

k=210t -1 +1=210t.

Within m=210, t=1 gives k=210.

So, k=210, which is valid.

So, summarizing, for m=210, the k's are:

106,141,85,91,190,200,15,21,120,21,126,126,195,210.

Wait, wait, I think I might have duplicated some. Let me recount.

Wait, no, each coprime pair gives a unique k, so for m=210, we have 16 k's:

From the pairs:

1. (1,210):k=1 (invalid)
2. (2,105):k=106
3. (3,70):k=141
4. (5,42):k=85
5. (7,30):k=91
6. (10,21):k=190
7. (14,15):k=200
8. (15,14):k=15
9. (21,10):k=21
10. (30,7):k=120
11. (42,5):k=126
12. (70,3):k=70
13. (105,2):k=195
14. (210,1):k=210

Wait, that's 14 k's. Wait, perhaps I missed two.

Wait, the coprime pairs are 16, but one gives k=1 (invalid), and another gives k=210. So, 16-1=15, but one of them was invalid, so 14 valid.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me recount.

Each of the 16 coprime pairs would give a solution, but (1,210) gives k=1, which is invalid. So, 15 solutions.

Wait, but in my earlier list, I found 14 k's. So, perhaps I missed one.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the k's is beyond m=210, but no, all k's are within [15,210].

Wait, perhaps k=15 is from (15,14), which we included. Similarly, k=21 is from (21,10). So, maybe the total is 15.

But I think I might have miscounted. Regardless, for m=210, we have 15 or 16 solutions, which is way above ten.

But m=210 is quite large, so perhaps there's a smaller m with more than ten solutions.

Wait, let's think of m=60*3=180. Wait, but m=180 has prime factors 2^2, 3^2,5. So, t=3 distinct prime factors. So, number of coprime pairs is 2^3=8.

But let's compute the number of k's.

m=180.

The coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=180 and gcd(a,b)=1.

Divisors of 180:1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10,12,15,18,20,30,36,45,60,90,180.

Valid coprime pairs:

(1,180), (4,45), (5,36), (9,20), (12,15), (15,12), (20,9), (36,5), (45,4), (180,1).

Wait, but not all a's will have coprime b's.

Wait, for a=1: b=180, gcd=1.

a=2: b=90, gcd=2≠1.

a=3: b=60, gcd=3≠1.

a=4: b=45, gcd=1.

a=5: b=36, gcd=1.

a=6: b=30, gcd=6≠1.

a=9: b=20, gcd=1.

a=10: b=18, gcd=2≠1.

a=12: b=15, gcd=3≠1.

a=15: b=12, gcd=3≠1.

a=18: b=10, gcd=2≠1.

a=20: b=9, gcd=1.

a=30: b=6, gcd=6≠1.

a=36: b=5, gcd=1.

a=45: b=4, gcd=1.

a=60: b=3, gcd=3≠1.

a=90: b=2, gcd=2≠1.

a=180: b=1, gcd=1.

So, the valid coprime pairs are:

(1,180), (4,45), (5,36), (9,20), (20,9), (36,5), (45,4), (180,1).

So, eight pairs.

Now, let's compute the k's for each pair, ensuring they are in [ceiling(sqrt(181))=14, 180].

1. (1,180):k=1, invalid.

2. (4,45):k≡0 mod4, k≡1 mod45.

k=45s +1≡0 mod4.

45s +1 ≡0 mod4 =>45 mod4=1 =>s +1≡0 mod4 =>s≡3 mod4.

s=4t +3.

k=45*(4t +3)+1=180t +136.

Within m=180, t=0 gives k=136, valid. t=1 gives 316>180.

3. (5,36):k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod36.

k=36s +1≡0 mod5.

36 mod5=1 =>s +1≡0 mod5 =>s≡4 mod5.

s=5t +4.

k=36*(5t +4)+1=180t +145.

t=0: k=145, valid.

4. (9,20):k≡0 mod9, k≡1 mod20.

k=20s +1≡0 mod9.

20 mod9=2 =>2s +1≡0 mod9 =>2s≡8 mod9 =>s≡4 mod9.

s=9t +4.

k=20*(9t +4)+1=180t +81.

t=0: k=81, valid.

5. (20,9):k≡0 mod20, k≡1 mod9.

k=9s +1≡0 mod20.

9s +1≡0 mod20 =>9s≡-1 mod20 =>9s≡19 mod20.

Inverse of9 mod20 is 9, since 9*9=81≡1 mod20.

So, s≡19*9 mod20 =>171 mod20=17.

s=20t +17.

k=9*(20t +17)+1=180t +154.

t=0: k=154, valid.

6. (36,5):k≡0 mod36, k≡1 mod5.

k=5s +1≡0 mod36.

5s +1≡0 mod36 =>5s≡-1 mod36 =>5s≡35 mod36.

Inverse of5 mod36 is 29, since 5*29=145≡1 mod36.

So, s≡35*29 mod36.

35 mod36=35, 29 mod36=29.

35*29=1015.

1015 mod36: 36*28=1008, 1015-1008=7.

So, s≡7 mod36.

s=36t +7.

k=5*(36t +7)+1=180t +36.

t=0: k=36, valid.

7. (45,4):k≡0 mod45, k≡1 mod4.

k=4s +1≡0 mod45.

4s +1≡0 mod45 =>4s≡-1 mod45.

4s≡44 mod45.

Inverse of4 mod45 is 34, since 4*34=136≡136-3*45=136-135=1 mod45.

So, s≡44*34 mod45.

44 mod45=44, 34 mod45=34.

44*34=1496.

1496 mod45: 45*33=1485, 1496-1485=11.

s≡11 mod45.

s=45t +11.

k=4*(45t +11)+1=180t +45.

t=0: k=45, valid.

8. (180,1):k=180t, t=1 gives k=180, valid.

So, the k's are:136,145,81,154,36,45,180.

Wait, that's seven k's.

Wait, but we had eight coprime pairs, but one was invalid. So, seven solutions.

Still less than ten.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find a number m with more prime factors. Let's consider m=2*3*5*7*11=2310, which would have 2^5=32 coprime pairs, but m=2310 is very large, so perhaps the minimal m is somewhere in between.

Alternatively, perhaps m=120, which is 2^3*3*5. So, t=3, number of coprime pairs=8.

Wait, m=120.

Coprime pairs (a,b):

(1,120), (3,40), (5,24), (8,15), (15,8), (24,5), (40,3), (120,1).

So, eight pairs.

Compute k for each:

1. (1,120):k=1, invalid.

2. (3,40):k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod40.

k=40s +1≡0 mod3 =>40≡1 mod3 =>s +1≡0 mod3 =>s≡2 mod3.

s=3t +2.

k=40*(3t +2)+1=120t +81.

t=0: k=81, valid.

3. (5,24):k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod24.

k=24s +1≡0 mod5 =>24≡4 mod5 =>4s +1≡0 mod5 =>4s≡-1≡4 mod5 =>s≡1 mod5.

s=5t +1.

k=24*(5t +1)+1=120t +25.

t=0: k=25, valid.

4. (8,15):k≡0 mod8, k≡1 mod15.

k=15s +1≡0 mod8.

15≡7 mod8 =>7s +1≡0 mod8 =>7s≡-1≡7 mod8 =>s≡1 mod8.

s=8t +1.

k=15*(8t +1)+1=120t +16.

t=0: k=16, valid.

5. (15,8):k≡0 mod15, k≡1 mod8.

k=8s +1≡0 mod15.

8s +1≡0 mod15 =>8s≡-1≡14 mod15.

Inverse of8 mod15 is 2, since 8*2=16≡1 mod15.

So, s≡14*2 mod15 =>28≡13 mod15.

s=15t +13.

k=8*(15t +13)+1=120t +105.

t=0: k=105, valid.

6. (24,5):k≡0 mod24, k≡1 mod5.

k=5s +1≡0 mod24.

5s +1≡0 mod24 =>5s≡-1≡23 mod24.

Inverse of5 mod24 is 5, since 5*5=25≡1 mod24.

So, s≡23*5 mod24 =>115≡115-4*24=115-96=19 mod24.

s=24t +19.

k=5*(24t +19)+1=120t +96.

t=0: k=96, valid.

7. (40,3):k≡0 mod40, k≡1 mod3.

k=3s +1≡0 mod40.

3s +1≡0 mod40 =>3s≡-1≡39 mod40.

Inverse of3 mod40 is 27, since 3*27=81≡1 mod40.

So, s≡39*27 mod40.

39 mod40=39, 27 mod40=27.

39*27=1053.

1053 mod40: 40*26=1040, 1053-1040=13.

s≡13 mod40.

s=40t +13.

k=3*(40t +13)+1=120t +40.

t=0: k=40, valid.

8. (120,1):k=120t, t=1 gives k=120, valid.

So, the k's are:81,25,16,105,96,40,120.

That's seven k's.

Still seven, which is less than ten.

Wait, perhaps m=240, which is 2^4*3*5, so t=3. Number of coprime pairs=8.

But m=240, let's see:

The coprime pairs (a,b):

(1,240), (3,80), (5,48), (8,30), (15,16), (16,15), (30,8), (48,5), (80,3), (240,1).

So, ten pairs, but some may not be coprime.

Wait, checking:

(1,240): gcd=1.

(3,80): gcd=1.

(5,48): gcd=1.

(8,30): gcd=2≠1.

(15,16): gcd=1.

(16,15): same as above.

(30,8): same as (8,30), invalid.

(48,5): gcd=1.

(80,3): gcd=1.

(240,1): gcd=1.

So, valid coprime pairs are:

(1,240), (3,80), (5,48), (15,16), (48,5), (80,3), (240,1).

So, seven pairs.

Compute k's in [ceiling(sqrt(241))=16,240].

1. (1,240):k=1, invalid.

2. (3,80):k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod80.

k=80s +1≡0 mod3 =>80≡2 mod3 =>2s +1≡0 mod3 =>2s≡-1≡2 mod3 =>s≡1 mod3.

s=3t +1.

k=80*(3t +1)+1=240t +81.

t=0: k=81, valid.

3. (5,48):k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod48.

k=48s +1≡0 mod5 =>48≡3 mod5 =>3s +1≡0 mod5 =>3s≡-1≡4 mod5 =>s≡3 mod5.

s=5t +3.

k=48*(5t +3)+1=240t +145.

t=0: k=145, valid.

4. (15,16):k≡0 mod15, k≡1 mod16.

k=16s +1≡0 mod15.

16≡1 mod15 =>s +1≡0 mod15 =>s≡14 mod15.

s=15t +14.

k=16*(15t +14)+1=240t +225.

t=0: k=225, valid.

5. (48,5):k≡0 mod48, k≡1 mod5.

k=5s +1≡0 mod48.

5s +1≡0 mod48 =>5s≡-1≡47 mod48.

Inverse of5 mod48 is 19, since 5*19=95≡1 mod48.

So, s≡47*19 mod48.

47 mod48=47, 19 mod48=19.

47*19=893.

893 mod48: 48*18=864, 893-864=29.

s≡29 mod48.

s=48t +29.

k=5*(48t +29)+1=240t +146.

t=0: k=146, valid.

6. (80,3):k≡0 mod80, k≡1 mod3.

k=3s +1≡0 mod80.

3s +1≡0 mod80 =>3s≡-1≡79 mod80.

Inverse of3 mod80 is 53, since 3*53=159≡159-2*80=159-160=-1≡79 mod80. Wait, no, 3*53=159≡159-1*80=79≡-1 mod80.

Wait, that's not 1. Hmm, let's find the inverse correctly.

Find x such that 3x ≡1 mod80.

Trying x= 53: 3*53=159≡159-2*80= -1≡79 mod80.

Not 1. Next, x=54: 3*54=162≡162-2*80=2 mod80.

x=55: 165≡5 mod80.

x=56: 168≡8 mod80.

x=57: 171≡11 mod80.

x=58: 174≡14 mod80.

x=59: 177≡17 mod80.

x=60: 180≡20 mod80.

x=61: 183≡23 mod80.

x=62: 186≡26 mod80.

x=63: 189≡29 mod80.

x=64: 192≡32 mod80.

x=65: 195≡35 mod80.

x=66: 198≡38 mod80.

x=67: 201≡41 mod80.

x=68: 204≡44 mod80.

x=69: 207≡47 mod80.

x=70: 210≡50 mod80.

x=71: 213≡53 mod80.

x=72: 216≡56 mod80.

x=73: 219≡59 mod80.

x=74: 222≡62 mod80.

x=75: 225≡65 mod80.

x=76: 228≡68 mod80.

x=77: 231≡71 mod80.

x=78: 234≡74 mod80.

x=79: 237≡77 mod80.

x=80: 240≡0 mod80.

Hmm, seems like 3 doesn't have an inverse mod80? But that's not possible because 3 and80 are coprime. Wait, 3 and80 are coprime, so inverse exists.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me try the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Find x such that 3x +80y=1.

Using the algorithm:

80 = 26*3 + 2

3 = 1*2 +1

2=2*1 +0.

So, backtracking:

1=3 -1*2

But 2=80 -26*3.

So, 1=3 -1*(80 -26*3)=27*3 -1*80.

Thus, x=27, y=-1.

So, 3*27 ≡1 mod80.

So, inverse is 27 mod80.

Thus, s≡79*27 mod80.

79 mod80=79, 27 mod80=27.

79*27=2133.

2133 mod80: 80*26=2080, 2133-2080=53.

So, s≡53 mod80.

s=80t +53.

k=3*(80t +53)+1=240t +160.

t=0: k=160, valid.

7. (240,1):k=240t, t=1 gives k=240, valid.

So, the k's are:81,145,225,146,160,240.

That's six k's. Wait, but we had seven coprime pairs, but one gave k=1, invalid, so six solutions.

Still less than ten.

Hmm, perhaps I need to try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe instead of considering m as 210, which gave 15 solutions, but that's quite large, perhaps the minimal m is indeed 210, leading to b=211.

But in the example, b=13, which is manageable.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smaller m with more than ten solutions.

Wait, let's think of m=60, which had seven solutions. Maybe m=120 had seven, m=180 had seven, m=240 had six.

So, maybe the number of solutions increases when m is a multiple of many small primes, but the number of solutions doesn't increase beyond seven or eight until m=210.

So, perhaps the minimal m is 210, leading to b=211.

But to confirm, perhaps I can think of m=126.

Wait, m=126=2*3^2*7.

So, t=3, number of coprime pairs=8.

Compute the number of valid k's.

But m=126, k ranges from ceiling(sqrt(127))=12 to126.

Coprime pairs:

(1,126), (2,63), (3,42), (6,21), (7,18), (9,14), (14,9), (18,7), (21,6), (42,3), (63,2), (126,1).

Check which are coprime:

(1,126): gcd=1.

(2,63): gcd=1.

(3,42): gcd=3≠1.

(6,21): gcd=3≠1.

(7,18): gcd=1.

(9,14): gcd=1.

(14,9): same as above.

(18,7): same as above.

(21,6): gcd=3≠1.

(42,3): gcd=3≠1.

(63,2): gcd=1.

(126,1): gcd=1.

So, valid coprime pairs are:

(1,126), (2,63), (7,18), (9,14), (14,9), (18,7), (63,2), (126,1).

Total of eight pairs.

Compute k's:

1. (1,126):k=1, invalid.

2. (2,63):k≡0 mod2, k≡1 mod63.

k=63s +1≡0 mod2 =>63≡1 mod2 =>s +1≡0 mod2 =>s≡1 mod2.

s=2t +1.

k=63*(2t +1)+1=126t +64.

t=0: k=64, valid.

3. (7,18):k≡0 mod7, k≡1 mod18.

k=18s +1≡0 mod7.

18≡4 mod7 =>4s +1≡0 mod7 =>4s≡-1≡6 mod7.

Inverse of4 mod7 is 2, since 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, s≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

s=7t +5.

k=18*(7t +5)+1=126t +91.

t=0: k=91, valid.

4. (9,14):k≡0 mod9, k≡1 mod14.

k=14s +1≡0 mod9.

14≡5 mod9 =>5s +1≡0 mod9 =>5s≡-1≡8 mod9.

Inverse of5 mod9 is 2, since 5*2=10≡1 mod9.

So, s≡8*2=16≡7 mod9.

s=9t +7.

k=14*(9t +7)+1=126t +99.

t=0: k=99, valid.

5. (14,9):k≡0 mod14, k≡1 mod9.

k=9s +1≡0 mod14.

9≡9 mod14 =>9s +1≡0 mod14 =>9s≡-1≡13 mod14.

Inverse of9 mod14 is 3, since 9*3=27≡13≡-1 mod14. Wait, that's not 1.

Wait, 9*5=45≡3 mod14.

9*11=99≡99-7*14=99-98=1 mod14. So, inverse is11.

So, s≡13*11 mod14.

13 mod14=13, 11 mod14=11.

13*11=143≡143-10*14=143-140=3 mod14.

s≡3 mod14.

s=14t +3.

k=9*(14t +3)+1=126t +28.

t=0: k=28, valid.

6. (18,7):k≡0 mod18, k≡1 mod7.

k=7s +1≡0 mod18.

7s +1≡0 mod18 =>7s≡-1≡17 mod18.

Inverse of7 mod18 is 5, since 7*5=35≡17≡-1 mod18. Wait, that's not 1.

Wait, 7*5=35≡17 mod18.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's compute the inverse correctly.

Find x such that7x ≡1 mod18.

7*5=35≡17 mod18.

7*11=77≡77-4*18=77-72=5 mod18.

7*13=91≡91-5*18=91-90=1 mod18.

So, inverse is13.

Thus, s≡17*13 mod18.

17 mod18=17,13 mod18=13.

17*13=221≡221-12*18=221-216=5 mod18.

s≡5 mod18.

s=18t +5.

k=7*(18t +5)+1=126t +36.

t=0: k=36, valid.

7. (63,2):k≡0 mod63, k≡1 mod2.

k=2s +1≡0 mod63.

2s +1≡0 mod63 =>2s≡-1≡62 mod63.

Inverse of2 mod63 is32, since 2*32=64≡1 mod63.

So, s≡62*32 mod63.

62 mod63=62,32 mod63=32.

62*32=1984.

1984 mod63: 63*31=1953,1984-1953=31.

s≡31 mod63.

s=63t +31.

k=2*(63t +31)+1=126t +63.

t=0: k=63, valid.

8. (126,1):k=126t, t=1 gives k=126, valid.

So, the k's are:64,91,99,28,36,63,126.

That's seven k's.

Still seven.

Hmm, maybe m=210 is indeed the minimal m where the number of solutions exceeds ten.

Given that for m=210, we have 15 or16 solutions, which is more than ten.

So, the minimal b would be m+1=210+1=211.

But to confirm, perhaps m=126 has seven, m=180 has seven, m=240 has six, m=210 has 15.

So, I think the minimal b is 211.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding the Conditions**:
   - \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), so \( n = d_1 \cdot b + d_0 \), where \( 1 \leq d_1 < b \) and \( 0 \leq d_0 < b \).
   - The sum of the digits \( d_1 + d_0 \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \).

2. **Formulating the Equation**:
   - From \( n = d_1 \cdot b + d_0 \) and \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \), squaring the second equation gives:
     \[
     (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 \cdot b + d_0
     \]
   - Rearranging:
     \[
     d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 - d_1b - d_0 = 0
     \]

3. **Analyzing Possible Values**:
   - For each base \( b \), we consider \( m = b - 1 \) and look for integers \( k \) such that \( m \) divides \( k(k - 1) \). Each valid \( k \) corresponds to a \( b \)-eautiful number.
   - The number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers increases with the number of distinct prime factors of \( m \), as each factor contributes to more valid \( k \) values.

4. **Finding the Minimal \( b \)**:
   - After testing smaller values and analyzing the number of valid \( k \) values for various \( m \), it is determined that \( m = 210 \) (which has four distinct prime factors) yields the highest number of valid \( k \) values, exceeding ten.
   - Therefore, the smallest \( b \) is \( m + 1 = 211 \).

### Final Answer:
The least integer \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is \(\boxed{211}\).
