Okay, so Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and times, and I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the time she spends in the coffee shop.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think I should probably set up some equations based on the information given.

First, when she walks at a speed of s km/h, her total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. But wait, time is in hours and minutes. I should convert everything to the same units to make it easier. Let me convert t to hours since the walking time is given in hours.

So, t minutes is t/60 hours. Therefore, the total time for the walk and coffee break is 4 hours, which is equal to the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop. The time she spends walking is distance divided by speed, so that's 9 km divided by s km/h, which is 9/s hours. So, the equation would be:

9/s + t/60 = 4

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, it says when she walks at s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes. So actually, the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes, because the total time is 4 hours which includes walking and coffee. Oh, so that would make the walking time (4 hours minus t minutes). But I have to convert t to hours for the equation.

So, t minutes is t/60 hours, so the walking time is (4 - t/60) hours. But walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed, which is 9/s. So, equation one is:

9/s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, the second scenario is when she walks at s+2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Let me convert 2 hours and 24 minutes into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.

Again, the walking time is (2.4 - t/60) hours. And the walking time is also 9/(s+2). So the equation is:

9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can solve these two equations to find s and t, and then use those values to find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me write the equations again:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - t/60
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

Hmm, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t. Wait, actually, maybe I should express t from both equations and set them equal.

From equation 1:

t/60 = 4 - 9/s
=> t = 60*(4 - 9/s)

From equation 2:

t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)
=> t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s + 2))

Since both expressions equal t, I can set them equal to each other:

60*(4 - 9/s) = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s + 2))

I can divide both sides by 60 to simplify:

4 - 9/s = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

Now, let's bring all terms to one side:
