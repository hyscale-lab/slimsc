Alright, so I've got this logarithm problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem says:

There exist real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, such that
\[
\log_x(y^x) = \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]
I need to find \( xy \).

Hmm, okay. So both logarithmic expressions are equal to 10. Maybe I can set each of them equal to 10 and then solve for \( x \) and \( y \).

Let me recall some logarithm rules. The logarithm \( \log_b(a^c) \) is equal to \( c \cdot \log_b(a) \). So, perhaps I can use that to simplify both expressions.

Starting with the first equation:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10.
\]
Using the logarithm power rule, this becomes:
\[
x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10.
\]
Wait, but \( \log_x(y) \) is the exponent to which I must raise \( x \) to get \( y \). So, if \( \log_x(y) = k \), then \( x^k = y \). Let me denote \( \log_x(y) \) as \( k \) for simplicity. Then the first equation becomes:
\[
x \cdot k = 10.
\]
So, \( xk = 10 \). But since \( k = \log_x(y) \), which is \( \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} \) (using change of base formula), I can write:
\[
k = \frac{\ln y}{\ln x}.
\]
Therefore, the first equation \( xk = 10 \) can be rewritten as:
\[
x \cdot \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = 10.
\]
Simplifying, the \( x \) in the numerator and the \( \ln x \) in the denominator can be written as \( \frac{\ln y}{(\ln x)/x} \). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let me consider both equations together. The first equation is:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10,
\]
and the second is:
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]
Let me write both using the power rule.

First equation becomes:
\[
x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10,
\]
which I can denote as Equation (1):
\[
x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10.
\]
Second equation becomes:
\[
4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10,
\]
denote as Equation (2):
\[
4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10.
\]
Hmm, maybe I can express both logs in terms of each other. Let me recall that \( \log_b(a) = 1 / \log_a(b) \). So, \( \log_x(y) = 1 / \log_y(x) \). Let me let \( k = \log_x(y) \). Then \( \log_y(x) = 1/k \).

Substituting into Equations (1) and (2):

Equation (1):
\[
x \cdot k = 10.
\]
Equation (2):
\[
4y \cdot \left( \frac{1}{k} \right) = 10.
\]
So Equation (2) becomes:
\[
\frac{4y}{k} = 10.
\]
Simplify Equation (2):
\[
4y = 10k \implies y = \frac{10k}{4} = \frac{5k}{2}.
\]
Now, from Equation (1), \( x = \frac{10}{k} \).

So now I have expressions for both \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( k \):
\[
x = \frac{10}{k},
\]
\[
y = \frac{5k}{2}.
\]
Now, I also know that \( k = \log_x(y) \). Since \( k = \log_x(y) \), this can be rewritten using logarithms:
\[
k = \frac{\ln y}{\ln x}.
\]
But I have expressions for \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( k \), so let's substitute those in.

Substituting \( x = 10/k \) and \( y = (5k)/2 \):

\[
k = \frac{\ln \left( \frac{5k}{2} \right)}{\ln \left( \frac{10}{k} \right)}.
\]
Hmm, that's a complicated equation, but maybe we can simplify it.

Let me denote \( A = \ln \left( \frac{5k}{2} \right) \) and \( B = \ln \left( \frac{10}{k} \right) \), so the equation becomes \( k = A/B \).

Alternatively, perhaps I can take both sides as exponents of \( e \) to eliminate the logarithms, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, cross-multiplying gives:

\[
k \cdot \ln \left( \frac{10}{k} \right) = \ln \left( \frac{5k}{2} \right).
\]
Let me expand the logarithms.

First, \( \ln \left( \frac{10}{k} \right) = \ln 10 - \ln k \).

Similarly, \( \ln \left( \frac{5k}{2} \right) = \ln 5 + \ln k - \ln 2 \).

Wait, no: \( \ln(ab) = \ln a + \ln b \), so \( \ln(5k/2) = \ln(5k) - \ln 2 = \ln 5 + \ln k - \ln 2 \).

Alternatively, maybe I can write \( \ln (5k/2) = \ln 5 + \ln k - \ln 2 \).

So, going back, the equation is:

\[
k (\ln 10 - \ln k) = \ln 5 + \ln k - \ln 2.
\]
Let me denote \( \ln 2 \) as \( a \), \( \ln 5 \) as \( b \), and \( \ln 10 \) as \( c \). Since \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \), \( c = \ln 2 + \ln 5 = a + b \).

So, substituting these:

\[
k (c - \ln k) = b + \ln k - a.
\]
Expanding the left side:

\[
kc - k \ln k = b + \ln k - a.
\]
Bring all terms to one side:

\[
kc - k \ln k - b - \ln k + a = 0.
\]
Let me factor terms with \( \ln k \):

\[
kc + a - b - (k + 1) \ln k = 0.
\]
Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe it's better to substitute numbers in for \( a, b, c \).

Wait, \( a = \ln 2 ≈ 0.6931 \), \( b = \ln 5 ≈ 1.6094 \), and \( c = \ln 10 ≈ 2.3026 \).

So substituting these values:

\[
k (2.3026) - (k + 1) \ln k + (0.6931 - 1.6094) = 0.
\]
Wait, not sure if that's correct. Let me re-express this:

Wait, the equation is:

\[
kc + a -
