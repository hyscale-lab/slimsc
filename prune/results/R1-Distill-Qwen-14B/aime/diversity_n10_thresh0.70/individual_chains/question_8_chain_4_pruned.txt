Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me write down what I know. The first equation is a linear equation, and the second one is a bit more complicated. It looks like a combination of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Let me think about the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is symmetric, so perhaps I can factor it in terms of (a + b + c). Let me see:

If I factor a²b + a²c, that's a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So the entire expression can be written as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

So the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay, maybe I can expand this expression to see if it simplifies. Let's try that:

a²*300 - a³ + b²*300 - b³ + c²*300 - c³ = 6,000,000.

Which can be written as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I remember that there are some identities involving sums of variables and their cubes. Let me think. One identity I know is that a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca). Maybe this can help.

But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)² and the pairwise products.

Yes, because (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, then a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

So substituting back into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) = 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) = 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca).

Then, the entire equation becomes:

[27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca)] - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, moving the numbers around:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0.

Which simplifies to:

21,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0.

Hmm, that's 21,000,000 = 600(ab + bc + ca) + (a³ + b³ + c³).

I wonder if I can find a relationship between ab + bc + ca and a³ + b³ + c³.

Another identity I remember is that:

a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca).

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe I can find expressions for ab + bc + ca and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of each other.

Wait, let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = a³ + b³ + c³.

Then, from earlier, we have a² + b² + c²
