Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the infimum of BD squared, or the least upper bound for BD squared.

First, let me recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are actually perpendicular. Let me confirm: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property. So, the diagonals intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.

Given that the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, which is a standard hyperbola. For hyperbola, we have certain properties, like the vertices, foci, asymptotes, etc. The vertices are at (±√20, 0), which simplifies to (±2√5, 0). The foci are at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². So, a² is 20, b² is 24, so c² = 44, so c is 2√11. So, foci at (±2√11, 0).

But maybe I don't need the foci right now. Let's think about the rhombus. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I denote the diagonals as AC and BD, then the midpoint of AC is the origin, and the midpoint of BD is the origin. So, points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are points B and D. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v).

But wait, no. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes. Hmm. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, but they can be at any angle. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals bisect each other, each
