Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Hmm, okay. So, the sphere has to enclose all possible such boxes, and I'm looking for the minimal radius squared, which will be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then, I need to find p + q.

First, I should probably visualize the problem. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, say a, b, c. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere has to touch the farthest corners of the box, right? So, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the box.

The space diagonal d of the box can be calculated using the formula d = sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is half of that, so r = (1/2) * sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, r² would be (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, to find the minimal r², I need to find the minimal value of (a² + b² + c²) given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Wait, no. Wait a minute. The problem says the radius is the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in B. So, actually, we're looking for the maximum value of the space diagonal across all boxes in B because the sphere must contain all such boxes. Therefore, the minimal sphere that works for all boxes must have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B divided by 2. So, actually, I need to maximize a² + b² + c² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Because if the space diagonal is larger for some box, then the sphere must be large enough to contain that box. So, to find the minimal sphere that contains all boxes, I need the maximum space diagonal, so r² would be (max (a² + b² + c²))/4.

Therefore, my task is to maximize a² + b² + c² subject to the constraints:

Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54
Volume: abc = 23

So, I need to maximize f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c² given these two constraints.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using Lagrange multipliers, where I can set up the function to maximize with the given constraints. Alternatively, maybe I can express two variables in terms of the third and then use calculus to find the maximum. But with three variables, that might get complex. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some inequalities or optimization techniques. Let me recall that for positive real numbers a, b, c, certain inequalities relate the surface area, volume, and the sum of squares.

First, let me write down the constraints:

1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 → ab + bc + ac = 27
2. abc = 23

I need to maximize a² + b² + c².

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). From this, since ab + bc + ac is known, if I can find a + b + c, then I can find a² + b² + c².

Wait, but a + b + c isn't given. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of a + b + c and ab + bc + ac. Because (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, a² + b² + c² =
