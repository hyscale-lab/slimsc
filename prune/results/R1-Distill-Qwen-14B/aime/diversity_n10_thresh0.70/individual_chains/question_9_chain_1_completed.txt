Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let's write down what's given. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. The second is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Both logs are equal to 10, so maybe I can set them equal to each other or find expressions for x and y separately.

Let me start with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So applying that here, x^{10} = y^x. That's from the first equation.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. So y^{10} = x^{4y}. Okay, so now I have two equations:

1) x^{10} = y^x
2) y^{10} = x^{4y}

Hmm, so I have a system of two equations with two variables. Maybe I can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute into the second. Or find a relationship between x and y.

Let me see. From the first equation, x^{10} = y^x. Let's take natural logarithm on both sides to make it easier to handle exponents. So ln(x^{10}) = ln(y^x). That simplifies to 10 ln x = x ln y. So 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, from the second equation: y^{10} = x^{4y}. Taking natural log again: ln(y^{10}) = ln(x^{4y}) => 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now I have:

1) 10 ln x = x ln y
2) 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, so I can perhaps express ln y from the first equation and substitute into the second.

From equation 1: ln y = (10 ln x)/x

Plug that into equation 2: 10 * (10 ln x)/x = 4y ln x

Simplify: (100 ln x)/x = 4y ln x

Wait, since ln x is not zero (because x > 1, so ln x > 0), I can divide both sides by ln x:

100/x = 4y

So, 100/x = 4y => y = (100)/(4x) = 25/x

So y = 25/x.

Now, let's substitute y = 25/x into equation 1, which was 10 ln x = x ln y.

So, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - lnx.

So substituting into equation 1:

10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x)

Let me write that out:

10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x

Bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 = 0

Factor out ln x from the first two terms:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln25 = 0

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms.

Let me write it as:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln25

So ln x = [x ln25] / (10 + x)

Hmm, perhaps I can exponentiate both sides to get rid of the logarithm.

So, x = e^{ [x ln25] / (10 + x) }

Alternatively, that's x = (25)^{ x / (10 + x) }

Because e^{ln25} is 25, so e^{x ln25 / (10+x)} = 25^{x/(10+x)}.

So, x = 25^{x/(10 + x)}.

Hmm, tricky. Maybe take natural log again?

Wait, but I just did that. Alternatively, perhaps express 25 as 5^2.

So 25 = 5^2, so 25^{x/(10+x)} = (5^2)^{x/(10+x)} = 5^{2x/(10+x)}.

So x = 5^{2x/(10+x)}.

Hmm, maybe set z = x/(10 + x). Then x = z(10 + x) => x = 10 z + x z => x - x z = 10 z => x(1 - z) =10 z => x = (10 z)/(1 - z). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let's try taking logarithms on both sides again.

Take ln x = (x ln25)/(10 + x). Wait, that's where we were before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps make a substitution. Let t = x, so equation is ln t = (t ln25)/(10 + t).

Hmm, not sure. Maybe think about it as a function f(t) = ln t - (t ln25)/(10 + t) = 0. Find t where this is zero.

But that seems complicated. Maybe try plugging in some numbers to see if we can find x.

Wait, since x and y are both greater than 1, and y =25/x, so if x is greater than 1, y is 25/x, which is also greater than 1. So x must be less than 25, because y=25/x >1 implies x <25.

So x is between 1 and 25.

Let me try x=5. Let's see.

If x=5, then y=25/5=5. So y=5.

Check the first equation: log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) =5. But we need it to be 10. So that's not good.

Hmm, so x=5 gives us 5, but we need 10. So maybe x is another value.

Wait, perhaps x=25? If x=25, y=25/25=1, but y must be greater than 1, so that's not allowed.

Hmm, maybe x=25/ something. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe assume that x and y are the same? Let's see. If x=y, then from y=25/x, we get x=25/x => x^2=25 => x=5. But as before, that gives log_5(5^5) =5, which doesn't equal 10. So that's not the case.

So, perhaps x and y are different.

Wait, let's think about the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10.

Which is equivalent to y^x =x^{10}, as we had before.

Similarly, the second equation is y^{10} =x^{4y}.

So, perhaps take the ratio of these two equations.

From equation 1: y^x =x^{10}

From equation 2: y^{10}=x^{4y}

Divide equation 1 by equation 2:

(y^x)/(y^{10}) = (x^{10})/(x^{4y})

Simplify:

y^{x -10} = x^{10 -4y}

Hmm. So, y^{x-10} = x^{10 -4y}

But from earlier, we have y=25/x. So let's substitute that.

So, (25/x)^{x -10} = x^{10 -4*(25/x)}

Simplify the exponents:

Left side: (25/x)^{x-10}

Right side: x^{10 - 100/x}

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe take natural logs.

Take ln of both sides:

ln[(25/x)^{x-10}] = ln[x^{10 -100/x}]

Which simplifies to:

(x-10) ln(25/x) = (10 - 100/x) ln x

Hmm, let's expand ln(25/x) as ln25 - lnx.

So:

(x -10)(ln25 - ln x) = (10 -100/x) ln x

Let's expand the left side:

(x -10) ln25 - (x -10) ln x = (10 - 100/x) ln x

Bring all terms to left side:

(x -10) ln25 - (x -10) lnx - (10 - 100/x) lnx =0

Factor out the lnx terms:

(x -10) ln25 - [ (x -10) + (10 -100/x) ] lnx =0

Simplify the coefficient of lnx:

(x -10) + (10 -100/x) = x -10 +10 -100/x = x -100/x

So, equation becomes:

(x -10) ln25 - (x -100/x) lnx =0

Hmm. Let's write that as:

(x -10) ln25 = (x - 100/x) lnx

So,

ln25 = [ (x -100/x) / (x -10) ] lnx

Hmm, this is getting more complicated. Maybe we can find a substitution. Let me set t = x -10. But not sure.

Alternatively, multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator.

Wait, let me see.

Wait, the equation is:

(x -10) ln25 = (x - 100/x) lnx

Multiply both sides by x:

x(x -10) ln25 = (x^2 -100) lnx

Hmm, x^2 -100 factors into (x-10)(x+10). So:

x(x -10) ln25 = (x -10)(x +10) lnx

Assuming x ≠10, we can divide both sides by (x -10):

x ln25 = (x +10) lnx

So,

x ln25 = (x +10) ln x

Hmm, this is a simpler equation. So,

x ln25 = (x +10) ln x

Let me rearrange terms:

x ln25 - x lnx = 10 lnx

Factor x:

x (ln25 - lnx) =10 lnx

Hmm, perhaps:

x ln(25/x) =10 lnx

Wait, ln(25/x) = ln25 - lnx, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps write this as:

x ln(25/x) =10 lnx

Let me write 25/x as (5^2)/x. Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, let's write ln(25/x) as ln25 - lnx.

Wait, so:

x (ln25 - lnx) =10 lnx

Expand left side:

x ln25 - x lnx =10 lnx

Bring all terms to left:

x ln25 - x lnx -10 lnx =0

Factor lnx terms:

x ln25 - lnx (x +10) =0

So,

x ln25 = lnx (x +10)

Hmm, same as before. Maybe try substituting z = lnx.

Let me set z = lnx. Then, x = e^z.

Substitute into equation:

e^z ln25 = z (e^z +10)

Hmm, this looks transcendental. Not sure if it can be solved algebraically.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a value of z that satisfies this equation.

Let me think. Let's try some integer values for z.

Wait, from before, we saw that x is between 1 and 25. So z = lnx is between 0 and ln25 (~3.218).

Let me assume z is an integer, maybe. Let's try z=2, which would make x=e^2≈7.389.

Check if x ln25 = z(x +10).

Compute x ln25: 7.389 * ln25 ≈7.389 *3.218≈23.75.

Compute z(x +10):2*(7.389 +10)=2*(17.389)=34.778.

Not equal. So z=2 is not solution.

Try z=1: x=e≈2.718.

x ln25≈2.718*3.218≈8.75.

z(x+10)=1*(2.718+10)=12.718. Not equal.

z=3: x=e^3≈20.085.

x ln25≈20.085 *3.218≈64.6.

z(x +10)=3*(20.085 +10)=3*30.085≈90.255. Not equal.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps z= ln something.

Wait, maybe try z= ln5, since 25 is 5^2. ln5≈1.609.

Let me see:

x = e^{ln5}=5.

Wait, we tried x=5 earlier, and it didn't satisfy the equation. Let's check.

x=5, z=ln5. So,

Left side:5 * ln25=5 *3.218≈16.09.

Right side:z(x +10)= ln5*(5 +10)=1.609 *15≈24.135.

Not equal. So z=ln5 is not the solution.

Hmm, perhaps z=ln25? z=ln25≈3.218.

x= e^{3.218}=25.

But y=25/x=1, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe try z= ln(25/10)=ln2.5≈0.916.

x= e^{0.916}≈2.5.

Check:

Left side: 2.5 * ln25≈2.5 *3.218≈8.045.

Right side: z(x +10)=0.916*(2.5+10)=0.916*12.5≈11.45. Not equal.

Hmm. Maybe not an integer or a nice multiple.

Alternatively, perhaps think about this equation:

x ln25 = (x +10) lnx

Let me write this as (x +10)/x = ln25 / lnx.

So,

1 + 10/x = ln25 / lnx

Hmm, maybe let t =10/x. Then x=10/t.

So,

1 + t = ln25 / ln(10/t)

But ln(10/t) = ln10 - ln t. So,

1 + t = ln25 / (ln10 - ln t)

Hmm, this is still complicated. Maybe plug in some t values.

Wait, t=10/x. Since x is between 1 and 25, t is between 1/25 and 10.

Let me try t=2. So x=5.

1 +2 =3.

ln25 / (ln10 - ln2)≈3.218/(2.302 -0.693)=3.218/(1.609)=≈2.000.

So left side is 3, right side≈2. Not equal.

t=2.5: x=4.

1+2.5=3.5.

ln25/(ln10 - ln2.5)=3.218/(2.302 -0.916)=3.218/1.386≈2.318.

3.5≈2.318. Not equal.

t=1: x=10.

1 +1=2.

ln25/(ln10 - ln1)=3.218/(2.302 -0)=3.218/2.302≈1.4.

2≈1.4. Not equal.

t=1.25: x=8.

1+1.25=2.25.

ln25/(ln10 - ln1.25)=3.218/(2.302 -0.223)=3.218/(2.079)=≈1.548.

2.25≈1.548. Not equal.

t=3: x≈3.333.

1 +3=4.

ln25/(ln10 - ln3)=3.218/(2.302 -1.098)=3.218/1.204≈2.672.

4≈2.672. Not equal.

t=0.5: x=20.

1+0.5=1.5.

ln25/(ln10 - ln0.5)=3.218/(2.302 - (-0.693))=3.218/(2.302 +0.693)=3.218/2.995≈1.075.

1.5≈1.075. Not equal.

Hmm, not matching. Maybe t= something else.

Wait, maybe t=1. Let's try t=1 again.

Wait, t=1 is x=10. Which gives 2=approx1.4, which is less.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a bit tricky and requires setting variables in a way that allows substitution.

Wait, going back to the original substitution, y=25/x.

So from equation1: y^x =x^{10}.

Substituting y=25/x, we get:

(25/x)^x =x^{10}

Which is 25^x /x^x =x^{10}

So, 25^x =x^{10 +x}

Take ln both sides:

x ln25 = (10 +x) lnx

Which is the same equation we had before.

Hmm, perhaps set 25^x =x^{x +10}

Take both sides to some power or make substitution.

Let me write 25 as 5^2.

So,

(5^2)^x =x^{x +10} =>5^{2x}=x^{x +10}

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, take both sides as exponents with base x.

Wait, let me think. Maybe express both sides with the same base.

Wait, 5^{2x} can be written as (5^2)^x=25^x, which is where we came from.

Alternatively, perhaps take log base 5.

Taking log base5 of both sides:

log5(5^{2x})=log5(x^{x +10})

Which simplifies to:

2x = (x +10) log5 x

Hmm, so 2x = (x +10) log5 x

Hmm, that's another way to write it, but not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, express log5 x as (lnx)/(ln5).

So,

2x = (x +10) (lnx)/(ln5)

Multiply both sides by ln5:

2x ln5 = (x +10) lnx

Which is the same as equation we had earlier.

Hmm, same equation. So, it's not helping.

Alternatively, maybe think of x as 5^k, where k is some exponent.

Let me set x=5^k, so lnx= k ln5.

Then, let's substitute into the equation:

2x ln5 = (x +10) lnx

So,

2*(5^k) ln5 = (5^k +10)*(k ln5)

Divide both sides by ln5:

2*5^k = (5^k +10)*k

So,

2*5^k =k*5^k +10k

Bring all terms to left:

2*5^k -k*5^k -10k =0

Factor 5^k:

5^k (2 -k) -10k=0

Hmm, 5^k (2 -k) =10k

Let me write this as:

5^k = [10k]/(2 -k)

Hmm, so 5^k equals 10k/(2 -k). Now, since x=5^k>1, and x<25, so k is between 0 and 2.

Because when k=2, x=25.

So, k is in (0,2).

So, let's try k=1:

Left side:5^1=5.

Right side:10*1/(2-1)=10/1=10. 5≠10.

k=0.5: x=√5≈2.236.

Left:5^0.5≈2.236.

Right:10*(0.5)/(2-0.5)=5 /1.5≈3.333. Not equal.

k=1.5: x=5^1.5≈11.18.

Left:11.18.

Right:10*(1.5)/(2-1.5)=15 /0.5=30. 11.18≠30.

k=0.8: x≈5^0.8≈3.98.

Left:≈3.98.

Right:10*0.8/(2-0.8)=8 /1.2≈6.666. Not equal.

k=0.6: x≈5^0.6≈3.311.

Right:10*0.6/(2-0.6)=6/1.4≈4.285. Left≈3.311. Not equal.

k=0.4: x≈5^0.4≈2.378.

Right:10*0.4/(2-0.4)=4/1.6=2.5. Left≈2.378. Close, but not equal.

k=0.35: compute x=5^0.35≈ e^{0.35 ln5}≈e^{0.35*1.609}≈e^{0.563}≈1.757.

Right:10*0.35/(2 -0.35)=3.5/1.65≈2.115. Left≈1.757. Not equal.

k=0.25: x≈5^0.25≈sqrt(sqrt(5))≈1.495.

Right:10*0.25/(2 -0.25)=2.5/1.75≈1.428. Left≈1.495. Close, but not equal.

k=0.2: x≈5^0.2≈1.379.

Right:10*0.2/(2-0.2)=2/1.8≈1.111. Left≈1.379. Not equal.

k=0.75: x≈5^0.75≈5^(3/4)= (5^(1/4))^3≈(1.495)^3≈3.343.

Right:10*0.75/(2 -0.75)=7.5/1.25=6. So, left≈3.343≠6.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe try k= something else.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe try a substitution.

Wait, let me go back to the equation:

x ln25 = (x +10) lnx.

Let me try to write this as:

lnx = [x ln25]/(x +10)

Hmm, so lnx = [x ln25]/(x +10)

So, x = e^{ [x ln25]/(x +10) }

Hmm, perhaps define a function f(x) = e^{ [x ln25]/(x +10) }, and find x where f(x)=x.

This is equivalent to solving f(x) -x =0.

But this is a transcendental equation, which likely doesn't have a closed-form solution. So perhaps we need to use numerical methods.

Wait, but since this is a competition problem, perhaps x and y are integers or have some nice fractional exponents. Maybe think of x and y as 25 and 5, but we saw that x=5 gives y=5, but that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps x=25/2=12.5.

Let me check.

x=12.5, y=25/12.5=2.

Check first condition: log_{12.5}(2^{12.5})=10?

Compute log_{12.5}(2^{12.5}).

Express 12.5 as 5^2.5 / something? Wait, 12.5=100/8=5^2*(2^-3).

Alternatively, 12.5=5^2.5 / 2^something. Maybe not helpful.

Compute log_{12.5}(2^{12.5})=12.5 * log_{12.5}(2).

Express log_{12.5}(2)= ln2 / ln12.5.

Compute ln2≈0.693, ln12.5≈2.531.

So log_{12.5}(2)=0.693/2.531≈0.274.

So 12.5 *0.274≈3.425, which is not 10.

So that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that x and y are integers. Maybe they aren't.

Alternatively, perhaps take the ratio of the two equations.

From equation1: y^x =x^{10}

From equation2: y^{10}=x^{4y}

Divide equation1 by equation2:

(y^x)/(y^{10}) = (x^{10})/(x^{4y})

Simplify:

y^{x-10}=x^{10-4y}

Hmm, take natural logs:

(x-10) ln y = (10 -4y) ln x

But from earlier, we have y=25/x. So substitute:

(x-10) ln(25/x)= (10 -4*(25/x)) ln x

Simplify:

(x-10)(ln25 - ln x) = (10 -100/x) lnx

Which is what we had earlier. So same equation.

Hmm, perhaps I can let u = lnx. So then, lny = ln(25/x)=ln25 - u.

So, substituting into the equation:

(x -10)(ln25 - u) = (10 -100/x) u

But x = e^u.

So,

(e^u -10)(ln25 -u) = (10 -100/e^u) u

This seems complicated, but maybe expand the left side:

e^u (ln25 -u) -10(ln25 -u) =10u - (100/e^u)u

Bring all terms to left:

e^u (ln25 -u) -10(ln25 -u) -10u + (100/e^u)u=0

Hmm, this is getting too messy. Maybe not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the original equations again.

From equation1: y^x =x^{10} => y= x^{10/x}

From equation2: y^{10}=x^{4y} => y= x^{(4y)/10}=x^{(2y)/5}

So, from equation1, y= x^{10/x}

From equation2, y= x^{2y/5}

Set them equal:

x^{10/x}=x^{2y/5}

Since the bases are same and x>1, exponents must be equal:

10/x = 2y/5

Multiply both sides by 5x:

50=2xy

So, 2xy=50 => xy=25.

Wait, that's an important step. I think I can do this.

Wait, let me double-check.

From equation1: y= x^{10/x}

From equation2: y= x^{2y/5}

So, x^{10/x}=x^{2y/5}

Since the bases are same and x>1, exponents must be equal.

So,

10/x =2y/5

Multiply both sides by 5x:

50=2xy

Divide both sides by 2:

xy=25.

So, that's the product. So, xy=25.

Oh, that's much simpler. I overcomplicated it earlier.

I should have equated the exponents earlier.

So, the answer is 25.


Given the equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

we start by converting the logarithmic equations to exponential form. From the first equation:

\[
x^{10} = y^x
\]

From the second equation:

\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the first equation:

\[
10 \ln x = x \ln y \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln y = \frac{10 \ln x}{x}
\]

Similarly, taking the natural logarithm of the second equation:

\[
10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln y = \frac{4y \ln x}{10} = \frac{2y \ln x}{5}
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\ln y\):

\[
\frac{10 \ln x}{x} = \frac{2y \ln x}{5}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\ln x\) (since \(x > 1\), \(\ln x \neq 0\)):

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
50 = 2xy \quad \Rightarrow \quad xy = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
