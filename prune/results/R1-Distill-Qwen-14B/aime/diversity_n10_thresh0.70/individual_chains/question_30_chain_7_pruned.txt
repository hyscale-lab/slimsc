Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. The problem says:

Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \]
is divided by 1000.

Hmm, okay. So, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because ω ≠ 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and all the powers from ω^0 up to ω^12 are distinct roots. The product is from k=0 to 12, so that's all the roots. Interesting.

First, I need to compute this big product, and then find the remainder when it's divided by 1000. That probably means I have to find the product modulo 1000. But how?

Let me write down the expression again:

Product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm. Each term is a quadratic in ω^k, right? Let me see if I can factor or simplify each term.

Looking at the term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Let me denote x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x². Let's rearrange that: x² - 2x + 2.

Is that factorable? Let me see. The discriminant would be 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are (2 ± sqrt(-4))/2 = 1 ± i. So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

But since x is ω^k, which is a complex number on the unit circle, I'm not sure if that helps directly. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this quadratic in terms of ω^k and use some properties of roots of unity.

Wait, another thought: perhaps if I consider that ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity except 1, but wait, no, when k=0, ω^0 =1, so the product includes k=0 as well. So, actually, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1.

But ω ≠1, but for k=0, ω^0=1. So, does that mean that the product includes the term when k=0, which is x=1. Let me compute that.

When k=0: 2 - 2*1 + 1^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 =1. So, the first term is 1.

Hmm, so the entire product is 1 multiplied by the product over k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Wait, that's probably a useful simplification. So, the product is:

1 * Product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So, maybe I can focus on the product from k=1 to 12, since the k=0 term is 1.

Now, let's see. Each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me try to express this as a function in ω^k.

Let me write it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Wait, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2 = (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2.

Is there a way to relate this to polynomials evaluated at ω^k?

Wait, another approach: Since ω is a root of x
