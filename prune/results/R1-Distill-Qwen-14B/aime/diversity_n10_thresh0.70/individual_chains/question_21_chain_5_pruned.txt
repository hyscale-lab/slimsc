Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if when expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Also, the sum of these two digits should equal the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). 

My task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy the given conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me break this down. First, when a number n is written in base b with two digits, it can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a cannot be zero, and both a and c must be less than b (i.e., 0 ≤ a, c < b). Also, because n must be positive, a must be at least 1.

The other condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, and their sum is an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. Let me note that: n is a perfect square, say k^2, where k is a positive integer.

So, putting it together: n = a*b + c = k^2, and a + c = k.

Now, from the second equation, a + c = k, I can express c as c = k - a. Substituting this into the first equation gives:

n = a*b + (k - a) = a*b + k - a = a*(b - 1) + k.

But since n = k^2, we have:

k^2 = a*(b - 1) + k.

Let me rearrange this equation:

a*(b - 1) = k^2 - k.

So, a = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1).

But remember that a must be a positive integer less than b. Because a is a digit in base b, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1. Similarly, c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1. So, c must be non-negative, which gives k - a ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≤ k.

So, the constraints we have are:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ min(b - 1, k)
2. a must be an integer.
3. b must be such that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), so that a is an integer.
4. c = k - a must be ≥ 0 and < b.

Let me rephrase the equation: a = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1). Since a must be an integer, (b - 1) must divide (k^2 - k). So, (b - 1) is a divisor of k(k - 1).

So, for a given base b, we can consider all possible k where (b - 1) divides k(k - 1), and then check if the corresponding a is within the required range.

But since we are looking for b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need to find the smallest b such that the number of valid k's (and hence n's) is more than ten.

Let me think about how to approach this systematically.

First, for each base b, we can compute how many n's there are. So, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's such that:

1. k^2 is a two-digit number in base b. So, n = k^2 must satisfy b ≤ n < b^2. Wait, no. Wait, in base b, a two-digit number is from b^1 to b^2 - 1. So, n is in [b, b^2 - 1]. But since n = k^2, we have sqrt(b) ≤ k < sqrt(b^2 - 1). Since sqrt(b^2 - 1) is slightly less than b, so k must satisfy sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ b - 1.

Wait, more accurately, because n = k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be at least b (the smallest two-digit number is 10_b, which is b in decimal) and less than b^2 (since the largest two-digit number is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1). So, k^2 ∈ [b, b^2 - 1], which implies k ∈ [sqrt(b), sqrt(b^2 - 1)]. Since sqrt(b^2 - 1) is approximately b, we can say k ∈ [ceil(sqrt(b)), floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1))].

Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so the maximum k is b - 1.

Wait, let me compute for a specific b. For example, take b=13. Then n must be between 13 and 168 (since 13^2 is 169). So, k^2 must be between 13 and 168, so k is from 4 (sqrt(13)≈3.605) up to 12 (since 13^2 is 169, which is beyond 168). So, k=4,5,...,12.

But for each k, we have to check if (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1)=12. So, (k^2 -k) must be divisible by 12.

So,
