Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10 and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. And then I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll write down the given equations using logarithm properties. I remember that log_b(a^c) is equal to c * log_b(a). So applying that, the first equation becomes:

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, let's denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say a = log_x(y). Then, from the first equation, we have x * a = 10. So, a = 10 / x.

Wait a second, I also remember that log_x(y) is the reciprocal of log_y(x). Because log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). So, that means if a = log_x(y), then log_y(x) = 1/a.

Let me write that down. So, log_y(x) = 1/a. Now, looking back at the second equation, which involves log_y(x), it's 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Substituting 1/a into that, I get:

4y * (1/a) = 10.

But from earlier, a = 10 / x. So, substituting that in, it becomes:

4y * (x / 10) = 10.

Simplify that: (4y * x) / 10 = 10. Multiply both sides by 10: 4xy = 100. Then, divide both sides by 4: xy = 25.

Wait, so is that it? Did I just find that xy = 25? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting again, the first equation is x * log_x(y) = 10. Let a = log_x(y), so x * a = 10 → a = 10 / x.

Then, log_y(x) = 1/a = x / 10.

Second equation: 4y * log_y(x) = 10 → 4y * (x / 10) = 10 → (4xy)/10 = 10 → 4xy = 100 → xy = 25.

Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me verify if these values actually satisfy the original equations.

Suppose xy = 25. Let's see if I can find specific x and y that satisfy both equations.

From the first equation, log_x(y^x) = 10. Let's rewrite that:

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Let’s set log_x(y) = k, so x * k = 10.

From the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

But log_y(x) is 1/k, so 4y * (1/k) = 10.

We also know that xy = 25, so y = 25 / x.

Substituting y into the second equation: 4*(25/x)*(1/k) =10.

Simplify that: (100 / (xk)) =10 → 100 =10xk → xk =10.

Wait, from the first equation, xk =10. So that's consistent. So, both equations are satisfied as long as xk=10 and xy=25.

So, yes, it seems that the product xy is indeed 25.

But just to be thorough, let me try to solve for x and y.

If I let xk=10 and y=25/x.

Since k = log_x(y) = log_x(25/x).

Express that logarithm in terms of log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) - 1.

But log_x(25) is equal to log(25)/log(x), right?

Wait, maybe it's better to express k in terms of x.

k = log_x(y) = log_x(25/x) = log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) - 1.

But we also know that
