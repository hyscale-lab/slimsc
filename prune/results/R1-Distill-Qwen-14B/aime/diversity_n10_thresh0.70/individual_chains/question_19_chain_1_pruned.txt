Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the triangle has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers and related formulas. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be calculated using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, let me check that formula. I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. Yeah, that's right. So plugging in the values, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me compute that.

13 squared is 169, and 2*13*6 is 156. So OI² = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13). Okay, so the distance between O and I is sqrt(13).

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So IA is perpendicular to OI. That means that triangle OI A is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at A. Wait, no. Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at the intersection point. Wait, OI is a line segment from O to I. IA is another line from I to A. So where are these two lines meeting? They must meet at I, right? So IA is perpendicular to OI at point I. So that would make triangle IOA a right triangle with the right angle at I.

Wait, that can't be right. Because O is the circumcenter, and I is the incenter. So the line OI connects these two points, and IA is another line from I to vertex A. So if IA is perpendicular to OI, then at point I, the lines OI and IA meet at a right angle.

So triangle IOA is a right triangle with legs OI and IA, and hypotenuse OA. Wait, OA is the circumradius, right? So OA is 13. So in triangle IOA, OA is
