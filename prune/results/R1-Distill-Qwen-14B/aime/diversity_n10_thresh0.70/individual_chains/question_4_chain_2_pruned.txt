Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make it so that Bob can always win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the goal is to find all n where Bob can force a win. Since Bob is the second player, that means Alice is in a losing position when the game starts, right? So we're looking for n where the starting position is losing for Alice, hence a winning position for Bob.

I think the way to approach this is to model the game using the concept of Grundy numbers or by finding a pattern in the winning and losing positions. Let me try to find a pattern by calculating some small n and seeing who would win.

Let's start with n=1. Alice goes first and takes 1 token, wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take that 1 and win. Wait, but if Alice takes 1 from n=2, she leaves n=1 for Bob, who can take it and win. So that's bad for Alice. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 <4. So she has to take 1, which leads to Bob winning. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player.

Wait, let me make a table for small n and mark whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n | outcome
1 | W (Alice takes 1 and wins)
2 | L (Alice can't force a win)
Wait, let me think again. Wait, for n=2, Alice has to take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who can take that and win. So yes, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for Bob. So if Alice takes 1 from n=3, Bob is left with n=2, which is a losing position. So Bob can't win from there, meaning Alice can force a win from n=3. So n=3 is W.

Wait, no, wait. If Alice takes 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for Bob. So from n=2, Bob can't win. So Alice can force a win, so n=3 is W.

Now, n=4: Alice can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So n=4 is W.

n=5: Alice can take 1 token, leaving n=4, which is a winning position for Bob (since Bob can take 4 and win). Alternatively, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving n=1
