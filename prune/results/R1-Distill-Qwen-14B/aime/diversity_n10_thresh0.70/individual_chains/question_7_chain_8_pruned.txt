Okay, let's try to tackle this probability problem. So, we have a regular octagon, each vertex is colored either red or blue with a 50-50 chance. We need to find the probability that after some rotation, all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. Hmm, that's a mouthful.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We color each vertex red or blue, each with probability 1/2, independently. Then, we want the probability that there exists a rotation such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, for example, if we rotate the octagon by some number of steps, all the blue ones should align with the red ones. Got it.

Since the octagon is regular, it has rotational symmetry. The rotations are by multiples of 45 degrees, right? So, the possible rotations are 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., up to 315째, which corresponds to rotations by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps (since 360/45=8, so 8 positions). Each rotation is a shift by k positions, where k is from 0 to 7.

So, for each coloring, we need to check if there exists a rotation (i.e., a shift k) such that every blue vertex in the original coloring moves to a position that was originally red. Another way to think about it is: the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you rotate the octagon so that the blue set maps to the red set, then all blue vertices end up where red ones were.

Wait, no. Actually, the problem states that after rotation, the blue vertices must be where the red ones were. So, the image of the blue set under rotation must be the red set. So, the blue set must be a rotation of the red set. So, the set of blue vertices is a translate (rotation) of the red set. That makes sense.

So, another way to phrase it is: the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Which would imply that the number of blue and red vertices must be the same. Because if you rotate, the number of blue and red vertices should remain the same. So, the number of blue vertices is equal to the number of red vertices, which is 4 each. So
