Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we're given a set of rectangular boxes, denoted by 𝓑, each with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, we'll compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

First, let me think about the properties of a rectangular box. A rectangular box has length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, and z respectively. So, the surface area (SA) of such a box is given by the formula:

SA = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54

And the volume (V) is:

V = xyz = 23

We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box can be calculated using the formula:

d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)

So, the radius r of the sphere is half of this diagonal:

r = d / 2 = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²)) / 2

Therefore, r² is (x² + y² + z²) / 4. So, our goal is to minimize x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, the problem reduces to: minimize x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This looks like a constrained optimization problem. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a smarter way with inequalities.

Wait, I remember that for a given surface area and volume, the shape that minimizes the space diagonal (or maximizes the volume) is the cube. But wait, in our case, the volume is fixed, so maybe the cube isn't the optimal here. Wait, no, actually, in this problem, both surface area and volume are fixed, so the dimensions x, y, z must satisfy both constraints. So, the minimal space diagonal would correspond to the box that's as close to a cube as possible, given the surface area and volume constraints.

Alternatively, maybe we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

Let me think about how to express x² + y² + z² in terms of SA and V.

We know that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So, from here, we can write x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + zx). We know xy + yz + zx is 54/2 = 27. So:

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2*27 = (x + y + z)² - 54

So, if we can find (x + y + z), then we can compute x² + y² + z².

Alternatively, maybe we can use some inequalities here. Like, AM >= GM, but not sure yet.

Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations.

Let me define:

Let’s denote S = x + y + z

We know that xy + yz + zx = 27

And xyz = 23

So, the problem is to find S² - 54, which is x² + y² + z².

So, if we can find S, then we can get x² + y² + z².

But how?

Hmm, perhaps using the relationships between S, P = xy + yz + zx, and V = xyz. These are the elementary symmetric sums for three variables. So, if we treat x, y, z as roots of a cubic equation, the equation would be t³ - St² + Pt - V = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe we can use some inequality that relates S, P, and V.

Alternatively, perhaps we can apply AM ≥ GM.

We know that for positive real numbers,

(x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3)

So, S/3 ≥ (23)^(1/3)

So, S ≥ 3*(23)^(1/3)

But this is just a lower bound. But is this the minimal S? Not necessarily, because in our case, we have another constraint on the surface area. So, perhaps the minimal S occurs when x = y = z, but let's check.

If x = y = z, then it's a cube.

So, for a cube, surface area is 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x = 3.

Then volume would be x³ = 27. But in our problem, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube case is not applicable here.

So, the box is not a cube, but perhaps a rectangular prism with sides adjusted to meet the volume constraint.

So, maybe we can parameterize two variables in terms of the third.

Let me express variables in terms of, say, x.

Let’s assume x ≤ y ≤ z, just to assign some order.

From the volume equation: xyz = 23 → z = 23/(xy)

From the surface area equation: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 → xy + yz + zx = 27

Substituting z from above:

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27

Simplify:

xy + (23)/(x) + (23)/(y) = 27

Hmm, that looks a bit messy. Let me denote this as:

xy + 23(1/x + 1/y) = 27

Let me set u = 1/x and v = 1/y. Then, x = 1/u, y = 1/v.

So, substituting:

(1/u)(1/v) + 23(u + v) = 27

Which is:

1/(uv) + 23(u + v) = 27

Hmm, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe set t = x y.

Wait, let's consider that.

Let t = xy. Then, from the surface area equation:

t + 23/x + 23/y =27

But since t = xy, 23/x + 23/y = 23*(x + y)/(xy) = 23*(x + y)/t.

So, t + (23*(x + y))/t = 27

But x + y = S - z, and since z = 23/(xy) = 23/t.

So, x + y = S - (23/t)

But S is x + y + z = x + y + 23/t.

So, substituting back, x + y = S - 23/t

So, putting it into the previous equation:

t + (23*(S - 23/t )) / t = 27

Simplify:

t + [23*(S/t - 23/t²)] = 27

Multiply through:

t + (23 S)/t - (23²)/t² =27

So, t + (23 S)/t - (529)/t² =27

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers for constrained optimization. Let's try that.

We need to minimize f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z²

Subject to the constraints:

g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) -54 =0

h(x,y,z)=xyz -23=0

So, we can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + zx) -54) - μ(xyz -23)

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, and μ, set them equal to zero.

Compute partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

2(xy + yz + zx) =54

xyz=23

So, we have the system of equations:

1) 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ y z = 0

2) 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z = 0

3) 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ x y = 0

4) 2(xy + yz + zx) =54

5) xyz=23

This seems a bit involved, but perhaps we can find relationships between x, y, z.

Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2 to eliminate some variables.

Equation 1: 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ y z = 0

Equation 2: 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z = 0

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2x - 2y - 2λ(y + z - x - z) - μ y z + μ x z = 0

Simplify term by term:

2(x - y) - 2λ(y - x) + μ z(x - y) = 0

Factor out (x - y):

(x - y)(2 + 2λ + μ z) = 0

So, either x = y or 2 + 2λ + μ z =0.

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

Equation 3: 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ x y =0

Equation 2: 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z =0

Subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

2z - 2y - 2λ(x + y - x - z) - μ x y + μ x z =0

Simplify:

2(z - y) - 2λ(y - z) + μ x(z - y) =0

Factor out (z - y):

(z - y)(2 + 2λ + μ x) =0

So, either z = y or 2 + 2λ + μ x=0.

Similarly, subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

Equation 1: 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ y z =0

Equation 3: 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ x y =0

Subtract equation 3 from equation 1:

2x - 2z - 2λ(y + z - x - y) - μ y z + μ x y =0

Simplify:

2(x - z) - 2λ(z -x) + μ y (x - z) =0

Factor out (x - z):

(x - z)(2 + 2λ + μ y)=0

So, either x = z or 2 + 2λ + μ y=0.

Therefore, from the three subtractions, we have either two variables equal or some expressions with λ and μ.

So, possibilities:

Case 1: All variables are equal: x = y = z.

But earlier, we saw that for a cube, volume is 27, but our volume is 23, so this case is not possible.

Case 2: Two variables are equal, say x = y, but z different.

Let me assume x = y.

So, x = y.

Let me denote x = y = a, and z = b.

Then, the constraints become:

Surface area: 2(a² + ab + ab) = 54 → 2a² + 4ab =54 → a² + 2ab = 27.

Volume: a² b =23 → b=23/(a²)

Substitute into surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23/(a²)) =27

Simplify:

a² + (46/a) =27

Multiply both sides by a to eliminate denominator:

a³ +46 =27a

Bring all terms to left side:

a³ -27a +46=0

We need to solve this cubic equation. Let me try to find rational roots. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=2:

2³ -27*2 +46=8 -54 +46=0 → 0.

So, a=2 is a root.

So, factor the polynomial: (a -2)(a² +2a -23)=0.

Solving a² +2a -23=0 gives a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ±4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2sqrt(6).

Since a must be positive (as a dimension), a= -1 +2sqrt(6) ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible solutions: a=2 and a=-1 +2sqrt(6). Let's check both.

First, a=2:

Then, b=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, x=y=2, z=5.75.

Check surface area: 2(2² +2*5.75 +2*5.75)=2(4 +11.5 +11.5)=2(27)=54. Correct.

Volume:2*2*5.75=23. Correct.

So, this is a valid solution.

Second, a= -1 +2sqrt(6). Let me compute a numerically:

sqrt(6)≈2.449, so 2sqrt(6)=4.898. So, a≈-1 +4.898≈3.898.

Then, b=23/(a²). Compute a²≈ (3.898)^2≈15.193.

Then, b≈23/15.193≈1.514.

So, x=y≈3.898, z≈1.514.

Check surface area:

2(a² +ab +ab)=2(a² + 2ab)=2*(15.193 +2*(3.898*1.514)).

Compute 3.898*1.514≈5.904.

So, 2*(15.193 + 2*5.904)=2*(15.193 +11.808)=2*(26.901)=53.802≈54, which is correct.

Volume: a² b≈15.193*1.514≈23, which is correct.

So, both solutions are valid.

So, in case 2, we have two possible solutions where x=y, giving us two different boxes.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z² for both cases.

First, when a=2, b=5.75:

x² + y² + z²=2*(2²) + (5.75)^2=2*4 +33.0625=8 +33.0625=41.0625

Which is 41.0625. As a fraction, 41.0625=41 + 0.0625=41 + 1/16= (41*16 +1)/16= (656 +1)/16=657/16.

Second, when a≈3.898, b≈1.514:

x² + y² + z²=2*(a²) + b²≈2*(15.193) + (1.514)^2≈30.386 +2.292≈32.678.

Wait, but let me compute this exactly without approximating.

We have a = -1 + 2√6.

So, a² = (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6.

Similarly, b=23/(a²)=23/(25 -4√6). To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

b=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, b= (25 +4√6)/23.

Now, compute x² + y² + z²=2*a² + b².

We have a²=25 -4√6, so 2a²=50 -8√6.

b²= [ (25 +4√6)/23 ]².

Compute numerator: (25 +4√6)^2=625 + 200√6 + 96=721 +200√6.

So, b²=(721 +200√6)/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert 50 -8√6 to over 529:

(50*529 -8√6*529)/529.

Compute 50*529: 50*500=25000, 50*29=1450, total=25000+1450=26450.

8*529=4232, so:

(26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6)/529

Combine like terms:

26450 +721 =27171

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4032√6)

So, numerator is 27171 -4032√6.

Thus, x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032√6)/529.

Wait, but let's compute that.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 2*a² + b² = 2*(25 -4√6) + [ (25 +4√6)^2 ]/(23)^2.

Compute 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

Compute (25 +4√6)^2=25² + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2=625 +200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, b²=(721 +200√6)/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

To add these, express 50 -8√6 as fractions over 529.

50=50*(529/529)=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6= -8√6*(529/529)= (-4232√6)/529.

So, adding:

26450/529 -4232√6/529 +721/529 +200√6/529.

Combine numerators:

(26450 +721) + (-4232√6 +200√6) =27171 -4032√6.

So, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute this numerically to see which case gives a smaller x² + y² + z².

First case: 657/16=41.0625.

Second case: (27171 -4032√6)/529. Let's compute numerator:

Compute 4032√6: sqrt(6)=2.449, so 4032*2.449≈4032*2=8064; 4032*0.449≈4032*0.4=1612.8, 4032*0.049≈197.568; total≈1612.8+197.568≈1810.368. So, 4032√6≈8064 +1810.368≈9874.368.

So, 27171 -9874.368≈27171 -9874=17297, minus 0.368≈17296.632.

So, numerator≈17296.632.

Divide by 529: 17296.632 /529≈32.678.

So, x² + y² + z²≈32.678 in the second case, which is much less than 41.0625 in the first case.

So, the minimal x² + y² + z² is approximately 32.678, which comes from the second case where a≈3.898, b≈1.514.

But wait, is this the minimal? Could there be a case where all variables are distinct, leading to an even smaller x² + y² + z²?

Well, in the case where two variables are equal, we found a lower value than when all variables are different but not equal. But perhaps the minimal occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible, but in this case, with volume less than the cube's volume, it's stretched more in two dimensions and compressed in the third.

But perhaps we can confirm that this is indeed the minimal.

Alternatively, since in case 2, when x = y, we found a lower value, and perhaps symmetry suggests that the minimal occurs when two variables are equal.

Wait, but let's consider if x ≠ y ≠ z, whether x² + y² + z² can be smaller.

But solving the Lagrangian equations without assuming x=y seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the problem in terms of variables u = x + y + z, v = xy + yz + zx =27, w=xyz=23.

We know from algebra that:

x² + y² + z² = u² - 2v = u² -54.

So, we need to find the minimal value of u² -54.

Thus, minimizing x² + y² + z² is equivalent to minimizing u², given that v=27 and w=23.

So, perhaps, given v and w, find the minimal possible u².

Is there a relation between u, v, w?

We have the identity that for any real numbers,

u^3 - 4u v + 4v w = (x + y)(y + z)(z +x)

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the inequality that relates u, v, w.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation from cubic equations.

We can consider that x, y, z are roots of the cubic equation t³ - u t² + v t - w =0.

So, t³ -u t² +27 t -23=0.

For real roots, the cubic must have three real roots, so the discriminant must be non-negative.

The discriminant D of a cubic equation t³ + a t² + b t + c=0 is D=18 a b c -4 a³ c + a² b² -4 b³ -27 c².

Wait, but in our case, the equation is t³ -u t² +27 t -23=0, so a= -u, b=27, c= -23.

So, compute D:

D = 18*(-u)*27*(-23) -4*(-u)^3*(-23) + (-u)^2*(27)^2 -4*(27)^3 -27*(-23)^2.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can set D >=0.

But this might not directly help. Maybe it's better to consider that the minimal u occurs when two variables are equal, which is the case we already solved.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality on u.

But u =x + y + z.

We have that xyz=23.

By AM ≥ GM,

(x + y + z)/3 >= (xyz)^(1/3) =23^(1/3).

So, u >= 3*(23)^(1/3).

Compute 23^(1/3): cube of 2 is 8, cube of 3 is 27, so 23^(1/3)≈2.843.

So, u >= 3*2.843≈8.529.

But in our case, when x=y=2, z=5.75, u=2+2+5.75=9.75.

Which is higher than 8.529.

In the other case, where x=y≈3.898, z≈1.514, u≈3.898 +3.898 +1.514≈9.309.

Still higher than 8.529.

Wait, but is the minimal u achieved when x=y=z? No, because xyz=23 is less than the cube case, which would have xyz=27.

So, perhaps the minimal u is achieved when two variables are as large as possible, and the third as small as possible, subject to the constraints.

Wait, but we can't have variables being too large or too small because the surface area is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps to minimize u, given v=27, w=23.

Wait, perhaps using the inequality that for positive real numbers,

u >= sqrt(3v + 3*sqrt(3v*w)) ?

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the inequality between symmetric sums.

Wait, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the following approach.

We have x, y, z positive reals with xy + yz + zx=27 and xyz=23.

We want to find the minimal u=x+y+z.

This is a constrained optimization problem.

We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the function to minimize: f(x,y,z)=x+y+z.

Subject to constraints:

g(x,y,z)=xy + yz + zx=27

h(x,y,z)=xyz=23

So, Lagrangian:

L =x + y + z - λ(xy + yz + zx -27) - μ(xyz -23)

Take partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x=1 - λ(y + z) - μ yz=0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y=1 - λ(x + z) - μ xz=0

∂L/∂z=1 - λ(x + y) - μ xy=0

Set these equal to zero.

So,

1) 1 = λ(y + z) + μ yz

2) 1 = λ(x + z) + μ xz

3) 1 = λ(x + y) + μ xy

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

0 = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(xz - yz)

Simplify:

0=λ(x - y) + μ z(x - y)

Factor:

(x - y)(λ + μ z)=0

So, either x=y or λ + μ z=0.

Similarly, subtract equation 2 - equation3:

0=λ(x + z -x - y) + μ(xz - xy)

Simplify:

0=λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y)

Factor:

(z - y)(λ + μ x)=0

So, z=y or λ + μ x=0.

Similarly, subtract equation 1 - equation3:

0=λ(y + z -x - y) + μ yz - μ xy

Simplify:

0=λ(z -x) + μ y(z -x)

Factor:

(z -x)(λ + μ y)=0

So, z=x or λ + μ y=0.

So, possibilities:

Either all variables are equal (x=y=z), which we saw isn't possible here since volume would be 27, but it's 23.

Or, some pairs are equal, leading us back to the case where two variables are equal.

So, when x = y, then from the first case, we can find the solution as above.

Thus, the minimal u occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different.

Thus, the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs in the case where two variables are equal, giving us x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529≈32.678.

Wait, but in the first case when x=y=2, z=5.75, x² + y² + z²=41.0625, which is larger than 32.678. So, the case where x=y≈3.898, z≈1.514 gives a smaller x² + y² + z².

Thus, the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -4032√6)/529. Therefore, r²= (x² + y² + z²)/4= [ (27171 -4032√6)/529 ] /4= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, but let me compute this fraction.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the case where x=y, we found x=2, z=23/(2^2)=23/4=5.75.

So, x² + y² + z²=2*(4) + (23/4)^2=8 + (529/16)= (128 +529)/16=657/16≈41.0625.

In the other case, where a= -1 +2√6≈3.898, and b=(25 +4√6)/23≈1.514, then x² + y² + z²=2*a² +b².

We have a²=25 -4√6, so 2*a²=50 -8√6.

b²=(25 +4√6)^2 /23²= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

To add these, express 50 -8√6 as (50*529 -8√6*529)/529.

So, 50*529=26450, 8*529=4232.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= [26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6]/529= [26450 +721 - (4232√6 -200√6)]/529= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

So, that's correct.

Then, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this seems messy. Let me check if 27171 and 4032 have a common factor with 2116.

Wait, 2116=46²= (2*23)^2=4*529.

So, 2116=4*529.

Now, let's see if numerator can be simplified.

Let me factor numerator:

27171 -4032√6.

But 27171 and 4032 may have common factors.

Compute GCD(27171,4032).

Compute 4032 divides into 27171 how many times.

4032*6=24192, 27171-24192=2979.

Now, find GCD(4032,2979).

4032 ÷2979=1 with remainder 1053.

Now, GCD(2979,1053).

2979 ÷1053=2 with remainder 873.

GCD(1053,873).

1053 ÷873=1 with remainder 180.

GCD(873,180).

873 ÷180=4 with remainder 153.

GCD(180,153).

180 ÷153=1 with remainder 27.

GCD(153,27).

153 ÷27=5 with remainder 18.

GCD(27,18).

27 ÷18=1 with remainder 9.

GCD(18,9)=9.

So, GCD is 9.

So, 27171=9*3019.

4032=9*448.

Thus, numerator=9*(3019 -448√6).

Denominator=2116=4*529=4*23².

So, r²=9*(3019 -448√6)/(4*529).

Simplify 9/4= (9/4).

But 3019 and 529: 529 is 23². Does 23 divide 3019?

3019 ÷23: 23*131=3013, 3019-3013=6. So, no.

So, the fraction is 9*(3019 -448√6)/(4*529).

But is there a way to write this as a fraction without the square root?

Wait, but since we have a square root in the numerator, it's not straightforward to write r² as a simple fraction unless the terms with √6 cancel out, which doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in assuming that the minimal occurs when two variables are equal. Because when we set x=y, we found a solution, but perhaps the minimal occurs when all variables are different, leading to a smaller x² + y² + z².

Wait, but according to the Lagrangian approach, the minimal should occur when either two variables are equal or when all are equal. Since all equal isn't possible here, the minimal must occur when two variables are equal.

Thus, the minimal x² + y² + z² is indeed (27171 -4032√6)/529, and r² is this divided by 4.

So, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this seems messy. Let me compute it numerically.

Compute numerator:

27171≈27171

4032√6≈4032*2.449≈4032*2=8064, 4032*0.449≈1810. So, total≈8064+1810=9874.

So, numerator≈27171 -9874≈17297.

Denominator=2116.

So, r²≈17297/2116≈8.18.

Wait, but earlier, when x=y=2, r²=41.0625/4≈10.266.

And in the other case, r²≈32.678/4≈8.1695.

So, the minimal r² is approximately 8.1695.

But the exact value is (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, but let me see if this can be simplified.

Wait, 27171 and 4032 are both divisible by 9, as we saw earlier.

So, factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 9*(3019 -448√6)

Denominator: 4*23²=4*529=2116.

So, r²= [9*(3019 -448√6)] /2116.

But 9 and 2116: 2116=4*529=4*23². 9 and 23 are coprime, so we can't reduce further.

Thus, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But wait, this can't be simplified further, so p=27171 -4032√6, q=2116. But wait, p and q have to be integers, but in this case, p has a radical, which isn't allowed. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe instead of assuming x=y, I should consider that the minimal sphere occurs when all dimensions are such that the space diagonal is minimized, subject to the given constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps consider using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or another inequality to bound x² + y² + z².

Wait, another approach: given that surface area is fixed, perhaps the minimal space diagonal occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible.

But in our case, the volume is less than the cube volume (23 vs 27), so perhaps the box is more elongated.

Wait, but perhaps we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and volume.

We have:

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = S² - 54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², we need to minimize S².

So, find the minimal S such that S^3 >= 27*23^(1/3) via AM-GM, but that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps use the inequality between arithmetic mean and geometric mean.

Wait, but I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the minimal S occurs when two variables are equal, as in the case above, leading to S≈9.309, which gives x² + y² + z²≈32.678, so r²≈8.169.

But I need an exact value.

Wait, let's compute the exact value.

We have x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

So, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this fraction has a radical in the numerator, which complicates things. The problem states that r² can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers. So, I must have made a mistake in my earlier approach, because this can't be expressed as a simple fraction with integers unless the radical terms cancel out, which they don't here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when the box is a cube, but that's not possible because the volume is 23, not 27. So, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but we need to ensure that the resulting fraction is indeed a rational number.

Wait, but in the case where two variables are equal, we obtained x² + y² + z²=657/16 when x=y=2, which gives r²=657/(16*4)=657/64. But 657 and 64 are coprime? Let's check.

657 ÷3=219, 64 is 2^6, so no common factors. So, 657/64 is in simplest terms.

But earlier, we saw that when x=y=2, r²≈10.266, which is higher than the other case.

But the problem states that r is the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each box in 𝓑. So, perhaps the minimal r² is achieved in the case where x=y=2, z=5.75, because that's a valid box, and perhaps the other case gives a smaller r², but is that box valid?

Wait, but the box with x=y≈3.898, z≈1.514 also satisfies the surface area and volume constraints, so it's also in set 𝓑. Thus, the minimal r² would be the smallest among all possible boxes in 𝓑, which would be the case where x² + y² + z² is minimized, which is the case when x=y≈3.898, z≈1.514.

But then r² would be (27171 -4032√6)/2116, which is irrational, but the problem states that r² can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers. So, this suggests that my earlier approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the minimal occurs when two variables are equal. Maybe the minimal occurs when all variables are different, but in such a way that x² + y² + z² is a rational number.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps consider that for the minimal sphere, the box must be such that all its vertices lie on the sphere. The sphere's center would be the center of the box, i.e., at (x/2, y/2, z/2).

The space diagonal would be the distance from the center to any vertex, which is sqrt( (x/2)^2 + (y/2)^2 + (z/2)^2 ). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the space diagonal of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), and the radius is half of that, so r= sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2.

Thus, r²=(x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, to find the minimal r², we need to minimize x² + y² + z², given the constraints.

But earlier, I tried to minimize x² + y² + z² under the constraints of fixed surface area and volume, and found that when two variables are equal, we get a lower x² + y² + z² than when all variables are equal.

But according to the problem statement, r² must be a rational number, so perhaps the minimal occurs when x² + y² + z² is a multiple of 4, leading to r² being rational.

Wait, but in the case where x=y=2, z=5.75, x² + y² + z²=657/16, so r²=657/64, which is rational.

In the other case, x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032√6)/529, which is irrational, so r² would also be irrational, which contradicts the problem statement.

Thus, perhaps the minimal occurs when x=y=2, z=5.75, leading to r²=657/64.

But wait, the problem states that r is the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each box in 𝓑. So, perhaps this implies that the minimal sphere must contain all boxes in 𝓑, meaning that the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the maximal space diagonal among all boxes in 𝓑.

Wait, that's a different interpretation. Wait, no, the problem says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of 𝓑". So, the sphere must contain every box in 𝓑. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain any box from 𝓑.

Thus, the radius r must be at least the maximal space diagonal among all boxes in 𝓑. So, we need to find the maximal space diagonal across all boxes in 𝓑, then r is half of that.

Wait, that changes things.

So, earlier, I thought we needed to find the minimal space diagonal, but actually, it's the other way around. We need the sphere that can contain any box in 𝓑, so r must be at least the maximal space diagonal of any box in 𝓑. Thus, we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal (i.e., x² + y² + z²) among all boxes in 𝓑, then r is half of that.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, we need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z², given the surface area and volume constraints, then r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, in that case, the box with x=y=2, z=5.75 gives x² + y² + z²=657/16, which is 41.0625.

But in the other case, where x=y≈3.898, z≈1.514, x² + y² + z²≈32.678, which is smaller.

So, the maximum would occur when x² + y² + z² is as large as possible. But how large can x² + y² + z² be given the constraints?

Wait, perhaps when one dimension is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible.

But with fixed surface area and volume, how does x² + y² + z² behave?

Let me consider when one variable approaches zero, but given that xyz=23, variables can't be zero.

Wait, let me think: if x approaches zero, then y and z must approach infinity to maintain the volume, but surface area would also blow up, which isn't allowed here.

Wait, but in our constraints, surface area is fixed at 54, and volume at 23.

So, perhaps x² + y² + z² is bounded above.

Wait, let me consider the case where one variable is as large as possible.

Let’s assume z is maximum, then x and y would be as small as possible.

But given that xyz=23, x and y can't be too small.

Let me consider the case where x approaches its minimal possible value.

Wait, perhaps the maximum of x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are as small as possible, and the third is as large as possible.

But let me try to find extreme cases.

Case 1: x approaches minimal, y approaches minimal, z approaches maximal.

But how to define minimal?

Alternatively, perhaps consider the case where two variables are equal and minimal, leading to the third variable being maximal.

Wait, but perhaps without loss of generality, we can set x ≤ y ≤ z.

To find the maximum of x² + y² + z², perhaps when x is as small as possible, y is as small as possible, and z is as large as possible, subject to the constraints.

But how?

Let me try to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + zx)=54 and xyz=23.

Let me consider using Lagrange multipliers again, but this time looking for the maximum.

Wait, but optimization problems with fixed constraints can have maxima and minima, so perhaps the maximum occurs at the endpoints.

Wait, perhaps when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible.

But in our earlier case, when x=y=2, z=5.75, we get x² + y² + z²=657/16≈41.0625.

Is this the maximum?

Let me see if it's possible to get a larger x² + y² + z².

Suppose I set x=1, then y and z must satisfy:

From volume: yz=23/1=23.

From surface area: 2(1*y + y*z + z*1)=54 → 2(y + yz + z)=54 → y + yz + z=27.

But yz=23, so y +23 + z=27 → y + z=4.

So, y + z=4, yz=23.

But solving y + z=4 and yz=23.

The quadratic equation would be t² -4t +23=0.

Discriminant=16-92= -76 <0, which implies no real solutions. So, x cannot be 1.

Similarly, trying x=1.5.

Then, yz=23/1.5≈15.333.

Surface area equation: 2(1.5y + y z +1.5 z)=54 → 1.5y + y z +1.5 z=27.

But y z=15.333, so 1.5y +15.333 +1.5 z=27 →1.5(y + z)=11.667 → y + z≈7.778.

So, y + z≈7.778, y z≈15.333.

Then, the quadratic equation is t² -7.778 t +15.333=0.

Discriminant=7.778² -4*15.333≈60.5 -61.333≈-0.833 <0. No real solutions.

So, x can't be 1.5.

Trying x=3.

Then, yz=23/3≈7.6667.

Surface area equation: 2(3y + y z +3 z)=54 →3y + y z +3 z=27.

But y z=7.6667, so 3(y + z) +7.6667=27 →3(y + z)=19.3333 → y + z≈6.4444.

So, y + z≈6.4444, y z≈7.6667.

Quadratic equation: t² -6.4444 t +7.6667=0.

Discriminant=6.4444² -4*7.6667≈41.53 -30.667≈10.863>0.

So, real roots exist.

Compute t=(6.4444 ±sqrt(10.863))/2≈(6.4444 ±3.296)/2.

So, t≈(6.4444 +3.296)/2≈9.7404/2≈4.8702

Or t≈(6.4444 -3.296)/2≈3.1484/2≈1.5742.

Thus, y≈4.8702, z≈1.5742 or vice versa.

So, x=3, y≈4.8702, z≈1.5742.

Compute x² + y² + z²≈9 +23.722 +2.477≈35.199.

Which is less than 41.0625.

So, x=3 gives x² + y² + z²≈35.199.

Thus, not larger than the case when x=y=2.

Trying x=4.

Then, yz=23/4=5.75.

Surface area equation: 2(4y + y z +4 z)=54 →4y + y z +4 z=27.

But y z=5.75, so 4(y + z) +5.75=27 →4(y + z)=21.25 → y + z=5.3125.

So, y + z=5.3125, y z=5.75.

Quadratic equation: t² -5.3125 t +5.75=0.

Discriminant=5.3125² -4*5.75≈28.207 -23=5.207>0.

Solutions: t=(5.3125 ±sqrt(5.207))/2≈(5.3125 ±2.282)/2.

So, t≈(5.3125+2.282)/2≈7.5945/2≈3.7973

Or t≈(5.3125-2.282)/2≈3.0305/2≈1.5153.

Thus, y≈3.7973, z≈1.5153.

Compute x² + y² + z²≈16 +14.416 +2.296≈32.712.

Which is less than 41.0625.

So, x=4 gives x² + y² + z²≈32.712.

Thus, the case when x=y=2, z=5.75 gives the highest x² + y² + z² so far.

Let me try x=2.5.

Then, yz=23/2.5=9.2.

Surface area equation: 2(2.5 y + y z +2.5 z)=54 →2.5 y + y z +2.5 z=27.

But y z=9.2, so 2.5(y + z) +9.2=27 →2.5(y + z)=17.8 → y + z=7.12.

Thus, y + z=7.12, y z=9.2.

Quadratic equation: t² -7.12 t +9.2=0.

Discriminant=7.12² -4*9.2≈50.694 -36.8≈13.894>0.

Solutions: t=(7.12 ±sqrt(13.894))/2≈(7.12 ±3.727)/2.

So, t≈(7.12+3.727)/2≈10.847/2≈5.4235

Or t≈(7.12-3.727)/2≈3.393/2≈1.6965.

Thus, y≈5.4235, z≈1.6965.

Compute x² + y² + z²≈6.25 +29.416 +2.879≈38.545.

Which is less than 41.0625.

So, still, the case when x=y=2, z=5.75 gives the highest x² + y² + z².

Let me try x=1. Let's see, earlier when x=1, no solution exists.

x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

Let me see if there's a case where x² + y² + z² is larger than 41.0625.

Wait, let me think: when x approaches 0, but we saw that for x=1, it's impossible. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are as small as possible, and the third as large as possible.

But in our earlier case, when x=y=2, z=5.75, that's a valid solution.

Is there a way to make z even larger while keeping x and y at 2?

Wait, if x=y=2, then z=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75. So, z can't be larger than that without violating the volume constraint.

Thus, in this case, when x and y are minimal (x=y=2), z is maximized, leading to the maximal x² + y² + z².

Thus, the maximal x² + y² + z² is 657/16, leading to r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

657 and 64 are coprime since 657 ÷3=219, and 64 is 2^6, no common factors.

Thus, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but earlier, when I assumed that the minimal r² was needed, I got 32.678, but that was incorrect because the problem requires the sphere to contain any box in 𝓑, so the radius must be at least the maximal space diagonal among all boxes in 𝓑.

Thus, the correct approach is to find the maximal x² + y² + z², which occurs when x=y=2, z=5.75, giving x² + y² + z²=657/16, so r²=657/64.

Thus, the answer is 657 + 64=721.


To solve the problem, we analyze the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. The goal is to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, then compute \( r^2 \) as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, and find \( p + q \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Define Variables**: Let the dimensions of the box be \( x, y, z \). The surface area is \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \) and the volume is \( xyz = 23 \).

2. **Space Diagonal**: The space diagonal \( d \) of the box is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \). The radius \( r \) of the sphere is \( \frac{d}{2} \), so \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} \).

3. **Optimization**: We need to maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) under the given constraints to find the largest possible space diagonal, ensuring the sphere can contain any box in the set.

4. **Case Analysis**: By analyzing different cases, we find that the maximum \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) occurs when \( x = y = 2 \) and \( z = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \). This gives:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 5.75^2 = 4 + 4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = \frac{657}{16}
   \]

5. **Compute \( r^2 \)**:
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} = \frac{657}{16 \times 4} = \frac{657}{64}
   \]

6. **Simplify**: The fraction \( \frac{657}{64} \) is in simplest terms since 657 and 64 share no common factors other than 1.

7. **Final Answer**: \( p = 657 \), \( q = 64 \), so \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{721}
