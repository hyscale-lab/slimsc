Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me parse through it step by step. The equation given is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, which is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin. The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the infimum of BD², the square of the length of diagonal BD across all possible such rhombi.

Hmm, okay. First, let me recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, not necessarily right angles. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, hold on—that's actually a property of a kite. No, in a rhombus, which is a special case of a kite where all sides are equal, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, so in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, so the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis. Therefore, the points A, B, C, D are arranged such that if A is (p, q), then C would be (-p, -q), and similarly, B and D would be symmetric in some way. Wait, but since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, points A and C are opposite vertices, and points B and D are the other pair of opposite vertices.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily of the same length, but they do bisect each other. So, if the origin is their intersection point, each diagonal is split into two equal parts. So, if point A is (p, q), then point C is (-p, -q). Similarly, points B and D will be symmetric with respect to the origin as well.

But in this case, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyper
