Okay, so I need to solve this problem about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the definition: a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful. Let me see why. When 81 is written in base 13, it's '63'_13, since 6*13 + 3 = 81. The sum of the digits is 6 + 3 = 9, and indeed, sqrt(81) is 9. So that makes sense.

So, my goal is to find the smallest base b (starting from 2 upwards) such that there are more than ten numbers n that are b-eautiful.

Let me break down what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form a* b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since the first digit can't be zero in a two-digit number), and c can range from 0 to b-1. 

So, for each base b, the two-digit numbers in base b are n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1, and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c. Since sqrt(n) must be an integer (because a and c are integers and their sum is an integer), n must be a perfect square. Wait, but the problem doesn’t explicitly say that n must be a perfect square, but sqrt(n) is an integer because it's equal to a + c, which is an integer. So, n must be a perfect square. Hmm, that's an important point.

So, n is a perfect square, and n is a two-digit number in base b. Let me denote m = sqrt(n), so n = m². Then, according to the problem, m = a + c. Also, n = a*b + c. So, combining these, we have:

m² = a*b + c.

But since m = a + c, we can write c = m - a. Substituting back into the equation:

m² = a*b + (m - a).

Simplify that:

m² = a*b + m - a.

Let me rearrange:

m² - m = a*b - a.

Factor the right side:

m² - m = a*(b - 1).

So, m² - m must be divisible by a, where a is between 1 and b-1.

Hmm. So, for each base b, we can consider all possible m such that m is the sum of digits a and c, and n = m² is a two-digit number in base b. Additionally, a must be a positive integer less than b, and c must be a non-negative integer less than b.

Let me try to express a in terms of m and b. From the equation m² - m = a*(b - 1), we can solve for a:

a = (m² - m)/(b - 1).

Since a must be an integer, (m² - m) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since a must be between 1 and b-1, inclusive, we have:

1 ≤ (m² - m)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1.

Let me write these inequalities:

1 ≤ (m² - m)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1.

Which can be rewritten as:

b - 1 ≤ m² - m ≤ (b - 1)*(b - 1).

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The inequality is:

1 ≤ (m² - m)/(b - 1) ≤ (b - 1).

So, multiplying all parts by (b - 1), which is positive because b ≥ 2, so (b -1) ≥ 1. So:

(b - 1) ≤ m² - m ≤ (b - 1)^2.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check. No, wait.

Wait, the middle term after multiplying is m² - m. The left inequality is:

1 * (b - 1) ≤ m² - m => (b - 1) ≤ m² - m.

The right inequality is:

(m² - m)/(b - 1) ≤ (b - 1) => m² - m ≤ (b -1)^2.

So, combining these, we get:

(b - 1) ≤ m² - m ≤ (b -1)^2.

And that's for each m, given b.

But wait, I think I might be overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible range of m.

Since n is a two-digit number in base b, the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b,
