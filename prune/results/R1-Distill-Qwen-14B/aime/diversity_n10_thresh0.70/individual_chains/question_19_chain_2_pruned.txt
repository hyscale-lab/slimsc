Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I'll just jot down my thoughts as I go through it. Maybe it'll help me organize my ideas better.

The problem says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall some properties about triangle centers. The circumradius (R) is given as 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. The inradius (r) is 6, the radius of the inscribed circle.

We also know that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. That seems important. Maybe there's a relationship or formula that connects these perpendicularity conditions with other elements of the triangle.

Let me think about the formulae related to inradius and circumradius. I know that the inradius r can be expressed in terms of the area (Δ) and the semiperimeter (s): r = Δ / s. And the area can also be expressed using the circumradius as Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Maybe I need to use some coordinate geometry or vector methods. Alternatively, maybe there's a theorem or lemma related to the incenter and circumradius in specific cases.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I remember that the distance OI can be calculated using the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me verify that.

Yes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, in this case, OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13).

So OI is sqrt(13) units long.

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. Maybe I can model this using coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system where point I is at the origin (0,0), and O lies somewhere on the x-axis because IA is perpendicular to OI. Wait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), then the line OI can be along the x-axis, and IA would be along the y-axis. That could simplify things.

So, let's position point I at (0,0). Let me assume that O lies on the positive x-axis at (d, 0), where d is the distance OI. We found that d is sqrt(13). So, O is at (sqrt(13), 0).

Point A is somewhere in the plane, and IA is perpendicular to OI. Since OI is along the x-axis, IA must be along the y-axis. So point A lies somewhere along the y-axis. Let's say A is at (0, a), where a is the length from I to A.

Wait, but in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, not the distance from the incenter to the vertex. Hmm, so IA isn't the inradius. IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I think that's called the length of the internal angle bisector from A, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. Let me think about that.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be given by the formula:

IA = r / sin(A/2)

Where r is the inradius, and A is the angle at vertex A.

But wait, is that correct? Let me double
