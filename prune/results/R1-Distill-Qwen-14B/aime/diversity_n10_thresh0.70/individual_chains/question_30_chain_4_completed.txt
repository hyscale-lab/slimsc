Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1, where n is the order. Since ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1, it's one of the primitive roots. So, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Wait, actually, Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) where k runs through the integers relatively prime to n. For prime n like 13, Φ₁₃(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here. Let's look at the product given: ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, that's a product over all 13th roots of unity (including 1, since k=0 gives ω^0=1). So maybe I can think of this as evaluating some polynomial at specific points.

Wait, another approach: maybe it's better to consider each term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) and see if it can be rewritten in a way that relates to the minimal polynomial or cyclotomic polynomial.

Let me compute 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me factor out 2: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor it differently. Let's see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me write it as (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. So it's a quadratic in ω^k.

Wait, let me think: for each k, ω^{2k} is just (ω^k)^2. So if I let x = ω^k, then each term is x² - 2x + 2. So the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k.

But wait, since ω^k are all distinct 13th roots of unity, except ω^0=1, but wait no, k runs from 0 to 12, so ω^k runs through all 13th roots of unity. So the product is the product of (x² - 2x + 2) as x runs through all 13th roots of unity.

But I know that if I have a polynomial P(x) and I take the product of P(ω^k) for all k from 0 to 12, that's equal to the resultant of P(x) and Φ₁₃(x), or something like that. Alternatively, since Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial, the product over all roots (including 1) would relate to evaluating P(x) at x=1 and something else.

Wait, another way: consider that for any polynomial f(x), the product over all roots ω^k of f(ω^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and Φ₁₃(x). Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the product is equal to the value of f(x) evaluated at each ω^k and multiplied together.

Wait, perhaps I can use the identity that the product over k of (x - ω^k) = Φ₁₃(x). But in this case, it's a product of (quadratic terms) evaluated at each ω^k. So perhaps I can relate this product to Φ₁₃(x) in some way.

Wait, let me think about the product P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at x=ω^k. Wait, no, each term is (x² - 2x + 2) where x is ω^k. So P is the product over all ω^k of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). So maybe I can write this as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). 

Alternatively, since Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial, any symmetric function over ω^k can be expressed in terms of Φ₁₃. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the product as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 + ω^{2k} - 2ω^k). Let me denote z = ω^k. Then each term is 2 + z² - 2z. So the product becomes ∏_{z^13=1} (2 + z² - 2z).

Hmm, so I need to compute the product of (2 + z² - 2z) for each 13th root of unity z.

Alternatively, note that 2 + z² - 2z = z² - 2z + 2. Let me denote this as f(z) = z² - 2z + 2.

So P = ∏_{z^13=1} f(z). I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots of unity of f(x) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1, but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, the product over all nth roots of unity of f(z) is equal to the product of f(z) as z ranges over the roots, which can sometimes be expressed as the constant term or leading coefficient times something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe consider that the product over all z^13=1 of (z² - 2z + 2) is equal to the resultant of the polynomials z² - 2z + 2 and z^13 - 1. The resultant can be computed as the product of f evaluated at the roots of g, which is exactly what we have here. The resultant of f(z) and g(z)=z^13 -1 is equal to the product of f(z) for all roots z of g(z). So yes, that would be our P.

But how do I compute the resultant of f(z) and g(z)? The resultant can be computed via the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the resultant of f(z) and g(z) is equal to the product of f(ζ) for all roots ζ of g(z). Which is exactly our case, so P is the resultant.

But maybe there's another way to compute this. Let me think about the properties of f(z) and g(z). Since f(z) is a quadratic, and g(z) is z^13 - 1, which factors as (z - 1)Φ₁₃(z).

Alternatively, since we're dealing with the product over all roots of g(z), which are the 13th roots of unity, maybe I can write f(z) as (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are the roots of f(z). Then the product over all z^13=1 of (z - a)(z - b) is equal to the product over z of (z - a)(z - b) = product_{z} (z - a) * product_{z} (z - b).

But product_{z} (z - a) for all 13th roots of unity z is equal to Φ₁₃(a), since Φ₁₃(z) = product_{z^13=1, z≠1} (z - 1). Wait, no, Φ_n(z) is the product over primitive nth roots of unity, not all. So perhaps that's a different approach.

Wait, let's compute product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = z^13 - a^13, because product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = (z^{13} - a^{13})/(z - a) evaluated at z=1? Wait, no, wait: the product of (z - a) for all 13th roots of unity is the same as the value of the polynomial z^13 - 1 when z is replaced by a, but divided by something.

Wait, more accurately, for any polynomial f(z), product_{z^13=1} f(z) = product_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = resultant(f(z), z^13 - 1). But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, another way: Let me consider that product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1) if a ≠ 1, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, actually, no: product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = z^13 - a^13 evaluated at z=1? No, maybe not. Wait, no, product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = (z^{13} - a^{13})/(z - a) when z ≠ a. Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as evaluating the polynomial z^13 - 1 at z = a, but it's not quite that.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = Φ₁₃(a) multiplied by (a - 1) if a is not a 13th root of unity. Because the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(z) is the product over primitive 13th roots, which are the roots of z^13 - 1 excluding z=1. So, product_{z^13=1, z≠1} (z - a) = Φ₁₃(a). Therefore, product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = (a - 1)Φ₁₃(a). 

Wait, let me test this with a simple case. Suppose a=1: then product_{z^13=1} (z - 1) = 0, which fits because (1 - 1)Φ₁₃(1) = 0 * something = 0. If a ≠ 1, then product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = (a - 1)Φ₁₃(a). So, yes, that seems correct.

Okay, so applying that here, product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = (a - 1)Φ₁₃(a). So, for our problem, the product over z of (z - a)(z - b) = product_{z} (z - a) * product_{z} (z - b) = (a - 1)(b - 1)Φ₁₃(a)Φ₁₃(b).

So, P = product_{z} (z² - 2z + 2) = product_{z} (z - a)(z - b) where a and b are roots of z² - 2z + 2 = 0.

So, first, let's find the roots a and b of z² - 2z + 2 = 0. We can compute them using the quadratic formula:

z = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i.

So a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.

Thus, P = product_{z^13=1} (z - a)(z - b) = (a - 1)(b - 1)Φ₁₃(a)Φ₁₃(b).

Wait, because product_{z} (z - a) = (a - 1)Φ₁₃(a) and similarly for b.

So, P = (a - 1)(b - 1)Φ₁₃(a)Φ₁₃(b).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (a - 1)(b - 1). Since a = 1 + i, then a - 1 = i. Similarly, b = 1 - i, so b - 1 = -i. So (a - 1)(b - 1) = i * (-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

Next, we need to compute Φ₁₃(a) and Φ₁₃(b). Φ₁₃(z) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(z) = z^{12} + z^{11} + ... + z + 1.

So, Φ₁₃(a) = a^{12} + a^{11} + ... + a + 1, and similarly for Φ₁₃(b).

But a = 1 + i, so let's compute Φ₁₃(a). Hmm, computing this directly might be tedious, but perhaps we can find a pattern or a smarter way.

Alternatively, since Φ₁₃(z) = (z^{13} - 1)/(z - 1) when z ≠ 1. So, Φ₁₃(a) = (a^{13} - 1)/(a - 1).

Wait, that's a useful identity. So Φ₁₃(a) = (a^{13} - 1)/(a - 1), provided that a ≠ 1. Since a = 1 + i, which is not 1, this holds.

Similarly, Φ₁₃(b) = (b^{13} - 1)/(b - 1).

So, let's compute a^{13} and b^{13}.

Since a = 1 + i, let's compute a^13. Hmm, but 1 + i is a complex number. Maybe we can express it in polar form. The modulus of a is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is 45 degrees or π/4 radians.

So, a = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Thus, a^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (sqrt(2))^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

The angle 13π/4 can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2π. 13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π/4 (since 3π is equivalent to -π modulo 2π). Wait, actually, 13π/4 = 3π + π/4. But 3π is more than 2π, so subtract 2π: 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So, e^{i13π/4} = e^{i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-√2/2) - i(√2/2).

Thus, a^{13} = 64√2 * [ (-√2/2) - i√2/2 ) ].

Multiply this out: 64√2 * (-√2/2) = 64 * (√2 * √2) * (-1/2) )= 64 * 2 * (-1/2) )= 64 * (-1) )= -64.

Similarly, 64√2 * (-i√2/2) = 64 * (√2 * √2) * (-i/2) )= 64 * 2 * (-i/2) )= 64 * (-i) )= -64i.

So, a^{13} = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, compute b^{13}, where b = 1 - i.

Expressed in polar form, b has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4. So, b = sqrt(2) e^{-iπ/4}.

Thus, b^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i13π/4}.

Again, (sqrt(2))^{13} is 64√2.

The angle -13π/4 can be adjusted by adding multiples of 2π. Let's compute -13π/4 + 4π = (-13π/4 + 16π/4) = 3π/4. Alternatively, since 13π/4 is 5π/4 as before, so e^{-i13π/4} = e^{-i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-√2/2) + i√2/2.

So, b^{13} = 64√2 [ (-√2/2) + i√2/2 ) ].

Multiplying this out: 64√2 * (-√2/2) = -64, and 64√2 * (i√2/2) = 64 * (i * 2)/2 )= 64i.

Thus, b^{13} = -64 + 64i.

Now, compute Φ₁₃(a) = (a^{13} - 1)/(a - 1) = (-64 - 64i - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = (-65 - 64i)/(i).

Similarly, Φ₁₃(b) = (b^{13} - 1)/(b - 1) = (-64 + 64i - 1)/( (1 - i) - 1 ) = (-65 + 64i)/(-i).

Let me compute Φ₁₃(a):

(-65 - 64i)/i. To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

[ (-65 - 64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) )= [65i + 64i^2 ] / (1) )= 65i - 64 (since i^2 = -1).

So Φ₁₃(a) = -64 + 65i.

Similarly, compute Φ₁₃(b):

(-65 + 64i)/(-i) = [ (-65 + 64i) ] / (-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i:

[ (-65 + 64i) * i ] / ( (-i)*i )= [ -65i + 64i^2 ] / 1 )= -65i -64 (since i^2 = -1).

So Φ₁₃(b) = -64 -65i.

Now, we have P = (a - 1)(b - 1) Φ₁₃(a) Φ₁₃(b )= 1 * [ (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) ].

Wait, because (a-1)(b-1)=1, as computed earlier, so P = 1 * (-64 + 65i)*(-64 -65i).

Compute the product of (-64 + 65i) and (-64 -65i): it's a difference of squares, so (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (65^2 * i^2) = 4096 - (4225 * (-1)) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Wait, let me compute:

(-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

So P = 8321.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication:

(-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)(-64) + (-64)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (65i)(-65i).

Which is 4096 + 4160i -4160i - (65^2)i^2.

Simplify:

4096 + 0i - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Yep, that's correct.

So the product P is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this is divided by 1000.

Compute 8321 mod 1000. Well, 1000 * 8 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So the remainder is 321.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, when I computed (a-1)(b-1), a=1+i, so a-1=i. Similarly, b=1-i, so b-1= -i. So (a-1)(b-1) = i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1. That's correct.

Then, Φ₁₃(a) was computed as (-64 -64i -1)/i = (-65 -64i)/i. Then I multiplied numerator and denominator by -i to get [ (-65 -64i)*(-i) ] / (i*(-i)) )= (65i +64i^2 ) /1 = 65i -64. So that's correct.

Similarly, Φ₁₃(b) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) after simplifying, which gave me (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)*i/(i^2) = (-65i +64i^2)/(-1) )= (-65i -64)/(-1) = 65i +64, but wait, wait, let me check that again.

Wait, when I did it earlier, I think I might have made a mistake in the computation of Φ₁₃(b). Let me re-examine that step.

Φ₁₃(b) = (b^{13} - 1)/(b - 1). As computed before, b^{13} = -64 +64i.

So, Φ₁₃(b) = (-64 +64i -1)/( (1 - i) -1 ) = (-65 +64i)/( -i ).

Now, (-65 +64i)/(-i) can be simplified by multiplying numerator and denominator by i:

[ (-65 +64i)*i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ (-65i +64i^2) ] / (1) )= (-65i -64) because i^2 = -1.

So, Φ₁₃(b) = -64 -65i.

Wait, so that's correct as before. Then, when I multiplied Φ₁₃(a) and Φ₁₃(b), which are (-64 +65i) and (-64 -65i), their product is (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 +4225 = 8321. So that's correct.

Thus, the product P is 8321, which modulo 1000 is 321. So the remainder is 321.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. Let me recap:

- The product is over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2) for k=0 to 12.

- Each term is a quadratic in ω^k, which factors as (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b), where a and b are 1 + i and 1 - i.

- Then the product over all ω^k of (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b) is equal to product_{z} (z - a)(z - b) where z runs through all 13th roots of unity.

- That's equal to (a-1)(b-1)Φ₁₃(a)Φ₁₃(b), as computed earlier.

- Computed each Φ₁₃(a) and Φ₁₃(b) as (-64 ±65i) after simplifying, and their product is 8321.

Thus, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, I think that's the correct answer.


The product is evaluated by recognizing that each term can be factored into a quadratic in ω^k. Using properties of cyclotomic polynomials and the roots of unity, the product is simplified to 8321. The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.

\boxed{321}
