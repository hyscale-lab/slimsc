Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The a² is 20, so a is sqrt(20), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5). The b² is 24, so b is 2*sqrt(6). 

The asymptotes for such a hyperbola are y = ±(b/a)x. Plugging in the values, that's y = ±(2√6)/(2√5)x, which simplifies to y = ±(√6/√5)x, or y = ±(√30/5)x. Not sure if I'll need that yet, but it's good to note.

Now, the problem involves points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus. ABCD is a rhombus, so all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, actually, wait—no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, I think I confused that with a kite. Let me recall: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's right. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD, and they intersect at the origin because the rhombus is such that its diagonals intersect at the origin.

So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That means points A and C are diametrically opposite with respect to the origin, and similarly, B and D are diametrically opposite. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y), right? Similarly for B and D.

So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes, because the diagonals are perpendicular and intersect at the origin. So, points A and C are reflections over the origin, as are B and D.

Given that, I can represent the coordinates of the four points as follows:

Let’s let point A be (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, let point B be (p, q), so point D is (-p, -q). 

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, substitute these into the hyperbola equation:

For A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

For B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

Similarly for C and D, but since they're just negatives, they satisfy the same equation.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all four sides must be equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.

Wait, but with diagonals intersecting at the origin, maybe it's easier to work with vectors or coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the points. Since the hyperbola is symmetric, maybe points A and B can be represented in terms of parameters.

Alternatively, think in terms of coordinates. Let’s denote points A, B, C, D as (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q). So, the rhombus is formed by these four points.

In a rhombus, the sides are equal, so the distance from A to B equals the distance from B to C, and so on.

But maybe instead of directly using distance, I can use vectors or slopes to find relations between (x, y) and (p, q).

Alternatively, since diagonals bisect each other, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.

Wait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p.

Since diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. So, (y/x) * (q/p) = -1 → y q = -x p.

So, y q = - x p.

That's one equation connecting the coordinates of A and B.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, etc., are equal in length. Let's compute AB² and AD² and set them equal.

Wait, but since all sides are equal, AB² = BC², BC² = CD², etc. Maybe we can just compute AB² and AD² and set them equal.

Compute AB squared: (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2

Compute AD squared: (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2

Set them equal:

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: (p² - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²) = p² + q² - 2px - 2qy + x² + y²

Right side: [(-p -x)^2] = p² + 2px + x²; similarly, [(-q - y)^2] = q² + 2qy + y²

So, right side is p² + 2px + x² + q² + 2qy + y²

Set equal:

p² + q² - 2px - 2qy + x² + y² = p² + q² + 2px + 2qy + x² + y²

Subtract p² + q² + x² + y² from both sides:

-2px -2qy = 2px + 2qy
