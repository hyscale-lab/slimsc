Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each of which is colored red or blue. Rotating the octagon can permute the vertices, and we want the set of blue vertices after this rotation to exactly match the set that was originally red. So, in other words, if we rotate the octagon by some number of positions, the new blue vertices should be exactly the same as the original red ones.

Wait, does that mean that the set of blue vertices must form a rotation of the set of red vertices? Because if you rotate the octagon, the positions where the reds were will now be occupied by the blues from some rotated position. So the blue set must be a rotated version of the red set.

But since the octagon has rotational symmetry, the number of ways to rotate it is equal to the number of its rotational symmetries, which is 8. So for each coloring, we can check whether any of the 8 possible rotations maps the blue vertices to the red ones.

But wait, actually, the problem states that the octagon is colored with red and blue, and then we can rotate it so that all blue vertices end up at red positions. So, this requires that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because after rotation, the blue ones should align with the original reds.

So, in other words, the set of blue points must be a rotated version of the set of red points. Which would imply that the number of blue points must equal the number of red points. So, 4 red and 4 blue. But wait, the octagon has an even number of vertices, so this is possible. But if the number of red and blue vertices isn't equal, then such a rotation isn't possible because you can't have a rotation that maps a set of size k to a set of size 8 - k unless k = 8 - k, which is only possible when k =
