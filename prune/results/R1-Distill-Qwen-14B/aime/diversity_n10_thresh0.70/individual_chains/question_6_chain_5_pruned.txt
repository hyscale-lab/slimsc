Okay, I've got this problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, there's a function f(x) defined as ||x| - 1/2|, and another function g(x) defined as ||x| - 1/4|. Then, I'm supposed to find the number of intersections between the graphs of y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, okay, that's a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I think I need to understand what these functions f and g look like. Let me start by analyzing f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So, f is the composition of absolute values. Let me visualize it. The innermost part is |x|, which is a V-shaped graph with the vertex at (0,0). Then, we subtract 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. That would shift the graph down by 1/2 unit. But since we're taking the absolute value of that, any negative parts will be reflected upwards. So, let me think: when |x| - 1/2 is negative, which occurs when |x| < 1/2, then ||x| - 1/2| becomes 1/2 - |x|. When |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, it remains |x| - 1/2.

So, the graph of f(x) will have a V shape that is flipped in the region where |x| < 1/2. Let me sketch it mentally. Between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, the graph is a downward-opening V with vertex at (0,1/2). Then, outside of that interval, it's an upward-opening V starting at x = ±1/2, y = 0, going upwards. So, f(x) has a W shape, actually, because it has three segments: two linear increasing parts and a central decreasing part.

Similarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|. Using the same logic, |x| is an upward V. Subtracting 1/4 gives |x| - 1/4. Taking the absolute value of that, so when |x| < 1/4, ||x| - 1/4| becomes 1/4 - |x|, which is a downward V in that region. When |x| >= 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4, which is upward V. So, the graph of g(x) will have a central downward V between -1/4 and 1/4 and upward Vs outside that interval.

Okay, so now I have f and g. Let's move on to the functions y and x in the problem.

The first equation is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). The second is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). These are parametric equations, I think, but they're set equal as two separate equations. So, we're looking for points (x, y) that satisfy both equations. So, for each x, I can compute y from the first equation, and then check if that y, when plugged into the second equation, gives back the same x. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this.

But maybe I should first try to understand what 4 g(f(...)) looks like. Let's consider the inner function first. Let's take f(sin(2πx)) for the first equation. The innermost function is sin(2πx). The sin function has a period of 1 because sin(2πx) completes a cycle every 1 unit in x. So, sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1 as x varies.

Then, we apply f to that, so f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let me analyze this. Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking absolute value of that, so f(sin(2πx)) will be 1/2 - |sin(2πx)| when |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, and |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 when |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2.

Wait, but |sin(2πx)| is always between 0 and 1, so when |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) becomes 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|. When |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, it's |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. So, the function f(sin(2πx)) will oscillate between 0 and 1/2. Because:

- When |sin(2πx)| = 0, f gives 1/2.
- When |sin(2πx)| = 1/2, f gives 0.
- Then, as |sin(2πx)| increases beyond 1/2 towards 1, f gives |sin(2πx)| - 1/2, which goes up to 1/2.

Wait, when |sin(2πx
