Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice picks a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says Bob's list has 2024 sets, and we need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. So Alice chooses set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob is creating a list of all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. And the total number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in A.

First, I think I need to figure out how the number of sets B relates to the set A. Let's denote A as {a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ} where a₁ < a₂ < ... < aₙ. Because it's a set, the elements are distinct and ordered.

Now, for each element a in A, Bob can form sets B where the maximum element is a. So for each a, how many such sets B are there? Well, if the maximum is a, then the other elements of B must be less than or equal to a. But since B is a finite nonempty set, for a particular a, the number of possible sets B with max element a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} that include a and are non-empty.

Wait, so for each a, the number of sets B where max(B) = a is equal to 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, you can choose any subset of the numbers from 1 to a-1, and then include a. The number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^{a-1}, and each of those subsets combined with {a} gives a set B where max(B) = a.

Wait, but actually, if B is non-empty, then for each a, the number of such sets is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} where the maximum is a. Which is the same as the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} because you have to include a and can include any combination of the others. So that's 2^{a-1} sets.

So the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}.

But wait, let me check that.

Suppose A has elements {1, 2}. Then for a=1, the number of sets is 2^{0}=1, which is just {1}. For a=2, the number of sets is 2^{1}=2, which are {2} and {1,2}. So total sets are 3. But wait, are we considering all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum is in A? So in this case, yes, for A={1,2}, the possible Bs are {1}, {2}, {1,2}, which is 3 sets. So that works.

Another example: If A is {2}, then the number of sets is 2^{1}=
