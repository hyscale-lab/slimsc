Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what it's asking.

It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Finally, I have to report the integer m inside a box.

Alright, so the first step is to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. Then, once I have that p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, let me think about primes and how they interact with numbers of the form n⁴ + 1. I remember that primes can sometimes divide numbers like n² + 1 or n⁴ + 1 if they satisfy certain conditions.

First, let me recall that primes that divide n² + 1 must be congruent to 1 mod 4 because if a prime p divides n² + 1, then n² ≡ -1 mod p. This implies that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p, which only happens if p ≡ 1 mod 4. The same logic might apply to n⁴ + 1, but maybe it's a bit different.

Wait, n⁴ + 1 factors as (n² + √2n + 1)(n² - √2n +1) in the complex numbers, but over integers, it doesn't factor. So, primes p dividing n⁴ +1, maybe we can consider the order of n modulo p. If p divides n⁴ +1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Squaring both sides, n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p divides 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4, because then n⁴ ≡ 1 mod p, which contradicts n⁴ ≡ -1. So the order must be 8, which means that 8 divides p-1 (by Fermat's little theorem, since the multiplicative order divides p-1). So p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but is that the only possibility? Let me think. If p is 2, does 2 divide n⁴ +1? Let's see. n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod 2. If n is even, n⁴ is 0 mod 2, so n⁴ +1 is 1 mod 2. If n is odd, n⁴ is 1 mod 2, so n⁴ +1 is 0 mod 2. So 2 divides n⁴ +1 when n is odd. But does 2² divide n⁴ +1 for some n? Let's check n=1: 1 +1=2, which is 2 mod 4, not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82. 82 mod 4 is 2 again. Similarly, n=5: 625 +1=626, which is 626 mod 4 is 2. So 4 does not divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So 2 is out as a candidate for p because p²=4 doesn't divide any n⁴ +1.

So, moving on, the next primes are 5, 13, 17, etc., primes that are 1 mod 8. Wait, is 5 congruent to 1 mod 8? 5 mod8 is 5, so no. Let me clarify. The earlier reasoning suggested that primes p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p must have order 8, hence p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, 5: let's see if 5 divides any n⁴ +1
