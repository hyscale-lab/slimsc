Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, I think. O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. The segment AB connects these two points.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, PQ is a line segment from some point (p,0) to (0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, right? And the length of PQ is 1. So, the distance between P and Q should be 1.

Since PQ is in the first quadrant, both p and q are positive. So, for each such segment, we can have a different p and q as long as the distance between them is 1. So, the family F is all such possible segments PQ with unit length.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, not A or B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB. So, C is on AB, and for any other segment in F, C is not on it. So, C is only on AB and no other segments from F.

We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. So, AB is a line segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The equation of line AB can be found.

First, let me find the equation of AB. The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Since it passes through A(1/2, 0), plug in x = 1/2, y = 0:

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2.

So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).

Now, the point C cannot be on any other segment PQ from F except AB. So, for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

But PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1 (since the length is 1). So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, if point C is on PQ, then substituting C into the equation, we get x/p + y/q = 1.

But since C is not on any other PQ except AB, this equation should only hold when PQ is AB itself.

Wait, but PQ is any segment from F, except AB. So, how do we ensure that C is not on any other PQ? It must satisfy that for all other PQ in F, x/p + y/q ≠ 1.

But maybe another approach: since C is on AB, and also on PQ only if PQ is AB. So, we can parametrize C and find the conditions where C is not on any other PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because if C is only on AB and no other PQ, it might be the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

So, what's the envelope of all segments PQ in F? The envelope is the set of points that are on exactly one segment from F. So, for each PQ in F, the envelope is the curve that touches each PQ at exactly one point. So, if C is on AB and on the envelope, then AB is tangent to the envelope at C, so C is the only point of intersection between AB and the envelope.

So, maybe I need to find the envelope of all segments PQ in F and then find the point of tangency with AB.

To find the envelope, I can parametrize F. Let me think about how to parametrize these segments. Each segment is PQ from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1.

So, for each p in (0,1), q = sqrt(1 - p²). So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

So, the family of lines is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1, where p varies between 0 and 1.

To find the envelope, I can use the method where for each p, the envelope satisfies both the equation of the line and the derivative with respect to p is zero.

So, let me denote the equation as F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) - 1 = 0.

Then, the condition for the envelope is that F(p, x, y) = 0 and d
