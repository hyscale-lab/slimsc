Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon is a 12-sided polygon, right? So, I'm dealing with a 12-sided figure, and I need to find how many rectangles can be formed with their sides aligned along the sides or diagonals of this shape.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a polygon with 12 equal sides and 12 equal angles. Each internal angle can be calculated, but I'm not sure if I need that right now. The key thing is that it's regular, so all sides and angles are equal, and it's symmetric.

The problem mentions that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangles can't be just any lines; they have to coincide with the existing sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. That suggests that the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon, connecting two vertices or possibly midpoints? Wait, no, the sides are either sides or diagonals, so they connect vertices.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, a diagonal is a line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. So, the diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a polygon, a diagonal can connect to the next vertex (which would just be a side), but in a dodecagon, sides are only between adjacent vertices. So diagonals are lines connecting vertices with one or more vertices in between.

So, in a regular dodecagon, the number of sides is 12, and the number of diagonals is C(12,2) - 12 = 66 -12 =54. So, 54 diagonals. But not all diagonals are the same length. In a regular polygon, diagonals can be classified by how many vertices they skip. So in a dodecagon, the diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 vertices. Wait, but skipping 6 would connect opposite vertices, making a diameter of the circumscribed circle.

But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant. Maybe I should think about the structure of the dodecagon and how rectangles can be formed. Rectangles require four sides with four right angles. So, in the context of a regular dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must be such that they form right angles where they meet.

I remember that in regular polygons, certain diagonals can form right angles with others, especially if the polygon is symmetric. Since the dodecagon is regular, it's symmetric, so maybe there are multiple ways to choose four points that form a rectangle.

Wait, but how can four points in a regular dodecagon form a rectangle? Well, if opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the diagonals are equal and intersect at right angles, then it's a rectangle.

So, perhaps the key is to find all sets of four vertices that form a
