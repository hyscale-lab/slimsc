Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some concepts. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. I remember that in some cases, when certain lines are perpendicular, you can use the Pythagorean theorem or some properties related to distances and angles.

I also remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Oh, yes, Euler's formula for the distance between incenter and circumcenter is OI² = R(R - 2r). So, given that R is 13 and r is 6, let me compute OI.

OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, that's a manageable number.

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, IA is perpendicular to OI. That makes triangle IOA a right-angled triangle at I. So, by Pythagoras theorem, OA² = OI² + IA².

Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. OI is sqrt(13). So, 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA². Let me compute that.

13² is 169, and (sqrt(13))² is 13. So, 169 =13 + IA², which gives IA² =169 -13=156. So IA = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that. 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39)=2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). That's the length from inradius I to vertex A.

Now, I need to relate this to the sides of the triangle. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and sides.

Wait, the formula for the length of the angle bisector? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities related to the inradius and exradius.

Wait, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be found using the formula:

distance from I to A = (r) / sin(A/2)

Is that correct? Let me think. Actually, the inradius r is related to the distance from I
