Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Hmm, that seems a bit abstract, but let me try to unpack it.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We have a regular octagon, so it's an eight-sided polygon with all sides and angles equal. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with probability 1/2. Then, we want the probability that there exists some rotation of the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. Wait, so after rotation, the blue vertices have to align with the red ones. Interesting.

So, to rephrase, after coloring, if we rotate the octagon by some multiple of 45 degrees (since a full rotation is 360, and 360/8 = 45), the new positions of the blue vertices should all be red in the original coloring. That means that for some rotation, the set of blue vertices is exactly the same as the set of red vertices, but shifted by that rotation.

Wait, but the original coloring is fixed. So, suppose I have a coloring C. I can rotate C by k*45 degrees for some k from 0 to 7, and I want to check if any of these rotations result in the blue vertices aligning with red ones. So, maybe the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then rotating by that amount would make all blue vertices land on red positions.

Wait, but for that to happen, the number of blue and red vertices must be equal, right? Because otherwise, you can't have a rotation that maps one set onto the other. Since the octagon has 8 vertices, if the number of blue vertices is not equal to the number of red vertices, then such a rotation can't exist. So, that gives me a starting point: the number of blue vertices must be 4, because half of 8 is 4. So, the first thing is that the probability is only non-zero when exactly 4 vertices are blue and 4 are red.

So
