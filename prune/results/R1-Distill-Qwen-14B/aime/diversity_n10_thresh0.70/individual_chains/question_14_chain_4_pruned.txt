Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about finding the greatest four-digit number, N, with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once we find N, we need to find Q and R, which are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, we have to find Q + R.

First, let me break down the problem. We need a four-digit number N, which is the greatest such number. So, N is between 9999 and 1000. The key property is that changing any one digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 results in a number that's a multiple of 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, A is the thousands digit, B is the hundreds, C is the tens, and D is the units digit. Since it's the greatest four-digit number, we want A to be as large as possible, then B, then C, then D.

Now, the problem states that changing any one digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. That means:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD is divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD is divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D is divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 is divisible by 7.

So, for each of these four modified numbers, they must be divisible by 7. Our task is to find the largest N = ABCD that satisfies all four conditions.

Since we want the greatest N, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find such an N. But that might take a long time manually, so perhaps we can find a smarter approach.

Let me think about the implications of each condition.

First, let's write each modified number in terms of N:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A)/10 * 100 / 10? Wait, maybe another way.

Wait, N is ABCD, so N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

If we replace A with 1: N' = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So N' = 1000 + (N - 1000A) + 1000 - 1000A? Hmm, maybe not. Let me rephrase.

Wait, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change A to 1, we get N1 = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, changing B to 1: N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D.

Changing C to 1: N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D.

Changing D to 1: N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me express each N1, N2, N3, N4 in terms of N.

N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, so N - 1000A = 100B + 10C + D.

So, N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

Similarly, N1 = 1000 + (N mod 1000).

But 1000 is 1000, which is 1000 mod 7. Let me compute 1000 mod 7.

7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's compute each modified number mod 7.

Starting with N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

But N - 1000A = 100B + 10C + D.

So, N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Modulo 7, N1 ≡ 1000 mod7 + 100B mod7 + 10C mod7 + D mod7.

Which is 6 + (2B) + (3C) + D ≡ 0 mod7.

Similarly, N2 is changing B to 1: N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D.

Modulo 7, N2 ≡ (1000A mod7) + (100*1 mod7) + (10C mod7) + (D mod7).

1000 ≡6, so 1000A mod7 =6A.

100*1 mod7 = 2.

10C mod7=3C.

D mod7=D.

So N2 ≡6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N3 is changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D.

Modulo7: 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

And N4 is changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C +1.

Modulo7:6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, summarizing the four conditions:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (From N1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (From N2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7. (From N3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7. (From N4)

These are four congruences that must all be satisfied.

Our goal is to find the largest N=ABCD (four-digit number) satisfying these four congruences.

Let me see if I can find relationships between these equations.

Let me denote the four equations as Eq1, Eq2, Eq3, Eq4.

Equation 1: 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7 (since 6 ≡6, so 6 + ... ≡0 => ... ≡1 mod7)

Equation 2:6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7 (since 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 => 6A +3C + D ≡-2 ≡5 mod7)

Equation 3:6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7 (since 6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 => 6A +2B + D ≡-3 ≡4 mod7)

Equation4:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 (since 6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 => 6A +2B +3C ≡-1 ≡6 mod7)

Hmm, that's four equations.

Let me write them down:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7  -- Eq1
2.6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7    -- Eq2
3.6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7    -- Eq3
4.6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7    -- Eq4

Let me try to find relationships between these equations.

First, subtract Eq2 - Eq3:

[6A +3C + D] - [6A +2B + D] ≡5 -4 mod7

Which simplifies to (3C - 2B) ≡1 mod7.

So, 3C - 2B ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Eq5.

Similarly, subtract Eq1 from Eq4:

[6A +2B +3C] - [2B +3C + D] ≡6 -1 mod7

Which simplifies to 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So, 6A - D ≡5 mod7. Let's call this Eq6.

Now, let's see what else we can do.

From Eq6: 6A - D ≡5 mod7 => D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, D is congruent to (6A -5) mod7.

Similarly, from Eq5: 3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

Let me also try to find another relationship.

Looking at Eq3:6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

We can substitute D from Eq6 into Eq3.

So, 6A +2B + (6A -5) ≡4 mod7.

Simplify:

6A +2B +6A -5 ≡4 mod7

12A +2B -5 ≡4 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5, so 5A +2B -5 ≡4 mod7.

Which simplifies to 5A +2B ≡9 mod7.

9 mod7 is 2, so 5A +2B ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Eq7.

Similarly, from Eq5:3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

Let me see if I can express B in terms of C, or vice versa.

From Eq5: 3C -2B ≡1 mod7 => 3C ≡2B +1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, inverse of 3 is 5.

So, C ≡5*(2B +1) mod7 => C ≡10B +5 mod7 => C ≡3B +5 mod7.

So, C ≡3B +5 mod7. Let's call this Eq8.

Similarly, from Eq7:5A +2B ≡2 mod7.

Let me try to express B in terms of A.

2B ≡2 -5A mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod7. 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so inverse is 4.

B ≡4*(2 -5A) mod7 => B ≡8 -20A mod7.

Simplify:

8 mod7 is 1, 20 mod7 is 6 (since 7*2=14, 20-14=6), so 20A mod7=6A.

Thus, B ≡1 -6A mod7.

So, B ≡(1 -6A) mod7. Let's call this Eq9.

Now, let's collect the expressions we have:

From Eq8: C ≡3B +5 mod7.

From Eq9: B ≡1 -6A mod7.

Substitute Eq9 into Eq8:

C ≡3*(1 -6A) +5 mod7.

Compute:

3*1=3, 3*(-6A)= -18A.

So, C ≡3 -18A +5 mod7.

Combine constants: 3+5=8≡1 mod7.

So, C ≡1 -18A mod7.

But 18 mod7 is 4 (since 7*2=14, 18-14=4).

Thus, C ≡1 -4A mod7.

So, C ≡(1 -4A) mod7. Let's call this Eq10.

So, now we have expressions for B and C in terms of A.

Also, from Eq6: D ≡6A -5 mod7. Eq6.

So, now, all variables B, C, D can be expressed in terms of A modulo7.

But since A is a digit (1-9 for four-digit number), but since N is four-digit, A is from 1 to9.

Wait, no. Wait, N is a four-digit number, so A is from 1 to9, but since we are looking for the greatest N, we should probably start with A=9 and work downwards.

But let's see.

We need to find digits B, C, D (each from 0-9) such that:

B ≡(1 -6
