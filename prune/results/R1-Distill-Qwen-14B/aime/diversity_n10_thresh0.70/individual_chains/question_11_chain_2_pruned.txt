Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to find the largest possible real part of this expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers can sometimes be tricky, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then the reciprocal of z is (z̄)/r². So, since |z| is 4, |z|² is 16. That might be useful for dealing with the 1/z term.

Let me write z in a more manageable form. Since |z| = 4, z can be expressed as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can represent z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). That might make it easier to handle when I substitute it into the expression.

So, let's substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|², right?

Substituting, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately. First, compute (75 + 117i)*4. 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468, so that becomes 300 + 468i. So the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Now, for the second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) is (24 + 36i). So, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now the expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Let me write this as:

A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}, where A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i.

Hmm, I think there's a trigonometric identity that can help here. I remember that for expressions like A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}, we can write them in terms of cosine and sine functions. Let me recall that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, expanding the expression:

A (cosθ + i sinθ) + B (cosθ - i sinθ)

Which is equal to (A + B) cosθ + i(A - B) sinθ.

Wait, let me check that:

A cosθ + A i sinθ + B cosθ - B i sinθ

So, grouping like terms: (A + B) cosθ + (A - B) i sinθ.

Yes, that seems right.

So now, the expression is (A + B) cosθ + i(A - B) sinθ.

But the original expression is a complex number, and we need its real part. So, the real part is the real component of this expression. Let me write A and B in terms of their real and imaginary parts.

A is 300 + 468i, so Re(A) = 300, Im(A) = 468.

B is 24 + 36i, so Re(B) = 24, Im(B) = 36.

So, A + B is (300 + 24) + (468 + 36)i = 324 + 504i.

Similarly, A - B is (300 - 24) + (468 - 36)i = 276 + 432i.

So substituting back into the expression, the real part is Re[(A + B) cosθ + i(A - B) sinθ] = Re[(324 + 504i) cosθ + i(276 + 432i) sinθ].

But wait, let me make sure. The entire expression is (A + B) cosθ + i(A - B) sinθ. So, the real part is the real component of this. Let me break it
