Okay, so I've got this problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it and figure out how to approach it. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles from set theory, so maybe that will come into play here.

Alright, let's list out the given information:

- Total number of residents: 900.
- Number of residents who own a diamond ring: 195.
- Number who own a set of golf clubs: 367.
- Number who own a garden spade: 562.
- Every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's 900 people for that category.
- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.
- 234 own exactly three of them.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Hmm, let's think. Since every resident owns at least a candy heart, we can consider the candy hearts as something everyone has. So when considering the other three items, the problem is similar to finding overlaps among those three, but keeping in mind that all of them are within the 900.

Wait, but the problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So candy hearts are universal. So any ownership of the other three items is in addition to that. So when counting overlaps, the fourth item (candy hearts) is always present. So when we talk about someone owning exactly two things, does that include the candy hearts? Or are they considering only the three specific things?

Wait, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So candy hearts are a given for everyone. So when the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things, I think it's referring to exactly two of the three: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. Because candy hearts are already included in all of them.

Similarly, the 234 who own exactly three of these things would be those who have all three: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, plus the candy hearts, making it four items. So the 'exactly three' here refers to the three non-candy heart items. So when they own exactly three, it's those three plus candy hearts, meaning four items in total. But wait, the question is asking for the number who own all four, which would be the same as those who own all three of the other items. Because the candy heart is already included.

Wait, but hold on. Let me clarify. The problem states: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So candy hearts are a must. So when the problem says, for example, that 195 own a diamond ring, that's in addition to the candy hearts. So each of these ownership counts (diamond, golf, garden) is separate from the candy hearts. So, when someone owns exactly two things, those are two of the other three (diamond, golf, garden) plus the candy heart. So each of these ownership numbers can be broken down into how many have exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, etc., of the non-candy heart items.

So let's model this with sets. Let me denote:

- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- Let G be the set of people who own a set of golf clubs.
- Let S be the set of people who own a garden spade.
- Let C be the set of people who own candy hearts. Since C is everyone, it's the universal set.

So, D, G, S are subsets of C. The total number of people is |C| = 900.

We need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C includes everyone, this is just |D ∩ G ∩ S|, which is the number of people who own all three non-candy heart items.

Given:

- |D| =
