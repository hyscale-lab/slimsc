Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes she spends in a coffee shop. Then, when she walks at a faster speed, specifically 's + 2' kilometers per hour, her walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, the question is asking, if she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how many minutes will her walk take, including the 't' minutes at the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, it seems like we need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h. But to find that, I think we first need to figure out what 's' and 't' are.

Let me break it down.

First, when walking at speed 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours. But this includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time 't' (in minutes). Similarly, when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. Wait, actually, 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So, 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. 24 minutes is 0.4 hours? Yes, because 24 divided by 60 is 0.4. So, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2.4 hours.

But wait, in the first case, the total time is 4 hours, and in the second case, it's 2.4 hours. But both these times include the same 't' minutes. So, the time she actually spends walking is total time minus 't' minutes.

But wait, the problem is that both times include 't' minutes, so we can set up equations where the walking time plus 't' equals the total time.

Let me write that down.

Let me denote:

Total time when speed is 's' km/h: 4 hours, which includes walking time and 't' minutes.

Total time when speed is 's + 2' km/h: 2 hours and 24 minutes = 2.4 hours, which also includes walking time and 't' minutes.

But wait, the total time is in hours, and 't' is given in minutes. So, maybe I should convert everything to minutes to make it easier.

Yes, that probably makes sense.

So, 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

2 hours and 24 minutes is 2*60 + 24 = 120 +24 = 144 minutes.

So, for the first scenario: walking time + t = 240 minutes.

For the second scenario: walking time + t = 144 minutes.

Wait, but walking time is different in each scenario because the speed is different. So, let me denote the walking time at speed 's' as 'w1' and at speed 's + 2' as 'w2'.

So,

w1 + t = 240 (in minutes)

w2 + t = 144 (in minutes)

But also, since the distance is the same, 9 kilometers, the time she spends walking (w1 and w2) can be expressed in terms of speed.

So, time = distance / speed.

But wait, the time is in minutes, and the speed is in km/h. So, I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I should handle the times in hours.

Let me try that approach.

If I convert
