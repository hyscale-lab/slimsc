Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have specific properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it means that ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k from 0 to 12 are all distinct. Also, the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero, which might come in handy somewhere.

The expression I need to compute is the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write this as P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating, but maybe I can find a pattern or relate it to some polynomial.

I recall that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 would be x^13 - 1, but that's not exactly what I have here. The expression inside the product is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor it or rewrite it in a way that relates to known polynomials.

Let me look at the term 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let's rearrange it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. I wonder if this can be expressed as a quadratic in ω^k. Let's consider it as a quadratic equation: (ω^{k})^2 - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, maybe factor it or find its roots.

Alternatively, consider substituting x = ω^k. Then the term becomes x^2 - 2x + 2. Let's compute its discriminant: (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). 

So, each term in the product becomes (ω^k - (1+i))(ω^k - (1-i)). Therefore, the entire product P is the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1+i))(ω^k - (1-i)).

Wait, so P = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1+i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1-i))]. 

Hmm, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) over k is x^13 - 1. But since we're excluding k=0 because ω^0 = 1, maybe I need to adjust for that.

Wait, no, in our case, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes ω^0 = 1. So actually, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if I let x = 1+i, then ∏_{k=0}^{12} (1+i - ω^k) = (1+i)^13 - 1. Similarly, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (1-i - ω^k) = (1-i)^13 - 1.

Ah, so P = [ (1+i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1-i)^13 -
