Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, but I'm not sure if that's immediately relevant here.

The problem is about rectangles. Rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, in the context of a dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must lie along either the sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals.

I think I should start by considering the properties of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it's symmetric, so maybe I can use some symmetry to simplify the problem.

I recall that in a regular polygon, the number of diagonals can be calculated using the formula n(n-3)/2, where n is the number of sides. For a dodecagon, that would be 12*(12-3)/2 = 12*9/2 = 54 diagonals. But I'm not sure if I need to count diagonals directly here.

Wait, the problem is about rectangles, so maybe I need to think in terms of selecting points and checking if they form rectangles. But since it's a dodecagon, all vertices are equally spaced around a circle. So, maybe the key is to find sets of four points that form rectangles.

But how do I ensure that the sides of the rectangle lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon? Hmm, perhaps each side of the rectangle must be a chord of the dodecagon's circumcircle, and these chords must align with the sides or diagonals.

Let me visualize a dodecagon. It has 12 vertices, say labeled 0 through 11 in order. For four points to form a rectangle, they must satisfy the rectangle properties: opposite sides equal and parallel, and the diagonals equal and bisecting each other.

But since all points are on a circle, any rectangle inscribed in the circle must have its vertices lying on the circle, right? Because the dodecagon is regular, it's inscribed in a circle, so all its vertices are on the circumference.

Wait, but not all rectangles inscribed in a circle are aligned with the dodecagon's sides or diagonals. So, I think the rectangles must have their sides coinciding with sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

So, each side of the rectangle must be a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. That means each side of the rectangle must be one of the edges or chords of the dodecagon.

Hmm, maybe I can model the problem by considering the dodecagon's vertices and looking for quadrilaterals that are rectangles, with their sides aligned as such.

Let me think about how the sides of the dodecagon and its diagonals can form rectangles.

In a regular polygon, the length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices it skips. For example, in a dodecagon, a diagonal can skip 1, 2, 3, etc., vertices.

Wait, but the sides of the dodecagon are the edges connecting consecutive vertices, so they are the shortest chords. The diagonals are longer, connecting non-consecutive vertices.

So, for the rectangle's sides to lie on sides or diagonals, their lengths must correspond to the lengths of the dodecagon's sides or diagonals.

But since a rectangle has opposite sides equal, the sides of the rectangle must come in pairs of equal length. So, for the rectangle, we need two different lengths, each corresponding to a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

Wait, but the sides of the dodecagon are all the same length, so a rectangle could have sides that are either sides of the dodecagon or diagonals. But
