Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that turns all the blue vertices into positions where they were originally red. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to unpack this. We're dealing with a regular octagon, which has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So each coloring is independent, right?

The key part is figuring out the probability that there exists a rotation such that all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So if I rotate the octagon by some multiple of 45 degrees (since it's regular), the blue ones should end up where reds were, and vice versa.

Wait, or maybe all the original reds are now blue? Hmm, no, no, the rotation should take the blue vertices to positions that were previously red. So, if a vertex is blue in the original coloring, after rotation, it's in a spot that was red before the rotation.

So, the condition is that there exists some rotation (i.e., some number of steps, like 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions) such that when we apply that rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was red in the original coloring.

Let me think about the implications. So, for a given coloring, we need that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because when you rotate the octagon, the reds become blues, or vice versa? Or wait, no, the blues are moving to where the reds were, but the reds are staying in place? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the rotation affects the positions. So, if you have a rotation by k positions, then each vertex i is moved to vertex (i + k) mod 8. The color of vertex i is either red or blue. After rotation, the color at position j is the color of position (j - k) mod 8 before the rotation.

So, for the condition that all blue vertices are moved to positions where there were originally red vertices, that would mean that for every blue vertex in position i, (i - k) mod 8 was red. Or wait, no, the problem says that after rotation, all the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. So, the rotated blue vertices should be on red positions.

Wait, so let me clarify. If we have an original coloring, and we rotate it by k positions, then the new color at position j is the original color at position (j - k) mod 8. So, the condition is that for every j, if the new color at j is blue, then the original color at (j - k) mod 8 was red.

But another way to think about it is that the set of blue vertices after rotation is a subset of the original red vertices. So, the set B' (blues after rotation) is a subset of R (reds originally). So, B' âŠ† R.

But since the rotation is a permutation, the size of B' is the same as the size of
