Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that maps all the blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then I need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's the denominator of my probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices are mapped to where red vertices were. So, I need to count how many such colorings exist.

Wait, the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. The group of rotations for an octagon is the cyclic group of order 8, right? So, rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°. Each rotation can be represented by an element of this group.

But the problem is, for a given coloring, I need to see if there's some rotation (other than the identity, maybe?) that moves all the blue vertices to positions that were red. Or wait, actually, does it include the identity rotation? Because if all blue vertices are mapped to red vertices, then the identity rotation would require that every blue vertex is a red vertex, but that's only possible if there are no blue vertices. Because if all are red, then the identity would work. But maybe the problem allows for the identity rotation as a possibility.

Wait, let me reread the problem. It says "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, does that include the identity rotation? Because if you rotate by 0°, which is just the identity, then all blue vertices stay where they are. So, for the identity rotation to satisfy the condition, it would require that every blue vertex was originally a red vertex. But that would mean there are no blue vertices, right? Because otherwise, there's a blue vertex that's supposed to map to a red vertex, but it maps to itself, which is blue.

So, in that case, the only coloring for which the identity rotation works is the all-red coloring. But maybe we should consider all possible rotations, including the identity, but I need to be careful whether the identity is considered a valid rotation for the problem or not. Because the problem says "rotated," which might imply a non-zero rotation, but it's not clear. Hmm.

Wait, let's think carefully. If the problem allows the identity rotation, then the only colorings that satisfy the condition are those where either all blue vertices are mapped to red vertices via some rotation. So, if there's a rotation (including identity) that does this, then the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but for the identity rotation, the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the red vertices. Which would only happen if all blue vertices are red, i.e., no blue vertices
