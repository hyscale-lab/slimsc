Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's try to break it down.

First, I know that z is a complex number with magnitude 4. That means z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I could write z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Maybe that will be helpful later.

The expression given is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote this expression as E for simplicity. So, E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since |z| = 4, then |1/z| = 1/4, because the magnitude of the reciprocal is the reciprocal of the magnitude. So, 1/z is just (z̄)/|z|², where z̄ is the complex conjugate of z. Since |z|² is 16, 1/z = z̄ / 16.

Hmm, maybe that's a useful representation. Let's try substituting that into E.

E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) * (z̄ / 16).

Simplify the second term: (96 + 144i)/16 = 6 + 9i. So, E becomes:

E = (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)z̄.

That's a bit simpler. Now, since z is 4e^{iθ}, its conjugate z̄ is 4e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting z and z̄ into E:

E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (6 + 9i)(4e^{-iθ}).

Let me compute the constants multiplied by z and z̄:

(75 + 117i)(4) = 300 + 468i.

(6 + 9i)(4) = 24 + 36i.

So, E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, this looks like a combination of exponentials. Maybe I can express this as a sum of complex exponentials and then find the real part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent z in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let me think: if z = a + bi, then |z| = sqrt(a² + b²) = 4, so a² + b² = 16.

But then, E would be (75 + 117i)(a + bi) + (96 + 144i)/(a + bi). Hmm, that might get a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.

Wait, another approach: Since |z| = 4, let's write z as 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, E can be written as:

E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute the constants first:

(75 + 117i)*4 = 300 + 468i.

(96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i.

So, E = (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I can express each term as a complex exponential. Let me write this as:

E = (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me compute each product separately.

First, expand (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ):

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ.

But i² = -1, so that last term becomes -468 sinθ.

So, grouping real and imaginary parts:

= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).

Similarly, expand (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ):

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ.

Again, i² = -1, so the last term is +36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

= (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Now, add these two results together to get E:

Real part:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary part:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So, E = [324 cosθ - 432 sinθ] + i [276 sinθ + 504 cosθ].

But we are interested in the real part of E, so Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to maximize Re(E). So, we can treat Re(E) as a function of θ:

Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of this expression.

Hmm, how do I find the maximum of an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ? Wait, but in this case, it's A cosθ - B sinθ. Let me recall that the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²).

Yes, that's right. The maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²), achieved when theta is such that (cosθ, sinθ) is in the direction of (A, B).

In this case, our expression
