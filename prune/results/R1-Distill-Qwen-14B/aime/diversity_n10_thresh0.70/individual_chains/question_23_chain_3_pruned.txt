Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where A, B, C, D are points on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, forming a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal and that its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, wait— hold on, I think I'm confusing with a square. Let me double-check: In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, and they are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. That's an important point.

So, given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD. That means if point A is (x, y), then point C should be (-x, -y), because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, points B and D are also reflections through the origin. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

So, the four points of the rhombus are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, which is equal to the distance from C to D, and so on.

Let me write the distance formula for AB and BC to set them equal.

AB distance squared: (p - x)² + (q - y)²

BC distance squared: (-x - p)² + (-y - q)²

So, setting them equal:

(p - x)² + (q - y)² = (-x - p)² + (-y - q)²

Expanding both sides:

Left side: (p² - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²)
Right side: (-x - p)² + (-y - q)² = (x + p)² + (y + q)² = (x² + 2px + p²) + (y² + 2qy + q²)

So, left side: p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y²

Right side: x² + 2px + p² + y² + 2qy + q²

Subtracting left side from right side:

(x² + 2px + p² + y² + 2qy + q²) - (p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y²) = 0

Simplify term by term:

x² cancels, p² cancels, y² cancels, q² cancels.

Left with: 2px + 2qy - (-2px - 2qy) = 0

Wait, that would be 2px + 2qy + 2px + 2qy = 0

So, 4px + 4qy = 0

Divide both sides by 4: px + qy = 0

So, this is the first condition: px + qy = 0

Hmm, that's one equation. Now, what else do I know? All four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y
