Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says: We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. Tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.

Hmm. Let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Since the sides are 5,9,10, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, the tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, no, D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, which makes D the exsymmedian point or something else? Maybe it's the ex-pole with respect to the triangle.

Wait, actually, the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole, but I'm not sure. Anyway, moving on.

AD intersects the circumcircle again at P. So, AP is a segment from A to P on ω, passing through D. So, we need to find the length AP.

Given the sides of triangle ABC, maybe I can compute some angles or use power of a point or something like that.

Let me think about the Power of a Point theorem because D is outside the circle, and we have tangents from D to ω. The power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² because both are tangents from D to ω.

So, Power of D: DB² = DC².

Also, since AD intersects ω at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω is also equal to DA * DP.

So, from Power of a Point, we have:

DB² = DA * DP.

Therefore, DP = DB² / DA.

But I don't know DA yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can find DA in terms of other lengths.

Wait, maybe I can find coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place the triangle in coordinate system to make it easier. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, point A is at (10, 0) because AC=10. Point B is somewhere in the plane; I need to find its coordinates.

Given AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute the coordinates of point B.

Let me denote point B as (x, y). Then, distance from C(0,0) to B is 9, so:

x² + y² = 81.  (1)

Distance from A(10,0) to B(x,y) is 5:

(10 - x)² + (0 - y)² = 25.  (2)

Expanding equation (2):

(10 - x)² + y² = 25

100 - 20x + x² + y² = 25

But from equation (1), x² + y² = 81, so substitute:

100 -20x +81 =25

200 -20x =25 → Wait, no, 100 +81 =181, so 181 -20x =25 → 181 -25 =20x → 156 =20x → x=156/20=39/5=7.8.

So, x=39/5=7.8. Then, from equation (1):

(39/5)^2 + y^2 =81.

Compute 39/5 squared: 39²=1521, 5²=25, so 1521/25 + y²=81.

So, y²=81 -1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 → y=√(504/25)=√504 /5.

Simplify √504: 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't a whole number. Wait, 504=16*31.5? No, wait, 504=16*31.5? Hmm, perhaps another factorization.

Wait, 504= 16*31.5? Wait, 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. Alternatively, 504= 7*72=7*9*8=7*9*8. So, √504=√(7*9*8)=3*2*sqrt(14)=6√14. Wait, let's see:

504=72*7= (36*2)*7= 36*14. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(36*14)=6√14. So, y=6√1
