Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, when we draw line AD, it intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, since ABC is inscribed in ω, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. That means points A, B, and C all lie on ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents? Hmm, I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. But maybe more importantly, since DB and DC are tangents from D to ω, they should be equal in length. So, DB = DC. That might come in handy.

Then, line AD intersects ω again at P. So, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P. Our goal is to find AP.

Given the sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me check if this is a valid triangle. 5 + 9 = 14 > 10, 5 + 10 =15>9, 9 +10=19>5. Yep, valid.

Perhaps first, I can compute some properties of triangle ABC, like its circumradius, since we're dealing with the circumcircle. Maybe that will help later.

To find the circumradius R of triangle ABC, I can use the formula:

R = (a*b*c) / (4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So, a=5, b=9, c=10. Let's compute the area Δ using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (5+9+10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, Δ = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[12*7*6] = sqrt[504].

Wait, 504 factors: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? No, wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not helpful. Let me factor 504 properly.

504: 504 ÷ 2 = 252, ÷2=126, ÷2=63, ÷3=21, ÷3=7. So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 *7.

Therefore, sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5) *3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)= 6*sqrt(14). Wait, that can't be right because 6^2 *14 = 36*14=504. So yes, sqrt(504)=6*sqrt(14). So, Δ =6√14.

So, R = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14) )= (450)/(24√14) = (450)/(24√14). Simplify that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 450 ÷6=75, 24 ÷6=4. So, 75/(4√14). Rationalize denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14, so (75√14)/(4*14)= (75√14)/56. So, R=75√14 /56.

Hmm, okay, so the circumradius is 75√14 divided by 56. I'll note that down.

Now, I need to find AP. AP is a chord from A to P on the circumcircle. So, AP is of length less than the diameter, which is 2R= (150√14)/56 =75√14/28. But AP is not necessarily the diameter, so I need another approach.

Given that D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, D lies on the external tangent line from B and C to ω. That makes D the ex-pole of BC or something. Since DB and DC are tangents, DB=DC as I thought earlier.

I remember that in circle geometry, the point D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Because the tangent points create equal angles with the sides, leading to symmedian properties. Alternatively, perhaps using power of a point.

Yes! Power of
