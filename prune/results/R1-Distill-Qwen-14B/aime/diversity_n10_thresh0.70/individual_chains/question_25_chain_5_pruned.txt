Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. 

First, let me list out all the information given. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns at least one of four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, or a bag of candy hearts. Wait, no, actually, the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts. Oh, so everyone owns at least a bag of candy hearts. That might be important.

So, specific numbers: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and all 900 own candy hearts. Wait, but candy hearts are something everyone has, so that's the universal set here. So, the four categories are diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). But since everyone has C, the problem is really about how many have D, G, or S along with C, but C is everywhere.

Now, the problem also mentions that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. We're supposed to find how many own all four.

Hmm, I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. It's used to calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets. The formula for four sets is a bit complicated, but let me try to recall.

The formula for four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| 
- |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D|
+ |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D|
- |A∩B∩C∩D|

But in our case, everyone owns C, so maybe we can adjust the problem accordingly. Let me think: since C is owned by everyone, the presence of C doesn't affect the counts because it's always there. So, perhaps it's better to model the problem without C as it's the universal set.

Wait, maybe it's easier to reframe the problem. Let's consider that all residents have C, so the other three items (D, G, S) are optional. So the problem reduces to how many people have combinations of D, G, S, with C always included.

So, the problem is about the three optional items: D, G, and S. Each resident can have any subset of these, but they must have C as well. The numbers given are about the total owning each, but since C is universal, the counts for D, G, S already include those who also have C. So, the counts for D, G, and S are the number of people who have those items plus C.

Wait, but the problem says 195 own a diamond ring. Since everyone owns C, that 195 is the count of people who have D and C. Similarly, 367 have G and C, 562 have S and C.

But wait, the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, C is a given for everyone. So, the sets D, G, S are subsets of the universal set C. Thus, the counts for D, G, S are all within C.

So, perhaps the problem can be modelled as three sets (D, G, S) within the universal set of 900, and we're to find the number of people in all three (D∩G∩S), because those would be the people who have all four items (since C is already included). Wait, because if someone is in D∩G∩S, they also have C, so they have all four.

But the problem states that there are 437 who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. So, let me think in terms of the Venn diagram for three sets: D, G, S.

In the Venn diagram for three sets, the regions are:

- Only D
- Only G
- Only S
- D and G only
- D and S only
- G and S only
- All three, D, G, and S.

Plus, the universal set includes all these, but since C is always present, the counts for D, G, S include C.

But the problem is that each resident owns at least one of D, G, S along with C. So, the total number of residents is the union of D, G, S, which is 900.

Wait, but D, G, S are subsets of C, which is the universal set. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900.

Now, the formula for the union of three sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

We know |D ∪ G ∪ S| is 900. The other terms are |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562.

But we also know that the number of people who own exactly two items is 437, and
