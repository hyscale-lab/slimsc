Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all of equal length, and all internal angles are equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles in a regular polygon is ((n-2)*180)/n, which here would be ((12-2)*180)/12 = 150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about finding rectangles inside this dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, I guess the sides of the rectangle are either the edges of the dodecagon or the diagonals connecting non-adjacent vertices.

I think the key here is to figure out how to choose four points (vertices) of the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. For a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the diagonals must be equal in length.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, not all diagonals are the same length. The diagonals can vary depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a regular polygon with n sides, the diagonals can be of different lengths based on the step between the vertices.

So, perhaps I need to figure out which sets of four points form rectangles by checking their positions. Let me think: in a regular polygon, a rectangle would require that the four points are such that the sides are parallel and equal in length. That probably means that the points are equally spaced around the polygon in some way.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, the number of sides is 12, which is even, so symmetry might play a big role here. Maybe the rectangles are formed by selecting pairs of vertices that are opposite each other, separated by a certain number of steps.

Let me recall that in a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the four vertices are symmetric with respect to the center. So, if I pick a vertex, then the vertex opposite to it, and two more vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center, then those four points should form a rectangle.

But wait, rectangles require that the sides are at right angles. In a regular dodecagon, the central angles between consecutive vertices are 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). So, for four points to form a rectangle, the angle between their sides should be 90 degrees.

Hmm, so the sides of the rectangle should be aligned in such a way that they correspond to chords of the dodecagon that are perpendicular to each other. That makes sense. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle correspond to chords that are of certain lengths, and their angles relative to each other are 90 degrees.

Let me try to visualize this. If I pick a vertex, say vertex A, then to form a rectangle, I need another vertex such that the chord between them is perpendicular to another chord. Wait, maybe I should think in
