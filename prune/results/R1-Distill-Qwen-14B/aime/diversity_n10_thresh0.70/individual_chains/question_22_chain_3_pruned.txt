Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of hexagons, especially equilateral ones with opposite sides parallel. I remember that such hexagons can be thought of as being "affine-regular," meaning they're similar to a regular hexagon but possibly stretched or skewed. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, it suggests that the hexagon might be a translated or scaled version of a regular one, but not necessarily regular in terms of angles.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF... I need to visualize this. If I extend these sides, they meet to form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. Wait, so the sides of this triangle are formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. That probably means these sides are the non-adjacent sides of the hexagon, each pair opposite each other.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side has the same length, say 's'. The opposite sides are parallel, which means that the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric figure. So, if I imagine the hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is both equal and parallel.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Let's label the hexagon ABCDEF, with AB opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. Wait, no, maybe I should double-check. No, wait: in a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. So for side AB, the opposite side is DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. Or is it? Wait, actually, in a hexagon, each side has an opposite side two steps away. So, AB is opposite to ED, BC opposite to FE, CD opposite to AF? Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite sides are AB opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. Wait, I think in a regular hexagon, each side is opposite the one three apart, but in a general convex
