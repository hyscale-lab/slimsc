Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't pass through its center. So, in this case, the torus T is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle.

The sphere S has a radius of 11. Now, the torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent along a circle, which gives me r_i, the radius of the inner tangent circle. Alternatively, the torus can rest outside the sphere and be tangent along another circle with radius r_o, the outer tangent radius. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about the geometry here. Both situations involve the torus being tangent to the sphere. I should probably model the torus mathematically and then find where it intersects the sphere.

First, let's recall that a torus can be represented in 3D coordinates with the equation: 

$(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2$

where R is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and r is the radius of the generating circle. In this problem, R is 6 and r is 3. So the equation of the torus T is:

$(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9$

Wait, no, actually, I think I might be mixing up the conventions. Let me check: when you rotate a circle of radius r around an axis at distance R from its center, the standard equation uses R as the major radius and r as the minor radius. So the equation should indeed be as above.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

When the torus rests inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. This means that at the point of tangency, both the torus and the sphere share a common tangent plane, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must satisfy some condition.

Wait, but where is the center of the torus? Hmm. The torus is generated by rotating a circle in a plane around an axis in that plane. So the center of the generating circle is at a distance R from the axis. So in the case of the torus, the center of the generating circle is at (R, 0, 0) if we position the axis along the z-axis. But in this problem, when the torus rests on the inside or outside of the sphere, its position relative to the sphere's center might change.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the sphere centered at the origin, and the torus can be placed such that its
