Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1, it must satisfy ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Maybe that will come in handy later.

The expression I need to compute is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm, each term in the product is a quadratic in ω^k. I wonder if I can factor this expression or relate it to something I know.

Wait, let me look at each term more closely. Let's rewrite 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of (1 - ω^k) or something similar.

Alternatively, since ω^k is a root of x¹³ - 1 = 0, perhaps I can express the product in terms of polynomials evaluated at ω^k. Let me think about this.

Let me denote z = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z². That's a quadratic in z. Let me compute this quadratic expression:

z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, that's equal to (z² - 2z + 1) + 1 = (z - 1)^2 + 1. So, each term is (z - 1)^2 + 1, where z = ω^k.

So, the product becomes:

∏_{k=0}^{12} [(ω^k - 1)^2 + 1]

Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable. So, I can write it as:

∏_{k=0}^{12} [(ω^k - 1)^2 + 1] = ∏_{k=0}^{12} [(ω^k - 1)^2 + 1]

Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term becomes (1 - 1)^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. So, the first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So, actually, the product is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of [(ω^k - 1)^2 + 1]. Because when k=0, it's 1
