Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially with an even number of sides, there can be a lot of symmetry, so maybe that can help me.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and each internal angle is the same. I know that in a regular n-gon, each internal angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. So for a dodecagon, that's (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. So each internal angle is 150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about finding rectangles. So a rectangle has four sides with four right angles. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles. I'm guessing that for a rectangle to be formed, the sides must be aligned such that their opposite sides are parallel and equal, and the angles between them are 90 degrees.

Wait, but how do the sides and diagonals of a dodecagon form right angles? Maybe by connecting certain vertices so that the lines are perpendicular. Let me think. Since the dodecagon is regular, it's inscribed in a circle, right? So all the vertices lie on a circle, and the sides and diagonals are chords of that circle.

In a regular polygon, the length of a chord depends on the number of sides it skips. For example, in a dodecagon, a side is a chord that connects adjacent vertices (skipping 0 sides). A diagonal that skips one vertex would be adjacent but not a side, and so on. Each chord corresponds to a certain central angle.

The central angle between two adjacent vertices in a dodecagon is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, the chord that skips k vertices has a central angle of 30*(k+1) degrees. For example, skipping 0 vertices is 30 degrees, skipping 1 vertex is 60 degrees, and so on, up to skipping 5 vertices, which would be 180 degrees, but that's just a straight line, so it's a diameter.

Wait, so to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by a certain number of skips. But the sides of the rectangle must lie on these chords. Also, the sides of the rectangle must be perpendicular, so their corresponding central angles must be such that the chords are perpendicular.

Hmm, so for two chords to be perpendicular, the sum of their central angles must be 90 degrees because in a circle, two chords are perpendicular if the sum of the angles they subtend at the center is 180 degrees? Wait, wait, no, I think it's a different condition. Let me recall: two chords are perpendicular if the sum of their subtended angles is 180 degrees. Wait, no, that's for when they meet at a point on the circumference. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here.

Alternatively, the dot product of the vectors representing the chords should be zero if they are perpendicular. Since all chords are from the center, each chord can be represented as a vector from the center to the vertex. So, if two chords (vectors) are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.

Let me think. Suppose I have two chords, each corresponding to a central angle θ1 and θ2. The vectors from the center will make angles θ1/2 and θ2/2 with their respective adjacent vertices. Wait, no. Actually, the central angle between two points is the angle at the center between them. So, for a chord that skips k vertices, the central angle is 30*(k+1) degrees. So, the vector representing that chord would make an angle of 15*(k+1) degrees from the next vertex.
