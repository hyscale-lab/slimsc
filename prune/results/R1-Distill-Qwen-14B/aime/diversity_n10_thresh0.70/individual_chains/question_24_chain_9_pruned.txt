Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. I'll take each condition one by one and see how they can help me figure out the list.

First, the sum is 30. That means if I add up all the numbers in the list, it equals 30. So the total is fixed, but the number of elements isn't specified yet. But mode and median will probably help with that.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently. Unique means no other number can have the same frequency as 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. Also, since it's the mode, it has to appear at least twice, right? Because if all numbers appear once, there wouldn't be a mode. So 9 appears more than any other number.

Third, the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the number of elements is odd, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, it's stated that the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, the median must be an integer, which implies that either there's an odd number of elements (so the middle one is an integer), or if even, the average of the two middle numbers is an integer. But in the case of even, the average being integer would require the two middle numbers to be either both even or both odd, so their sum is even, making the average integer.

But the median itself isn't in the list. So, for an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which shouldn't be present. But wait, in that case, how can the middle number not be present? Because the list includes all the numbers, so if the median is the middle number, it must be in the list. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Because then the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not be present in the list.

Let me clarify that: If the list has an even number of elements, say n, where n is even, then the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th terms. If these two terms are such that their average is an integer not present in the list, that could work.

So for example, if the two middle terms are 7 and 9, their average is 8, which isn't in the list. So that could fit. Alternatively, if the two middle terms are 8 and 8, the average is 8, which is in the list, so that wouldn't work because the median must not be in the list. Therefore, the two middle terms must sum to an even number, whose average is an integer not present in the list.

So, given all that, let's try to figure out the possible structure of the list.

First, the unique mode is 9, so 9 appears more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears k times. Then any other number can appear at most k-1 times.

Since the sum is 30, and the numbers are positive integers, let's think about how many 9s we can have.

Also, the median is not in the list. So, if the list has even number of elements, let's say 2m elements, the median is the average of the m-th and
