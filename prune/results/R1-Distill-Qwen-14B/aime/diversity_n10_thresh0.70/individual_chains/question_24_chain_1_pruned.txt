Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have a list of positive integers with certain properties. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says:

A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the sum is 30. That's straightforward. So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them all up, they should total 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number. Also, it's the only mode, so no other number can have the same frequency as 9.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Wait, but if the median is a positive integer and it's not in the list, that means the median is a number that isn't part of the list but falls in the middle when the list is sorted. Interesting.

I think the key here is to figure out the structure of the list. Let's start by considering the mode. Since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So I need to have multiple 9s in the list.

Let me think about the possible lengths of the list. Let's denote the number of elements as n. The median will depend on whether n is odd or even. If n is odd, the median is the middle element; if n is even, it's the average of the two middle elements. But in this case, the median is an integer that doesn't appear in the list. So if n is even, the median would be the average of two middle numbers, which must be an integer but not present in the list. If n is odd, the median is the middle number, which must be an integer not in the listâ€”wait, that's not possible because the median is the middle element, which is part of the list. So if n is odd, the median would be an element in the list, which contradicts the third condition. Therefore, n must be even.

So, the list has an even number of elements. Let me denote n as an even number, say 2k, where k is a positive integer. Then the median would be the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. And this average must be an integer not present in the list.

Let me think about the possible values of n. Since the sum is 30 and all elements are positive integers, the minimum possible n is 1 (but that would mean the list is just [30], but then the sum of squares would be 900, but let me check if it meets the mode condition. Wait, the mode is 9, so 9 must appear more than once. So n can't be 1. Hmm, the minimum n is 2 because for mode to exist, at least two elements are needed.

Wait, if n is 2, the list would have two numbers. The sum is 30, so the two numbers would be, say, a and b, a + b =30. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear more than once. But in a list of two numbers, both would have to be 9, but 9+9=18, which is less than 30. So n=2 is impossible.

Next, n=3. But wait, n has to be even because if n is odd, the median is in the list, which is not allowed. So n must be even. So n=4, 6, etc.

Let me start with the smallest possible even n, which is 4.

n=4: the list has four numbers. The sum is 30. The mode is 9, appearing more than any other number. So 9 must appear at least twice.

Let me think: the two middle numbers (since n is even) will determine the median. The median is the average of the second and third numbers. So I need that average to be an integer not present in the list.

Wait, the median is an integer, so the average of the second and third elements must be an integer. That means the sum of the second and third elements must be even. So their sum is even, so they are both even or both odd.

But the median is not in the list, so that integer (the average) should not be present in the list.

So
