Okay, so I came across this probability problem, and it's a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step. Let me try to walk through my thought process.

The problem is about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally, and vice versa. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a regular octagon, so it has eight sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each color having a 50% chance of being chosen. After coloring, we want to check if there's a rotation (like spinning the octagon by some multiple of 45 degrees, since 360/8 = 45) that will map all the blue vertices to the positions where there were originally red vertices and the red ones to where the blues were.

So, in other words, after coloring, we're looking for a rotation that flips the colors. That is, if we rotate the octagon by k positions (where k can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, because rotating by 8 would bring it back to the original position), then every blue vertex moves to a position that was red before the rotation, and every red vertex moves to a position that was blue before the rotation.

Hmm, okay. So, to rephrase, we need the coloring to be such that when we apply some rotation, the entire coloring pattern is inverted. That is, the coloring is symmetric under that rotation in a way that swaps red and blue.

This seems related to group theory and symmetries, but maybe I don't need to get too deep into that. Let me think about the possible rotations and how the colorings can be transformed.

First, let's consider the possible rotations. Since it's an octagon, the rotational symmetries are by multiples of 45 degrees, which correspond to shifting the vertices by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. The identity rotation (0 positions) doesn't change anything, so that's trivial. The other rotations are by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 positions. Each nontrivial rotation will shift each vertex to another position.

Now, for each possible rotation, we can check whether applying that rotation inverts the colors. The condition we want is that for some rotation k, the color of each vertex i after rotation is the opposite of its original color.

Let me formalize this a bit. Let the vertices be labeled 0 through 7. Letâ€™s say that after a rotation by k positions, vertex i moves to vertex (i + k) mod 8. Then, the color of vertex (i + k) mod 8 after rotation must be the opposite of the original color of vertex i.

So, for each vertex i, we have color[(i + k) mod 8] = opposite of color[i]. That means the coloring must satisfy color[(i + k) mod 8] = 1 - color[i] for all i, where we can represent colors as 0 (red) and 1 (blue) for simplicity.

Wait, but in the problem, the colors are red and blue, which are independent, each with probability 1/2. So, each color is assigned independently, but we're looking for colorings where such a rotation exists.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the coloring is "antisymmetric" with respect to some rotation. That is, the coloring is equal to its inverse under that rotation.

But perhaps another approach is to model this as a system of equations. For each rotation k, we can think of the requirement that color[(i + k) mod 8] = 1 - color[i] for all i. This would impose a set of constraints on the coloring.

Wait, but for each k, all these constraints must hold simultaneously. So, the coloring must satisfy that after shifting by k, all colors are flipped.

But to have such a coloring, it's necessary that the colorings are periodic with a certain period. For example, for k=1, the shift by one position, the coloring must be such that each color is the opposite of the previous one. So, the coloring would alternate red and blue. But in that case, the octagon would have a pattern like R, B, R, B, ..., but wait, that would only satisfy the condition for k=4, because shifting by 4 would reverse the colors. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, maybe not. Let me consider specific examples.

Case 1: k=0. That's the identity rotation, which doesn't change the coloring. So, the condition is that all blue vertices are where red ones were, which is only possible if all vertices are red and blue in the same positions after rotation, which is always true. But since the rotation is identity, the condition is trivially satisfied. But wait, the problem says "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, if we don't rotate at all, the blue vertices would have to coincide with the originally red ones. That would mean that the coloring is entirely red and blue, but the blues are exactly where the reds were, which can only happen if all vertices are red and all are blue, which is impossible. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let's read it again: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, before
