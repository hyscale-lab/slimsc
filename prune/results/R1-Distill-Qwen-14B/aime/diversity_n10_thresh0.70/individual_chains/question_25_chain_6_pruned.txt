Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and what they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, it's about sets and their intersections, right? So, we're dealing with some inclusion-exclusion principle here.

Alright, so let me list out the given information:

- Total residents: 900.
- Number owning a diamond ring (D): 195.
- Number owning a set of golf clubs (G): 367.
- Number owning a garden spade (S): 562.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C). Wait, so C is owned by all 900 residents? That's an important point.

Also, there's some info about exactly two and exactly three items:

- 437 own exactly two things.
- 234 own exactly three things.

And we need to find the number of people who own all four things, which is the intersection of D, G, S, and C.

Wait, but since everyone owns C, that means C is the universal set here. So, all the residents are in C. Therefore, when we're talking about intersections, it's actually the intersection with C as well, but since everyone has C, it's automatically included. Hmm, maybe that simplifies things a bit.

Let me think about how the inclusion-exclusion principle works for four sets. But wait, in this case, since C is owned by everyone, maybe we can treat it differently. Alternatively, since C is
