Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm. Let me break this down. I need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all three conditions and then compute the sum of their squares.

First, let's recall some definitions:

- The mode is the number that appears most frequently. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.
- The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. In this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, if the list has an even number of elements, the average of the two middle terms must be an integer not present in the list. If it's odd, then the middle number must be an integer not present in the list.

Also, all numbers are positive integers, so each number is at least 1.

Let me think about the structure of the list.

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if another number appears 'k' times, 9 must appear at least 'k+1' times.

Let me consider the possible lengths of the list. The sum is 30, so the number of elements can't be too large, because each element is at least 1. For example, the maximum number of elements is 30 (all ones), but obviously, with a mode of 9, it's impossible for all elements to be 1. So, the list must have a certain number of 9s and other numbers.

Let me denote:

Let n be the number of elements in the list.

We know that n must be such that the sum is 30. Also, the mode is 9, so 9 appears more frequently than any other number.

Let me think about possible n.

Let me consider n=5:

If n=5, then the median is the 3rd element when sorted. The sum is 30, so average is 6.

But 30 divided by 5 is 6, so the median is 6. But 6 must not appear in the list. But the list must sum to 30, and include multiple 9s as the mode.

Wait, let's see: If n=5, the median is the third number. Let me try to construct such a list.

Suppose the list is [a, b, 6, d, e], sorted. So, the median is 6, which is not in the list. So, 6 is the median but not present.

But wait, the list must have positive integers. So, a <= b <= 6 <= d <= e.

But since the median is 6, which is not in the list, then b must be less than 6, and d must be greater than 6.

Wait, but 6 is not in the list, so the two middle numbers must average to 6. So, for n even.

Wait, n is 5, which is odd, so the median is the middle number. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So, in the case of n=5, the third number must be an integer not present in the list.

Wait, but in that case, how is that possible? Because in a sorted list of 5 elements, the third one is the median. So, if the median is not present in the list, that would mean that
