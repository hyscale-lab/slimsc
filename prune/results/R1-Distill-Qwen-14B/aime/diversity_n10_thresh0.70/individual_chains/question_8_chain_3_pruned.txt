Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. We're dealing with three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers. The first equation is linear, and the second one is a bit more complicated—it's a symmetric expression involving squares and products.

Maybe I can rewrite the second equation in a more manageable way. Let's see: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is of the form x²y where x and y are a, b, or c. Also, each pair of variables appears exactly once. So, for example, we have a²b and a²c, which are the terms involving a squared with b and c. Similarly for b²a and b²c, and c²a and c²b.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try factoring:

Looking at a²b + a²c, I can factor out a², so that's a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c would be b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So the entire expression can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Which simplifies to:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that's the same as I had before. Maybe I can factor this further. Alternatively, perhaps I can express it in terms of (a + b + c). Since a + b + c = 300, maybe that substitution will help.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300. Then, for each term like (b + c), that's equal to S - a. Similarly, (a + c) = S - b, and (a + b) = S - c.

So substituting these into the expression:

a²(S - a) + b²(S - b) + c²(S - c)

Expanding each term:

= a²S - a³ + b²S - b³ + c²S - c³

Factor S out:

= S(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

So the second equation becomes:

S(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

But since S = 300, substitute that in:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, so now we have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I wonder if this can be expressed in terms of another symmetric expression. Let me think about how to manipulate this.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums. I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be written as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc. So perhaps I can use that identity.

Let me write that down:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc

Substituting S = 300, this becomes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc

Now, going back to the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Let me compute each part step by step. First, compute 300³:

300³ = 300 * 300 * 300 = 27,000,000

So, substituting that in:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Let me distribute the negative sign:

300(a² + b² + c²) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Bring the 27,000,000 to the other side by adding 27,000,000 to both sides:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc =
