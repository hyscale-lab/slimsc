Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, I know that moving from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid means moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, in some order. So each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths would be the combination C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have the additional condition that the path changes direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? I think each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, a path that goes R R R U U U would have two direction changes: after the third R to the first U, and then maybe another change if it switches back, but in this case, it doesn't.

Let me think, how many direction changes can a path have? Well, each time the direction changes, you're switching between R and U. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the path switches from R to U or U to R. If a path starts with R, then each time it switches to U, that's a direction change, and then each switch back to R is another.

So, the maximum number of direction changes in a path is 15, but in reality, it depends on how the steps are arranged. But in this case, the problem says exactly four direction changes. So, the path alternates between R and U exactly four times, meaning it has five segments of consecutive R's or U's. Wait, because each direction change marks the start of a new segment. So, four changes would split the path into five segments.

Wait, let's think about that more carefully. Suppose the path starts with R, then changes to U, then back to R, and so on. Each change is a switch. So, four changes would result in five segments. So, the number of segments is one more than the number of direction changes. So, if there are four direction changes, the path consists of five straight segments, alternating between R and U.

Now, since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), it must have a total of 8 R moves and 8 U moves. So, each path is a sequence of R's and U's adding up to 16 moves, with exactly four direction changes, which means it has five segments.

Let me model this. Suppose the path starts with R. Then the sequence of segments would be R, U, R, U, R (if four changes, that's five segments). Alternatively, it might start with U, so U, R, U, R, U. So, the starting direction can be either R or U.

Wait, but given that the grid is symmetric, maybe I can compute the number of paths starting with R and then double it, but I need to confirm
