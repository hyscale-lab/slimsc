Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. So, Alice picks some set A, and Bob is creating a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of each B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. My goal is to find the sum of the elements in A.

First, maybe I should figure out how the number of sets B relates to the set A. Let's denote A as a set containing some positive integers. For each element a in A, I think that Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum element. Then, the number of such sets B for each a would be the number of subsets of the positive integers less than a, because any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} combined with {a} would form a set B where a is the maximum.

Wait, so for each a in A, the number of possible B sets where a is the max is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}. Since each subset can be combined with {a} to form such a B. And since subsets include the empty set as well, the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1}, right? Because the number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n.

So, for each a in A, the number of B sets where a is the maximum is 2^{a-1}. Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob has is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

But wait, in the problem, Bob is listing all finite non-empty sets B where max(B) is in A. So, each B is a finite non-empty set, but A could be any set. So, for each a in A, the number of B's with max(B) = a is 2^{a-1}, as the subsets of {1,2,...,a-1} can be combined with a.

So, if A is {a1, a2, ..., an}, the total number of B's is 2^{a1-1} + 2^{a2-1} + ... + 2^{an-1}.

In the problem, this total is 2024. So, we have the equation:

sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of elements in A, which is sum_{a in A} a.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024. Then, sum the a's.

So, I need to find a set A where the sum is 2024, and then compute sum A.

Now, perhaps I can think of 2024 in binary, since 2^{a-1} are powers of two. Maybe A corresponds to the positions of 1's in the binary representation of 2024.

Let me compute the binary representation of 2024.

First, divide 2024 by 2: 2024 ÷ 2 = 1012, remainder 0
1012 ÷ 2 = 506, rem 0
506 ÷2=253 rem 0
253 ÷2=126 rem 1
126 ÷2=63 rem 0
63 ÷2=31 rem 1
31 ÷2=15 rem 1
15 ÷2=7 rem 1
7 ÷2=3 rem 1
3 ÷2=1 rem 1
