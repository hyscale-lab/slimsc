Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \(z\) with magnitude 4 can be written as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). That's because the magnitude is 4, so in polar form, the magnitude is 4, and the angle can vary. Alternatively, \(z\) could also be expressed as \(4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\). Either way, the magnitude is fixed, but the angle can change, which affects the real and imaginary parts.

So, let me write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). That makes sense. Then, the reciprocal \(1/z\) would be \(\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\), because \(1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2\), and since \(|z| = 4\), it's \(1/4\) times the conjugate of \(z\), which is \(e^{-i\theta}\) in exponential form.

Substituting these into the expression, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute \((75 + 117i)z\):

\[
(75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}
\]

Similarly, compute \(\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\):

\[
\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

So, the entire expression becomes:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Now, I can factor out the constants:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} = 4 \times (75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} = [4 \times 75 + 4 \times 117i] e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}
\]

Similarly, for the second term:

\[
\frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} = [24 + 36i] e^{-i\theta}
\]

So, combining both terms:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Now, let me express each complex number in terms of their real and imaginary parts multiplied by \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\). Remembering Euler's formula, \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\), and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\).

So, let's expand the first term:

\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this becomes:

\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
\]

Similarly, the second term:

\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta
\]

Again, \(i^2 = -1\), so:

\[
24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
\]

Now, let's combine all the terms from both expansions.

First, collect the real parts:

1. From the first expansion: \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)
2. From the second expansion: \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Adding them together:

\[
(300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta) + (-468\sin\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

Now, collect the imaginary parts:

1. From the first expansion: \(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta\)
2. From the second expansion: \(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta\)

Adding them together:

\[
(300\sin\theta - 24\sin\theta) + (468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta) = 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta
\]

So, the entire expression is:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)
\]

But the problem asks for the real part of this expression, which is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). So, we need to find the maximum value of this real part as \(\theta\) varies.

Let me denote the real part as:

\[
R(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

I know that the maximum value of an expression of the form \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). But wait, in our case, it's \(a\cos\theta - b\sin\theta\), which is similar. The formula still holds because the sign of \(b\) can be incorporated into the angle.

So, the maximum value of \(R(\theta)\) would be \(\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \(324^2\):

324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90,000. Then, 24^2 = 576. Then, cross term 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, compute 432^2:

432 is 400 + 32. So, 400^2 = 160,000; 32^2 = 1,024; cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, 324^2 + 432^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

Therefore, the square root of 291,600 is the maximum real part.

Compute sqrt(291,600). Let me see: 500^2 = 250,000; 600^2=360,000. So, it's between 500 and 600.

540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. Oh! So, sqrt(291,600) = 540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure. Because R(theta) is 324 cos(theta) - 432 sin(theta). The maximum is the amplitude, which is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Since the coefficients are 324 and -432, the maximum is indeed sqrt(324² + (432)^2) = 540. So, that's the maximum value of the real part.

Hence, the largest possible real part is 540.

But wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, so I had:

Expression = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z|=4.

I set z = 4 e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Expanding both terms, I had:

First term: 4*(75 +
