Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but a certain distance away from the center. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. The problem says that when the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about the internal tangent first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's surface touches the torus along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere touches it along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles.

I remember that for two surfaces tangent to each other, the points of tangency lie along a circle whose radius can be found using the distance between the centers minus the radii of the surfaces involved. But wait, the torus is a bit more complicated because it's a surface of revolution. Maybe I should model this in 3D coordinates.

Let me try to set up a coordinate system. Let's place the center of the sphere S at the origin (0,0,0). The torus T has its center at (h,0,0), but wait, when it's resting on the inside or outside, the center might be offset differently.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus in terms of its major and minor radii. The torus can be described parametrically. Let me recall the parametric equations for a torus.

The standard torus is given by:
x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

Where R is the major radius, r is the minor radius, θ and φ are angles.

In this problem, R is 6 (distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) and r is 3 (radius of the generating circle). So, R=6, r=3.

Now, the sphere S has radius 11, centered at the origin.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the distance from the origin to the center of the torus must be such that the closest point on the torus touches the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the farthest point on the torus touches the sphere.

Wait, no. Actually, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. The sphere's surface just
