Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Jen is entering a lottery. She picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones.

The question is about conditional probability. It asks for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so I need to find P(grand prize | prize). By definition of conditional probability, this is equal to P(grand prize and prize) / P(prize). But wait, if she won the grand prize, she must have won a prize as well, because the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So P(grand prize and prize) is just P(grand prize). Therefore, the conditional probability is P(grand prize) / P(prize).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that she wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize (which includes both the grand prize and the cases where she matches exactly two or three numbers).

Let me structure this:

1. Compute P(grand prize): the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen.
2. Compute P(prize): the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen.

Then, the required probability is P(grand prize) / P(prize).

First, let's compute P(grand prize). The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1, because Jen has picked a specific set of four numbers, and the lottery also picks those same four. So,

P(grand prize) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, actually, let me confirm. The total number of possible lottery draws is C(10,4). The number of favorable for the grand prize is 1, since only her specific set is the winning one. So yes, P(grand prize) = 1 / C(10,4).

Compute C(10,4). 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So P(grand prize) is 1/210.

Now, moving on to P(prize). This is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, this includes the cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen. Alternatively, since the probability of at least two is 1 minus the probability of zero or one matches.

But I think it might be easier to compute it directly by summing the probabilities of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four matches.

Wait, but in this problem, the prize is given for at least two matches. So, the prize is won if she has exactly two, three, or four matches. So P(prize) is the sum of probabilities of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four matches.

Alternatively, since we can compute 1 - P(no prize), where P(no prize) is the probability that fewer than two numbers match, i.e., zero or one match. Maybe that's easier. Let me think.

But since the numbers are small, perhaps computing each case is manageable.

Let me proceed with both methods to see which is easier.

Method 1: Compute P(prize) = P(exactly 2) + P(exactly 3) + P(exactly 4)

Method 2: Compute P(prize) = 1 - [P(0) + P(1)]

I think both are feasible. Let me try both.

First, let's get the total number of possible lottery draws, which is C(10,4) = 210.

Compute P(exactly k matches) for k=0,1,2,3,4.

The number of ways to choose exactly k of Jen's numbers and (4 - k) from the remaining numbers.

Jen has 4 numbers. The total set has 10 numbers, so the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6.

So, for exactly k matches:

Number of favorable outcomes = C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k)

Because we choose k numbers from Jen's 4 and (4 - k) numbers from the other 6.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly k matches is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).

So, the probability P(k) is [C(4,k) * C(6,4 -k)] / C(10,4).

So, let's compute each term.

Compute for k=0: [C(4,0)*C(6,4)] / 210.

C(4,0) = 1, C(6,4) = 15. So 1*15=15. So P(0) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Similarly, k=1: [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / 210.

C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20. So 4*20=80. P(1)=80/210=8/21.

k=2: [C(4,2)*C(6,2)].

C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. So 6*15=90. P(2)=90/210=3/7.

k=3: [C(4,3)*C(6,1)].

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So 4*6=24. P(3)=24/210=4/35.

k=4: [C(4,4)*C(6,0)]=1*1=1. P(4)=1/210.

Let me check if these probabilities sum to 1.
