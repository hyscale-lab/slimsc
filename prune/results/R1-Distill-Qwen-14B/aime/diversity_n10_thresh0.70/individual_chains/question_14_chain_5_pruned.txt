Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with this specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Interesting.

So, for example, if N is abcd (each letter representing a digit), then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, which must also be divisible by 7. Same for c and d: changing them to 1 gives ab1d and abc1, respectively, and both must be divisible by 7. So all four of these modified numbers are divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest N that satisfies this condition. Once we have N, we need to compute Q = N // 1000 (the quotient when divided by 1000, which is essentially the first digit, since N is four digits) and R = N % 1000 (the last three digits). Then, add Q and R together.

So, first, I need to figure out what N is. Let's break down the problem.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits, with a ≠ 0.

The conditions given are:

1. When we replace a with 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This number must be divisible by 7.

2. When we replace b with 1, the number becomes 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

3. When we replace c with 1, the number becomes 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. This must be divisible by 7.

4. When we replace d with 1, the number becomes 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. This must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four modified numbers must be ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me write each condition in modular arithmetic terms.

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm. So four congruence relations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express these in terms of N. Let me think.

Wait, N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When we replace a with 1, the number becomes 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let me denote this as N1.

Similarly, replacing b with 1 gives N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d.

Replacing c with 1 gives N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d.

Replacing d with 1 gives N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

Let me see if I can express these in terms of N.

Let me compute N1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

But N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

So N1 = 1000(1) + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + (100b + 10c + d).

But 100b + 10c + d is equal to N - 1000a.

So N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000a) = N - 1000a + 1000.

Similarly, N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d.

Which is equal to 1000a + 100 + (10c + d) = 100*(10a + 1) + (10c + d).

But 10c + d is N's last two digits. Alternatively, since N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, then N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = N - 100b + 100.

Wait, maybe another approach: N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - 100b + 100 = N - 100b + 100.

Similarly, N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - 10c + 10 = N - 10c + 10.

And N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - d + 1 = N - d + 1.

So, in terms of N:

N1 = N - 1000a + 1000.

N2 = N - 100b + 100.

N3 = N - 10c + 10.

N4 = N - d + 1.

Each of these must be ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, writing this as:

1. N - 1000a + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. N - 100b + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. N - 10c + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. N - d + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm, so each of these expressions is congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Alternatively, we can write:

1. N ≡ 1000a - 1000 mod 7.

2. N ≡ 100b - 100 mod 7.

3. N ≡ 10c - 10 mod 7.

4. N ≡ d - 1 mod 7.

Wait, perhaps I can compute each of these mod 7 to simplify.

First, let's compute the coefficients mod 7, because 1000, 100, 10, etc., have known mod 7 residues.

Let me compute 10^k mod 7 for k=0,1,2,3.

10^0 mod7 = 1

10^1 mod7 = 3 (since 10/7=1 rem 3)

10^2 mod7 = 3*10 mod7 = 30 mod7=30-28=2.

10^3 mod7 = 2*10 mod7=20 mod7=6.

So, 10^k mod7:

k | mod7
0 | 1
1 | 3
2 | 2
3 | 6

So, for a four-digit number N = a b c d, N mod7 can be calculated as:

N mod7 = (a * 1000 + b * 100 + c * 10 + d) mod7.

Which, using the above, is (a*6 + b*2 + c*3 + d*1) mod7.

So, N mod7 = (6a + 2b + 3c + d) mod7.

Similarly, let's compute the coefficients in the four conditions.

1. N ≡ 1000a - 1000 mod7.

Compute 1000 mod7. Since 1000 = 10^3, which is 6 mod7, as above. So 1000a mod7 = 6a.

Similarly, 1000 mod7 =6. So 1000a -1000 mod7 is (6a -6) mod7.

So condition 1: N ≡ (6a -6) mod7.

Similarly, condition 2:

N ≡ 100b -100 mod7.

100 mod7 is 2. So 100b mod7=2b. 100 mod7=2. So 100b -100 mod7 = (2b -2) mod7.

Condition 2: N ≡ (2b -2) mod7.

Condition 3:

N ≡ 10c -10 mod7.

10 mod7=3. So 10c mod7=3c. 10 mod7=3. So 10c -10 mod7= (3c -3) mod7.

Condition3: N ≡ (3c -3) mod7.

Condition4:

N ≡ d -1 mod7.

So condition4: N ≡ (d -1) mod7.

So, summarizing:

1. N ≡ (6a -6) mod7.

2. N ≡ (2b -2) mod7.

3. N ≡ (3c -3) mod7.

4. N ≡ (d -1) mod7.

But N mod7 can also be expressed in terms of its digits as N mod7 = (6a + 2b + 3c + d) mod7.

So equate this to each of the above.

So:

1. (6a + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ (6a -6) mod7.

2. (6a + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ (2b -2) mod7.

3. (6a + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ (3c -3) mod7.

4. (6a + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ (d -1) mod7.

Let me write each of these congruences.

1. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 6a -6 mod7.

Subtract 6a from both sides: 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7.

But -6 mod7 is 1, since 7-6=1. So:

2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7. Equation (1)

2. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 2b -2 mod7.

Subtract 2b: 6a +3c + d ≡ -2 mod7.

-2 mod7=5, so:

6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7. Equation (2)

3. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡3c -3 mod7.

Subtract 3c: 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod7.

-3 mod7=4, so:

6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7. Equation (3)

4. 6a +2b +3c +d ≡d -1 mod7.

Subtract d: 6a +2b +3c ≡ -1 mod7.

-1 mod7=6,
