Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. And N is the greatest such number with the specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.

Let me break this down. Suppose N is represented as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

The condition is that if we change any one digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q + R, where Q = N / 1000 (integer division) and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

So, first, I need to find N. Let me think about how to approach this.

I think I should represent N as ABCD, and for each digit, when replaced by 1, the number becomes a multiple of 7. So, we can write four equations:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me express each of these numerically.

1. 1BCD is equal to 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7, so:

1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly for the others:

2. A1CD is 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. So,

1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. AB1D is 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. So,

1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. ABC1 is 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. So,

1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So these are four modular equations that N must satisfy. But N is ABCD, so N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

I think we can write each of these four equations in terms of N. Let me try that.

For the first equation: 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

But N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, 1000A + 100B + 10C + D = N.

So, 1000 + (N - 1000A) = 1000 + N - 1000A.

Wait, that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps express each modified number in terms of N.

Wait, 1BCD can be written as 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, 1BCD = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

Similarly, A1CD = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = (N - 0) + (100 - 100B) ?

Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, for each modified number, I can find the difference from N and express the condition accordingly.

Let me denote the four modified numbers as:

M1: Change first digit to 1: 1BCD.

M2: Change second digit to 1: A1CD.

M3: Change third digit to 1: AB1D.

M4: Change fourth digit to 1: ABC1.

Each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, M1 = 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, M2 = A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

M3 = AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

M4 = ABC1 = 10
