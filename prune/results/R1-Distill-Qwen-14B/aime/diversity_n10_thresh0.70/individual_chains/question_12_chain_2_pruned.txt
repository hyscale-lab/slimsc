Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me. It says I need to find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. There's an example given, which I should probably look at to make sure I understand.

The example grid is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

And the explanation is that 0 + 991 = 991, but wait, that's not 999. Hmm, maybe I misread. Oh, no, wait. Reading left to right, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999. Got it. And reading top to bottom, each column is 09, 09, and 81. So 09 + 09 + 81 = 99. Oh, right, because each column is a two-digit number? Wait, no, columns are each two digits. So the first column is 0 and 9, which would be 09, the second is 0 and 9, which is 09, and the third is 8 and 1, which is 81. Then 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Wait, no, 09 is 9, right? So 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Yeah, that adds up.

So the grid is structured as follows:

Top row: a, b, c

Bottom row: d, e, f

So when reading left to right, the first number is abc (a three-digit number, but if a is 0, it's effectively a two-digit or one-digit number) and the second number is def. Their sum should be 999.

When reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number: ad, be, cf. Their sum should be 99.

Wait, no, the problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom." So each column is read top to bottom, which would be a two-digit number for each column. So, the three numbers are ad, be, cf. Their sum is 99.

Wait, but in the example, the numbers are 09, 09, 81, which are 9, 9, and 81. So 9 + 9 +81=99. So yeah, each column is a two-digit number, and their sum is 99.

So the problem is to fill the grid with digits such that:

1. The number from the top row (abc) plus the number from the bottom row (def) equals 999.

2. Each column's two
