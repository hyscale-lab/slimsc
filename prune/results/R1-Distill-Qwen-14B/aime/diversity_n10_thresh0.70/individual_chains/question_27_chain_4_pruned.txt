Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. 

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, if I imagine this, the torus has a major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) of 6, and a minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) of 3. So, it's like a donut with a bigger hole (since major radius is 6 and minor radius is 3). 

Then, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem is talking about T resting on the inside and outside of S, and in each case, they are tangent along a circle. The radii of these circles are r_i (internal tangent) and r_o (external tangent). We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to model this. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus rests inside it, touching along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's resting on the sphere, so the sphere is inside the torus, touching along another circle.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, the centers of their generating circles must lie along the same line, which is the axis of revolution for both. But wait, the torus is already a surface of revolution. So when it's tangent to the sphere, the sphere must also be symmetric with respect to the same axis. That makes sense because both are surfaces of revolution around that axis.

So, maybe I can model this by considering cross-sectional views. Since both are surfaces of revolution, their intersections and tangent points can be analyzed in 2D.

Let me try to visualize the cross-section: the torus would look like two circles (since a torus' cross-section is two circles), and the sphere would look like a circle in this cross-sectional view. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere will touch the inner part of the torus, and when it's outside, it'll touch the outer part.

Wait, but actually, in cross-section, a torus is two circles. So, when we have the torus inside the sphere, the sphere will enclose the torus, and they'll be tangent at the inner equator of the torus, I think. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere will be inside the torus, and tangent at the outer equator.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of equations.

Let me recall the equation of a torus in 3D. The standard torus can be represented as:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

where R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius. In our case, R = 6, r = 3.

So the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 3² = 9

And the sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent. Similarly, when it's outside, they are tangent. Wait, no. Actually, when T is inside S, it's internally tangent; when T is outside S, it's externally tangent. So we have two cases.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and sphere are tangent. At these points, their surfaces touch, so their normals must be equal, and their gradients must be colinear. Alternatively, since both are surfaces of revolution, their tangent circle lies in a plane that includes the axis of revolution. So
