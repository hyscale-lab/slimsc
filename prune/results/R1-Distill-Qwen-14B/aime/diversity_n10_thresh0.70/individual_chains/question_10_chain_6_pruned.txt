Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A."

Hmm, so Alice picks some set A, which contains positive integers. Then Bob creates a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the max element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024, and we need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me try to understand what Bob is doing. For each set B, the maximum element must be in A. So, for example, if A is {1, 2, 3}, then any finite non-empty set B where the largest number is 1, 2, or 3 would be included in Bob's list.

Wait, but how does Bob count these sets? For each element a in A, how many finite non-empty sets B have max(B) = a? Then Bob's total number of sets would be the sum over each a in A of the number of such sets B for that a.

Right, for each a in A, the number of finite non-empty sets B where max(B) = a is equal to 2^{a-1}. Because, for each a, the sets B can include any combination of the numbers from 1 to a-1, along with a itself. So for each a, the number of such sets is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, let me think about that. For example, if a=1, then the only set is {1}, so that's 1 set, which is 2^{0}=1. If a=2, then the possible sets are {2}, {1,2}, so that's 2 sets, which is 2^{1}=2. For a=3, the sets are {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}, which is 4 sets, which is 2^{2}=4. Yep, that seems right.

So, if A has elements {a1, a2, ..., an}, then the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum from i=1 to n of 2^{ai - 1}. And according to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So, we have the equation:

2^{a1 - 1} + 2^{a2 - 1} + ... + 2^{an - 1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum a1 + a2 + ... + an.

Hmm, so we need a set A where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024. Let me think about how to approach this.

Since 2024 is a specific number, perhaps we can express it as a sum of powers of 2. Because each term in the sum is 2^{k}, where k is one less than an element of A.

Wait, but 2024 is equal to
