Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. It's the greatest such number, meaning I probably need to start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is abcd (digits a, b, c, d), then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives ab1d. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Wait, actually, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, for N, every possible single-digit replacement with 1 must result in a multiple of 7.

I think the approach here is to find the largest four-digit number N such that each of these four modified numbers is divisible by 7.

So, perhaps I can model this with some equations. Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits, and a ≠ 0.

Now, when we replace each digit with 1, we get four numbers:

1. Replace a with 1: M1 = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d
2. Replace b with 1: M2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d
3. Replace c with 1: M3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d
4. Replace d with 1: M4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these M1, M2, M3, M4 must be divisible by 7.

So, M1 ≡ 0 mod 7,

M2 ≡ 0 mod 7,

M3 ≡ 0 mod 7,

M4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

I can write each of these congruence conditions:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, maybe I can compute each coefficient modulo 7 to simplify these congruences.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

7 × 142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 → 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 ÷ 7: 7×14=98, so 100 - 98 = 2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ÷ 7 is 1 with remainder 3 → 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

1 mod 7 is obviously 1.

So, substituting:

1. M1 = 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2. M2 = 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3. M3 = 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4. M4 = 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, that's four equations:

Equation 1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Now, I have four congruences with variables a, b, c, d.

I need to find a, b, c, d which satisfy all four.

Since N is the largest possible four-digit number, I should start with a=9, and try to find b, c, d, but perhaps I can find relations between the equations.

Let me see if I can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1:

(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) = (6a + 2 -6 -2b) = 6a -2b -4 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, 6a - 2b -4 ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify: Let's factor 2: 2(3a - b -2) ≡ 0 mod 7

Since 2 and 7 are coprime, this implies 3a - b -2 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, 3a - b ≡ 2 mod 7 → Equation 5

Similarly, let's subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 3:

(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6a + 2b + 3 + d) = (2 -3) + ( -2b) = -1 -2b ≡ 0 mod 7

So, -2b -1 ≡ 0 mod7 → -2b ≡1 mod7 → Multiply both sides by -1: 2b ≡ -1 ≡6 mod7

So, 2b ≡6 mod7 → Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4 because 2×4=8≡1 mod7.

So, b ≡6×4=24≡3 mod7.

So, b ≡3 mod7. Since b is a digit (0-9), possible values for b are 3 and 10, but 10 is not a digit, so b=3.

So, b=3.

Now, from Equation 5: 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Since b=3, 3a -3 ≡2 mod7 → 3a ≡5 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7. 3×5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 5.

Thus, a ≡5×5=25≡4 mod7.

So, a ≡4 mod7. Since a is a digit from 1-9, possible a's are 4 and 11, but 11 is invalid, so a=4.

Wait, but wait a second. N is the greatest four-digit number, so a should be as large as possible. If a is 4, but wait, 4 is less than 9, which contradicts our goal to find the largest N.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Because if I set a=9, but then from Equation 5, 3a -3 ≡2 mod7, that would mean 3×9 -3=27-3=24≡3 mod7. But we have 3a -3 ≡2 mod7, so 24≡3 mod7, which is not equal to 2. So that suggests that a=9 is not acceptable.

Wait, but I started with a=9, but perhaps that's not the case. Maybe a=4 is the only solution?

Wait, perhaps I'm choosing a wrong approach. Let me think again.

Wait, when I subtracted Equation 2 minus Equation 1, I got 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

But if a can be from 1-9, and b must be 3, perhaps I can find a that satisfies 3a ≡5 mod7, which is 3a mod7=5.

So, 3a ≡5 mod7: Let's see possible a's.

a=4: 3×4=12≡5 mod7 → yes, that works.

a=4+7=11, which is invalid as a digit. So only a=4.

So, a must be 4.

Wait, but that seems to conflict with the problem's requirement to find the greatest four-digit number. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is wrong because I subtracted equations and forced a=4, but that might not be the case. Let me check my
