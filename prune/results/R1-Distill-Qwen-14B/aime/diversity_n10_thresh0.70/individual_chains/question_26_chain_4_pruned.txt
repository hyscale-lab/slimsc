Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC, which is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The sides AB, BC, and AC are given as 5, 9, and 10 respectively. I need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I should probably sketch the problem to visualize it better. But since I don't have paper right now, I'll try to imagine it. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something? Maybe D is the exsimilicenter or something related to the tangents. 

I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole, and in this case, since the tangents are at B and C, D is the ex-pole with respect to BC. Hmm. Also, AD intersects ω again at P. So I need to find AP.

I think I can use power of a point here. The power of point D with respect to ω. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, the power of D is equal to DB² = DC² because the lengths of the two tangents from D to ω are equal. So DB = DC.

Wait, that's right. The two tangent segments from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So DB = DC. That might come in handy.

My goal is to find AP, so perhaps I can express AP in terms of other lengths in the triangle. I also remember that when a line from a point intersects a circle, the power of the point can relate the segments. So maybe I can use the power of point A with respect to some circle, but actually, A is on ω, so its power is zero. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem. Or maybe harmonic division properties? Or maybe using similar triangles.

Wait, another thought: since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then BD is the tangent at B, and CD is the tangent at C. So, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle because DB = DC. So, triangle DBC is isosceles with DB = DC.

Let me try to compute some lengths. Maybe I can find the length of DB and DC first.

But to find DB, I might need to find the circumradius of triangle ABC first. Because the length of the tangent from D to ω is DB = DC = sqrt(DO² - R²), where O is the center of ω. Wait, but I don't know O's location or the radius R yet.

Alternatively, since I know the sides of triangle ABC, I can compute its area using Heron's formula, then find its circumradius R. Then, perhaps, I can find the distance from D to O or something.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC first. The sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The semi-perimeter s is (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, the area using Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504]. Let's compute that: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, wait, 504 is 16*31.5? No, 16*31.5 is 504? Wait, 16*31 is 496, plus 16*0.5 is 8, so 504. So sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Hmm, but 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2) = (3*sqrt(14))/sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(28))/2. Wait, maybe I can factor 504 differently.

Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Maybe a better factorization. Let's see: 504 divided
