Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway to (1,0), and B is on the y-axis at a point higher than (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Then, there's a family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, PQ is a line segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1.

So, for any such segment PQ, we have sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, since they're on the axes and it's the distance between (p,0) and (0,q). So, p² + q² = 1.

Now, the family F consists of all such segments PQ with unit length in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem is about a point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, C is a point on AB. The claim is that there's a unique such point C on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F.

We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. The answer will be a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and we need to find p + q.

So, the plan is to first find the equation of line AB because point C is on AB. Then, we need to find the point C on AB that is only intersected by PQ when PQ is exactly AB itself, and not by any other PQ in the family F.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about all the possible segments PQ in F and find their envelope or something, and then find the point C where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because if C is only on AB and no other PQ, then AB is tangent to the envelope at C.

Hmm, that might be the right approach. So, let's try to model the family F of lines PQ.

Each PQ connects (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1. So, the equation of PQ can be written in intercept form: x/p + y/q = 1.

But since p² + q² = 1, we can parameterize p and q. Maybe use an angle theta, such that p = cos(theta) and q = sin(theta), but wait, no, because p and q are lengths on the axes, so p and q are positive, but in our case, p² + q² = 1, so p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta) for theta in [0, pi/2].

Wait, but in our case, the segment PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q), and it's of unit length. So, p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1. So, the equation of line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, for each theta between 0 and pi/2, we can write p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), and then the equation of PQ is x/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) = 1.

So, the family of lines is given by (x)/cos(theta) + (y)/sin(theta) = 1, where theta is in (0, pi/2).

This is a standard family of lines. The envelope of this family is the curve that is tangent to each member of the family. So, to find the envelope, we can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves.

The envelope is found by solving the system:

F(x,y,theta) = x/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) - 1 = 0

and

dF/dtheta = 0.

So, compute dF/dtheta and set it to zero.

Compute dF/dtheta:

d/dtheta [x/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) -1] = x sin(theta)/cos²(theta) - y cos(theta)/sin²(theta).

So,

x sin(theta)/cos²(theta) - y cos(theta)/sin²(theta) = 0.

Let me write that as:

x sin(theta)/cos²(theta) = y cos(theta)/sin²(theta)

Multiply both sides by cos²(theta) sin²(theta):

x sin^3(theta) = y cos^3(theta)

So,

x sin^3(theta) = y cos^3(theta)

=> (x/y) = (cos^3(theta)/sin^3(theta)) = (cot(theta))^3

So,

cot(theta) = (x/y)^(1/3)

Wait, but perhaps we can express sin(theta) and cos(theta) in terms of x and y.

Alternatively, let's solve for sin(theta) and cos(theta):

From F(x,y,theta)=0: x/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) =1

From dF/dtheta=0: x sin(theta)/cos²(theta) = y cos(theta)/sin²(theta)

Let me denote t = theta for simplicity.

So,

Equation 1: x / cos(t) + y / sin(t) = 1

Equation 2: x sin(t)/cos²(t) = y cos(t)/sin²(t)

Let me write Equation 2 as:

x sin^3(t) = y cos^3(t)

So,

x = y (cos^3(t)/sin^3(t)) = y (cot(t))^3

So, let's denote k = cot(t), so x = y k^3.

But from Equation 1:

x / cos(t) + y / sin(t) = 1

Substitute x = y k^3,

(y k^3)/cos(t) + y / sin(t) = 1

But k = cot(t) = cos(t)/sin(t), so k^3 = cos^3(t)/sin^3(t)

So,

y (cos^3(t)/sin^3(t)) / cos(t) + y / sin(t) = 1

Simplify:

y (cos²(t)/sin^3(t)) + y / sin(t) =1

Factor y / sin(t):

y / sin(t) [ cos²(t)/sin²(t) + 1 ] = 1

Wait, cos²(t)/sin²(t) is cot²(t) = k²

So,

y / sin(t) [ k² + 1 ] = 1

But k = cot(t), so k = cos(t)/sin(t)

So,

y / sin(t) [ (cos²(t)/sin²(t)) + 1 ] = 1

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach.

From Equation 2:

x sin^3(t) = y cos^3(t)

=> x = y (cos^3(t)/sin^3(t))

Let me express this as x = y (cos t / sin t)^3 = y (cot t)^3

Let me denote m = cot t, so x = y m^3

Then, plug into Equation 1:

x / cos t + y / sin t = 1

Substitute x = y m^3,

(y m^3)/cos t + y / sin t = 1

But m = cot t = cos t / sin t

So, m^3 = cos^3 t / sin^3 t

So,

(y cos^3 t / sin^3 t)/cos t + y / sin t = 1

Simplify:

y cos² t / sin^3 t + y / sin t =1

Factor y / sin t:

y / sin t [ cos² t / sin² t + 1 ] =1

Note that cos² t / sin² t = cot² t = m²

So,

y / sin t ( m² + 1 ) = 1

But m = cot t, so m = cos t / sin t

So, sin t = cos t / m

Therefore,

y / (cos t / m ) ( m² +1 ) =1

Simplify:

y m / cos t (m² +1 ) =1

But x = y m^3 => y = x / m^3

So,

( x / m^3 ) * m / cos t ( m² +1 ) =1

Simplify numerator:

x / m^3 * m = x / m²

So,

x / m² * (m² +1 ) / cos t =1

But m = cot t = cos t / sin t

So, cos t = m sin t

But we can relate m and t, perhaps express in terms of m.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps parameterize in terms of another variable.

Alternatively, let's use the method of solving the system of equations.

We have:

x / cos t + y / sin t =1 ...(1)

and

x sin t / cos² t = y cos t / sin² t ...(2)

From equation (2):

x sin t / cos² t = y cos t / sin² t

Cross-multiplying:

x sin^3 t = y cos^3 t

So,

x = y (cos^3 t / sin^3 t) = y (cot t)^3

So, let's write x = y (cot t)^3

Let me denote u = cot t, so x = y u^3

Now, substitute into equation (1):

x / cos t + y / sin t =1

Which becomes:

(y u^3) / cos t + y / sin t = 1

But u = cot t = cos t / sin t

So, cos t = u sin t

So, substitute cos t = u sin t into the equation:

(y u^3) / (u sin t) + y / sin t =1

Simplify:

(y u^3)/(u sin t) = y u² / sin t

So,

y u² / sin t + y / sin t =1

Factor y / sin t:

y / sin t (u² + 1 ) =1

But u = cot t = cos t / sin t

We also have cos t = u sin t

So,

sin^2 t + cos^2 t =1 => sin^2 t + (u sin t)^2 =1

So,

sin^2 t (1 + u² ) =1

Thus,

sin t = 1 / sqrt(1 + u² )

Similarly, cos t = u / sqrt(1 + u² )

So, plug back into y / sin t (u² +1 ) =1

We have:

y * sqrt(1 + u² ) (u² +1 ) =1

Thus,

y = 1 / [ sqrt(1 + u² ) (u² +1 ) ]

But u = cot t, and x = y u^3

So,

x = [ 1 / ( sqrt(1 + u² ) (1 + u² )) ] * u^3

So,

x = u^3 / [ (1 + u² )^(3/2) ) ]

So, now, we can express x and y in terms of u:

x = u^3 / (1 + u² )^(3/2 )

y = 1 / [ (1 + u² )^(3/2 ) ]

So, let me write x and y in terms of u.

Let me denote v = u²

Then,

x = u^3 / (1 + u² )^(3/2 ) = u * (u² ) / (1 + u² )^(3/2 ) = u * v / (1 + v )^(3/2 )

Similarly,

y = 1 / (1 + u² )^(3/2 ) = 1 / (1 + v )^(3/2 )

But I'm not sure if this substitution helps. Maybe it's better to express x and y in terms of u.

Alternatively, we can write x = u^3 / (1 + u² )^(3/2 ) and y = 1 / (1 + u² )^(3/2 )

So, let's see if we can find a relationship between x and y.

From x = u^3 / (1 + u² )^(3/2 ), and y = 1 / (1 + u² )^(3/2 )

So, x = u^3 y

So,

x = u^3 y

But from u = cot t, and we have from equation (2): x sin t / cos² t = y cos t / sin² t

But perhaps this is not the way.

Alternatively, let's try to eliminate u between x and y.

From x = u^3 y, so u = (x / y )^(1/3 )

From y = 1 / (1 + u² )^(3/2 )

So,

(1 + u² )^(3/2 ) = 1 / y

Take both sides to the power 2/3:

1 + u² = (1 / y )^(2/3 )

So,

u² = (1 / y )^(2/3 ) -1

But u = (x / y )^(1/3 )

So,

u² = (x / y )^(2/3 )

Thus,

(x / y )^(2/3 ) = (1 / y )^(2/3 ) -1

Multiply both sides by y^(2/3 ):

x^(2/3 ) = 1 - y^(2/3 )

So,

x^(2/3 ) + y^(2/3 ) =1

That's interesting. So, the envelope of the family of lines F is the curve x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Wait, that's the equation of an astroid.

Yes, the astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Therefore, any point on this astroid is tangent to exactly one member of the family F.

So, the point C on AB that is not on any other segment from F other than AB must lie on this astroid as well.

Because if it's only on AB and no other PQ, then it's the point of tangency of AB with the astroid.

So, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Thus, we can find the equation of line AB, find its point of tangency with the astroid, and that point will be C.

Then, compute OC².

So, first, find the equation of AB.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2).

So, the slope of AB is ( sqrt(3)/2 - 0 ) / ( 0 - 1/2 ) = ( sqrt(3)/2 ) / ( -1/2 ) = -sqrt(3)

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2 )

So,

y = -sqrt(3) x + (sqrt(3)/2 )

So, equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

Now, find the point C where this line is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

To find the point of tangency, we can use the condition that the line is tangent to the astroid.

So, we can write the condition for tangency by solving the system:

1. y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

2. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1

And the condition that the system has exactly one solution (i.e., discriminant is zero). Alternatively, we can use the derivative condition.

But maybe taking the derivative of the astroid and setting it equal to the slope of AB.

So, let's parametrize the astroid.

Alternatively, differentiate implicitly.

Given x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1

Differentiate both sides with respect to x:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0

So,

dy/dx = - [ (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) ] = - ( y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) )

So, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at any point (x,y) is dy/dx = - ( y / x )^(1/3 )

Now, the line AB has a slope of -sqrt(3). So, at the point of tangency, the slope of the astroid must be -sqrt(3).

So,

- ( y / x )^(1/3 ) = -sqrt(3 )

=> ( y / x )^(1/3 ) = sqrt(3 )

Cube both sides:

y / x = (sqrt(3 ))^3 = 3 * sqrt(3 )

So,

y = 3 sqrt(3 ) x

But wait, this is a bit confusing. Wait, let's double-check.

We have:

dy/dx = - ( y / x )^{1/3 }

And we set this equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

So,

- ( y / x )^{1/3 } = -sqrt(3 )

Simplify:

( y / x )^{1/3 } = sqrt(3 )

Cubing both sides:

y
