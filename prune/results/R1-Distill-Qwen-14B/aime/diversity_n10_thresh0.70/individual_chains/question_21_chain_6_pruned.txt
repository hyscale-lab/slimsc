Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, let me make sure I understand what a b-eautiful number is. The problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: 

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n is a two-digit number in base b. That means n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1, right? Because the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So, if the two digits are d1 and d2, then d1 + d2 = sqrt(n).

Wait, okay, let's formalize this a bit. Let me denote the two digits as d1 (the first digit) and d2 (the second digit). Since it's a two-digit number in base b, d1 can range from 1 to b-1, and d2 can range from 0 to b-1. So, n can be expressed as n = d1 * b + d2.

And the condition is that d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). Therefore, substituting n, we have:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1 * b + d2)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1 * b + d2

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 = d1*b + d2

Let me rearrange the equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 - d1*b - d2 = 0

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of d1 and d2. But since both d1 and d2 are integers (digits), maybe I can find a way to express this equation in a more manageable form.

Alternatively, maybe I can let s = d1 + d2, so that s = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d1*b + d2). Then, s^2 = d1*b + d2.

But since s = d1 + d2, we can write:

s^2 = d1*b + d2

But d2 = s - d1, so substituting:

s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)

Simplify:

s^2 = d1*(b - 1) + s

So, rearranged:

d1*(b - 1) = s^2 - s

Then, solving for d1:

d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, this fraction must evaluate to an integer. Also, d2 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.

So, putting it all together, for each base b, we can iterate over possible s values and check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then check if d1 and d2 fall into their respective ranges.

But since the problem is asking for the least b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, I need to find for each b the number of valid s values that satisfy the above conditions.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:
   a. Determine the possible values of s (the sum of digits) such that:
      i. s must satisfy that s^2 is a two-digit number in base b. Since n = s^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b^2 -1. Therefore, sqrt(n) must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 -1). Which is roughly between sqrt(b) and b - something small. So s must be an integer in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1], since the maximum two-digit number is b^2 -1, whose square root is less than b.

   b. For each possible s in this range, check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1). If so, compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). Then compute d2 = s - d1. Check if d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d2 is between 0 and b-1.

   c. If all conditions are satisfied, then n = d1*b + d2 is a b-eautiful number. Count the number of such n for each b.

2. Find the smallest b for which the count exceeds 10.

But iterating b from 2 upwards and for each b, checking all possible s might be time-consuming, but since we're looking for the minimal b, perhaps we can find a pattern or a formula that can help us find the number of solutions more efficiently.

Alternatively, let's
