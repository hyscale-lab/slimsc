Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully again.

Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find how many minutes her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that her walking speed affects the time she takes to cover the 9 kilometers, but in each case, the total time includes the coffee shop time, which is t minutes. So, t is constant in both scenarios.

Wait, let me think. So, when her speed is s km/h, the time taken for the walk is 4 hours, but that includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, actually, the time she spends walking is 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, so again, subtracting t minutes would give the walking time.

Wait, but maybe I can model this using equations. Let me denote the walking time (excluding coffee shop) as something. Let me see.

So, the distance is 9 km. When she walks at s km/h, her walking time is (9/s) hours. But the total time, including coffee, is 4 hours. So, 9/s = 4 - t/60, because t is in minutes, and we need to convert it to hours.

Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the walking time is 9/(s+2) hours. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. So, 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60.

Hmm, okay, so we have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - t/60
2) 9/(s+2) = 2.4
