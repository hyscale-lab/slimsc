Okay, so I have this problem here. It says, let ω not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay, that seems pretty involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First off, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because the only condition is that ω ≠ 1, so it's one of the non-1 roots. So, ω satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the product is over k from 0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity, including 1. Wait, but ω^k for k=0 is ω⁰ = 1, so when k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Hmm, okay, so the product includes 1 as one of the factors. So the entire product is the product of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for each ω^k, as k ranges over all 13th roots of unity.

Wait, but when k=0, we get 1, so maybe that part is straightforward. The rest of the terms are for k=1 to 12, which are the primitive 13th roots. So, maybe I can write the entire product as (1) multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, the problem reduces to evaluating that product from k=1 to 12.

Let me denote P = product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, I need to compute P and then find P mod 1000.

Now, to compute P, perhaps I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at certain points. Since ω is a root of unity, we can consider the polynomial f(x) = 2 - 2x + x². Then, for each k, we have f(ω^k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

So, the product P is the product of f(ω^k) for k=1 to 12. But since ω^k runs through all the non-1 13th roots of unity, maybe I can relate this product to the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at the roots.

Wait, in general, for a polynomial F(x), the product over all roots α of F(x) of (x - α) is F(x). But here, I have a product of f(ω^k
