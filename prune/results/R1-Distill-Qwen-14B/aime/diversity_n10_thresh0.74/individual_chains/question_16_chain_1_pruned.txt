Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. So, for primes p, I should check if there exists an n with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². 

I remember that for primes p, the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p has solutions only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. So maybe for p², the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² also has solutions under certain conditions.

Let me list the primes in order and check for each whether n⁴ +1 is divisible by p². The primes start at 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.

Starting with p=2: Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4. For n=1: 1 +1=2, which mod 4 is 2, not 0. For n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4. For n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. So 4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n, right? So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's see if 9 divides n⁴ +1. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9. Let me check n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 has residues 0-8).

n=1: 1 +1=2 mod9 → 2
n=2: 16 +1=17 mod9= 17-9=8 →8
n=3: 81 +1=82 mod9. 8+2=10 →1
n=4: 256 +1=257 mod9. Let's see: 256 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, so 256-252=4. 4 +1=5 mod9
n=5: 625 +1=626 mod9. 625 is 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. 4+1=5 mod9.
Wait, that's same as n=4. Hmm, maybe I need a better way. Alternatively, perhaps using Euler's theorem: since φ(9)=6, so a^6 ≡1 mod9 if a coprime to 9.

So n⁴ mod9: Let's see n coprime to 9 (n=1,2,4,5,7,8).

n=1: 1^4=1 mod9
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=4: 256 mod9. 256 /9=28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9.
n=5: 5^4=625 mod9. 625-69*9=625-621=4. So 4 mod9.
n=7: 7^4= (7²)^2=49². 49 mod9=4. So 4²=16 mod9=7.
n=8: 8^4= (8²)^2=64². 64 mod9=1, so 1²=1 mod9.

So n⁴ mod9 can be 1,4,7. None of these are 8, which is -1 mod9. So n⁴ +1 mod9 can be 2,5,8. So 0 mod9 isn't achieved. Therefore, p=3 doesn't work.

Next, p=5. Let's check if 25 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let's compute n⁴ mod25.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to first solve n⁴ ≡ -1 mod5. Since 5 is prime, let's see what n⁴ mod5 can be. For primes p≡1 mod4, x²≡-1 mod p has solutions, but here we're dealing with x⁴≡-1 mod25.

Wait, perhaps we can lift solutions from mod5 to mod25. Let's see. First, let's find solutions to x⁴ ≡ -1 mod5.

Compute x⁴ mod5 for x=0,1,2,3,4:

0^4=0 mod5
1^4=1 mod5
2^4=16 mod5=1
3^4=81 mod5=1
4^4=256 mod5=1

Wait, so x⁴ mod5 is either 0 or 1. So -1 mod5 is 4. So x⁴ ≡4 mod5? But from the above, none of the x give x⁴=4 mod5. So there's no solution to x⁴ ≡-1 mod5. Therefore, no solution exists for x⁴ ≡-1 mod25 either, I think. So p=5 is out.

Next prime, p=7. Let's check if 49 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. First, check if there's a solution to x⁴ ≡ -1 mod7.

Compute x² mod7: The squares are 0,1,2,4, etc. Wait, let's compute x⁴ mod7. Let's compute x^4 mod7 for x=0 to 6.

x=0: 0
x=1:1
x=2:16 mod7=2
x=3:81 mod7= 81-11*7=81-77=4
x=4:256 mod7. Since 4^2=16 mod7=2, 4^4=(4²)^2=2²=4 mod7.
x=5:5^4. 5²=25 mod7=4, so
