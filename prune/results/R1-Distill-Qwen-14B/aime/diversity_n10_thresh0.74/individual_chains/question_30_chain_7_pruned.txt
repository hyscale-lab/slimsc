Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First off, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1. So, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. That’s good to know because it tells me about the properties of ω.

The expression I'm dealing with is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That looks kinda complicated, but maybe I can find a pattern or simplify it somehow.

Let me denote each term in the product as f(ω^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2. So, the product becomes the product of f(ω^k) for k=0 to 12. Wait, that might help. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k).

Hmm, how can I evaluate this product? I remember that for roots of unity, the product over k of (x - ω^k) is related to cyclotomic polynomials. Specifically, the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) where k runs through the primitive nth roots of unity. But in this case, I have a product over all the 13th roots of unity, including ω^0 = 1. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1, because that's the factorization of x^13 - 1 into linear factors.

But in my case, the product is of f(ω^k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. So, that's like plugging x = ω^k into f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2. So the product becomes product_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Wait, maybe I can think of this as evaluating the product of f(x) over all x being the 13th roots of unity. So, product_{x^13=1} (2 - 2x + x^2). Hmm, that might be a way to approach it.

I remember that if I have a polynomial P(x) and I take the product of P(x) over all x^m = 1, that product is equal to the resultant or something related to cyclotomic polynomials. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that product_{x^m=1} P(x) can be expressed as the product of P evaluated at each root of x^m=1.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can consider the polynomial Q(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2x + x^2). But wait, wait, no. Because each term in the product is a function of x^k, not x. Wait, no, actually, in my problem, each term is f(ω^k) where f(x)=2-2x+x². So, the product is over all the roots of x^13 =1, evaluated at f(x). So, product_{x^13=1} f(x) = product_{x^13=1} (2 - 2x + x²).

I think there's a formula for such products. I recall that the product of (a - x) over all x^m =1 is a^m -1. But in this case, it's not linear. So, maybe I can think of f(x) as a quadratic in x. Let me write f(x) = x² - 2x + 2.

So, f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. The product over all x^13 =1 of (x² - 2x + 2). Hmm, maybe I can relate this to polynomials evaluated at roots of unity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of f(x) as a polynomial in x, and the product over all x^13=1 would correspond to evaluating the resultant or something. Wait, another approach: for any polynomial P(x), the product over all x where x^m = 1 of P(x) is equal to the product of P(ω^k) for k=0 to m-1, which is the same as the product over the mth roots of unity.

Wait, I think I remember that product_{k=0}^{m-1} P(ω^k) = resultant(P, x^m -1) or something like that. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product over all roots of x^m -1 of P(x), which can be written as the resultant of P(x) and x^m -1.

But I'm not super clear on that. Maybe another approach: for each x^13 =1, f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. So, perhaps I can consider the product as the product over all x^13=1 of (x
