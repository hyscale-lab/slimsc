Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.

First, I'll note that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers. That means they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward—it's just the sum of the three variables equaling 300. The second equation looks more complicated, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to group the terms differently.

Let's group terms by each variable. For example, terms with a²: a²b + a²c. Similarly, terms with b²: b²a + b²c, and terms with c²: c²a + c²b. So, factoring a² from the first two terms, I get a²(b + c). Similarly, b²(a + c) and c²(a + b).

So, the expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that's a bit cleaner. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), because a + b + c is 300. Similarly, (a + c) would be (300 - b), and (a + b) would be (300 - c).

So substituting these into the expression, we get:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

Let me write that out:
= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³
= 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³).

And this is equal to 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression further or find a way to relate it to the first equation. Let's think about what else we know. We have a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, we can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)² and ab + ac + bc.

Let me compute that:
a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 300² - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Similarly, for a³ + b³ + c³, I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, substituting these into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me plug in the expressions we have.

First, a² + b² + c² = 90000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

So, 300*(90000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - [300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 300*(90000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)):
= 300*90000 - 300*2(ab + ac + bc)
= 27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc).

Now, compute [300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc]:
= 27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:

[27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc)] - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Now, simplify the terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600(ab + ac + bc) + 900(ab + ac + bc) = 300(ab + ac + bc).

So, now we have:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me write that:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

I can factor out a 3 from all terms:

3[100(ab + ac + bc) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's an equation involving ab + ac + bc and abc. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + ac + bc.

Then, our equation becomes:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

But we also have S = 300, so maybe we can relate Q and P through symmetric polynomials.

Wait, the equation is 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

I can rewrite this as:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, 100Q = P + 2,000,000.

But I need another equation to relate Q and P. Let me recall that for three variables, we can use the identity:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a).

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct identity is:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc).

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between S, Q, and P.

We know that:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think. Another approach is that for three variables, the cubic can be expressed as:

x^3 - Sx^2 + Qx - P = 0,

where x can be a,
