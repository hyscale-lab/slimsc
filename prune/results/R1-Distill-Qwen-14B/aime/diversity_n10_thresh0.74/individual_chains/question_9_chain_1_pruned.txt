Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. And then I need to find the product xy. 

Let me write down the given equations first. 

The first equation is: 
log_x(y^x) = 10

The second equation is:
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help here. Let me recall: log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So I can use that to simplify both equations.

Starting with the first equation:
log_x(y^x) = 10
Using the property, that becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, but log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x. I also remember that log_b(a) = (ln a)/(ln b). So maybe I can express both equations in terms of natural logarithms. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate x and y without getting into natural logs. Let me think.

Let's denote log_x(y) as some variable to simplify. Let me say log_x(y) = k. Then, the first equation becomes x * k = 10.

But since log_x(y) = k, that means y = x^k. That's because if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c. So, y is x raised to the power of k.

So now, I have y = x^k, and from the first equation, x * k = 10. So, k = 10/x.

So, y = x^(10/x). Hmm, that's an expression for y in terms of x. Maybe I can use this in the second equation.

The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, applying the logarithm power rule: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So, 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, log_y(x) is equal to 1 / log_x(y), because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). Since log_x(y) is k, then log_y(x) is 1/k.

So, substituting that in, the second equation becomes 4y * (1/k) = 10.

But we already have k = 10/x, so 1/k = x/10. So substituting that, we get 4y*(x/10) = 10.

Simplify this equation: (4xy)/10 = 10. Multiply both sides by 10: 4xy = 100. Then, divide both sides by 4: xy = 25.

Wait, is that possible? So, I end up with xy = 25? That seems straightforward, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting again:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10 → x * log_x(y) = 10 → k = 10/x where k = log_x(y). So, y = x^{10/x}.

2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 → 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Since log_y(x) = 1/k = x/10, so 4y*(x/10) = 10 → (4xy)/10 = 10 → 4xy = 100 → xy =25.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the product xy is 25. 

But just to be thorough, maybe I can find the actual values of x and y to check.

We have y = x^{10/x}, and xy =25. So, substituting y into xy =25 gives x*(x^{10/x}) =25 → x^{ (10/x) +1 } =25.

But solving for x here might be complicated. Let me see if I can find x.

Let me denote t = x. Then, t^{10/t +1} =25.

Hmm, maybe take natural logarithm on both sides: ln(t^{10/t +1}) = ln(25).

Which becomes (10/t +1) * ln(t) = ln(25).

This is a transcendental equation, which might not have a straightforward algebraic solution. So perhaps it's better to assume that xy=25 is correct, given that all the steps seem to check out.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter substitution or a way to express x and y in terms that can be solved.

Wait, but perhaps using logarithms with base x and base y could lead us to another relation.

Let me think about another approach. Let me express both equations in terms of natural logarithms.

First equation: log_x(y^x) =10 → (ln y^x)/(ln x) =10 → (x ln y)/(ln x) =10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10 → (ln x^{4y})/(ln y)=10 → (4y ln x)/(ln y)=10.

So, now I have two equations:

1. (x ln y)/(ln x) =10 → x (ln y)/ (ln x) =10.

2. (4y ln x)/(ln y) =10.

Let me denote (ln y)/(ln x) as m. Then, equation 1 becomes x * m =10.

Equation 2: (4y ln x)/(ln y) = 4y / m =10, because (ln x)/(ln y) =1/m.

So, equation 2: (4y)/m =10 → 4y =10 m → y = (10 m)/4 = (5 m)/2.

From equation 1: x * m =10 → x =10/m.

So, now we have x=10/m and y=(5m)/2.

But we also have y =x^{10/x} from earlier. Let's plug these into that equation.

y = (x)^{10/x} → (5m/2) = (10/m)^{10/(10/m)}.

Simplify the exponent: 10/(10/m)=10*(m/10)=m.

So, (5m/2) = (10/m)^m.

Hmm, this gives (5m/2) = (10/m)^m.

This seems complicated, but maybe I can take natural logs on both sides.

ln(5m/2) = m ln(10/m).

Let me rewrite that:

ln(5m/2) = m (ln 10 - ln m).

Expanding the right-hand side: m ln 10 - m ln m.

So, the equation becomes:

ln(5m/2) = m ln 10 - m ln m.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation in m, which is difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe we can guess a value for m that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps m is a rational number, maybe m=2 or m=1.

Let me test m=2.

Left side: ln(
