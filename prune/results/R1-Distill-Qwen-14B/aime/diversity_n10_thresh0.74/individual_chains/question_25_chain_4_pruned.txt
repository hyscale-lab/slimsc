Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, let me jot down the numbers given. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given for everyone. Then, some people own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and others own a garden spade. 

The numbers are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Wait, and all of them own candy hearts, right? So candy hearts are universal.

Now, the problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. My goal is to find out how many own all fourâ€”so candy hearts, diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.

Hmm, I remember something about sets and Venn diagrams. Maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let me recall the formula for four sets. Oh wait, but since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, which is one of the four, maybe I can think of it as three sets plus the universal set.

Wait, no, actually, candy hearts are like a fourth item. So each resident owns at least one thing, which is the candy hearts. So let's see. Let me denote the four items as C (candy hearts), D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), and S (spade).

But since everyone owns C, maybe I should represent the problem in terms of the other three items. So, every resident owns C, so when considering ownership of D, G, and S, they might own just those, but not necessarily all four. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should model the problem in terms of subsets.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of the problem as four sets where C is the universal set. So, all other sets are subsets of C. But since the problem is about how many people own combinations of D, G, S, along with C, which everyone has.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the problem as having four categories: owning 1, 2, 3, or 4 items. But the problem already gives us some numbers: 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and everyone owns at least one (since they all own C). So, the rest must own exactly one or exactly four.

Wait, but I need to find how many own all four. Let's think.

The total number of residents is 900. The number who own exactly two is 437, exactly three is 234. So, the remaining residents must own exactly one or exactly four.

Let me calculate how many own exactly one plus exactly four. So, 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. So, 229 residents own either exactly one item or exactly four.

But wait, candy hearts are owned by everyone, so owning exactly one item can't be owning just D, G, or S. Because if someone owns exactly one, it has to be C, but wait, since
