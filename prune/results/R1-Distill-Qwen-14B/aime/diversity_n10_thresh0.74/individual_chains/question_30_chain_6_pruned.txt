Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me make sure I understand what ω is. Since ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1, it must be a primitive 13th root. That means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, the minimal polynomial for ω would be the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Right?

Now, the product given is over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So, effectively, the product is the same as from k=1 to 12, since k=0 contributes a factor of 1.

So, the product simplifies to ∏_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, can I factor this expression somehow? Let me see. Let's consider the term for each k: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can write this as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me try that.

Let me set z = ω^k. Then, the term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So, that's z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, can I factor this quadratic? Let me compute the discriminant: b² - 4ac = ( -2 )² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots would be [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, it factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). Therefore, 2 - 2z + z² = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So, substituting back z = ω^k, each term in the product becomes (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product is ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

I can rearrange the product as [∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Hmm, so I have two separate products. Let me think about each one separately. Let me denote P = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - a), where a is a constant. Then, what is P?

Wait, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) for k from 1 to 12 is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So, if I evaluate this at x = a, then Φ₁₃(a) = a¹² + a¹¹ + ... + a + 1.

But wait, in our case, we have ∏_{k=1}^{12}
