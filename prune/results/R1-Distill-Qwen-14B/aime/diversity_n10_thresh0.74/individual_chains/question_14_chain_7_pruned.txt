Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if I change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such number. So, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. That's interesting. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. Therefore, N has four digits, say a, b, c, d. Then, the numbers obtained by replacing each digit with 1 one at a time are:

- Replace a: 1b c d
- Replace b: a1 c d
- Replace c: a b1 d
- Replace d: a b c1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since I'm looking for the greatest such N, I should start from 9999 and check each number, but that might take too long. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

First, let's think about what replacing a digit with 1 does to the number. Let's denote the original number as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. When we replace a digit, say the thousands digit a with 1, we get a new number N1 = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Similarly, replacing the hundreds digit gives N2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d, and so on.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 should result in a number that's a multiple of 7.

Let me try to formalize this. Let's denote the original number as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Then, the four modified numbers are:

1. N1 = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d
2. N2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d
3. N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d
4. N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, for each i from 1 to 4, Ni ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me express each Ni in terms of N. Let's see:

N1 = 1000 + (100b + 10c + d) = 1000 + (N - 1000a)
Similarly, N2 = (1000a) + 100 + (10c + d) = 100*(10a + 1) + (10c + d)
Wait, maybe that's not the most straightforward approach.

Another approach: Let's consider N1 mod 7. Since N1 must be 0 mod7, and N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000a). But N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, so N - 1000a = 100b + 10c + d. Therefore, N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod7.

Similarly, N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

Same for N3 and N4.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express each of these modified numbers in terms of N and the digit being replaced.

Let me denote the digits as a, b, c, d.

So, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When I replace a with 1, N1 = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d.

So, N1 = 1000 + (100b + 10c + d) = 1000 + (N - 1000a).

Similarly, N2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = 100*(10a + 1) + (10c + d).

Wait, perhaps it's better to subtract N1 from N.

Let me compute N1 - N = (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 1000 - 1000a.

Which is 1000*(1 - a).

Similarly, N1 - N = 1000*(1 - a).

But N1 is divisible by 7, and N is the original number. So, N1 ≡ 0 mod7 ⇒ N + (1000*(1 - a)) ≡ 0 mod7.

Wait, but N1 = N - 1000a + 1000.

So, N1 = N - 1000a + 1000.

Thus, N1 ≡ N + ( -1000a + 1000 ) mod7.

But since N1 ≡0 mod7, then:

N + ( -1000a + 1000 ) ≡ 0 mod7.

Which implies:

N ≡ (1000a - 1000) mod7
