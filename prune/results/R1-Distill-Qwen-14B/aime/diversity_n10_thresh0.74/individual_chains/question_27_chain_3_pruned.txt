Okay, let me try to figure out this problem about the torus and the sphere. Hmm, so the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, it's like a donut shape where the radius of the tube is 3, and the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the donut is 6.

Then, there's a sphere S with radius 11. We have two scenarios: when T rests inside S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let's understand the geometry of the torus. A torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution generated by rotating a circle around an external axis. The standard equation for a torus is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation (also called the major radius), and r is the radius of the generating circle (minor radius).

In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So, the equation would be (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

We need to find the circles of tangency when the torus is inside and outside the sphere. Let's consider both cases.

First, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. The radii of these circles on the torus will give us r_i and r_o, respectively.

But wait, no. The problem says that the circles are along which the torus is tangent to the sphere. So, maybe more accurately, the torus T is tangent to the sphere S along a circle, which lies on both surfaces. The radius of this circle (in 3D space) is r_i when T is inside S and r_o when T is outside.

So, perhaps we can model this situation by considering the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus. Since the torus is tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether the torus is inside or outside.

Wait, but the torus is not a sphere, it's a surface of revolution. So, maybe the concept is a bit different. Perhaps the maximum and minimum distances from the center of the sphere to the torus surface will give the points of tangency.

Alternatively, maybe we should model the torus and sphere in 3D and find the circles where they are tangent.

Let me think
