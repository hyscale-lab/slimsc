Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the point I, which is equidistant to all the faces. That distance is given in a particular form, and I have to find the sum m + n + p where the distance is m√n / p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, if a point is equidistant to all four faces, it's called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

I recall that the formula for the inradius r of a tetrahedron is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

Looking at the edge lengths, all opposite edges are equal. AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe this tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here, but maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.

Given that opposite edges are equal, perhaps there's a way to compute the volume without too much trouble. I remember that for such tetrahedrons, there's a formula called the Cayley-Menger determinant which can be used to compute the volume based on all the edge lengths.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume V = √[ CM / 288 ], where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, I can set up this determinant with the given edge lengths.

Let me assign the edge lengths properly:

AB = √41 ⇒ a² = 41

AC = √80 ⇒ b² = 80

AD = √89 ⇒ c² = 89

BC = √89 ⇒ d² = 89

BD = √80 ⇒ e² = 80

CD = √41 ⇒ f² = 41

So plugging these into the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, no, let me double-check. The matrix is 5x5 with the first row and column as 0,1,1,1,1 and the rest:

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² → 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² → 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD² → 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0 → 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Yes, that's correct.

Now, computing the Cayley-Menger determinant (CM) might be a bit involved, but let's proceed step by step.

The determinant of a 5x5 matrix can be a bit tedious, but maybe we can find some pattern or symmetry here since opposite edges are equal.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to compute the volume using another method, but I'm not sure. Let's try computing the determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron when opposite edges are equal. I remember that in such a case, the volume can be computed using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / (6 sqrt(2))

Wait, no, I think that's for a different case. Maybe not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the tetrahedron can be considered as two triangles connected along an edge, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

So, let's write out the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

To compute the determinant, let's denote the matrix as M.

The determinant can be calculated by expanding along the first row.

det(M) = 0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)

But since the first element is 0, that term drops out.

So,

det(M) = -1 * det(M11) + 1 * det(M12) - 1 * det(M13) + 1 * det(M1
