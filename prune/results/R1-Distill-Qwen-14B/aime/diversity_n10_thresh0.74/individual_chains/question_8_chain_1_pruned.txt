Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. That means we're dealing with the number of ways to distribute 300 units among three variables. Without any other constraints, the number of solutions would be a combination with repetition, which is (300 + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1) = (302 choose 2). But we have another equation to satisfy, so we can't just use that directly.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor it somehow. Let's see, each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. So, for example, a²b and a²c both have a². Maybe I can factor a² out of those two terms. Let me try that:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Yes, that simplifies a bit. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), because if a + b + c = 300, then subtracting a from both sides gives b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So, substituting these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit better. So, now each term is of the form x²(300 - x), where x is either a, b, or c. Let me write that out:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

I think I can expand each term:

a²*300 - a³ + b²*300 - b³ + c²*300 - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

That's a more manageable equation. Maybe I can relate this to known formulas or find a way to express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of each other or in terms of a + b + c.

I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). Since a + b + c = 300, so (300)² = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc). Let me note that down.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + ac + bc, and P = abc. I'm not sure if P will come into play here, but let's see.

Also, another identity is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3 S Q + 3 P.

So, substituting into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

From the identity above, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q. So,

300*(90,000 - 2Q) - [S³ - 3 S Q + 3 P] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Then, subtract [S³ - 3 S Q + 3 P]. Since S = 300, S³ is 300^3 = 27,000,000. So,

27,000,000 - 600Q - (27,000,000 - 3*300*Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600Q -27,000,000 + 900Q -3P = 6,000,000.

Now, simplifying the terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600Q + 900Q = 300Q.

So, we have 300Q -3P = 6,000,000.

Which simplifies to 300Q -3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so we have P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But P is the product abc, which is a nonnegative integer since a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So, 100Q - 2,000,000 must be nonnegative. Therefore, 100Q ≥ 2,000,000 → Q ≥ 20,000.

So, Q must be at least 20,000.

Also, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q = ab + ac + bc is also an integer. So, Q is an integer ≥20,000.

Additionally, from the first equation, Q is related to S and a² + b² + c². Since S = 300, and a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q, then 90,000 - 2Q must be nonnegative because squares are nonnegative. So,

90,000 - 2Q ≥ 0 → 2Q ≤90,000 → Q ≤45,000.

So, Q is between 20,000 and 45,000 inclusive.

So, 20,000 ≤ Q ≤45,000.

Also, since Q = ab + ac + bc, and a + b + c =300, perhaps we can find constraints on the possible values of Q.

Wait, let me think about the maximum and minimum possible values of Q.

For fixed S =300, the maximum of Q occurs when two variables are as large as possible and the third is as small as possible. For example, when one variable is 0, and the other two sum to 300.

Suppose c =0, then a + b =300, and Q = ab + 0 +0 =ab. The maximum ab occurs when a = b =150, so ab =22500.

But wait, 22500 is much less than 20,000, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that Q must be at least 20,000. Hmm, that can't be. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. If a, b, c are all 100, then ab + ac + bc would be 100*100 +100*100 +100*100=30,000. So, that's 30,000, which is within 20,000 to 45,000.

But if c is zero, and a and b are 150 each, then Q=150*150=22,500. So, 22,500 is higher than 20,000. So, maybe Q can be as low as when two variables are as small as possible.

Wait, but if two variables are zero, then Q would be zero, but that's not possible because then P would be zero as well, but 100Q - P =2,000,000 would mean 0 -0=2,000,000, which is not possible. So, maybe the minimal Q is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in
