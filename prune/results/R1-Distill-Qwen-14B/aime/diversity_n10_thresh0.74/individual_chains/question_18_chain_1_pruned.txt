Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles inside a regular dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 sides, right? The problem says that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to visualize this.

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, it's possible to form rectangles by connecting certain vertices. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, it should have several lines (both sides and diagonals) that can form these rectangles.

I think the key here is to figure out how to choose four points that form a rectangle. In a regular polygon, a rectangle is formed when the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the angles are all right angles. But how do the sides and diagonals come into play?

Maybe I should think about the properties of a regular dodecagon. Each internal angle is 150 degrees, but that's probably not directly relevant here. Instead, I should consider the lengths of the sides and diagonals. In a regular polygon, the length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices it skips. For example, in a dodecagon, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that skips more vertices.

Wait, but for a rectangle, the sides don't have to be of the same length, but opposite sides must be equal. Also, the diagonals of the rectangle must be equal. So, in the context of the dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle would correspond to either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and the diagonals of the rectangle would also be diagonals of the dodecagon.

I think it would help to model the dodecagon on a coordinate system, maybe inscribed in a unit circle. Each vertex can be represented as a point on the circle, with angles separating them by 30 degrees since 360/12 = 30. So, the vertices are at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, and so on up to 330°.

If I can find four points that form a rectangle, their coordinates should satisfy the rectangle properties. But maybe there's a combinatorial way to count these without getting into coordinates.

Another approach: in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, you can pair up opposite sides, which are parallel. The same goes for certain diagonals. So, perhaps rectangles are formed by choosing two pairs of these parallel lines.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, how many pairs of parallel sides or diagonals are there? Each side has a parallel side opposite to it, but there are also other diagonals that are parallel.

Let me think: in a regular n-gon, the number of directions for sides and diagonals is n. But for a rectangle, we need two different directions that are perpendicular to each other. So, maybe we need to find pairs of these directions that are perpendicular.

In a regular dodecagon, the angle between adjacent vertices is 30°, so the angle between two lines from the center to adjacent vertices is 30°. For two lines to be perpendicular, the angle between them must be 90°, which is 3*30°. So, in terms of steps between vertices, that's 3 steps apart. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps if two chords (sides or diagonals) are perpendicular, the number of vertices they skip corresponds to a 90° angle. Since each vertex is 30°, then 90° is 3 steps. So a diagonal that skips 3 vertices would be perpendicular to another diagonal that skips 3 vertices in the other direction.

Wait, that might not be entirely correct. Let me think again. If I have a diagonal that connects vertex V0 to V3, that spans 3 steps, which is 90°, right? So, another diagonal that connects V0 to V9 would span 9 steps, which is 270°, but that's the same as -90°, so it's also a 90° angle in the other direction.

Wait, maybe
