Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. The problem says that ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. It also mentions that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. A convex hexagon means all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and none of the sides cross each other. Equilateral hexagon implies all sides are of equal length, so AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA. Also, opposite sides are parallel, so AB || CD || EF, BC || DE || FA.

Wait, since all opposite sides are parallel, this hexagon must be a special type of convex hexagon. I remember that such hexagons can sometimes be thought of as being formed by three pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by a certain distance. Maybe it's similar to a hexagon you get by extending the sides of a triangle.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me visualize that. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a larger triangle, and the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, the triangle is the outer triangle when these sides are extended.

I think this triangle is sometimes called the "outer triangle" of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, maybe this outer triangle relates to the hexagon in a specific way.

Maybe I can model the hexagon as being between two similar triangles. The inner triangle would be the hexagon itself, and the outer triangle is the one given. Wait, no, the hexagon isn't a triangle, but perhaps the sides of the outer triangle are each split by the hexagon into segments.

Since each pair of opposite sides is parallel, the hexagon might be similar to the outer triangle but scaled down. Or perhaps the hexagon is a section between the outer triangle and a smaller, inner triangle.

Let me consider the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let's call this triangle T with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The hexagon is inside this triangle T, and each side of the hexagon is part of a line that extends from the sides of T.

Wait, in a way, the hexagon can be considered as a "truncated" version of the triangle T. Each side of T is divided into three segments by the hexagon. For example, side AB is extended beyond B to form part of the hexagon's side. Similarly, CD and EF are extended.

Wait, maybe each side of the outer triangle is divided into three parts by the points where the hexagon's sides meet. Let me think: if I have triangle T, and I draw lines parallel to each side, but offset towards the interior, each parallel line would create a smaller similar triangle inside. But in the case of a hexagon, perhaps three such lines are drawn, each parallel to a side, leading to a hexagon.

But wait, in this case, the hexagon is equilateral with all sides equal and
