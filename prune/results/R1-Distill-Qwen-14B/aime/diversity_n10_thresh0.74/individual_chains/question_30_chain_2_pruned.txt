Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

Hmm, okay. First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

The expression I'm dealing with is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote each term as f(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Wait, since ω is a root of unity, maybe I can manipulate f(k) in some way. Let me see. Let me factor f(k):

f(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Hmm, maybe I can write this as 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Or perhaps factor something else. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a quadratic in ω^k.

Let me try that. Let me set x = ω^k. Then f(k) = 2 - 2x + x². So f(k) = x² - 2x + 2.

Wait, that's a quadratic equation. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots.

The quadratic equation x² - 2x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, the roots would be [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i.

So, f(k) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), since (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 - i² = 1 - (-1) = 2, which is the constant term, and the sum is 2, which is the coefficient of x. So, yes, f(k) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Therefore, f(k) = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the product over k from 0 to 12 of f(k) is the same as the product over k of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Which can be written as the product over k of (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over k of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, this becomes [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] × [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, I remember that the product over k of (x - ω^k) is equal to x¹³ - 1, because ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. But wait, that product is for x - ω^k from k=0 to 12, which is indeed x¹³ - 1.

But in our case, we have x = (1 + i) and x = (1 - i). So, substituting x = (1 + i) into the product, we get (1 + i)^13 - 1, and similarly for (1 - i).

Wait, but hold on, the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, but actually, if we think about it, the product is Φ₁₃(a) when a is a primitive 13th root, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, more accurately, since ω is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x¹³ - 1. So, yeah, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹³ - 1.

So, if I substitute x = (1 + i), then product_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly for (1 - i).

Wait, but in our case, the product is over (ω^k - (1 + i)). So, that's equal to product_{k=0}^{12} (-(1 + i) - (-ω^k)) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) + ω^k) = - product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k + (1 + i)).

But wait, perhaps I can relate it to x = (1 + i). Let me think: product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) with a sign. Since each term is (ω^k - a) = -(a -
