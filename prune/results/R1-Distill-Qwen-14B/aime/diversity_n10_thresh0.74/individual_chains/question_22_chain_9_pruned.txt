Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which might mean it's something like a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular because it's just equilateral. The problem says that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, first, let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. Since it's equilateral, all sides are equal in length, but they can have different angles. Opposite sides being parallel might mean the hexagon is similar to a regular one but stretched or compressed in certain directions.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend these sides, they meet to form a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300. I think this triangle is called the outer triangle or something similar. I remember in some problems, especially with hexagons, the sides can be related through similar triangles or ratios.

Wait, the sides AB, CD, EF are being extended to form a triangle. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, this triangle must be similar in some way to the hexagon's structure.

Let me try to recall if there's a formula or theorem that relates the sides of such a triangle to the side length of the hexagon. I think it might involve similar triangles because when you extend sides, especially in a convex polygon with parallel opposite sides, the resulting triangle's sides are proportional to the hexagon's sides.

Wait, maybe it's something with the concept of similar triangles and the ratio of the sides. Let me consider the triangle formed by the extensions. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, 300. Let me check if this is a right triangle or something. 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300² is 90000, so no, it's not a right triangle. Hmm.

But perhaps the triangle is similar to smaller triangles inside the hexagon. Maybe the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by cutting off smaller triangles from the corners of this larger triangle.

Wait, another thought: in a convex
