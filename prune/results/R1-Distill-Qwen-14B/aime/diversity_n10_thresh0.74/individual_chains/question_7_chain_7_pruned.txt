Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon red or blue. Each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with a 50-50 chance. We need to find the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that moves all the blue vertices to where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. A regular octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue. We can represent the colorings as binary sequences of length 8, where each bit is 0 (red) or 1 (blue). Since each color is equally likely, there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings.

Now, we're looking for colorings where there exists a rotation such that every blue vertex (1) ends up where a red vertex (0) was originally. So, if we rotate the octagon by some number of positions, all the blue vertices move to positions that were previously red.

Wait, that sounds a bit like a permutation. The rotation would permute the vertices, and we want that for each blue vertex in the original coloring, its image under the rotation was red. So, if we denote the rotation as a permutation σ, then for every vertex v, if v is blue, σ(v) must be red.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the red vertices under some rotation. Or more precisely, the blue vertices are a translate of the red vertices.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of orbits? Since the octagon is regular, the rotations form a group acting on the vertices.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that a rotation by k positions (where k is an integer from 0 to 7) will shift each vertex k places clockwise. Then, for a given coloring, we need that when we rotate by some k, every blue vertex moves to a red vertex. So, the blue vertices must be a subset of the red vertices after shifting by k.

Wait, but the problem says "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, the original positions had some red and blue. After rotating, the blue vertices are where red were before the rotation. So, it's like the image of the blue set under the rotation is a subset of the red set.

Alternatively, if B is the set
