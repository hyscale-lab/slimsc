Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let me recall that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. So the surface area (SA) of the box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume (V) is xyz = 23.

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must enclose the box completely. The sphere's diameter must be equal to the space diagonal of the box because that's the longest distance inside the box, right? The space diagonal of a rectangular box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, which is (1/2)*sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Thus, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z², given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Alright, so I need to minimize x² + y² + z² with constraints:
1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. xyz = 23

I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a smarter way since it's a symmetric problem.

Let me see. The problem is symmetric in x, y, z, so perhaps the minimal value occurs when x = y = z? But wait, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, x = 3. Then volume would be x³ = 27, which is more than 23. So, a cube isn't the solution here because the volume is too big. So, the minimal sphere's radius isn't achieved when x=y=z. That means the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs at a non-cube box.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to use some inequality or optimization techniques with the given constraints.

Let me write down the two constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
   So, xy + yz + xz = 27.

2. xyz = 23.

I need to find the minimum of x² + y² + z².

I remember that for positive real numbers, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality relates sums and products. Alternatively, maybe using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

Wait, another approach. Let's denote s = x + y + z, p = xy + yz + xz = 27, and q = xyz =23.

We also know that x² + y² + z² = s² - 2p. Since p is 27, so x² + y² + z² = s² - 54.

Hmm, so if I can find the minimal s², then I can find the minimal x² + y² + z².

But wait, actually, I need to minimize x² + y² + z², which is s² -54. So, minimizing x² + y² +z² is equivalent to minimizing s².

So, if I can find the minimal possible s² given p=27 and q=23, that would help.

But is that the right path? Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

I know that for three variables, we can use the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, x² + y² + z² = s^2 - 54, where s = x + y + z.

So, if I can find the minimal s^2, then subtract 54, and divide by 4 to get r^2.

But how do I relate s to p and q?

Hmm, maybe using AM ≥ GM on x, y, z.

Wait, the AM is s/3, and GM is (xyz)^(1/3) = (23)^(1/3).
