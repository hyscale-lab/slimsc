Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have a set of rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. 

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. I'm dealing with rectangular boxes, which means their lengths, widths, and heights can vary, but they all have the same surface area and volume. The sphere that can contain each of these boxes must have a radius that is at least half the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere's diameter must be equal to or larger than the box's diagonal to fit entirely inside the sphere. So, the radius r is half of the space diagonal.

So, the space diagonal of a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c is given by sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r is sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2, and r squared would be (a² + b² + c²)/4.

My goal is to find the minimum possible value of r squared, which is equivalent to minimizing (a² + b² + c²). So, I need to find the minimum value of a² + b² + c² given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Let me write down the given constraints:

1. Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54
2. Volume: abc = 23

So, I have two equations:

Equation 1: ab + bc + ac = 27 (divided both sides by 2)
Equation 2: abc = 23

And I need to minimize a² + b² + c².

I remember that for positive real numbers a, b, c, the expression a² + b² + c² can be related to (a + b + c)². Specifically, (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, if I can find (a + b + c)², I can get a² + b² + c² by subtracting 2(ab + bc + ac).

Wait, since ab + bc + ac is 27, then 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54. Therefore, (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 54.

But I need to find a² + b² + c², so I can write it as (a + b + c)² - 54.

So, to minimize a² + b² + c², I need to minimize (a + b + c)² - 54, which is equivalent to minimizing (a + b + c)².

Alternatively, I can think of it as minimizing the sum a + b + c, since the square function is increasing for positive numbers.

Wait, but how is that helpful? Maybe I can use some inequality here. I know that for positive numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, maybe I can find a relation between a, b, c.

But considering that I have two constraints, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers. That's a method in calculus for finding the extrema of a function subject to constraints.

Let me set up the problem for Lagrange multipliers. Let me denote the function to minimize as f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c². The constraints are g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac - 27 = 0 and h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0.

So, the method involves setting up the gradients:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h

Which gives us the system of equations:

2a = λ(b + c) + μ(bc)
2b = λ(a + c) + μ(ac)
2c = λ(a + b) + μ(ab)

Plus the constraints:

ab + bc + ac = 27
abc = 23

Hmm, okay, so that's a system of five equations with five variables: a, b, c, λ, μ.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe the variables are symmetric. Maybe at the minimum, a = b = c? Wait, but if a = b = c, then it would be a cube. Let's check if that's possible.

If a = b = c, then the surface area is 6a² = 54, so a² = 9, a = 3. Then the volume would be a³ = 27. But the given volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube is not possible here. Therefore, the minimal sphere can't be the same as the cube case.

So, the box isn't a cube, meaning a, b, c are not all equal. So, I can't assume symmetry here. Hmm, but perhaps two sides are equal? Maybe it's a square box, but not a cube. Let's see.

Suppose a = b ≠ c. Then, the surface area would be 2(ab + bc + ac) = 2(a² + 2ac) = 54. So, a² + 2ac = 27.

The volume is a²c = 23.

So, from the volume, c = 23 / a².

Substituting into the surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23 / a²) = 27

Simplify:

a² + (46 / a) = 27

Multiply both sides by a:

a³ + 46 = 27a

So, a³ -27a + 46 = 0

Hmm, let me try to find rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test a=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. 8 -54 is -46 +46=0. So, a=2 is a root.

So, factor the polynomial: (a - 2)(a² + 2a -23) = 0

So, the other roots are from a² + 2a -23=0, which gives a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6). Since a must be positive, a = -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ 3.449.

But wait, in our case, a=2 is a solution. So, if a=2, then c=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, let's see what a² + b² + c² is when a=b=2, c=5.75.

Then, a² + b² + c² = 4 +4 + (23/4)² = 8 + (529/16) = (128/16) + (529/16) = 657/16 ≈41.0625.

Alternatively, if a= -1 + 2√6 ≈3.449, then c=23/(a²). Let's compute a²: ( (-1 + 2√6) )² =1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6.

So, c=23/(25 -4√6). Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

c=23*(25 +4√6)/( (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 )=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625-96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529 =1/23. So, c=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, a= -1 +2√6≈3.449, c≈(25 +4*2.449)/23≈(25 +9.796)/23≈34.796/23≈1.513.

Now, compute a² + b² + c². Since a = b, it's 2a² + c².

a²= (25 -4√6), so 2a²=50 -8√6.

c²= (25 +4√6)^2 / 23²= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, total a² + b² + c² is (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Hmm, this seems messy, but let's compute it numerically:

50 -8√6 ≈50 -8*2.449≈50 -19.592≈30.408

(721 +200√6)/529≈ (721 +200*2.449)/529≈
