Okay, I have this problem to solve: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First off, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity since ω ≠ 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

The expression I need to compute is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out as a product:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm, each term in the product is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor or rewrite each term to make it easier. Let me first look at the term inside the product:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}

Hmm, can I factor this? Let's see. Let me rearrange the terms:

= ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2

That's a quadratic in ω^k. Let me denote x = ω^k for a moment, so the term becomes x² - 2x + 2. So each term is x² - 2x + 2 evaluated at x = ω^k.

I wonder if x² - 2x + 2 can be factored or related to a cyclotomic polynomial. Let me compute its roots. The discriminant is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so the roots are complex: [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i.

Interesting, so x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So in terms of complex numbers, that's how it factors.

But how does that help me with the product over all k? Hmm, perhaps I can consider that the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to Φ₁₃(x), the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, since ω^k are the roots of x¹³ - 1 = 0, excluding x=1. Wait, actually, Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So yes, each ω^k for k=1 to 12 are the roots of Φ₁₃(x).

But wait, in my case, the product is over k=0 to 12, so when k=0, ω^0 = 1. So the term when k=0 is 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So the product is actually from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So now, I can write the product as:

P = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2)

Which, as I saw before, is the same as ∏_{k=1}^{12} ( (ω^k - (1 + i)) (ω^k - (1 - i)) )

So, P = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) * ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))

Now, each of these products is similar to evaluating Φ₁₃(x) at x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, because Φ₁₃(x) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x - ω^k). So, if I let f(x) = Φ₁₃(x), then:

∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - a) = f(a), where a is a constant. Wait, no, actually, Φ₁₃(x) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x - ω^k). So, ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - a) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} ( - (a - ω^k) ) = (-1)^{12} * ∏_{k=1}^{12} (a - ω^k) = Φ₁₃(a).

Since 12 is even, (-1)^12 is 1. So, ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - a) = Φ₁₃(a). Therefore, in my case, both products are Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i). So,

P = Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i)

So, if I can compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i), then multiply them together, I'll get P.

Now, Φ₁₃(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Alternatively, it can be written as (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1). So, perhaps I can compute f(1 + i) and f(1 - i) by plugging into that expression.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me compute Φ₁₃(1 + i).

Let me compute (1 + i)^13 first, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, note that 1 + i has a
