Okay, so I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break down the problem. First, N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N (let's call them d1, d2, d3, d4), if I replace d1 with 1, the number is divisible by 7; same for d2, d3, d4.

Wait, but changing a digit to 1 could mean replacing the thousands digit, hundreds digit, tens digit, or units digit. So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these must be divisible by 7.

I think the strategy is to find the largest N (four-digit) such that all four possibilities above are divisible by 7.

But how do I approach this? Maybe I can model this with some equations.

Let me denote the four-digit number as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number.

When we change a to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let’s call this number N1.

Similarly, changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let’s call this N2.

Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let’s call this N3.

Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, let me write these congruences:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod7

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

I can compute 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7 to simplify these.

Let me calculate:

1000 ÷7: 7*142=994, 1000-994=6, so 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 ÷7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 ÷7: 10-7=3, so 10≡3 mod7.

1 mod7 is 1.

So substituting these into the equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7

4. 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7

So now I have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7 --> (2b +3c +d) ≡1 mod7 (because 6 ≡6, so 6 + ... ≡0 → ... ≡1 mod7)

Wait, wait: 6 + (2b +3c +d) ≡0 mod7 → (2b +3c +d) ≡ -6 mod7 → which is same as 1 mod7.

Similarly for the others.

Let me rewrite all four:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7 → 6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7 (since 2 ≡2, so 2 → -5 mod7? Wait, 6a +3c +d ≡-2 mod7 → which is 5 mod7.

Wait, wait: 6a +3c +d +2 ≡0 mod7 → 6a +3c +d ≡-2 mod7 → -2 mod7 is 5. So yes, 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

3. 6a + 2b +3 + d ≡0 mod7 → 6a +2b +d ≡-3 mod7 → which is 4 mod7.

4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 → 6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7 → which is 6 mod7.

So now the four congruences are:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 -- equation (1)

2. 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 -- equation (2)

3. 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 -- equation (3)

4. 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 -- equation (4)

Hmm, this is a system of four congruences with variables a, b, c, d.

Since a, b, c, d are digits (a from 1-9, others 0-9), maybe I can find relationships between them.

Let me see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

For example, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - equation (1):

(6a +3c +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡5 -1 mod7

Which is 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Simplify:

6a -2b ≡4 mod7

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, so 2 has an inverse modulo7, which is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So multiply both sides by 4:

(6a -2b)*4 ≡4*4 mod7 → (24a -8b) ≡16 mod7.

24 mod7 is 3 (7*3=21, 24-21=3), 8 mod7 is1, 16 mod7 is 2 (7*2=14, 16-14=2).

So equation becomes: 3a -1b ≡2 mod7 → 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

So, 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Let me write this as equation (5):

5. 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

Equation (3) - equation (1):

(6a +2b +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡4 -1 mod7.

Simplify: 6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3. 3 and7 are coprime, inverse of3 mod7 is5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by5:

(6a -3c)*5 ≡3*5 mod7.

6*5=30≡2 mod7, 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So,

2a -1c ≡1 mod7.

So equation (6):

6. 2a - c ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (4):

Equation (4) - equation (2):

(6a +2b +3c) - (6a +3c +d) ≡6 -5 mod7.

Simplify: 2b -d ≡1 mod7.

So equation (7):

7. 2b - d ≡1 mod7.

Wait, but equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

If I can express d in terms of other variables, maybe.

From equation (7): 2b - d ≡1 mod7 → d ≡2b -1 mod7.

So d is congruent to 2b -1 mod7.

But d is a digit, so 0 ≤ d ≤9.

Now, from equation (1):

2b +3c + d ≡1 mod7.

But d ≡2b -1 mod7, so substitute:

2b +3c + (2b -1) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

(2b +2b) +3c -1 ≡1 mod7 → 4b +3c ≡2 mod7.

So equation (8):

8. 4b +3c ≡2 mod7.

From equation (6): 2a - c ≡1 mod7 → c ≡2a -1 mod7.

So c is congruent to 2a -1 mod7.

Substitute c into equation (8):

4b +3*(2a -1) ≡2 mod7.

Compute 3*(2a-1) =6a -3.

So, 4b +6a -3 ≡2 mod7 → 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

Hmm, because 2 +3 is 5? Wait, 4b +6a -3 ≡2 mod7 → 6a +4b ≡2 +3 mod7 → 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

So equation (9):

9. 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

Also, equation (5): 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

So I have equation (5) and equation (9).

Let me write equation (5) and equation (9):

5. 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

9. 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

Let me solve these two equations.

From equation (5): 3a - b ≡2 → b ≡3a -2 mod7.

Substitute b into equation (9):

6a +4*(3a -2) ≡5 mod7.

Compute 4*(3a -2) =12a -8.

So, 6a +12a -8 ≡5 mod7.

12a mod7: 12 ÷7 is 1 with remainder5, so 12a≡5a.

Similarly, 8 mod7 is1.

So equation becomes:

6a +5a -1 ≡5 mod7 → 11a -1 ≡5 mod7.

11 mod7 is4, so:

4a -1 ≡5 mod7 →4a ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of4 mod7. Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, inverse is2.

So, 4a ≡6 → a ≡6*2 mod7 → a≡12 mod7 → a≡5 mod7.

So a ≡5 mod7. But a is a digit from1-9, so possible values are5 and12, but 12 isn't a digit, so a=5.

So a=5.

Then, from equation (5): b ≡3a -2 mod7.

a=5, so 3*5=15, 15-2=13. 13 mod7 is6.

So b ≡6 mod7. So possible values for b are6 and13, but 13 is invalid, so b=6.

So b=6.

From equation (6): c ≡2a -1 mod7.

a=5, 2*5=10, 10-1=9, 9 mod7 is2. So c≡2 mod7.

So c can be2 or
