Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, so first, the problem is about counting the number of solutions to a system of equations with constraints on a, b, c. They are nonnegative integers, so that's important. The equations are a linear one and a nonlinear one.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find the number of (a, b, c) triples that satisfy both.

First, let's consider equation 2. It looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it or find some symmetry.

Looking at equation 2: it's a sum of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. So, for each pair of variables, say a and b, we have a²b + ab². Similarly for the other pairs.

Wait, so equation 2 can be written as the sum over all distinct pairs (a, b), (a, c), (b, c) of (a²b + ab²). So, for each pair, it's symmetric in the two variables.

Alternatively, equation 2 can be expressed as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c).

Yes, because a²b + ab² = ab(a + b), and similarly for the others.

So, equation 2: ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can express a + b as 300 - c, and similarly for the others.

So, substituting a + b = 300 - c into equation 2:

ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 6,000,000.

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, let's see another approach.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ac, and Q = abc.

Wait, but in equation 2, I have terms like a²b + a²c which is a²(b + c). Since b + c = 300 - a, this becomes a²(300 - a). Similarly for the other terms.

So, equation 2 can be rewritten as:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly for b and c.

So, equation 2 becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Which can be rearranged as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, P, Q.

Given that S = a + b + c = 300, and P = ab + bc + ac, and Q = abc.

We know that a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P.

Similarly, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3Q.

So, substituting these into the equation:

300(S² - 2P) - (S³ - 3SP + 3Q) = 6,000,000.

Now, plug in S = 300:

300(300² - 2P) - (300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute S² = 300² = 90,000.

So, 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600P.

Next, compute S³ = 300³ = 27,000,000.

Then, 3SP = 3*300*P = 900P.

So, S³ - 3SP + 3Q = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.

Putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600P - [27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Simplify the expression inside the brackets:

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Simplify term by term:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0.

-600P + 900P = 300P.

-3Q.

So, overall: 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now, I have another relation involving P and Q.

But I also know that in the theory of symmetric sums, for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are S, P, Q.

But given that S, P, Q must satisfy certain conditions for a, b, c to be nonnegative integers.

I wonder if I can find P in terms of S and perhaps some other constraints.

Wait, but S is fixed at 300, so perhaps I can find the possible range of P and Q.

But given that Q = 100P - 2,000,000, and Q must be nonnegative because a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so Q ≥ 0.

Thus, 100P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 → P ≥ 20,000.

Similarly, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P cannot be more than (300^2)/3, which is 30,000, because the maximum P occurs when two variables are as large as possible and the third is as small as possible.

Wait, let me think. The maximum of P occurs when two variables are equal and the third is zero. So, for example, if c = 0, then a + b = 300, and P = ab + 0 + 0 = ab.

The maximum value of ab when a + b = 300 is when a = b = 150, so ab = 150*150 = 22,500. So, maximum P is 22,500.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, if all three variables are positive, then P can be higher? Or not?

Wait, actually, when all three variables are positive, the maximum of P occurs when all three are as equal as possible. Let me check.

If a, b, c are equal, each is 100, so P = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 3*10,000=30,000. So, that's the maximum possible P.

Wait, that makes sense because when variables are spread out, the products can be larger.

So, P can range from 0 up to 30,000.

But given that Q = 100P - 2,000,000, and Q must be nonnegative, because it's the product of three nonnegative integers, so Q ≥ 0.

Thus, 100P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 → P ≥ 20,000.

But earlier, I thought P can be at most 30,000.

Wait, so P must satisfy 20,000 ≤ P ≤ 30,000.

Hmm, that's a narrow range. So, P is between 20,000 and 30,000.

But since a, b, c are integers, P must also be such that Q is an integer, but since Q is 100P - 2,000,000, which is 100*(P - 20,000), so Q is a multiple of 100.

But perhaps more importantly, since Q is the product of three nonnegative integers, it must be nonnegative, which is already satisfied.

So, now, let's think about the possible values of P.

So, 20,000 ≤ P ≤ 30,000.

But since P must be an integer, because a, b, c are integers, so P is an integer between 20,000 and 30,000, inclusive.

But wait, not every integer in that range is possible, because P is the sum of products of pairs of a, b, c, so it's subject to certain constraints based on the values of a, b, c.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better.

We have three variables a, b, c, with a + b + c = 300, and we're looking for triples where a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Alternatively, we can think of this as a symmetric equation, so perhaps we can assume without loss of generality that a ≤ b ≤ c, count the number of such triples, and then multiply by the number of permutations.

But that might complicate things because we have to handle different cases.

Alternatively, perhaps think of substituting variables.

Wait, let's go back to the equation for Q:

Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, since Q = abc must be a nonnegative integer, and so must be P.

So, 100P must be equal to Q + 2,000,000.

But perhaps we can find the possible values of P and Q.

Wait, but since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and S = 300, P = ab + bc + ac, and Q = abc.

Given that, perhaps we can consider the symmetric functions.

Alternatively, perhaps using the idea of Vieta's formula, treating a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation.

So, if a, b, c are roots of x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0, which would be x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps think of (a + b + c) = 300, and we have another equation involving P and Q.

Let me see, from the equation above, we have:

Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Now, since Q = abc, and a, b, c are nonnegative integers, we can also think of the variables a, b, c as satisfying the equation abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

But perhaps another way is to consider that in equation 2, we have:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Which, as we saw earlier, is equal to ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c).

But since a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c, etc.

So, substituting, we get:

ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

ab*300 - ab c + ac*300 - a c b + bc*300 - b c a.

Wait, but this seems a bit messy. Let me compute each term:

= 300ab - abc + 300ac - abc + 300bc - abc.

So, combining like terms:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc.

Which is 300P - 3Q.

So, 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000.

Which brings us back to where we were earlier.

So, that's consistent.

So, we have Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, now, since Q = abc, which is a nonnegative integer.

Given that, and since P = ab + bc + ac, which is also a nonnegative integer.

So, to recap: a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ac = P, abc = Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, the question is now, for nonnegative integers a, b, c, how many triples (a, b, c) satisfy these.

Hmm, perhaps we can model this as a system where we're trying to find all triples of nonnegative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ac = P, and abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

But P can vary, but it's constrained by 20,000 ≤ P ≤ 30,000, as before.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a system where for each possible P, Q is determined, and then we can find the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ac = P, and abc = Q.

But that seems complicated because P is not fixed, but varies in a range.

Wait, but perhaps we can think of it as a cubic equation, treating a, b, c as roots of the equation x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0, so x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0.

Given that, and knowing that Q = 100P - 2,000,000, the equation becomes:

x³ - 300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor terms with P:

x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000 + P(x - 100) = 0.

Hmm, so for each P, this equation must have three nonnegative integer roots a, b, c.

But since P itself is related to the roots, this seems a bit recursive.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor this equation.

Wait, let me try to rearrange the equation:

x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000 = -P(x - 100).

So,

x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000 = -P(x - 100).

But since a, b, c are roots, x = a, x = b, x = c must satisfy this.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation, so substituting x = a, we get:

a³ - 300a² + Pa - Q = 0.

But since Q = 100P - 2,000,000, plugging that in:

a³ - 300a² + Pa - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Which simplifies to:

a³ - 300a² + Pa - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor out P:

a³ - 300a² + 2,000,000 + P(a - 100) = 0.

Similarly, for x = b and x = c, we have:

b³ - 300b² + 2,000,000 + P(b - 100) = 0.

c³ - 300c² + 2,000,000 + P(c - 100) = 0.

So, for each root, this equation holds.

But since P is the same for all, perhaps we can find a relationship between a, b, and c.

Wait, perhaps it's possible that one of the variables is 100.

Wait, let me test that. Suppose that a = 100.

Then, a = 100, so from a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 200.

From P = ab + bc + ac, when a = 100, P = 100b + 100c + bc.

Which can be written as P = 100(b + c) + bc = 100*200 + bc = 20,000 + bc.

Similarly, Q = abc = 100*b*c.

Given that Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So substituting Q and P:

100*b*c = 100*(20,000 + bc) - 2,000,000.

Simplify:

100bc = 2,000,000 + 100bc - 2,000,000.

Wait, that's 100bc = 2,000,000 + 100bc - 2,000,000.

Which simplifies to 100bc = 100bc.

Hmm, that's an identity. So, that doesn't give us any new information.

So, if a = 100, then P = 20,000 + bc, Q = 100bc, and the equation Q = 100P - 2,000,000 holds.

So, in this case, a = 100, and b + c = 200.

So, in this scenario, for any b and c such that b + c = 200, and bc can be any integer, then the conditions are satisfied.

But wait, the problem is that a, b, c must be nonnegative integers.

So, in this case, a is fixed at 100, and b and c can be any nonnegative integers such that b + c = 200.

So, how many such pairs (b, c) are there? For nonnegative integers, it's 201 possibilities (b can be 0 to 200, and c=200 - b).

Each such pair gives a unique triple (100, b, c), so 201 triples where a = 100.

Similarly, we can consider the cases where b = 100 or c = 100.

But wait, but if a = 100, then in the triple, the other two variables can be anything adding up to 200. Similarly, if b = 100, then a + c = 200, and same for c = 100.

But wait, are these cases overlapping?

For example, if all three are 100: a = b = c = 100, then that's counted in each of the three cases.

So, perhaps when we consider all three cases where a, b, or c is 100, the total number of triples would be 3*201 - 3*1 + 1? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it correctly.

Each case where one variable is 100 gives 201 triples, but if two variables are 100, that's overlapping.

Wait, for example, when a=100 and b=100, then c=100, which is the triple (100,100,100). So, when we count a=100, we include all b and c such that b + c = 200, including when b=100 and c=100. Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

So, when we count all three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100), each of the 201 triples is counted once, except for the case where two variables are 100, which would have been counted in two different cases, and the case where all three are 100, which is counted three times.

But in reality, the triple (100,100,100) is only one unique triple. Similarly, triples where two variables are 100 are only one unique triple each.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the total number of triples where at least one variable is 100, but that might complicate inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps in our initial assumption, we can assume that exactly one variable is 100, and the others are not, but that might not capture all possibilities.

Wait, but earlier, when a=100, we found that any b and c such that b + c = 200 would satisfy the conditions, regardless of whether b or c is 100.

So, perhaps the only constraints are that a=100, and b + c=200. So, all such triples satisfy the equations.

Similarly, if b=100, then a + c=200, and same for c=100. So, each of these cases contributes 201 triples, but when two variables are 100, they are counted twice, and when all three are 100, they are counted three times.

So, to avoid overcounting, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion.

Compute the total number of triples where a=100 OR b=100 OR c=100.

The formula is |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

Where A is the set of triples where a=100, B where b=100, C where c=100.

So, |A| = |B| = |C| = 201.

|A ∩ B| is the set of triples where a=100 and b=100. Then, c=300 - 100 - 100=100. So, only one triple: (100,100,100).

Similarly, |A ∩ C| = 1 and |B ∩ C| =1.

And |A ∩ B ∩ C| =1.

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = 201 + 201 + 201 -1 -1 -1 +1 = 603 -3 +1=601.

So, 601 triples where at least one variable is 100.

But wait, does this mean that all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100?

Wait, because earlier, when we considered a=100, we found that any b and c such that b + c=200 would satisfy the equations. But what about cases where none of a, b, c is 100? Would they also satisfy the equations?

Hmm, so perhaps I need to check if there are solutions where none of a, b, c is 100.

Wait, let's suppose that none of a, b, c is 100. Then, from the equation Q = 100P - 2,000,000, and Q = abc.

But if none of a, b, c is 100, then perhaps I can find such a triple.

Wait, but let's think about the equation 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, if none of a, b, c is 100, then perhaps substituting variables.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that one of the variables is 100 because of the equation.

Wait, let me think: from the equation Q = 100P - 2,000,000, which can be written as Q + 2,000,000 = 100P.

So, 100 divides (Q + 2,000,000). Since Q is abc, which is a product of three integers, Q is an integer, so 100 divides (abc + 2,000,000).

But 2,000,000 is 20,000 * 100, so 100 divides 2,000,000.

Thus, 100 divides Q as well, because 100 divides (Q + 2,000,000) and 100 divides 2,000,000, so their difference, Q, must also be divisible by 100.

So, abc must be divisible by 100.

Which suggests that at least one of a, b, c must be a multiple of 4 or 25, or multiples of 2 and 5.

But perhaps more importantly, since Q must be a multiple of 100, which is 2² *5².

So, the product abc must have at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5.

But perhaps that doesn't necessarily require any single variable to be 100, but rather that the product has those factors.

But perhaps that's a tangent.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think that if none of a, b, c is 100, then perhaps the equation still holds.

Wait, let's test a specific case where a, b, c are all different from 100.

For example, let me take a=100, b=100, c=100. Then, a + b + c=300.

Then, P = ab + bc + ac = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 30,000.

Q = abc = 1,000,000.

So, 100P - Q = 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000. Which matches.

But I need to see if there are other solutions.

Let me suppose that a=200, b=100, c=0.

Then, a + b + c=300.

Compute P = ab + bc + ac = 200*100 + 100*0 + 200*0 = 20,000.

Q = abc = 200*100*0=0.

So, 100P - Q = 100*20,000 - 0 = 2,000,000, which matches.

So, this is another solution where none of the variables is 100 except b.

Wait, but in this case, b is 100.

Hmm, so perhaps in all cases where one variable is 100, the equations are satisfied.

But what about a case where none is 100? For example, let me try a=150, b=150, c=0.

Then, a + b + c=300.

Compute P=ab + bc + ac=150*150 + 150*0 + 150*0=22,500.

Q=abc=150*150*0=0.

Then, 100P - Q=100*22,500 -0=2,250,000, which is more than 2,000,000.

So, that doesn't satisfy the equation.

Another example: a=200, b=50, c=50.

Sum: 200+50+50=300.

P = ab + bc + ac=200*50 +50*50 +200*50=10,000 +2,500 +10,000=22,500.

Q=200*50*50=500,000.

100P - Q=2,250,000 -500,000=1,750,000, which is less than 2,000,000. So, doesn't satisfy.

Hmm.

Another example: a=120, b=90, c=90.

Sum: 120+90+90=300.

P=ab + bc + ac=120*90 +90*90 +120*90=10,800 +8,100 +10,800=29,700.

Q=120*90*90=97,200.

100P - Q=2,970,000 -97,200=2,872,800, which is way more than 2,000,000.

Hmm, not matching.

Another example: a=100, b=100, c=100.

We already saw that it's a solution.

What about a=150, b=100, c=50.

Sum=300.

P=150*100 +100*50 +150*50=15,000 +5,000 +7,500=27,500.

Q=150*100*50=750,000.

100P - Q=2,750,000 -750,000=2,000,000.

So, this triple satisfies the equation.

But in this case, a=150, b=100, c=50. So, one variable is 100.

Similarly, another example: a=200, b=100, c=0. Which also satisfies, as we saw earlier.

So, from these examples, it seems that whenever one of the variables is 100, the equation is satisfied.

But wait, when I took a=100, then b + c=200, and for any b and c adding up to 200, the equations are satisfied.

But when I tried a triple where none of the variables is 100, like a=120, b=90, c=90, the equation does not hold.

So, perhaps the only solutions are those where at least one variable is 100.

If that's the case, then all solutions are the triples where at least one of a, b, c is 100, and the other two add up to 200.

Thus, the number of such triples is 3*201 - 3 +1=601.

Wait, 3*201 because for each of a, b, c being 100, there are 201 possibilities (the other two variables can be 0 to 200, but adding to 200).

But when two variables are 100, we have to subtract overlaps, and when all three are 100, we have to adjust.

Wait, let's recast it.

Number of triples where a=100: 201 (since b + c =200, with b and c nonnegative integers).

Similarly for b=100: 201, and c=100:201.

But when we add them up, 201*3=603.

But this counts the cases where two variables are 100 twice.

For example, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, once in each set.

Similarly, triples where two variables are 100, like (100,100,100) or (100,100,100) etc., but wait, actually, for two variables being 100, the third must be 100 as well because 100 + 100 + x = 300 → x=100. So, the only triple where two variables are 100 is (100,100,100).

Thus, the number of such cases is 1 (for each pair), but since all three are 100, they are counted three times in the initial count.

So, using inclusion-exclusion:

Total = (number with a=100) + (number with b=100) + (number with c=100) - (number with a=100 and b=100) - (number with a=100 and c=100) - (number with b=100 and c=100) + (number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100).

So, substituting:

Total = 201 + 201 + 201 - 1 -1 -1 +1.

Which is 603 -3 +1=601.

So, there are 601 triples where at least one variable is 100.

But wait, is that all the possible solutions?

Earlier, I thought that maybe if none of the variables is 100, the equation might not hold, but I need to verify if that's the case.

Suppose that none of a, b, c is 100. Then, let's assume that a, b, c are all different from 100. So, a ≠100, b≠100, c≠100.

But from the equation Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

But if none of a, b, c is 100, then perhaps I can think of the cubic equation.

Wait, we had earlier the equation:

x³ -300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) =0.

Let me assume that none of a, b, c is 100. Then, perhaps 100 is not a root.

Wait, but if 100 is not a root, then perhaps I can factor the cubic equation.

But wait, the cubic equation is:

x³ -300x² + Px -100P + 2,000,000 =0.

Hmm, but without knowing more about P, it's hard to factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000 = -P(x -100).

But if 100 is not a root, then x ≠100, so I can write:

P = -(x³ -300x² +2,000,000)/(x -100).

But since P must be an integer, because it's ab + bc + ac, which is the sum of products of integers, so P must be integer.

So, for each x (a root), the RHS must be integer.

So, perhaps, if x is not 100, then (x³ -300x² +2,000,000) must be divisible by (x -100).

But wait, by polynomial division, if I divide x³ -300x² +2,000,000 by (x -100), what's the remainder?

Using the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when dividing by (x - k) is f(k), where f(x) is the polynomial.

So, f(100) = 100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 2,000,000.

Compute f(100):

100³ = 1,000,000.

300*(100)^2=300*10,000=3,000,000.

So, f(100) = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 0.

So, (x -100) is a factor of the polynomial x³ -300x² +2,000,000.

So, the polynomial factors as (x -100)(x² -200x + 20,000).

Because:

(x -100)(x² -200x + 20,000) = x³ -200x² +20,000x -100x² +20,000x -2,000,000.

Wait, let me compute:

(x -100)(x² -200x + 20,000) = x³ -200x² +20,000x -100x² +20,000x -2,000,000.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute it step by step.

Multiply (x -100) by (x² -200x + 20,000):

= x*(x² -200x +20,000) -100*(x² -200x +20,000)
= x³ -200x² +20,000x -100x² +20,000x -2,000,000
= x³ - (200+100)x² + (20,000 +20,000)x -2,000,000
= x³ -300x² +40,000x -2,000,000.

Wait, but the original polynomial is x³ -300x² +2,000,000.

So, that doesn't match. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to perform polynomial long division.

Divide x³ -300x² +2,000,000 by (x -100).

Let me do that:

Divide x³ -300x² +0x +2,000,000 by (x -100).

First term: x³ ÷ x = x².

Multiply (x -100) by x²: x³ -100x².

Subtract: (x³ -300x²) - (x³ -100x²) = (-300x² +100x²) = -200x².

Bring down the next term: -200x² +0x.

Next term: -200x² ÷x = -200x.

Multiply (x -100) by -200x: -200x² +20,000x.

Subtract: (-200x² +0x) - (-200x² +20,000x) = 0x² -20,000x.

Bring down the next term: -20,000x + 2,000,000.

Next term: -20,000x ÷x = -20,000.

Multiply (x -100) by -20,000: -20,000x +2,000,000.

Subtract: (-20,000x +2,000,000) - (-20,000x +2,000,000) = 0.

So, the division yields x² -200x -20,000.

So, x³ -300x² +2,000,000 = (x -100)(x² -200x -20,000).

Wait, check:

(x -100)(x² -200x -20,000) = x³ -200x² -20,000x -100x² +20,000x +2,000,000.

Simplify:

x³ -300x² +0x +2,000,000.

Yes, that matches.

So, the polynomial factors as (x -100)(x² -200x -20,000) = 0.

So, the roots are x=100 and the roots of x² -200x -20,000 =0.

Solve x² -200x -20,000=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [200 ± sqrt(200² +4*20,000)] /2.

Compute discriminant:

200² =40,000.

4*20,000=80,000.

So, sqrt(40,000 +80,000)=sqrt(120,000)=sqrt(400*300)=20*sqrt(300)=20*sqrt(100*3)=20*10*sqrt(3)=200*sqrt(3).

So, x=(200 ±200√3)/2=100 ±100√3.

But √3 is approximately 1.732, so 100√3 ≈173.2.

Thus, the roots are approximately:

100 +173.2=273.2, and 100 -173.2≈-73.2.

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the only valid root from the quadratic is x=100 +100√3, but that's not an integer, and also greater than 300, which contradicts a + b + c=300.

Wait, 100 +100√3 ≈273.2, which is less than 300.

Wait, 100√3≈173.2, so 100 +173.2≈273.2.

So, x=273.2 is a root? But 273.2 is not an integer, and since a, b, c must be integers, this root is invalid.

Similarly, the other root is negative, which is invalid because a, b, c are nonnegative.

Therefore, the only integer root is x=100.

Thus, the only possible integer solutions are when at least one variable is 100.

Therefore, all triples (a, b, c) satisfying the given equations must have at least one of a, b, c equal to 100.

Thus, the number of such triples is the number of nonnegative integer solutions where at least one variable is 100, and the sum is 300.

Which, as calculated earlier, is 601.

Wait, but that seems high.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

If a=100, then b + c=200.

The number of nonnegative integer solutions for b and c is 201 (from (0,200) to (200,0)).

Similarly, for b=100, a + c=200, 201 solutions.

For c=100, a + b=200, 201 solutions.

But when we add these, we have 201*3=603.

But now, we have to subtract the cases where two variables are 100 because they are counted twice.

Each case where two variables are 100 occurs only once, because 100+100+x=300 → x=100. So, the triple is (100,100,100). So, there's only one such triple.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that when two variables are 100, the third is also 100. So, there's only one triple where all three are 100, which is counted three times in the initial count.

Wait, so in the inclusion-exclusion formula:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|.

Where |A| = |B| = |C|=201.

Each pairwise intersection |A∩B| is 1 (the triple (100,100,100)), same for |A∩C|=1 and |B∩C|=1.

And |A∩B∩C|=1.

So, substituting:

Total = 201 + 201 + 201 -1 -1 -1 +1 = 603 -3 +1=601.

Yes, so 601 is the total number of triples where at least one variable is 100.

Therefore, all solutions are captured by these triples, because we proved earlier that the only integer roots of the equation are x=100, and the other roots are non-integers or negative, which are invalid.

Thus, the number of triples (a, b, c) is 601.

Wait, but let me sanity check with another example. Suppose I take a triple where two variables are 100: a=100, b=100, c=100.

Which is counted once in |A∩B∩C|.

Similarly, a triple where only a=100, but b and c are not 100, is counted once in |A|, not in |B| or |C|.

So, the inclusion-exclusion counts all cases correctly.

Therefore, the answer should be 601.

Wait, but wait, let's think again. When a=100, then b + c=200, which includes cases where b=100, c=100, but also when b=0, c=200, etc.

So, in |A|, |B|, |C|, each includes cases where one of the variables is 100, but the other two can include another 100.

So, when we do inclusion-exclusion, the overlapping is only for the triple (100,100,100), as other overlaps are when two variables are 100 and the third is something else, but that's impossible because a + b + c=300 only allows the triple (100,100,100) when two are 100.

Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion formula is correctly applied, and the total number is 601.

So, I think the answer is 601.


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\).

First, we rewrite the second equation using symmetric sums:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c).
\]
Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(a + b = 300 - c\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(b + c = 300 - a\) into the equation:
\[
ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 6,000,000.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we find:
\[
300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]
Dividing by 3:
\[
100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]
Let \(P = ab + ac + bc\) and \(Q = abc\). Then:
\[
100P - Q = 2,000,000 \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q = 100P - 2,000,000.
\]
Since \(a, b, c\) are nonnegative integers, \(Q\) must be nonnegative, implying \(P \geq 20,000\).

Next, we analyze the polynomial whose roots are \(a, b, c\):
\[
x^3 - 300x^2 + Px - Q = 0.
\]
Substituting \(Q = 100P - 2,000,000\), the polynomial becomes:
\[
x^3 - 300x^2 + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.
\]
Factoring, we find that \(x = 100\) is a root. Thus, all solutions must have at least one of \(a, b, c\) equal to 100.

For each variable fixed at 100, the other two variables must sum to 200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions for each pair \((x, y)\) such that \(x + y = 200\) is 201. Since there are three variables, we initially count \(3 \times 201 = 603\) solutions. However, we must subtract overlaps where two variables are 100, which only occurs once for the triple \((100, 100, 100)\). Applying inclusion-exclusion, the total number of solutions is:
\[
603 - 3 + 1 = 601.
\]

Thus, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{601}\).
