Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, starting with Alice, and on each turn a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, I remember that in such games, the key is to figure out the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

So, maybe I should model this problem by determining for each n whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position. Since Alice goes first, if n is a winning position, Alice can win. But if n is a losing position, Bob can win. So I need to count all n ≤2024 where n is a losing position.

Let me think about how to model the positions. Let's consider small values of n first and see if I can spot a pattern.

Let's make a table:

n | Winning (W) or Losing (L)
--- | ---
0 | Losing (since no moves can be made, so the player to move loses)
1 | W (take 1 token, win)
2 | W (take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent who then takes it and wins, but wait, no—wait. Wait, no, if it's your turn and you take 1, opponent has 1 left. But opponent can take that last one and win. So maybe I miscalculated. Wait, let's step back.

Wait, n=0: no tokens, so the player to move loses. So n=0 is L.

n=1: current player can take 1 and win. So W.

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because there's only 2 tokens. So only option is to take 1, leaving n=1. But n=1 is a W position for the opponent. So n=2 is a losing position because whatever you do, the opponent can win. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, if n=2, you take
