Alright, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. I need to figure out how many ways I can fill each cell with a digit (0-9) such that two conditions are satisfied. First, reading the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Second, reading the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. The example given is helpful, but I need to understand the structure to solve it.

Let me start by visualizing the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. Let me denote the cells as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, reading left to right, the first number is formed by a, b, c, which is the top row. The second number is formed by d, e, f, the bottom row. So, the first condition is that the sum of these two 3-digit numbers is 999. 

The second condition is that reading top to bottom, each column forms a number. So, the first column is a and d, making a two-digit number; the second column is b and e, another two-digit number; and the third column is c and f, the third two-digit number. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

So, let's break down the problem. Let's denote the top row as ABC, which is a three-digit number, so mathematically, that's 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom row is DEF, which is 100d + 10e + f. According to the first condition, ABC + DEF = 999.

The second condition involves the columns. Column 1 is AD, which is 10a + d. Column 2 is BE, which is 10b + e. Column 3 is CF, which is 10c + f. Their sum should be 99, so (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me write down the equations:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Looking at equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

I can rearrange this as 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Which can be written as 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, perhaps I can let S = a + d, T = b + e, U = c + f. Then equation 1 becomes 100S + 10T + U = 999. Equation 2 is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99. But a + b + c is the sum of the top row digits, and d + e + f is the sum of the bottom row digits. Wait, but from equation 1, S = a + d, T = b + e, U = c + f. So, a + b + c = (a + b + c), and d + e + f = (d + e + f). Hmm, not sure if that's directly helpful.

Wait, another angle. Let me consider equation 1: 100S + 10T + U = 999, where S = a + d, T = b + e, U = c + f. Since 999 is a three-digit number, 100S + 10T + U must equal exactly 999. Let's think about what S, T, U can be.

Each of a, d is a single digit (0-9), so S = a + d can be from 0 + 0 = 0 up to 9 + 9 = 18. Similarly, T and U can each be from 0 to 18.

But 100S +10T + U = 999. So, let's see what S, T, U must be.

999 is equal to 9*100 + 9*10 + 9. So, 100S + 10T + U = 999 implies that:

100S = 900, so S = 9.

10T = 90, so T = 9.

U = 9.

So, S = a + d = 9, T = b + e = 9, U = c + f = 9.

So, each pair (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) must add up to 9. That's a crucial insight.

So, the problem reduces to:

- a + d = 9
- b + e = 9
- c + f = 9

Additionally, equation 2 must hold: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But from above, since a + d = 9, d = 9 - a.

Similarly, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c.

So, d + e + f = (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - (a + b + c).

So, equation 2 becomes:

10(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) = 99.

Let me compute that:

10P + (27 - P) = 99, where P = a + b + c.

So, 10P +27 - P = 99 → 9P +27 =99 → 9P =72 → P=8.

So, a + b + c =8.

So, now I have two key equations:

1. a + d =9 → d=9 - a
2. b + e =9 → e=9 - b
3. c + f =9 → f=9 - c
4. a + b + c =8

So, all variables are linked through these equations.

Now, my task is to find the number of possible assignments of digits (0-9) to a, b, c, d, e, f, such that the above four conditions are satisfied.

But since d, e, f are determined by a, b, c, I can focus on a, b, c, and then d, e, f will be uniquely determined as 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c respectively.

But we must ensure that all digits are valid (i.e., 0-9, so 9 - a, etc., must be between 0 and9). Since a, b, c are digits, so a, b, c ∈{0,1,...,9}, so 9 - a ∈{0,1,...,9}. So, no problem there.

So, the constraints are:

- a, b, c are digits (0-9)
- a + b + c =8

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where a, b, c are digits (i.e., 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤9), and then for each such solution, d =9 -a, e=9 - b, f=9 - c are determined, which will also be digits (since a, b, c ≤9, so 9 - a, etc., ≥0). So, no further constraints needed on d, e, f.

Therefore, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where each variable is between 0 and9.

Wait, but since 8 is less than 9, and a, b, c are non-negative integers, all solutions will automatically satisfy a, b, c ≤8, which is less than 9, so the upper limit of 9 doesn't affect. So, the number of solutions is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8. 

The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xn =k is C(k + n -1, n-1). So here, n=3, k=8.

Number of solutions = C(8 +3 -1, 3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

But wait, are there any constraints that a, b, c must be digits, i.e., 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤9? Well, since 8 is less than 9, each of a, b, c can be at most 8, which is less than 9, so all solutions are valid. So, the answer is 45. So, 45 ways.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify this. Each a, b, c is a digit, so 0-9, but since a + b + c =8, each of a, b, c can be from 0 to8, because if, say, a were 9, then b + c would have to be -1, which is impossible. So, no, a, b, c cannot exceed 8, and since 8 is less than 9, all solutions are allowed. So, 45 is correct.

Wait, but the example given in the problem has a=0, b=0, c=8, and d=9, e=9, f=1. So, that's one of the 45 possible. So, the count is 45.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me think about the variables a, b, c. Each can be from 0 to8, but is there any issue if, say, a=9?

No, because a can't be 9 as a + b + c=8, so a is max 8.

So, all 45 solutions are valid, leading to 45 possible grids.

Wait, but wait a second. Are all these 45 grids unique? Because d, e, f are uniquely determined by a, b, c, so yes, each solution (a,b,c) leads to a unique grid.

Wait, but let me consider if any of d, e, f could be non-digits, but as I saw earlier, since a, b, c are at most 8, d=9 -a will be at least 1, which is okay because digits can be 0-9. Wait, no, actually, a can be 9, but in our case, a can't be 9 because a + b + c=8. So, a is at most 8, so d is 9 - a, so d is at least 1. So, d, e, f are at least 1, but digits can be zero as well. Wait, but in the example, d is 9, e is9, f is1. So, if a=0, then d=9, which is allowed. Similarly, if a=8, d=1. So, all d, e, f are between 1 and9, which are valid digits. So, no issue.

So, that seems okay. So, 45 is the number of possible grids.

Wait, but I should think again. The example given in the problem is:

a=0, b=0, c=8

d=9, e=9, f=1

Which satisfies a + b + c = 0 +0 +8=8, and a + d=9, b + e=9, c +f=9, as required.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the number of possible grids is 45.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure that each of a, b, c is a digit. For example, suppose a=8, b=0, c=0. Then d=1, e=9, f=9.

But wait, in the grid, the top row is a, b, c. So, when a=8, b=0, c=0, the top row is 800. The bottom row is d, e, f =1,9,9, so the bottom row is 199.

Sum: 800 +199=999, which is correct.

Sum of columns: (10a +d)=80 +1=81, (10b +e)=09, (10c +f)=09. So, 81 +9 +9=99, correct.

Another example: a=1, b=2, c=5. Then d=8, e=7, f=4.

Top row: 125, bottom row:874.

125 +874=999. Correct.

Columns: a+d=1+8=9, 10a +d=18; b +e=2+7=9, 10b +e=27; c +f=5+4=9, 10c +f=54.

18 +27 +54=99. Correct.

So, seems okay.

So, 45 is the correct count.

Therefore, the answer is 45, which is 45 ways.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99.

We denote the grid cells as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

### Key Equations:
1. The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows:
   \[
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
   \]
   From this, we deduce:
   \[
   a + d = 9, \quad b + e = 9, \quad c + f = 9
   \]

2. The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns:
   \[
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
   \]
   Substituting \(d = 9 - a\), \(e = 9 - b\), and \(f = 9 - c\), we get:
   \[
   10(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) = 99
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99 \implies a + b + c = 8
   \]

### Solution:
We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to \(a + b + c = 8\), where \(a, b, c\) are digits (0-9). Since 8 is less than 9, all solutions are valid. The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars theorem:
\[
\binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
\]

Each solution for \(a, b, c\) uniquely determines \(d, e, f\) as \(d = 9 - a\), \(e = 9 - b\), and \(f = 9 - c\). Therefore, there are 45 valid grids.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]
