Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about this. It's a combinatorial game, so maybe I can model it using something like the Sprague-Grundy theorem or look for a pattern in the winning and losing positions.

Let me start by considering small values of n and see who would win in those cases. Maybe a pattern will emerge.

For n=1: Alice takes the last token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, but wait. Wait, no, Alice goes first. So if n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1, then Bob takes 1 and wins. But wait, that would mean Bob wins. Or does Alice have another move? Wait, no, because from n=2, Alice can only take 1 or 4, but 4 is more than 2. So she takes 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So for n=2, Alice can't win, so Bob can win. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in n=2, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last one. So Bob can win, so n=2 is a winning position for Bob? Or does it mean that n=2 is a losing position for Alice?

Wait, maybe I should model this as a series of positions where each position is either a winning (N-position) or losing (P-position) position for the player about to move.

Let me try to list the positions from n=0 upwards.

n=0: No tokens. The game is over, so the player who just moved wins. But since no tokens are left, the player to move cannot make a move, so n=0 is a losing position (P-position).

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position (N-position).

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent,
