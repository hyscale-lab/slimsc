Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. The question asks for the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, we have to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. Since the sides aren't equal, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC, so all three vertices lie on ω.

The tangents at B and C meet at D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. Anyway, D is the ex-pole with respect to triangle ABC, I think. Also, since D lies on the tangents at B and C, DB and DC are tangent to the circle ω.

Then, we draw the line AD, which intersects the circle ω again at point P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with ω.

Our goal is to find AP.

Let me note down the given lengths: AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. So, sides are 5, 9, 10. Let me check if this is a valid triangle. The sum of any two sides should be greater than the third. 5 + 9 = 14 > 10, 5 +10=15>9, 9+10=19>5. So, yes, it's a valid triangle.

Maybe it's a right-angled triangle? Let me check using the Pythagorean theorem. 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106. 10² is 100. Not equal, so it's not a right-angled triangle. Similarly, 5² + 10² = 125 > 9²=81, so no. So, it's an acute or obtuse triangle.

Wait, maybe we can compute angles or other properties to help us later.

But before that, let's think about the properties related to the tangent points and point D.

I recall that the tangent from a point to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, DB is tangent at B, so DB is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω. Similarly, DC is tangent at C, so DC is perpendicular to OC.

Also, since D is the intersection of two tangents, it's the ex-pole with respect to triangle ABC. And, in such cases, D is called the exsimilicenter or something? Wait, maybe it's the ex-pole with respect to BC. Hmm, perhaps I should look for properties related to D.

Alternatively, since DB and DC are tangents, DB = DC because the lengths of tangents from the same external point to a circle are equal. So, DB = DC. That seems useful.

So, triangle DB C is isoceles with DB = DC.

Also, line AD passes through the circle again at P. So, AP is a chord of the circle, and we can perhaps use power of a point or something related.

Wait, Power of a Point seems promising here. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the points where any line through D intersects the circle.

So, in this case, since D is outside ω, and AD intersects ω at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

Because DB is the tangent, so power of D is DB² = DA * DP.

So, that gives us:

DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = AD - DP (wait, no, AP is from A to P, which is along AD. So, actually, AP = AD - PD? Wait, no, because P is beyond A? Or is P between A and D?

Wait, let me correct that. The line AD intersects ω again at P. So, the order is A, then P, then D. So, A is on the circle, then P is the second intersection, then D is outside. So, the points on AD are A, P, D, in that order.

Wait, no. Wait, when you have a line from D to A, it enters the circle at P (since A is already on the circle), so the order is D outside, then P, then A on the circle. So, the path is D -> P -> A.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, since A is a vertex of the triangle and the circle is the circumcircle, so A is on the circle. So, the line AD starts at D, goes through A, and then continues to P, which is another intersection point. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it says "AD" intersects ω at P, so maybe A is one point, and P is the other. So, AD starts at A, goes through D, and then exits at P? No, that's not possible because A is on the circle, and D is outside. So, line AD starts at A, goes to D, but D is outside, so the other intersection point would be beyond D? Wait, no, the line from A to D would first intersect the circle at A and then go to D, so P must be the other point beyond A? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the positions. Let me think: point D is outside the circle because it's the intersection of two tangents. So, line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes towards D (outside the circle), and intersects the circle again at P on the way to D. So, the order is A, then P, then D.

So, AP is the segment from A to P, which is inside the circle, and PD is from P to D outside. So, in terms of lengths, AD = AP + PD.

So, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DA * DP.

But DA is the length from D to A, which is equal to AP + PD. Wait, but wait, the Power of a Point formula says that for point D outside the circle, and a secant D-P-A, then DP * DA = DB². Wait, no, more accurately, the power is DP * DA' where A' is the other intersection point. But if the line passes through A and P, and since A is on the circle, then DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, but since P is inside the circle? Wait, no, P is on the circle, right? Wait, no. Wait, A is on the circle, and P is another point where AD intersects the circle. So, if we go from D to A, the line passes through P on its way to A, since A is on the circle.

Wait, maybe it
