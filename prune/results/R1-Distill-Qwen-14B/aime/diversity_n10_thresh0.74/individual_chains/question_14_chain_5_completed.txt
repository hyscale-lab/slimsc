Okay, so I need to solve this math problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand it.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number. Let me represent it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits, right? And N is the largest such number with the given property.

The key property here is that if any single digit is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, changing A to 1 gives a number 1BCD, which should be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which should be divisible by 7, and so on for C and D.

I need to find the largest such N. Then, once I have N, I divide it by 1000 to get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder), and sum Q and R.

First, let's think about the structure of N. Since N is a four-digit number, A can't be zero. So A is from 1 to 9, and B, C, D are from 0 to 9.

The problem states that changing any digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. That implies that the original number N must have some relationship with 7 as well, but it's not directly stated whether N is divisible by 7 or not. Wait, let me check.

Wait, the problem doesn't say that N is divisible by 7. It says that changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. So N itself might not be divisible by 7. Interesting.

So, for each digit position, when we change that digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, for example, the number after changing A to 1 is 1BCD, which is divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which is divisible by 7, and so on.

I think we can model this by considering each possible digit change and setting up congruences modulo 7.

Let me think about how changing a digit affects the number. For example, changing the thousands digit A to 1: the original number is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Changing A to 1 gives 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. So, (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, changing B to 1: the number becomes 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D, which is 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. So, (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Same for changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

And changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, we have four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

And of course, the original number N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

We need to find the largest N such that all four of these conditions hold. Then, find Q + R where Q = N // 1000 and R = N % 1000.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to compute the congruences for each condition.

But first, let me compute what 1000, 100, 10, and 1 are modulo 7, because that might simplify things.

Compute:

1000 mod 7: 1000 / 7 is 142 * 7 = 994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 mod 7: 100 / 7 is 14 * 7 = 98, remainder 2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7: 10 - 7 = 3. So 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

1 mod 7: 1.

So, now we can rewrite each condition:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So now, we have the four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, let's denote these four equations as Eq1, Eq2, Eq3, Eq4.

Our goal is to find A, B, C, D (digits, with A from 1-9, others 0-9) such that all four equations are satisfied, and N = ABCD is as large as possible.

Moreover, since we want the largest N, we should try to maximize A first, then B, then C, then D.

But since each digit affects multiple equations, we need to find a way to solve these equations step by step.

Let me see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

For example, subtract Eq1 from Eq4:

(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7.

Simplify:

6A + 2B + 3C + 1 -6 -2B -3C -D = 6A -5 - D ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 6A - D -5 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is 6A - D ≡ 5 mod 7. Let's call this Eq5.

Similarly, subtract Eq2 from Eq4:

(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6A + 2 + 3C + D) = (6A -6A) + (2B - 2) + (3C -3C) + (1 - D) = 2B -2 + 1 - D = 2B -1 - D ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 2B - D -1 ≡ 0 mod 7. Let's call this Eq6.

Similarly, subtract Eq3 from Eq4:

(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6A + 2B + 3 + D) = (6A -6A) + (2B -2B) + (3C -3) + (1 - D) = 3C -3 +1 - D = 3C -2 - D ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 3C - D -2 ≡ 0 mod 7. Let's call this Eq7.

Now, Eq5: 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Eq6: 2B - D ≡1 mod7.

Eq7: 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So from Eq5, D ≡6A -5 mod7.

From Eq6, D ≡2B -1 mod7.

From Eq7, D ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, all three expressions for D must be congruent modulo7.

So, 6A -5 ≡ 2B -1 mod7.

And 6A -5 ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, let's write those.

First, 6A -5 ≡ 2B -1 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, allowed).

So 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, 6A -5 ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 coprime):

2A - C ≡1 mod7.

So now, we have:

From Eq5, D ≡6A -5 mod7.

From Eq6, D ≡2B -1 mod7.

From Eq7, D ≡3C -2 mod7.

And we have:

3A - B ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Eq8.

2A - C ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Eq9.

So, our goal is to find A, B, C, D digits, with A from 1-9, others 0-9, such that:

1. Eq8: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

2. Eq9: C ≡2A -1 mod7.

3. D ≡6A -5 mod7, D ≡2B -1 mod7, D ≡3C -2 mod7.

And also, the original number N = ABCD satisfies all four equations.

Additionally, since we want the largest N, which is 9999 or lower, but subject to these constraints.

So, to maximize N, we should maximize A first, then B, then C, then D.

So, let's start with A=9, the highest possible, and see if we can find B, C, D that satisfy the conditions.

If A=9, then let's compute B, C, D.

From Eq8: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

3*9=27, 27-2=25.

25 mod7: 7*3=21, 25-21=4.

So B ≡4 mod7.

Since B is a digit (0-9), possible values are 4 and 11, but 11 is invalid. So B=4.

But wait, 4 is the smallest possible value for B. But we want to maximize N, so perhaps we can have B=4 +7k, but since B is a digit, the maximum possible B is 4 +7*1=11, which is too big. So only possible B is 4.

Hmm, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, modulo 7, B can be 4, 11, 18, etc., but since B is a single digit, B must be 4.

Wait, that would mean if A=9, B has to be 4. But that would make N start with 9, then 4. But we might be able to get a higher N if A=8, but let's check.

Wait, maybe I should compute B as 3A -2 mod7, but B can be 4, 11, etc. Wait, no, mod7, it's 4. So B must be 4 or 11, but 11 is invalid, so B=4.

So for A=9, B=4.

Now, from Eq9: C ≡2A -1 mod7.

2*9=18, 18-1=17.

17 mod7: 7*2=14, 17-14=3.

So C ≡3 mod7.

C can be 3 or 10, but 10 is invalid, so C=3.

So for A=9, C=3.

Now, from Eq5: D ≡6A -5 mod7.

6*9=54, 54-5=49.

49 mod7 is 0. So D ≡0 mod7.

So D must be 0 or 7, since D is a digit.

But D is a digit, so D can be 0 or 7. Which one gives a higher N? 7 is higher, so we can set D=7.

So for A=9, B=4, C=3, D=7.

So N would be 9437. But let's check if this N satisfies all four original conditions.

Wait, let me verify each condition.

Compute each modified number and see if it's divisible by 7.

1. Changing A to 1: 1437.

Check 1437 ÷7. 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. So remainder 2. Not divisible by 7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, so N=9437 doesn't satisfy condition 1. So that can't be the case.

Hmm, so maybe my assumption that A=9 is invalid? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let's check the calculations again.

From Eq5: D ≡6A -5 mod7.

A=9: 6*9=54, 54-5=49. 49 mod7 is 0. So D must be 0 mod7. So D can be 0 or7.

So D=7 is the choice, which gives N=9437.

But when changing A to 1, the number is 1437, which according to our condition should be divisible by7, but 1437 ÷7 is 205.285..., which is not an integer. So that's a problem.

Which suggests that either my equations are wrong, or my approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in forming the equations. Let me double-check.

Wait, in Eq1, when changing A to 1, the number is 1BCD. So, in terms of N, that's 1000*1 + 100B +10C + D. So, the value is 1000 + 100B +10C + D.

Which modulo7 is 6 + 2B + 3C + D. So, that's correct.

Similarly, for other conditions, that seems correct.

So, perhaps N=9437 doesn't satisfy the conditions, which suggests that our approach is missing something. Maybe because when we set A=9, we get B=4, C=3, D=7, but N=9437 doesn't satisfy all four conditions.

Wait, but according to our equations, if A=9, B=4, C=3, D=7, then all four modified numbers should be divisible by 7.

But in reality, changing A to 1 gives 1437, which isn't divisible by 7. So, perhaps the mistake is in how we derived the equations.

Wait, let me think again. When we subtracted equations, perhaps we assumed that all four equations hold, but perhaps there's more to it.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about each modified number.

Each modified number must be congruent to 0 mod7.

Let me consider the four modified numbers:

1. 1BCD ≡0 mod7.

2. A1CD ≡0 mod7.

3. AB1D ≡0 mod7.

4. ABC1 ≡0 mod7.

So, these four numbers must all be divisible by7.

Let me write N as 1000A + 100B +10C + D.

So, for 1BCD: 1000 + 100B +10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

Which is (N - 1000A) +1000.

So, 1BCD = N -1000A +1000.

Similarly, A1CD = 1000A + 100 +10C + D = 1000A + (N - 1000A) +100.

Which is N -1000A +100.

Similarly, AB1D = 1000A +100B +10 + D = N -10C - D +10 + D = N -10C +10.

Wait, perhaps that's not the easiest way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write each condition as:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡0 mod7.

Which is (1000 mod7) + (100B mod7) + (10C mod7) + (D mod7) ≡0 mod7.

As I did before, 1000 mod7=6, 100 mod7=2, 10 mod7=3, 1 mod7=1.

So, 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. That's correct.

Similarly, A1CD: 1000A +100 +10C + D ≡0 mod7.

Which is (6A) + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, AB1D: 1000A + 100B +10 + D ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

And ABC1: 1000A +100B +10C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, the four conditions are correct.

So, why is N=9437 not satisfying the first condition?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting A=9, B=4, C=3, D=7.

Wait, let's compute whether 1BCD is 1437, which is 1000 + 400 +30 +7 =1437.

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. So, remainder 2. So, 1437 is not divisible by7. Which means that N=9437 doesn't satisfy condition1.

So, that can't be the case. Therefore, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should not set A=9, but try a lower A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe I should use the four equations to express B, C, D in terms of A, and then find A such that B, C, D are digits (0-9), and N is maximized.

So, from earlier:

From Eq8: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

From Eq9: C ≡2A -1 mod7.

From Eq5,6,7: D ≡6A -5 ≡2B -1 ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, let me express B, C, D in terms of A.

Let me write:

B = (3A -2) mod7.

But since B is a digit, it's equal to (3A -2) mod7, but if (3A -2) is negative, add 7 until it's positive.

Wait, but A is from1-9, so 3A ranges from3-27.

3A -2 ranges from1-25.

So, mod7, (3A -2) mod7 can be from0-6.

So, B = (3A -2) mod7.

But B is a digit, so it's in 0-9. So, possible values are (3A -2) mod7, or (3A -2) mod7 +7, if that's less than or equal to9.

Similarly for C: C = (2A -1) mod7.

And D is determined by D ≡6A -5 mod7, which is same as D ≡2B -1 mod7 and D≡3C -2 mod7.

So, perhaps for each A from9 down to1, compute B, C, D as per these equations, and check if all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

Because, even if the equations are satisfied, it's possible that the way D is set (mod7) might not satisfy all four conditions.

Wait, but if all four equations are satisfied, then all four modified numbers are divisible by7. So, perhaps the issue is that for A=9, the equations lead to a D which doesn't satisfy all conditions, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recast it.

Let me try A=9.

Compute B: (3*9 -2)=27-2=25. 25 mod7=4. So B=4.

C: (2*9 -1)=18-1=17. 17 mod7=3. So C=3.

D: from Eq5, D ≡6*9 -5=54-5=49≡0 mod7. So D=0 or7. Choose D=7 for maximum N.

So N=9437.

But as before, changing A to1 gives 1437, which is not divisible by7. So that suggests that even though the equations were satisfied, the condition isn't met.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, let me compute 1BCD=1437.

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435. 1435+2=1437. So 1437 is 7*205 +2. So, remainder2, not divisible.

So, the problem is that when A=9, B=4, C=3, D=7, the first condition isn't met.

So, perhaps the approach of setting A=9 is invalid.

So, let's try A=8.

Compute B: (3*8 -2)=24-2=22. 22 mod7=1 (since 7*3=21, 22-21=1). So B=1.

Wait, but 1 is a possible digit, but since we're trying to maximize N, having B=1 is worse than a higher B. But perhaps for A=8, B=1.

Wait, but wait, B can also be 1+7=8, since 22 mod7 is1, but 1+7=8 is a digit. So, perhaps B can be 8.

Wait, but let me think: the equation says B ≡3A -2 mod7. So, for A=8, 3*8=24-2=22, 22 mod7=1. So B can be 1 or 8 (since 1+7=8). So B can be 1 or8.

To maximize N, we'd choose B=8.

So, B=8.

Similarly, compute C: (2*8 -1)=16-1=15. 15 mod7=1 (since 7*2=14, 15-14=1). So C=1 or8 (1+7=8). So to maximize, C=8.

Then, D: from Eq5, D=6*8 -5=48-5=43. 43 mod7 is 43-7*6=43-42=1. So D≡1 mod7. So D can be 1 or8 (1+7=8). To maximize, D=8.

So, N=8888.

Now, let's check if this N=8888 satisfies all four conditions.

1. Changing A to1: 1888.

Check if 1888 is divisible by7.

7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. So remainder5, not divisible. So condition1 fails.

Hmm, so N=8888 doesn't satisfy condition1.

Hmm, this is confusing. Because according to the equations, it should satisfy. But in reality, it doesn't.

So, perhaps my approach is flawed, or perhaps there's a mistake in the equations.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Instead of trying A from9 down, maybe I should find N such that for each digit, changing it to1 makes the number divisible by7.

Wait, another approach: For each digit position, when we change it to1, the resulting number is divisible by7. So, for each position, the number with that digit set to1 is ≡0 mod7.

So, let's consider that.

Let me denote the four-digit number as N = wxyz, where w, x, y, z are digits (w≠0).

Then, when we change w to1: 1xyz ≡0 mod7.

When we change x to1: w1yz ≡0 mod7.

When we change y to1: wx1z ≡0 mod7.

When we change z to1: wxy1 ≡0 mod7.

So, four equations:

1. 1000 + 100x +10y + z ≡0 mod7.

2. 1000w + 100 +10y + z ≡0 mod7.

3. 1000w +100x +10 + z ≡0 mod7.

4. 1000w +100x +10y +1 ≡0 mod7.

As before.

We can compute each of these modulo7, as I did before, using 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1.

So, equations become:

1. 6 + 2x +3y + z ≡0 mod7.

2. 6w +2 +3y + z ≡0 mod7.

3. 6w +2x +3 + z ≡0 mod7.

4. 6w +2x +3y +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, these are the four equations.

Let me subtract equation1 from equation4:

(6w +2x +3y +1) - (6 +2x +3y + z) ≡0-0 mod7.

Simplify:

6w +2x +3y +1 -6 -2x -3y -z ≡ 6w -5 -z ≡0 mod7.

So, 6w -z ≡5 mod7. Let's call this equation5.

Similarly, subtract equation2 from equation4:

(6w +2x +3y +1) - (6w +2 +3y + z) = (0w) +2x -2 +0y +1 -z ≡2x -1 -z ≡0 mod7.

So, 2x -z ≡1 mod7. Equation6.

Subtract equation3 from equation4:

(6w +2x +3y +1) - (6w +2x +3 + z) = 0w +0x +3y -3 +1 - z ≡3y -2 -z ≡0 mod7.

So, 3y - z ≡2 mod7. Equation7.

So, equations5,6,7:

5. 6w - z ≡5 mod7.

6. 2x - z ≡1 mod7.

7. 3y - z ≡2 mod7.

So, from equation5: z ≡6w -5 mod7.

From equation6: z ≡2x -1 mod7.

From equation7: z ≡3y -2 mod7.

Thus, all three expressions for z must be congruent mod7.

So, 6w -5 ≡2x -1 mod7.

And 6w -5 ≡3y -2 mod7.

So, let's compute these congruences.

First, 6w -5 ≡2x -1 mod7.

Simplify: 6w -2x ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by2: 3w -x ≡2 mod7.

Second, 6w -5≡3y -2 mod7.

Simplify: 6w -3y ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by3: 2w -y ≡1 mod7.

So, now, we have:

Equation8: 3w -x ≡2 mod7.

Equation9: 2w -y ≡1 mod7.

So, to recap, given w, we can compute x and y as:

x ≡3w -2 mod7.

y ≡2w -1 mod7.

And z is computed from any of the expressions, like z=6w -5 mod7.

But since z is a digit, it must be between0 and9.

So, our plan is:

For w from9 down to1:

1. Compute x ≡3w -2 mod7. Since x is a digit, x can be (3w -2) mod7. If (3w -2) mod7 is negative, add7.

Similarly, y ≡2w -1 mod7.

Compute z ≡6w -5 mod7.

If z is a digit (0-9), then check if the computed x, y, z are digits, and compute N = 1000w +100x +10y + z.

Then, check if all four conditions are satisfied. If they are, then N is a candidate. Among all such candidates, pick the largest N.

But wait, perhaps the computed x, y, z from the mod equations might not satisfy all four conditions because when you set x, y, z as computed, the equations are satisfied, but the other conditions (like the original number N) might affect.

Wait, but in reality, the four conditions (equations1-4) are satisfied if the mod equations are satisfied, because we derived them from the conditions.

So, perhaps the problem arises when the computed x, y, z are digits, but when plugged into the equations, the four modified numbers are not necessarily all divisible by7.

Wait, but I thought that if equations1-4 are satisfied, then the four modified numbers are divisible by7. So, perhaps the approach is correct.

But in our earlier example, with w=9, x=4, y=3, z=7, the first condition wasn't met, which suggests that either the equations are not correctly derived or that perhaps the approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I subtracted equation1 from equation4, I got 6w -5 -z ≡0 mod7.

Wait, equation4 is 6w +2x +3y +1 ≡0 mod7.

Equation1 is 6 +2x +3y +z ≡0 mod7.

Subtracting equation1 from equation4:

(6w +2x +3y +1) - (6 +2x +3y +z) =6w -6 +1 -z=6(w-1) +1 -z.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, let me recompute.

Equation4: 6w +2x +3y +1 ≡0 mod7.

Equation1: 6 +2x +3y +z ≡0 mod7.

Subtract equation1 from equation4:

(6w +2x +3y +1) - (6 +2x +3y +z) =6w -6 + (2x -2x) + (3y -3y) + (1 -z) =6(w -1) +1 -z.

So, 6(w-1) +1 -z ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6(w-1) +1 ≡z mod7.

Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, equation5 should be:

z ≡6(w-1) +1 mod7.

Wait, so equation5 is z ≡6(w-1) +1 mod7.

Which is z ≡6w -6 +1 ≡6w -5 mod7.

Wait, that's what I had before. So, equation5 is correct.

Then, equation6 and equation7 are derived correctly.

So, perhaps my mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps in the example with w=9, the equations give x=4, y=3, z=7, but when I plug into equation1, does it hold?

Equation1:6 +2x +3y +z ≡0 mod7.

With x=4, y=3, z=7:

6 + 8 +9 +7 = 30.

30 mod7: 7*4=28, 30-28=2. So 30≡2 mod7≡ not 0. So equation1 is not satisfied.

Wait, but according to the equations, if equations8 and9 are satisfied, and z is set as per equation5, then equations1-4 should be satisfied.

So, perhaps the mistake is that when I computed x, y, z based on equations8 and9, I didn't check if they satisfy equation1.

Wait, because equation1 is 6 + 2x +3y +z ≡0 mod7.

Which, if x=3w-2 mod7, y=2w-1 mod7, and z=6w-5 mod7, then:

6 +2x +3y +z ≡6 + 2*(3w-2) +3*(2w-1) + (6w-5) mod7.

Compute this:

6 + (6w -4) + (6w -3) + (6w -5) =6 +6w -4 +6w -3 +6w -5.

Sum constants:6 -4 -3 -5= (6) - (4+3+5)=6-12= -6.

Sum terms with w:6w +6w +6w=18w.

So, total:18w -6.

18 mod7 is 4 (7*2=14, 18-14=4). So 18w mod7 is4w.

-6 mod7 is1 (since -6 +7=1).

So, 4w +1 mod7.

We need this ≡0 mod7.

So, 4w +1 ≡0 mod7.

Which implies 4w ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of4 mod7. The inverse of4 is 2 since 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, w ≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

So, w ≡5 mod7.

So, w can be5 or12, but since w is a digit from1-9, possible w=5.

Wait, but this contradicts our earlier approach where we tried w=9,8, etc.

So, this suggests that in order for equation1 to be satisfied, w must be ≡5 mod7.

Which would imply that w can be5 or12, but w is a digit, so w=5.

Wait, but then this contradicts the earlier approach where I thought to set w=9,8,... to maximize N.

So, perhaps the mistake is that I didn't consider that the equations are only satisfied when w≡5 mod7.

So, the only possible values of w are5 and12, but since w is a digit, only w=5 is valid.

Wait, but let's check:

If w=5, then:

From equation8: x ≡3*5 -2=15-2=13≡6 mod7. So x=6.

From equation9: y≡2*5 -1=10-1=9≡2 mod7. So y=2.

From equation5: z≡6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7. So z=4.

So, N=5 6 2 4=5624.

Let's check if all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

1. Change w to1:1624.

1624 ÷7: 7*232=1624. So yes, divisible.

2. Change x to1:5124.

5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124. So yes.

3. Change y to1:5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. So yes.

4. Change z to1:5621.

5621 ÷7: 7*803=5621. So yes.

So, N=5624 satisfies all four conditions.

But wait, is this the maximum N?

Wait, because according to the earlier deduction, w must be ≡5 mod7. So, possible w=5,12,19,... But since w is a digit, w=5 is the only possibility.

But that would make N=5624, which is a four-digit number, but perhaps not the maximum possible.

Wait, this can't be right because earlier when I tried A=9, B=4, C=3, D=7, I thought N=9437, which was larger than5624, but it didn't satisfy the first condition. So, perhaps w=5 is the only possible value for w, making N=5624 the only possible number.

But that seems contradictory because the problem states that N is the greatest four-digit number with this property.

So, perhaps the reasoning is that w must be ≡5 mod7. So, possible w=5,12,... But since w is a digit, only w=5 is possible.

Thus, N=5624 is the only number that satisfies the conditions, making it the greatest.

But that seems unlikely because the problem implies that such a number exists and is four-digit, but 5624 is less than9999.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step where I concluded that w must be ≡5 mod7.

Wait, let me go back.

We had equation1:6 +2x +3y +z ≡0 mod7.

We expressed x, y, z in terms of w.

Then, we substituted and found that equation1 reduces to4w +1≡0 mod7, which implies w≡5 mod7.

So, this suggests that w must be5 mod7.

So, possible w=5,12,19,... But since w is a digit, only w=5 is valid.

Thus, the only possible N is5624.

But wait, let's check another possibility. Suppose w=5+7=12, which is invalid as a digit. So, w=5 is the only option.

Wait, but that seems to contradict the idea that N is the greatest four-digit number. So, perhaps the only possible N is5624.

But then, why was N=9437 invalid? Because it didn't satisfy condition1.

So, perhaps the correct answer is5624, and thus Q=5, R=624. So, Q+R=5+624=629.

But I'm not sure because the problem says "greatest four-digit positive integer", so perhaps 5624 is the answer.

But wait, let me try another approach.

Perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that equation1 must be satisfied for w=9, but perhaps there is a higher N where w=5 and other digits are higher.

Wait, no, because if w=5, then the thousands digit is5, which is less than9. So, perhaps the maximum N is when w=5, and the other digits are as high as possible.

Wait, let me see.

Wait, when w=5, x=6, y=2, z=4. So, N=5624.

But perhaps if we can find a higher N with w=5, but with higher digits in x, y, z.

Wait, but according to the equations, x=6, y=2, z=4 are fixed when w=5. So, perhaps that's the only possible N when w=5.

Thus, N=5624 is the only four-digit number that satisfies the conditions, making it the greatest.

But that seems odd because the problem implies that such a number exists, but perhaps it's indeed 5624.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step where I derived that w must be5 mod7.

Wait, let me re-examine that step.

We had equation1:6 +2x +3y +z ≡0 mod7.

We expressed x=3w -2 mod7, y=2w -1 mod7, z=6w -5 mod7.

Substituting into equation1:

6 +2*(3w -2) +3*(2w -1) + (6w -5) ≡0 mod7.

Compute:

6 + (6w -4) + (6w -3) + (6w -5) =6 +6w -4 +6w -3 +6w -5.

Combine like terms:

6w +6w +6w =18w.

Constants:6 -4 -3 -5=6 -12= -6.

So, 18w -6 ≡0 mod7.

18 mod7=4, so 4w -6 ≡0 mod7.

Which is 4w ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of4 mod7, which is2, since4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, w≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

Thus, w must be5 mod7. So, w=5,12,... But as a digit, only w=5.

Thus, the only possible N is5624.

Therefore, the answer is Q=5, R=624, so Q+R=5+624=629.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident because earlier I thought N=9437 might be a candidate, but it didn't satisfy condition1. So, perhaps 5624 is indeed the only possible N.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, another way to approach this problem is to realize that when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7. So, the difference between N and the modified number must be such that N - modified number is a multiple of7.

For example, when we change the thousands digit from w to1, the modified number is1BCD, so N-1BCD= (1000w + 100B +10C + D) - (1000*1 +100B +10C + D) =1000(w-1).

So, 1000(w-1) must be divisible by7.

Similarly, when changing the hundreds digit from B to1, the modified number is w1CD. So, N -w1CD=100B -100*1=100(B-1). So, 100(B-1) must be divisible by7.

Same for the tens digit: N -wC1D=10C -10*1=10(C-1). So, 10(C-1) must be divisible by7.

And for the units digit: N -wCB1=1*D -1= D-1. So, D-1 must be divisible by7.

Wait, this is a different approach, but perhaps it can help.

So, each time we change a digit to1, the difference N - modified number must be divisible by7.

So:

1. Changing thousands digit:1000(w-1) ≡0 mod7.

2. Changing hundreds digit:100(B-1) ≡0 mod7.

3. Changing tens digit:10(C-1) ≡0 mod7.

4. Changing units digit: (D-1) ≡0 mod7.

So, these four differences must each be ≡0 mod7.

So, let's compute each condition:

1. 1000(w-1) ≡0 mod7.

Since1000≡6 mod7, 6(w-1) ≡0 mod7.

So, 6(w-1) ≡0 mod7.

Since6 and7 are coprime, this implies w-1 ≡0 mod7.

Thus, w-1≡0 mod7 → w≡1 mod7.

So, w must be1,8, or15, but since w is a digit, w=1 or8.

So, w can be1 or8.

Similarly, condition2:100(B-1)≡0 mod7.

100≡2 mod7, so 2(B-1)≡0 mod7.

Since2 and7 are coprime, B-1≡0 mod7.

Thus, B≡1 mod7.

So, B=1 or8.

Condition3:10(C-1)≡0 mod7.

10≡3 mod7, so3(C-1)≡0 mod7.

Thus, C-1≡0 mod7 since3 and7 are coprime.

So, C≡1 mod7.

Thus, C=1 or8.

Condition4:D-1≡0 mod7.

Thus, D≡1 mod7.

So, D=1 or8.

So, from these four conditions:

w must be1 or8.

B must be1 or8.

C must be1 or8.

D must be1 or8.

So, all digits w, B, C, D must be either1 or8.

But wait, this is a different result from earlier. Earlier, I thought that w had to be5 mod7, but now, according to this approach, w must be1 or8 mod7.

This suggests that my earlier approach was incorrect, and this new approach is the correct way to model the problem.

So, let's re-examine the problem with this new approach.

So, each digit can be either1 or8, because when you change a digit to1, the difference must be divisible by7.

So, w ∈{1,8}, B∈{1,8}, C∈{1,8}, D∈{1,8}.

Thus, N is a four-digit number where each digit is either1 or8.

And, N is the greatest such number. So, the maximum N would be8888.

But wait, let's check if8888 satisfies the original condition.

Changing any digit to1 gives:

1888, 8188, 8818, 8881.

Check if each is divisible by7.

1.1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Remainder5. Not divisible by7.

So, 8888 doesn't satisfy condition1.

Hmm, so this approach also gives a problem.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the reasoning. Because when we change a digit to1, the difference must be divisible by7, but perhaps the way we model it is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the difference N - modified number must be divisible by7.

Wait, for example, when we change w to1, the modified number is1BCD, so N -1BCD=1000(w-1).

Which must be divisible by7.

Similarly, when changing B to1, N -w1CD=100(B-1).

Which must be divisible by7.

Same for others.

So, in this case, for w=8, B=8, C=8, D=8, which gives N=8888.

Then, N -1BCD=8888 -1888=7000.

7000 ÷7=1000, which is divisible by7.

Similarly, N -w1CD=8888 -8188=700, which is divisible by7.

N -wC1D=8888 -8818=70, which is divisible by7.

N -wCB1=8888 -8881=7, which is divisible by7.

So, in this case, all four differences are divisible by7. So, all four modified numbers are congruent to N mod7.

But wait, N=8888.

If N is divisible by7, then all modified numbers would also be congruent to0 mod7, because N ≡0 mod7, and modified numbers = N - (difference), where difference ≡0 mod7.

Thus, if N is divisible by7, then all modified numbers would also be divisible by7.

But let's check if N=8888 is divisible by7.

Compute 8888 ÷7.

7*1269=8883, 8888-8883=5. So, 8888≡5 mod7.

Which is not 0, so N is not divisible by7.

So, the modified numbers would be N - difference, where difference is divisible by7, so modified numbers ≡N mod7 ≡5 mod7.

Thus, modified numbers are not divisible by7.

So, this suggests that our approach is incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps the mistake is that the modified numbers are N - difference, and since N is not divisible by7, the modified numbers won't be either.

So, perhaps the correct approach is that both N and the modified numbers must be congruent to0 mod7.

But how?

Wait, let me think.

If N - modified number is divisible by7, and modified number is ≡0 mod7, then N ≡ modified number mod7.

Which would imply N ≡0 mod7.

So, N must be divisible by7, and all modified numbers must also be ≡0 mod7.

Thus, N must be divisible by7, and when any digit is changed to1, the resulting number must also be ≡0 mod7.

But in that case, the difference between N and the modified number must be ≡0 mod7.

So, for example, when we change w to1:

N - modified number =1000(w -1) ≡0 mod7.

Similarly for other digits.

Thus, N must be ≡ modified number mod7.

But if modified number ≡0 mod7, then N≡0 mod7.

So, N must be divisible by7.

Thus, the initial approach is correct, but the condition is that N must be divisible by7, and when any digit is changed to1, the modified number is also divisible by7.

Thus, the difference between N and the modified number must be ≡0 mod7.

Which implies that for each digit, the difference caused by changing it to1 must be ≡0 mod7.

Which brings us back to the initial approach.

But in the earlier step, I found that w must be≡5 mod7, but when I tried w=5, it worked, but when I tried w=8, it didn't.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that w can be5 or12, but since w is a digit, only w=5 is valid.

Thus, N=5624 is the only possible number.

But that seems odd because the problem asks for the greatest four-digit number, which would be8888, but it doesn't satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is5624.

Thus, Q=5, R=624.

Q + R=5 + 624=629.

So, the final answer is629.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number \( ABCD \).
   - Changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.
   - We need to find the largest such \( N \) and compute \( Q + R \).

2. **Setting Up Equations**:
   - For each digit position, changing it to 1 must yield a number divisible by 7.
   - This leads to four congruences modulo 7:
     1. \( 6 + 2B + 3C + D \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     2. \( 6A + 2 + 3C + D \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     3. \( 6A + 2B + 3 + D \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     4. \( 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

3. **Deriving Relationships**:
   - Subtracting these equations leads to relationships between the digits:
     - \( 3A - B \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 2A - C \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 6A - D \equiv 5 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 2B - D \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 3C - D \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)

4. **Determining Possible Values**:
   - Solving these congruences shows that \( A \) must satisfy \( A \equiv 5 \mod 7 \). Since \( A \) is a digit, \( A = 5 \).
   - Substituting \( A = 5 \), we find \( B = 6 \), \( C = 2 \), and \( D = 4 \).

5. **Constructing \( N \)**:
   - Thus, \( N = 5624 \).

6. **Verifying \( N \)**:
   - Changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7:
     - Changing \( A \) to 1: \( 1624 \) is divisible by 7.
     - Changing \( B \) to 1: \( 5124 \) is divisible by 7.
     - Changing \( C \) to 1: \( 5614 \) is divisible by 7.
     - Changing \( D \) to 1: \( 5621 \) is divisible by 7.

7. **Calculating \( Q + R \)**:
   - \( Q = 5 \) (quotient when \( N \) is divided by 1000).
   - \( R = 624 \) (remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000).
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 624 = 629 \).

**Final Answer**:
\boxed{629}
