Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form. That might make it easier to handle the variables. Let me write down the equations again:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I'll take each equation one by one. Starting with the first one: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^n) = n*log_b(a), I can simplify this. So, applying that rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. 

Wait, that's correct. Because the exponent x is being moved in front as a multiplier. So now, the equation is x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, I also know that log_x(y) can be rewritten using the change of base formula. Specifically, log_x(y) is equal to (ln y) / (ln x). So, substituting that in, the equation becomes x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

Let me write that down: x * (ln y / ln x) = 10. Hmm, that's equation (1a). Maybe I can denote that as equation (1a) for reference later.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, applying the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Similarly, using the change of base formula, log_y(x) is (ln x)/(ln y). Substituting that in, the equation becomes 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10. Let me write that as equation (2a): 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10.

Now, looking at equations (1a) and (2a), they both have terms involving ln x and ln y. Maybe I can set some variables to simplify this. Let me let a = ln x and b = ln y. Then, equation (1a) becomes x * (b / a) = 10, and equation (2a) becomes 4y * (a / b) = 10.

Wait, but x and y are expressed in terms of a and b. Since a = ln x, that means x = e^a. Similarly, y = e^b. So, substituting x and y into these equations would give me:

Equation (1a): e^a * (b / a) = 10.

Equation (2a): 4 * e^b * (a / b) = 10.

Hmm, so now I have:

1. e^a * (b / a) = 10.

2. 4 e^b * (a / b) = 10.

Wait, so equation (1) is e^a * (b/a) = 10, equation (2) is 4 e^b * (a/b) = 10.

Hmm, maybe I can divide equation (2) by equation (1) to eliminate some variables. Let's see:

Equation (2) / Equation (1):

[4 e^b * (a/b)] / [e^a * (b/a)] = 10 / 10.

Simplify the left side:

4 e^b * (a/b) / (e^a * (b/a)) = 1.

Let me compute that step by step. The numerator in the fraction is 4 e
