Okay, so I have this problem where points A, B, C, D are on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that's less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, no—wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Actually, I think they are perpendicular. Let me confirm: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I consider points A, B, C, D, then the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. Therefore, the coordinates of the points must satisfy that if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), because the midpoint between A and C is the origin. Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). So, the points are arranged such that A and C are opposites, and B and D are opposites.

But wait, the problem says ABCD is a rhombus. So, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal. Since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal, but the angles can vary. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular, so AC ⊥ BD.

Given that, I can model the points as follows: Let’s denote points A, B, C, D as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (-x1, -y1), (-x2, -y2). So, the four points are such that A and C are symmetric about the origin, and B and D are symmetric as well.

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, substituting each point into the hyperbola equation gives:

For point A: (x1)²/20 - (y1)²/24 = 1

Similarly, for point B: (x2)²/20 - (y2)²/24 = 1

Same for points C and D, but since they are just negatives, plugging them in gives the same equation.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let me consider the vectors for the sides. The vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should all have the same magnitude.

Alternatively, since the sides are equal, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the properties of the rhombus and the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are perpendicular, we can model the diagonals as vectors along certain lines.

Let me think about the coordinates
