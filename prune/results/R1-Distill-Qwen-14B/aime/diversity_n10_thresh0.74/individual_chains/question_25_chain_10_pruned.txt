Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, it's about sets and maybe using some inclusion-exclusion principles. I remember that from my classes. Let me write down the information.

First, there are 900 residents total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's one thing everyone has. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. The numbers are:

- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spade owners: 562

And there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things (excluding the candy hearts, I think, because the problem says "each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts"). Also, 234 residents own exactly three of these things. The question is to find how many own all four: the ring, clubs, spade, and candy hearts.

Wait, but candy hearts are owned by everyone. So, maybe when it talks about exactly two or three things, it's referring to the other three items. Because candy hearts are a given. So, let me clarify:

Each resident has at least the candy hearts. So, when considering ownership of the other three items (diamond, golf, garden), the total number of people owning any combination of these would be less than or equal to 900. But since all own candy hearts, the total number of people owning any of the other three is still part of the 900.

So, the problem is about four categories: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond, golf, garden. But since candy hearts are everywhere, maybe it's easier to consider the other three as the variables.

Wait, but the residents can own just the candy hearts and nothing else, or they can own some combination including the other items. So, the problem is talking about how many own exactly two of the three items (diamond, golf, garden) plus the candy hearts, and exactly three of them plus the candy hearts.

But the problem states that 437 own exactly two of the things, and 234 own exactly three. Now, what's considered a "thing" here? The problem says "these things", which I think refers to the diamond, golf, garden, and candy hearts. Wait,
