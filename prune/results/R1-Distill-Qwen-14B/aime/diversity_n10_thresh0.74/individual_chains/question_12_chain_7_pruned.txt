Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Let me denote the cells as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
a & b & c \\ 
\hline 
d & e & f \\ 
\hline 
\end{array}
\]

So, the grid has digits a, b, c in the first row and d, e, f in the second row. Now, when we read left to right, we form two numbers. The first number is a two-digit number: ad and be, wait, no. Wait, reading left to right, each column forms a number. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999." Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted that.

Wait, perhaps it's that the first row forms a three-digit number, and the second row forms another three-digit number, and their sum is 999. Similarly, reading top to bottom, each column is a two-digit number, and their sum is 99. Oh, that makes more sense. So, let me rephrase:

- The top row (a, b, c) forms a three-digit number, which is 100a + 10b + c.
- The bottom row (d, e, f) forms another three-digit number, which is 100d + 10e + f.
- The sum of these two numbers is 999. So, (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Additionally, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, column 1 is ad, which is 10a + d; column 2 is be, which is 10b + e; column 3 is cf, which is 10c + f. The sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99. So, (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, to recap:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

And all variables a, b, c, d, e, f are digits, meaning they can be from 0 to 9. But wait, in the first row, since it's a three-digit number, a cannot be zero. Similarly, the second row, d cannot be zero. Because leading digits can't be zero for numbers. So, a and d are between 1 and 9, and b, c, e, f can be between 0 and 9.

Wait, but in the example given, the top row starts with 0. Wait, the example grid is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
0 & 0 & 8 \\ 
\hline 
9 & 9 & 1 \\ 
\hline 
\end{array}
\]

So, in the example, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom is 991. So, 8 + 991 = 999. So, actually, the top row is allowed to have leading zeros, so a can be zero. Wait, but in the grid, is the top row considered a three-digit number? Because 0 0 8 would be 008, which is just 8. Similarly, 9 9 1 is 991.

So, perhaps the two numbers being added are 008 and 991, which are three-digit numbers with possible leading zeros. So, a, b, c can be 0 to 9, same with d, e, f. So, a can be zero. So, that's important.

So, let's correct that. All digits a, b, c, d, e, f can be from 0 to 9, with the exception that when forming the numbers, leading zeros are allowed, so all digits are 0-9, no restrictions.

So, the equations are:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

We can rewrite the first equation as:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Which can be grouped as:
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Similarly, the second equation is:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Hmm, interesting. So, let me denote variables:

Let S1 = a + d
S2 = b + e
S3 = c + f

Then, equation 1 becomes:
100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999

Equation 2 is:
10 (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

But a + b + c = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) - (d + e + f)
Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, perhaps I can express equation 2 in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, a + b + c is not directly linked to S1, S2, S3. Let me think.

Wait, S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f.

So, a + b + c = (a + b + c)
Similarly, d + e + f = (d + e + f)

So, equation 2 is:
10 (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Hmm. So, if I let:
Let’s denote T = a + b + c
and U = d + e + f

Then equation 2 becomes:
10 T + U = 99

So, U = 99 - 10 T

But since U is the sum d + e + f, which is the sum of three digits, each between 0 and 9. So, the minimal value of U is 0 (if all d,e,f are 0) and maximum is 27 (if all are 9). Similarly, T is a + b + c, which is the sum of three digits, so T can be from 0 to 27.

But from equation 2: U = 99 - 10 T

But since U has to be between 0 and 27, let's see what possible T can be.

So, 99 - 10 T >= 0 → 10 T <= 99 → T <= 9.9. Since T is an integer (sum of digits), T <= 9.

Also, 99 - 10 T <= 27 → 99 - 27 <= 10 T → 72 <= 10 T → T >= 7.2. So, T >= 8.

So, T can be 8 or 9.

So, let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: T = 8 → U = 99 - 10*8 = 99 - 80 = 19

Case 2: T = 9 → U = 99 - 10*9 = 99 - 90 = 9

So, only two possibilities: T=8, U=19 or T=9, U=9.

Now, let's look back at equation 1:

100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999

Which is:

100 (a + d) + 10 (b + e) + (c + f) = 999

So, 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999

We can think of 999 as 1000 -1, so perhaps 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999, which can be written as 1000 -1.

But perhaps more straightforwardly, let's think about the possible values for S1, S2, S3.

Each of them is the sum of two digits (since S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f).

Each a and d are digits (0-9), so S1 can range from 0 to 18.

Similarly, S2 ranges 0-18, S3 ranges 0-18.

The equation 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

Let me write this as:

100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

Which suggests that 100 S1 must be less than or equal to 999, so S1 <= 9 because 100*10=1000 is more than 999. So S1 can be from 0 to 9.

Wait, but 100*9 = 900, which is less than 999.

So, S1 can be from 0 to 9.

Wait, but 100 S1 is part of 999, so:

If S1=9, then 100*9=900, so the remaining is 999-900=99, which has to be covered by 10 S2 + S3 = 99.

But 10 S2 + S3 =99. Since S2 and S3 are sums of two digits each, S2 can be from 0 to 18, S3 from 0 to 18.

But 10 S2 + S3 =99.

Let me see: 10 S2 can be up to 180, but in this case, we need 10 S2 + S3 =99.

So, S2 can be at most 9 because 10*10=100, which is already more than 99.

So, S2 ranges from 0 to 9.

Wait, but 10 S2 + S3 =99. S3 is at least 0, so 10 S2 <=99 → S2 <=9.

So, S2 can be from 0 to9, and for each S2, S3=99-10 S2.

But S3 must be the sum of two digits, so S3 must be between 0 and18.

So, 99-10 S2 must be between 0 and 18.

So, 99 -10 S2 >=0 → S2 <=9.9 → S2 <=9 (since it's integer).

And 99 -10 S2 <=18 → 99 -18 <=10 S2 → 81 <=10 S2 → S2 >=8.1 → S2 >=9.

So, S2 is 9.

So, when S1=9:

S2=9, then S3=99-10*9=9.

So, S3=9.

So, in case S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Alternatively, let's check if S1 can be less than 9.

Suppose S1=8.

Then 100*8=800. So, the remaining is 999-800=199.

So, 10 S2 + S3=199.

But 10 S2 + S3 can be at most 10*18 +18=198, which is less than 19
