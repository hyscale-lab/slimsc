Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on AB, not A or B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. We need to find OC², express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm, okay, so first, let me visualize this. O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis. The line AB connects these two points. The family F is all possible segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So each PQ is like a unit-length segment connecting the x and y axes.

I think each such segment PQ will form a right triangle with the axes, since P is on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So the coordinates of P would be (p, 0) and Q would be (0, q), with p and q positive. The length PQ is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1.

So each PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1. So the family F is all such segments.

The point C is on AB, distinct from A and B, such that it's only on AB and no other segment from F. So C is the only point on AB (other than A and B) that isn't intersected by any other PQ in F.

So, I need to find this point C on AB where, if I were to draw any other PQ from F, it wouldn't pass through C. So C is only on AB, not on any other segment in F.

I think the approach is to parametrize the line AB and then find the point C on AB which is not on any other PQ in F. To do that, perhaps I can find the equations of all possible PQs and then find the point C such that it's not on any of them except AB.

First, let's find the equation of line AB.

Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the slope of AB.

Slope m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). The equation of AB can be written using point-slope form.

Using point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, we can parametrize AB. Let me set x = t, then y = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2. So, point C can be represented as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t is between 0 and 1/2, since AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2).

So any point on AB is (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) with 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2.

Now, we need to find t such that the point (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, suppose there exists some PQ in F such that (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) lies on PQ. Since C is unique, there's only one such PQ which is AB itself.

Wait, but AB is a segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So AB is itself a member of F? Let me check.

Wait, AB is a segment from A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). What's the length of AB?

Compute AB's length: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is a segment in F. So AB is one of the PQs in F, and C is on AB, so it's on that particular PQ.

But the problem says that C is on AB and doesn't lie on any other PQ from F. So, we need to find C such that no other PQ in F passes through it.

So, for all other PQ in F, except AB, the point C is not on PQ.

So, to find C, we can think of it as the point on AB that isn't on any other PQ in F. So, perhaps we can find the envelope of all PQs in F, and C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Wait, that might be a good approach. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member
