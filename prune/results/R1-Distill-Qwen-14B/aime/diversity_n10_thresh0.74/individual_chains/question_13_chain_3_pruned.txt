Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to parse it out step by step. I'm going to take it slow because I don't want to get confused.

Alright, the problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they're asking me to find the number of minutes the walk takes her when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes again.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that when she changes her walking speed, the time taken for the walk itself changes, but the time spent in the coffee shop remains the same. So, the total time includes both walking and coffee shop time, but the coffee shop time is constant regardless of her walking speed.

Let me write down what I know.

First scenario:
- Speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours (which is 240 minutes)
- This includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

Second scenario:
- Speed: s + 2 km/h
- Total time: 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 144 minutes)
- Also includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

We need to find the total time when the speed is s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes.

So, the approach here is to figure out how much time Aya spends walking in each scenario and then set up equations to solve for 's' and 't'. Once we have 's', we can compute the walking time when the speed is s + 1/2 and then add 't' to get the total time.

Let's denote the walking time as T. Then, the total time is T + t.

In the first scenario:
Walking time, T1 = total time - t = 240 - t minutes. But walking time can also be calculated by distance divided by speed. Since the distance is 9 km, and speed is s km/h, the walking time in hours would be 9/s hours. But we have to convert this into minutes because the total time is given in minutes.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. Maybe it's better to work entirely in hours to avoid confusion with units.

So, the total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus coffee time. So, walking time is 4 - (t/60) hours.

Similarly, in the second scenario, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, total time is 2.4 hours. Therefore, walking time is 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

And we know that walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed. So, for the first scenario, walking time is 9 / s = 4 - (t/60).

For the second scenario, walking time is 9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60).

So, now we have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Our unknowns are 's' and 't'. So, we can set up these two equations and solve for them.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Now, since both equations have the same term (t/60), maybe I can subtract one equation from another to eliminate 't'. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can solve each equation for (t/60) and set them equal.

From Equation 1:
t/60 = 4 - (9/s)

From Equation 2:
t/60 = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

So, setting them equal:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

That's an equation with just 's' as the unknown. Let me simplify this.

Subtract 2.4 from both sides:

4 - 2.4 - (9/s) = - (9/(s + 2))

Which gives:

1.6 - (9/s) = - 9/(s + 2)

Let me rearrange this:

1.6 = (9/s) - (9/(s + 2))

Factor out 9:

1.6 = 9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)]

Compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)].

So now, we have:

1.6 = 9 * [ 2 / (s(s + 2)) ]

Simplify the right side:

1.6 = 18 / [s(s + 2)]

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

1.6 * s(s + 2) = 18

Divide both sides by 1.6:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Let me compute 18 divided by 1.6.

18 / 1.6 = (18 * 10) / (1.6 * 10) = 180 / 16 = 45/4 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Expand the left side:

s² + 2s = 11.25

Bring all terms to one side:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, we have a quadratic equation. Let's solve for 's' using the quadratic formula.

The quadratic is s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

Quadratic formula: s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So, sqrt(D) = 7

Thus, s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:

s = ( -2 + 7 ) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5

s = ( -2 - 7 ) / 2 = -9/2 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, so her original walking speed is 2.5 km/h. That seems a bit slow, but okay, maybe she walks slowly.

Now, let's find 't' using one of the earlier equations. Let's take Equation 1:

9/s = 4 - (t/60)

We know s = 2.5, so 9 / 2.5 = 3.6

So, 3.6 = 4 - (t/60)

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3.6 - 4 = - t/60

-0.4 = - t/60

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4 = t/60

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 24 minutes.

So, she spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop each time.

Now, the question is asking for the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her new speed is 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time, which includes walking time plus coffee time (t =24 minutes).

First, let's find the walking time when speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time = distance / speed = 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

So, walking time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.

Then, total time is walking time + coffee time = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure.
