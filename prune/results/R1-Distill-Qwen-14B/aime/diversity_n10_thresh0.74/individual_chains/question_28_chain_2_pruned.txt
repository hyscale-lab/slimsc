Okay, I'm trying to solve this tetrahedron problem. Let's see. We have a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find that distance, which will be in the form m√n/p, and then compute m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

But how do I find the inradius of a tetrahedron? I think it relates to the volume and the surface area. Specifically, for a tetrahedron, the formula is:

Inradius (r) = 3 * Volume (V) / Surface Area (A)

So, to find r, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and its total surface area.

First, let me see if I can find the volume. But I don't know the coordinates of the vertices, so maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant? Yeah, that's a formula that gives the volume based on the edge lengths. The formula is:

Volume = sqrt( CM / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix. Let me assign the given lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) → a² = 41
AC = sqrt(80) → b² = 80
AD = sqrt(89) → c² = 89
BC = sqrt(89) → d² = 89
BD = sqrt(80) → e² = 80
CD = sqrt(41) → f² = 41

So, plugging these into the determinant matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1,41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1,80,89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1,89,80,41, 0

I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. That seems a bit involved. Let's denote the determinant as CM.

But computing a 5x5 determinant by hand might be time-consuming. Maybe I can simplify it by row operations or look for patterns.

Alternatively, since the edge lengths have a certain symmetry, perhaps the tetrahedron is isosceles or something? Let me check.

Looking at the edges:
AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, the opposite edges are equal. That suggests that the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure.

But regardless, I need to compute the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this tetrahedron as two triangles in perpendicular planes? Hmm, maybe not sure.

Wait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the points. Let's say:

Let’s place point A at (x, y, z), B at some symmetric point, etc.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the properties of such a tetrahedron. Since AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, it's called a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, but in this case, the faces might not
