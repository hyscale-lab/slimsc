Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the least prime number p and then find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that p is the least prime for which there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². So, I need to find the smallest prime p such that p² divides some n⁴ + 1.

I remember that primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p might be relevant here. A quartic residue is a number that's a solution to x⁴ ≡ a mod p. So, if -1 is a quartic residue mod p, then there exists some x such that x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But here, we need more than that; we need that there's an n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². That implies n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, it's not just about residues mod p, but mod p².

I think primes p for which -1 is a quartic residue mod p also need to satisfy certain conditions for this to hold mod p². I remember something about Hensel's lemma, which is used for lifting solutions from mod p to mod higher powers. But I'm not entirely sure how it applies here.

Let me recall Hensel's lemma. It says that if f(x) ≡ 0 mod p has a simple root x ≡ a mod p (i.e., f(a) ≡ 0 mod p and f’(a) not ≡ 0 mod p), then there exists a unique lift of this root to mod p². So, perhaps I can use this to see if the solution x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p can be lifted to mod p².

Wait, but for Hensel's lemma, the derivative f’(x) = 4x³. If f’(x) ≡ 0 mod p, then Hensel's lemma doesn't apply, and the root might not lift uniquely or at all. So, to apply Hensel, we need that f’(x) ≡ 4x³ ≡ not 0 mod p. That is, x³ ≡ not 0 mod p. Which would mean that x is not 0 mod p, which it isn't because we're working mod p.

So, as long as 4x³ is not 0 mod p, Hensel applies. But since x is a solution mod p, x is not 0 mod p, so x³ is not 0 mod p. Therefore, as long as 4 is not 0 mod p, which it isn't since p is a prime greater than 2 (except for p=2, but 2 is a special case). Wait, but p=2 is a prime. Let me think about that.

Let me first check p=2. For p=2, let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's try n=1: 1 +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which is not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 82/4=20.5, not an integer. So, no n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. Let's see if there's an n with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8.

n=1: 1 mod9=1
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: 256 mod9=256-28*9=256-252=4
n=5: 625 mod9: 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4; so 4
Wait, 5⁴=625, 625 mod9: 6+2+5=13, 13 mod9=4, same as 625 mod9=4.

Wait, maybe I should compute it better. 4⁴ is 256. 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, so 256-252=4. So 4⁴ mod9=4.

Similarly, 5⁴: 5 mod9=5, 5²=25 mod9=7, 5⁴=(5²)²=7²=49 mod9=4.

So, 5⁴ mod9=4.

Similarly, 6⁴: 6²=36 mod9=0, so 6⁴=0 mod9.

7⁴: 7 mod9=7, 7²=49 mod9=4, 7⁴=(7²)²=4²=16 mod9=7.

8⁴: 8 mod9=8, 8²=64 mod9=1, so 8⁴=(8²)²=1²=1 mod9.

So, the possible n⁴ mod9 for n from 1 to 8 are: 1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1.

Looking for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9. Since -1 mod9 is 8. So, are any of these equal to 8? No. So, p=3 doesn't work.

Next prime is p=5. Let's see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25 has a solution.

First, see if -1 is a quartic residue mod5. Let me compute the quartic residues mod5.

Modulo 5, the possible residues are 0,1,2,3,4.

Compute x⁴ mod5:

x=1:1
x=2:16 mod5=1
x=3:81 mod5=1
x=4:256 mod5=1
x=0:0.

So, quartic residues mod5 are 0 and 1 only. So, -1 mod5 is 4. Is 4 a quartic residue mod5? From above, no. So, there's no x such that x⁴ ≡4 mod5. So, p=5 doesn't work.

Next prime, p=7.

Check if -1 is a quartic residue mod7. Compute quartic residues mod7.

Compute x⁴ mod7 for x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

x=1:1
x=2:16 mod7=2
x=3:81 mod7= 81-11*7=81-77=4
x=4:256 mod7: 256 /7=36*7=252, 256-252=4
x=5:625 mod7: 625-89*7=625-623=2
x=6:1296 mod7: 1296/7=185*7=1295, 1296-1295=1
x=0:0

So, quartic residues mod7: 0,1,2,4.

-1 mod7 is 6. Since 6 isn't among them, p=7 doesn't work.

Next prime, p=11.

Compute if -1 is a quartic residue mod11.

Compute quartic residues mod11. Let me compute x⁴ mod11 for x=0 to 10.

x=1:1
x=2:16 mod11=5
x=3:81 mod11=4
x=4:256 mod11: 256 -23*11=256-253=3
x=5:625 mod11=625-56*11=625-616=9
x=6:1296 mod11: 1296-117*11=1296-1287=9
x=7:2401 mod11: 2401-218*11=2401-2398=3
x=8:4096 mod11: 4096-372*11=4096-4092=4
x=9:6561 mod11: 6561-596*11=6561-6556=5
x=10:10000 mod11: 10000-909*11=10000-9999=1
x=0:0

So quartic residues mod11 are 0,1,3,4,5,9.

-1 mod11 is 10. 10 isn't in the quartic residues, so p=11 doesn't work.

Next prime, p=13.

Compute quartic residues mod13.

Compute x⁴ mod13 for x=0 to12.

x=1:1
x=2:16 mod13=3
x=3:81 mod13=81-6*13=81-78=3
x=4:256 mod13: 256/13=19*13=247, 256-247=9
x=5:625 mod13: 625-48*13=625-624=1
x=6:1296 mod13: 1296-99*13=1296-1287=9
x=7:2401 mod13: 2401-184*13=2401-2392=9
x=8:4096 mod13: 4096-315*13=4096-4095=1
x=9:6561 mod13: 6561-504*13=6561-6552=9
x=10:10000 mod13: 10000-769*13=10000-9997=3
x=11:14641 mod13: 14641-1126*13=14641-14638=3
x=12:20736 mod13: 20736-1595*13=20736-20735=1

So, quartic residues mod13 are 0,1,3,9.

-1 mod13 is 12. 12 isn't among the quartic residues, so p=13 doesn't work.

Next prime, p=17.

Compute quartic residues mod17.

x=1:1
x=2:16 mod17=16
x=3:81 mod17=81-4*17=81-68=13
x=4:256 mod17: 256-15*17=256-255=1
x=5:625 mod17: 625-36*17=625-612=13
x=6:1296 mod17: 1296-76*17=1296-1292=4
x=7:2401 mod17: 2401-141*17=2401-2397=4
x=8:4096 mod17: 4096-241*17=4096-4097= -1 mod17=16
x=9:6561 mod17: 6561-385*17=6561-6545=16
x=10:10000 mod17: 10000-588*17=10000-9996=4
x=11:14641 mod17: 14641-861*17=14641-14637=4
x=12:20736 mod17: 20736-1219*17=20736-20723=13
x=13:28561 mod17: 28561-1680*17=28561-28560=1
x=14:38416 mod17: Let's compute 14 mod17=14, 14²=196 mod17=196-11*17=196-187=9. So 14⁴=9²=81 mod17=13.
x=15:50625 mod17: 15²=225 mod17=225-13*17=225-221=4. 15⁴=4²=16 mod17.
x=16:16²=256 mod17=1, so 16⁴=1²=1 mod17.

So, quartic residues mod17 are 0,1,4,13,16.

-1 mod17 is 16. Oh, wait, 16 is a quartic residue. So, p=17 might be a candidate. Because x=8, 9, 15, 16 have x⁴ ≡16 mod17. So, -1 mod17 is 16, which is a quartic residue. So, p=17 is the first prime where -1 is a quartic residue. So, is p=17 the least prime where there exists an n with n⁴ +1 divisible by p²?

Wait, but p=17 is the least prime where -1 is a quartic residue mod p. But I need to confirm if there exists an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

So, to check if the solution x⁴ ≡ -1 mod17 can be lifted to a solution mod289.

I remember that when you have a solution mod p, you can sometimes lift it to mod p² using Hensel's lemma provided that the derivative at the root isn't zero mod p.

So, let's take one of the roots of x⁴ ≡ -1 mod17. Let's pick x=8. Because 8⁴=4096, which mod17 is 16≡-1.

Now, let's define f(x)=x⁴ +1. Then f(8) ≡0 mod17. We want to see if there's a solution mod17².

Compute f'(x)=4x³. At x=8, f'(8)=4*(8³)=4*512=2048.

Compute 2048 mod17. Let's compute 2048 /17: 17*120=2040, so 2048-2040=8. So, f'(8) ≡8 mod17.

Since 8 is not 0 mod17, Hensel's lemma applies, so there exists a unique solution mod17² (289) lifting x=8. Therefore, there exists some a ≡8 mod17 such that a⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Therefore, p=17 is the least prime for which there exists such an n. So, p=17.

Now, the next part is to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p²=289.

So, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Since we have the solution mod17, we can use Hensel's lemma to lift it.

We have x=8 mod17. Let's write x=8+17k, where k is an integer to be determined such that x⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Let me compute x⁴ where x=8+17k.

First, expand x⁴ using the binomial theorem:

x⁴ = (8 + 17k)^4 = 8^4 + 4*(8^3)*(17k) + 6*(8^2)*(17k)^2 + 4*(8)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But since we're working mod289=17², any term with (17k)^2 or higher will be 0 mod289. So, only the first two terms matter.

So, x⁴ ≡8^4 + 4*(8^3)*(17k) mod289.

Compute 8^4: 4096. Let's compute 4096 mod289.

Compute 289*14=4046. 4096-4046=50. So, 8^4 ≡50 mod289.

Now, compute 4*(8^3)*(17k) mod289.

8³=512. 4*512=2048.

So, 2048*(17k) mod289.

But 17k mod289 is 17k, so 2048*17k mod289.

Compute 2048 mod289: 289*7=2023. 2048-2023=25. So, 2048 ≡25 mod289.

Therefore, 25*17k mod289.

25*17=425. 425 mod289: 425-289=136. So, 425 ≡136 mod289.

So, the term 4*(8^3)*(17k) ≡136k mod289.

So, putting it all together, x⁴ ≡50 + 136k mod289.

We want x⁴ ≡-1 mod289, which is 289-1=288. So, 50 +136k ≡288 mod289.

Subtract 50: 136k ≡238 mod289.

So, 136k ≡238 mod289.

We need to solve for k: 136k ≡238 mod289.

First, let's compute the greatest common divisor of 136 and 289.

136 factors: 2³ *17.

289 is 17². So, gcd(136,289)=17.

Check if 17 divides 238: 238/17=14. So, yes, 17 divides 238.

Therefore, the equation has solutions. Let's divide the entire equation by17:

(136/17)k ≡238/17 mod289/17

Which simplifies to:

8k ≡14 mod17.

Now, solve for k: 8k ≡14 mod17.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 8 mod17.

What's the inverse of 8 mod17? We need a number m such that 8m≡1 mod17.

Let's compute:

8*2=16≡-1 mod17.

8*15=120≡120-7*17=120-119=1 mod17. So, inverse is 15.

So, multiplying both sides: k≡14*15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, 210-204=6. So, k≡6 mod17.

Therefore, k=6 +17t, where t is an integer.

But since we're working mod289, we can choose t=0 for the smallest positive k. So,
