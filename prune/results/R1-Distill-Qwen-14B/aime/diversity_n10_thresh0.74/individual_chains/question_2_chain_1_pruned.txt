Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out OC squared for a specific point C on segment AB. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, let me parse the given information.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis, a bit higher than A. I think it's forming a triangle OAB.

Then, there's this family of segments F. Each segment PQ is of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, with length 1. So all these segments are in the first quadrant, connecting (p,0) to (0,q) with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So p and q are positive numbers such that p² + q² =1.

The family F consists of all such segments PQ. So, for any point P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis such that PQ has length 1, PQ is in F.

Now, on the segment AB, there's a unique point C (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So, for all other segments in F, C isn't on them. So, AB is one of the segments in F, right? Because OA is (0,0) to (1/2, 0), but wait, OA is just a point on the x-axis, and OB is a point on the y-axis. Wait, AB is the segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check the length of AB.

The distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) =1. So AB is a segment of length 1, so AB is in F. So the family F includes AB and all other possible PQ segments of length 1.

So, the point C is on AB, and it's not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, it's the only such point on AB that's not on any other segment from F. Interesting.

I need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to this point C. Then, express OC² as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.

Okay, so how do I approach this?

I think this is a problem involving the envelope of lines or something like that. Because the family F is a set of lines (segments), and the point C is the point where all other lines in F (except AB) don't pass through. So perhaps C is the point where the envelope of F is tangent to AB or something.

Alternatively, maybe C is the point on AB that is the closest to the envelope of F, or perhaps the point where the envelope touches AB.

Wait, let me think. The family F consists of all segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, PQ=1. So for each t in (0,1), we can parametrize P as (t, 0) and Q as (0, sqrt(1 - t²)), right? Because t² + q² =1, so q = sqrt(1 - t²). So each PQ is the line segment connecting (t,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t²)).

So the equation of the line PQ can be written as x/t + y/(sqrt(1 - t²)) = 1. Because it's the intercept form of the line equation.

So, the family of lines is x/t + y/s = 1, where t² + s² =1. So s = sqrt(1 - t²).

But perhaps it's better to parametrize it differently. Let me use a parameter t where t goes from 0 to 1, representing the x-intercept, and s is determined as sqrt(1 - t²). So the line is x/t + y/s =1, with s = sqrt(1 - t²).

Now, the envelope of this family of lines is the curve that is tangent to each of these lines. So, the envelope is the set of points where each point is on exactly one line from the family, and the curve is tangent to that line at that point.

So, to find the envelope, we can use the standard method from calculus: for each t, find the point (x(t), y(t)) on the line x/t + y/s =1 where the derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, we can use the method where we solve for the envelope by eliminating t from the equations F(t, x, y) =0 and dF/dt =0.

Let me try that.

So, first, define F(t, x, y) = x/t + y/s -1 =0, where s = sqrt(1 - t²). So s is a function of t.

But perhaps it's better to write s as sqrt(1 - t²) without substituting it into F.

So, F(t, x, y) = x/t + y/s -1 =0.

Then, the derivative of F with respect to t is dF/dt = -x/t² - y/(
