Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

"Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A."

Hmm, okay. So Alice picks some set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob creates a list of all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024, and I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me try to break this down. So, set A is chosen by Alice, and Bob is going to list all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. So for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where the maximum is a, and the other elements of B are any positive integers less than a.

Wait, but the problem says that B is a set of positive integers, so the elements are distinct. So for a particular a in A, the number of possible sets B where the maximum is a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because each set B must include a and can include any combination of the numbers less than a.

But wait, since B is non-empty, and it must include a, so the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set. So for each a, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}.

Because the number of subsets of a set with (a-1) elements is 2^{a-1}. Each subset corresponds to a set B where the elements are the subset plus {a}.

So the total number of such sets B is the sum over a in A of 2^{a - 1}. And according to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So we have:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

We need to find the sum of elements in A, which is Sum_{a in A} a.

So the problem reduces to finding a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{a - 1} over all a in A is 2024, and then finding the sum of the a's.

Hmm. So the key is to find all possible sets A (though likely unique) such that the sum is 2024, and then compute their sum.

First, let me think about how 2024 can be expressed as a sum of terms of the form 2^{a - 1}, where a is a positive integer. Each term is a power of two, but the exponents are shifted by one.

Wait, 2^{a - 1} is equivalent to 2^{(a-1)}. So each term is a power of two, but the exponents correspond to a-1, so a = exponent + 1.

So the sum is over exponents where each exponent is at least 0 (since a is at least 1). So each term is 2^k where k is a non-negative integer
