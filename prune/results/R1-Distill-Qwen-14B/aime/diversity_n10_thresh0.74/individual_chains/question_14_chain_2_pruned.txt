Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. I need to find the largest such number, which probably means I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that changing any one digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for a four-digit number, say ABCD, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Hmm. That's a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this systematically.

First, let's represent N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, and A is not zero.

So, if I change each digit one by one to 1, I get four new numbers:

1. 1BCD
2. A1CD
3. AB1D
4. ABC1

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

I need to find the largest N (so A is as large as possible, then B, etc.) that satisfies this condition.

Since N is the largest possible, I should aim for N as close to 9999 as possible. So I'll start from 9999 and check downwards.

But checking each number one by one might be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the conditions each modified number must satisfy. Let's denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change A to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing B to 1 gives 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D, which must be divisible by 7.

Changing C to 1 gives 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D, which must be divisible by 7.

Changing D to 1 gives 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1, which must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

So, mathematically, we can write:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me compute each of these modulo 7. But before that, maybe I can find the modulo 7 of each of these numbers.

But let's compute the modulo 7 of each of these numbers:

First, 1000 mod 7: 1000 / 7 is 142 * 7 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 / 7 is 14*7=98, so 100-98=2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, since 10-7=3. So 10 ≡3 mod7.

1 mod7 is 1.

So let's rewrite the four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. A1CD ≡ (6A) + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. AB1D ≡6A + 2B + 1 + D ≡0 mod7
4. ABC1 ≡6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7

So, these are four congruence equations that must hold true.

So, let's denote:

Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7
Equation 2:6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7
Equation 3:6A + 2B + 1 + D ≡0 mod7
Equation 4:6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find some relationships between these equations.

Let me see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) = 6A + 2 -6 -2B =6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A - 2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

We can write this as:

6A - 2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:

(6A + 2B +1 + D) - (6A + 2 +3C + D) = 2B - 3C -1 ≡0 mod7.

So, 2B -3C ≡1 mod7.

Another subtraction: subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4:

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6A +2B +1 + D) =3C - D +0 ≡0 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡0 mod7.

And subtract Equation 1 from Equation 4:

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6 +2B +3C + D) =6A -6 +1 - D=6A -5 -D ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Wait, so let me list these derived equations:

From Equation 2 - Equation1: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7. (Equation A)
From Equation3 - Equation2: 2B -3C ≡1 mod7. (Equation B)
From Equation4 - Equation3: 3C - D ≡0 mod7. (Equation C)
From Equation4 - Equation1:6A - D ≡5 mod7. (Equation D)

Additionally, from Equation 4: 6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7. (Equation4)

So, perhaps I can express variables in terms of each other.

From Equation C: D ≡3C mod7.

From Equation D:6A - D ≡5 mod7.

But since D ≡3C, substitute into Equation D:

6A -3C ≡5 mod7.

From Equation A:6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

From Equation B:2B -3C ≡1 mod7.

So, let me write down the equations:

1. 6A -2B =4 +7k, for some integer k.
2. 2B -3C=1 +7m, for some integer m.
3. 6A -3C=5 +7n, for some integer n.
4. D=3C +7p, for some integer p.

Since A, B, C, D are digits (0-9), their values are limited, so perhaps k, m, n, p are small integers.

Let me see if I can express variables in terms.

From equation A: 6A -2B =4 +7k.

Let me denote equation A as: 6A = 2B +4 +7k.

Divide both sides by 2: 3A = B +2 + (7k)/2.

Hmm, but 7k must be even for B to be an integer. So, k must be even.

Let me set k=2t. So, 3A = B +2 +7t.

Similarly, from equation B: 2B -3C =1 +7m.

From equation C: D=3C +7p.

From equation D:6A -3C =5 +7n.

Wait, equation D is 6A -3C =5 +7n.

Let me try to express 6A from equation D: 6A =3C +5 +7n.

But from equation A, 6A =2B +4 +7k.

So:

2B +4 +7k =3C +5 +7n.

Simplify:

2B +4 -5 =3C +7n -7k.

So, 2B -1 =3C +7(n -k).

Let me rearrange:

2B =3C +1 +7(n -k).

But from equation B: 2B =3C +1 +7m.

Comparing the two:

3C +1 +7m =3C +1 +7(n -k)

Thus, 7m=7(n -k), which implies m =n -k.

So, m =n -k.

So, variables are connected.

Hmm, this is getting a bit involved. Maybe I can express all variables in terms of A and C, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express B and D in terms of A and C.

From equation A: 6A -2B =4 mod7.

So, 2B ≡6A -4 mod7.

Which is, B ≡3A -2 mod7/2.

Wait, 2 inverse mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So, multiplying both sides by 4:

B ≡ (6A -4)*4 mod7.

Wait, 6A -4 ≡ (6A mod7) - (4 mod7). 6 mod7 is 6, and 4 is 4. So, 6A -4 mod7.

Multiply by 4: B ≡ (6A -4)*4 mod7.

Compute 6*4=24≡3 mod7, and 4*4=16≡2 mod7.

So, B ≡3A -2 mod7.

So, B = (3A -2) mod7.

But since B is a digit (0-9), this gives B = (3A -2) +7s, where s is an integer such that B is between 0 and9.

Similarly, from equation B: 2B -3C ≡1 mod7.

From equation B: 2B ≡3C +1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by 4 (inverse of 2 mod7 is 4):

B ≡ (3C +1)*4 mod7.

Compute 3*4=12≡5, 1*4=4.

So, B ≡5C +4 mod7.

So, B =5C +4 +7t, where t is integer such that B is 0-9.

So, from equations A and B, we have two expressions for B:

B ≡3A -2 mod7.

B ≡5C +4 mod7.

Thus, 3A -2 ≡5C +4 mod7.

So, 3A -5C ≡6 mod7.

So, 3A -5C =6 +7u, for some integer u.

Let me note that.

So, 3A -5C =6 +7u.

I need to find A and C such that this holds, with A and C digits (A:1-9, C:0-9).

Additionally, from equation C: D=3C +7p.

Since D is a digit (0-9), 3C +7p must be between 0 and9.

So, 0 ≤3C +7p ≤9.

Since C is a digit (0-9), let's see possible p for each C.

For example:

If C=0: D=0 +7p. D must be 0,7.

C=1: D=3 +7p. So p=0→3, p=1→10 (invalid). So D=3.

C=2: D=6 +7p. p=0→6, p=1→13 invalid. So D=6.

C=3: D=9 +7p. p=0→9, p=1→16 invalid. So D=9.

C=4: D=12 +7p. 12 is already over 9, so no solution. Similarly for C≥4.

Wait, 3C must be ≤9-7p. Since p is an integer.

Wait, if C=4, 3C=12. 12 +7p ≤9→7p ≤-3. So p ≤-1.

p=-1: 12-7=5. So D=5.

p=-2:12-14= -2: invalid.

So C=4, p=-1: D=5.

Similarly for C=5: 3*5=15. 15 +7p ≤9 →7p ≤-6→p ≤-1.

p=-1:15-7=8. So D=8.

p=-2:15-14=1. So D=1.

Wait, but D must be a single digit, so 8 and 1 are valid.

Wait, but for C=5, 3C=15, so 15 +7p must be between 0 and9.

So p must satisfy 15+7p ≥0 →7p ≥-15 →p≥-2 (since p integer).

p=-2:15-14=1.

p=-1:15-7=8.

p=0:15 →invalid.

So D can be 1 or 8 for C=5.

Similarly, C=6: 3*6=18.

18 +7p ≤9 →7p ≤-9→p ≤-2.

p=-2:18-14=4.

p=-3:18-21=-3 invalid.

So D=4.

C=6: D=4.

C=7: 3*7=21.

21 +7p ≤9 →7p ≤-12 →p ≤-2.

p=-2:21-14=7.

p=-3:21-21=0.

So D=7 or 0.

C=7: D=7 or 0.

C=8: 3*8=24.

24 +7p ≤9 →7p ≤-15 →p ≤-3.

p=-3:24-21=3.

p=-4:24-28=-4 invalid.

So D=3.

C=9:3*9=27.

27 +7p ≤9 →7p ≤-18 →p ≤-3.

p=-3:27-21=6.

p=-4:27-28=-1 invalid.

So D=6.

So, for each C from 0 to9, D can be:

C | Possible D
0 | 0,7
1 |3
2 |6
3 |9
4 |5
5 |1,8
6 |4
7 |0,7
8 |3
9 |6

Now, let's return to the equation 3A -5C ≡6 mod7.

We
