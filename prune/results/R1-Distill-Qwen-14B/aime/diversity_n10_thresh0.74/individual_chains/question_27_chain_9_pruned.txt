Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So the distance from the center of the original circle to the axis is 6. That means the torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to find the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases.

Let me recall what the torus looks like. The major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. The sphere has radius 11.

First, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, their surfaces touch along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they touch along another circle.

I think I should model the torus mathematically. The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin, with the z-axis as the axis of rotation, is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

Where R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius.

In this case, R = 6 and r = 3. So the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

The sphere has radius 11, so its equation is:

x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the point of tangency is along a circle. Similarly for the external tangent.

To find the points of tangency, I think we can set up the equations of the torus and sphere and find where their surfaces touch. At the point of tangency, their normals are colinear, and the surfaces intersect only along a circle.

But solving this system might be tricky. Maybe there's a geometric approach instead.

Let me think about the centers. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis.

Wait, the sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center (which is on the axis) must be such that the torus just touches the sphere. Similarly, when it's outside.

Wait, maybe I can consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at the same center as the torus's axis. So the sphere is centered at the same point as the torus's center. So the torus is entirely inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus is externally tangent, so the sphere is outside the torus.

Wait, no. When the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, the sphere's center is outside the torus. Wait, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, perhaps the sphere is fixed, and the torus is placed either inside or outside of it, touching along a circle.

Wait, the problem says "when T rests on the inside of S", so the torus is placed inside the sphere, touching it. Similarly, when it's on the outside.

So the sphere is fixed, and the torus is placed inside or outside, touching the sphere.

So the sphere is centered at some point, and the torus is placed such that it's tangent to the sphere.

Wait, but the torus has its own center? Or is it centered at the same point as the sphere?

Hmm, maybe the torus is centered at the same point as the sphere. Because otherwise, the problem might not specify, but given the symmetry, probably yes.

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's generating circle's center is 6, the major radius. So the sphere has radius 11, and the torus's generating circle is 6 units from the center.

So when the torus is inside, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is inside, so the maximum distance from the center to any point on the torus is R + r = 6 +
