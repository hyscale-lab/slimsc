Okay, I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, so those four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, I should probably sketch a diagram to visualize the problem. Let me imagine rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is 107 units, which would make CD also 107. BC is 16, so AD is also 16. Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E must be somewhere along the line DC. Similarly, F is also on DC. Hmm, wait, but D and C are corners of ABCD, so DC is one of the sides.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the points are labeled A, B, C, D. So the order is such that AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, and so on. So ABCD is arranged in a rectangle, so AB and CD are opposite sides, each 107 units, and BC and AD are 16 units.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Points E, F, G, H are the corners. Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line DC has points D, E, C, F in that order? Or maybe E and F are somewhere else on the line DC. Wait, but D and C are two points, so the line DC is a straight line from D to C. So if E and F are on DC, they must lie between D and C or extended beyond them.

Wait, but rectangles EFGH and ABCD... Hmm. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's a cyclic quadrilateral. So quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Let me try to figure out the positions of E and F. Since E and F are on DC, and EFGH is a rectangle, then EF must be one of the sides of the rectangle. Given that EF is 184, which is quite long. FG is 17, so EF is a side of length 184, and FG is 17. So in rectangle EFGH, EF is one side, FG is another, so EF=184, FG=17. So the sides of EFGH are 184 and 17.

Wait, but EF is given as 184, which is the side from E to F on line DC. Since EF is 184, and FG is 17, so rectangle EFGH has sides 184 and 17. So, if E is to one side of DC, and F is on DC, then moving from E to F is along DC, which is 184 units, and then from F to G
