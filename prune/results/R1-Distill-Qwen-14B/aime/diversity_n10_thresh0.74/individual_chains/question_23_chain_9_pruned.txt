Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to visualize it first. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. 

The problem says that points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, so BD is one of the diagonals, and we're looking for the supremum of BD squared, I think.

First, let me recall some properties. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me check that. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So they intersect at right angles.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I denote the coordinates of the points, let's say point A is (x1, y1), then since the origin is the midpoint, the opposite point C would be (-x1, -y1). Similarly, point B would be (x2, y2), and point D would be (-x2, -y2). So, the four points are (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (-x1,-y1), (-x2,-y2).

Wait, but since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, which is equal to the distance between C and D, and equal to the distance between D and A.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the position vectors of A and C are negatives of each other, and similarly for B and D.

Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular. So, the vectors OA and OB should be perpendicular, right? Because the diagonals are perpendicular.

Wait, not necessarily. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Wait, but AC is from A to C, which is (-2x1, -2y1), and BD is from B to D, which is (-2x2, -2y2). So, for AC and BD to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.

So, (-2x1)(-2x2) + (-2y1)(-2y2) = 0. Which simplifies to 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x1x2 + y1y2 = 0. So, the condition is x1x2 + y1y2 = 0. That's important.

Also, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so they must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and their coordinates satisfy this equation. So, x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1, x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1.

Now, I need to find BD squared. Since BD is a diagonal from B to D, which is from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2). The length of BD is the distance between these two points.

Distance BD is sqrt[( -x2 - x2 )² + ( -y2 - y
