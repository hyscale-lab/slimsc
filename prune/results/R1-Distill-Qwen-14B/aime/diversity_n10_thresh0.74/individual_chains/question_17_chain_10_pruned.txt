Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box would have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. That makes sense because the sphere has to touch the farthest corners of the box, right? So, if I can find the space diagonal, which is the square root of (length^2 + width^2 + height^2), then that would be twice the radius. So the radius r would be half of that space diagonal. Therefore, r = sqrt(l² + w² + h²)/2, so r² would be (l² + w² + h²)/4. So, to minimize r, I need to minimize l² + w² + h², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Wait, but the problem states that the sphere must contain each of the boxes in set B, which has surface area 54 and volume 23. So, actually, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all such boxes, because the sphere has to contain all of them. So, the radius r must be at least as big as the space diagonal of the largest such box. Therefore, I need to find the maximum value of l² + w² + h² given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. Then, r² would be that maximum value divided by 4.

Okay, so let's denote the length, width, and height as x, y, z. So, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23.

So, our constraints are:
2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 => xy + yz + xz = 27
and
xyz = 23

We need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z².

Hmm, I remember that for three variables, there's a relationship between the sum of squares and the products. Let me think.

I know that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So, if I can find (x + y + z)², then I can express x² + y² + z² as (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + zx).

But wait, I don't know x + y + z. Maybe I can find it using some inequalities?

Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers because this is an optimization problem with constraints. That might be a more straightforward method.

Let me set up the problem. Let me define f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which we want to maximize. The constraints are:
g1(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0
g2(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

So, we can set up Lagrangian multipliers. The Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and setting them to zero.

Compute partial derivative with respect to x:

dL/dx = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly, for y:

dL/dy = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

And for z:

dL/dz = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

Also, the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27
xyz = 23

So, we have a system of five equations:

1) 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0
2) 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0
3) 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0
4) xy + yz + xz = 27
5) xyz = 23

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can assume some symmetry here. If x = y = z, we might get a potential solution, but let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area would be 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. So, volume would be 3³ = 27, which is more than 23. So, x = y = z is not feasible here because the volume is too big. Therefore, the boxes in set B can't be cubes, so the maximum must occur when the box is not a cube.

So, maybe we can assume two variables are equal. Let's say y = z.

Let me let y = z. Then, we can write the equations in terms of x and y.

So, with y = z, let's rewrite the constraints.

First, surface area:
xy + yz + xz = x y + y^2 + x y = 2xy + y² = 27

Volume:
x y² = 23

So, we have two equations:
2xy + y² = 27
x y² = 23

We can solve for x from the second equation: x = 23/(y²)

Substitute into the first equation:

2*(23/(y²))*y + y² = 27

Simplify:

46/(y) + y² = 27

Multiply both sides by y to eliminate the denominator:

46 + y³ = 27y

Bring all terms to one side:

y³ -27y +46 = 0

Hmm, let's try to factor this cubic equation. Let's look for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem.

Possible roots are factors of 46: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test y=1: 1 -27 +46= 20 ≠0

y=2: 8 -54 +46= 0 → 8-54= -46 +46=0. Oh, y=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (y - 2) out of y³ -27y +46.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide y³ -27y +46 by (y - 2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23  0

So, the cubic factors as (y - 2)(y² + 2y -23)=0

So, the other roots are y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

But since y is a length, it must be positive. So, y=2, or y=-1+2√6. Let's compute the numerical value of -1 + 2√6: √6 ≈2.449, so 2√6≈4.898. So, -1 +4.898≈3.898. So, positive, so y can be either 2 or approximately 3.898.

So, let's consider y=2 and y= -1 + 2√6.

Case 1: y=2. Then, from the volume equation, x=23/(y²)=23/(4)=5.75

So, x=5.75, y=2, z=2.

Compute x² + y² + z²: (5.75)^2 + 2² +2² = (33.0625) +4 +4= 41.0625. So, 41.0625 is 657/16.

Case 2: y= -1 + 2√6 ≈3.898. Let's compute x=23/(y²). First, compute y= -1 + 2√6, so y²= ( -1 +2√6 )²= 1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, x=23/(25 -4√6). Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

x=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 529: 529=23², so 23/529=1/23.

Thus, x= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, x≈(25 +4*2.449)/23≈(25 +9.796)/23≈34.796/23≈1.513.

So, x≈1.513, y≈3.898, z=y≈3.898.

Compute x² + y² + z²: (1.513)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2≈2.289 +15.193 +15.193≈32.675.

Hmm, 32.675 is less than 41.0625, so in this case, the sum of squares is smaller. But since we're looking for the maximum of x² + y² + z², the case when y=2 gives a larger sum, so that seems like the maximum.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm wrong in assuming y=z. Maybe the maximum occurs when all three variables are different. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different, but perhaps when y≠z, we can have a larger sum of squares.

But to check that, I might need to consider a more general approach without assuming y=z.

Alternatively, perhaps using inequalities to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints.

I know from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that (x² + y² + z²)(1 +1 +1) ≥ (x + y + z)^2. So, x² + y² + z² ≥ (x + y + z)^2 /3. But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming y=z.

Earlier, I set up the equations:

1) 2x - λ(y + z) - μ yz =0
2) 2y - λ(x + z) - μ xz =0
3) 2z - λ(x + y) - μ xy =0
4) xy + yz + xz =27
5) xyz=23

Hmm, this system looks symmetric in x, y, z. Perhaps if we let variables satisfy certain ratios.

Suppose that x, y, z are such that they are proportional to some constants. Let me think.

Alternatively, suppose that the ratios between x, y, z are such that x/y
