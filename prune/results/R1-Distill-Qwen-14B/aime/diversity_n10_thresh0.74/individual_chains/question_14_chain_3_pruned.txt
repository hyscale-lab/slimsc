Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the greatest four-digit number, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what the problem is asking. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 will make the number divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the condition. But that might take forever if I do it manually. There must be a smarter way.

Let me think about the implications of this condition. Suppose N is ABCD. Then each of the numbers formed by replacing one digit with 1 must be divisible by 7. So, each of these four numbers must satisfy the divisibility rule for 7.

Divisibility by 7 is a bit more complicated than some other rules. There's no straightforward digit-based rule like for 3 or 9, but I remember a trick: take the last digit, double it, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7. But applying that for each possible modified number might be time-consuming, especially since I don't know N yet.

Alternatively, I can represent N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, where A, B, C, D are its digits. Then, when I replace a digit with 1, the new number would be 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D (if replacing A), or 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D (if replacing B), and so on.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7, so the modified number mod 7 should be 0. Let's write equations for each case.

1. When A is replaced by 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. When B is replaced by 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. When C is replaced by 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. When D is replaced by 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, we can write these as:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me compute the coefficients of each term modulo 7 to simplify. Let's compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

- 1000 / 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7 (since 1000 - 994=6)
- 100 /7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7
- 10 mod7 is 3
- 1 mod7 is 1

So, substituting these into the equations:

1. (6) + (2)*B + (3)*C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. (6)*A + (2) + (3)*C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. (6)*A + (2)*B + (3) + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. (6)*A + (2)*B + (3)*C + (1) ≡ 0 mod7

So, simplifying:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7 --> 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod7 (since 6 ≡ -1 mod7, so 6 + ... ≡0 --> ... ≡1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 --> 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod7 (because 2 ≡ -5 mod7, so 6A + ... + (-5) ≡0 --> 6A + ... ≡5)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7 --> 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7 (since 3 ≡-4 mod7, so 6A + 2B + D -4 ≡0)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡0 mod7 --> 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7

So now, we have four congruences:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7

Hmm, that's a system of four equations with variables A, B, C, D, each being digits (0-9). But A can't be 0 because it's a four-digit number.

Wait, maybe I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables. Let's see.

Looking at equations 1 and 2:

Equation 1: 2B + 3C + D = 1 mod7
Equation 2: 6A + 3C + D =5 mod7

Subtract equation1 from equation2:

(6A + 3C + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡5 - 1 mod7
Simplify: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7
Which is 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

We can factor out 2: 2*(3A - B) ≡4 mod7 --> 3A - B ≡2 mod7 (since 2 has an inverse mod7: 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so multiply both sides by 4: (3A - B)*4 ≡4*4 mod7 --> 12A -4B ≡16 mod7 --> 5A -4B ≡2 mod7? Wait, maybe I should just divide both sides by 2, but since 2 and 7 are coprime, 2 has an inverse. Alternatively,
