Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I need to understand what's given. We have three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, which is a pretty large number. The other equation involves a combination of their squares multiplied by the other variables. Let me write that equation again to see if I can manipulate it:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me look for common factors in the terms. Each term has two variables, one squared and one to the first power. So, for example, a²b and a²c both have a². So perhaps I can factor out a² from those terms:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

That's a bit simpler. Now, since I know that a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute for (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b). Let's see:

We have (b + c) = 300 - a,
(a + c) = 300 - b,
(a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the equation, I get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That's a good step. Now, let's expand each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³,
b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³,
c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³.

Adding them up:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Combine like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm. So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if I can express this in terms of symmetric sums or find a way to relate it to the sum a + b + c. Let's see.

I know that (a + b + c) = 300, so maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums.

Recall that:

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Similarly, for the sum of cubes, I remember that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, substituting:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300^3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Let me compute 300^3: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Now, going back to the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expressions I found:

300[90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)] - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2(ab + bc + ca)) = -600(ab + bc + ca).

So, the first term is 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca).

Subtracting the second term:

[27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca)] - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let's distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Now, combine like terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0.

-600(ab + bc + ca) + 900(ab + bc + ca) = 300(ab + bc + ca).

-3abc remains.

So, the equation simplifies to:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

This seems a bit simpler. Let's write that as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange it as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this differently.

Let me factor out ab, bc, and ca:

ab(c - 100) + bc(c - 100) + ca(c - 100) = 2,000,000.

Wait, no, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can write:

100(ab + bc + ca) = abc + 2,000,000.

Divide both sides by abc (assuming abc ≠ 0, but I should check if abc can be zero):

100(ab + bc + ca) / abc = 1 + 2,000,000 / abc.

Wait, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can let x = ab + bc + ca, and y = abc, then the equation becomes:

100x - y = 2,000,000.

So, y = 100x - 2,000,000.

But I don't immediately see how that helps, unless I can relate x and y with the given sum a + b + c = 300.

Wait, I know that for three variables, we have the symmetric sums:

s1 = a + b + c = 300,

s2 = ab + bc + ca = x,

s3 = abc = y.

So, we have y = 100x - 2,000,000.

So, s3 = 100s2 - 2,000,000.

Hmm. But how can I relate s1, s2, and s3 for integers a, b, c?

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. The monic cubic with roots a, b, c is:

t^3 - s1 t^2 + s2 t - s3 = 0.

Substituting s1=300, s2=x, s3=y:

t^3 - 300t^2 + x t - y = 0.

But since y = 100x - 2,000,000, we can write this as:

t^3 - 300t^2 + x t - (100x - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify the equation:

t^3 - 300t^2 + x t - 100x + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this equation. Let's try to group terms:

t^3 - 300t^2 + x t - 100x + 2,000,000.

I can write this as:

t^3 - 300t^2 + x(t - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe if I factor (t - 100), but I don't see it immediately. Alternatively, perhaps I can set t = 100 and see if it's a root:

Plugging t=100:

100^3 - 300*(100)^2 + x*100 - 100x + 2,000,000.

Calculates as:

1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 100x - 100x + 2,000,000.

Which is:

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 0 + 2,000,000 = 0.

So, t=100 is a root. Therefore, (t - 100) is a factor of the cubic.

So, let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide the cubic by (t - 100). Let's use polynomial long division.

Divide t^3 - 300t^2 + x t - 100x + 2,000,000 by (t - 100).

First term: t^3 / t = t^2. Multiply (t - 100) by t^2: t^3 - 100t^2.

Subtract from the cubic:

(t^3 - 300t^2 + x t - 100x + 2,000,000) - (t^3 - 100t^2) = (-200t^2 + x t - 100x + 2,000,000).

Next term: -200t^2 / t = -200t. Multiply (t - 100) by -200t: -200t^2 + 20,000t.

Subtract:

(-200t^2 + x t - 100x + 2,000,000) - (-200t^2 +
