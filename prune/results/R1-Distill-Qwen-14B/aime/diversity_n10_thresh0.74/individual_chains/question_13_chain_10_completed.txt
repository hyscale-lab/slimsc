Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me read through it again carefully and try to break it down step by step.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. Hmm, so the total distance she walks is 9 km each day. 

The problem mentions two different scenarios regarding her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how much time her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Let me note down the given information:

1. When she walks at speed s km/h, the total time taken is 4 hours, which includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at speed s + 2 km/h, the total time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

Our goal is to find the total time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h, again including the coffee shop time.

First, I think I should figure out how long her walking time is in each scenario, excluding the coffee shop time. Because the coffee shop time is t minutes in both cases, and it's included in the total time, maybe I can subtract it to find the actual walking time.

Wait, but t is in minutes, and the walking time is in hours. I need to convert units so they are consistent. Let me think about that.

Let me denote:

- The time spent walking as T1 when speed is s km/h.
- The time spent walking as T2 when speed is s+2 km/h.

But the total time given includes t minutes of coffee shop. So:

Total time for first scenario: T1 + t = 4 hours.

Total time for second scenario: T2 + t = 2 hours and 24 minutes.

But t is in minutes, so I should convert the total times into minutes or the walking times into minutes? Maybe converting everything into hours or everything into minutes could help.

Let me try converting all times into minutes to make it easier.

First scenario:
Total time = 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
So, T1 (walking time) + t = 240 minutes.

Second scenario:
Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes.
So, T2 (walking time) + t = 144 minutes.

Now, I can set up equations based on the walking times.

We know that walking time is distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km in both cases.

So,
T1 = 9 / s hours. But T1 is in hours, and in the equation above, T1 is in minutes because t is in minutes. Wait, that's a unit inconsistency. I need to convert T1 into minutes.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to convert everything into hours. Let's see.

First scenario:
Total time = 4 hours, which includes walking time and coffee time t (in minutes). Let me convert t into hours. Since t is in minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, total time equation:
Walking time (hours) + coffee time (hours) = 4 hours.

Walking time is 9 / s hours, so:
9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, in the second scenario:
Walking time is 9 / (s + 2) hours, and total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

So, total time equation:
9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now, I have two equations:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t/60.

So:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Now, let's compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2):

Factor out 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

( (s + 2) - s ) / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, substituting back:

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Multiply 9 and 2:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Now, let's write the equation:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

We can write this as:

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Divide both sides by 1.6 to simplify:

18 / 1.6 = s(s + 2)

Calculate 18 / 1.6:

Well, 1.6 * 11 = 17.6, so 18 - 17.6 = 0.4, so 11 + 0.4/1.6 = 11.25

Wait, let me compute it properly:

18 ÷ 1.6: Let's convert 1.6 to a fraction. 1.6 = 8/5.

So, 18 ÷ (8/5) = 18 * (5/8) = (18*5)/8 = 90/8 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

So, we have the quadratic equation:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me write that down:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.

Quadratic formula: s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant, D = b² - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4*(1)*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So, sqrt(49) = 7

Thus,

s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

So, two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 =5/2=2.5

s = (-2 -7)/2 =-9/2=-4.5

But since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

So, Aya's walking speed is 2.5 km/h.

Now, we can find t from one of the earlier equations.

Let's use the first equation: 9/s + t/60 =4

We know s=2.5, so:

9 / 2.5 + t/60 =4

Calculate 9/2.5:

Well, 2.5 * 3 =7.5, so 9-7.5=1.5, so 3 + (1.5/2.5) = 3 + 0.6 =3.6 hours.

Wait, that's in hours. Since 9/2.5 is 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes. Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 9 divided by 2.5:

2.5 goes into 9 three times (2.5 *3=7.5). The remainder is 1.5. 1.5 divided by 2.5 is 0.6, so 3.6 hours.

But in terms of minutes, 0.6 hours is 0.6 *60=36 minutes. So, 3 hours 36 minutes.

So, 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes.

Wait, but in the equation, 9/s is in hours, so 3.6 hours.

So,

3.6 + t/60 =4

So, t/60=4 -3.6=0.4 hours.

Convert 0.4 hours to minutes: 0.4*60=24 minutes.

So, t=24 minutes.

Okay, so t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is: when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, find the total time including t minutes.

So, her new speed is s + 1/2 =2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, walking speed is 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time, including the coffee shop time t=24 minutes.

First, find the walking time: distance is 9 km, speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time=9/3=3 hours.

Now, add the coffee shop time: 3 hours +24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 180 minutes.

180 +24=204 minutes.

Alternatively, in hours, 3 hours and 24 minutes.

But the question asks for the number of minutes, so 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, s=2.5 km/h. At s+2=4.5 km/h, walking time is 9/4.5=2 hours, which plus t=24 minutes, gives 2 hours 24 minutes. That matches the second scenario given in the problem, so that's correct.

So, when walking at s +1/2=3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours. Adding t=24 minutes, total time is 3h24min, which is 204 minutes. So, 204 is the answer.

I think that's solid.


Aya walks 9 kilometers each morning. When walking at speed \( s \) km/h, the total time (walking + coffee shop) is 4 hours, and at \( s+2 \) km/h, it's 2 hours and 24 minutes. We aim to find the total time when she walks at \( s+\frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including coffee shop time.

First, convert the total times into hours:
- 4 hours remains 4 hours.
- 2 hours 24 minutes is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours.

Let \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) be the walking times at speeds \( s \) and \( s+2 \) km/h, respectively. The equations become:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Subtracting equation (2) from (1) to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
Simplify:
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
18 = 1.6s(s+2)
\]
\[
s(s+2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \):
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
The positive solution is \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) into equation (1):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

For speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]
Including coffee shop time:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
