Okay, so I have this problem here: there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make things clearer. 

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. I think the logarithm log_x(a) = b means that x^b = a. So in this case, x^10 = y^x. That seems manageable.

So, equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Now, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, this should mean that y^10 = x^{4y}. So equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Alright, so now I have two equations:

1) x^10 = y^x
2) y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find xy. Hmm, maybe I can express both x and y in terms of a common variable or find a relationship between them.

Let me take the first equation: x^10 = y^x. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to get a more workable equation. Taking ln on both sides: ln(x^10) = ln(y^x). Using the power rule, that becomes 10 ln x = x ln y. So equation 1a: 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}. Taking natural logs: ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y}), which becomes 10 ln y = 4y ln x. So equation 2a: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now I have:

1a) 10 ln x = x ln y
2a) 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let me try to express ln y from equation 1a and substitute into equation 2a.

From equation 1a: ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

Substituting into equation 2a: 10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

Simplify the left side: 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by ln x, assuming ln x â‰  0, which it isn't because x > 1. So we get 100 / x = 4y.

So, 100 / x = 4y. Let's solve for y: y = (100)/(4x) = 25/x.

Alright, so y is 25 divided by x. That's a useful relationship. Now, let's substitute this back into one of the earlier equations to find x.

Let me choose equation 1a: 10 ln x = x ln y.

But since y = 25/x, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x.

So substituting into equation 1a: 10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x).

Let me rewrite that: 10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x.

Hmm, let's collect like terms. Let's bring all terms involving ln x to one side.

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln25.

Factor out ln x: ln x (10 + x) = x ln25.

So, ln x = [x ln25] / (10 + x).

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can express x in terms of itself. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a better substitution.

Wait, since y = 25/x, and from equation 1: x^10 = y^x. Let's substitute y there.

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Simplify the right side: (25^x)/(x^x).

So, x^10 = 25^x / x^x.

Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Take both sides to the power of 1/x: x^{(10 + x)/x} = 25.

Simplify the exponent: (10 + x)/x = 10/x + 1.

So, x^{10/x + 1} = 25.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can write x as 5^k or something to make it easier.

Alternatively, let me take the natural logarithm of both sides.

ln(x^{10/x + 1}) = ln25.

Using the power rule: (10/x + 1) ln x = ln25.

Hmm, so ( (10 + x)/x ) ln x = ln25.

Wait, that's the same as we had earlier. So, I'm back to the same equation. Hmm.

Wait, but I can express ln x in terms from the earlier substitution.

Earlier, we had ln x = [x ln25]/(10 + x). Let me plug that into this equation.

So, ( (10 + x)/x ) * [x ln25 / (10 + x) ) ] = ln25

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

The left side is (10 + x)/x multiplied by ln x. But ln x is [x ln25]/(10 + x). So:

(10 + x)/x * [x ln25 / (10 + x)] = ln25.

Simplify: (10 +x) cancels, x cancels in the numerator and denominator. So, ln25 = ln25. Hmm, that's an identity. So, that doesn't help me find x. I need another approach.

Maybe I can use substitution with y =25/x into equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Wait, let me try that.

y =25/x, so y^10 = (25/x)^10.

And x^{4y} = x^{4*(25/x)} = x^{100/x}.

So, equation 2 becomes: (25
