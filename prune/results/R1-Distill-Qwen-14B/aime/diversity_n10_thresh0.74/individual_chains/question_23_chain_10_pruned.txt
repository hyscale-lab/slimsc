Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes math problems can get a bit tangled, but taking it one piece at a time helps.

Alright, the hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The general form is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, so here a² is 20 and b² is 24. That means a is sqrt(20) which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5), and b is sqrt(24) which is 2*sqrt(6).

Now, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, I know that all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, no, I think they do. Let me confirm: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So they intersect at 90 degrees, and each diagonal is cut into two equal parts by the other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the diagonals are straight lines passing through the origin, and their midpoints are at the origin.

So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, with its diagonals along some lines through the origin. Let me think about how the points lie on the hyperbola.

Since the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, points A, B, C, D must be positioned such that for every point (x, y), there's another point (-x, -y), but wait, no, in a rhombus, opposite vertices are symmetric. Let me think again.

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so each vertex is the midpoint of the opposite side. But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, this means that if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B would be somewhere else, and point D would be the opposite of B, (-x', -y').

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals aren't necessarily equal unless it's a square. So, in this case, the diagonals are not equal but they are perpendicular and bisect each other.

So, the diagonals of the rhombus are two lines passing through the origin, let's say one along a line with slope m and the other with slope -1/m, since they're perpendicular.

But maybe a better way to model this is to consider the points as lying on lines through the origin. Let's consider that points A and C lie on one line with slope m, and points B and D lie on another line with slope -1/m, since the diagonals are perpendicular.

So, points A and C can be represented as (t, m*t) for some parameter t, and points B and D as (s, (-1/m)*s) for some parameter s. Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, plugging these into the hyperbola equation should satisfy it.

So, for point A: (t)²/20 - (m*t)²/24 = 1
Similarly, for point B: (s)²/20 - ((-1/m)*s)²/24 = 1

Let me write these equations out.

For point A:
t² / 20 - (m² t²) / 24 = 1
Factor out t²:
t² (1/20 - m²/24) = 1
Similarly, for point B:
s²
