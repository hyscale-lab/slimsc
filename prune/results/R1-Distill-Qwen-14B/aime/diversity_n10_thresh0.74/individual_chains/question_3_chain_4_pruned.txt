Okay, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is about conditional probability. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me recall the formula for conditional probability. The probability of event A given event B is P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But since if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the conditional probability is P(A) / P(B), where A is winning the grand prize and B is winning a prize.

So, I need to calculate P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and P(B), the probability that she wins a prize. Then, divide them.

First, let's find P(A). The grand prize is when all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers.

The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is 1, because there's only one set of four numbers that matches her four.

So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Let me compute C(10,4). C(n,k) is n! / (k! (n - k)! )

So, 10! / (4! 6!) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) ) = 210.

So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Now, let's find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers match the four chosen. So, this includes cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the complement. The complement of winning a prize is when fewer than two numbers match, i.e., zero or one match.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(no matches) - P(exactly one match).

Let me compute P(no matches) and P(exactly one match).

First, the total number of possible 4-number combinations is C(10,4) = 210.

Number of ways to have no matches: Jen picks 4 numbers, and the lottery picks 4 numbers with none overlapping. So, the lottery's numbers are all from the remaining 6 numbers not picked by Jen.

So, the number of ways is C(6,4) = 15.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. If Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 6. The lottery could pick any 4 from the 10, but for no matches, it must pick all 4 from the 6 numbers Jen didn't pick.

So, the number of such combinations is C(6,4). Let me compute that: 6! / (4! 2!) = (6 × 5) / 2 = 15.

So, the number of ways with no matches is 15.

Similarly, the number of ways with exactly one match: Jen has 4 numbers, and the lottery picks 4 numbers with exactly one of them being one of Jen's numbers. So, the lottery picks 1 from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6.

So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3).
