Okay, so I have this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with a 50-50 chance. The question is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. They mention the probability is m/n with m and n coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. The vertices can be rotated by multiples of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45). So the possible rotations are 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, which correspond to 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps of 45 degrees each.

Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with probability 1/2. So the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256.

We need to find the number of colorings where there's some rotation that maps all blue vertices to red vertices. Alternatively, after some rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red.

Wait, but the problem is a bit tricky. Because when you rotate the octagon, the colors of the vertices move with the rotation. So for a coloring to satisfy the condition, there must exist a rotation such that every blue vertex is moved to a position where the original color was red.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you rotate, the blue set must align with the original red set.

Wait, but actually, in the problem statement, the octagon is rotated, so that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So if you color some vertices blue and others red, and then rotate the octagon, the blue ones should land on the red ones.

So another way to put it: the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So the coloring must be such that the blue and red sets are rotations of each other.

Therefore, the colorings we are interested in are those where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Since the octagon is regular, the red and blue sets must be in the same orbit under rotation.

But how do we count such colorings?

Alternatively, let me think in terms of group theory, perhaps
