Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, it's symmetric, which might help in counting the rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting non-adjacent vertices. The key here is that the sides of the rectangle lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle must be either a side of the dodecagon or a diagonal.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, there are diagonals of different lengths. For example, connecting two vertices with one vertex in between is a shorter diagonal, and connecting them with more vertices in between gives longer diagonals. So, perhaps the rectangles are formed by pairs of these diagonals or sides that are parallel.

I recall that in a regular polygon, the sides are all congruent, and the diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 10 other vertices (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices), so there are diagonals of different lengths. The number of different diagonal lengths in a regular n-gon is floor(n/2) - 1. For n=12, that gives 5 different diagonal lengths. So, in a dodecagon, we have sides and 5 types of diagonals.

Wait, no. Actually, the number of distinct diagonals in a regular n-gon is n(n-3)/2, but they can be categorized by their lengths. For n=12, each vertex connects to 9 others (excluding itself and two adjacent). But the number of distinct lengths is floor(n/2) -1, which for even n is (n/2 -1). So for n=12, that's 5 different diagonal lengths. So, including sides, we have 6 different types of line segments: the sides (which I can consider as a 0-step diagonal) and 5 different diagonals.

But rectangles require that opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, in the dodecagon, to form a rectangle, we need to select two pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that intersect each other, forming four right angles.

Alternatively, I think another approach is to consider the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational and reflectional symmetries. So, maybe the number of rectangles can be determined by how many distinct sets of four points form a rectangle.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a dodecagon, it's possible to inscribe a rectangle by selecting four vertices such that they form a rectangle. These would be axis-aligned with the polygon's center.

Wait, but the problem says the sides of the rectangle lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.
