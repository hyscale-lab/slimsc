Okay, so I've come across this math problem, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

We have a 5x5 grid, right? So that's 25 cells in total. We also have 25 white chips and 25 black chips. But we're not using all of them—we're placing *some* of these chips on the grid. The conditions are:

1. Each cell can hold at most one chip. So no cell is left with more than one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Hmm, that's interesting. So if I look at any row, every chip in that row is either all white or all black. Same thing for each column.
3. Any additional chip we try to place would violate the previous two conditions. So the placement is maximal—meaning we can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column color uniformity.

And the question is asking how many ways there are to place some chips under these conditions.

Let me break this down. First, each row must be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. But wait, the second condition says all chips in a row must be the same color, so if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color. The same applies to each column.

But also, the grid has to be such that no additional chip can be placed without violating the conditions. That means that if a cell is empty, adding a chip there would require that the entire row and column of that cell must be of the same color, but currently, they might not be.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If I try to place a chip in an empty cell, I have to make sure that the row and column would still satisfy the condition that all chips in that row and column are the same color. So if the row is currently not all one color, adding a chip would require that row to now be all that color, which might conflict with the column if the column already has chips of a different color.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid is in a state where every empty cell is such that either its row is not all the same color, or its column is not all the same color. Wait, no, because if I try to place
