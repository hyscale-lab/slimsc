Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \).

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know that \( z \) is a complex number with magnitude 4. That means \( |z| = 4 \), so \( z \overline{z} = |z|^2 = 16 \), where \( \overline{z} \) is the complex conjugate of \( z \).

The expression given is \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). I need to find the maximum real part of this expression.

Let me denote \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \) because \( |z|=4 \). That's a common way to represent complex numbers with a given magnitude. So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \).

Substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression:

First part: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \).

Second part: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression becomes:

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute each part separately.

First, compute \( (75 + 117i) \times 4 \):

75 * 4 = 300, 117 * 4 = 468. So this becomes \( 300 + 468i \).

So the first term is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

The second term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, let me express these exponentials in terms of cosine and sine. Remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, the first term becomes:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Similarly, the second term is:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

I need to multiply these out and then add them together.

Let me compute each multiplication.

First term:

Multiply \( (300 + 468i) \) with \( (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \):

Using distributive property:

300 * cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), that becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Now, group real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Similarly, compute the second term:

Multiply \( (24 + 36i) \) with \( (\cosθ - i sinθ) \):

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ.

Now, add the two results together. Let's add the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.

Real parts:

[300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]

= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

[300 sinθ + 468 cosθ] + [-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ]

= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ

= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So the entire expression is:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ).

But we only care about the real part, so that's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Wait, no! Wait a minute. Wait, no, actually, the expression is:

The first term's real part (300 cosθ -468 sinθ) plus the second term's real part (24 cosθ +36 sinθ) which sums to 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So the real part of the overall expression is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So, the real part is \( 324 \cosθ - 432 \sinθ \).

We need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies. So, the maximum of \( 324 \cosθ -432 \sinθ \).

I remember that an expression of the form \( A \cosθ + B \sinθ \) can be rewritten as \( R \cos(θ + φ) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \), and \( φ \) is some angle. The maximum value is then \( R \), since the cosine function has a maximum of 1.

Wait, but in our case, the expression is \( 324 \cosθ -432 \sinθ \). So that's like \( A \cosθ + B sinθ \), but with B negative. So, yes, the same approach applies.

So, let's compute \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Compute 324 squared:

324^2: Let's see, 300^2 is 90,000. 24^2 is 576. The cross term is 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2= 90000 +14400 +576= 105, 90000+14400=104400, +576=104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1024, cross term=2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2= 160000+25600+1024= 160000+25600=185,600 +1024= 186,624.

But since it's (-432)^2, it's same as 432^2, which is 186,624.

So R = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600).

What's sqrt(291600)? Let's see, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, 2*500*40=40,000. So (500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600.

So R = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, the expression is \( 324 \cosθ -432 \sinθ \), which is equal to \( R \cos(θ + φ) \), right? So the maximum value is R, which is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

First, I expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, correct.

Then, I expanded each term correctly, multiplied out, and found the real part correctly as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Then, I converted that into the amplitude form, computing R as sqrt(324^2 + 432^2), which is sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. So the maximum is 540.

Wait, but another thought: Could I have messed up the initial expansion? Let me see.

First term: (300 + 468i) times e^{iθ}.

Second term: (24 +36
