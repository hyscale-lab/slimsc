Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize, and B is the event of winning any prize.

So in this case, A is "winning the grand prize," which means all four numbers match. B is "winning a prize," which means at least two numbers match. So, since getting the grand prize automatically means you've won a prize, the intersection A ∩ B is just A. Therefore, P(A|B) is P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B).

Let me first figure out how many possible ways there are to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which is denoted as C(10,4). The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that can be chosen.

P(A) is the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. Since there's only one set that matches her numbers, the probability is 1 / 210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that Jen wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. To compute this, it's often easier to calculate the complement probability and subtract from 1.

The complement of winning a prize (B) is not winning a prize, which means fewer than two numbers match. So, that would be either 0 or 1 number matching.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

Let me calculate P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

First, P(0 matches): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that none of them are in Jen's chosen 4. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 that are not Jen's is C(6,4). 

C(6,4) is 15. So, the number of ways is 15. So, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210.

Next, P(1 match): the number of ways to choose exactly 1 number from Jen's 4 and the remaining 3 from the other 6 numbers.

The number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3). 

Calculating C(4,1) = 4, and C(6,3) = 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. So, P(1 match) = 80 / 210.

Adding these together: 15 + 80 = 95. So, the number of ways not to win a prize is 95, so P(not B) = 95 / 210.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - (95 / 210) = (210 - 95) / 210 = 115 / 210.

Simplify 115/210: both divisible by 5? 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, wait a second. Let me check that math again. 210 - 95 is 115, that's correct. 115 divided by 5 is 23, and 210 divided by 5 is 42, so yes, 23/42. So P(B) is 23/42.

But wait, let me cross-validate. Alternatively, P(B) is the probability of at least two matches, which can be calculated directly by summing the probabilities of exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches.

Calculating P(2 matches): C(4,2) * C(6,2) / C(10,4). C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15. So 6*15=90. 90/210.

P(3 matches): C(4,3)*C(6,1)/C(10,4). C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. 4*6=24. 24/210.

P(4 matches): 1/210.

So, adding these: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. 115/210, which is the same as before. So, P(B)=115/210=23/42. So, that's correct.

Now, P(A) is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that. Dividing (1/210) by (23/42) is the same as multiplying (1/210) by (42/23).

So, (1 * 42) / (210 * 23) = 42 / (210*23).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 42 and 210 share a factor of 42. 42 ÷42=1, 210 ÷42=5. So, 42/(210*23) =1/(5*23)=1/115.

Wait, let me do that again.

Wait, 42 / (210 *23) = (42 /210) * (1/23) = (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/115.

So, P(A|B) = 1/115.

Wait, but that seems a bit low. Let me think again.

Wait, P(A) is 1/210, P
