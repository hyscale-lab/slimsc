Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where I have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. I need to find the length of AP, given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me first try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, connecting AD, which intersects ω again at P. I need to find AP.

Let me recall some geometry concepts that might help here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-pole or something related to the polar line. Wait, but perhaps more straightforward: the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole, and it lies on the external angle bisector or something like that. Alternatively, maybe using power of a point.

Yes, power of a point could be useful here. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² = DC² because DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω. So, DB = DC. That's an important point.

Also, since AD meets ω again at P, AP is the segment from A to P, and we can perhaps use power of a point for point D with respect to ω. The power of D is DB² = DC² = DP * DA. So, DP * DA = DB².

Wait, that's right. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to the product of the lengths of DP and DA, which is equal to the square of the tangent from D to ω, which is DB² or DC².

So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, since DP = DB² / DA. Then, since AP = AD - DP, perhaps? Wait, no, because P is between A and D or D is outside the circle? Wait, AD is a secant from A passing through D, and intersecting ω again at P. Wait, no, AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects ω again at P? Or is D outside ω?

Wait, tangents at B and C meet at D. Since ABC is inscribed in ω, then D is outside ω because tangents from an external point. So, D is outside ω, and AD is a secant that passes through ω at A and P, with D outside.

So, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

So, if I can compute DB², and compute DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = AD - DP, I can find AP.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to find AP directly using other relations.

Wait, let's think
