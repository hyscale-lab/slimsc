Okay, so I have this logarithm problem to solve. Let me read it again:

There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10 and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help here. Let me write down what I know.

First, log_x(y^x) = 10. I know that log base a of b^c is equal to c times log base a of b. So maybe I can apply that here.

So, log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, that simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10.

But log_x(y) is the same as (ln y)/(ln x), right? So substituting that in, we get:

x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

Hmm, maybe I can denote ln x as A and ln y as B to make it simpler. Let's try that.

Let A = ln x and B = ln y.

Then, the equation becomes x * (B / A) = 10.

But x is e^A since A = ln x. So substituting that in:

e^A * (B / A) = 10.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about the second equation.

The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, that can be rewritten using the power rule as 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Again, log_y(x) is (ln x)/(ln y), which is A/B.

So substituting that in, the second equation becomes:

4y * (A / B) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1) x * (B / A) = 10

2) 4y * (A / B) = 10

Hmm, maybe I can solve these two equations together. Let me write them again:

Equation 1: x * (B / A) = 10.

Equation 2: 4y * (A / B) = 10.

If I multiply equation 1 and equation 2 together, what happens?

Equation 1 * Equation 2: [x * (B/A)] * [4y * (A/B)] = 10 * 10.

Let me compute the left side:

x * (B/A) * 4y * (A/B) = x * y * 4 * (B/A)*(A/B).

Wait, (B/A)*(A/B) is 1, so it's just 4xy.

So, 4xy = 100.

Therefore, xy = 100 / 4 = 25.

Wait, so xy is 25? That seems straightforward. But let me check if I did everything correctly.

Let me recap the steps:

1. Both equations given are logarithmic and equal to 10.

2. Applied the power rule of logarithms to both equations.

3. Expressed each equation in terms of natural logs, leading to expressions involving x, y, A, and B.

4. Noticing that the product of the two equations would eliminate A and B.

5. Multiplying the two equations gave me 4xy = 100, leading to xy =25.

That seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me try to find actual values for x and y and see if they satisfy both equations.

Let me suppose that xy = 25. So y = 25/x.

Let me substitute y into the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Which is log_x( (25/x)^x )= 10.

Let me compute that: log_x(25^x / x^x) = log_x(25^x) - log_x(x^x) = x * log_x(25) - x.

So that's equal to x*( log_x(25) - 1 ) = 10.

Hmm, log_x(25) is equal to ln(25)/ln(x), which is (2 ln5)/ln(x).

So, x*( (2 ln5)/ln(x) - 1 ) = 10.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can let u = ln(x), so that ln(25) = 2 ln5.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter substitution. Let me set t = ln(x). Then, ln(25) = 2 ln5, which is a constant.

So, x = e^t.

So the equation becomes e^t*( (2 ln5)/t - 1 ) = 10.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation in t, which might not have a closed-form solution, but perhaps I can find a value for t that satisfies this.

Wait, maybe instead of going this route, I can think of x and y in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, let me go back to the two equations:

Equation 1: x * (B/A) = 10.

Equation 2: 4y * (A/B) = 10.

Let me denote the ratio (B/A) as k. Then, equation 1 becomes x*k =10, so x = 10/(k).

Equation 2 becomes 4y*(1/k) =10. Multiplying both sides by k, 4y =10k, so y = (10k)/4 =
