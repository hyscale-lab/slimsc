Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable among their own colors. The task is to place some of these chips in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate the first two conditions.

So, I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. Each row must be all the same color, right? So, for each row, I can choose either white or black. Similarly, each column must also be all the same color. But wait, there's a catch here because the rows and columns have to align in some way.

Wait, if all the rows are the same color, and all the columns are the same color, but each cell can only have one chip, then the entire grid must be a single color? No, that can't be right because we have both white and black chips available. Wait, no, because each row and column can have their own color, but the constraints might make it so that the grid has a checkerboard pattern or some other configuration.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If each row is a single color, and each column is a single color, then the color of each cell is determined by both its row and column. So, for a cell in row i and column j, the color is both the color of row i and column j. Therefore, for the color of row i and column j to be compatible, they must be the same color. Otherwise, that cell would have a color conflict.

Wait, that's an important point. So, for each cell (i,j), the color is determined by both row i's color and column j's color. Since each cell can only have one color, the row color and column color must agree for all cells. So, that means that all rows must be the same color as all columns. Or wait, is that necessarily true?

Wait, no. Let's see. Suppose that each row is either white or black, and each column is either white or black. For the cell (i
