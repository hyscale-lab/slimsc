Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which has 12 sides. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I've heard of problems counting rectangles in grids or polygons before, but this seems a bit more specific. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides like a dodecagon, you can form rectangles by connecting non-adjacent vertices. But wait, the sides of the rectangle can be sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, maybe I need to find pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle.

Let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, it's symmetric, which should help in counting the rectangles.

In a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel sides. So, for a dodecagon, each side has several diagonals that are parallel to it. The number of such diagonals depends on the step between the vertices.

Wait, what do I mean by the step? Oh right, in a regular polygon with n sides, the distance between two vertices can be measured by the number of edges between them along the perimeter. So, for a dodecagon, steps can be 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 5, since beyond that, it's the
