Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's try to break it down.

First, I know that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and their products, sometimes factoring or symmetric expressions can help. Let me write down the two equations to get a clearer picture.

The first equation is straightforward:
a + b + c = 300.

The second equation is a bit more complex:
a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. If I factor this differently, maybe I can express it in terms of (a + b + c) or other symmetric sums.

Let me see. Each term is like a² multiplied by another variable. So, for example, a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, the other terms can be grouped:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

But since a + b + c = 300, then (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c. So substituting these into the equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a helpful substitution. Let me rewrite that:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

That's progress. Now, I need to relate this to the first equation, which is a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of that.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, from that, we can express a² + b² + c² as (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ac).

Let me compute that:

a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac).

So plugging that back into the equation:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute 300*90,000 first:

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

So,

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me subtract 6,000,000 from both sides:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0.

That simplifies to:

21,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0.

Rearranged:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, that's interesting. I wonder if there's a way to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums. I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

Let me write that down:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (300)³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

Calculating 300³:

300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

Now, substituting this into our earlier equation:

[27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc] + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000.

Simplify the terms:

27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000.

Combine like terms:

27,000,000 - 300(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc = 21,000,000.

Subtracting 21,000,000 from both sides:

6,000,000 - 300(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc = 0.

Let me rearrange this:

3abc - 300(ab + bc + ac) + 6,000,000 = 0.

Divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, so now we have:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) + 2,000,000 = 0.

This looks a bit more manageable. Let me factor this equation a bit more. Let's see if we can factor ab, bc, or ac.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor in terms of (ab)(c - 100) or something similar, but let's see.

Wait, let me write it as:

abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe grouping terms:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b) + 2,000,000 = 0.

But since a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting that in:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Let me compute each term.

First, ab(c - 100): Let's leave it as is for now.

Next, -100c(300 - c) = -30,000c + 100c².

So the equation becomes:

ab(c - 100) - 30,000c + 100c² + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, let's see. Maybe we can express ab in terms of (300 - c - b), but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for ab.

Looking back, the equation is:

ab(c - 100) + (-30,000c + 100c² + 2,000,000) = 0.

So,
