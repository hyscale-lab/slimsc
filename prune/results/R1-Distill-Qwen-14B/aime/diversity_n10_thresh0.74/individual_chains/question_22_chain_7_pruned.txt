Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. It says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, that seems important. Also, it mentions that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel—so AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Since it's equilateral, all sides are equal. Let's denote the side length as 's'.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Wait, so if I extend these three sides, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. I think this is called the outer triangle or something similar related to the hexagon.

I remember that in such hexagons, the triangle formed by the extensions of opposite sides is similar to the hexagon's sides in a specific ratio. But I'm not entirely sure, so I need to think more.

Let me recall that for a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's called a "parallelogon." But wait, in the plane, the only convex parallelogons are parallelograms. But a hexagon can have this property if each pair of opposite sides is both equal and parallel. So, it's a special kind of hexagon, sometimes referred to as a "zonogon."

In such a zonogon, the sides can be thought of as vectors that sum up to zero. Each pair of opposite sides is equal in length and opposite in direction. So, if I consider the hexagon as being built from three pairs of opposite vectors, the sum of all vectors equals zero.

Now, considering the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let me try to think about how these sides relate. Since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, and their extensions form a triangle, the lengths of these extensions must relate to the sides of the triangle given.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the triangle as a larger triangle that encompasses the hexagon. The hexagon is inside this triangle, and each side of the triangle is aligned with the extensions of the hexagon's sides.

Let me think in terms of similar triangles. If I can find the ratio between the sides of the outer triangle and the hexagon's sides, that would help.

But the triangle sides are 200, 240, and 300. These numbers look familiar. Let me check if they form a right triangle. 200² + 240² = 40,000 + 57,600 = 97,600. 300² is 90,000, which is less than 97,600, so not a right triangle. Alternatively, maybe it's a scaled version of a known triangle? Let's see, 200, 240, 300 have a common factor. Let's divide by 20: 10, 12, 15. Oh, that's a 10-12
