Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand all the given conditions and see how I can approach this.

First, the problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. The sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Then, I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let me break this down.

1. **Sum of the items is 30**: So, whatever numbers I have in the list, when added together, should total 30.

2. **Unique mode is 9**: Mode means the number that appears most frequently. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. Also, it's the unique mode, so no other number can have the same count as 9.

3. **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. And importantly, this median number isn't present in the list itself.

I need to find such a list and then compute the sum of the squares of its elements.

Let me start by recalling what a mode is. The mode is the number that appears most often. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Also, since it's the unique mode, no other number can appear as many times as 9.

Next, the median. The median depends on the number of elements in the list. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But wait, the median here is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting because if the number of elements is odd, the median is a specific element, but if even, the median could be a non-integer if the two middle numbers are different. Wait, no, the problem specifies the median is a positive integer. So, if the number of elements is even, the two middle numbers must average to an integer. That can happen in two cases: either both are the same integer (so the median is that integer, but that would mean it's present in the list, which is not allowed), or the two middle numbers are consecutive integers. For example, 4 and 5, which average to 4.5, which is not an integer. Wait, but the problem says the median is a positive integer. So the only way the median is an integer is if the two middle numbers are the same, but that would mean that number is in the list, which is not allowed. Therefore, the list must have an odd number of elements because then the median is just the middle element, which is an integer, and by the problem's statement, it's not present in the list. Wait, that can't be right because if it's the middle element, it's part of the list. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So, if the list has an odd number of
