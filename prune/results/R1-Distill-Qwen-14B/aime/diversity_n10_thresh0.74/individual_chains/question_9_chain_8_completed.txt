Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y to the power of x equals 10, and log base y of x to the power of 4y also equals 10. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it by using logarithm properties.

Alright, let me write down what I know. The problem says:

log_x(y^x) = 10
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be manipulated using certain properties. One key property is that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, maybe I can apply that here to simplify both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying the property, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Let me write that down:

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I wonder if I can express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other. I recall that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as some variable to make things easier. Let me say:

Let k = log_y(x).

Then, log_x(y) would be 1/k.

Substituting back into the equations, let's rewrite them.

First equation: x * (1/k) = 10 → x = 10k.

Second equation: 4y * k = 10 → 4y = 10/k → y = (10/k)/4 = (10)/(4k) = (5)/(2k).

So now I have expressions for both x and y in terms of k.

x = 10k
y = 5/(2k)

But I also know that k is log_y(x). Wait, since k = log_y(x), I can express that in exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, k = log_y(x) → y^k = x.

But from earlier, x = 10k and y = 5/(2k). So substituting these into y^k = x:

(5/(2k))^k = 10k.

Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify it. Let's try that.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln[(5/(2k))^k] = ln(10k).

Using the logarithm power rule, this becomes:

k * ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k).

Let me write that out:

k * [ln(5) - ln(2k)] = ln(10) + ln(k).

Expanding the left side:

k * ln(5) - k * ln(2k) = ln(10) + ln(k).

Wait, I can write k * ln(2k) as k*(ln2 + lnk). So:

k * ln5 - k*ln2 - k*lnk = ln10 + lnk.

Let me write that:

k ln5 - k ln2 - k lnk = ln10 + lnk.

Hmm, bringing all terms to one side:

k ln5 - k ln2 - k lnk - ln10 - lnk = 0.

Factor terms where possible. Let's see:

- k (lnk + ln2) + k ln5 - ln10 - lnk = 0.

Wait, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, let's group terms with lnk and others.

Looking at the equation:

k ln5 - k ln2 - k lnk - ln10 - lnk = 0.

Let me factor out the lnk terms:

(-k lnk - lnk) + (k ln5 - k ln2 - ln10) = 0.

Factor lnk from the first group:

lnk (-k - 1) + (k ln5 - k ln2 - ln10) = 0.

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should try a substitution. Let me let t = k, just to make it clear.

So, equation becomes:

t * ln(5/(2t)) = ln(10t).

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider substituting t = k, but I don't see an immediate simplification. Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of t = ln k.

Let me try that. Let me set t = ln k. Then, ln(1/(2k)) would be ln(1) - ln(2k) = 0 - (ln2 + lnk) = - (ln2 + t).

Wait, that might not help much. Alternatively, let's consider that equation:

k ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k).

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can write 5/(2k) as 5/(2k), and 10k as 10k. Maybe write both sides in terms of exponents? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can denote m = k, then the equation is:

m ln(5/(2m)) = ln(10m).

Let me expand the left side:

m [ln5 - ln(2m)] = ln10 + ln m.

Which is:

m ln5 - m ln2 - m ln m = ln10 + ln m.

Hmm, same as before. Maybe bring all terms to the left:

m ln5 - m ln2 - m ln m - ln10 - ln m = 0.

Let me factor where possible.

Looking at the terms:

ln5 is multiplied by m, ln2 by m, ln m by (-m -1), and ln10 is subtracted.

Hmm, perhaps this is leading me nowhere. Maybe I should consider taking both expressions for x and y and trying to find a relationship between them.

Wait, I have x = 10k and y = 5/(2k). So, the product xy would be x * y = (10k) * (5/(2k)) = (10k *5) / (2k) = (50k)/(2k) = 25. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me compute that again.

x = 10k, y = 5/(2k). So, x * y = (10k)*(5/(2k)) = (10 *5 *k) / (2k) = (50k)/(2k). The k cancels out, so it's 50/2 =25.

Wait, so xy = 25? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Did I make a mistake? Let me check.

x = 10k, y = 5/(2k). Multiplying them: (10k)(5/(2k)) = (10*5)/(2) * (k/k) = 50/2 *1 =25. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but the problem states that x and y are greater than 1. If xy=25, but I don't know the individual values. Maybe that is the answer? But wait, that seems too easy. Did I skip a step?

Wait, perhaps I need to verify if this is consistent with the original equations. Because I derived xy=25 without considering the equation that relates x and y through k.

Wait, so earlier I had the equation:

k ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k).

Which I can now plug in xy=25 and see if it holds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe my substitution is correct and the answer is 25.

Wait, but let me think again. I have x =10k, y=5/(2k). So, since k = log_y(x), which is log_{5/(2k)}(10k). Maybe I can solve for k.

Wait, let's try to solve for k. Let's go back to the equation:

k ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k).

Let me denote this as equation (A):

k [ln5 - ln(2k)] = ln(10) + ln(k).

Expanding:

k ln5 - k ln2 - k lnk = ln10 + lnk.

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms:

k ln5 - k ln2 = k lnk + lnk + ln10.

Factor the right side:

k ln5 - k ln2 = lnk (k +1) + ln10.

Hmm, perhaps this is a transcendental equation and can't be solved algebraically. Maybe I can find k numerically.

Wait, but the problem is asking for xy, which I found to be 25 regardless of k, as long as x and y satisfy those two initial logarithmic equations. So, perhaps 25 is the answer, regardless of the specific value of k.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that both logs equal 10. I used the logarithmic identities and expressed x and y in terms of k, which is log_y(x). Then, I found that xy is 25. Let me confirm if that's correct regardless of the value of k.

Wait, because x =10k and y=5/(2k), then x*y=10k*(5/(2k))=25 indeed. So, regardless of what k is, as long as x and y satisfy those two logarithmic equations, their product is 25. So, the answer is 25.

Wait, but maybe I should check if this holds with an example. Suppose I pick some k, compute x and y, then check if the original equations hold.

Let me pick a value for k and test. Let's say k=1.

If k=1, then x=10*1=10, y=5/(2*1)=2.5.

Now, check the first equation: log_x(y^x)=log_10(2.5^10). Let's compute 2.5^10.

2.5^10 is (5/2)^10 = 5^10 / 2^10 = 9765625 / 1024 ≈ 9536.7431640625.

log_10(9536.7431640625) ≈ log10(10^3.979) ≈ 3.979, which is not 10. So, that doesn't work. So, k=1 is not a solution.

Hmm, so maybe k isn't 1. Perhaps I need to find the correct k.

Wait, but the product is 25 regardless of k, so maybe I don't need to find k. The answer is 25. But wait, in that case, why did the problem give me two equations? Maybe because I need to ensure that such x and y exist.

Wait, perhaps I should try to find k such that the equation is satisfied.

Let me go back to equation (A):

k ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k).

Let me rewrite this as:

k [ln5 - ln(2k)] = ln(10k).

Which is:

k ln5 - k ln2 - k lnk = ln10 + lnk.

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange terms:

k ln5 - k ln2 - ln10 = k lnk + lnk.

Factor the right side:

k ln5 -k ln2 - ln10 = lnk (k +1).

Hmm, can I write lnk as m, so m = lnk. Then, k = e^m.

Substituting, we get:

e^m ln5 - e^m ln2 - ln10 = m (e^m +1).

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I can use numerical methods to approximate m.

Alternatively, maybe I can try to find m such that this holds.

Wait, let's make an initial guess. Let's try m=2, so k=e^2≈7.389.

Left side: e^2 ln5 - e^2 ln2 - ln10 ≈7.389*(1.6094 - 0.6931) - 2.3026 ≈7.389*(0.9163) -2.3026≈6.784 -2.3026≈4.481.

Right side: m(e^m +1)=2*(7.389 +1)=2*8.389≈16.778. Not equal.

So, left≈4.481, right≈16.778. Left < right.

Let me try m=1.5, so k=e^1.5≈4.4817.

Left side: e^1.5 ln5 - e^1.5 ln2 - ln10≈4.4817*(1.6094 -0.6931) -2.3026≈4.4817*(0.9163)≈4.108 -2.3026≈1.805.

Right side:1.5*(e^1.5 +1)≈1.5*(4.4817+1)=1.5*5.4817≈8.2226. Left < right.

Hmm, still left < right.

Let me try m=0.5, k=e^0.5≈1.6487.

Left side:1.6487*(1.6094 -0.6931) -2.3026≈1.6487*(0.9163)=1.512 -2.3026≈-0.7906.

Right side:0.5*(e^0.5 +1)=0.5*(1.6487 +1)=0.5*2.6487≈1.3243. Left < right.

Wait, but left is negative now, right is positive. So, perhaps the solution is between m=1.5 and m=2, but earlier at m=1.5, left was 1.805, right was 8.2226.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the left side for m=1.5.

Wait, let me recalculate for m=1.5.

m=1.5, so k=e^1.5≈4.4817.

Left side: k ln5 -k ln2 - ln10.

Compute each term:

k ln5 =4.4817 *1.6094≈4.4817*1.6 ≈7.1707.

k ln2=4.4817*0.6931≈3.104.

So, 7.1707 -3.104 =4.0667.

Then subtract ln10≈2.3026: 4.0667 -2.3026≈1.7641.

Right side: m(e^m +1)=1.5*(4.4817 +1)=1.5*5.4817≈8.2226.

So left≈1.7641, right≈8.2226. So, left < right.

Now, let's try m=3, k=e^3≈20.0855.

Left side:20.0855*(1.6094 -0.6931) -2.3026.

Compute inside the brackets:1.6094-0.6931=0.9163.

20.0855 *0.9163≈18.374.

18.374 -2.3026≈16.0714.

Right side:3*(20.0855 +1)=3*21.0855≈63.2565.

Left≈16.0714, right≈63.2565. Still left < right.

Wait, so as m increases, the left side increases but the right side increases much faster.

Wait, perhaps I need to try a smaller m.

Wait, earlier at m=0, left side: k=1.

Left side:1*(1.6094 -0.6931) -2.3026≈0.9163 -2.3026≈-1.3863.

Right side:0*(1+1)=0.

So, at m=0, left≈-1.3863, right=0. So, left < right.

Wait, but when m approaches negative infinity, what happens?

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I can try a different method.

Wait, perhaps I can let t = k, and write the equation as t ln(5/(2t)) = ln(10t).

Let me consider t=5/(2k) from y=5/(2k). Wait, no, that's y, not t.

Wait, perhaps I can let t = 2k, so that y=5/t.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can express the equation in terms of t= k*2.

Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution u = 2k, so that y=5/(2k) =5/u.

Then, equation (A) becomes:

k ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k).

Substituting u=2k → k=u/2.

Left side: (u/2) * ln(5/u) = (u/2)(ln5 - ln u).

Right side: ln(10*(u/2)) = ln(5u).

So equation becomes:

(u/2)(ln5 - ln u) = ln(5u).

Multiply both sides by 2:

u (ln5 - ln u) = 2 ln(5u).

Hmm, perhaps this is a better form. Let me expand the right side:

2 ln(5u) = 2 (ln5 + ln u) = 2 ln5 + 2 ln u.

So, equation is:

u ln5 - u ln u =2 ln5 +2 ln u.

Bring all terms to the left:

u ln5 -u ln u -2 ln5 -2 ln u =0.

Factor where possible:

ln5 (u -2) - ln u (u +2) =0.

Hmm, this equation is:

ln5 (u -2) = ln u (u +2).

Hmm, perhaps this is more manageable. Let me write it as:

[ln5 / ln u] = (u +2)/(u -2).

Wait, that's an interesting equation. Let me denote [ln5] = a constant, say, a ≈1.6094.

So, the equation becomes:

a (u -2) = ln u (u +2).

Let me rearrange:

a (u -2) - (u +2) ln u =0.

Hmm, perhaps I can solve this numerically. Let me try plugging in some values of u.

Let me try u=5.

Left side:1.6094*(5-2) - (5+2)*ln5≈1.6094*3 ≈4.8282 -7*1.6094≈4.8282 -11.2658≈-6.4376.

Not zero.

Try u=3:

1.6094*(3-2) - (3+2)*ln3≈1.6094*1≈1.6094 -5*1.0986≈1.6094-5.493≈-3.8836.

Still negative.

Try u=4:

1.6094*(4-2) -6*ln4≈1.6094*2≈3.2188 -6*1.3863≈3.2188 -8.3178≈-5.099.

Hmm, more negative.

Wait, maybe I should try a smaller u.

u=2:

But u=2 is not allowed because denominator in (u-2) would be zero. So, approaching u=2 from above.

u=2.5:

1.6094*(0.5) ≈0.8047

Minus (2.5+2)*ln(2.5)=4.5 *0.9163≈4.1234

So, 0.8047 -4.1234≈-3.3187.

Still negative.

Wait, maybe try u=1:

But u=1, y=5/u=5, which is acceptable. Let's compute:

1.6094*(1-2)=1.6094*(-1)= -1.6094

Minus (1+2)*ln1=3*0=0

So, -1.6094 -0= -1.6094.

Not zero.

Wait, perhaps try u=10:

1.6094*(10-2)=1.6094*8≈12.8752

Minus (10+2)*ln10=12*2.3026≈27.6312

So, 12.8752 -27.6312≈-14.756.

Still negative.

Wait, perhaps I need to try u <2. Let me try u=1.5:

1.6094*(1.5-2)=1.6094*(-0.5)= -0.8047

Minus (1.5+2)*ln1.5=3.5 *0.4055≈1.4192

So, -0.8047 -1.4192≈-2.2239.

Still negative.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me go back to the equation:

u ln5 - u ln u = 2 ln5 + 2 ln u.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write this as:

u ln5 - 2 ln5 = u ln u + 2 ln u.

Factor out ln5 on the left and ln u on the right:

ln5 (u -2) = ln u (u +2).

So, (u-2)/(u+2) = (ln u)/(ln5).

Hmm, perhaps I can try values where u is greater than 2.

Wait, earlier attempts with u=5, u=4, u=3, etc., all gave left side (u-2)/(u+2) as less than 1, while the right side (ln u)/(ln5) varies.

Wait, let me try u=5:

Left: (5-2)/(5+2)=3/7≈0.4286.

Right: ln5/ln5=1. So, 0.4286 <1.

u=4:

Left: (4-2)/(4+2)=2/6≈0.3333.

Right: ln4/ln5≈1.3863/1.6094≈0.861.

So, 0.3333 <0.861.

u=3:

Left:1/5=0.2. Right: ln3/ln5≈1.0986/1.6094≈0.681.

Still left < right.

u=2. Let me try u approaching 2 from above, say u=2.1.

Left: (2.1-2)/(2.1+2)=0.1/4.1≈0.0244.

Right: ln(2.1)/ln5≈0.7419/1.6094≈0.460.

Still left < right.

Hmm, perhaps I need to try u= something where left side equals right side.

Wait, what if u= something where (u-2)/(u+2)= (ln u)/(ln5). Maybe u=3. Let's see.

At u=3, left=1/5=0.2, right≈0.681. So, left < right.

At u=5, left≈0.4286, right=1.

Wait, perhaps the solution is at u= something like 2.5.

Wait, u=2.5:

Left:0.5/4.5≈0.1111.

Right: ln2.5/ln5≈0.9163/1.6094≈0.570.

Still left < right.

Wait, maybe the solution is when u is less than 2, but earlier attempts with u<2 gave negative values. Wait, let me check u=1.2.

u=1.2:

Left: (1.2-2)/(1.2+2)= (-0.8)/(3.2)= -0.25.

Right: ln1.2/ln5≈0.1823/1.6094≈0.1132.

So, left is negative, right is positive. So, no solution here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me retrace.

Wait, we started with k ln(5/(2k))=ln(10k).

I set u=2k, so that y=5/(2k)=5/u.

Then, the equation became:

(u/2) * ln(5/u) = ln(5u).

Which became:

u*(ln5 - lnu) = 2*(ln5 + lnu).

Then, u ln5 -u lnu = 2 ln5 +2 lnu.

Which rearranged to:

u ln5 -2 ln5 = u lnu +2 lnu.

Which factors to:

ln5 (u-2) = lnu (u+2).

So, (u-2)/(u+2)= (lnu)/(ln5).

Wait, perhaps I can let t = u, and try to find t such that (t-2)/(t+2)= (ln t)/ln5.

Let me try t=4:

Left: (4-2)/(4+2)=2/6≈0.3333.

Right: ln4/ln5≈1.3863/1.6094≈0.861. Not equal.

t=3:

Left:1/5=0.2; Right≈0.681.

t=2.5:

Left:0.5/4.5≈0.1111; Right≈0.570.

t=5:

Left:3/7≈0.4286; Right=1.

t=6:

Left:4/8=0.5; Right= ln6/ln5≈1.7918/1.6094≈1.113.

So, left=0.5 < right≈1.113.

t=7:

Left:5/9≈0.5556; Right≈ln7/ln5≈1.9459/1.6094≈1.209.

Hmm, perhaps the solution is when (t-2)/(t+2) = (ln t)/ln5.

Maybe I can try t=10:

Left:8/12≈0.6667; Right≈ln10/ln5≈2.3026/1.6094≈1.430.

Left < right.

t=15:

Left:13/17≈0.7647; Right≈ln15/ln5≈2.70805/1.6094≈1.682.

Still left < right.

t=20:

Left:18/22≈0.8182; Right≈ln20/ln5≈2.9957/1.6094≈1.862.

Hmm, left still < right.

Hmm, perhaps this equation doesn't have a solution for real u>0, which would imply that the original problem has no solution, but the problem states that such x and y exist. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to solve this equation numerically.

Let me define the function f(u) = (u-2)/(u+2) - (lnu)/ln5.

We need to find u where f(u)=0.

Let's evaluate f(u) at various points.

At u=2.5:

f(u)= (0.5)/(4.5) - (ln2.5)/ln5≈0.1111 -0.570≈-0.4589.

At u=3:

f(u)=1/5 - (ln3)/ln5≈0.2 -0.681≈-0.481.

At u=4:

f(u)=2/6 - (ln4)/ln5≈0.333 -0.861≈-0.528.

At u=5:

f(u)=3/7 -1≈0.4286 -1≈-0.5714.

At u=6:

f(u)=4/8 - (ln6)/ln5≈0.5 -1.113≈-0.613.

Wait, all these are negative. Let me try a smaller u.

At u=1.5:

f(u)= (-0.5)/(3.5) - (ln1.5)/ln5≈-0.1429 -0.1132≈-0.2561.

At u=1:

f(u)= (-1)/(3) -0≈-0.3333.

At u=0.5:

f(u)= (-1.5)/(2.5) - (ln0.5)/ln5≈-0.6 - (-0.6931/1.6094)≈-0.6 +0.4307≈-0.1693.

Hmm, seems like f(u) is always negative. That would suggest no solution, but the problem says such x and y exist. So, perhaps I made an error in substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should check my initial substitution steps again.

Wait, going back:

We had x = 10k and y =5/(2k).

From k = log_y(x) → y^k =x.

Substituting y=5/(2k), x=10k:

(5/(2k))^k =10k.

Taking natural log:

k * ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k).

Which is:

k ln5 -k ln(2k) = ln10 + lnk.

Which simplifies to:

k ln5 -k (ln2 + lnk) = ln10 + lnk.

Which is:

k ln5 -k ln2 -k lnk = ln10 + lnk.

Rearranged:

k ln5 -k ln2 = lnk (k +1) + ln10.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different substitution. Let me let m = lnk.

Then, k = e^m.

Substituting into equation:

e^m ln5 - e^m ln2 = e^m * m + m + ln10.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can write it as:

e^m (ln5 - ln2) = e^m m + m + ln10.

Hmm, or:

e^m (ln5 - ln2 - m) = m + ln10.

Hmm, perhaps this can be rearranged as:

e^m (ln(5/2) -m) -m -ln10=0.

Let me define this as f(m):

f(m) = e^m (ln(5/2) -m) -m -ln10.

I can try to find m where f(m)=0.

Compute f(m) for various m:

m=0:

f(0) =1*(ln2.5 -0) -0 -ln10≈0.9163 -2.3026≈-1.3863.

m=1:

f(1)=e*(ln2.5 -1) -1 -ln10≈2.718*(0.9163 -1)=2.718*(-0.0837)≈-0.2269 -1 -2.3026≈-3.5295.

m=2:

f(2)=e^2*(ln2.5 -2) -2 -ln10≈7.389*(0.9163 -2)=7.389*(-1.0837)≈-8.058 -2 -2.3026≈-12.3606.

m= -1:

f(-1)=e^{-1}*(ln2.5 - (-1)) - (-1) -ln10≈0.3679*(0.9163 +1)=0.3679*1.9163≈0.7045 +1 -2.3026≈0.7045+1=1.7045 -2.3026≈-0.5981.

m= -2:

f(-2)=e^{-2}*(ln2.5 - (-2)) - (-2) -ln10≈0.1353*(0.9163 +2)=0.1353*2.9163≈0.3944 +2 -2.3026≈0.3944+2=2.3944 -2.3026≈0.0918.

Ah, so at m=-2, f(m)=approx 0.0918, which is positive.

At m=-1, f(m)= -0.5981.

So, between m=-2 and m=-1, f(m) crosses zero from positive to negative. So, there's a root between m=-2 and m=-1.

Let me use the Intermediate Value Theorem to approximate it.

Compute f(-1.5):

m=-1.5.

f(-1.5)=e^{-1.5}*(ln2.5 - (-1.5)) - (-1.5) -ln10.

Compute each term:

e^{-1.5}≈0.2231.

ln2.5≈0.9163.

So, ln2.5 - (-1.5)=0.9163 +1.5=2.4163.

Multiply by e^{-1.5}: 0.2231 *2.4163≈0.540.

Then, subtract (-1.5): 0.540 +1.5=2.040.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026: 2.040 -2.3026≈-0.2626.

So, f(-1.5)≈-0.2626.

Wait, at m=-2, f≈0.0918; at m=-1.5, f≈-0.2626.

So, the root is between m=-2 and m=-1.5.

Let me try m=-1.75.

f(-1.75)=e^{-1.75}*(ln2.5 - (-1.75)) - (-1.75) -ln10.

Compute each part:

e^{-1.75}≈e^{-1.75}=1 / e^{1.75}≈1/5.7546≈0.1738.

ln2.5≈0.9163.

So, ln2.5 - (-1.75)=0.9163 +1.75=2.6663.

Multiply by e^{-1.75}:0.1738 *2.6663≈0.463.

Subtract (-1.75):0.463 +1.75=2.213.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.213 -2.3026≈-0.0896.

So, f(-1.75)≈-0.0896.

Hmm, so between m=-2 (f=0.0918) and m=-1.75 (f=-0.0896), the function crosses zero.

Let me try m=-1.85:

f(-1.85)=e^{-1.85}*(ln2.5 - (-1.85)) - (-1.85) -ln10.

Compute:

e^{-1.85}≈0.1577.

ln2.5≈0.9163.

So, ln2.5 +1.85=2.7663.

Multiply by e^{-1.85}:0.1577*2.7663≈0.435.

Add 1.85:0.435 +1.85=2.285.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.285 -2.3026≈-0.0176.

So, f(-1.85)=approx -0.0176.

Close to zero.

Let me try m=-1.8:

f(-1.8)=e^{-1.8}*(ln2.5 +1.8) - (-1.8) -ln10.

Compute:

e^{-1.8}≈0.1653.

ln2.5 +1.8≈0.9163 +1.8=2.7163.

Multiply:0.1653 *2.7163≈0.4487.

Add 1.8:0.4487 +1.8=2.2487.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.2487 -2.3026≈-0.0539.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, m=-1.85 gave f≈-0.0176.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate for m=-1.85.

Compute e^{-1.85} ≈ e^{-1} is 0.3679, e^{-0.85}=approx 0.4279. So, e^{-1.85}=e^{-1} * e^{-0.85}≈0.3679 *0.4279≈0.1577.

Then, ln2.5≈0.9163.

So, ln2.5 +1.85=0.9163 +1.85=2.7663.

Multiply by e^{-1.85}≈0.1577*2.7663≈0.435.

Then, -m=1.85, so subtract (-1.85)= add 1.85.

So, 0.435 +1.85=2.285.

Then, subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.285 -2.3026≈-0.0176.

So, f(-1.85)=approx -0.0176.

Now, let's try m=-1.83.

f(-1.83)=e^{-1.83}*(ln2.5 +1.83) - (-1.83) -ln10.

Compute:

e^{-1.83}≈approx?

Wait, perhaps I can use linear approximation between m=-1.8 and m=-1.9.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use m=-1.82.

Wait, let me try m=-1.82.

Compute e^{-1.82}≈?

e^{-1.8}=approx 0.1653.

e^{-0.02}=approx 0.9802.

So, e^{-1.82}=e^{-1.8} * e^{-0.02}≈0.1653 *0.9802≈0.1620.

Then, ln2.5 +1.82≈0.9163 +1.82=2.7363.

Multiply by e^{-1.82}≈0.1620 *2.7363≈0.4433.

Add 1.82:0.4433 +1.82≈2.2633.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.2633 -2.3026≈-0.0393.

Hmm, still negative.

Wait, perhaps m=-1.81.

e^{-1.81}≈e^{-1.8} * e^{-0.01}≈0.1653 *0.9900≈0.1638.

ln2.5 +1.81≈0.9163 +1.81≈2.7263.

Multiply by e^{-1.81}≈0.1638 *2.7263≈0.4472.

Add 1.81:0.4472 +1.81≈2.2572.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.2572 -2.3026≈-0.0454.

Hmm, getting more negative.

Wait, perhaps I should go to m=-1.84.

Wait, at m=-1.85, f≈-0.0176.

m=-1.84:

Compute e^{-1.84}=e^{-1.8} * e^{-0.04}=0.1653 *0.9608≈0.1587.

ln2.5 +1.84≈0.9163 +1.84=2.7563.

Multiply by e^{-1.84}≈0.1587 *2.7563≈0.4366.

Add 1.84:0.4366 +1.84≈2.2766.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.2766 -2.3026≈-0.026.

Hmm, still negative.

Wait, perhaps m=-1.86.

e^{-1.86}=e^{-1.8} *e^{-0.06}=0.1653 *0.9418≈0.1555.

ln2.5 +1.86≈0.9163 +1.86=2.7763.

Multiply by e^{-1.86}≈0.1555 *2.7763≈0.4312.

Add 1.86:0.4312 +1.86=2.2912.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.2912 -2.3026≈-0.0114.

Hmm, getting closer.

m=-1.87:

e^{-1.87}=e^{-1.8} *e^{-0.07}=0.1653 *0.9324≈0.1541.

ln2.5 +1.87≈0.9163 +1.87=2.7863.

Multiply by e^{-1.87}≈0.1541 *2.7863≈0.429.

Add 1.87:0.429 +1.87=2.299.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.299 -2.3026≈-0.0036.

Almost zero.

m=-1.88:

e^{-1.88}=e^{-1.8} *e^{-0.08}=0.1653 *0.9231≈0.1527.

ln2.5 +1.88≈0.9163 +1.88=2.7963.

Multiply by e^{-1.88}≈0.1527 *2.7963≈0.4275.

Add 1.88:0.4275 +1.88=2.3075.

Subtract ln10≈2.3026:2.3075 -2.3026≈0.0049.

So, f(-1.88)=approx 0.0049.

So, the root is between m=-1.87 and m=-1.88.

Using linear approximation.

At m=-1.87, f≈-0.0036.

At m=-1.88, f≈0.0049.

The change in m is 0.01, and the change in f is 0.0049 - (-0.0036)=0.0085.

We need to find dm such that f=0.

The fraction needed is 0.0036/0.0085≈0.4235.

So, dm≈0.01 *0.4235≈0.004235.

So, m≈-1.87 +0.004235≈-1.8658.

So, m≈-1.8658.

Thus, k = e^{m}=e^{-1.8658}≈approx?

Compute e^{-1.8658}=1/e^{1.8658}.

Compute e^1.8658:

We know that e^1.8≈6.05, e^1.86≈6.43, e^1.8658≈approx 6.46.

So, e^{-1.8658}≈1/6.46≈0.1547.

So, k≈0.1547.

Then, x=10k≈10*0.1547≈1.547.

y=5/(2k)=5/(2*0.1547)=5/0.3094≈16.14.

Check if xy=1.547 *16.14≈25. So, it works out.

But, since the problem states that both x and y are greater than 1, which they are: x≈1.547>1, y≈16.14>1.

So, xy≈25.

Therefore, the answer is 25.


Given the equations $\log_x(y^x) = 10$ and $\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10$, we aim to find the product $xy$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers greater than 1.

First, we use the logarithmic identity $\log_b(a^c) = c \cdot \log_b(a)$ to simplify both equations:

1. $\log_x(y^x) = x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10$  
2. $\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10$

Let $k = \log_y(x)$. Then, $\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{k}$. Substituting these into the equations:

1. $x \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 10 \implies x = 10k$  
2. $4y \cdot k = 10 \implies y = \frac{10}{4k} = \frac{5}{2k}$

Now, we have $x = 10k$ and $y = \frac{5}{2k}$. To find $xy$, we multiply these expressions:

\[
xy = (10k) \cdot \left(\frac{5}{2k}\right) = \frac{50k}{2k} = 25
\]

Thus, the product $xy$ is $\boxed{25}$.
