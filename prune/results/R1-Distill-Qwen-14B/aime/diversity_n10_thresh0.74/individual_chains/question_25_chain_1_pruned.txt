Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, some own a garden spade. The numbers are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Also, it's given that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. We need to find how many own all four—so candy hearts plus the other three.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like a problem that involves sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that the inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Total residents, n(U) = 900
- Number of candy hearts owners: since every resident owns this, it's 900.
- Diamond ring owners, D = 195
- Golf clubs owners, G = 367
- Garden spade owners, S = 562
- Exactly two of the other three items: 437
- Exactly three of the other three items: 234
- We need to find the number who own all four, which would be exactly the intersection of D, G, S, and C (candy hearts). But since everyone owns C, owning all four is just the same as owning D, G, S.

Wait, that's an important point. Since everyone owns a candy heart, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own all three (D, G, S). Because you can't own all four without owning all three. So maybe I need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S|, which is the same as the number of people who own all four.

But let's see. The problem states that 437 own exactly two of the things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these are exclusive counts—people owning exactly two don't overlap with those owning exactly three.

Wait, but what about the number who own all four? If someone owns all four, does that fall under exactly three or exactly four? Hmm, the way the problem is phrased, it says "exactly two" and "exactly three." So, people who own all four are a separate group beyond those who own exactly three. So, in addition to the 234 who own exactly three, there are some who own all four. But the problem doesn't directly give that number. So, I need to find that.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. But since candy hearts are universal, maybe it's similar to three sets. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The total number of residents is the sum of various groups: those who own exactly one item, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. But the problem gives us the counts for exactly two and exactly three. We need to find exactly four. But maybe we can express the total number in terms of these.

Wait, but the
