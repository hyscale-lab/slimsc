Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, they're asking me to find the number of minutes the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, the problem is about calculating time taken for a walk based on different speeds, and then specifically for s + 1/2 km/h. But first, I need to find the values of s and t from the given information.

Let me break this down. The walk is 9 kilometers each time. So, when her speed is s km/h, the total time taken is 4 hours, which includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time (t minutes). Similarly, when her speed is s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, so the total time given includes t minutes. That means the actual walking time is total time minus t minutes. But since the speeds are given in hours, I should probably convert everything to hours or minutes consistently.

Maybe I'll convert t to hours because the speeds are per hour. Let's see.

First scenario:
Speed = s km/h
Total time = 4 hours, which includes walking time and t minutes coffee break.

So, walking time = total time - coffee time. But t is in minutes, so I'll convert it to hours by dividing by 60.

So, walking time = 4 hours - (t/60) hours.

Similarly, the distance is 9 km, so the walking time can be calculated as distance divided by speed. So, walking time = 9 / s hours.

So, from the first scenario, I can write the equation:

9 / s = 4 - (t / 60)

That's equation 1.

Second scenario:
Speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that entirely into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.

So, coffee time is still t minutes, which is t/60 hours.

Walking time = total time - coffee time = 2.4 - (t/60)

And walking time is also 9 / (s + 2) hours.

So, equation 2 is:

9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t / 60)

Now I have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Hmm, looks like I can set up these two equations and solve for s and t.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1:
9/s = 4 - (t/60)

Equation 2:
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1, but perhaps it's better to express t from one equation and substitute into the other.

Let me solve equation 1 for t.

From equation 1:
9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Let me rearrange to solve for t/60.

t/60 = 4 - (9/s)
So, t = 60 * (4 - 9/s)
t = 240 - (540/s)

Now, plug this t into equation 2.

Equation 2:
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Substituting t:
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - [ (240 - (540/s)) / 60 ]

Let me compute [ (240 - (540/s)) / 60 ]:

That's 240/60 - (540/s)/60 = 4 - (9/s)

So, equation 2 becomes:
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - [4 - (9/s)]

Simplify the right side:
2.4 - 4 + (9/s) = (-1.6) + (9/s)

So, equation 2 now:
9/(s + 2) = (-1.6) + (9/s)

Let me write this as:
9/(s + 2) + 1.6 = 9/s

Hmm, perhaps it's better to get rid of the fractions. Let me multiply both sides by s(s + 2) to eliminate denominators.

Multiply each term by s(s + 2):

9 * s + 1.6 * s(s + 2) = 9(s + 2)

Let me compute each term:

9s + 1.6 s (s + 2) = 9(s + 2)

Expanding 1.6 s (s + 2):

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

So, the left side becomes:

9s + 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s = (9 + 3.2) s + 1.6 s^2 = 12.2 s + 1.6 s^2

The right side is:

9s + 18

So, putting it all together:

1.6 s^2 + 12.2 s = 9s + 18

Bring all terms to the left:

1.6 s^2 + 12.2 s - 9s - 18 = 0

Simplify:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in s. Let me write it as:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

To make it easier, perhaps I can multiply all terms by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Simplify by dividing all terms by 4:

4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

Now, the quadratic equation is:

4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

Let me solve this quadratic for s.

Using the quadratic formula:

s = [ -b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4 a c) ] / (2 a)

Where a = 4, b = 8, c = -45.

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 64 - 4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

sqrt(784) = 28

So,

s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (8 )

So, two solutions:

s = ( -8 + 28 ) / 8 = 20 / 8 = 2.5

s = ( -8 - 28 ) / 8 = -36 / 8 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t.

From earlier, t = 240 - (540/s )

s = 2.5, so 540 / 2.5 = 216

So, t = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes.

So, Aya spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop each time.

Now, the question is: When she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her new speed is 3 km/h.

First, the walking time is distance divided by speed: 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

But she also spends t = 24 minutes in the coffee shop. So, total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

But the problem says to find the total time including the coffee shop time, which is 3 hours plus 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. So, total time is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because when she walks at a higher speed, her walking time decreases, but she still spends the same amount of time in the coffee shop. So, yes, the total time is walking time plus t.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total time as (time walking) + t.

Time walking at 3 km/h is 9 / 3 = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Plus 24 minutes coffee: 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

But let me double-check my calculations.

First, with s = 2.5 km/h:

Time walking: 9 / 2.5 =
