Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a list of positive integers with specific properties. We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Hmm, let's break down the given information first.

First, the sum of the items is 30. That's straightforward. Next, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently, and it's unique, so no other number can appear as many times as 9. Then, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Interesting. So, the median is not part of the list itself.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the median part correctly. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. For an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. For even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But here, the median is a positive integer and it's not in the list. Hmm. So, if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be an average of two numbers, which could be a non-integer, but the problem says the median is a positive integer. So, it must be that the average of the two middle numbers is a whole number, but that number itself isn't present in the list.

Let me try to outline what we know:

1. Sum of the list: 30.
2. Mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number.
3. Median is an integer not present in the list.

Our goal is to find the sum of the squares of all items.

I think the first step is to figure out the possible length of the list. Let's denote the number of elements as n.

Since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear at least twice. But to be the mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times. But let's see.

Also, the median being an integer not in the list. Let's think about possible n.

Case 1: n is odd. Let's say n = 2k + 1. Then the median is the (k+1)th term. If this term is not in the list, that means when arranged in order, the middle element is a number that's not present. But wait, all elements are positive integers. So, if the median is a positive integer not in the list, how is that possible? Because the median is the middle element, which is part of the list. Wait, that seems conflicting. So, maybe n is even.

Ah yes, if n is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So, if those two middle numbers are such that their average is an integer not present in the list, that's possible.

For example, suppose the two middle numbers are x and y, and (x + y)/2 is an integer not in the list. So, x and y must be two numbers such that their sum is even, making the average an integer. But that integer isn't in the list.

Okay, so n must be even because if n were odd, the median would be a term
