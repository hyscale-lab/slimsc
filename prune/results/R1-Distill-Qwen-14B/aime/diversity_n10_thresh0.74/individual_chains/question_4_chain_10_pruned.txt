Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make it so that Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. It sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, Bob wants the starting position n to be a losing position for Alice. That way, no matter what Alice does, Bob can always respond in a way that leads him to victory.

So, I think the key is to figure out for which n the starting player (Alice) is in a losing position. Those n's are the ones where Bob can win.

Let me try to model this. I'll start by considering small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's list n from 1 upwards and mark whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So Bob can't win when n=1. So n=1 is a W for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice doesn't want to do that. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2, she can't take 4. So she can only take 1. So she takes 1, leaves 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Bob wins when n=2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the last token wins. So if Alice takes 1, leaving 1, Bob takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2: Bob can win.

Wait, let me get this straight: for each n, if the current player can make a move that forces the next player into a losing position, then n is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

So let me try to make a table.

n | Winner (if both play optimally)
--- | ---
1 | Alice (she takes 1 and wins)
2 | Bob (Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins)
3 | Alice takes 1, leaving 2 for Bob, who then is in a losing position. So Alice can win by taking 1. So n=3 is a W for Alice.
Wait, wait a second. Let me think again.

Wait, if n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win at n=2.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. Since n=2 is a losing position for Bob, meaning he can't win. Wait, no. Wait, in n=2, the player whose turn it is can lose if the opponent plays optimally. So if Alice leaves Bob with n=2, which is a losing position for Bob, that means Bob can't win. Wait, no, wait. If Alice leaves Bob with n=2, which is a losing position for Bob, that would mean that Bob can't force a win, so Alice can. So n=3 is a winning position for Alice.

Wait, let me clarify the terminology. A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. So, for n=1: taking 1 leads to 0, which is a losing position for the next player (since you can't move). Wait, but in our case, taking the last token wins. So if you take the last token, you win. So n=1, the player takes 1 and wins. So n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: the player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So the player at n=2 can't force a win, so n=2 is a losing position.

n=3: the player can take 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So n=3 is a winning position.

n=4: the player can take 4 tokens and win. So n=4 is a winning position.

n=5: the player can take 1, leaving 4 for the opponent, who can then take 4 and win. Alternatively, the player can take 4, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So both options leave the opponent to win. So n=5 is a losing position.

n=6: the player
