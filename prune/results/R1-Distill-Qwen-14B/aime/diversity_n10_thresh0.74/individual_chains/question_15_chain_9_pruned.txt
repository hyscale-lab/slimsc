Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which I think means they go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, moving only right or up. And the catch is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, interesting. 

Let me try to visualize this. An 8x8 grid would have 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So to get from the lower left to the upper right, you'd need to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Each path is a sequence of these moves, and each time you switch from moving right to up or vice versa is a change in direction. So, for example, if you start by moving right, then change to up after a few steps, that's one change. Then, if you change back to right, that's another, and so on.

So the problem is asking for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. I remember that in combinatorics, the number of paths with a certain number of direction changes can be calculated using some kind of combinatorial approach, maybe involving combinations or permutations.

Let me think about how direction changes work. Each direction change must occur between two consecutive steps. So, for a path of length 16, there are 15 possible points where a direction change could occur. But we don't want all possible combinations; we need exactly four changes. 

Wait, but how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of runs? A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move, right? So, if a path changes direction four times, that means it has five runs. For example, starting with right, then up, then right, then up, then right, etc.—each switch is a new run. So, for four direction changes, we have five runs.

Now, each run must consist of at least one step, right? Because a run can't be zero length. So, if I have five runs, each run is either a sequence of right moves or up moves. Since we need to cover 8 right moves and 8 up moves in total, the sum of the lengths of the right runs must be 8, and the same for the up runs.

But also, the runs alternate between right and up. So, whether the first run is right or up, the next is the other direction, and so on. So, if there are five runs, and the first run is right, then the runs go R, U, R, U, R. Similarly, if the first run is up, it would be U, R, U, R, U. So, depending on the starting direction, the number of runs of each type will be different.

Wait, so in five runs, starting with right, there are three right runs and two up runs. Starting with up, it's the opposite: three up runs and two right runs. Hmm, because 5 is odd, so one direction will have three runs and the other two. 

So, for each case—starting with right or starting with up—we can compute the number of such paths and then add them together. Because the problem doesn't specify the starting direction, both cases are valid.

So, let's break this down. Let's first consider the case where the first run is to the right. Then, as per above, there are three right runs and two up runs. Each right run has a length of at least 1, and the sum of all right runs is 8. Similarly, each up run has a length of at least 1, and their sum is 8.

This is similar to a stars and bars problem. For the right runs, we have three runs, each at least 1, summing to 8. The number of ways to distribute this is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2). Similarly, for the up runs, two runs, each at least 1, summing to 8, it's C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1).

Wait, so for the right runs: the number
