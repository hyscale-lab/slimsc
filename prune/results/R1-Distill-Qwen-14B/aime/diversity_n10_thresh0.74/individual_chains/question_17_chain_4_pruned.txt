Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain such a box, and then compute r², express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length (let's say x), width (y), and height (z). The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume is xyz. So, according to the problem, 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The sphere that can contain a rectangular box is called the circumscribed sphere, and its radius is equal to half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d can be found using the formula d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r would be d/2, so r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, our goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume. So, we need to minimize x² + y² + z² with the conditions:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

This is an optimization problem with constraints. I think I should use methods from calculus, probably Lagrange multipliers, to find the minimum.

Let me recall: with Lagrange multipliers, if I have a function to minimize f(x,y,z) subject to constraints g(x,y,z) = 0 and h(x,y,z)=0, I can set up equations using gradients.

In this case, f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z²
Constraints:
g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0
h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0

Set up the Lagrangian: L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x:
2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0
Similarly, ∂L/∂y:
2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z:
2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz =27
xyz=23

So now, we have a system of 5 equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)
4. xy + yz + xz =27
5. xyz=23

Hmm, this looks complicated, but perhaps we can assume symmetry. Maybe the minimal sphere occurs when the box is a cube? Wait, but for a cube, all sides are equal, so x=y=z. Let me check if that's possible.

If x=y=z=a, then surface area is 6a²=54 → a²=9 → a=3. Volume would be a³=27. But in our case, volume is 23, so it's not a cube. So, the minimal sphere probably isn't achieved by a cube. So, maybe the box isn't a cube, but perhaps two sides are equal, making it a square prism or something? Maybe x=y≠z.

Let me suppose x=y. So, let’s set x = y = a, and z = b. Then, the surface area becomes 2(a² + 2ab) = 54 → a² + 2ab =27. The volume is a²b=23.

So, now, we have two equations:

a² + 2ab =27 ...(1)
a²b =23 ...(2)

From equation (2), b = 23/(a²). Substitute into equation (1):

a² + 2a*(23/(a²)) =27 → a² + (46/a) =27.

Multiply both sides by a:

a³ + 46 =27a → a³ -27a +46=0.

Hmm, need to solve this cubic equation: a³ -27a +46 =0.

Let me try rational roots. The possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Test a=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0
a=2:8 -54 +46=0 → 0. Yay! So a=2 is a root. So we can factor this as (a-2)(a² +2a -23)=0.

So, the other roots are solutions to a² +2a -23=0 → a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6). Since a must be positive, a= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible a values are 2, -1+2√6, and the other negative one which we can ignore.

So, let's check a=2 first.

If a=2, then from equation (2), b=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the dimensions would be x=y=2, z=5.75.

Wait, let's compute x² + y² + z²:

2² +2² + (23/4)² = 4+4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625=41.0625= 41.0625. So, r²=41.0625/4=10.265625. Hmm, let's see what the other a gives.

If a= -1 +2√6≈3.898, then b=23/(a²). Let me compute a²:

a= -1 +2√6, so a²= (1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2) =1 -4√6 +24=25-4√6.

So, b= 23/(25 -4√6). Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

b=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^
