Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle setup. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. That means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω passes through all three points. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is called the exsymmedian point or something like that? Maybe not. Anyway, D is outside the circle, and AD intersects ω again at P. So P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle.

I remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, the tangent-tangent theorem says that the lengths from the external point to the points of tangency are equal. So, from point D, the lengths DB and DC are equal because they are both tangents to ω from D. So DB = DC. That might be useful.

Now, perhaps I can find some properties or theorems related to this configuration. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, it must lie on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Wait, or is it related to the Gergonne or Nagel point? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think about the power of a point. 

Yes, point D lies outside the circle, and the power of D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC², which are equal. The power of D is also equal to DB * DC, but since DB = DC, it's DB².

Wait, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². Also, since AD intersects ω at A and P, the power of D can also be expressed as DA * DP. So, according to the power of a point theorem:

DB² = DA * DP.

That seems important. So if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA? Wait, no, because DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So AP would be DP - DA? Hmm, wait no, because A is on the circle, so DA is the length from D to A, and then P is another point on the circle, so DP is the length from D to P. Since D is outside the circle, DA is the external part, and AP is the chord. So the length AP would be equal to DP - DA? Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

No, actually, the power of point D is equal to DA *
