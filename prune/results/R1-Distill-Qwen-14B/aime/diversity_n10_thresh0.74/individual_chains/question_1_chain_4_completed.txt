Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, and z. Hmm, let me see. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴ y³ z²), which will be a fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:
log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, interesting. So if I let a = log₂(x), b = log₂(y), and c = log₂(z), then the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

Now I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can try solving this system.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I think I'll add all three equations together to see if that helps. Adding equation 1, 2, and 3:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Let me compute the left side:

a - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c = combine like terms.

a - a - a = -a.

-b + b - b = -b.

-c - c + c = -c.

So altogether: -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.

Wait, but on the right side, let's compute the sum:

1/2 is 6/12, 1/3 is 4/12, 1/4 is 3/12. So 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.

So, -a - b - c = 13/12.

But that's interesting. Now, if I can find a, b, c individually, then I can compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) as 4a + 3b + 2c.

Wait, let me make sure. Because x⁴ y³ z² would have exponents 4,3,2 on x,y,z, so log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z = 4a + 3b + 2c.

So we need to find 4a + 3b + 2c in absolute value.

But first, let's solve for a, b, c.

We have:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

And from adding all three, we have:

-a - b - c = 13/12 --> Equation 4.

So, equation 4: -a - b - c = 13/12.

Now, let's see if we can express other equations in terms of equation 4.

Looking back to equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2.

If I add equation 1 and equation 4:

(a - b - c) + (-a - b - c) = 1/2 + 13/12.

Simplify left side:

a -a cancels. Then -b - b = -2b. -c -c = -2c.

So left side: -2b -2c = (1/2 + 13/12).

Convert 1/2 to 6/12, so 6/12 +13/12=19/12.

So: -2b -2c = 19/12.

Divide both sides by -2:

b + c = -19/24 --> Equation 5.

Similarly, let's take equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3.

Add equation 2 and equation 4:

(-a + b - c) + (-a - b - c) = 1/3 + 13/12.

Left side:

- a -a = -2a.

b - b = 0.

- c - c = -2c.

So left side: -2a -2c = 1/3 +13/12.

Convert 1/3 to 4/12, so 4/12 +13/12=17/12.

Thus: -2a -2c = 17/12.

Divide both sides by -2:

a + c = -17/24 --> Equation 6.

Similarly, take equation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.

Add equation 3 and equation4:

(-a - b + c) + (-a - b -c) =1/4 +13/12.

Left side:

- a -a = -2a.

- b - b = -2b.

c - c = 0.

So left side: -2a -2b = (1/4 +13/12).

Convert 1/4 to 3/12, so 3/12 +13/12=16/12=4/3.

Thus: -2a -2b=4/3.

Divide both sides by -2:

a + b = -2/3 --> Equation7.

Now, we have:

Equation5: b + c = -19/24.

Equation6: a + c = -17/24.

Equation7: a + b = -2/3.

So, let's see. Let's write equation7 as a + b = -8/12 = -24/36? Wait, maybe it's better to express variables in terms.

From equation7: a = -2/3 - b.

From equation5: c = -19/24 - b.

From equation6: a + c = -17/24.

Substitute a and c from above into equation6.

a + c = (-2/3 - b) + (-19/24 - b) = (-2/3 -19/24) -2b.

Calculate -2/3 -19/24:

Convert 2/3 to 16/24, so it's -16/24 -19/24= -35/24.

Thus, (-35/24 -2b) = -17/24.

So:

-35/24 -2b = -17/24.

Add 35/24 to both sides:

-2b = (-17/24 +35/24) =18/24=3/4.

So, -2b=3/4 --> b= -3/(4*2)= -3/8.

So, b= -3/8.

Now, from equation7: a = -2/3 -b = -2/3 - (-3/8) = -2/3 +3/8.

Convert to common denominator, 24:

-2/3 is -16/24, 3/8 is 9/24.

So, a= -16/24 +9/24= -7/24.

And from equation5: c= -19/24 -b = -19/24 - (-3/8)= -19/24 +3/8.

Convert 3/8 to 9/24:

c= -19/24 +9/24= -10/24= -5/12.

So, a= -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made an error.

Wait, equation7: a + b = -2/3, which is -8/12.

So if b= -3/8= -9/24, then a= -8/12 - (-3/8).

Wait, maybe I should recompute a.

Wait, it's probably better to recompute a, b, c step by step.

We have:

Equation7: a + b = -2/3.

Equation5: b + c= -19/24.

Equation6: a + c= -17/24.

From equation7: a = -2/3 - b.

From equation5: c= -19/24 -b.

Substituting into equation6:

a + c= (-2/3 -b) + (-19/24 -b) = (-2/3 -19/24) -2b = (-16/24 -19/24) -2b= (-35/24) -2b= -17/24.

So, -35/24 -2b= -17/24.

Adding 35/24 to both sides: -2b= (-17 +35)/24=18/24=3/4.

So, -2b=3/4 --> b= -3/8. Correct.

Then, a= -2/3 - (-3/8)= -2/3 +3/8.

Find a common denominator, which is 24.

-2/3= -16/24, 3/8=9/24.

So, a= -16/24 +9/24= -7/24. Correct.

c= -19/24 - (-3/8)= -19/24 + 9/24= -10/24= -5/12. Correct.

So, a= -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.

Now, we need to compute 4a +3b +2c.

Compute each term:

4a=4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6.

3b=3*(-3/8)= -9/8.

2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6.

Now, sum them up:

-7/6 + (-9/8) + (-5/6).

Combine the terms:

First, let's convert all to 24 as a common denominator.

-7/6= -28/24.

-9/8= -27/24.

-5/6= -20/24.

So, sum= (-28 -27 -20)/24= (-75)/24.

Simplify: 75 and 24 share a common factor of 3: 75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8.

So, -75/24= -25/8.

The absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8.

So, 25/8 is the value. The problem states that it's m/n where m and n are coprime, so m=25, n=8. m+n=33.

Wait, but let me verify the sum again because I might have made a mistake in adding.

Wait, 4a is -7/6, 3b is -9/8, 2c is -5/6.

So, adding them: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).

Let me group the 7/6 and 5/6:

(-7/6 -5/6)= (-12/6)= -2.

Then, -2 + (-9/8)= -2 -9/8= (-16/8 -9/8)= -25/8.

Yes, so that's correct. So the absolute value is 25/8. So m=25, n=8, m +n=33.

I think that's the correct answer.


To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into a system of linear equations using the substitution \( a = \log_2(x) \), \( b = \log_2(y) \), and \( c = \log_2(z) \). This gives us the following system:

\[
\begin{cases}
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} \\
-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3} \\
-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

Adding all three equations, we find:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Next, we solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) by manipulating the equations. From the first equation:

\[
a = \frac{1}{2} + b + c
\]

Substituting this into the second equation and simplifying, we find \( b = -\frac{3}{8} \). Using this value, we substitute back to find \( a = -\frac{7}{24} \) and \( c = -\frac{5}{12} \).

The expression we need to evaluate is \( \left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| \), which translates to \( |4a + 3b + 2c| \). Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}
\]

Converting to a common denominator and simplifying:

\[
-\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value gives \( \frac{25}{8} \). Thus, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), leading to \( m + n = 33 \).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
