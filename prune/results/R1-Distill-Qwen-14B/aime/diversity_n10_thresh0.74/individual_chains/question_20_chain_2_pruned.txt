Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out the number of ways to place chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read it again and make sure I understand the conditions.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of these chips in the 25 cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. The two main conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must have the same color.
2. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, the first thing I'm thinking is that each row and each column must be monochromatic, meaning all chips in a row or column are either all white or all black. But wait, the second condition says that we can't place any more chips without violating the first condition. So, that implies that the configuration is such that every possible cell that could have a chip is already filled according to the rules.

Let me break it down.

First, each row can be either all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or have no chips. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Each row can have any number of chips, but all the chips in that row must be the same color. So, for a row, we can have some white chips or some black chips, but not a mix. Similarly for columns.

But the problem adds another condition: any additional chip placed would violate the conditions. That suggests that the placement is maximal in some sense. So, if I tried to add another chip, it would have to go into a cell that's either in a row or column that already has a different color, which isn't allowed.

So, perhaps this configuration is such that for every cell that's empty, both its row and column are completely empty. Because if the row or column was partially filled, then I could add a chip of the same color without violating the first condition.

Wait, no. If a row is partially filled, say with white chips, then a column that intersects this row is either all white, all black, or empty. If it's empty, then I could place a white chip in that row and column, but since the row already has white chips, the column would then have a white chip.
