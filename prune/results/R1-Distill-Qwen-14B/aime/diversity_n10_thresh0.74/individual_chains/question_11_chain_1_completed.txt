Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if its magnitude is 4, then z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can also write z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). That might come in handy later.

The expression we're dealing with is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Since z has a magnitude of 4, 1/z would have a magnitude of 1/4. So, 1/z is just the conjugate of z divided by |z| squared, right? Wait, let me think. Actually, for any complex number z, 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by |z| squared. So, since |z| is 4, |z| squared is 16. Therefore, 1/z = (z̄)/16.

So, maybe I can rewrite the expression in terms of z and z̄. Let's see:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) * (z̄)/16.

Hmm, that might not be too bad. Alternatively, I could express both terms with z and 1/z, but I'm not sure yet. Let me proceed.

Wait, another approach: since z is on the circle with radius 4, maybe I can let z = 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, substituting these into the expression, I can write everything in terms of θ.

Let me try that. So, z = 4e^{iθ}, and 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Substituting into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Simplify each term:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i) e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.
Second term: (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, that looks a bit better, but still complicated. Maybe I can express each term using Euler's formula, which would separate them into real and imaginary parts.

Euler's formula says that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's expand both terms:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Let me multiply these out.

Starting with the first term:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i + 468 (-1) sinθ
= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)

Similarly, the second term:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i + 36 sinθ
= (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)

Now, adding both terms together:

Real parts:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So, the entire expression is:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)

But we're interested in the real part of this expression. So, the real part is:

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ as θ varies over all real numbers.

Hmm, okay, that seems manageable. I remember that the expression a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of this expression is R, so the maximum real part here will be sqrt(324^2 + 432^2).

Wait, let me double-check that. So, the maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is indeed sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So, in this case, a is 324 and b is -432. So, R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2:

324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and cross term is 2*300*24=14,400. So, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 90,000 +14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2. Let's compute that:

400^2 = 160,000. 32^2=1,024. Cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 +32)^2=400^2 +2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 160,000 +25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Let's see:

500^2 is 250,000. 600^2 is 360,000. So, it's somewhere in between. Let's try 540: 540^2 = 291,600. Exactly. So, R=540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let's verify R:

Compute 324^2: 324*324. Let me compute 324*300 = 97,200, 324*24=7,776. So, total is 97,200 +7,776=104,976. Correct.

432^2: 432*432. Let me compute 400*400=160,000, 32*400=12,800, 400*32=12,800, 32*32=1,024. So, (400+32)^2=400^2 +2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +2*12,800 +1,024=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624. Correct.

So, 104,976 + 186,624=291,600. sqrt(291,600)=540. Correct.

So, the maximum real part is 540. Therefore, the answer is 540.

But wait, just to make sure, is there a chance I missed a step? Let me think again.

We started by expressing z as 4e^{iθ} and 1/z as (1/4)e^{-iθ}, then substituted both into the expression, expanded, and collected real parts. That part seems correct.

Another way to check: maybe I can represent the expression as a real function in θ and then take the derivative to find the maximum. But that might be more complicated, but let's try.

Let me denote f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We can find the maximum by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

f'(θ) = -324 sinθ -432 cosθ.

Set f'(θ)=0:

-324 sinθ -432 cosθ =0

Which implies:

-324 sinθ = 432 cosθ

Divide both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠0):

-324 tanθ =432

tanθ = -432/324 = -16/12 = -4/3.

So, θ = arctangent of -4/3. So, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant.

Now, to find the maximum value, plug this θ back into f(θ):

f(θ) =324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

But without knowing the exact value of θ, it's tricky. Alternatively, we can use the formula for the maximum of a linear combination of sine and cosine, which is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So, in this case, a=324, b=-432, so it's sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=540, as before.

So, that confirms it. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.


The largest possible real part of the given expression is achieved when the real part is maximized. By expressing \( z \) in polar form and simplifying the expression, the real part reduces to \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \). The maximum value of this expression is the magnitude \( \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540 \).

\[
\boxed{540}
