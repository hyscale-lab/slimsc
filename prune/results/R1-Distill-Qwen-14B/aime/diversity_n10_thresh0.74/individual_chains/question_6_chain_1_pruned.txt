Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It involves functions f(x) and g(x), which are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I should probably understand what the functions f and g look like. Since both involve absolute values, they're likely piecewise linear functions with corners at certain points.

Let me sketch f(x) first. f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So, let's think about |x| first. The graph of |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2: |x| - 1/2 shifts this V down by 1/2. But since we have absolute value again, ||x| - 1/2|, any negative parts will be flipped back up.

So, the function |x| - 1/2 is zero when |x| = 1/2, which happens at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. For |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so the absolute value makes it positive: 1/2 - |x|. For |x| ≥ 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is positive, so it remains as is. Therefore, f(x) will have a W shape, with minima at x = ±1/2 and x=0 being a maximum.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that. The inner function is |x| - 1/4, which is zero at |x|=1/4, so x=1/4 and x=-1/4. For |x| < 1/4, it's 1/4 - |x|, and for |x| ≥1/4, it's |x| -1/4. So, g(x) will also have a W shape, but with minima at x = ±1/4 and a maximum at x=0.

Now, f and g are both transformations of |x|, so they're even functions, symmetric about the y-axis.

Next, the functions in the problem are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, both y and x are expressed in terms of these composite functions. Since both equations involve g(f(...)), let me first figure out what g(f(...)) looks like.

Let me denote h(t) = g(f(t)).

So, h(t) = g(f(t)) = ||f(t)| - 1/4|. Wait, but f(t) is ||t| - 1/2|, so it's non-negative. Therefore, |f(t)| is just f(t). So, h(t) = |f(t) - 1/4|.

So, h(t) = | ||t| - 1/2| - 1/4 |.

Hmm, that's a nested absolute value function. Let me try to simplify this.

Let me first compute f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|. As I thought earlier, f(t) has a W shape. For |t| ≤1/2, f(t)=1/2 - |t|. For |t| ≥1/2, f(t)= |t| -1/2.

So, h(t) = |f(t) - 1/4|.

Let's consider different cases based on the value of |t|.

Case 1: |t| ≤1/2. Then, f(t)=1/2 - |t|. So h(t) = |(1/2 - |t|) - 1/4| = |1/4 - |t||.

Case 2: 1/2 ≤|t| ≤ 3/2. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, f(t) for |t| ≥1/2 is |t| -1/2. So then, h(t) = |(|t| -1/2) -1/4| = ||t| - 3/4|.

Wait, but when is f(t) = |t| -1/2? When |t| ≥1/2. So, h(t) becomes ||t| -1/2 -1/4| = ||t| - 3/4|.

So, depending on |t|, h(t) can be either |1/4 - |t|| when |t| ≤1/2, or ||t| - 3/4| when |t| ≥1/2.

Wait, but let's check that. For |t| ≤1/2: h(t) = |1/4 - |t||. For |t| ≥1/2: h(t) = | |t| -3/4 |.

But wait, 3/4 is greater than 1/2, so for |t| ≥3/4, ||t| - 3/4| is |t| -3/4. For 1/2 ≤ |t| <3/4, ||t| -3/4| is 3/4 -|t|.

So, putting it all together:

h(t) = |1/4 - |t||, when |t| ≤1/2,

h(t) = 3/4 - |t|, when 1/2 ≤ |t| ≤3/4,

h(t) = |t| -3/4, when |t| ≥3/4.

So, h(t) is a piecewise function with different expressions in different intervals.

Let me plot this mentally. For |t| from 0 to 1/4, h(t) = 1/4 - |t|, which is decreasing from 1/4 to 0. At |t|=1/4, h(t)=0.

Then, from |t|=1/4 to |t|=1/2, h(t)= |1/4 - |t||
