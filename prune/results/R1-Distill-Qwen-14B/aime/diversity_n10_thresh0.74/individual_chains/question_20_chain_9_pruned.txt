Okay, so I have this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Additionally, if I add any more chips, it would break one of these conditions. I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. Each row has to be all one color, and each column has to be all one color. That means each row is either all white or all black, and the same for each column. Wait, but if a row is all white, then for the columns that intersect this row, those columns must also be white? Or can they be different?

Wait, no, because if a row is all white, then every column that passes through that row must have a white chip. So, if a column has at least one white chip, then all chips in that column must be white. Similarly, if a row has any black chip, then all chips in that row must be black.

So, it seems like each row and each column must be entirely white or entirely black. But this leads to a problem because if a row is white, then all the columns in that row must be white as well. So, if I have some rows as white and some as black, how does that affect the columns?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the entire grid. Let's say that some rows are white, and others are black. Similarly, some columns are white, and others are black. But wait, if a row is white, then all the columns that it intersects must be white as well, otherwise, you can't have a white row and a black column intersecting because that would require a white and a black chip in the same cell, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose a row is white. Then every column that intersects this row must have a white chip, but a column could be all white or all black. If the column is all white, then that's fine. But if the column is all black, then the intersection with the white row would require a black chip, but the row is white, so that's a contradiction. So, if a row is white, all the columns that intersect
