Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on set theory, but I'll give it a go.

The problem states: There are 900 residents total. 

- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- Every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's 900 people owning that.

Then, there are some additional numbers: 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.

Hmm, right. So, the four items are diamond ring (let's call this D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Wait, but actually, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So that means C is owned by everyone. So C is a universal set here.

Wait, so all the residents have C. So when considering the other items, D, G, S, each can be combined with C.

But I need to find the number who own all four, which would be the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since everyone has C, that's the same as the intersection of D, G, and S.

Wait, no. Because if someone owns all four, it's the same as owning D, G, S, and C. But since C is owned by everyone, it doesn't affect the count beyond D, G, and S. So the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own D, G, and S.

Wait, but maybe I should model this with the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's recall that principle.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is a bit complicated, but since one of the sets (C) is universal, maybe it simplifies things. But perhaps it's better to model all four and see.

Wait, but let me think again. Since everyone owns C, the total number of people is equal to the number of people owning C, which is 900. So, the other three items (D, G, S) are subsets of the 900. So maybe we can model this as three sets within a universal set of 900.

But wait, let's see. The problem gives the counts for D, G, S, and C is 900. So, perhaps we can ignore C for the purposes of inclusion-exclusion and just model D, G, S, because C is universal. But then, the problem is about four items, so perhaps I should treat all four.

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to approach this systematically.

The problem gives:

- Total residents: 900
- |D| = 195
- |G| = 367
- |S| = 562
- |C| = 900 (since everyone has it)
- Number of people owning exactly two things: 437
- Number owning exactly three things: 234
- Number owning all four: ?

Wait, but let me think about the possible overlaps. Since C is owned by everyone, any combination involving C would include it. So, for example, the number of people who own D and C is just |D|, which is 195. Similarly for G and S.

Wait, but the problem is about exactly two, exactly three, etc. So, for exactly two, it would be the number of people who own exactly two of the four items, which includes C. But since everyone owns C, the only way someone can own exactly two items is if they own C plus exactly one other thing. Because if you own C and another thing, that's two. But wait, no, because the problem says "exactly two of these things," which would include C. Wait no, because each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so C is always present. Therefore, when the problem says someone owns exactly two things, that must include C and exactly one more. Similarly, exactly three would include C and two more, and exactly four would include C and all three others.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the four things are C, D, G, S, and each resident owns at least C. So, the only possible way a resident can own exactly two things is if they own C and exactly one other (either D, G, or S). Similarly, owning exactly three would mean C plus two others, and exactly four would be all four.

Wait, that's correct. So, the counts given in the problem:

- Exactly two: 437. So these are the people who own C plus exactly one of D, G, or S.

- Exactly three: 234. These own C plus exactly two of D, G, S.

- Exactly four: let's denote this as x. These own C plus D, G, and S.

So the total number of residents is 900, and this would be the sum of:

- Those who own exactly one thing (but since C is mandatory, the only possible 'exactly one' is owning only C. Wait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but does it say they own only C? No, it just says each owns C. So perhaps some people own only C, some own C and one other, etc.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people who own exactly one thing. Hmm, maybe I need to model this correctly.

Wait, let me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. But since C is universal, perhaps it's easier to model the other three sets within the universal set of 900.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the union of D, G, S, and C. But since C is everyone, the union is just 900. So, perhaps I can model the problem without considering C in the inclusion-exclusion, but then I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, maybe I can model the number of residents as the sum of those owning exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 items.

Wait, so total residents = number owning exactly 1 + exactly 2 + exactly 3 + exactly 4.

But since C is always owned, the "exactly 1" would be those who only own C. Similarly, exactly 2 would be C plus one other, exactly 3 would be C plus two others, and exactly 4 would be all four.

But the problem doesn't give the number of people owning exactly one thing. Hmm, so perhaps I can express the total as:

Total = (only C) + (C and exactly one other) + (C and exactly two others) + (C and all three others).

But the problem gives us:

- Exactly two: 437 → this would be C plus exactly one other (so, 437 people)
- Exactly three: 234 → C plus exactly two others
- Exactly four: x → C plus all three others

And (only C) is another group. Let's call that y. So:

Total = y + 437 + 234 + x = 900.

So, y + x + 437 + 234 = 900 → y + x = 900 - 437 -234 = let me calculate that.

437 + 234 = 671 → 900 - 671 = 229 → so y + x = 229.

But I don't know y yet. Hmm, but I need another equation to find x.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets D, G, S, considering that everyone has C.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem without considering C for inclusion-exclusion, but since C is universal, maybe the inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S would be:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| would be the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone owns C, and C is separate.

Wait, but the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the total number of people minus those who own only C. Because if someone owns at least one of D, G, or S, they own those plus C. So |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - y, where y is the number of people who own only C.

So, 900 - y = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

But wait, I don't know |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S|, or |D∩G∩S|. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem gives us the number of people who own exactly two and exactly three of the four items. But since C is always present, maybe I can express the pairwise intersections in terms of exactly two and exactly three.

Wait, let me think: the number of people owning exactly two items would include C. So, for example, the number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which would be the sum of the people owning C and D only, C and G only, C and S only.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three items is 234, which would be C plus any two of D, G, S.

And the number of people owning all four is x, which is C, D, G, S.

So, perhaps the intersections can be expressed in terms of these numbers.

Let me denote:

- a: number of people owning C and D only → this contributes to exactly two items.
- b: number owning C and G only.
- c: number owning C and S only.
- d: number owning C, D, G only → contributes to exactly three items.
- e: number owning C, D, S only.
- f: number owning C, G, S only.
- g: number owning C, D, G, S → which is x, the number we're looking for.

Wait, but in the problem, the counts are:

- Exactly two: 437. So that would include a + b + c = 437.

- Exactly three: 234. So that would include d + e + f = 234.

- Exactly four: x → which is g.

And the number of people owning only C is y, as before.

So, the total is y + (a+b+c) + (d+e+f) + g = y + 437 + 234 + x = 900 → which we had earlier, leading to y + x = 229.

But how does this help with the inclusion-exclusion?

Well, the inclusion-exclusion formula for D, G, S would give us:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| is equal to (900 - y), as they're the people who own at least one of D, G, or S, which includes all the people except those who own only C.

Now, let's express |D|, |G|, |S| in terms of the variables.

|D| is the number of people owning D, which includes:

- a (C and D only)
- d (C, D, G)
- e (C, D, S)
- g (C, D, G, S)

So, |D| = a + d + e + g = 195.

Similarly,

|G| = b + d + f + g = 367.

|S| = c + e + f + g = 562.

Now, the pairwise intersections:

|D∩G| is the number of people owning both D and G, which includes:

- d (C, D, G)
- g (all four)

So, |D∩G| = d + g.

Similarly,

|D∩S| = e + g.

|G∩S| = f + g.

And |D∩G∩S| is g, the number of people who own all four.

So, substituting into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 - y = |D| + |G| + |S| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|

Plugging in the values:

900 - y = (195) + (367) + (562) - [(d + g) + (e + g) + (f + g)] + g.

Let me compute the sum of |D| + |G| + |S|: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, no, wait. 195 + 367 = 562? Let me compute that properly.

195 + 367: 195 + 300 = 495; 495 + 67 = 562. Yes. Then 562 + 562 = 1124? No, wait: 195 + 367 = 562, and then 562 + 562 = 1124.

Wait, no, wait: |D| is 195, |G| is 367, |S| is 562. So 195 + 367 = 562, plus 562 is 1124. So the sum is 1124.

Now, the sum of the pairwise intersections |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| is:

(d + g) + (e + g) + (f + g) = d + e + f + 3g.

So, putting it all together:

900 - y = 1124 - (d + e + f + 3g) + g.

Simplify:

900 - y = 1124 - d - e - f - 3g + g → 1124 - d - e - f - 2g.

But we know that d + e + f = 234 (since exactly three items, which includes C and two others). So, d + e + f = 234.

So substituting:

900 - y = 1124 - 234 - 2g.

Compute 1124 - 234: 1124 - 200 = 924; 924 - 34 = 890.

So, 900 - y = 890 - 2g.

Rearranging:

900 - y = 890 - 2g → 900 - 890 = y - 2g → 10 = y - 2g → y = 10 + 2g.

But earlier, from the total, we had y + x = 229. And since x is g, then y = 229 - g.

Wait no, wait: Wait, in the problem statement, the 'exactly four' is the number of people who own all four, which is g. So x = g.

So, y + x = 229 → y + g = 229.

But from the inclusion-exclusion, we have y = 10 + 2g.

So substituting into y + g = 229:

(10 + 2g) + g = 229 → 10 + 3g = 229 → 3g = 219 → g = 73.

So, the number of people who own all four items is 73. So x = 73.

Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

From inclusion-exclusion, we had:

900 - y = 1124 - (d + e + f + 3g) + g → 1124 - (234 + 3g) + g → 1124 -234 -2g → 890 -2g.

So, 900 - y = 890 - 2g → y = 10 + 2g.

And from the total, y + g = 229. So substituting:

10 + 2g + g = 229 → 10 + 3g = 229 → 3g = 219 → g = 73.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the ownership of the four items (C, D, G, S), where C is universal. 

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Total residents: 900.
   - |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900.
   - Exactly two items: 437.
   - Exactly three items: 234.
   - Exactly four items: x (to find).

2. **Breakdown of Ownership:**
   - Exactly two items: 437 people own C plus one other (D, G, or S).
   - Exactly three items: 234 people own C plus two others.
   - Exactly four items: x people own all four.

3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   Apply the principle to D, G, S within the universal set of 900 (since everyone owns C):
   \[
   |D \cup G \cup S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap S| - |G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap S|
   \]
   Since |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - y (where y is the number of people owning only C), we substitute:
   \[
   900 - y = 195 + 367 + 562 - (d + g + e + g + f + g) + g
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   900 - y = 1124 - (234 + 2g) \implies y = 10 + 2g
   \]

4. **Solve for x (g):**
   From the total:
   \[
   y + g = 229 \implies (10 + 2g) + g = 229 \implies 3g = 219 \implies g = 73
   \]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is **73**.

\boxed{73}
