Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, which is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when the torus is outside, they are tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on torus properties, but let me think. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, the minor radius is 3 because the circle being revolved has a radius of 3. The major radius R is the distance from the axis of revolution to the center of the original circle, which is 6. So R = 6 and r = 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus can rest inside or outside the sphere, and in each case, they are tangent along a circle. I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then find their difference.

Let me visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus must fit snugly inside. The point of tangency is a circle, which means all points along that circle are equidistant from the sphere's center and lie on the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they touch along another circle.

I remember that for a torus, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube (which is the major radius) plus or minus the minor radius will affect how it sits inside or outside the sphere. But I need to model this mathematically.

Let me consider the internal tangent case first. The torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere's surface is tangent to the torus along a circle. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3.

I think the key is to find the points where the sphere and torus are tangent. The sphere's equation is x² + y² + z² = 11². The torus can be represented parametrically, but maybe it's easier to write the implicit equation.

The equation of a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is given by:

√(x² + y²) = R ± √( (R ± √(x² + y²))² + z² - r² )

Wait, no, that seems complicated. Alternatively, the standard equation is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z^2 = r².

So, in our case, R = 6 and r = 3. So the torus equation is (√(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9.

When the torus is inside the sphere, their surfaces are tangent. So, we can find the condition where the distance from the origin to a point on the torus is equal to 11, but since they are tangent along a circle, it's a specific set of points where both equations are satisfied and their normals are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the torus as a surface of revolution and find the points where it intersects the sphere.

Alternatively, maybe if I think in terms of cross-sections. If I take a cross-section in the plane of the torus's axis of revolution, which is the x-axis, say, then the cross-section of the torus is two circles of radius 3, centered at (6, 0) and (-6, 0). But since the torus is symmetric, I can focus on the right side where the center is at (6, 0).

The cross-section of the sphere in this plane is a circle of radius 11 centered at the origin. So, in this cross-section, the torus's cross-section is a circle of radius 3 centered at (6, 0), and the sphere's cross-section is a circle of radius 11 centered at (0,0).

I need to find where these two circles are tangent. So, in 2D, the circle from the torus is at (6,0) with radius 3, and the sphere's circle is at (0,0) with radius 11. When they are tangent internally, the distance between centers is equal to the difference of radii. Wait, but in 3D, how does this translate?

Wait
