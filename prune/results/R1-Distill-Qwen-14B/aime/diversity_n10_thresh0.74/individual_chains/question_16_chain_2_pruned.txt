Okay, I need to solve this math problem where I have to find the least prime number p such that p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Then, I also need to find the smallest positive integer m for which m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

First, I should understand what the problem is asking. It's about primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1. So, for some n, when I compute n⁴ + 1, it should be a multiple of p². My task is to find the smallest such prime p, and then find the smallest m that satisfies this condition for that p.

I remember that primes where -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p might be relevant here. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². So, first, I need to find primes p where -1 is a fourth power modulo p². But wait, I think it's more accurate to say that for p to satisfy this, there must exist an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². 

I also recall that for primes p, certain conditions must hold for -1 to be a quadratic residue. But here it's a fourth power, so maybe similar conditions but more restrictive.

Let me think about the primes where -1 is a quadratic residue. For that, p ≡ 1 mod 4. But since we're dealing with fourth powers, perhaps a higher congruence condition is needed.

Wait, for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² to have a solution, n must satisfy n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². That suggests that the order of n modulo p² divides 8. So, the multiplicative order of n modulo p² is a factor of 8. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at primes where the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. If such a solution exists, perhaps it can be lifted to a solution modulo p²? I remember Hensel's lemma, which allows lifting solutions from modulo p to higher powers under certain conditions.

So, let's first find primes p for which x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Then, check if that solution can be lifted to modulo p². If it can, then p² divides n
