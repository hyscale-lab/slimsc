Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

Let ABC be a triangle inscribed in circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given that AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Finally, we have to find m + n.

Alright, let me start by drawing a rough sketch of the problem based on the Asymptote code provided. So, triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and line AD meets the circle again at point P. We need to find AP.

First, let's note down the given lengths: AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. It might help to compute some properties of triangle ABC, like its angles or the radius of the circumcircle ω.

Since we know all three sides, perhaps we can compute the circumradius. The formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle.

To find Δ, we can use Heron's formula. Let me compute the semi-perimeter first.

s = (AB + BC + AC)/2 = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, Δ = √[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = √[12*(12 - 5)*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)] = √[12*7*3*2] = √(504).

Simplify √504: 504 factors into 16 * 31.5, wait, no, wait. 504 ÷ 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Let me factor 504 properly.

504 = 7 * 72 = 7 * 8 * 9 = 7 * 8 * 3^2.

So √504 = √(7 * 8 * 9) = √(7 * 72) = √(7 * 36 * 2) = 6√14. Wait, wait, let me verify:

Wait, 504 divided by 36 is 14, yes! Because 36 * 14 = 504. So, √504 = √(36 * 14) = 6√14. So area Δ is 6√14.

Now compute R: R = (AB * BC * AC)/(4 * Δ) = (5 * 9 * 10)/(4 * 6√14).

Compute numerator: 5*9=45, 45*10=450.

Denominator: 4*6=24, so 24√14.

Thus, R = 450 / (24√14) = (450 / 24) / √14.

Simplify 450/24: divide numerator and denominator by 6: 75/4.

So R = (75/4) / √14 = 75/(4√14). We can rationalize the denominator: 75√14 / (4*14) = 75√14 / 56.

So R = (75√14)/56. Hmm, okay.

So the circumradius is 75√14 /56.

But I'm not sure if I need the exact value of R right now. Let me think about the problem again.

We have point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, in circle geometry, the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole. Alternatively, D is the exsimilicenter of the two points B and C.

Wait, but actually, in this case, D is the external homothety center of the two tangents. But maybe more accurately, since the tangents from D touch the circle at B and C, D is the external point from which two tangents are drawn to the circle ω, touching at B and C.

So, in such a case, we can recall that DB = DC, since tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So DB = DC.

Moreover, the line AD intersects ω again at P. So, AP is the length from A to P, where P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle.

So, perhaps we can use power of a point or some similar triangle properties here.

Let me recall that the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 = DC^2, since DB and DC are tangents.

Also, the power of point D can be expressed as DB^2 = DA * DP, because AD is a secant line passing through the circle at A and P, so by the power of a point theorem, DB^2 = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then compute AP as AD - DP or something.

Wait, let's denote DA as x, and DP as
