Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find this distance, which is given in a specific form, and then compute m + n + p where the distance is m√n / p with the usual conditions on m, n, p.

Hmm, first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from this incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

I also recall that the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute the volume V and the total surface area S.

But wait, how easy is it to compute the volume of a tetrahedron with these edge lengths? The edges are given in pairs: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, maybe called an isosceles tetrahedron? I think in such cases, the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box, making it easier to compute the volume.

Let me think. If the tetrahedron is such that opposite edges are equal, it can be embedded in a box with edge lengths a, b, c such that each pair of opposite edges corresponds to the space diagonals of the box. For example, AB and CD would be the space diagonals, AC and BD as well, and BC and AD as space diagonals as well.

So, if AB = sqrt(41), which is sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Similarly, AC = sqrt(80) is sqrt(a² + b² + c²) but wait, no, that can't be right because all space diagonals would have the same length, but in this case, AB, AC, and BC are different lengths. Hmm, perhaps I got the correspondence wrong.

Wait, perhaps each pair of opposite edges are equal, not all being space diagonals of the same box. Maybe each pair corresponds to different face diagonals or something else. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system such that the coordinates of the vertices can be determined, making it easier to compute the volume and surface area.

Let me try that approach. Let's assign coordinates to the vertices. Let’s place point A at (0, 0, 0). Then, I need to assign coordinates to points B, C, D such that the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Wait, but this might be a bit involved. Let me see if there's another approach. I remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a disphenoid, and such tetrahedrons have some nice properties. For example, all four faces are congruent triangles, but wait, is that true?

Wait, no, in a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, and the faces are congruent in pairs. So, maybe in this case, the faces are congruent in pairs. Let me check: the edges are AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. So, each pair of opposite edges is equal, which is the definition of a disphenoid.

In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a
