Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have to find the square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q.

Hmm, let me think. So first, I need to understand the problem. We have a set of rectangular boxes (so, boxes with length, width, and height, all positive real numbers). Each box has a surface area of 54, and a volume of 23. The question is about the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. So, for each box, the sphere must enclose it, and we need the sphere with the minimal radius such that no matter what box from set B we take, it's contained within this sphere. Then, we're to find r squared, express it as a reduced fraction, and add the numerator and denominator.

I think the key here is that the sphere's radius will be related to the box's space diagonal. Because the sphere needs to contain the entire box, the diameter of the sphere must be at least the length of the box's space diagonal. Therefore, the radius must be at least half of the space diagonal.

So, the space diagonal of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r must satisfy r >= (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, to find the minimal r that works for all boxes in B, we need to find the maximum value of (1/2)*sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all boxes in B, since r has to accommodate the largest possible space diagonal.

Therefore, we need to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given the constraints on surface area and volume.

But perhaps instead of maximizing sqrt(x² + y² + z²), it's equivalent to maximize x² + y² + z² since the square root is a monotonically increasing function.

Yes, so the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

So, let's write down the constraints:

Surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54.

Volume: xyz = 23.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

So, how can I approach this? I think using Lagrange multipliers might be a good method here because we're optimizing a function subject to constraints.

Let me set up the function to maximize: f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z².

Constraints:
g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0,
h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, using Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the system of equations where the gradient of f is equal to λ times the gradient of g plus μ times the gradient of h.

So, computing the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z),
∇g = (2(y + z), 2(x + z), 2(x + y)),
∇h = (yz, xz, xy).

So, the equations are:

2x = λ * 2(y + z) + μ * yz,
2y = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz,
2z = λ * 2(x + y) + μ * xy.

Hmm, that's three equations. Plus the two constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54,
xyz = 23.

So, five equations with five variables (x, y, z, λ, μ). But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can find a way to simplify it.

Let me consider the possibility that x = y = z. But wait, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if a cube satisfies the surface area and volume constraints.

If x = y = z, then surface area is 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x = 3. Volume would be 27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube is not in set B. Therefore, the maximum occurs at some non-cube box.

Hmm, that suggests that the maximum x² + y² + z² occurs when the box isn't a cube. So, perhaps it's more elongated in some direction.

Alternatively, maybe two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let me assume that x = y ≠ z. Maybe that symmetry can help.

So, let me set x = y. Then, our constraints become:

Surface area: 2(x² + 2xz) = 54 → x² + 2xz = 27.

Volume: x² z = 23.

We can write z = 23/(x²).

Substituting into surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27,
x² + (46/x) = 27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x,
x³ -27x +46 =0.

Hmm, let me try to solve this equation. Let's see if there are any rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 =20 ≠0.

x=2:8 -54 +46= 0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (x -2) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x-2):

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46.

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient: 0+2=2.

Multiply by 2:4. Add to next coefficient: -27 +4= -23.

Multiply by 2: -46. Add to last coefficient:46-46=0. So, no remainder.

Thus, cubic factors as (x-2)(x² + 2x -23).

Set equal to zero:

(x-2)(x² + 2x -23)=0.

Solutions are x=2, and x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

But x must be positive, so x=2 or x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible x values are 2 and -1 +2√6.

So, for x=2:

z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, x=y=2, z=5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z²= 2² +2² + (23/4)^2=4+4+ (529/16)= 8 + 33.0625=41.0625= 657/16.

Wait, 8 is 128/16, plus 529/16 is 657/16.

But wait, let me check: 2² +2² + (23/4)^2 = 4 +4 + (529/16) = 8 + 529/16.

8 is 128/16, so 128/16 +529/16= 657/16. So, 657/16= 41.0625.

Alternatively, for x=-1 +2√6 ≈3.898.

Compute x= -1 +2√6.

Then, x²= ( -1 +2√6 )²=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6≈25-9.798≈15.202.

z=23/(x²)≈23/(15.202)=≈1.513.

So, x² + y² + z²= 2x² + z²≈2*(25 -4√6) + (1.513)^2.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, x=-1 +2√6, so x²= (2√6 -1)^2= (2√6)^2 - 2*(2√6)*1 +1²=24 -4√6 +1=25 -4√6.

So, x²=25 -4√6.

Therefore, z=23/(25 -4√6).

Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ]=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625-96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

529 is 23², so simplifies to (25 +4√6)/23.

So, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Now, compute x² + y² + z² =2x² + z².

x²=25 -4√6,
so 2x²=50 -8√6.

z²= (25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, total x² + y² + z²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me compute that.

Express 50 -8√6 as (50*529 -8√6*529)/529.

Compute numerator:

50*529= 50*(500 +29)=50*500 +50*29=25000 +1450=26450.

-8√6*529= -4232√6.

So, numerator=26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6= (26450 +721) + (-4232√6 +200√6)= 27171 -4032√6.

Therefore, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hmm, now let me compute the numerical value to compare with the previous case where x=2.

In the x=2 case, x² + y² + z²=657/16≈41.0625.

In the other case, x≈-1+2√6≈3.898, so x≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Compute x²≈3.898²≈15.19, z²≈2.29. So, 2x²≈30.38, so total≈30.38 +2.29≈32.67. But wait, that's conflicting with the earlier calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, in the case where x=2, x² + y² + z² is 4 +4 + (23/4)^2=8 + (529/16)= (128 +529)/16=657/16≈41.06.

In the other case, x is about 3.898, so x²≈15.19. So, 2x²≈30.38, z is about 1.513, so z²≈2.29. So, 30.38 +2.29≈32.67, which is less than 41.06. So, that case actually gives a smaller value.

But wait, we are trying to maximize x² + y² + z², so the case when x=2 gives a larger value than when x=-1+2√6.

Therefore, the maximum occurs at x=2, y=2, z=23/4.

Wait, but why does the other solution give a lower value? Because when we assumed x=y, the solution x=2 gives a higher x² + y² + z².

So, perhaps the maximum occurs when x=y=2, z=23/4.

But wait, maybe I should check whether the assumption x=y is valid, or whether allowing x, y, z to be different could give a higher value.

Because sometimes, when you impose symmetry in optimization, you might not get the global maximum.

So, perhaps, to confirm, I need to consider whether the maximum could be higher without assuming x=y.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers with the assumption that x, y, z are all different.

Hmm, but that might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of substituting variables.

Given that the surface area is fixed and the volume is fixed, perhaps express the problem in terms of variables that can be more easily optimized.

Alternatively, perhaps using inequalities. Since we know that for positive numbers, certain inequalities relate sums and products.

Wait, maybe using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering that for fixed surface area and volume, the shape that maximizes the space diagonal might be a cube, but in our case, the cube gives a larger volume than 23, so it's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, as we did earlier. So, maybe the case when x=y gives the maximum. Since when x=2, the x² + y² + z² is 657/16 which is around 41.06.

But let me see whether that's the maximum or if another configuration gives a higher value.

Wait, perhaps if I let one variable approach zero, making the box very elongated in another direction, but the volume is fixed at 23, so if one variable approaches zero, another must go to infinity, but the surface area is fixed at 54, so that can't happen. Because surface area includes terms with products of variables, so if one variable is very small, the others can't be too large.

Wait, let me consider the limits. Suppose z approaches zero, then x and y would have to approach infinity to maintain the volume at 23. But surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz). If z approaches zero, the dominant term is 2xy. So, 2xy approaches 54, so xy approaches 27. But volume is xyz=23, so as z approaches zero, (x*y) approaches 27, so z approaches 23/(x*y) approaches 23/27, which is about 0.85. So, z can't go to zero. Similarly, if I try to make one variable very large, the others can't be too small because of the surface area constraint.

So, perhaps the maximum of x² + y² + z² is achieved when two variables are equal, as we considered earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps not, but since in our test case, the other solution gave a lower value, maybe 657/16 is the maximum.

Wait, let's see. Let me check another case. Suppose x=1, y= something, z= something. Let's compute whether x² + y² + z² could be larger.

But perhaps it's better to proceed with the Lagrange multipliers approach.

So, going back to the Lagrange multiplier equations:

2x = λ * 2(y + z) + μ * yz, (1)

2y = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz, (2)

2z = λ * 2(x + y) + μ * xy. (3)

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

2y - 2x = λ*2[(x + z) - (y + z)] + μ*(xz - yz).

Simplify:

2(y -x) = λ*2(x + z - y - z) + μ*z(x - y).

Simplify further:

2(y -x) = λ*2(x - y) + μ*z(x - y).

Factor (x - y):

2(y -x) = (x - y)[ -2λ + μ z ]

So,

2(y -x) = (x - y)[-2λ + μ z ]

Note that (x - y) = -(y -x), so:

2(y -x) = (-1)(y -x)[-2λ + μ z ]

So,

2(y -x) = (y -x)[-2λ + μ z ]

Assuming y ≠ x, we can divide both sides by (y -x):

2 = -2λ + μ z,

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

2z - 2y = λ*2[(x + y) - (x + z)] + μ*(xy - xz).

Simplify:

2(z - y) = λ*2(y - z) + μ*x(y - z).

Factor (y - z):

2(z - y) = 2λ(y - z) + μ x (y - z).

Again, factor (y - z):

2(z - y) = (y - z)(-2λ + μ x )

So,

2(z - y) = (y - z)(-2λ + μ x )

Note that (z - y) = -(y - z), so:

-2(y - z) = (y - z)(-2λ + μ x )

If y ≠ z, we can divide both sides by (y - z):

-2 = -2λ + μ x

So,

-2 = -2λ + μ x

Similarly, we have from earlier:

From equation (1)-(2): 2 = -2λ + μ z   (Equation A)

From equation (3)-(2): -2 = -2λ + μ x   (Equation B)

So, Equations A and B are:

2 = -2λ + μ z,

-2 = -2λ + μ x.

Subtracting Equation B from Equation A:

2 - (-2) = (-2λ + μ z) - (-2λ + μ x )

4 = μ(z - x )

So,

4 = μ(z - x )

Similarly, we can consider equations (1)-(3):

Wait, maybe it's better to consider Equations A and B.

From Equation A: 2 = -2λ + μ z,

From Equation B: -2 = -2λ + μ x.

Subtract Equation B from Equation A:

4 = μ(z - x ).

So, 4 = μ(z - x ) → μ = 4/(z - x )

Similarly, from equation (1) and (2), we found that if y ≠ x, then 2 = -2λ + μ z,

and from equation (3) and (2), -2 = -2λ + μ x.

So, let me write these as:

Equation 1: 2 = -2λ + μ z,

Equation 3: -2 = -2λ + μ x.

Subtracting Equation 3 from Equation 1:

4 = μ(z - x )

So, we have μ = 4/(z -x )

Similarly, from Equations (1) and (2), we can write:

From Equation (1): 2x = 2λ(y + z) + μ y z,

From Equation (2): 2y = 2λ(x + z) + μ x z.

Let me subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):

2x - 2y = 2λ(y + z - x - z ) + μ(y z - x z )

Simplify:

2(x - y) = 2λ(y -x ) + μ z (y - x )

Factor (x - y):

2(x - y) = -2λ(x - y) + μ z (x - y )

Assuming x ≠ y, divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = -2λ + μ z

Which is consistent with Equation A.

Similarly, from the other equations, I think we can proceed.

But this is getting a bit involved. Maybe I can express λ and μ in terms of x, y, z.

From Equation A: 2 = -2λ + μ z,

From Equation B: -2 = -2λ + μ x.

Subtract Equation B from Equation A:

4 = μ(z - x )

So, μ = 4/(z - x )

Similarly, from Equation (1): 2x = 2λ(y + z ) + μ y z.

Express λ from Equation A: 2 = -2λ + μ z → 2λ = μ z - 2 → λ = (μ z - 2)/2.

Substitute into Equation (1):

2x = 2 * [(μ z - 2)/2 ] * (y + z ) + μ y z.

Simplify:

2x = (μ z - 2)(y + z ) + μ y z.

Expand:

2x = μ z (y + z ) - 2(y + z ) + μ y z.

Combine terms:

2x = μ z y + μ z² - 2y - 2z + μ y z.

Combine like terms:

2x = 2μ z y + μ z² - 2y - 2z.

Wait, let's see:

Wait, it's μ z y + μ z² + μ y z.

Wait, no, the first term is μ z(y + z )= μ z y + μ z².

Then, plus μ y z, so total μ z y + μ z² + μ y z = 2 μ z y + μ z².

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, equation (1) after substitution:

2x = (μ z - 2)(y + z ) + μ y z.

Expanding (μ z - 2)(y + z )= μ z y + μ z² - 2y - 2z.

Then, adding μ y z: So, 2x = μ z y + μ z² - 2y - 2z + μ y z.

So, 2x = 2 μ z y + μ z² - 2y - 2z.

Rearranging:

2x + 2y + 2z = 2 μ z y + μ z².

Factor left side: 2(x + y + z ) = μ z (2 y + z )

But from the surface area equation, 2(xy + yz + xz )=54 → xy + yz +xz=27.

Hmm, perhaps. Also, volume is xyz=23.

Wait, let me see. Let me denote S = x + y + z,

P = xy + yz + xz =27,

V=xyz=23.

So, the equation becomes:

2S = μ z (2y + z )

But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe express 2y + z in terms of other variables.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe instead, we can assume that x = y, as before, and see if that satisfies the Lagrange conditions.

Earlier, we found that when x=y=2, z=23/4, we get a certain x² + y² + z². Let's check if this satisfies the Lagrange multiplier conditions.

So, let's set x=y=2, z=23/4.

Compute gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z )= (4, 4, 2*(23/4))= (4,4, 23/2 ).

∇g = 2(x+y, x+z, y+z )= 2(2+23/4, 2+23/4, 2+23/4 ). Wait, let's compute each component:

First component: 2(y + z )=2(2 +23/4)=2*( (8 +23)/4 )=2*(31/4)=31/2.

Second component: 2(x + z )= same as first, 31/2.

Third component:2(x + y )=2*(2+2)=8.

∇h= (yz, xz, xy)= (2*(23/4), 2*(23/4), 2*2 )=(23/2, 23/2,4).

Now, according to Lagrange conditions:

∇f = λ ∇g + μ ∇h.

So,

(4,4,23/2 )= λ*(31/2, 31/2, 8 ) + μ*(23/2,23/2,4).

So, let me write the equations:

For x-component: 4 = λ*(31/2) + μ*(23/2 ) → 4 = (31 λ +23 μ )/2 → 8=31 λ +23 μ.

For y-component: 4 = λ*(31/2) + μ*(23/2 ) → same as x-component.

For z-component:23/2 = λ*8 + μ*4.

So, we have two equations:

1) 31 λ +23 μ =8,

2) 8 λ +4 μ =23/2.

Let me write equation 2 as 8λ +4μ = 23/2.

Multiply equation 1 by 4: 124 λ +92 μ =32.

Multiply equation 2 by 23: 184 λ +92 μ = (23)(23/2)=529/2.

Wait, no, equation 2 multiplied by 23 would be:

Wait, equation 2 is 8λ +4μ =23/2.

Multiply by 23: 184λ +92μ= (23)(23/2)=529/2.

Wait, equation 1 multiplied by 4 is 124λ +92μ=32.

Subtract equation 1*4 from equation 2*23:

(184λ +92μ) - (124λ +92μ )=529/2 -32.

So,

60λ =529/2 -32.

Compute 529/2 -32:32 is 64/2, so 529/2 -64/2=465/2.

Thus, 60λ=465/2 → λ= (465/2)/60=465/(120)=31/8.

So, λ=31/8.

Now, substitute back into equation 1:31*(31/8) +23 μ=8.

Compute 31*(31/8)=961/8.

So,

961/8 +23 μ=8 →23 μ=8 -961/8=64/8 -961/8= (64 -961)/8= (-897)/8 → μ= (-897)/(8*23 )= (-897)/184.

Simplify: 897 ÷23=39, because 23*39=897.

So, μ= -39/184/1= -39/184.

Wait, simplifying:

897 ÷23=39, so 897=23*39.

Therefore, μ= (-23*39)/(8*23 )= -39/8.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 23 μ= (-897)/8 → μ= (-897)/(8*23 )= (-39)/8.

Because 897=23*39, so it's 23*39/(8*23 )=39/8.

But with a negative sign, so μ= -39/8.

Wait, let me compute:

23 μ= (-897)/8 → μ= (-897)/(8*23 )= (-39)/8.

Yes, correct.

So, λ=31/8, μ= -39/8.

So, these values satisfy the Lagrange conditions, meaning that the point x=y=2, z=23/4 is a critical point.

Therefore, this is a candidate for maximum or minimum.

Given that in the other case when x=-1+2√6, the value of x² + y² + z² was lower, and that we have found a critical point at x=y=2, z=23/4 with a higher value, it's likely that this is the maximum.

Therefore, the maximum x² + y² + z² is 657/16, so the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4.

Thus, the radius r of the sphere is half of the space diagonal, so r= sqrt(657)/8. Therefore, r²=657/(8²)=657/64.

Wait, but let me confirm: space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²)=sqrt(657/16 ). So, the radius is half of that, which is sqrt(657)/8. Therefore, r squared is (657)/(64).

But I need to check if 657 and 64 are coprime.

657 ÷3=219, 64 ÷3≠integer.

So, 657=3*219=3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. So, no common factors. Therefore, 657 and 64 are coprime.

Wait, 73 is a prime number. So, yes, 657 and 64 are coprime.

Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but let me confirm that in this case, the sphere with radius sqrt(657)/8 indeed contains all boxes in B.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at another point where x ≠ y, but given that the critical point we found gives a higher value than the case when x=y=-1+2√6, which gave a lower value, I think it's the maximum.

So, I think the answer is 721.


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set \( \mathcal{B} \), where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The value of \( r^2 \) is expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime positive integers, and we are to find \( p + q \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Objective**: Maximize the space diagonal \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \) of the box, as the radius \( r \) of the smallest enclosing sphere is half of this diagonal.

2. **Constraints**:
   - Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \) ⟹ \( xy + yz + xz = 27 \).
   - Volume: \( xyz = 23 \).

3. **Assumption of Symmetry**: Assume \( x = y \) to simplify the problem. This leads to:
   - Surface area: \( x^2 + 2xz = 27 \).
   - Volume: \( x^2 z = 23 \).

4. **Solving for \( z \)**:
   - From the volume constraint: \( z = \frac{23}{x^2} \).
   - Substitute into the surface area equation: \( x^2 + 2x \cdot \frac{23}{x^2} = 27 \) ⟹ \( x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0 \).

5. **Roots of the Cubic Equation**:
   - Testing rational roots, we find \( x = 2 \) is a root.
   - Factoring gives \( (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x - 23) = 0 \), yielding solutions \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -1 \pm 2\sqrt{6} \).

6. **Evaluating the Solutions**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( z = \frac{23}{4} \).
   - Compute \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16} \).

7. **Verification**:
   - The other solution \( x = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \) results in a smaller value for \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \).
   - Thus, the maximum occurs at \( x = y = 2 \), \( z = \frac{23}{4} \).

8. **Space Diagonal and Radius**:
   - Space diagonal: \( \sqrt{\frac{657}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{657}}{4} \).
   - Radius \( r = \frac{\sqrt{657}}{8} \), so \( r^2 = \frac{657}{64} \).

9. **Simplification**:
   - \( 657 \) and \( 64 \) are coprime, so \( p = 657 \), \( q = 64 \), giving \( p + q = 721 \).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{721}
