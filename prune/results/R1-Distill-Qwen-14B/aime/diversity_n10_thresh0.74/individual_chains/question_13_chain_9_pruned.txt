Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, they're asking me to find the number of minutes the walk takes her when she walks at s + ½ kilometers per hour, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that the time she spends walking changes with her speed, but the time she spends in the coffee shop, t minutes, remains the same in both scenarios. So, we have two different speeds and two different total times, each including t minutes. I need to find t and s first, I think, before I can figure out the time when her speed is s + ½.

Let me break this down. I'll start by writing equations based on the information given.

First scenario: speed = s km/h, time taken = 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the actual walking time is (4 hours minus t minutes). But wait, t is in minutes, and the walking time is in hours. I should convert everything to the same units to avoid confusion. Let me convert t minutes to hours because the speed is in km per hour.

So, t minutes is t/60 hours. Therefore, the walking time for the first scenario is 4 hours minus t/60 hours. Let me write that as:

Walking time (first case) = 4 - (t/60) hours.

But wait, the walking time is also equal to the distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km, and the speed is s km/h. So,

Walking time (first case) = 9 / s hours.

So, equating the two expressions:

9 / s = 4 - (t/60).

Similarly, for the second scenario: her speed is s + 2 km/h, and the total time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that total time into hours as well. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So, 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours. So, the total time is 2.4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, similar to before, the walking time is 2.4 hours minus t/60 hours.

Walking time (second case) = 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

Again, the walking time is equal to distance divided by speed. So,

Walking time (second case) = 9 / (s + 2) hours.

So, equating the two expressions:

9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60).

Now, I have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can solve these two equations to find s and t.

Let me write them down again for clarity:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Hmm, so if I can subtract these equations or manipulate them to eliminate t, I can find s first, and then find t.

Let me rearrange both equations to express t in terms of s.

From Equation 1:

9/s = 4 - (t/60)
=> t/60 = 4 - (9/s)
=> t = 60*(4 - 9/s)
=> t = 240 - 540/s.

From Equation 2:

9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)
=> t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)
=> t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s + 2))
=> t = 144 - 540/(s + 2).

Now, both expressions equal t, so I can set them equal to each other:

240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s + 2)

Let me write that:

240 - (540/s) = 144 - (540/(s + 2))

Subtracting 144 from both sides:

240 - 144 - (540/s) = -540/(s + 2)

Which simplifies to:

96 - (540/s) = -540/(s + 2)

Hmm, let's rearrange this:

96 = (540/s) - (540/(s + 2))

Let me factor out 540:

96 = 540 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)]

Simplify the expression in the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = (s + 2 - s) / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So,

96 = 540 * [2 / (s(s + 2))]

Simplify the right side:

540 * 2 = 1080, so:

96 = 1080 / [s(s + 2)]

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

96 * s(s + 2) = 1080

Let me compute 96 * s(s + 2) = 1080.

Divide both sides by 96:

s(s + 2) = 1080 / 96

Let me compute 1080 divided by 96.

Hmm, 96 * 11 = 1056, which is less than 1080 by 24. So, 1080 = 96 * 11 + 24.

24 is 96 * (24/96) = 0.25.

So, 1080 / 96 = 11 + 0.25 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25.

Let me write that as a quadratic equation:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Hmm, let's solve for s.

Using the quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25.

So,

s = [ -2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) ) ] / 2*1
= [ -2 ± sqrt(4 + 45) ] / 2
= [ -2 ± sqrt(49) ] / 2
= [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

So, two possible solutions:

1) [ -2 + 7 ] / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5
2) [ -2 - 7 ] / 2 = (-9)/2 = -4.5

But since speed can't be negative, we discard the -4.5.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now that I have s, I can find t.

From earlier, t = 240 - 540/s.

Plugging s = 2.5 into this:

t = 240 - (540 / 2.5)

Compute 540 / 2.5. Let me think: 2.5 goes into 540 how many times?

Well, 2.5 * 200 = 500, so 540 - 500 = 40.

2.5 goes into 40 16 times because 2.5 * 16 = 40.

So, 540 / 2.5 = 216.

So, t = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes.

Great, so t is 24 minutes.

Now, the problem asks: Suppose Aya walks at s + ½ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, her new speed is s + ½ = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time, including the coffee shop time, which is t = 24 minutes.

So, first, find the walking time at 3 km/h.

Walking time = distance / speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

But wait, that's only the walking time. The total time includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

So, the total time is 3 hours plus 24 minutes. I need to express this in minutes to match the units.

3 hours is 180 minutes, so 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me double-check.

Wait, her speed
