Alright, so I've got this math problem about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop stop. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, let's read the problem again and note down the important details.

Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops at a coffee shop. There are two scenarios given:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' km/h, the total time taken is 4 hours. This includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at 's + 2' km/h, the total time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

We need to find the total time she takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

Okay, so the key here is to find the values of 's' and 't' first, and then compute the time when her speed is 's + 1/2' km/h.

Let's break down each scenario.

**First Scenario:**
- Speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- This total time includes walking time plus coffee shop time (t minutes).

So, the time she spends walking is total time minus t minutes. Let's denote the walking time as T1.

T1 = 240 - t minutes.

But wait, we can also express the walking time in terms of speed and distance. The formula for time is distance divided by speed.

Walking time (T1) in hours = Distance / Speed = 9 / s hours.

But wait, we need to convert this into minutes because our total time is in minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, T1 in minutes is (9 / s) * 60.

So, (9 / s) * 60 = 240 - t.

Let me write that as equation (1):

(9 * 60) / s = 240 - t → 540 / s = 240 - t.

**Second Scenario:**
- Speed = s + 2 km/h
- Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let's convert that to minutes for consistency. 2 hours is 120 minutes, so 120 + 24 = 144 minutes.
- Again, total time includes walking time plus coffee shop time (t minutes).

So, walking time T2 = 144 - t minutes.

Using the same approach as before, T2 in hours is 9 / (s + 2). Converting to minutes: (9 / (s + 2)) * 60.

So, (9 * 60) / (s + 2) = 144 - t → 540 / (s + 2) = 144 - t.

Let me write this as equation (2):

540 / (s + 2) = 144 - t.

Now, we have two
