Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1.

Wait, but the expression I'm dealing with isn't directly related to Φ₁₃(x), but maybe I can manipulate it to use properties of cyclotomic polynomials or something similar.

Let me look at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern.

Hmm, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}... Let me see if this can be rewritten. Let me denote z = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z². So, that's z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, can this quadratic be factored or related to some known polynomial?

I know that z² - 2z + 2 has roots which can be found using the quadratic formula. The roots would be [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, z² - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So, substituting back z = ω^k, we get (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, each term in the product can be expressed as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Which can be separated into two products: the product of (ω^k - (1 + i)) times the product of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, if I let P = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) and Q = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)), then the original product is P * Q.

Now, I need to compute P and Q. Hmm, how can I compute such products?

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x¹³ - 1. But here, instead of x, we're plugging in (1 + i) and (1 - i). So, maybe P is the value of the polynomial evaluated at (1 + i), but wait, not exactly.

Wait, no. The product_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - ω^k) = x^n - 1, right? So in this case, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹³ - 1.

But in our case, x is (1 + i) or (1 - i). So, P = product_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, Q = (1 - i)^13 - 1.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me think.

Yes, because product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹
