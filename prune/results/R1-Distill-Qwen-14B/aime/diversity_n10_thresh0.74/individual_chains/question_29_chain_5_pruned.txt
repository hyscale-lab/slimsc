Okay, so I've got this geometry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means all four of these points lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. So, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line DC, points E and F must lie somewhere on this line. That probably means that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C or something? Wait, not necessarily. I need to figure out the order.

Also, A, D, H, G are on a circle. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. That might be useful because cyclic quadrilaterals have certain properties, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees, or the power of a point theorem. Hmm.

Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Coordinates might help me calculate distances and use the cyclic quadrilateral condition.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0) because CD = 107. Point B is at (0,16), and point A is at (0,16) because AB = 107? Wait, no, AB is 107. Wait, no, AB is the side from A to B, which in a rectangle is the vertical side. Wait, hold on, maybe I mixed up the sides.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, BC is the next. So, if AB = 107, and BC = 16, then AB is the length, and BC is the width. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (0,16), right? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in a rectangle, moving from A to B to C to D, the sides AB and BC are adjacent. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should define the rectangle more carefully. Let's think of ABCD with points labeled in order, so AB is from A to B, BC from B to C, CD from C to D, DA from D back to A. So, in a rectangle, AB is
