Okay, so I have this math problem about residents in Aimeville and what they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on set theory, but I'll give it a shot.

First, let me list out all the information I have:

- Total residents: 900.
- Number of residents owning a diamond ring: 195.
- Number owning a set of golf clubs: 367.
- Number owning a garden spade: 562.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's 900 people owning candy hearts.
  
Wait, so candy hearts are owned by all. That might make things a bit easier because it's a universal set here.

Next, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four. Hmm, okay.

I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That's used to calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on.

But wait, in this problem, we're given numbers about exactly two and exactly three. So maybe I can model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Let me denote the four items as follows:

- Let R be the set of residents owning a diamond ring.
- G for golf clubs.
- S for spade.
- C for candy hearts, which is everyone, so C = 9
