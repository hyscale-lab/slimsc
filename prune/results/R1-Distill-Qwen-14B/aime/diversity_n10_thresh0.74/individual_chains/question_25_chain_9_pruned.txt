Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. There are 900 residents in total. Let me list out the given information to get a clear picture.

First, the numbers of people owning each item:
- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spade owners: 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.

Additionally, there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these items, and 234 who own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items.

Hmm, this seems like a classic inclusion-exclusion problem. I remember that for four sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle can get a bit complicated, but maybe I can manage it step by step.

Let me denote the four sets as:
- D: Diamond ring owners
- G: Golf clubs owners
- S: Garden spade owners
- C: Candy hearts owners (which is everyone, so C has 900 elements)

Wait, but candy hearts are something everyone owns. So, when considering overlaps, owning candy hearts is a given. So, perhaps I can think of the problem in terms of the other three items, knowing that everyone has a candy heart.

But wait, the problem says that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, C is the universal set here, right? That means every person is in set C. So, when we talk about people owning other items, it's within the context of C.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of people who own all four items, which is the same as owning all three items (D, G, S) because C is mandatory.

Wait, but let me clarify. If someone owns all four, it's D∩G∩S∩C. But since C is everyone, that's the same as D∩G∩S. So, the number of people who own all four is equal to the number of people who own all three: D, G, and S.

Hmm, so maybe the key is to find |D ∩ G ∩ S|, which is the same as the number of people owning all four.

Let me think about how inclusion-exclusion works for three sets, and then maybe relate it to four.

Wait, but in this case, since C is universal,
