Okay, so I have this problem here: there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to unpack it.

First, I remember that a rhombus has two diagonals that intersect at their midpoints. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is (0,0), that must be the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the origin is the midpoint of AC and BD. That means if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), right? Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q). So, all four points are (x, y), (-x, -y), (p, q), (-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on. But maybe it's easier to use the properties of the rhombus in terms of vectors or slopes. Alternatively, I can think about the diagonals being perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Wait, another thought: Points A and C are reflections over the origin, as are B and D. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Or wait, no, that's a square. In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular, but they aren't necessarily equal in length.

So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, are perpendicular, and bisect each other. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.

Let me try to represent the points in terms of vectors. Let’s say point A is (a, b), so point C is (-a, -b). Similarly, point B is (c, d), so point D is (-c, -d). So, the diagonals are AC, which is from (a, b) to (-a, -b), and BD, from (c, d) to (-c, -d). The vectors for these diagonals would be (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d). 

Wait, but the diagonals themselves are the lines connecting these points. So, the vector for diagonal AC is from A to C, which is (-2a, -2b), and for BD, it's (-2c, -2d). For the rhombus, these diagonals must be perpendicular. So, their dot product must be zero.

So, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0. Simplifying, that's 4ac + 4bd = 0. Dividing both sides by 4, we get ac + bd = 0. So, that's a condition that must be satisfied by points A and
