Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These are in the first quadrant, right? Then there's a family F of segments PQ, each of unit length (so length 1), lying in the first quadrant. Each of these segments has point P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each PQ in F, P is somewhere on the x-axis, Q is somewhere on the y-axis, and the distance between them is 1.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, which is not A or B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Because A is on the x-axis and B is on the y-axis, so AB is a segment of length 1 in F.

So, C is a point on AB, but it's not A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers. Then, find p + q.

Alright, let me try to visualize this. First, plot the points O, A, and B. So O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up on the y-axis, since sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So segment AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). That should form a triangle with O? Wait, OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2, and AB is of length sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] which is sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So triangle OAB is a triangle with sides 1/2, sqrt(3)/2, and 1. That's a 30-60-90 triangle, right?

Because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : sqrt(3) : 2. But here, the sides are 1/2, sqrt(3)/2, 1, which is exactly half of that. So yes, triangle OAB is a 30-60-90 triangle with the right angle at O, angle at A is 60 degrees, and angle at B is 30 degrees.

Now, the family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a line segment of length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, lying in the first quadrant. So each PQ is a line from some point (p, 0) to (0, q), such that the distance between them is 1. So the equation of PQ is (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, right? Because it's a line intercepting x-axis at p and y-axis at q.

But the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1. So each PQ is a line segment with intercepts (p,0) and (0,q) where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1. So the family F consists of all such segments where p and q are positive real numbers.

Now, the problem is about point C on AB, which is not A or B, such that it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, the point C is unique in the sense that it's the only such point on AB that isn't covered by any other PQ in F except AB itself.

So, I need to find such a point C, then compute OC^2.

Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, parametrize segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the parametric equation for AB can be written as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So any point C on AB can be represented as ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, the point C must not lie on any other PQ in F except AB. So, suppose there exists another PQ in F that passes through C. Then, we need to find t such that C is only on AB and no other PQ.

Alternatively, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, the point C is such that there are no p and q with p^2 + q^2 = 1, p ≠ 1/2, q ≠ sqrt(3)/2, such that C lies on the line PQ.

Wait, but AB is part of F, so C is on AB, which is in F. So, we need that for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, perhaps the point C is the point on AB that is closest to the origin? Or maybe it's the point where the tangent from C to some circle condition is satisfied?

Alternatively, maybe it's the point where the envelope of all these PQ lines touches AB.

Wait, the envelope of the family F of lines might form a curve, and the point C is the point where this envelope is tangent to AB? Hmm, that might be a way to approach it.

Let me think about the envelope of the family of lines. Each line in F is given by x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1, p > 0, q > 0.

So, we can parametrize p and q in terms of an angle. Let me set p = cos θ and q = sin θ, since p^2 + q^2 = 1. Then, the equation of the line becomes x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1.

Alternatively, we can write this as x sec θ + y csc θ = 1.

The envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system of equations given by the original equation and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.

So, let's write F(θ) = x sec θ + y csc θ - 1 = 0.

Compute the derivative of F with respect to θ:

dF/dθ = -x sec θ tan θ - y csc θ cot θ = 0.

So, the envelope is found by solving:

1. x sec θ + y csc θ = 1,
2. -x sec θ tan θ - y csc θ cot θ = 0.

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1.

Equation 2: -x (sin θ / cos^2 θ) - y (cos θ / sin^2 θ) = 0.

So, equation 2 can be rewritten as:

- x sin θ / cos^2 θ - y cos θ / sin^2 θ = 0

Multiply both sides by cos^2 θ sin^2 θ to eliminate denominators:

- x sin^3 θ - y cos^3 θ = 0

So, equation 2 becomes:

x sin^3 θ + y cos^3 θ = 0.

Hmm, but from equation 1, x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1, which can be written as x = cos θ (1 - y / sin θ).

Substitute x into equation 2:

cos θ (1 - y / sin θ) * sin^3 θ + y cos^3 θ = 0.

Let me compute each term:

First term: cos θ * (1 - y / sin θ) * sin^3 θ
= cos θ * sin^3 θ * (1 - y / sin θ)
= cos θ sin^3 θ - y cos θ sin^2 θ.

Second term: y cos^3 θ.

So, equation 2 becomes:

[cos θ sin^3 θ - y cos θ sin^2 θ] + y cos^3 θ = 0

Simplify:

cos θ sin^3 θ - y cos θ sin^2 θ + y cos^3 θ = 0

Let me factor terms with y:

cos θ sin^3 θ + y( - cos θ sin^2 θ + cos^3 θ ) = 0

Factor out cos θ:

cos θ sin^3 θ + y cos θ ( - sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ ) = 0

Divide both sides by cos θ (assuming cos θ ≠ 0, which it isn't since p = cos θ is positive in first quadrant):

sin^3 θ + y ( - sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ ) = 0

So,

y (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ) = - sin^3 θ

Thus,

y = (- sin^3 θ) / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

Similarly, from equation 1:

x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1

We can express x in terms of y and θ:

x = cos θ (1 - y / sin θ )

So substituting the expression for y:

x = cos θ [ 1 - ( (- sin^3 θ ) / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) ) / sin θ ]

Simplify:

x = cos θ [ 1 + ( sin^2 θ ) / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) ]

Let me compute the term inside the brackets:

1 + [ sin^2 θ / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) ]

= [ (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) + sin^2 θ ] / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

= [ cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ + sin^2 θ ] / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

= cos^2 θ / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

So,

x = cos θ * [ cos^2 θ / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) ]

= cos^3 θ / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

Similarly, y was expressed as:

y = (- sin^3 θ ) / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

So, now, we have parametric equations for the envelope:

x = cos^3 θ / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

y = - sin^3 θ / (cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify this.

Note that cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ = cos(2θ). So, let's write:

x = cos^3 θ / cos(2θ )

y = - sin^3 θ / cos(2θ )

So, x = (cos^3 θ ) / cos(2θ )

Similarly, y = ( - sin^3 θ ) / cos(2θ )

Let me see if I can express x and y in terms of multiple angles or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write these as:

x = cos θ * (cos^2 θ) / cos(2θ )

But cos^2 θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2, so:

x = cos θ * (1 + cos 2θ)/2 / cos 2θ

= cos θ [ (1 + cos 2θ ) / (2 cos 2θ ) ]

= cos θ [ (1/(2 cos 2θ )) + (cos 2θ )/(2 cos 2θ ) ]

= cos θ [ 1/(2 cos 2θ ) + 1/2 ]

= (cos θ )/(2 cos 2θ ) + cos θ / 2

Similarly, y = - sin^3 θ / cos(2θ )

Hmm, perhaps I can write sin^3 θ as sin θ (1 - cos^2 θ ), but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of sin 2θ or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can express these parametric equations in terms of t = tan θ or something else.

Let me consider t = tan θ. Then, sin θ = t / sqrt(1 + t^2 ), cos θ = 1 / sqrt(1 + t^2 ).

But that might complicate things more.

Alternatively, let's think about the parametric equations:

x = cos^3 θ / cos(2θ )

y = - sin^3 θ / cos(2θ )

Let me compute x and y in terms of cos θ and sin θ.

Wait, perhaps I can write x = cos^3 θ / cos 2θ.

Express cos 2θ as 2 cos^2 θ - 1.

So, x = cos^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ - 1 )

Similarly, y = - sin^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ - 1 )

Hmm, that seems more manageable.

Let me denote u = cos θ.

So, cos θ = u, so sin θ = sqrt(1 - u^2 ), since θ is in the first quadrant.

So, substituting:

x = u^3 / (2u^2 - 1 )

y = - ( (1 - u^2 )^(3/2) ) / (2u^2 - 1 )

Hmm, but this might not be too helpful yet.

Alternatively, maybe we can eliminate θ from the parametric equations.

Given x and y in terms of θ, let's try to express y in terms of x.

We have:

x = cos^3 θ / (cos 2θ )

y = - sin^3 θ / (cos 2θ )

Let me denote cos 2θ = c, so:

x = cos^3 θ / c

y = - sin^3 θ / c

We can write these as:

cos^3 θ = c x

sin^3 θ = -c y

But since c = cos 2θ = 2 cos^2 θ - 1, which is 2u^2 - 1 in my earlier substitution.

Wait, perhaps I can relate x and y by taking the ratio.

From x and y:

x / y = [ cos^3 θ / c ] / [ - sin^3 θ / c ] = - (cos θ / sin θ )^3 = - (cot θ )^3

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, let me think about the parametric equations:

x = cos^3 θ / cos 2θ

Let me write cos 2θ as 2 cos^2 θ - 1.

So, x = cos^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ - 1 )

Similarly, y = - sin^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ - 1 )

Let me write u = cos θ. Then, 2 cos^2 θ - 1 = 2u^2 -1.

So,

x = u^3 / (2u^2 -1 )

y = - (1 - u^2 )^(3/2 ) / (2u^2 -1 )

Hm, this seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can express y in terms of x.

Let me solve for u in terms of x:

From x = u^3 / (2u^2 - 1 )

Let me write:

x (2u^2 -1 ) = u^3

So,

2x u^2 - x = u^3

Bring all terms to one side:

u^3 - 2x u^2 + x = 0

This is a cubic equation in u. Maybe I can express y in terms of u and then substitute.

Wait, y = - (1 - u^2 )^(3/2 ) / (2u^2 -1 )

But 2u^2 -1 is in the denominator, and from x's equation, we have:

x(2u^2 -1 ) = u^3 → 2u^2 -1 = u^3 / x

So, 2u^2 -1 = u^3 / x → Thus, (1 - u^2 ) = 1 - u^2.

Wait, perhaps I can write (1 - u^2 ) in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, let me note that 2u^2 -1 = (u^3 ) / x.

So, 2u^2 -1 = u^3 / x → 2u^2 = u^3 / x +1 → 2u^2 = (u^3 + x ) / x → Multiply both sides by x:

2x u^2 = u^3 + x → Rearranged as u^3 - 2x u^2 + x = 0, which is the same as before.

Hmm, I might be going in circles here.

Wait, maybe instead of trying to eliminate θ, I can think about the envelope as a curve that's tangent to each PQ in F. So, the envelope is a curve that touches each PQ at exactly one point.

Given that AB is a member of F, the envelope should be tangent to AB at point C. So, point C is the point where the envelope is tangent to AB.

Wait, that might be the case. So, since AB is part of F, the envelope must be tangent to AB at C.

So, perhaps the point C is the point where the envelope touches AB, making AB the tangent line to the envelope at C.

So, perhaps I can find the point C on AB where the envelope touches AB, which would be the unique point not lying on any other PQ in F except AB.

So, to find this point, I can find the point where the envelope is tangent to AB.

So, let me find the equation of AB, then find the condition for the envelope to be tangent to AB at point C.

Equation of AB: since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/2 ) / (-1/2 ) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 * (x intercept is 1/2, so when x=1/2, y=0). Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Point A is (1/2, 0), and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2 ). So, the slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/2 ) / (-1/2 ) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + b. To find b, plug in A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b → b = sqrt(3)/2.

Thus, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, the envelope's equation should be tangent to this line at point C.

But earlier, I had the parametric equations for the envelope. Let me think if I can find the equation of the envelope.

Wait, the envelope is given by the parametric equations:

x = cos^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ -1 )

y = - sin^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ -1 )

But I need an equation in x and y. Alternatively, since the envelope is tangent to AB at C, perhaps I can find the point C by ensuring that the envelope and AB meet at C and the derivatives at C are equal.

So, let me find the derivative of the envelope at point C and set it equal to the derivative of AB at C.

Firstly, compute dy/dx for AB.

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2, so dy/dx = -sqrt(3).

Now, compute dy/dx for the envelope. Since the envelope is given parametrically in terms of θ, the derivative is (dy/dθ ) / (dx/dθ ).

From the parametric equations:

x = cos^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ -1 )

y = - sin^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ -1 )

Compute dx/dθ and dy/dθ.

First, compute dx/dθ:

Let me denote denominator as D = 2 cos^2 θ -1.

So, x = cos^3 θ / D.

Compute dx/dθ:

Using quotient rule: (3 cos^2 θ (-sin θ ) * D - cos^3 θ * dD/dθ ) / D^2

Compute dD/dθ:

dD/dθ = 2 * 2 cos θ (-sin θ ) = -4 cos θ sin θ.

Wait, no. D = 2 cos^2 θ -1, so dD/dθ = 2 * 2 cos θ (-sin θ ) = -4 cos θ sin θ? Wait, 2 cos^2 θ derivative is 4 cos θ (-sin θ ). Wait, no.

Wait, derivative of cos^2 θ is 2 cos θ (-sin θ ) = -2 cos θ sin θ.

So, derivative of D = 2 cos^2 θ -1 is 2*(-2 cos θ sin θ ) = -4 cos θ sin θ.

Wait, no. Wait, D = 2 cos^2 θ -1

dD/dθ = 2*(2 cos θ (-sin θ )) ? Wait, no. Wait, chain rule. Let me properly compute:

dD/dθ = 2 * d/dθ (cos^2 θ ) - 0 = 2*(2 cos θ (-sin θ )) = -4 cos θ sin θ.

Yes, that's right.

So, back to dx/dθ:

dx/dθ = [ 3 cos^2 θ (-sin θ ) * D - cos^3 θ * (-4 cos θ sin θ ) ] / D^2

Simplify numerator:

First term: 3 cos^2 θ (-sin θ ) * D = -3 cos^2 θ sin θ D

Second term: - cos^3 θ * (-4 cos θ sin θ ) = +4 cos^4 θ sin θ

So, numerator:

-3 cos^2 θ sin θ D + 4 cos^4 θ sin θ

Factor out cos^2 θ sin θ:

cos^2 θ sin θ ( -3 D + 4 cos^2 θ )

Similarly, D = 2 cos^2 θ -1, so:

-3 D +4 cos^2 θ = -3 (2 cos^2 θ -1 ) +4 cos^2 θ = (-6 cos^2 θ +3) +4 cos^2 θ = (-2 cos^2 θ +3 )

So, numerator becomes:

cos^2 θ sin θ ( -2 cos^2 θ +3 )

Thus,

dx/dθ = [ cos^2 θ sin θ (3 - 2 cos^2 θ ) ] / D^2

Similarly, compute dy/dθ.

y = - sin^3 θ / D.

So, dy/dθ:

= [ 3 sin^2 θ cos θ * D - (- sin^3 θ ) * dD/dθ ] / D^2

= [ 3 sin^2 θ cos θ D + sin^3 θ *4 cos θ sin θ ] / D^2

Simplify numerator:

First term: 3 sin^2 θ cos θ D

Second term: 4 sin^4 θ cos θ

Factor out sin^2 θ cos θ:

sin^2 θ cos θ (3 D +4 sin^2 θ )

Again, D = 2 cos^2 θ -1.

So,

3 D +4 sin^2 θ = 3 (2 cos^2 θ -1 ) +4 sin^2 θ = 6 cos^2 θ -3 +4 sin^2 θ

But 6 cos^2 θ +4 sin^2 θ -3.

Hmm, can we express this in terms of cos 2θ? Well, cos^2 θ = (1 + cos 2θ )/2, sin^2 θ = (1 - cos 2θ )/2.

So,

6 cos^2 θ = 6*(1 + cos 2θ )/2 = 3 (1 + cos 2θ )

4 sin^2 θ =4*(1 - cos 2θ )/2= 2 (1 - cos 2θ )

So,

6 cos^2 θ +4 sin^2 θ = 3 (1 + cos 2θ ) + 2 (1 - cos 2θ ) = 3 + 3 cos 2θ + 2 - 2 cos 2θ = 5 + cos 2θ.

So,

3 D +4 sin^2 θ = (5 + cos 2θ ) - 3 = 2 + cos 2θ.

Wait, no. Wait, sorry, that was:

3 D +4 sin^2 θ = 6 cos^2 θ -3 +4 sin^2 θ = (6 cos^2 θ +4 sin^2 θ ) -3.

Which is 3 (1 + cos 2θ ) + 2 (1 - cos 2θ ) -3.

Wait, that's 3 + 3 cos 2θ + 2 -2 cos 2θ -3 = (3+2-3) + (3 cos 2θ -2 cos 2θ )= 2 + cos 2θ.

So, 3 D +4 sin^2 θ = 2 + cos 2θ.

Thus, numerator for dy/dθ is sin^2 θ cos θ (2 + cos 2θ )

So, dy/dθ = [ sin^2 θ cos θ (2 + cos 2θ ) ] / D^2

Thus, the derivative dy/dx for the envelope is (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ ) = [ sin^2 θ cos θ (2 + cos 2θ ) / D^2 ] / [ cos^2 θ sin θ (3 - 2 cos^2 θ ) / D^2 ]

Simplify:

sin^2 θ cos θ (2 + cos 2θ ) / [ cos^2 θ sin θ (3 - 2 cos^2 θ ) ]

= [ sin θ (2 + cos 2θ ) ] / [ cos θ (3 - 2 cos^2 θ ) ]

So, dy/dx = [ sin θ (2 + cos 2θ ) ] / [ cos θ (3 - 2 cos^2 θ ) ]

But we also know that the envelope is tangent to AB at point C, so dy/dx must equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

So,

[ sin θ (2 + cos 2θ ) ] / [ cos θ (3 - 2 cos^2 θ ) ] = -sqrt(3 )

Hmm, that's a trigonometric equation in θ. Let's try to solve this.

First, let me rewrite 2 + cos 2θ and 3 - 2 cos^2 θ.

We know that cos 2θ = 2 cos^2 θ -1, so 2 + cos 2θ = 2 + 2 cos^2 θ -1 = 1 + 2 cos^2 θ.

Similarly, 3 - 2 cos^2 θ is as it is.

So, substituting:

[ sin θ (1 + 2 cos^2 θ ) ] / [ cos θ (3 - 2 cos^2 θ ) ] = -sqrt(3 )

Let me denote u = cos θ.

Then, sin θ = sqrt(1 - u^2 ), since θ is in the first quadrant.

So,

[ sqrt(1 - u^2 ) (1 + 2u^2 ) ] / [ u (3 - 2u^2 ) ] = -sqrt(3 )

But wait, the left-hand side is positive because all terms are positive (since u is positive as cos θ is positive in first quadrant), but the RHS is negative. That can't be. Hmm, that suggests a mistake.

Wait, in the derivative, I had:

dy/dx = [ sin θ (2 + cos 2θ ) ] / [ cos θ (3 - 2 cos^2 θ ) ]

But earlier, when I substituted, I had:

2 + cos 2θ = 1 + 2 cos^2 θ

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, 2 + cos 2θ:

cos 2θ = 2 cos^2 θ -1 → 2 + cos 2θ = 2 + 2 cos^2 θ -1 = 1 + 2 cos^2 θ. Yes, that's correct.

So, the LHS is positive, because numerator and denominator are positive.

But the RHS is negative. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing dy/dθ or dx/dθ.

Wait, let's go back to the parametric equations.

x = cos^3 θ / D, where D = 2 cos^2 θ -1.

y = - sin^3 θ / D.

So, when θ is in the first quadrant, D = 2 cos^2 θ -1.

For 0 < θ < π/2, cos θ decreases from 1 to 0.

So, when θ is less than π/4, cos θ > sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707, so 2 cos^2 θ > 0.5 → 2 cos^2 θ -1 > -0.5. Wait, but for θ < arccos(1/sqrt(2)) = π/4, cos θ > 1/sqrt(2), so 2 cos^2 θ > 1 → D = 2 cos^2 θ -1 > 0.

For θ > π/4, 2 cos^2 θ <1 → D <0.

So, for θ < π/4, D is positive, so x is positive because cos^3 θ is positive.

Similarly, y is negative because of the negative sign: y = - sin^3 θ / D.

Wait, but in the first quadrant, y should be positive because all points in F are in the first quadrant. Wait, no, the envelope can go into other quadrants, but the segments PQ are in the first quadrant. Wait, but the envelope is the set of points where the family of lines is tangent, so perhaps it's a convex curve in the first quadrant.

Wait, but for θ > π/4, D becomes negative. So, x = cos^3 θ / D would be negative, which would put x in negative side, but we are only considering the first quadrant. So, perhaps the relevant θ is between 0 and π/4, where D is positive.

So, perhaps θ is between 0 and π/4, so D is positive, so x is positive, y is negative? But that can't be because the segments are in the first quadrant.

Wait, no, the envelope is the set of points where the PQ lines are tangent, which can be in other quadrants, but the segments themselves are in the first quadrant.

But in our problem, we are concerned with point C on AB in the first quadrant. So, perhaps the envelope crosses the first quadrant as well.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

When θ is between 0 and π/4, D is positive, so x is positive, y is negative (since sin θ is positive, and D is positive, so y is negative). That would place the envelope in the fourth quadrant for θ < π/4.

But we need the envelope in the first quadrant. So maybe θ is between π/4 and π/2. In that case, D is negative, so x is negative (since cos^3 θ is positive, D negative → x negative ), and y is positive (since sin^3 θ is positive, D negative → y negative? Wait, y is - sin^3 θ / D. D is negative, so y = - sin^3 θ / D = positive, because sin^3 θ positive, D negative, so negative over negative is positive.

So, for θ > π/4, D negative, x negative, y positive.

But in the first quadrant, x and y are positive, so perhaps the envelope in the first quadrant is only for θ > π/4, but then x is negative. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The segments PQ are in the first quadrant, so the envelope is the boundary of the region covered by these segments. So, the envelope should be a convex curve starting from (1,0) to (0,1), forming a sort of parabola in the first quadrant.

Wait, perhaps I made a sign mistake in the parametric equations. Let me re-examine.

The envelope equations were:

x = cos^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ -1 )

y = - sin^3 θ / (2 cos^2 θ -1 )

But when θ is in (0, π/4 ), D = 2 cos^2 θ -1 is positive, so x is positive, y is negative.

When θ is in (π/4, π/2 ), D is negative, so x is negative, y is positive.

But in the first quadrant, both x and y should be positive. So, perhaps the envelope in the first quadrant is only for θ between π/4 and π/2, but then x is negative, which is not in the first quadrant. Hmm, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to flip the sign in the parametric equations for y. Because when D is negative, the denominator is negative, and y is negative as well because of the negative sign. So y is positive when D is negative. Because:

y = - sin^3 θ / D.

If D is negative, then y is positive.

Wait, for θ in (π/4, π/2 ), D is negative, so x = cos^3 θ / D is negative, since cos^3 θ is positive and D is negative. So x is negative, which is in the second quadrant.

So, the envelope crosses into the second quadrant for θ > π/4.

But our AB segment is in the first quadrant, so perhaps the point C is where the envelope in the second quadrant meets AB in the first quadrant. Hmm, that might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing the envelope.

Wait, let me go back to the equations.

We had:

Equation 1: x sec θ + y csc θ = 1.

Equation 2: -x sec θ tan θ - y csc θ cot θ = 0.

Wait, when I solved equation 2 earlier, I had:

- x sin^3 θ - y cos^3 θ = 0.

But let me double-check that step.

From equation 2:

- x (sin θ / cos^2 θ ) - y (cos θ / sin^2 θ ) = 0.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, F(θ) = x sec θ + y csc θ -1 =0.

dF/dθ = -x sec θ tan θ - y csc θ cot θ =0.

So, equation 2 is:

- x sec θ tan θ - y csc θ cot θ = 0.

So, let me write:

- x (sin θ / cos^2 θ ) - y (cos θ / sin^2 θ ) = 0.

So, equation 2 is:

- x (sin θ / cos^2 θ ) - y (cos θ / sin^2 θ ) = 0.

Multiply both sides by cos^2 θ sin^2 θ:

- x sin^3 θ - y cos^3 θ = 0.

So, equation 2 is:

x sin^3 θ + y cos^3 θ = 0.

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. I think I missed a negative sign earlier.

So, equation 2 is x sin^3 θ + y cos^3 θ =0.

So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier steps.

So, correct equations are:

1. x sec θ + y csc θ =1 → x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1.

2. x sin^3 θ + y cos^3 θ =0.

So, that's different.

So, equation 2 is x sin^3 θ + y cos^3 θ =0.

So, now, let's solve these two equations.

From equation 1:

x = cos θ (1 - y / sin θ )

Substitute into equation 2:

cos θ (1 - y / sin θ ) sin^3 θ + y cos^3 θ =0.

Compute each term:

First term: cos θ (1 - y / sin θ ) sin^3 θ = cos θ sin^3 θ - y cos θ sin^2 θ.

Second term: y cos^3 θ.

So, equation 2 becomes:

cos θ sin^3 θ - y cos θ sin^2 θ + y cos^3 θ =0.

Factor terms:

cos θ sin^3 θ + y ( - cos θ sin^2 θ + cos^3 θ )=0.

Factor cos θ:

cos θ [ sin^3 θ + y ( - sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ ) ] =0.

Since cos θ ≠0 (as θ is in first quadrant), we have:

sin^3 θ + y ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) =0.

So,

y ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) = - sin^3 θ.

Thus,

y = - sin^3 θ / ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

Similarly, from equation 1:

x = cos θ (1 - y / sin θ )

Substitute y:

x = cos θ [1 - ( - sin^3 θ / ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) ) / sin θ ]

Simplify:

x = cos θ [1 + sin^2 θ / ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) ]

= cos θ [ ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ + sin^2 θ ) / ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) ]

= cos θ [ cos^2 θ / ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ ) ]

= cos^3 θ / ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

So, same as before, but y now is negative when denominator is positive, and positive when denominator is negative.

Wait, so the parametric equations are:

x = cos^3 θ / ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

y = - sin^3 θ / ( cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ )

Alternatively, using double-angle identities:

cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ = cos 2θ.

So,

x = cos^3 θ / cos 2θ

y = - sin^3 θ / cos 2θ

So, same as before, but y is negative when cos 2θ is positive (θ < π/4 ), and positive when cos 2θ is negative (θ > π/4 ).

So, for θ in (0, π/4 ), cos 2θ positive, so x positive, y negative.

For θ in (π/4, π/2 ), cos 2θ negative, so x negative, y positive.

So, in the first quadrant, the envelope only exists when y is positive, but x is negative, which is in the second quadrant. So, perhaps the envelope in the first quadrant is only the part with θ < π/4, but then y is negative, which is in the fourth quadrant.

Wait, that can't be, because the segments PQ are in the first quadrant, so their envelope should be in the first quadrant as well.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, let's re-examine the problem. The family of lines is x / p + y / q =1, with p^2 + q^2 =1, p>0, q>0.

Each line lies in the first quadrant, so the envelope must be in the first quadrant.

But according to the parametric equations, the envelope is in the fourth and second quadrants.

Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the envelope calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered F(θ) = x sec θ + y csc θ -1, but with p = cos θ, q = sin θ, but only for θ where p and q are positive and p^2 + q^2 =1.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered θ going from -π/2 to π/2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a different parameterization, such as t = tan θ, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the envelope as the parabola x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, which is the astroid.

Wait, let me recall that the envelope of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2 =1 is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Yes, that's a known result. So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, the astroid is the curve that is tangent to each PQ in F.

So, the astroid equation is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, point C is the point where the astroid is tangent to AB.

So, to find point C, we can solve the system:

1. y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

2. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

And also, the derivative of the astroid at point C must equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

So, let's compute derivative of astroid.

Differentiating implicitly:

(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.

So,

dy/dx = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - (y^(1/3) ) / (x^(1/3) )

So, dy/dx = - (y/x )^(1/3 )

But the slope must equal -sqrt(3 ), so:

- (y/x )^(1/3 ) = -sqrt(3 )

Simplify:

(y/x )^(1/3 ) = sqrt(3 )

Cube both sides:

y/x = (sqrt(3 ))^3 = 3 sqrt(3 )

So,

y = 3 sqrt(3 ) x.

But, from the equation of AB, y = -sqrt(3 ) x + sqrt(3 ) / 2.

So, set 3 sqrt(3 ) x = -sqrt(3 ) x + sqrt(3 ) / 2.

Bring terms with x to one side:

3 sqrt(3 ) x + sqrt(3 ) x = sqrt(3 ) / 2.

Factor sqrt(3 ) x:

sqrt(3 ) x (3 +1 ) = sqrt(3 ) / 2.

So,

4 sqrt(3 ) x = sqrt(3 ) / 2.

Divide both sides by sqrt(3 ):

4x = 1/2 → x = 1/8.

Then, y = 3 sqrt(3 ) * (1/8 )= 3 sqrt(3 ) /8.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3 ) /8 ).

But wait, is this point on AB?

Yes, because substituting x=1/8 into AB's equation:

y = -sqrt(3 )*(1/8 ) + sqrt(3 )/2 = (-sqrt(3 )/8 ) + (4 sqrt(3 )/8 )= 3 sqrt(3 )/8. So yes, correct.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3 ) /8 ).

Now, check if this point is on any other segment PQ from F besides AB.

Wait, the problem states that C is the unique point on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB.

Since the astroid is the envelope, and AB is tangent to the astroid at C, which is inside the first quadrant, so C is the point where the astroid is closest to the origin, perhaps.

Wait, let me compute OC^2.

OC^2 is (1/8 )^2 + (3 sqrt(3 ) /8 )^2 = 1/64 + (27 ) /64 = 28 /64 =7 /16.

Wait, 27 +1 =28, yes.

So, OC^2 =7/16, so p=7, q=16, which are coprime.

So, p+q=23.

Wait, but wait, when I computed the envelope, I thought it was the astroid, but I need to confirm if C is indeed on AB and is the only point not lying on other PQs.

Wait, but according to the problem, C is the unique point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, if C is on AB and is the point of tangency of the envelope (astroid) with AB, then it's the only point on AB not lying on any other PQ.

So, this should be the correct answer.

Thus, OC^2=7/16, and p+q=7+16=23.


To solve the problem, we first recognize that the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ forms an envelope known as an astroid. The astroid's equation is given by $x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1$. The segment $\overline{AB}$ is tangent to this astroid at a unique point $C$.

1. **Equation of Line AB**: The line $\overline{AB}$ has endpoints $A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$ and $B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$. Its equation is derived as $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

2. **Condition for Tangency**: The point $C$ lies on both the astroid and the line $\overline{AB}$. Additionally, the slopes of the astroid and $\overline{AB}$ at $C$ must be equal. The derivative of the astroid is found to be $dy/dx = -\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^{1/3}$. Setting this equal to the slope of $\overline{AB}$, which is $-\sqrt{3}$, yields the condition $\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^{1/3} = \sqrt{3}$, leading to $y = 3\sqrt{3}x$.

3. **Solving for $C$**: Substituting $y = 3\sqrt{3}x$ into the equation of $\overline{AB}$ gives $x = \frac{1}{8}$ and $y = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$. Thus, $C$ is at $\left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)$.

4. **Calculating $OC^2$**: The distance from the origin to $C$ is squared as:
   \[
   OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
   \]
   Therefore, $p = 7$ and $q = 16$, and $p + q = 23$.

The final answer is $\boxed{23}$.
