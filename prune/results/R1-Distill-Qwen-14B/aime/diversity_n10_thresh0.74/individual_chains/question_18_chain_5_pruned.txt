Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, right? So, it's a 12-sided polygon, regular, so all sides and angles are equal.

First, I think I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 vertices, each equally spaced around a circle. So, each vertex is 30 degrees apart because 360 divided by 12 is 30. That might be useful.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. In a regular polygon, a rectangle would be formed by four vertices such that the opposite sides are equal and the angles are 90 degrees. But wait, in a regular dodecagon, not all angles are 90 degrees—most are 150 degrees, since the internal angle of a regular n-gon is (n-2)*180/n. For n=12, that's (10/12)*180=150 degrees. So, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned in such a way that their sides are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, but how can four points form a rectangle? I think I need to think about the properties of rectangles in a regular polygon. In a regular polygon, for a set of four points to form a rectangle, the opposite sides must be parallel and equal in length, and the diagonals must be equal and bisect each other. But in a regular dodecagon, there are certain diagonals that can serve as sides or as the longer sides of a rectangle.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the coordinates of the vertices. If I place the dodecagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin, each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. For a regular dodecagon, θ would be 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., up to 330°.

So, if I can find four points among these 12 such that they form a rectangle. For a rectangle, the midpoints of the diagonals must coincide, and the distance between each pair of adjacent vertices must satisfy the rectangle's properties.
