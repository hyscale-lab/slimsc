Okay, so I've got this problem here: 

There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember some logarithm rules, so maybe I can simplify these equations.

First, let's recall that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. Also, log properties let me bring exponents in front. So log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a). 

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, but log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x. Let me denote that as log_x(y) = a, so then a = log_x(y), which implies that x^a = y. 

So substituting back, the first equation becomes x * a = 10. Since a = log_x(y), which is the same as ln(y)/ln(x), but maybe I can express a in terms of x and y later.

But let's do the same for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let me denote log_y(x) as b, so b = log_y(x), which implies y^b = x. 

So the second equation becomes 4y * b = 10. Now, I have two equations:

1. x * a = 10
2. 4y * b = 10

But I also know that a and b are related because a = log_x(y) and b = log_y(x). I think these are reciprocals of each other. Let me check: since a = log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x), and b = log_y(x) = ln(x)/ln(y). So indeed, a = 1/b.

So, a = 1/b. Therefore, from the first equation, x*(1/b) = 10, which means x = 10b. From the second equation, 4y*b = 10, so y = 10/(4b) = (5)/(2b).

Now, I can express x and y in terms of b. So x = 10b and y = 5/(2b). Also, since a = 1/b, and a = log_x(y), which I can write as log_{10b}(5/(2b)) = 1/b.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can use the relationship between x and y through the equations.

Alternatively, I might consider that since x = 10b and y = 5/(2b), I can express both in terms of b and then find a relationship.

Let me write down x = 10b and y = (5)/(2b). Now, I can substitute these into the expression for a, which is log_x(y) = a. Since a = 1/b, let's see.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since I have expressions for x and y in terms of b, I can plug them into the equation a = log_x(y). So, a = log_x(y) = log_{10b}(5/(2b)).

But since a = 1/b, this becomes:

1/b = log_{10b}(5/(2b)).

Hmm, this might be tricky, but maybe I can use the change of base formula. So log_{10b}(5/(2b)) = ln(5/(2b)) / ln(10b).

So, 1/b = [ln(5/(2b))]/[ln(10b)].

This gives me an equation in terms of b. Let me write it out:

1/b = [ln(5/(2b))]/[ln(10b)].

I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator:

ln(10b) = b * ln(5/(2b)).

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: ln(10b) = ln(10) + ln(b).

Right side: b * [ln(5) - ln(2b)] = b * [ln(5) - (ln(2) + ln(b))] = b*(ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(b)).

So putting it together:

ln(10) + ln(b) = b*(ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(b)).

Let me denote ln(b) as t to simplify. So let t = ln(b), which implies that b = e^t. 

Substituting
