Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. They can be written as ω^k where k ranges from 0 to 12, and ω = e^(2πi/13). Since ω ≠ 1, we're considering the primitive roots.

The expression I need to compute is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote this product as P. So,

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I need to find P mod 1000.

Hmm, products over roots of unity often relate to cyclotomic polynomials or result in integer values when expanded. Maybe I can find a clever way to express this product more simply.

Looking at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor or rewrite this expression.

Let's write it as:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2

Hmm, maybe factor it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me treat ω^k as a variable, say x. Then the expression becomes x² - 2x + 2.

So, the term is x² - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k.

Is this a cyclotomic polynomial? Let me recall that cyclotomic polynomials are factors of x^n - 1 and are minimal polynomials over the integers for primitive roots of unity.

Wait, but x² - 2x + 2 is a quadratic. Let me check if it's irreducible over the integers. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so it doesn't factor into linear terms with integer coefficients. So, it's irreducible over the integers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to another cyclotomic polynomial. The cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) for n= something. Let's see, Φ_3(x) = x² + x + 1. No, that's different.

Wait, maybe I can write x² - 2x + 2 as something else. Let me complete the square.

x² - 2x + 2 = (x - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, that's (x-1)^2 + 1, which factors as (x - 1 + i)(x - 1 - i). But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe think of it in terms of roots. The roots of x² - 2x + 2 = 0 are x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i.

So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Wait, but how does this help me with the product over k=0 to 12?

Maybe I can think of the product as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points. Let me consider that the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x^13 - 1, since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. But in our case, the terms are more complicated.

Wait, each term in the product is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), which is similar to evaluating a quadratic at ω^k. So perhaps I can write this as a product over the roots of some polynomial.

Alternatively, think of the product as evaluating the polynomial Q(x) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2x + x^2) at x = ω^k, and then take the product over all k. But that seems a bit abstract.

Wait, no, actually, the product is over each k, so each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) which is the same as (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me denote y_k = ω^k. Then each term is y_k² - 2y_k + 2.

So, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (y_k² - 2y_k + 2) where y_k are the 13th roots of unity.

Alternatively, since y_k are all the 13th roots of unity, perhaps the product can be written as ∏_{y^13=1} (y² - 2y + 2).

Which is equal to ∏_{y^13=1} (y² - 2y + 2). Hmm, perhaps I can compute this product by considering that it's the product over all roots y of y² - 2y + 2 evaluated at y being a 13th root of unity. So, maybe this is related to evaluating a certain resultant or via polynomial division.

Wait, let me recall that if f(x) is a polynomial, then ∏_{a} (x - a) = f(x), where a are the roots of f(x). But here, we have a product over specific transformations of the roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each root y of x^13 = 1, I have a term (y² - 2y + 2). So, the product would be the product of (y² - 2y + 2) for all y such that y^13 = 1.

But how do I compute this product? Maybe it's the same as evaluating the resultant of x^13 - 1 and y² - 2y + 2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1. Its roots are the 13th roots of unity, y_k = ω^k.

So, the product over k=0 to 12 of (y_k² - 2y_k + 2) is equal to the product over all roots y of f(x) of (y² - 2y + 2). 

I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over its roots a of (x - a) is f(x). But here, we're taking the product over roots a of (a² - 2a + 2), which is equivalent to evaluating f( something ).

Wait, perhaps it's similar to evaluating f( something ). Let me think: the product over a of (a - c) is f(c). But in our case, we have (a² - 2a + 2), which is a quadratic in a. Maybe I can write it as (a - α)(a - β), where α and β are the roots of x² - 2x + 2 = 0, which are 1 ± i as we found earlier.

So, the product over a of (a² - 2a + 2) is the same as the product over a of (a - α)(a - β) where α = 1 + i and β = 1 - i.

So, that product is equal to the product over a of (a - α)(a - β) = [product over a of (a - α)] * [product over a of (a - β)].

But each product over a of (a - α) is f(α), where f(x) = x^13 - 1. Because f(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - y_k), so f(α) = product_{k=0}^{12} (α - y_k). Similarly, f(β) = product_{k=0}^{12} (β - y_k).

So, the entire product is f(α) * f(β).

Therefore, P = f(α) * f(β) = (α^13 - 1) * (β^13 - 1).

Wait, that makes sense! Since f(x) = x^13 - 1, then f(α) is α^13 - 1 and f(β) is β^13 - 1.

So, now I need to compute (α^13 - 1)(β^13 - 1).

Hmm, let's compute α^13 and β^13 first.

But α = 1 + i. Let me compute α^13.

First, compute α squared: (1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.

Then, (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.

(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.

(1 + i)^12 = (16)( (1 + i)^4 )^3 = 16*(-4)^3 = 16*(-64) = -1024.

Wait, no, because (1 + i)^12 is ((1 + i)^4)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step:

Compute (1 + i)^1 = 1 + i.

(1 + i)^2 = 2i.

(1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)(2i) = 2i + 2i^2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i.

(1 + i)^4 = (-2 + 2i)(1 + i) = (-2)(1) + (-2)(i) + 2i(1) + 2i(i) = -2 - 2i + 2i + 2i^2 = -2 + 0i - 2 = -4.

(1 + i)^5 = (1 + i)^4*(1 + i) = (-4)(1 + i) = -4 -4i.

(1 + i)^6 = (-4 -4i)(1 + i) = (-4)(1) + (-4)(i) + (-4i)(1) + (-4i)(i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i^2 = -4 -8i +4 = 0 -8i = -8i.

(1 + i)^7 = (-8i)(1 + i) = -8i -8i^2 = -8i +8 = 8 -8i.

(1 + i)^8 = (8 -8i)(1 + i) = 8(1) +8( i) -8i(1) -8i(i) = 8 +8i -8i -8i^2 = 8 +0i +8 = 16.

(1 + i)^9 = 16*(1 + i) = 16 +16i.

(1 + i)^10 = (16 +16i)(1 +i) =16 +16i +16i +16i^2 =16 +32i -16= 32i.

(1 + i)^11 =32i*(1 +i)=32i +32i^2=32i -32= -32 +32i.

(1 + i)^12 = (-32 +32i)(1+i)= -32(1) -32i +32i(1) +32i(i)= -32 -32i +32i +32i^2= -32 +0i -32= -64.

(1 + i)^13 = (-64)(1 +i)= -64 -64i.

Similarly, β =1 -i. Let's compute β^13.

Because β is the conjugate of α, and since all exponents are integers, β^n is the conjugate of α^n.

So, (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate of (1 + i)^13.

Since (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, the conjugate is -64 +64i.

Wait, let me check that:

Compute (1 - i)^13.

Similarly, (1 - i)^2 = 1 -2i +i² = 1 -2i -1 = -2i.

(1 - i)^3 = (1 - i)^2*(1 -i)= (-2i)(1 - i)= -2i +2i^2= -2i -2= -2 -2i.

(1 - i)^4 = (-2 -2i)(1 -i)= (-2)(1) + (-2)(-i) + (-2i)(1) + (-2i)(-i)= -2 +2i -2i +2i²= -2 +0i -2= -4.

(1 -i)^5 = (-4)(1 -i)= -4 +4i.

(1 -i)^6 = (-4 +4i)(1 -i)= -4(1) +4i(1) +4i*(-i) -4i^2= -4 +4i -4i^2 +4= Hmm, wait, let me compute it step by step.

Wait, (1 -i)^5 is -4 +4i.

(1 -i)^6 = (1 -i)^5*(1 -i)= (-4 +4i)(1 -i)= -4(1) +4i(1) +4i*(-i) -4i*(-i^2).

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as:

(-4 +4i)(1 -i) = (-4)(1) + (-4)(-i) +4i(1) +4i*(-i) = -4 +4i +4i -4i² = -4 +8i +4 = 8i.

Wait, because 4i*(-i) = -4i² = -4*(-1) =4.

Wait, no, let me clarify:

(-4 +4i)(1 -i) = (-4)*1 + (-4)*(-i) +4i*1 +4i*(-i) = -4 +4i +4i -4i².

i squared is -1, so -4i² is 4.

So, -4 + (4i +4i) +4 = (-4 +4) +8i= 0 +8i=8i.

Yes, so (1 -i)^6=8i.

(1 -i)^7=8i*(1 -i)=8i -8i^2=8i +8=8 +8i.

(1 -i)^8=(8 +8i)(1 -i)=8(1) -8i +8i -8i^2=8 -8i +8i +8=16.

(1 -i)^9=16*(1 -i)=16 -16i.

(1 -i)^10=(16 -16i)(1 -i)=16 -16i -16i +16i²=16 -32i -16= -32i.

(1 -i)^11= -32i*(1 -i)= -32i +32i^2= -32i -32= -32 -32i.

(1 -i)^12= (-32 -32i)(1 -i)= -32(1) +32i -32i +32i^2= -32 +0i -32= -64.

(1 -i)^13= -64*(1 -i)= -64 +64i.

So, indeed, (1 +i)^13= -64 -64i and (1 -i)^13= -64 +64i.

So, f(α)=α^13 -1= (-64 -64i) -1= -65 -64i.

Similarly, f(β)=β^13 -1= (-64 +64i) -1= -65 +64i.

Therefore, P= f(α)*f(β)= (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).

This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (-65)^2 - (64i)^2= 4225 - (4096)(i^2)=4225 - (4096)(-1)=4225 +4096=8321.

Wait, let me compute that again:

(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.

Compute each part:

(-65)^2 = 4225.

(64i)^2=64^2 * i^2=4096*(-1)= -4096.

So, subtracting: 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096=8321.

So, P=8321.

Wait, but let me verify my calculations because 8321 seems a bit large, and I'm supposed to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000.

So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Hmm, but wait, I need to be sure that my calculation of P is correct. Let me double-check.

First, I considered that the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity y of (y² -2y +2).

Then, since y² -2y +2 factors as (y - (1+i))(y - (1-i)), the product becomes product_{y} (y - (1+i))(y - (1 -i)).

Which is equal to [product_{y} (y - (1+i))] * [product_{y} (y - (1-i))].

Each product is f(1+i) and f(1-i), where f(x) = x^13 -1, since all y are roots of x^13 -1=0.

So, f(1+i)= (1+i)^13 -1 and f(1-i)= (1 -i)^13 -1.

We computed (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i, so f(1+i)= -64 -64i -1= -65 -64i.

Similarly, f(1 -i)= -65 +64i.

Multiplying these together: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)= (-65)^2 - (64i)^2=4225 - (4096)(-1)=4225 +4096=8321.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, P=8321.

Therefore, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me confirm if my initial approach is correct. Is the product over all y of (y² -2y +2) equal to f(1+i)*f(1-i) where f(x)=x^13 -1?

Yes, because f(x)=product_{y} (x - y), so product_{y} (y - a)=f(a).

Wait, no, actually, product_{y} (y - a) = product_{y} (a - y) * (-1)^13 = (-1)^13 * product_{y} (a - y)= - product_{y} (a - y)= -f(a).

Wait, because product_{y} (y - a) = product_{y} ( -(a - y) )= (-1)^13 product_{y} (a - y)= - product_{y} (a - y)= -f(a).

Since f(a)=product_{y} (a - y). So, product_{y} (y - a)= -f(a).

So, in our case, the product is product_{y} (y - (1+i)) * product_{y} (y - (1 -i))= [ -f(1+i) ] * [ -f(1 -i) ]= (-1)^2 * f(1+i) f(1 -i)= f(1+i) f(1 -i).

So, yes, that part was correct. So, P= f(1+i)f(1 -i)=8321.

Thus, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.

Therefore, the answer should be 321.


To solve the problem, we recognize that the product involves terms of the form \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\), where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. Rewriting each term as a quadratic in \(\omega^k\), we have \( \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2 \). This can be expressed as a product over all 13th roots of unity \(y\) of the quadratic polynomial \(y^2 - 2y + 2\).

The product becomes:

\[
\prod_{y^{\,13}=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2)
\]

This product can be rewritten as:

\[
\prod_{y^{\,13}=1} (y - (1 + i))(y - (1 - i))
\]

Each factor is evaluated at the roots of unity \(y\), so the product is:

\[
\left( \prod_{y^{\,13}=1} (y - (1 + i)) \right) \left( \prod_{y^{\,13}=1} (y - (1 - i)) \right)
\]

These products are equivalent to evaluating the polynomial \(f(x) = x^{13} - 1\) at \(x = 1 + i\) and \(x = 1 - i\), giving:

\[
f(1 + i) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad f(1 - i) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1
\]

Calculating \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\) yields \(-64 - 64i\) and \(-64 + 64i\), respectively. Thus:

\[
f(1 + i) = -65 - 64i \quad \text{and} \quad f(1 - i) = -65 + 64i
\]

Multiplying these results:

\[
(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 8321
\]

Finally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{321}
\]
