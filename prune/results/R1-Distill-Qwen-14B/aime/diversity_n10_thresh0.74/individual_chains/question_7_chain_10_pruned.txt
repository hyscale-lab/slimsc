Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention that the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me first make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a regular octagon, so it has 8 sides and 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each color equally likely, so each has a probability of 1/2. Now, after all the vertices are colored, we want to know the probability that we can rotate the octagon in such a way that every blue vertex moves to a position that was initially red. 

Wait, so the octagon can be rotated, and when we do that, the blue vertices should align with the red vertices from the original configuration. So, it's like we're looking for a rotation symmetry in the coloring that swaps red and blue.

Since it's a regular octagon, it has rotational symmetries of order 8, meaning we can rotate it by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, right? So, there are 8 possible rotations. The question is about the probability that for at least one of these rotations, all blue vertices in the original coloring are mapped to red vertices.

Wait, not exactly. Because each rotation is a permutation of the vertices. So, if we have a coloring, and we rotate it by some angle, the image of each vertex under rotation must have the color opposite to its original color. So, for the coloring to satisfy the condition, there must exist a rotation such that for every vertex, its image under rotation is of the opposite color.

So, in other words, the coloring is such that there exists a rotation that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. Since the octagon is regular, the set of red and blue vertices must form rotationally symmetric configurations.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of orbits under rotation. Maybe each color configuration has some rotational symmetry, and we need the blue set to be a rotation of the red set.

Alternatively, perhaps it's useful to model the colors as a binary string of length 8, where each bit represents a vertex color: 0 for red, 1 for blue. Then, the condition is that there's a rotation of the string such that every 1 in the original string is mapped to a 0 in the rotated string, and vice versa. So, the rotated string is the complement of the original string.

Wait, that seems correct. So, if we rotate the octagon by some number of steps (each step is 45°), the resulting color configuration should be the bitwise complement of the original. So, we need to find the number of binary strings of length 8 such that some rotation of the string is equal to the complement of the original string.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of such binary strings and then dividing by the total number of possible colorings, which is 2^8 = 256.

So, how do we count the number of binary strings s of length 8 such that s rotated by k positions (for some k) equals the complement of s? That is, for some k, r^k(s) = \overline{s}, where r is the rotation by 45°, and \overline{s} is the complement of s.

Wait, so for each string s, we need to check if any of its rotations (including the identity rotation, which is 0 steps) is equal to the complement of s. So, the set of such strings s is the union over all k (0 to 7) of the set of strings where r^k(s) = \overline{s}.

But we have to be careful because some strings might satisfy this condition for multiple k's, so we have to account for overlaps to avoid overcounting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for each possible rotation k, the number of binary strings s such that r^k(s) = \overline{s} is equal to 2^{8 - gcd(8, k)}}, because the rotation by k positions partitions the string into cycles of length d = gcd(8, k), and each cycle must be all 0s or all 1s in the complement. Wait, maybe that's a stretch, but let's think.

Wait, each rotation by k steps can be seen as a permutation of the string's indices. The permutation's cycle structure is determined by the greatest common divisor of k and 8. For example, if k = 1, then the permutation is a single 8-cycle, because 1 and 8 are coprime. If k = 2, the permutation breaks into two 4-cycles, since gcd(2,8)=2. Similarly, for k=4, you get four 2-cycles, and for k=8, it's the identity, so 8 fixed points.

So, for each rotation k, the number of binary strings s such that r^k(s) = \overline{s} would be equal to 2^{number of cycles in the permutation induced by k}.

Wait, why? Because each cycle in the permutation must be consistent. For example, in a cycle of length d, the bits in the original string must be such that when rotated by k, they become the complement. So, for each cycle, the bits are linked in a way that their values must follow a certain pattern.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this. Let's consider a single cycle of length d. Let's say the original bits in the cycle are a_1, a_2, ..., a_d. After rotation by k steps (which shifts each element in the cycle), we get a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ..., a
