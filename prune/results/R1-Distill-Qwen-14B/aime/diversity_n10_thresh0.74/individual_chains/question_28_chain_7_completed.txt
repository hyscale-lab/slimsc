Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, and express it in the form m√n/p, then find m + n + p.

Hmm, first, what do I know about tetrahedrons and incenters? I recall that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces. This distance is called the inradius, similar to the inradius in a triangle. To find this inradius, I think I need the volume of the tetrahedron and the sum of the areas of its faces or something related.

Wait, in a triangle, the inradius is Area divided by semiperimeter. But for a tetrahedron, I believe the formula is Volume divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces multiplied by 1/3. Let me confirm that.

Yes, the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is r = 3V / A₁ + A₂ + A₃ + A₄, where V is the volume and A₁, A₂, A₃, A₄ are the areas of the four faces.

So, I need to find the volume V and the areas of all four faces.

But wait, the problem gives me the lengths of the edges, but they're paired as AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. This seems symmetric. Maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, but not necessarily regular. Alternatively, perhaps it's a kind of "kite" tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal.

I think I can model this tetrahedron as having two pairs of opposite edges equal, which might mean it's a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and all faces are congruent triangles. Wait, but in this case, the edges are AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. So each pair of opposite edges is equal. So it's a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, right? Wait, no, because the edge lengths are different for each pair.

Wait, AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. So each face is a triangle with edge lengths √41, √80, √89. Because each face is a triangle made by three edges: for example, face ABC has edges AB=√41, BC=√89, and AC=√80. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB=√41, AD=√89, and BD=√80. So yes, all four faces are congruent triangles with sides √41, √80, √89. So that's helpful because all faces are congruent, so their areas will be equal.

So if all four faces have the same area, then the sum of the areas is 4 times one face's area. So maybe I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four. Let me compute the area of one face.

First, let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = √41, b = √80, c = √89.

Wait, perhaps it's better to square the sides to make calculations easier.

So, a² = 41, b² = 80, c² = 89.

I can use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2, but since a, b, c are square roots, maybe it's easier to compute s squared? Or maybe not. Let's compute s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2. Hmm, that might be messy. Alternatively, maybe use the formula for area in terms of side lengths: Heron's formula is √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

But that would involve square roots within square roots, which could get complicated. Alternatively, I can compute the area using the cosine law and then find the sine for the area formula (1/2 ab sinθ).

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the triangle with sides √41, √80, √89 is a right triangle? Let's check if 41 + 80 = 89.

41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², but 89² is 7921, which is much larger. Wait, wait, no, that's not the right approach. To check if it's a right triangle, the sum of squares of two sides should equal the square of the third.

So 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², but the third side squared is 89, which is not 121. Wait, 89 is 89, not 121. So 41 +80=121≠89, so it's not a right triangle. Similarly, 41 +89=130, which is not 80, and 80+89=169, which is 13². Wait, 80 + 89 = 169, which is 13². So 80 +89 =169, but the other side is 41, which is 41, not 169. So it's not a right triangle. So perhaps we need to compute the area using Heron's formula.

Wait, but I can compute the area squared using Heron's formula, and then take the square root. Let me try.

Compute s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

But that's going to be messy. Alternatively, maybe use the formula for area in terms of vectors or coordinates? Hmm, but I don't have coordinates yet.

Wait, maybe it's better to find the volume first, then find the inradius. But to find the volume, maybe I need the edge lengths and use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Since I know all the edge lengths, perhaps that's the way to go.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt[ CM / 288 ], where CM is the determinant of the matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

So, in our case, AB = √41, so a = √41, AC = √80, b = √80, AD=√89, c=√89. Then, BC=√89, which is d = √89, BD=√80, e=√80, CD=√41, f=√41.

So, let's plug these into the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Wait, the matrix is 5x5:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, a²=41, b²=80, c²=89

Row 2: 1, a²=41, 0, d²=89, e²=80

Row 3: 1, b²=80, d²=89, 0, f²=41

Row 4: 1, c²=89, e²=80, f²=41, 0

So, the determinant of this matrix is the CM determinant.

Let me write this matrix out:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Calculating this determinant seems complicated, but maybe we can simplify by using properties of determinants or maybe subtracting rows to create zeros.

Alternatively, perhaps compute it step by step.

But maybe I should note that since all face areas are equal, perhaps the volume can be found via another method, but perhaps not. Let me just proceed with computing the determinant.

Wait, let me recall that the Cayley-Menger determinant for four points in 3D space is given by:

CM = determinant of the above matrix.

And Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

But I need to compute CM.

This is going to be a 5x5 determinant, which is tedious. Let me see if I can find a pattern or simplify.

Let me denote the matrix as M. So, M is a 5x5 matrix with first row [0,1,1,1,1], and the other rows have the squared distances.

Alternatively, perhaps use cofactor expansion, but that's going to be time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe notice that the matrix is symmetric, so perhaps eigenvalues can be used, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe subtract some rows to create zeros.

Let me try subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2,3,4.

So, new Row 2 = Row2 - Row1: [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] = [0,41,-41,9,-9]

Similarly, new Row3 = Row3 - Row1: [1-1,80-0,89-41,0-80,41-89] = [0,80,48,-80,-48]

New Row4 = Row4 - Row1: [1-1,89-0,80-41,41-80,0-89] = [0,89,39,-39,-89]

Row0 remains [0,1,1,1,1]

So the matrix now is:

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 1, 0,41,80,89

Row2: 0,41,-41,9,-9

Row3: 0,80,48,-80,-48

Row4: 0,89,39,-39,-89

Now, let's compute the determinant. Since the first column is [0,1,0,0,0], the determinant can be expanded along the first column.

The determinant is: 0 * minor - 1 * minor + 0 - 0 + 0. So only the second term (from Row1, Column1) contributes.

The minor for element M[1,1] is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing Row1 and Column1.

So, the minor matrix is:

Row0: [1,1,1,1]

Row2: [41,-41,9,-9]

Row3: [80,48,-80,-48]

Row4: [89,39,-39,-89]

So, the minor is the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.

Let me denote this matrix as N:

N = [
[1,1,1,1],
[41,-41,9,-9],
[80,48,-80,-48],
[89,39,-39,-89]
]

We need to compute det(N).

This is a 4x4 determinant. Let me try to simplify it by expanding or row operations.

I notice that the first row is all ones. Let me subtract the first row from the other rows to create zeros.

New Row2 = Row2 - 41*Row1: [41-41*1, -41-41*1, 9 -41*1, -9 -41*1] = [0, -82, -32, -50]

Similarly, Row3 = Row3 -80*Row1: [80-80*1, 48 -80*1, -80 -80*1, -48 -80*1] = [0, -32, -160, -128]

Row4 = Row4 -89*Row1: [89-89*1, 39 -89*1, -39 -89*1, -89 -89*1] = [0, -50, -128, -178]

So now, the matrix N becomes:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row2: [0, -82, -32, -50]

Row3: [0, -32, -160, -128]

Row4: [0, -50, -128, -178]

Now, the determinant of N is the same as the determinant of this transformed matrix.

Since the first column has 1 followed by zeros, we can expand along the first column.

det(N) = 1 * det of the minor matrix obtained by removing Row0 and Column0:

minor = [
[-82, -32, -50],
[-32, -160, -128],
[-50, -128, -178]
]

So, compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.

Let me denote this minor as P.

P = [
[-82, -32, -50],
[-32, -160, -128],
[-50, -128, -178]
]

Compute det(P):

Using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.

I think cofactor expansion might be more manageable here.

Let me compute along the first row.

det(P) = (-82) * det[ (-160, -128), (-128, -178) ] - (-32) * det[ (-32, -128), (-50, -178) ] + (-50) * det[ (-32, -160), (-50, -128) ]

Compute each minor:

First minor: det[ (-160, -128), (-128, -178) ]

= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128)
= (160*178) - (128^2)
Compute 160*178: 160*(180-2) = 160*180=28800 - 160*2=320 → 28800-320=28480
128^2 = 16384
So, 28480 - 16384 = 12096

Second minor: det[ (-32, -128), (-50, -178) ]

= (-32)*(-178) - (-128)*(-50)
= (32*178) - (128*50)
32*178: 32*(180-2)=5760 -64=5696
128*50=6400
So, 5696 -6400= -704

Third minor: det[ (-32, -160), (-50, -128) ]

= (-32)*(-128) - (-160)*(-50)
= (32*128) - (160*50)
32*128=4096
160*50=8000
So, 4096 -8000= -3904

Now, putting it all together:

det(P) = (-82)*(12096) - (-32)*(-704) + (-50)*(-3904)

Compute each term:

First term: (-82)*12096 = -82*12096. Let's compute 82*12000=984000, 82*96=7872, so total 984000 +7872= 991,872. So, first term is -991872.

Second term: - (-32)*(-704) = - (32*704). 32*700=22400, 32*4=128, total 22528. So, second term is -22528.

Third term: (-50)*(-3904) = 50*3904 = 195,200.

So, det(P) = (-991872) + (-22528) + 195200

Wait, no:

Wait, first term is (-82)*12096 = -991,872

Second term is - [ (-32)*(-704) ] = - [ 32*704 ] = -22,528

Third term is + [ (-50)*(-3904) ] = + 195,200

So, summing up:

-991,872 -22,528 +195,200

First, -991,872 -22,528 = -1,014,400

Then, -1,014,400 + 195,200 = -819,200

So, det(P) = -819,200

Therefore, det(N) = 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200

Wait, but wait, the original determinant was of the 4x4 matrix N, which was transformed from the 5x5 matrix. So, the minor we computed is -819,200. But since the sign in the expansion was positive (since it's (1,1) position, which is (+) in the checkerboard), so det(N) is -819,200.

But wait, let me double-check. When expanding the determinant, the sign alternates as (+ - + -) for the first row. So, the (1,1) element is +, (1,2) is -, etc. So, when we expanded along the first column, the minor for Row1, Column1 was correct with a + sign.

Therefore, det(N) = (-819,200)

But wait, that can't be right because determinants can be positive or negative, but the volume is the square root of the absolute value.

Wait, the Cayley-Menger determinant is CM = determinant(M). The volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

So, CM is the determinant of the 5x5 matrix, which we've been computing. But let's recap:

We started with the 5x5 matrix, then subtracted Row1 from Rows 2,3,4, which gave us a matrix where Rows 2,3,4 had zeros in the first column. Then, expanding along the first column, we found that the determinant is (-1)^{1+1} * 1 * det(N), where det(N) is -819,200. So, det(M) = det(N) = -819,200.

Wait, but no, actually, the expansion factor is (-1)^{i+j} * M_ij * det(minor). So for element (1,1), it's (+1) * 1 * det(N). So, det(M) = (+1)*1*(-819200) = -819200.

But the volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). So, Volume = sqrt( 819200 / 288 )

Simplify 819200 / 288.

Let me compute 819200 ÷ 288.

First, factor numerator and denominator.

819200 = 8192 * 100 = 2^13 * 2^2 * 5^2 = 2^15 * 5^2.

Wait, 8192 is 2^13, so 819200 = 2^13 * 100 = 2^13 * 2^2 * 5^2 = 2^15 *5^2.

Denominator 288 = 16 * 18 = 2^5 * 3^2.

So, 819200 / 288 = (2^15 *5^2) / (2^5 *3^2) )= 2^(15-5) *5^2 /3^2 = 2^10 *25 /9 = 1024 *25 /9 = 25600 /9.

So, Volume = sqrt(25600 /9 ) = (sqrt(25600))/3 = 160 /3.

So, volume V = 160 /3.

Now, I need the areas of the faces. Since all four faces are congruent triangles with sides √41, √80, √89, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC.

Sides a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

Earlier, I tried to compute the area via Heron's formula but got stuck because the sides are square roots. Let me try again.

Compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

But Heron's formula requires s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c), which is going to be messy. Alternatively, maybe use the formula (1/2)ab sinθ, but I don't know θ.

Wait, perhaps use the formula based on vectors or coordinates? Maybe if I can assign coordinates to the points, I could compute the area more easily.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Since all four faces are congruent, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral, and perhaps its volume can be expressed in terms of the face area and some height.

Alternatively, maybe use the formula for the area in terms of the sides. For a triangle with sides a, b, c, the area can also be calculated using the formula:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

Wait, that's Heron's formula squared. So, Area^2 = s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c), where s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, if I compute the square of the area, I can take the square root at the end.

Let me compute s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c) for a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Let me denote:

a = √41, b = √80, c = √89.

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

Compute s - a = (-√41 + √80 + √89)/2

s - b = (√41 - √80 + √89)/2

s - c = (√41 + √80 - √89)/2

So, s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) is the product of four terms, each of which is half the sum or difference of square roots.

This seems complicated, but maybe we can compute it as follows:

Let me compute s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = [ (a + b + c)/2 ] * [ (-a + b + c)/2 ] * [ (a - b + c)/2 ] * [ (a + b - c)/2 ]

Which is equal to [ (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) ] / 16

But let me compute numerator:

Let me denote:

Let me compute (a + b + c)(-a + b + c) = ( (b + c)^2 - a^2 )

Similarly, (a - b + c)(a + b - c) = (a^2 - (b - c)^2 )

So:

First term: (b + c)^2 - a^2 = (b^2 + 2bc + c^2) - a^2

Second term: a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2

Multiply these two:

[ (b² + 2bc + c² - a²) ] * [ (a² - b² - c² + 2bc) ]

Let me denote X = a², Y = b², Z = c².

So, first factor: (Y + 2√(Y Z) + Z - X)

Wait, no, in our case, a, b, c are √41, √80, √89, so a² =41, b²=80, c²=89.

So, let me substitute:

First factor: (80 + 2*sqrt(80*89) + 89 -41) = (80 +89 -41) + 2*sqrt(80*89) = 128 + 2*sqrt(7120)

Second factor: (41 -80 -89 + 2*sqrt(80*89)) = (41 -169) + 2*sqrt(7120) = (-128) + 2*sqrt(7120)

So, the product becomes:

(128 + 2√7120)(-128 + 2√7120) = [ (2√7120)^2 - (128)^2 ]

Compute:

(2√7120)^2 = 4 *7120 = 28480

128^2 = 16384

So, the product is 28480 -16384 = 12096

So, the numerator is 12096, denominator is 16

Thus, s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c) = 12096 /16 = 756

Therefore, Area^2 =756, so Area = sqrt(756)

Simplify sqrt(756):

756 = 4 * 189 = 4 * 9 *21 = 4*9*3*7 → 2²*3²*3*7

So, sqrt(756) = 2*3*sqrt(21) =6√21

Therefore, the area of each face is6√21.

Since there are four faces, the total surface area is4*6√21=24√21.

Wait, but no, the total surface area is the sum of the areas of all four faces. Since each face is 6√21, total is 4*6√21 =24√21.

Wait, but in the formula for inradius, it's r = 3V / A_total, where A_total is the sum of the areas.

So, r = 3V / A_total.

We have V=160/3, and A_total=24√21.

So, r= 3*(160/3) / (24√21) = (160) / (24√21) = (20/3) / √21

Simplify 20/(3√21). Rationalize the denominator:

20/(3√21) = 20√21/(3*21) = 20√21/(63) = (20/63)√21.

Simplify 20 and 63: 20 and 63 are coprime, since 20 factors into 2²*5, and 63 is 7*3², no common factors.

Also, 21 is square-free (no square factors), so the expression is in simplest terms.

So, r= (20√21)/63.

Thus, m=20, n=21, p=63.

But wait, 20 and 63: gcd(20,63)=1, right? 20 factors are 2²*5, 63 is 7*3². No common factors, so yes, reduced.

n=21 is square-free because 21=3*7, no square factors.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Then, m +n +p=20 +21 +63=104.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the calculations.

First, the volume was found using Cayley-Menger determinant as 160/3.

Each face area is 6√21, so four faces give 24√21.

Then, r=3V/(A_total)=3*(160/3)/(24√21)=160/(24√21)= (20/3)/√21=20√21/(3*21)=20√21/63.

Yes, that's correct.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 104.

I think that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the given tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The determinant is calculated as follows:

The Cayley-Menger matrix for the given edge lengths is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

After simplifying the determinant, we find that the volume \( V \) is \( \frac{160}{3} \).

Next, we calculate the area of one of the congruent triangular faces. Each face has sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is found to be \( 6\sqrt{21} \). Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area \( A_{\text{total}} \) is \( 24\sqrt{21} \).

The inradius \( r \) is given by the formula:
\[
r = \frac{3V}{A_{\text{total}}}
\]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[
r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]
Thus, the distance from the incenter to each face is \( \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63} \).

Finally, the values are \( m = 20 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \). Summing these gives:
\[
m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]
