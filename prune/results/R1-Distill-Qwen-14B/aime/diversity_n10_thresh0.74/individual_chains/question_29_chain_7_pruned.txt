Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, drawn such that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Rectangles ABCD and EFGH. So rectangle ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. So EF = 184, FG = 17, so GH = EF = 184 and HE = FG =17.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. So the line goes through D, E, C, F in some order. Wait, but D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, and F is a corner of rectangle EFGH. Hmm.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting because four points lying on a circle mean they are concyclic or lie on a circumcircle. So, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Alright, let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Let's assume rectangle ABCD is positioned such that AB is horizontal, so BC is vertical. So point A is bottom-left, B is bottom-right, C is top-right, D is top-left. Similarly, rectangle EFGH: since EF is a long side (184) and FG is 17, EF is horizontal, FG is vertical.

Wait, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So the line passes through D, E, C, F. So D is top-left of ABCD, and C is top-right of ABCD. So the line passes through D, C, and then E and F are somewhere on that line beyond C? Or maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me think about the cyclic quadrilateral. Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. A is a corner of ABCD, D is another corner of ABCD, H is a corner of EFGH, and G is another corner of EFGH.

So, maybe the rectangles are arranged in such a way that one rectangle is attached to the other along that line D, E, C, F, and the points A, D, H, G are concyclic.

Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates to the points to make this more concrete. Assigning coordinate system might help.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC = 16, AB = 107.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, if D is at (0,
