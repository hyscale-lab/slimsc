Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, a regular octagon has 8 sides, so 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue with equal probability, so each color has a 50% chance. That means the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. So the sample space has 256 possible colorings.

Now, we need to find the number of colorings where there's a rotation that maps all blue vertices to the positions of red ones. Wait, so after rotation, every blue vertex should be on a spot that was originally red. That implies that the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices. Hmm, or maybe that the blue vertices are a rotation of the red vertices.

Wait, but since we're rotating the octagon, each rotation is a symmetry operation. So, for each coloring, we want to know if the blue vertices can be mapped to the red vertices via some rotation. Alternatively, the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

But since each vertex is either red or blue, the set of blue vertices is the complement of the set of red vertices. So if rotating the octagon can map blue vertices to red ones, then the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Which would mean that the red set is a rotation of the blue set, but since blue is the complement of red, maybe that implies something about the red set being symmetric under some rotation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of orbit structures. Since the octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8 (rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째), each coloring can be rotated and we need to see if one of these rotations maps blue to red.

But maybe another way is to consider that the blue vertices must be exactly the image of the red vertices under some rotation. So, if we denote R as the set of red vertices and B as the set of blue vertices, we need that R is equal to
