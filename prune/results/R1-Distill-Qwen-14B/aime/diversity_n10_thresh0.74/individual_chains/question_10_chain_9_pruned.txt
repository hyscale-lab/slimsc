Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again:

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. So Alice picks a set A. Then Bob creates a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. And the number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me break this down. First, I need to understand what Bob's list consists of. Bob is considering all finite, non-empty sets B, so each B is a finite set of positive integers. The condition is that the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element m in A, Bob can form sets B where the maximum is m, and the other elements are any positive integers less than m.

Wait, right. So for each m in A, the number of possible sets B where the maximum is m is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, since each such subset can be combined with m to form a set B where m is the maximum. But since B must be non-empty, for each m, the number of such sets is 2^{m-1}. Because each element less than m can either be included or not, giving 2^{m-1} subsets, including the empty set. But wait, B has to be non-empty. But if we include m, even if all the others are excluded, B is just {m}, which is allowed. So the number of sets for each m is 2^{m-1}.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a given m in A, the maximum element is m, so the other elements of B must be a subset of {1,2,...,m-1}. The number of possible subsets is 2^{m-1}, including the empty subset. So each of these subsets union {m} forms a set B where the maximum is m. So yes, for each m, the number is 2^{m-1}.

But wait, do we include the empty set? Because if we take the empty subset, union with {m}, we get {m}, which is a valid set B. So yes, each m contributes 2^{m-1} sets. So the total number of sets B is the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1}.

But wait, is that correct? Because for each m, it's 2^{m-1} sets, but do we have to worry about overlapping sets? Like, suppose m is in A and so is n, with m < n, then a set B with maximum n could include m, but that's okay because the maximum is still n. So each set B is counted exactly once for its maximum element, so there's no overlap. So Bob's total number of sets is the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1}.

So according to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So, the equation is:

sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} =
