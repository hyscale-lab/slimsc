Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers, and then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, A is a set of positive integers. Bob is creating sets B where each B is finite, nonempty, and the maximum element of B is in A. So, how does Bob come up with these sets?

I think for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where the maximum is a. So, for each a in A, the number of such sets B would be the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} combined with the element a. Wait, because the maximum is a, the other elements of B must be less than a.

So, for each a in A, the number of sets B with maximum a is equal to 2^{a-1}. Because for each number less than a, we can choose whether or not to include it in B. So, the total number of such sets for a particular a is 2^{a-1}.

But wait, since the set B must be non-empty, does that mean we have to subtract the empty set? No, because 2^{a-1} already counts all subsets, including the empty set, but when we add a as the maximum, the set becomes non-empty. So, for each a, the number is 2^{a-1}.

So, the total number of sets Bob lists is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. And we're told that this sum is 2024.

So, the equation is: sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of the elements of A. Let me denote S as the sum of elements in A, so S = sum_{a in A} a.

So, we're given that sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024, and we need to find S.

I need to figure out what A could be. It's a set of positive integers, so each a is unique.

First, I can think about the binary representation of 2024. Because 2^{a-1} are
