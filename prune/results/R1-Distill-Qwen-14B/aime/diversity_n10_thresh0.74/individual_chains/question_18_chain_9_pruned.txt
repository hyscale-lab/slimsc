Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram shows three examples, but I don't have the diagram, so I need to visualize it or maybe sketch it out.

Hmm, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? But maybe that's not directly relevant here. The key is that it's regular, so it's symmetric, which might help in counting the rectangles.

So, the problem is about forming rectangles using the sides and diagonals of this dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the rectangle's edges can't be arbitrary lines; they have to align with the existing sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

I think the approach here is to consider how rectangles can be formed by selecting vertices of the dodecagon such that the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the angles are 90 degrees. But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the same, but the diagonals can vary in length depending on how many vertices they skip.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, a diagonal is a line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. In a dodecagon, the diagonals can be of different lengths. For example, connecting adjacent vertices is a side, then the next is a diagonal that skips one vertex, and so on, up to skipping five vertices, because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating on the other side.

So, in a regular dodecagon, diagonals can be categorized by the number of vertices they skip. So, for example, in a 12-gon, the diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 vertices. Wait, no, actually, in an n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is n(n-3)/2, but the number of distinct lengths depends on whether n is even or odd. For a dodecagon, which is even-sided, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is n/2 - 1. So, for 12, that would be
