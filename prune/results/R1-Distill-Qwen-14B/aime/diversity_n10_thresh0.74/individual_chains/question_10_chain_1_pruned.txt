Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. Alice picks set A, and then Bob looks at all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. So, I need to figure out what A could be such that the number of these sets B is 2024, and then sum the elements of A.

Let me think about how Bob constructs these sets B. Each set B is finite and non-empty, and the maximum element is in A. So, for each element m in A, we can think about how many sets B have m as their maximum.

Suppose m is the maximum element of B. Then the other elements of B must be less than m and can be any positive integers. So, for each m in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum m is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}. Since each such subset can be combined with the element m to form a set B where m is the maximum.

Wait, subsets. For a given m, the number of possible B's where m is the maximum is 2^(m-1). Because the elements less than m can be any combination, including none. But since B has to be non-empty, wait, but m is always included, so the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, which has size 2^(m-1). So for each m in A, the number of sets B with maximum m is 2^(m-1).

Therefore, the total number of such sets B is the sum over all m in A of 2^(m-1). And according to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So, mathematically, sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

Hmm. So, I need to find all possible sets A such that the sum of 2^{m-1} for each m in A is 2024, and then find the sum of elements in A.

Wait, but A is a set of positive integers. So, each m is at least 1, and they are unique.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set A where the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1} equals 2024.

Now, perhaps I can think of 2024 in terms of binary or powers of 2, to see how it can be expressed as a sum of distinct terms of 2^{m-1}.

Let me compute 2024 in binary.

Wait, 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048. So 2024 is between 2^10 and 2^11.

Let me compute 2024 in binary:

2024 divided by 2: 2024/2 = 1012, remainder 0

1012/
