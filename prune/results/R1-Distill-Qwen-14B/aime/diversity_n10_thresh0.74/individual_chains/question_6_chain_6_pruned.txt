Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are a bit complicated, so I'll take it step by step.

First, let me parse the functions involved. The problem defines two functions, f(x) and g(x), as follows:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Then, the two equations we're dealing with are:

1. y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

We need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations simultaneously. That is, find all (x, y) where y is given by the first equation and x is given by the second equation, so plugging one into the other might help.

Hmm, but since both equations involve these functions f and g composed with sine and cosine, maybe it's better to analyze each function's behavior first.

Let me start by understanding what f(x) and g(x) look like.

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|

The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. Then taking the absolute value of that. So, the graph of f(x) will be V-shaped, but with the vertex where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = ±1/2. So the vertex is at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). Then, for |x| > 1/2, the value of f(x) will be |x| - 1/2, while for |x| < 1/2, it will be -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Same idea. Start with |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So the vertex occurs where |x| - 1/4 = 0, which is at x = ±1/4. For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4; for |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So both f and g are piecewise linear functions, creating V-shapes with different vertices.

Now, I need to figure out what 4*g(f(...)) looks like for both equations.

Starting with the first equation: y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))).

Let's break it down.

First, sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, since the period of sin(2πx) is 1. So for each integer x, it completes a full cycle.

So the input to f is sin(2πx), which ranges between -1 and 1. So f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Let me compute this:

First, |sin(2πx)| is a non-negative value between 0 and 1.

Then, subtracting 1/2: so |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 can range from -1/2 (when |sin(2πx)| is 0) to 1/2 (when |sin(2πx)| is 1).

Taking the absolute value of that: ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Let's denote z = |sin(2πx)|.

Then, f(z) = |z - 1/2|.

So f(z) is 1/2 - z when z < 1/2, and z - 1/2 when z >= 1/2.

So f(z) is a V-shape with the minimum at z=1/2.

Since z ranges from 0 to 1, the maximum of f(z) is when z is 0 or 1, which would be 1/2.

So f(z) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g(f(z)) = ||f(z) - 1/4|.

Since f(z) is between 0 and 1/2, f(z) - 1/4 can be between -1/4 and 1/4.

Taking absolute value: |f(z) - 1/4|.

So let's compute this.

Case 1: f(z) >= 1/4, which is when |z - 1/2| >= 1/4. Wait, but f(z) = |z - 1/2|.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider when f(z) is >= 1/4 and when it's <1/4.

Wait, f(z) = |z - 1/2|, so f(z) is in [0,1/2].

So, f(z) - 1/4 can be negative when f(z) < 1/4, and positive otherwise.

So:

If f(z) >= 1/4, then |f(z) - 1/4| = f(z) - 1/4.

If f(z) < 1/4, then |f(z) - 1/4| = 1/4 - f(z).

Therefore, g(f(z)) is:

- 1/4 - f(z) when f(z) < 1/4,

- f(z) - 1/4 when f(z) >= 1/4.

But since f(z) is |z - 1/2|, let me express z as |sin(2πx)|.

Wait, maybe it's better to graph these functions or find their ranges.

Wait, since f(z) = |z - 1/2|, and z is between 0 and 1, f(z) ranges from 0 (at z=1/2) to 1/2 (at z=0 and z=1).

So, when f(z) >= 1/4, which happens when |z - 1/2| >= 1/4.

Which implies z >= 1/2 + 1/4 or z <= 1/2 -1/4. So z >= 3/4 or z <= 1/4.

Since z = |sin(2πx)|, which is in [0,1].

So g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4 when z >= 3/4 or z <= 1/4.

And g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z) when z is between 1/4 and 3/4.

Hmm, so let's model g(f(z)).

g(f(z)) = | |z - 1/2| - 1/4 |.

Which can be rewritten as | |z - 1/2| - 1/4 |.

Wait, that's the same as ||z -1/2| - 1/4|, which is the definition of g(f(z
