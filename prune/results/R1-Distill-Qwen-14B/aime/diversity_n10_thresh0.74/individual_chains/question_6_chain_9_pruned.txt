Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are a bit complicated, involving functions f and g composed with sine and cosine, and then scaled by 4. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me write down the functions as given.

f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|. Hmm, wait—that's the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2. So f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.

The two graphs I'm dealing with are:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

I need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations. That is, I need to find the number of solutions (x, y) such that when I plug x into the first equation, I get y, and then plug y into the second equation, I get x.

But wait, the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So if I have a y from the first equation, I can plug that into the second equation to find x. But since the first equation gives y in terms of x, it's a bit of a loop.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between x and y by substituting one into the other. Let me think.

Let me first understand what f and g do. Both are functions involving absolute values, so they are piecewise linear and have V-shapes.

Let me plot f(x) and g(x) in my mind.

For f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 shifts it down, so the graph would have vertices at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, the negative part is flipped up.

So f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |. So where does f(x) = 0? When |x| = 1/2. So at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2, f(x) is zero. The function will have a V-shape between these points.

Wait, let me think more carefully.

The expression inside the absolute value is |x| - 1/2. So for |x| >= 1/2, this is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| -1/2. For |x| < 1/2, this is negative, so f(x) becomes 1/2 - |x|.

So f(x) looks like a V with the vertex at x=0, but it's actually a W shape. Because when |x| <1/2, it's a downward slope, and when |x| >1/2, it's upward.

Wait no, actually, f(x) is | |x|
