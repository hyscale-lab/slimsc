Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear. Hmm, that means they lie on the same straight line. Also, all the points A, D, H, and G lie on a circle. Interesting. I'm trying to imagine how these rectangles are placed relative to each other.

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. I need to find the length of CE. 

Wait, so rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, that makes ABCD a rectangle where AB is the length and BC is the width. So, AB is 107 units long, BC is 16 units. Therefore, AD would also be 16, and DC would be 107.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is 184, FG is 17. So, EF is the length, FG is the width. So, EF is 184, FG is 17, so EH and HG would be 17, and FG and EH are 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. So, the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. So, the order is D-E-C-F.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That's a key point. So, the four points A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.

I think drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll have to visualize it. Let's try to think about the coordinates.

Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) to make it easier. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0) because DC is 107. Then, since BC is 16, point B would be at (107,16), and point A would be at (0,16).

Wait, but if A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), so AD is vertical. Now, rectangle EFGH: since D, E, C, F are collinear, and E and F are on that line. Let me see.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line l. So, line l passes through D(0,0), then E, then C(107,0), then F.

But wait, if D and C are both on this line, but in rectangle ABCD, DC is a side, so DC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). So,
