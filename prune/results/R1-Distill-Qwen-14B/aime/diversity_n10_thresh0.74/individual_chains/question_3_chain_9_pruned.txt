Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem is about a lottery where Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She gets the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this sounds like a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if A is the event that she wins the grand prize, and B is the event that she wins a prize, then A is a subset of B because winning the grand prize means she definitely won a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that she wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize. Then, divide them.

First, let's figure out the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 elements, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). Let me compute that: 10 choose 4 is (10×9×8×7)/(4×3×2×1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers.

Now, the probability of winning the grand prize, P(A), is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since she picks 4 specific numbers, there is only 1 favorable outcome (the set of her numbers) out of 210 possible. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, the probability of winning a prize, P(B), is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, she wins if exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers are among the chosen 4.

So, to compute P(B), I should find the number of favorable outcomes for each case (exactly 2, exactly 3, exactly 4) and add them up, then divide by the total number of possible outcomes (210).

Let me compute each case separately.

Case 1: Exactly 2 of her numbers are chosen. How many ways can this happen? Well, Jen has 4 numbers, and we need to choose 2 of them. The number of ways to choose 2 from her 4 is C(4,2). Then, the remaining 2 numbers must come from the other 6 numbers in S (since S has 10, and she has 4, so 10 - 4 = 6). So, the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 is C(6,2). So, the total number of favorable outcomes for exactly 2 is C(4,2) * C(6,2).

Similarly, for Case 2: Exactly 3 of her numbers are chosen. The number of ways is C(4,3) * C(6,1). Because we choose 3 from her 4, and 1 from the remaining 6.

Case 3: Exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen, which is exactly the grand prize scenario. As before, that's just 1 way.

So, let's compute each of these.

Compute C(4,2) * C(6,2):

C(4,2) is (4×3)/(2×1) = 6.

C(6,2) is (6×5)/(2×1) = 15.

So, 6 * 15 = 90.

Next, Case 2: C(4,3) * C(6,1):

C(4,3) is 4.

C(6,1) is 6.

So, 4 * 6 = 24.

Case 3 is 1, as established.

So, total favorable outcomes for B (at least 2) is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Wait, let me double-check that addition: 90 + 24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yep.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize is 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 115 ÷5 =23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

Wait, no: 115 divided by 5 is 23, and 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, 23/42. Correct.

So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on a second. Let me check my math again because 90 +24 +1 is 115. Yes, and 210 is the total number of possible combinations. So, 115/210 is correct.

Simplify: 115 / 210. Let's
