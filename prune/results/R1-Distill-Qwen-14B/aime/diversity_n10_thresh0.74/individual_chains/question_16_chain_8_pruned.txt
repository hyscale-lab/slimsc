Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, right. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Then, once I have that p, find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me break this down. I think I should start by checking small primes and see if they satisfy the condition where n⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

Wait, so for each prime p, I need to check if there's an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². If such an n exists, then p is a candidate. The smallest such p would be the answer for the first part.

So, the primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. Let me check each one.

Starting with p=2: p²=4. So, we need n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4. For n=1: 1 +1=2 mod4, which isn't 0. n=2: 16 +1=17≡1 mod4. n=3: 81+1=82≡2 mod4. Hmm, n=0: 0+1=1 mod4. So, for p=2, is there any n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4? It seems not. So p=2 doesn't work.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe n=1: 1 +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod4. So no, p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. p²=9. So, looking for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9, which is equivalent to n⁴ ≡8 mod9.

Let me compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9 → 1 ≠8
n=2: 16 mod9=7 → 7≠8
n=3: 81 mod9=0 → 0≠8
n=4: 256 mod9. Let's see, 256 ÷9: 9*28=252, remainder 4. So 4 mod9.
n=5: 625 mod9. Let's calculate 625-9*69=625-621=4. So 4 mod9.
n=6: 1296 mod9=0.
n=7: 7⁴= (7²)²=49². 49 mod9 is 4. 4²=16 mod9=7. So 7 mod9.
n=8: 8⁴= (8²)²=64². 64 mod9: 64-7*9=64-63=1. So 1²=1 mod9.

So, for p=3, none of the n from 1 to8 gives n⁴ ≡8 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Moving on to p=5. p²=25. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25, which is 24 mod25.

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for some n. Since 25 is manageable, perhaps I can find such an n.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. For n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25, then n⁸
