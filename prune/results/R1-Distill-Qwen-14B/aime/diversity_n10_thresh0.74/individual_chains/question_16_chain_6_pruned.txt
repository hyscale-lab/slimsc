Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ +1 is divisible by p squared. Then, once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p squared.

I remember that primes p for which -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. That is, there exists some n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But here, we're talking about p squared, so maybe Hensel's lemma applies? Or maybe I need to look into higher congruences.

Wait, let's start simple. For primes p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, p must satisfy certain conditions. I think for primes p, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p implies that the order of n modulo p divides 8, because (n⁴)² ≡ 1 mod p. So the order is 8, which means 8 divides p-1, because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. If n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p is 8, which must divide p-1 because the multiplicative group has order p-1. So yes, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So the smallest primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 97,  etc. Wait, no: 17 is 1 mod 8, because 16 is 0 mod 8. What's the next one? Let's see: 8k +1. So 17, 41, 73, 89, 97, etc.

Wait, but wait: 2 is a prime, but 2 is very small. Let's check if 2 satisfies the condition. If p=2, does there exist an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4? Let's see: n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 would be 1 or 2 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 can't be divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Similarly, p=3: Let's see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 3. So n can be 0,1,2 mod3. Compute n⁴ mod3:

0⁴=0, 1⁴=1, 2⁴=16≡1 mod3. So n⁴ can only be 0 or 1 mod3. So n⁴ +1 can be 1 or 2 mod3. So n⁴ +1 can't be 0 mod3. So p=3 is out
