Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have points O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). These are in the first quadrant, right? So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for every such segment PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1.

So, the distance between P and Q is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. That gives the equation p² + q² = 1. So, all such points (p, q) lie on the unit circle in the first quadrant. Therefore, the family F is all the segments connecting (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F besides AB. So, C is a point on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F except for AB itself. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

First, let me find the equation of segment AB. Points A are at (1/2, 0) and point B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the line AB can be found using the two-point form.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A, (1/2, 0): 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, any point C on AB can be parameterized as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

We need to find such a point C where it's not on any other segment PQ from F except for AB. So, for C to not lie on any other PQ, except AB, the only segment PQ from F that passes through C is AB itself.

Let me think: Each segment PQ corresponds to a line connecting (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1. So, the family F is the set of all such lines.

We're looking for a point C on AB such that only the line AB (which is PQ for some specific p and q) passes through C, and no other PQ from F passes through C. So, C is the intersection point of AB with some PQ, but no other PQ from F.

Wait, but AB is already a member of F. Let me check: AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute p and q here. p is 1/2, q is sqrt(3)/2. Then p² + q² = (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a member of F.

So, AB is PQ where p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. So, C is a point on AB, but not on any other PQ in F. So, we need to find such a point C where, except for AB, no other segment from F passes through it.

So, to find C, we can parametrize AB as I did before: let’s denote point C as (t, y(t)), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2, and y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2.

Suppose another segment PQ from F passes through C. So, PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1, and the line PQ passes through (t, y(t)).

We need to find t such that the only PQ that passes through (t, y(t)) is AB itself. So, for this t, the system of equations:

1. The equation of PQ: x/p + y/q = 1.

2. The point (t, y(t)) lies on PQ: t/p + y(t)/q = 1.

Additionally, since PQ has unit length, p² + q² = 1.

We need to find t such that there's only one solution (p, q) to the above equations, which is p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.

So, for all other t, except possibly at some unique t, there might be another PQ from F that passes through (t, y(t)). But for the unique C, no other PQ passes through it.

Wait, but how do we ensure that? Maybe we can think in terms of the envelope of the family F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if C is on the envelope, then it's only on AB and one other PQ, but we need it to be only on AB. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is such that AB is the only PQ that passes through it. So, for all other PQ's in F, the equation t/p + y(t)/q = 1 would have no solution except when p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but for each t, there might be a unique PQ passing through (t, y(t)), except when the point is on AB. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, for points on AB, but not A or B, whether they lie on other PQ's.

Wait, maybe the point C is such that it is the only point on AB that is not intersected by any other PQ from F.

So, perhaps the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. So, the envelope of all PQ's would be a curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C. Therefore, point C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence, only AB passes through C, while other PQ's don't.

Hmm, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, in this case, the envelope would be the curve that is tangent to each PQ segment. So, perhaps the envelope is the unit circle? Wait, no, because each PQ is a line segment, not the circle itself.

Wait, the family F consists of lines x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1, p > 0, q > 0.

So, let's consider the family of lines x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1. We can think of this as a one-parameter family, perhaps parameterized by p or q.

To find the envelope, we can use the standard method: for each line in the family, find the point where it's tangent to the envelope. The envelope satisfies both the equation of the line and the derivative condition.

Let me parameterize the family using p. So, q is determined by p: q = sqrt(1 - p²).

So, the line equation is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

To find the envelope, we can take the derivative with respect to p and solve the system.

Let me denote F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) - 1 = 0.

The envelope is found by solving F(p, x, y) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

Compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = -x/p² + (y * (p)) / ( (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) = 0.

So, we have two equations:

1) x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

2) -x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

Let me try to solve these two equations for x and y in terms of p.

From equation 2:

-x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0

=> y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x / p²

=> y = x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p^3.

Now, substitute y into equation 1:

x/p + [x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p^3 ] / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1

Simplify the second term:

[ x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p^3 ] / sqrt(1 - p²) = x (1 - p²) / p^3

So, equation becomes:

x/p + x (1 - p²)/ p^3 = 1

Factor x:

x [ 1/p + (1 - p²)/p^3 ] = 1

Compute the term in brackets:

1/p + (1 - p²)/p^3 = (p² + 1 - p²) / p^3 = 1/p^3.

So, x * (1/p^3) = 1 => x = p^3.

Then, from earlier, y = x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p^3 = p^3 * (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p^3 = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, the envelope is parametrized as:

x = p^3,

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

We can also write this in terms of x and y by eliminating p.

From x = p^3, we get p = x^(1/3).

Substituting into y:

y = (1 - (x^(1/3))^2)^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

So, the envelope is the curve y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Let me check the endpoints. When p approaches 0, x approaches 0, y approaches 1. When p=1, x=1, y=0. Hmm, but p is between 0 and 1 since p² + q² =1.

Wait, but in our problem, the family F consists of segments in the first quadrant, so p and q are positive and less than or equal to 1. So, the envelope is the curve y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Now, we need to find the point C on AB that is also on this envelope. Because if C is on the envelope, then it's tangent to AB, meaning that AB is the only PQ that passes through C.

Wait, no. Because AB is one of the PQs in F, so the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each PQ at some point. So, if C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, then it's the only point where AB meets the envelope, and hence, C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope.

But in our problem, we need the point C on AB that is not on any other PQ from F, except AB itself. So, perhaps C is the point where AB meets the envelope, meaning that it's the only point where AB and the envelope coincide, and hence, no other PQ from F passes through C.

So, let's find the intersection point between AB and the envelope.

Equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Equation of envelope: y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

So, set them equal:

-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Let me denote t = x^(1/3), so x = t^3.

Then, equation becomes:

-sqrt(3) t^3 + sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - t^2)^(3/2).

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a value of t that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate the exponent.

Let me write it as:

[ -sqrt(3) t^3 + sqrt(3)/2 ]^2 = [ (1 - t^2)^(3/2) ]^2.

Which simplifies to:

(3 t^6 - 3 t^3 + 3/4) = (1 - t^2)^3.

Wait, let me compute the left side:

Left side: [ -sqrt(3) t^3 + sqrt(3)/2 ]^2

= (sqrt(3))^2 [ (-t^3 + 1/2) ]^2

= 3 [ t^6 - t^3 + 1/4 ]

= 3t^6 - 3t^3 + 3/4.

Right side: (1 - t^2)^3 = 1 - 3t^2 + 3t^4 - t^6.

So, set equal:

3t^6 - 3t^3 + 3/4 = 1 - 3t^2 + 3t^4 - t^6.

Bring all terms to left side:

3t^6 -3t^3 +3/4 -1 +3t^2 -3t^4 +t^6=0.

Combine like terms:

(3t^6 + t^6) + (-3t^4) + (3t^2) + (-3t^3) + (3/4 -1)=0.

So,

4t^6 -3t^4 +3t^2 -3t^3 -1/4 =0.

So, 4t^6 -3t^4 +3t^2 -3t^3 -1/4 =0.

This is a sixth-degree equation, which looks complicated. Maybe we can
