Alright, so I've got this problem where I'm supposed to find the smallest integer base b (b ≥ 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if when written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, in base b, a two-digit number would be something like "ab" where a is the first digit and b is the second digit. But wait, actually, in programming terms, it's more like the number is a * b + c, where a is the first digit (the b's place) and c is the second digit (the units place). So, n = a * b + c. But both a and c have to be digits in base b, meaning they have to be less than b. So, a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The condition is that a + c equals sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. Let me note that: n = k^2, where k is an integer, and k = a + c.

So, putting it together: k = a + c, and n = a * b + c. But n is also k^2, so:

k^2 = a * b + c.

But since c = k - a, substituting that in:

k^2 = a * b + (k - a).

Simplify that:

k^2 = a * b + k - a.

Let's rearrange terms:

a * b - a = k^2 - k.

Factor a out from the left side:

a (b - 1) = k^2 - k.

So, a = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1).

But remember that a must be a positive integer because it's the leading digit. So, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and a has to be between 1 and b-1.

Also, since c = k - a, and c must be a valid digit in base b (i.e., 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1), we have constraints on k:

From c ≥ 0: k - a ≥ 0 → a ≤ k.

From c < b: k - a ≤ b - 1 → a ≥ k - (b -1).

So combining these, a must satisfy:

k - (b - 1) ≤ a ≤ k.

But since a is also ≥1 and ≤ b-1, the overall constraints are:

max(1, k - (b -1)) ≤ a ≤ min(k, b -1).

Also, since a must be positive, k must be at least a, so k ≥ a.

Now, since a is expressed as (k^2 - k)/(b -1), let's write that down:

a = [k(k - 1)] / (b -1).

Since a must be an integer, (b -1) must divide k(k -1). So, (b -1) | k(k -1).

Also, since a ≤ b -1, [k(k -1)] / (b -1) ≤ b -1.

Which implies:

k(k -1) ≤ (b -1)^2.

So, k(k -1) ≤ (b -1)^2.

Hmm, so for each base b, we can look for integers k such that (b -1) divides k(k-1), and that k(k -1) ≤ (b -1)^2.

Moreover, since a must be positive, k(k -1) must be positive, so k ≥ 2.

So, for each b, we need to find all k ≥ 2 such that:

1. (b -1) divides k(k -1).

2. k(k -1) ≤ (b -1)^2.

3. Then, a = [k(k -1)] / (b -1) must also be ≤ b -1, which is already implied by condition 2.

4. Also, c = k - a must be ≥0 and ≤ b -1.

So, let's think about how to approach this. For each base b, we can consider possible k's and see if they satisfy the conditions.

But the problem is asking for the least b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, meaning more than ten such k's for that b.

So, perhaps we can model the number of solutions k for each b. Let's try to find an expression for the number of possible k's given b.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize in terms of k and (b -1). Since (b -1) must divide k(k -1), which are two consecutive integers, so their GCD is 1. Therefore, (b -1) must divide either k or k -1, but not both, since they're coprime.

Wait, that's a key point. Because k and k-1 are coprime, any divisor of their product that is coprime to one must divide the other.

Therefore, since (b -1) divides k(k -1), and since (k, k -1) = 1, (b -1) must be a product of factors where each factor is either in k or in k -1.

But given that (b -1) is fixed for a given base, we can think that (b -1) can be broken down into d and e, where d divides k and e divides k -1, and d*e = b -1.

So, for each divisor pair (d, e) of (b -1) such that d*e = b -1, we can set k = d * m, and k -1 = e * n, where m and n are positive integers. But since k = d*m and k -1 = e*n, we have:

d*m - e*n = 1.

This is a Diophantine equation. The solutions to this equation will give possible k's for each pair (d, e).

But perhaps this is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe a better approach is to, for each k, determine all possible b's that satisfy the conditions.

Wait, perhaps let's consider that for a given k, (b -1
