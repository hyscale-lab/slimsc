Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner. The catch is that each path must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, to get from one corner to the other, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because the path length is 16.

Now, the problem is about counting the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Changing direction means switching from moving right to up or from up to right. So, each time the path switches direction, it's a change. 

Wait, let me think about how direction changes work. If I'm moving only right and up, each time I switch from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if I alternate right and up, each step would be a direction change. But in our case, we need exactly four direction changes. So, how does that translate to the number of segments or straight lines in the path?

Hmm, maybe I can model this as the number of runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. So, each time the direction changes, a new run starts. So, if there are four direction changes, that means the path has five runs. Because each direction change adds a new run. For example, starting with right, then up, that's two runs and one direction change.

Right, so if there are four direction changes, there are five runs. So, the path consists of five straight segments, alternating between right and up. Now, since the grid is 8x8, the total right moves must sum to 8, and the total up moves must also sum to 8.

So, each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up steps. Let's say the first run is right, then up, then right, etc., depending on how the direction changes. Since we have five runs, and they alternate between right and up, the number of runs in each direction depends on whether five is odd or even. Five is odd, so there will be three runs in one direction and two in the other. Because starting with right, the runs would be right, up, right, up, right. So, three right runs and two up runs.

Wait, is that right? Let me count. Starting with right: run 1 (right), run 2 (up), run 3 (right), run 4 (up), run 5 (right). So, three right runs and two up runs. Alternatively, if it starts with up, then it would be three up runs and two right runs. But since the path starts at the lower left and ends at the upper right, it must start with a right move or an up move.

Wait, actually, no. The first move could be either right or up. So, the starting direction can be either right or up. So, the number of runs can be either three right and two up, or three up and two right. 

So, in total, the path can have two cases: starting with right and having three right runs, or starting with up and having three up runs. Each case will contribute to the total number of paths, so I need to calculate both cases and add them together.

Let me formalize this. Let's consider the case where the path starts with a right move. Then, as I thought, there are three right runs and two up runs. The total number of right steps is 8, so these three runs must sum to 8. Similarly, the up runs must sum to 8, and there are two such runs.

Similarly, if the path starts with an up move, then there are three up runs and two right runs. The same logic applies.

So, for each case, I can model this as a stars and bars problem. The number of ways to distribute 8 right moves into 3 runs
