Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, starting from the lower left corner and ending at the upper right corner. The condition is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite, you typically move right and up. For an 8x8 grid, that means moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order.

But the problem isn't just about any path; it's about paths that change direction exactly four times. Wait, what does that mean exactly? So, a direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. For example, if a path goes R R U U R, that's two direction changes: after the first two R's, it changes to U, then after the two U's, it changes back to R.

So, each time the path switches from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change. So, exactly four direction changes mean the path alternates between R and U segments exactly four times. Wait, but how does that translate into the number of segments?

Hmm, let's think. Each direction change adds a new segment. So, starting with either R or U, each change adds another segment. So, for four direction changes, how many segments is that?

Wait, if you have four direction changes, that means the path is divided into five segments. For example, starting with R, then U, then R, then U, then R: that's four changes, resulting in five segments. Alternatively, starting with U, then R, then U, then R, then U: also four changes, five segments.

So, regardless of starting direction, four changes lead to five segments. Now, each segment must consist of at least one step. Because you can't have a segment with zero steps; that would mean no movement in that direction, which doesn't make sense.

So, the problem now becomes: how many sequences of R's and U's with eight R's and eight U's, divided into five segments, with each segment consisting of at least one R or U, and the direction alternating each time.
