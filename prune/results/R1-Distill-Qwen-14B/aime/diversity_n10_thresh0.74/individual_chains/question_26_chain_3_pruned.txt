Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let's see what it says. Triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C meet at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. The sides are given: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, triangle with sides 5, 9, 10. I should maybe compute some properties of this triangle first, like its angles or maybe the radius of the circumcircle ω.

Wait, since the triangle is inscribed in the circle, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. So, the tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something? Or maybe D is the exsimilicenter? Hmm, not sure. But tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC, since both are tangents from D to ω.

Right, so D lies on the external angle bisector of angle BAC or something? Hmm, not exactly sure, but maybe I can use some properties of tangents here.

Let me think about the power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D is equal to DB² = DC². Also, the power can be expressed as DA * DP, since AD passes through the circle and intersects it at A and P. So, power of D is DA * DP = DB².

So, if I can find DA and DB, I can find DP, and then AP = AD - DP, or maybe the other way around. Wait, actually, point P is the second intersection point of AD with ω, so AP is the segment from A to P, which is part of AD. So, AP is the length from A to P, which is AD minus DP or something? Wait, no, because from A, going towards D, you hit P first, then go on to D. So AP is the segment from A to P, which is shorter than AD. So, AP = AD - DP? Or is it DP = AD - AP? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

AD is the entire length from A to D. Then, since P is between A and D, AP is part of AD. So, AP + PD = AD. So, PD = AD - AP. But from power of point, DA * DP = DB². So, DA * (AD - AP) = DB².

Hmm, but that might get complicated. Maybe I should find the lengths of DA and DB first.

Alternatively, I can use coordinate geometry. Maybe assign coordinates to the triangle ABC and compute everything accordingly. Let me try that.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A on the x-axis at (10,0), since AC is 10 units.
