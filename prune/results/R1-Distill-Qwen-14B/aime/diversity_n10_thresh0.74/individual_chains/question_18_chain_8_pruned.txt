Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, I think. But maybe I don't need that right away.

The question is about rectangles. So, a rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. But in the context of the dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle have to lie on either the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle can't be arbitrary lines; they have to coincide with existing edges or diagonals.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a high number of sides like a dodecagon, there are various diagonals of different lengths. Each diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices. The length of the diagonals depends on how many vertices apart they are.

Wait, for a regular polygon, the number of diagonals is n(n - 3)/2, where n is the number of sides. So for a dodecagon, that would be 12 * 9 / 2 = 54 diagonals. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

But maybe I should think about how to form a rectangle. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides are all parallel in specific directions, and diagonals can also be parallel if they are spaced equally apart.

So, perhaps the key is to find sets of four points in the dodecagon that form a rectangle. Each rectangle will be determined by two pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) intersecting at right angles.

Let me think about the symmetry. A regular dodecagon has 12-fold rotational symmetry and reflectional symmetry along multiple axes. So, maybe the number of rectangles can be calculated by considering the different possible directions of sides and diagonals and how they can intersect at right angles.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the same length, but diagonals vary. So, the sides of the rectangle could be sides of the dodecagon or diagonals of various lengths. But for it to be a rectangle, the sides need to be at right angles.

Wait a minute, in a regular dodecagon, the sides are separated by 30-degree angles (since 360/12 = 30). So, each vertex is 30 degrees apart around the center.

Now, for two lines to be perpendicular, the angle between them should be 90 degrees. So, perhaps in terms of steps between vertices, the angle they make at the center would relate to their positions.

Let me consider two lines that are perpendicular. If one line is a side (which connects adjacent vertices), the other line would have to be a diagonal that is at 90 degrees relative to it. But each side is at 30 degrees from the center, so maybe the
