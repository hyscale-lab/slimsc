Okay, so I've got this problem about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem involving geometry and algebra. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume V is lwh. So, in this problem, we're given S = 54 and V = 23.

The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2 = sqrt(l² + w² + h²)/2. Therefore, r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4. So, to minimize r, we need to minimize l² + w² + h² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing l² + w² + h² with the constraints:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

I think I can approach this using Lagrange multipliers, which is a method for finding the extrema of a function subject to constraints. Alternatively, maybe using AM-GM inequalities or some substitution method. Let me see.

Let me denote S = l² + w² + h², which we need to minimize. The constraints are:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 => lw + lh + wh = 27
and
lwh = 23

I wonder if there's a way to relate S, the sum of squares, to the sum of the products. I recall that (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² + 2(lw + lh + wh), so that gives S = (l + w + h)² - 2(lw + lh + wh). We know lw + lh + wh is 27, so S = (l + w + h)² - 54.

But I don't know l + w + h yet. Maybe I can express this in terms of other variables or use another relation. Since lwh = 23, perhaps I can let x = l, y = w, z = h, so xyz = 23, and xy + xz + yz = 27. I need to minimize x² + y² + z².

Alternatively, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using the volume equation and substitute into the surface area equation, then express S in terms of two variables, and then find the minimum. Let's try that.

Let me solve for h from the volume equation: h = 23/(lw). Then substitute h into the surface area equation:

2(lw + l*(23/(lw)) + w*(23/(lw))) = 54

Simplify:

2(lw + (23)/(w) + (23)/(l)) = 54

Divide both sides by 2:

lw + (23/w) + (23/l) = 27

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe manageable. Let me denote u = l and v = w, so that h = 23/(uv). Then:

uv + 23/v + 23/u = 27

Hmm, I'm not sure if that's the best way. Maybe it's better to consider symmetry or make some substitutions.

Wait, perhaps I can set l = w = x and then see what h would be. If I can assume that the minimal sphere
