Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, so I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ +1, and then find the smallest m for that p such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

First, I think I should figure out what primes p satisfy that condition. Maybe it's a specific prime that I need to test.

I remember that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ +1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. That means the order of n modulo p divides 8 because (n⁴)² ≡ 1 mod p, so the multiplicative order of n modulo p must divide 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1, the order can't be 4, because that would give n⁴ ≡ 1 mod p. So the order must be 8.

Therefore, 8 must divide p-1, because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, so 8 divides p-1. So p must be 1 mod 8.

Wait, but what about primes where -1 is a quartic residue? So primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8 will have elements of order 8, hence n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p is possible.

But the problem is about p² dividing n⁴ +1. So not only does p divide n⁴ +1, but p² also does.

I think that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8, it's possible for p to divide n⁴ +1, but when does p² divide n⁴ +1?

I remember from number theory that for an odd prime p, if p divides n^k +1, then p² divides n^k +1 only under certain conditions. Specifically, if n is a primitive root modulo p, then under some conditions, higher powers might divide.

Wait, maybe I should recall Hensel's lemma or lifting the exponent. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the multiplicative order.

So, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p is 8. Then, for p² to divide n⁴ +1, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p².

But we need to check if 8 is the order of n modulo p² or not.

Wait, maybe I should think about the multiplicative group modulo p². The multiplicative group is cyclic only for p=2, right? For odd primes, it's cyclic if p is odd and the group is of order p(p-1). Wait, actually, no. The multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic only when p is an odd prime, because the group is cyclic when the order is a product of two coprimes. Wait, I think the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic for any prime p, including p=2. Let me double-check.

Wait, the multiplicative group modulo p^k is cyclic if p is an odd prime, and for p=2, it's cyclic only when k ≤ 2. Since 2^3=8, and the multiplicative group mod 8 is not cyclic, so for p=2, it's cyclic only mod 2 and 4.

So for odd primes p, the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic. Therefore, the group has order p(p-1). So if n has order 8 mod p, then what is its order mod p²?

If n has order 8 mod p, then when we lift it to mod p², the order can be 8 or 8p or some multiple. Wait, but actually, the multiplicative order modulo p² might be a multiple of the order modulo p.

Wait, I think there's a theorem about this. If the order of n modulo p is d, then the order modulo p² is d or d*p, depending on whether n^d ≡ 1 mod p².

So in our case, if n has order 8 mod p, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. For mod p², we can check whether n^8 ≡ 1 mod p² or not.

If n^8 ≡ 1 mod p², then the order of n modulo p² is 8. Otherwise, the order is 8p.

But if the order is 8, then n^4 ≡ -1 mod p², which is exactly what we want. So we need that n^8 ≡ 1 mod p² but n^4 ≡ -1 mod p².

So, for primes p ≡1 mod 8, n^4 ≡ -1 mod p. Then, we can check whether n^4 ≡ -1 mod p² or not.

If n^4 ≡ -1 mod p², then p² divides n^4 +1, which is what we need.

But when does n^4 ≡ -1 mod p²? Maybe only for specific primes.

I think the primes p for which there exists an integer n with n^4 ≡ -1 mod p² are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8, and additionally, p does not divide the class number of Q(i). Wait, that's getting a bit advanced for me.

Alternatively, perhaps I should test small primes p ≡1 mod 8 and see whether there exists n where n^4 +1 is divisible by p².

So primes ≡1 mod 8 are 17, 97, 113, etc. Wait, 17 is the smallest prime ≡1 mod 8 after 2, which is ≡2 mod 8.

Wait, let's list primes ≡1 mod 8:

17, 97, 113, 193, 241, 257,...

So maybe p=17 is the smallest such prime.

But let's check for p=17.

We need to find if there exists n such that n^4 ≡-1 mod 17²=289.

First, let's find if there are solutions to n^4 ≡-1 mod 17.

Since 17≡1 mod 8, -1 is a quartic residue mod 17. Let's find such n.

We can test n=2: 2^4=16≡-1 mod17. So n=2 is a solution mod17.

Now, can we lift this solution to mod 289?

We can use Hensel's lemma, which says that if f(n)=n^4 +1, and f'(n) is not zero mod p, then the solution can be lifted uniquely.

Compute f'(n)=4n^3.

At n=2, f'(2)=4*8=32. 32 mod17 is 15, which is not zero mod17. So Hensel's lemma applies, and there exists a unique lift of n=2 mod17 to a solution mod289.

Therefore, there exists an n such that n^4 ≡-1 mod289, so 17² divides n^4 +1. So p=17 is a candidate.

Now, is 17 the smallest such prime?

Wait, the primes less than 17 are 2,3,5,7,11,13. Let's check if any of them can have p² dividing n^4 +1 for some n.

Starting with p=2: Let's check n^4 +1 mod4.

n can be 0,1,2,3 mod4.

n=0: 0+1=1 mod4. Not 0.

n=1:1+1=2 mod4. Not 0.

n=2:16+1=17≡1 mod4.

n=3:81+1=82≡2 mod4.

So mod4, n^4 +1 is either 1 or 2, never 0. So 4 doesn't divide n^4 +1 for any n. So p=2 is out.

p=3: Let's see n^4 +1 mod9.

Compute n^4 mod9:

n=0:0

n=1:1

n=2:16≡7

n=3:81≡0

n=4:256≡4

n=5:625≡4

n=6:1296≡0

n=7:2401≡4

n=8:4096≡7

So n^4 mod9 can be 0,1,4,7.

Adding 1: n^4 +1 mod9 can be 1,2,5,8. None are 0. So 9 doesn't divide n^4 +1.

p=3 is out.

p=5: Check if 25 divides n^4 +1.

Compute n^4 mod25.

n from 0 to24:

But maybe it's easier to compute n^4 mod5 first.

n=0:0

n=1:1

n=2:16≡1

n=3:81≡1

n=4:256≡1

So mod5, n^4 is 0 or1. So n^4 +1 mod5 is 1 or 2. So mod5, n^4 +1 can never be 0. So 5 doesn't divide n^4 +1 because n^4 ≡0 or1 mod5, so n^4 +1≡1 or2 mod5. Thus, p=5 is out.

p=7: Let's see if 49 divides n^4 +1.

First, check if 7 divides n^4 +1.

n^4 mod7:

n=0:0

n=1:1

n=2:16≡2

n=3:81≡4

n=4:256≡4

n=5:625≡2

n=6:1296≡1

So n^4 mod7 can be 0,1,2,4.

Thus, n^4 +1 mod7 can be 1,2,3,5. So 7 divides n^4 +1 only if n^4≡-1 mod7. But in mod7, possible residues are 0,1,2,4. So -1 mod7 is 6, which is not among the residues. So 7 doesn't divide n^4 +1 for any n. So p=7 is out.

p=11: Check if 121 divides n^4 +1.

First, check if 11 divides n^4 +1.

n^4 mod11:

n=0:0

n=1:1

n=2:16≡5

n=3:81≡4

n=4:256≡3

n=5:625≡9

n=6:1296≡1296-117*11=1296-1287=9

Wait, 6^4=1296. 1296 /11 is 117*11=1287, remainder 9.

n=6:9

n=7:7^4=2401. 2401 mod11: 2401-218*11=2401-2398=3.

n=8:8^4=4096. 4096 mod11: 4096-372*11=4096-4092=4.

n=9:9^4=6561. 6561 mod11: 6561-596*11=6561-6556=5.

n=10:10^4=10000. 10000 mod11: 10000-909*11=10000-9999=1.

So n^4 mod11 gives residues 0,1,3,4,5,9. So n^4 +1 mod11 can be 1,2,4,5,6,10. So 11 doesn't divide n^4 +1 for any n. So p=11 is out.

p=13: Check if 13 divides n^4 +1.

Compute n^4 mod13.

n=0:0

n=1:1

n=2:16≡3

n=3:81≡3

n=4:256≡9

n=5:625≡625-48*13=625-624=1

n=6:6^4=1296. 1296 mod13: 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9.

n=7:7^4=2401. 2401 mod13: 2401-184*13=2401-2392=9.

n=8:8^4=4096. 4096 mod13: Let's see, 13*315=4095, so 4096≡1 mod13.

n=9:9^4=6561. 6561 mod13: 6561-504*13=6561-6552=9.

n=10:10^4=10000. 10000 mod13: 13*769=9997, so 10000-9997=3.

n=11:11^4=14641. 14641 mod13: Let's compute 11 mod13 is -2. So (-2)^4=16≡3 mod13.

n=12:12^4=(-1)^4=1 mod13.

So the residues are 0,1,3,9.

So n^4 +1 mod13 can be 1,2,4,10. So 13 doesn't divide n^4 +1 for any n. So p=13 is out.

So the next prime is p=17, which we saw earlier. So p=17 is the least prime where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Now, the question is to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p²=289.

We need the smallest m such that m⁴ ≡ -1 mod289.

Earlier, we saw that mod17, n=2 is a solution because 2^4=16≡-1 mod17. So we can try to lift this solution to mod289 using Hensel's lemma.

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n)=n^4 +1, and f'(n) is not ≡0 mod p, then the solution can be uniquely lifted.

f'(n)=4n³.

At n=2, f'(2)=4*8=32. 32 mod17 is 15≡-2 mod17, which is not zero.

So we can lift the solution. Let's find m ≡2 mod17 such that m^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Let m=2 +17k, where k is an integer to be determined.

Compute m^4 = (2 +17k)^4.

Expanding this using the binomial theorem:

=2^4 + 4*(2^3)*(17k) + 6*(2^2)*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But since we're working mod289=17², any term with 17² or higher power will be 0 mod289.

So we can ignore terms beyond the second term.

So m^4 ≈2^4 + 4*(8)*(17k) mod289.

Compute:

2^4=16.

4*8=32. 32*(17k)=32*17k=544k.

Now, 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So 544k ≡255k mod289.

Thus, m^4 ≈16 +255k mod289.

We want m^4 ≡-1 mod289. So:

16 +255k ≡-1 mod289.

So 255k ≡-17 mod289.

Simplify this equation.

First, 255 and 289: Let's compute GCD(255,289).

289 ÷255=1 with remainder 34.

255 ÷34=7 with remainder 17.

34 ÷17=2 with remainder 0. So GCD is17.

But -17 mod289 is 272.

So the equation is 255k ≡272 mod289.

Since GCD(255,289)=17, we can divide both sides by 17:

255/17=15, 272/17=16, 289/17=17.

So equation becomes 15k ≡16 mod17.

15 mod17 is 15, 16 mod17 is16.

So 15k ≡16 mod17.

We can find the inverse of15 mod17. 15≡-2 mod17, so inverse of -2 is the number x where (-2)x≡1 mod17.

Testing x=9: (-2)*9=-18≡-18+34=16≡-1 mod17. Not 1.

x=8: (-2)*8=-16≡1 mod17. Yes, because -16 +17=1.

So inverse of15 is8 mod17.

Thus, k≡16*8 mod17.

16*8=128.

128 mod17: 17*7=119, 128-119=9.

So k≡9 mod17.

So k=9 +17t, where t is integer.

Thus, m=2 +17k=2 +17*(9 +17t)=2 +153 +289t=155 +289t.

We need the smallest positive m, so t=0 gives m=155.

But is 155 the minimal solution?

Wait, let's check m=155.

Compute 155^4 mod289. Let's see.

Alternatively, compute 155 mod17: 155 ÷17=9*17=153, so 155≡2 mod17, as expected.

Compute (2 +17*9)^4.

But as we computed earlier, m=2+17k=2+153=155.

But let me compute 155^4 mod289.

Alternatively, compute (2 +17*9)^4 mod289.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 155^4 mod289.

But 155 is 155. Let me compute 155^2 first.

155^2=24025.

Compute 24025 mod289.

289*83=289*(80+3)=289*80=23120, 289*3=867. So 23120+867=23987.

24025 -23987=38.

So 155^2 ≡38 mod289.

Now compute 38^2=1444.

1444 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1444-1156=288≡-1 mod289.

So 155^4=(155^2)^2≡38^2≡-1 mod289. Which is exactly what we wanted.

So m=155 is the solution mod289, and it's the smallest positive integer solution.

But wait, is there a smaller positive integer than 155 that satisfies m^4≡-1 mod289?

Because mod289, the solutions to m^4≡-1 would be 155 and 289-155=134. Let's check if 134 is a solution.

Compute 134 mod17:134 ÷17=7*17=119, 134-119=15. So 134≡15 mod17.

But 15^4 mod17:15≡-2, so (-2)^4=16≡-1 mod17. So 134 is also a solution mod17. Let's check mod289.

Compute 134^4 mod289.

Compute 134^2: 134*134=17,956.

17,956 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 goes into 17,956.

289*60=17,340.

17,956-17,340=616.

616 ÷289=2*289=578.

616-578=38.

So 134^2≡38 mod289.

Then, 38^2=1444≡-1 mod289 as before.

So 134^4=(134^2)^2≡38^2≡-1 mod289.

So both 134 and155 are solutions.

But since 134 <155, 134 is a smaller solution.

Wait, that's a problem. Because when I solved for k, I got k≡9 mod17, so k=9 +17t, which gave m=2+17k=2+153=155 when t=0. But 134 is also a solution.

How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I missed a solution when I lifted. Maybe there are two solutions mod289.

Wait, because the multiplicative group mod289 is cyclic, and the equation x^4 ≡-1 would have solutions if the order of -1 divides (group order)/2.

Wait, the multiplicative group mod289 has order 289-1=288. So the equation x^4 ≡-1 implies that x^8 ≡1 mod289.

So the order of x must divide 8 and also divide 288. Since 288=2^5 *3^2, the order can be 8, but 8 divides 288.

So the equation x^8≡1 mod289 would have φ(8)=4 solutions. So x^4≡-1 mod289 would have two solutions, since x^4≡-1 implies x^8≡1, and each solution to x^8≡1 that isn't a solution to x^4≡1 would be a solution to x^4≡-1.

So indeed, there are two solutions: m=134 and m=155.

So the minimal positive integer m is 134, since 134<155.

But wait, when I used Hensel's lemma, I started with n=2 mod17, which lifted to m=155 mod289. But since the multiplicative group is cyclic, there should be another solution starting from another root mod17.

Wait, in mod17, the solutions to x^4≡-1 are x=2 and x=15, since 2^4=16≡-1, and 15= -2 mod17, so (-2)^4=16≡-1.

So perhaps starting with n=15 mod17, which is 15, we can lift it to mod289 to get another solution.

Let me try that.

Let m=15 +17k.

Compute m^4 mod289.

Similarly to earlier:

m=15 +17k.

Compute m^4: (15 +17k)^4.

Again, expand up to the linear term in k:

=15^4 + 4*(15^3)*(17k) mod289.

15^4: Let's compute 15^2=225; 225^2=50625.

50625 mod289: Let's compute 289*175=289*(100+75)=28900 +21675=50575.

50625 -50575=50.

So 15^4≡50 mod289.

Then, 4*(15^3)*(17k):

15^3=3375. 3375 mod289: 289*11=3179, 3375-3179=196.

So 15^3≡196 mod289.

Then, 4*196=784. 784 mod289: 289*2=578, 784-578=206.

So 4*15^3≡206 mod289.

Multiply by17k: 206*17k=3502k.

3502 mod289: 289*12=3468. 3502-3468=34.

So 3502k≡34k mod289.

Thus, m^4 ≈50 +34k mod289.

We set this ≡-1 mod289: 50 +34k ≡288 mod289.

So, 34k ≡288 -50=238 mod289.

Thus, 34k ≡238 mod289.

Simplify: Divide both sides by GCD(34,289). GCD(34,289)=17.

So, 34/17=2, 238/17=14, 289/17=17.

So equation becomes 2k≡14 mod17.

2k≡14 mod17. Multiply both sides by inverse of2 mod17. The inverse of2 is9, since2*9=18≡1 mod17.

Thus, k≡14*9=126≡126-7*17=126-119=7 mod17.

So k=7 +17t.

Thus, m=15 +17k=15 +17*7=15 +119=134.

So m=134 is the other solution, and it's smaller than155.

So the minimal positive integer m is134.

Wait, but earlier when I started with n=2 mod17, I got m=155, and starting with n=15 mod17, I got m=134.

So the minimal m is134.

Therefore, the answer is134.

Wait, but is there a smaller positive m than134? Let me check m=134-289= negative, so no. So 134 is indeed the minimal positive integer.

So the answer is134.


To solve the problem, we need to find the least prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \), and then determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step 1: Identifying the Prime \( p \)
We start by noting that if \( p \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \), then \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \). This implies that the multiplicative order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) is 8, meaning \( 8 \) divides \( p - 1 \). Therefore, \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).

The smallest prime \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \) is 17. We verify that \( 17^2 = 289 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Since \( 2^4 = 16 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \), we can lift this solution to modulo \( 289 \) using Hensel's lemma.

### Step 2: Lifting the Solution to Modulo \( 289 \)
We seek \( m \) such that \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \) and \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{289} \). Let \( m = 2 + 17k \). Expanding \( m^4 \) modulo \( 289 \) and solving for \( k \), we find \( k = 9 \). Thus, \( m = 2 + 17 \times 9 = 155 \).

However, there is another solution starting with \( n = 15 \pmod{17} \), which lifts to \( m = 134 \) modulo \( 289 \). Since \( 134 < 155 \), the smallest positive integer \( m \) is 134.

### Final Answer
The least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \( \boxed{134} \).
