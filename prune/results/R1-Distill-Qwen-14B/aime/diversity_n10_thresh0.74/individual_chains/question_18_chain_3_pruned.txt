Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. The problem says that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle are either edges of the dodecagon or diagonals connecting non-adjacent vertices.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, it's also convex, meaning all the vertices point outward, and no sides cross each other.

Now, the problem is about forming rectangles. A rectangle has four sides with four right angles. In the context of a regular dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must lie along the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the vertices of the rectangle must be vertices of the dodecagon as well because the sides and diagonals connect vertices.

Wait, no, actually, the sides of the rectangle lie on the sides or diagonals. But the sides of the dodecagon are edges between two vertices, and the diagonals connect non-adjacent vertices. So, each side of the rectangle must be a side of the dodecagon or a diagonal, which suggests that the rectangle's sides are formed by these edges or diagonals.

But rectangles are quadrilaterals with four right angles. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals have specific lengths and angles between them. So, for a rectangle to be formed, the sides must meet at right angles.

I think the key here is to figure out how to select four vertices of the dodecagon such that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and the angles between them are 90 degrees.

In a regular polygon, the central angles between vertices can help determine the lengths of sides and diagonals. For a dodecagon, the central angle between adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, each side corresponds to a 30-degree arc on the circumscribed circle.

Now, for a rectangle to be formed, the sides must meet at 90 degrees. So, the vectors representing the sides of the rectangle must be perpendicular. Since the regular dodecagon is inscribed in a circle, the vectors from the center to the vertices are all of equal length and separated by 30 degrees.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the coordinates of the vertices. If I label the dodecagon vertices as V0, V1, V2, ..., V11, each vertex can be represented in the complex plane as e^(2πik/12), where k is 0 to 11. So, each vertex has coordinates (cos θ, sin θ), where θ = 30°*k.

So, the idea is to pick four points such that the sides between them are either sides (1 step apart) or diagonals (more steps apart) and the angles between the sides are 90 degrees.

Alternatively, in terms of vectors, if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, if I have two vectors from the center to two points, say V_i and V_j, their dot product is |V_i||V_j|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. Since all |V_i| are equal (they're on the unit circle), the dot product is zero when cosθ = 0, which happens when θ = 90° or 270°, i.e., when the angle between the points is a quarter-circle apart.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the angle between two vertices is 30°*k, where k is the number of steps between them. So, if two vectors are separated by 3 steps, that's 90°, right? Because 3*30=90. So, two vectors separated by 3 steps are perpendicular.

Therefore, perhaps for a rectangle to exist, the four points must be such that the sides correspond to steps that are perpendicular, i.e., one side is a step of m, another is a step of n, and m and n must be such that their corresponding angles are perpendicular. So, m*30 and n*30 must differ by 90°, so m*30 - n*30 = 90°, so m - n = 3. Hmm, but that would be the case if it's a square, but maybe more generally, for a rectangle, the sides can be of different lengths, as long as the corresponding angles between the edges are 90 degrees.

Wait, but in the dodecagon, the angle between two edges (sides or diagonals) depends on how many sides apart they are. For a rectangle, the sides must meet at 90 degrees, so the corresponding central angles must differ by 90 degrees
