Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p over q, where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I know that a rectangular box has length, width, and height, right? Let me denote them as x, y, z. So, the surface area S of such a box is given by the formula:

S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54.

And the volume V is:

V = xyz = 23.

So, we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27.
2. xyz = 23.

Our goal is to find the minimal radius of a sphere that can contain this box. The sphere's radius must be at least half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere needs to enclose the entire box. The space diagonal d of the box is given by:

d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²).

Therefore, the radius r is d/2, so r² = (d²)/4 = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, to find r², I need to find x² + y² + z², and then divide by 4. So, the key here is to find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on the surface area and volume.

Wait, hold on. But the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B." So, I think we need to find the maximum possible x² + y² + z² because the sphere must contain any box in B, so the radius must be at least the maximum possible space diagonal divided by 2. So, actually, I think I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given the surface area and volume constraints. Because if multiple boxes exist with different space diagonals, the sphere must be big enough to contain the one with the largest diagonal.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The set B consists of all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. For each such box, we can compute the radius of the minimal enclosing sphere, which is half the space diagonal of that box. The problem is asking for the radius r that works for all boxes in B, meaning the maximal minimal radius across all boxes in B. So, r will be the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B divided by 2. Therefore, to compute r, I need to find the maximum of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) for all x, y, z satisfying the given constraints.

Alternatively, since sqrt is an increasing function, it's equivalent to maximizing x² + y² + z². So, our problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² given that:

xy + yz + zx = 27,

and xyz = 23.

So, how do we maximize x² + y² + z² under these constraints?

I remember that for such optimization problems, we can use methods like Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a way to relate x² + y² + z² with the given expressions using known inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of (x + y + z)^2 and the given expressions.

Yes, because (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx).

We know that xy + yz + zx = 27, so:

(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 54.

Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, if we can find x + y + z, then we can compute x² + y² + z².

But we don't have x + y + z directly, but we do know xyz = 23.

Hmm. So, perhaps we can relate x + y + z with the given constraints.

Wait, another idea: perhaps we can consider variables x, y, z in terms of the roots of a cubic equation. Let me think. If x, y, z are the roots of t^3 - at^2 + bt - c = 0, then a = x + y + z, b = xy + yz + zx, and c = xyz.

In our case, b = 27 and c = 23. So, the cubic would be t^3 - at^2 + 27t -23 = 0.

So, perhaps we can find a such that this cubic has three positive real roots, and then find the maximum of x² + y² + z², which is a^2 - 54.

But I'm not sure how to find a so that the cubic has positive real roots. Alternatively, maybe we can use some inequalities.

Wait, another thought: for positive real numbers x, y, z, we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality.

We know that the arithmetic mean of x, y, z is (x + y + z)/3, and the geometric mean is (xyz)^(1/3) = 23^(1/3). So, AM ≥ GM, so (x + y + z)/3 ≥ 23^(1/3). Therefore, x + y + z ≥ 3 * 23^(1/3). But that gives a lower bound, not an upper bound.

But we need to find the maximum of x + y + z, or perhaps the maximum of x² + y² + z².

Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + zx = 27 and h(x,y,z) = xyz = 23.

So, setting up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz -23).

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0,

∂L/∂y =
