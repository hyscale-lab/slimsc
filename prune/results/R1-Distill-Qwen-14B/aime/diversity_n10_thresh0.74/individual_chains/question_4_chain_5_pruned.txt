Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, starting with Alice, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about this. It's a turn-based game with two possible moves each turn: take 1 or 4 tokens. The goal is to take the last token, so it's a classic combinatorial game. I remember these usually involve figuring out winning and losing positions.

A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite: no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, then Bob can win. So I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position.

Let me try to model this. Let's list the possible positions and see if we can find a pattern.

Starting from n=1: Alice takes 1, wins. So n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last token. So Alice would lose. But wait, can Alice take all 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, but Bob can take that and win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So n=2: Bob can win if Alice goes first. Wait, but in this case, Alice is the one who can't force a win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who can then take it and win. Or take 4, but she can't because there are only 2 tokens. So Alice's only move is to take 1. Then Bob takes the last token and wins. So for n=2, Alice can't win, so it's a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So
