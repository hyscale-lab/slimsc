Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that turns all blue vertices into positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to unpack this. First, a regular octagon has eight sides, so it has eight vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's the denominator of the probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there's a rotation that maps each blue vertex to a position that was originally red. Wait, that might not be the exact phrasing. Let me re-read the problem.

"The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices."

So, the idea is that after some rotation, every blue vertex moves to a spot that was red before the rotation. Hmm. Alternatively, it's saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you rotate the octagon so that all blue vertices align with red ones, that would mean the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but since each vertex is colored either red or blue, the set of red vertices and blue vertices are complementary. So, if the blue vertices can be rotated to align with red vertices, that would mean the blue set is congruent to the red set under some rotation. But since they are complements, that would imply that the blue set is a rotation of itself, which is only possible if the blue set is symmetric in a certain way.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about group theory. The octagon's symmetries form the dihedral group D8, which includes rotations and reflections. But the problem is only considering rotations, not reflections. So, the rotation group is cyclic of order 8.

We need colorings where the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since red and blue are complements, this would mean that the blue set is a rotation of the red set, which is the same as saying that the blue set is a rotation of its own complement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the coloring is such that when you rotate the octagon by some multiple of 45 degrees (since it's regular), all blue vertices move to red positions, and vice versa. Wait, no, it's not vice versa, because blue is moving to red positions. So, perhaps the blue set is mapped exactly onto the red set under that rotation.

Wait, but the blue set is being mapped to the red set, which is its complement. So, the blue set is being rotated to the red set, which is the same as saying that the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

But since the blue set is the complement of the red set, this would imply that the blue set is a rotated version of its own complement. So, for the blue set to satisfy that, it must have rotational symmetry such that rotating it by some angle maps it to its complement.

Alternatively, perhaps the set of blue vertices is a union of orbits under some rotation. Wait,
