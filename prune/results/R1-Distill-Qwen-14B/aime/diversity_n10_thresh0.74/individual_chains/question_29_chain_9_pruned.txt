Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because without a clear picture, I might get lost.

Alright, the problem mentions two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. So, I imagine rectangle ABCD with points A, B, C, D, and another rectangle EFGH with points E, F, G, H. Now, it says that D, E, C, F are collinear. That means these four points lie on a straight line. So, if I think about the arrangement, maybe E is somewhere between D and C, or maybe it's extended beyond one of them? Hmm.

Also, all points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. I remember that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees, but I'm not sure if that's immediately useful here. Maybe properties of cyclic quadrilaterals could come into play, like Ptolemy's theorem or something else.

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Let me note down the given information:

- ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. Therefore, AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16.
- EFGH is another rectangle, so EF = GH = 184, FG = EH = 17.
- Points D, E, C, F are collinear, so they lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as l.
- Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

I think I should try to sketch this out.

So, rectangle ABCD: let me assume A is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC is 16, so point C would be at (107, 16), and point D would be at (0, 16).

Wait, no. Actually, since ABCD is a rectangle, the coordinates would be such that AB is horizontal, BC vertical. But whether it's going up or down depends on the orientation. Let me just assign coordinates assuming ABCD is placed with A at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). So, that's rectangle ABCD.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Since EF = 184 and FG = 17, if I follow the same orientation, E would be at some point, F at (E.x +184, E.y), G at (E.x +184, E.y +17), and H at (E.x, E.y +17). But wait, the way the points are arranged, EFGH is another rectangle, but I don't know where it's placed yet.

But the key is that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D, E, C, F lie on line l.

Wait, point D is at (0,16), and point C is at (107,16). So, line l is the line that connects D (0,16) and C (107,16). That's a horizontal line at y=16. So, points E and F must lie somewhere on this line y=16.

But E and F are points of rectangle EFGH. So, E is connected to F, which is part of EFGH. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is a side of length 184, which is much longer than FG=17. So, EF is a horizontal side if we follow the same orientation as ABCD.

Wait, but if EF is 184 and FG is 17, then in rectangle EFGH, EF is horizontal, FG is vertical, similar to ABCD.

But given that E and F are on line l (y=16), and points D and C are also on line l. So, E must be somewhere on the line y=16, either between D and C or extended beyond.

Wait, D is at (0,16), E is somewhere on y=16, F is also on y=16. So, E and F are consecutive points on line l, connected by EF=184. So, if I imagine E and F being points on the line y=16, separated by 184 units.

But wait, D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16). So, if E is between D and C, then E is at (x,16), and F would be at (x
