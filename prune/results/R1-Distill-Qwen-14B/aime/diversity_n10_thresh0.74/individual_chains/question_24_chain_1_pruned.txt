Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The problem says:

A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the same page. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's a unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So that tells me that the median isn't one of the numbers in the list, which is interesting.

Let me think about the possible lengths of the list. Since we're dealing with the median, the list could have an odd or even number of elements. But let's consider both possibilities.

Let me denote the list as a sorted list: [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], where a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n, and n is the number of elements.

First, the sum is 30. So, a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = 30.

The mode is 9, which is unique. So, 9 appears more times than any other number. That means if there are other numbers, they can appear at most as many times as 9 minus one. For example, if 9 appears twice, others can appear once or twice, but since 9 is the unique mode, others can't appear twice. Wait, no, if 9 appears twice, others can appear once or twice but since 9 is the mode, no other number can have the same count as 9. Wait, no: the mode is the most frequent. So if 9 appears m times, all other numbers appear fewer than m times. So for example, if 9 appears 3 times, others can appear at most 2 times.

But wait, 9 is the unique mode, so if another number appears the same number of times as 9, that would make it a multi-mode. So, to ensure 9 is the unique mode, all other numbers must appear fewer times than 9.

So, for example, if 9 appears three times, others can appear at most twice, but since 9 is the only one appearing three times, it's unique. If 9 appears four times, others can appear up to three times, but again, 9 is the only one with four.

Now, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So depending on whether the list length is odd or even, the median is either the middle element (if odd) or the average of the two middle elements (if even). Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, let's consider both
