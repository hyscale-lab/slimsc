Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to wrap my head around it. 

The problem says: For an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you write n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. They gave an example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. Cool, so I think I get the basic idea.

Now, the task is to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So, I need to figure out for each b, how many n satisfy these two conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me restate the conditions to make sure I understand them. 

1. n has exactly two digits in base b. That means n can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, which is equivalent to saying that n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1 in decimal. Because in base b, the first digit can't be zero, so the smallest two-digit number is 10_b which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b which is b^2 - 1.

2. The sum of the two digits in base b equals the square root of n. So, if the two digits are a and c, then a + c = sqrt(n). But n is equal to a*b + c in decimal because it's a two-digit number in base b.

So, putting it all together, we have:

n = a*b + c

and

a + c = sqrt(n)

So, we can write sqrt(n) as a + c, which implies that n = (a + c)^2.

But n is also a two-digit number in base b, so n must satisfy b ≤ n ≤ b^2 - 1.

So substituting n from the first equation into the second, we have:

b ≤ a*b + c ≤ b^2 - 1

But since n = (a + c)^2, we can write:

b ≤ (a + c)^2 ≤ b^2 - 1

So, (a + c)^2 must be between b and b^2 - 1. Additionally, a and c are digits in base b, so a can be from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit) and c can be from 0 to b-1.

So, let me try to formalize this. Let’s denote s = a + c. Then, n = s^2. Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, that means:

b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 - 1

So, taking square roots on all sides:

sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1)

But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is just a bit less than b, so s is at most b - 1 because s has to be an integer. Wait, because s is the sum of two digits, which are both integers, so s must also be an integer.

Wait, but sqrt(b^2 - 1) is less than b, so s can be up to floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)).

But let's think about this. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, s must satisfy:

sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ b - 1

Because s = a + c, and a is at least 1, c is at least 0, so s is at least 1. But n is at least b, so s^2 is at least b, meaning s is at least sqrt(b). So, s is in the range [sqrt(b), b - 1].

But s has to be an integer, so s must be an integer in that interval.

So, for each base b, we can find all possible s such that sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ b - 1, and for each s, check how many pairs (a, c) with a in [1, b-1] and c in [0, b-1] satisfy a + c = s and s^2 = a*b + c.

Wait, but s^2 = a*b + c, and a + c = s. So, let me write that as a system of equations:

a + c = s
a*b + c = s^2

Subtract the first equation from the second:

a*b + c - (a + c) = s^2 - s
a*(b - 1) = s^2 - s

So, a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b - 1, this fraction must result in an integer, and that integer must be within the valid range for a.

So, for each s, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). And then a must be (s^2 - s)/(b - 1), and then c = s - a.

Moreover, c must be between 0 and b - 1, inclusive.

So, summarizing the steps:

For each base b:

1. Determine the possible values of s, which are integers such that sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ b - 1.

2. For each s in this
