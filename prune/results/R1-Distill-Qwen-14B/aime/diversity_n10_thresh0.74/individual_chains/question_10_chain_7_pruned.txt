Okay, so I've got this problem here: Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So Alice picks a set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to figure out what A is, or at least the sum of its elements.

Wait, so for any finite nonempty set B, the maximum element is in A. So all these B sets have their maximums in A. So A must be a set that contains all the possible maximums of these B sets. But how does that help me?

I think I should model this. Let me consider what a set B can look like. Since B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and its maximum is in A, then for each element m in A, any set B can be formed by choosing m as the maximum and then including any subset of the positive integers less than m.

Wait, that sounds right. So for each m in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum m is 2^{m-1}. Because, for each m, the elements of B must be a non-empty subset where m is the largest. So you can choose any subset of the numbers less than m, and add m to it. The number of subsets is 2^{m-1}, since there are m-1 numbers less than m, each can be included or not.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if m is the maximum, then B must contain m and any subset of the numbers less than m. But B has to be non-empty, but since we're including m, each such B is non-empty. So for each m, the number of such B's is 2^{m-1}.

So the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1}. Because for each m in A, you have 2^{m-1} sets B with maximum m.

So according to the problem, this sum equals 2024. So:

Sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

I need to find the sum of elements of A. So if I can find what elements are in A, I can add them up. But first, I need to figure out what A is such that the sum of 2^{m-1} for each m in A is 2024.

Hmm. So maybe A is a set where each element is the next power of 2 or something. Because 2^{m-1} is a power of two, so the sum of different powers of two would give a unique number.

Wait, so let me think. If A consists of certain exponents, say, if A = {k1, k2, ..., kn}, then Sum_{i=1 to n} 2^{ki-1} = 2024.

But 2024 is a specific number. Let's see what 2024 is in terms
