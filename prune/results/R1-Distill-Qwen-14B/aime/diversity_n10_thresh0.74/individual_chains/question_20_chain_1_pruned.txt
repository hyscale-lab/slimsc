Okay, so I've come across this math problem, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem is about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for all chips in the same column.
3. Additionally, any extra chip placed would violate the previous two conditions.

So, the goal is to find the number of ways to place some of these chips on the grid following these rules.

Hmm, let me think. Each row must have chips of the same color, and each column must as well. So, for each row, I can decide whether it's all white or all black. Similarly, for each column, it's all white or all black. But wait, there's a catch. Because if a row is all white, then all the columns that intersect with this row must also be all white? Or is that not necessarily the case?

Wait, no. Because suppose a row is all white. Then every column that intersects this row must have all white chips in that column. But if another row is, say, all black, then the columns that intersect that row must have all black chips. But this would create a conflict in the columns where a white row and a black row intersect.

Wait, so that can't happen. So, if a row is all white, then all the columns in that row must be white. But if another row is all black, then the columns in that row must also be black. But then, for the columns that are in both rows, they can't be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, it seems that all rows and all columns must be of the same color. But that can't be right, because then the entire grid would be all white or all black, but the problem says "some of these chips," implying that not all cells are filled.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to consider the possibilities.

Each row must be all white or all black. Similarly, each column must be all white or all black. But then how do these interact? Because if a row is all white, then every cell in that row is white, which affects the columns
