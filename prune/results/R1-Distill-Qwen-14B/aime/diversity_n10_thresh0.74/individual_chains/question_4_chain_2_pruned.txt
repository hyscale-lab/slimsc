Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. It's a turn-based game, so it's probably a combinatorial game where each position can be classified as either a winning or a losing position for the player about to move. So, maybe I should model this using the concept of Grundy numbers or something similar.

Wait, but maybe it's simpler than that. Let's see. The key here is to figure out for each n, whether the first player (Alice) can force a win or if the second player (Bob) can. So, for each n, we determine if it's a winning (N-position) or losing (P-position) position.

In such games, the losing positions are those where no matter what move you make, your opponent can force a win. Conversely, winning positions are those where there exists at least one move that leads the opponent into a losing position.

So, let's define the positions:

- If n = 0, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So, n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't move.
- For n = 1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position.
- For n = 2: The current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if n=2, if the current player takes 1, leaving 1, the opponent takes the last one and wins. So the current player can't win that way. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, n=2, so they can't. So n=2 is a losing position?
Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, n=0: losing position because you can't move, so the previous player wins.

n=1: you can take 1 and win. So n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: you can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who then takes 1 and wins. So taking 1 from n=2 leaves the opponent in a winning position. Alternatively, can't take 4, so the only option is taking 1, which is bad. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So, for n=2, current player loses.

n=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So n=3 is a winning position.

n=4: current player can take 4, winning immediately. So n=4 is a winning position.

Wait, but let me make a table for small n to see the pattern.

Let me list n from 0 to, say, 10, and for each n, note if it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n | outcome (current player can win?)
--- | ---
0 | L (no move)
1 | W (take 1)
2 | L (only take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins)
3 | W (take 1, opponent gets n=2 which is L)
4 | W (take 4)
5 | ?
Wait, let's compute step by step.

n=0: L
n=1: W (take 1)
n=2: Can take 1, leading to n=1 (W for opponent). No other moves. So n=2 is L.
n=3: Can take 1, leading to n=2 (L for opponent). So n=3 is W.
n=4: Can take 1, leading to n=3 (W for opponent), or take 4, leading to n=0 (L for opponent). So since taking 4 is possible, n=4 is W.
n=5: Let's see. The current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (
