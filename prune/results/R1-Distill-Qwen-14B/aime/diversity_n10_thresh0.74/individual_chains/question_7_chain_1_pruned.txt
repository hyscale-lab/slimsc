Okay, so I've got this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention that the probability is m/n with m and n coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Let me try to unpack this. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each of which can be colored red or blue with 50% chance each. So, each vertex is independent, and the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the problem is about rotation. So, I need to think about rotations of the octagon and how the colors shift. The key here is that after some rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. That is, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps (let's say k steps, where k is between 0 and 7), each blue vertex in the original configuration should end up on a red vertex in the original configuration.

Wait, so for a given coloring, I want to check whether there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices are mapped to red positions. Hmm.

Let me think about this in terms of group theory. The set of rotations forms a cyclic group of order 8. Each rotation can be considered as a permutation of the vertices. For the condition to hold, the blue vertices after rotation must coincide with the red vertices in the original configuration.

Alternatively, if I denote the original coloring as a binary vector (R=0, B=1), then the rotated vector must have 1s only where the original vector had 0s. That is, the rotated coloring is the complement of the original coloring.

Wait, that seems like a key insight. Let me formalize that. Letâ€™s say the original coloring is C. After a rotation by k positions, the coloring becomes Rot_k(C). We need Rot_k(C) = ~C, where ~C is the bitwise complement of C (changing red to blue and vice versa).

So, the condition is that there exists some rotation k such that Rot_k(C) equals ~C. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings C for which such a rotation k exists, and then dividing by the total number of colorings (256) to get the probability.

But how do we count such colorings C?

Hmm, perhaps
