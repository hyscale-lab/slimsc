Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for red or blue. The question is about finding the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red ones. Hmm, that's a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.

First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each equally spaced around a circle. The octagon can be rotated in steps of 45 degrees because 360/8 = 45. So, there are eight possible rotational symmetries, right? Each rotation corresponds to shifting the octagon by one vertex position. For example, rotating 45 degrees moves each vertex to the next position clockwise, and so on.

Now, the problem is about the coloring of these vertices. Each is colored red or blue, each with probability 1/2, and the colorings are independent. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's the denominator for our probability.

The numerator will be the number of colorings where there's some rotation that maps all blue vertices to red ones. Wait, no, the problem says: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." Hmm, so perhaps it's a bit more precise. It's not just any rotation, but a rotation such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was red before the rotation.

Wait, I'm trying to parse the problem again. It says: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, perhaps, if we do a rotation, the blue vertices (after rotation) land on positions that were originally red. So, the key is that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices, or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of functions. Let me imagine that we have a coloring, which is a function from the set of vertices to {red, blue}. Then, applying a rotation is a permutation of the vertices, and we want that after this permutation, every vertex that was blue is now in a position that was previously red. So, in other words, the image of the blue set under this rotation is a
