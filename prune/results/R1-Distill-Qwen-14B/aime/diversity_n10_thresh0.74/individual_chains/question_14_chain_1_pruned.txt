Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the greatest four-digit number N with a certain property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find this N, I need to find Q and R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000 and R is the remainder. Finally, I have to find Q + R.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the greatest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the condition.

But the condition is a bit tricky. Whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is abcd (a four-digit number), then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives abc1. All four of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Wait, but N itself doesn't necessarily have to be divisible by 7, only the numbers obtained by changing each digit to 1. Interesting.

So, my plan is to find the largest N such that:

1. Changing the thousands digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.
2. Changing the hundreds digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.
3. Changing the tens digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.
4. Changing the units digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

I need to find such an N, and it has to be the largest possible four-digit number.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can model each condition mathematically.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is at least 1.

Now, when I change the thousands digit to 1, the number becomes 1bcd, which is 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's call this number N1.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit to 1 gives a1cd = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let's call this N2.

Changing the tens digit to 1 gives ab1d = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let's call this N3.

Changing the units digit to 1 gives abc1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of these numbers N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

I can write each of these congruences as follows:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, perhaps I can express each of these in terms of N. Let's see:

Wait, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

N1 is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d, which can be written as (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - 1000a + 1000*1? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, N1 is 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

But N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

So N1 = (N - 1000a) + 1000.

Similarly, N2 = (N - 100b) + 100.

N3 = (N - 10c) + 10.

N4 = (N - d) + 1.

So, N1 = N - 1000a + 1000,
N2 = N - 100b + 100,
N3 = N - 10c + 10,
N4 = N - d + 1.

Each of these must be ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, we can write:

1. N - 1000a + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N - 100b + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N - 10c + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N - d + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Which can be rearranged as:

1. N ≡ 1000a - 1000 mod 7
2. N ≡ 100b - 100 mod 7
3. N ≡ 10c - 10 mod 7
4. N ≡ d - 1 mod 7

But N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

So, substituting N into the congruences:

1. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 1000a - 1000 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 100b - 100 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 10c - 10 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ d - 1 mod 7

Let me subtract the right-hand sides from both sides to bring everything to the left:

1. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 1000a + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
   Simplifies to: 100b + 10c + d + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 100b + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7
   Simplifies to: 1000a + 10c + d + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 10c + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7
   Simplifies to: 1000a + 100b + d + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d - d + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
   Simplifies to: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So now, I have four congruences:

1. 100b + 10c + d + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 10c + d + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + d + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, maybe I can compute the coefficients modulo 7 to simplify.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, etc., since modular arithmetic can be simplified by reducing the coefficients first.

Compute 1000 mod 7:

1000 / 7 is 142 * 7 = 994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7.

100 / 7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So let's rewrite each congruence with these:

1. (100b + 10c + d) + 1000 ≡ (2b + 3c + d) + 6 ≡ 0 mod 7
   So, 2b + 3c + d + 6 ≡ 0 mod 7
   Or, 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7. (Because
