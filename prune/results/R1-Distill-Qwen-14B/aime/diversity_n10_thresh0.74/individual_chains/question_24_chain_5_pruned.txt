Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand all the constraints.

The list is a positive integer list with three main properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's a unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.
- **Median**: The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of two middle numbers, which is an integer not present in the list. If it's odd, the median is the middle number, but that can't be in the list, which is interesting because the middle number in an odd-length list is part of the list. So that suggests that the list must have an even number of elements because if it's odd, the median is in the list, which contradicts the third condition. So the list must have an even number of elements.

Wait, but let me confirm that. If the list has an even number of elements, say 2k, then the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. Since the median is a positive integer not present in the list, that average must be an integer, meaning the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd, but their average is an integer not in the list.

Okay, so the list has an even number of elements. Let's note that.

So, the list length is even. Let's denote the number of elements as n, where n is even. So, n = 2k for some integer k.

Our goal is to find such a list that satisfies all three conditions and then compute the sum of squares of its elements.

Let me think about how to construct such a list.

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, the number of 9s, let's say m, must be greater than the number of times any other number appears.

The sum of all elements is 30, so 9*m + sum of other elements = 30.

Also, the list has n elements, so n = m + (number of other elements).

Since the mode is 9, and it's unique, m must be greater than the count of any other number.

Let me consider possible values for m. Since 9 is the mode, m has to be at least 2, but let's see what's possible.

If m is 3, then the sum contributed by 9s is 27, leaving 3 for other elements. But other elements have to sum to 3, and since they are positive integers, they can be 1, 1, 1. But then 1 would appear three times, which would make it a mode as well, but the problem says the unique mode is 9. So that can't be. So m can't be 3.

Wait, that's a good point. If m=3, then 9*3=27, and the remaining 3 could be 1,1,1, which would make 1 appear three times, same as 9. But the mode is unique, so that's not allowed. So m must be more than 3.

What if m=4? Then 9*4=36, which is already more than 30. So that's impossible because the total sum is 30. So m cannot be 4.

Wait, that's a problem. So if m=4, 9*4=36>30, so that's not possible. So m must be less than 4. But m=3 is not allowed because it would create another mode if the remaining sum is split into 3 ones. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the other numbers don't all have to be 1. Let me see.

If m=3, sum from 9s is 27, so remaining sum is 3.

We need to distribute 3 among other elements, but since all elements are positive integers, the possible ways are:

- 3 as a single number: [3], but then the counts would be 3:1, 9:
