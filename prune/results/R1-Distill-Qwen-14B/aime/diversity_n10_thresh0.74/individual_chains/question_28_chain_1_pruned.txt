Alright, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n/p, and then I have to find m + n + p. 

First, let me visualize the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, the edges are given in pairs: AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like the edges are paired oppositely, which might mean the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

Wait, but how do I compute the volume? Since all the edges are given, maybe I can use some formula related to the edge lengths. I think there's a formula called the Cayley-Menger determinant that can help find the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths. Let me recall how that works.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the following matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

So I need to construct this matrix with the given edge lengths.

Given:
AB = √41 => a² = 41
AC = √80 => b² = 80
AD = √89 => c² = 89
BC = √89 => d² = 89
BD = √80 => e² = 80
CD = √41 => f² = 41

So plugging these into the matrix, it becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The matrix is symmetric, so the positions (i,j) and (j,i) should be the same. Let me see:

- (1,2) is a² = 41, so (2,1) should also be 41. Correct.
- (1,3) is b² = 80, so (3,1) is 80. Correct.
- (1,4) is c² = 89, so (4,1) is 89. Correct.

Similarly, row 2: (2,3) is d² = 89, (2,4) is e² =80. Correct.

Row 3: (3,4) is f² =41. Correct.

Okay, so
