Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. It's like a donut shape. Then there's a sphere with radius 11. The question is about finding the difference between two radii, r_i and r_o, which are the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere when resting inside and outside, respectively.

Hmm, alright, let me break this down. First, I need to visualize the torus. A torus is a surface of revolution, so it's formed by rotating a circle around an external axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is 3. So, the torus is pretty large.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. I need to find the tangent circles when the torus is inside the sphere and when it's outside. The difference between these two radii is r_i - r_o, and I have to express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

I think I need to find the points where the torus touches the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle; same when it's outside. The radii of these circles depend on the distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of the torus, perhaps?

Wait, let's think about the geometry here. The sphere is centered where? Hmm, I think the sphere's center is the same as the center of the torus's axis of revolution. Because when the torus is placed inside the sphere, it's resting on the inside, so the sphere must be enclosing the torus such that the closest point of the torus is tangent to the sphere's inner surface.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The torus is produced by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So, the torus's major radius is 6, and minor radius is 3. So, the center of the sphere is probably at the same point as the center of the generating circle of the torus. Because when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's farthest point would be the sphere's radius.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to draw a diagram in my mind. The torus is like a donut, with the hole in the middle. The major radius is 6, so the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis. The sphere has radius 11, so when the torus is inside the sphere, the farthest point of the torus from the center is 6 + 3 = 9 units. But the sphere has a radius of 11, which is larger. So, the torus is entirely inside the sphere when resting
