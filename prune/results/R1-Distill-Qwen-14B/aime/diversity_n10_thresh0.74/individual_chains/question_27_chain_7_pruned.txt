Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside or the outside of this sphere. When it's inside, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's touching along another circle. I need to find the radii of these two circles and subtract them.

Let me try to model this. The torus can be thought of as the surface of revolution of a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, in coordinates, maybe the center of the generating circle moves along a circle of radius 6 in the x-y plane. The sphere has radius 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the origin is at a distance equal to the sphere's radius minus the maximum distance from the origin on the torus. Wait, no, maybe I should think about the distance from the origin to the center of the torus's tube. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this more systematically.

Let me recall that a torus can be represented parametrically. The standard parametric equations for a torus with major radius R and minor radius r are:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

where θ and φ are angles between 0 and 2π.

In our case, R (the major radius) is 6, and r (the minor radius) is 3. So the parametric equations become:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere of radius 11, the points where they are tangent are points on both surfaces. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the tangent points lie on both surfaces.

So, let's consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere. At the point of tangency, the distance from the origin to any point on the torus must be equal to 11. So, for some θ and φ, the point (x, y, z) on the torus satisfies x² + y² + z² = 121.

Since the torus is symmetric, the point of tangency should lie along a circle where the distance from the origin is constant. So, maybe I can find the radius of this circle in terms of the sphere and torus parameters.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the distance from the origin to a general point on the torus. Let's compute x² + y² + z² for the parametric equations.

x² + y² + z² = [ (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ ]² + [ (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ ]² + [ 3 sin θ ]²

Simplify that
