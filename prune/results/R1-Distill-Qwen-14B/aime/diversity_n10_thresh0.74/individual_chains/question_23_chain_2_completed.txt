Okay, I need to solve this problem where points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, forming a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, each vertex of the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, B and D would be symmetric points.

Wait, no. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if the diagonals intersect at the origin, each point has its opposite point as the reflection through the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), and similarly for B and D.

But in this problem, all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, each of these points must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Now, let's denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.

But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the midpoints of the diagonals are the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoints at (0,0).

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the slopes of AC and BD are negative reciprocals.

Let me consider the coordinates of the points. Let me suppose that point A is (x1, y1), so point C is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, let me denote point B as (x2, y2), so point D is (-x2, -y2).

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, each satisfies x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, for A: x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1; same for B, C, D.

Now, the rhombus has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. Also, the diagonals are AC and BD, which intersect at the origin.

Another property of a rhombus is that the area can be expressed as (AC * BD)/2. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD is zero.

Vector AC is from A to C, which is (-x1 - x1, -y1 - y1) = (-2x1, -2y1). Wait, no, AC is from A to C, but since the origin is the midpoint, the vector AC is ( -x1 - x1, -y1 - y1 )? Wait, no, that's not right. The vector AC is from point A to point C, which is ( -x1 - x1, -y1 - y1 )? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, point A is (x1, y1) and point C is (-x1, -y1). So, vector AC is C - A = (-x1 - x1, -y1 - y1) = (-2x1, -2y1). Similarly, vector BD is D - B = (-x2 - x2, -y2 - y2) = (-2x2, -2y2).

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so their vectors must be perpendicular. So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero.

So, AC • BD = (-2x1)(-2x2) + (-2y1)(-2y2) = 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0.

Dividing both sides by 4: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0. So, that's one equation.

Another thing is that the sides are equal. Let's compute the length of AB and AD.

Point A is (x1, y1); point B is (x2, y2). The distance AB is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].

Similarly, the distance AD is sqrt[(-x2 - x1)^2 + (-y2 - y1)^2] = sqrt[( -x2 -x1 )^2 + (-y2 - y1)^2] = sqrt[(x2 + x1)^2 + (y2 + y1)^2].

Since all sides are equal, AB = AD. So,

sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2] = sqrt[(x2 + x1)^2 + (y2 + y1)^2].

Squaring both sides:

(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x2 + x1)^2 + (y2 + y1)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left: x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1².

Right: x2² + 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² + 2y1y2 + y1².

Subtracting left from right:

0 = 4x1x2 + 4y1y2.

So, 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0 → x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, which is consistent with the earlier equation from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, that doesn't give us any new information.

Hmm, okay, so perhaps I should use the fact that points A, B are on the hyperbola and the above condition.

So, let me summarize:

1. x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1.

2. x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1.

3. x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

Additionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, etc., are equal. But I already used that condition, which only gave me the x1x2 + y1y2=0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of parametric coordinates for the hyperbola.

I remember that hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, a parametrization is (a secθ, b tanθ). Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed using (a cosh t, b sinh t), but that's for hyperbola opening sideways. Wait, but in this case, our hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 =1, which is a standard hyperbola opening left and right.

So, parametric equations can be written as x = sqrt(20) secθ, y = sqrt(24) tanθ. Alternatively, using hyperbolic functions: x = sqrt(20) cosh t, y = sqrt(24) sinh t. Because cosh² t - sinh² t =1, so that x²/20 - y²/24 = (20 cosh² t)/20 - (24 sinh² t)/24 = cosh² t - sinh² t =1.

Yes, that works. So, perhaps using hyperbolic parametrization would be helpful.

So, let me set point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Then, point C is (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t). Similarly, point B is (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), and point D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).

Wait, but in this parametrization, t and s are parameters. However, since the diagonals are perpendicular, I think we can link t and s.

Wait, from earlier, we have the condition x1x2 + y1y2 =0.

So, substituting the parametrizations:

x1 = sqrt(20) cosh t, y1 = sqrt(24) sinh t.

x2 = sqrt(20) cosh s, y2 = sqrt(24) sinh s.

So, x1x2 + y1y2 = (sqrt(20) cosh t)(sqrt(20) cosh s) + (sqrt(24) sinh t)(sqrt(24) sinh s) = 0.

Compute this:

20 cosh t cosh s + 24 sinh t sinh s =0.

So, 20 cosh t cosh s +24 sinh t sinh s=0.

Hmm, that's the condition we have.

So, 20 cosh t cosh s = -24 sinh t sinh s.

Divide both sides by cosh t cosh s (assuming they are non-zero):

20 = -24 tanh t tanh s.

So, tanh t tanh s = -20/24 = -5/6.

So, tanh t tanh s = -5/6.

Interesting. So, the product of the hyperbolic tangents of the parameters t and s is -5/6.

Now, our aim is to find BD².

Point B is (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), point D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in our earlier parametrization, points A, B, C, D are four points, each parametrized by t and s. Wait, but in the parametrization, the coordinates are parametrized by t and s. However, in the rhombus, points are A, B, C, D, each with their own parameters. But given the condition that diagonals are perpendicular and the products of hyperbolic tangents is -5/6, perhaps I can find BD² in terms of s.

Wait, but BD is the distance between points B and D. Wait, no, BD is the diagonal from B to D, but since D is (-x2, -y2), the diagonal BD goes from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2). So, the length of BD is the distance between these two points. Let's compute BD².

BD² = (x2 - (-x2))² + (y2 - (-y2))² = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2² +4y2² =4(x2² + y2²).

Similarly, AC² =4(x1² + y1²).

So, BD² =4(x2² + y2²).

But since point B is on the hyperbola, x2²/20 - y2²/24 =1, so y2² = (x2²/20 -1)*24.

So, BD² =4(x2² + (x2²/20 -1)*24 )

Simplify this:

=4[ x2² + (24x2²)/20 -24 ]

=4[ x2² + (6x2²)/5 -24 ]

=4[ (5x2² +6x2²)/5 -24 ]

=4[ (11x2²)/5 -24 ]

= (44x2²)/5 -96.

So, BD² = (44/5)x2² -96.

Our aim is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD², right? Because the question is asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, if we can find the minimum possible value of BD², then that would be the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD² would be just below that minimum.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that would be the infimum of BD², because it's the greatest lower bound. So, if we can find the minimum value of BD², then that minimum is the infimum, and the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be just less than that minimum. Wait, no, no. Wait, the question is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi. So, that is the infimum of BD². Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, for all rhombi, BD² is greater than or equal to the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is the infimum itself. Wait, but if the infimum is attainable, then BD² can be equal to the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be just less than the infimum. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think again. The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, it's the supremum of all such lower bounds. So, if BD² can get arbitrarily close to some value from above, then the greatest lower bound is that value. But if BD² can actually reach a minimum value, then that minimum is the infimum, but the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum. Wait, no. Because if the infimum is attainable, then BD² can be equal to it, so any number less than the infimum would not be a lower bound for all BD². Hence, the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi is the infimum. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, if BD² is always greater than or equal to m, where m is the infimum, then m is the greatest number less than or equal to all BD², but the question is asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi. Hmm, perhaps the wording is confusing me.

Wait, maybe it's better to find the minimum possible value of BD². Because if we can find the minimal value that BD² can take, then that minimal value would be the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be that minimal value. Because BD² can be equal to that minimal value, but cannot be lower. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is the minimal value of BD².

Wait, no. Let me think: if BD² can achieve a minimal value of m, then for all rhombi, BD² ≥ m. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be m, because m is the minimal BD². Because for all rhombi, BD² is at least m, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is m, because if you take any number greater than m, there exists a rhombus with BD² equal to m, so that number would not be less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Suppose m is the minimal BD². Then, m ≤ BD² for all rhombi. The question is, find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all rhombi. So, the number must be less than BD² for every rhombus. So, the maximal such number is the infimum of BD². Because if the infimum is m, then BD² ≥ m for all rhombi, so m is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, any number less than m would not be a lower bound for all BD², because BD² can get as low as m. But wait, if m is the infimum, then BD² can approach m but may not actually reach it. Hmm, that's a possibility.

Wait, in our case, can BD² actually reach a minimal value, or does it approach a limit? So, perhaps we need to find the minimal possible BD², considering the constraints.

So, to find the minimal BD², we can express BD² in terms of x2², as above: BD² = (44/5)x2² -96.

But also, from the condition x1x2 + y1y2 =0, which with the parametrization gives tanh t tanh s = -5/6.

We can perhaps link x1 and x2, or express x2 in terms of x1, or find a relation between x1 and x2.

Wait, let me see. Since I have BD² in terms of x2², perhaps I can express x2² in terms of x1² using the condition x1x2 + y1y2=0.

Given that:

From the hyperbola equation, y1² = (x1²/20 -1)*24, and y2² = (x2²/20 -1)*24.

But from the condition x1x2 + y1y2=0, square both sides:

(x1x2 + y1y2)^2 =0.

Which gives x1²x2² + 2x1x2y1y2 + y1²y2² =0.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, since we have tanh t tanh s = -5/6, perhaps we can relate the parameters t and s.

Wait, let's denote u = tanh t and v = tanh s. Then, from the condition, we have u*v = -5/6.

Moreover, we can express x1, y1, x2, y2 in terms of u and v.

Wait, from parametrization:

x1 = sqrt(20) cosh t, and since cosh t = 1 / sqrt(1 - sinh² t) = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²), because sinh t = u, so cosh t = sqrt(1 + u²).

Wait, no, if u = tanh t, then tanh t = sinh t / cosh t = u. So, sinh t = u cosh t, and cosh² t = 1 + sinh² t = 1 + u² cosh² t, so cosh² t(1 - u²) =1 → cosh t = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²).

So, x1 = sqrt(20) * 1 / sqrt(1 - u²), and y1 = sqrt(24) * u / sqrt(1 - u²).

Similarly, x2 = sqrt(20) / sqrt(1 - v²), y2 = sqrt(24) v / sqrt(1 - v²).

Since u*v = -5/6.

Now, BD² is (44/5)x2² -96. Let's express x2² in terms of v.

x2² = 20 / (1 - v²).

So, BD² = (44/5)*(20/(1 - v²)) -96 = (44/5)*(20)/(1 - v²) -96.

Simplify:

44/5 * 20 = (44 * 20)/5 = 44*4 = 176.

So, BD² = 176 / (1 - v²) -96.

So, BD² = 176/(1 - v²) -96.

We can write this as BD² = (176 -96(1 - v²)) / (1 - v²).

Wait, let's compute numerator: 176 -96(1 - v²) =176 -96 +96v²=80 +96v².

So, BD² = (80 +96v²)/(1 - v²).

Hmm, okay. So, BD² is expressed in terms of v². Let me denote z = v². Since v = tanh s, and tanh s is between -1 and 1, so z is between 0 and1.

So, BD² = (80 +96 z)/(1 - z).

We can write this as BD² = (80 +96z)/(1 - z) = [80(1 - z) + 80z +96z]/(1 - z) = 80 + (176 z)/(1 - z). Wait, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make it a function of z:

f(z) = (80 +96 z)/(1 - z), where z ∈ (0,1).

We need to find the minimal value of f(z) for z ∈ (0,1).

But wait, from the condition that u*v = -5/6, and u = tanh t, v = tanh s. Since u*v = -5/6, and u and v are hyperbolic tangents, which can be positive or negative, but their product is negative. So, one of u or v is positive, and the other is negative.

But z = v², so z is positive regardless of the sign of v.

So, our function is f(z) = (80 +96 z)/(1 - z), with z ∈ (0,1).

But we also have to consider the condition u*v = -5/6. Since u = tanh t, v = tanh s, and u*v = -5/6. Since u and v are related, perhaps there is a constraint on z.

Wait, let me think. From u*v = -5/6.

But u² = tanh² t = [ (cosh² t -1) / cosh² t ] = [ (x1²/20 -1) *20 ] / x1² = (x1² -20)/x1² = 1 -20/x1².

Similarly, v² = tanh² s = 1 -20/x2².

Wait, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since u*v = -5/6, then (u*v)^2 =25/36.

But u² * v² =25/36.

But u² = (tanh t)^2 = [ sinh² t / cosh² t ] = [ (y1² /24) / (x1² /20) ] because from parametrization, y1 = sqrt(24) sinh t, x1 = sqrt(20) cosh t.

So, sinh t = y1 / sqrt(24), cosh t = x1 / sqrt(20).

So, u = tanh t = sinh t / cosh t = (y1 / sqrt(24)) / (x1 / sqrt(20)) ) = (y1 / sqrt(24)) * (sqrt(20)/x1 ) = y1 sqrt(20/24) /x1.

Simplify sqrt(20/24)=sqrt(5/6)=sqrt(30)/6. So, u = y1 * sqrt(30)/(6 x1).

Similarly, v = y2 sqrt(30)/(6 x2).

So, u*v = [ y1 y2 (30) ] / (36 x1 x2 ) ) = (30 y1 y2 )/(36 x1 x2 ) = (5 y1 y2 )/(6 x1 x2 ).

But we have from condition x1x2 + y1y2=0 → y1y2 = -x1x2.

So, u*v = (5*(-x1x2))/(6x1x2 )= -5/6, which is consistent with the earlier condition.

So, that doesn't give us any additional constraints.

Hmm, perhaps I can consider f(z) = (80 +96 z)/(1 - z), and find its minimum for z ∈ (0,1).

Wait, but is there any constraint on z besides being in (0,1)? Since u*v = -5/6, which could impose some relation on z.

Wait, if u*v = -5/6, and u and v are real numbers, then their squares satisfy (u*v)^2 =25/36= u² v².

But since u² =1 - (20/x1²), and v²=1 - (20/x2²), as I had earlier, but maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since u and v are hyperbolic tangents, their squares must be less than 1.

Wait, so u² <1 and v² <1.

But u*v = -5/6, so |u*v|=5/6 <1, which is fine.

But perhaps we can find a relationship between u² and v².

Let me denote u² = a, v² = b.

Then, a*b = (u*v)^2 =25/36.

Also, from the expressions above, in terms of the hyperbola points:

u² = (y1² /24)/(x1²/20)= (20 y1²)/(24 x1²)= (5 y1²)/(6 x1²).

Similarly, v² = (5 y2²)/(6 x2²).

But from hyperbola equation, x²/20 - y²/24=1 → y²= (x²/20 -1)*24.

So, u² = (5*( (x1²/20 -1)*24 ) )/(6 x1² )= (5*24*(x1² -20)/(20*6 x1² ))= (120*(x1² -20))/(120 x1² )= (x1² -20)/x1²=1 -20/x1².

Similarly, v²=1 -20/x2².

So, u²=1 -20/x1², v²=1 -20/x2².

Given that u*v=-5/6, let's square both sides:

u² v²=25/36.

So,

(1 -20/x1²)(1 -20/x2²)=25/36.

But do we have a relationship between x1 and x2? From the condition x1x2 + y1y2=0.

Wait, from x1x2 + y1y2=0, and y1y2= -x1x2.

So, y1y2= -x1x2.

But from hyperbola equations,

y1² = (x1² /20 -1)*24,

y2²= (x2² /20 -1)*24.

So, (y1 y2)^2 = [ (x1² /20 -1)(x2² /20 -1) ] *24².

But from y1 y2 = -x1 x2,

(y1 y2)^2 = x1² x2².

So,

x1² x2² = [ (x1² /20 -1)(x2² /20 -1) ] *24².

Let me write this equation down:

x1² x2² = [ (x1²/20 -1)(x2²/20 -1) ] * 576.

Hmm, that's a complex equation, but perhaps I can let a = x1², b =x2², then:

ab = [ (a/20 -1)(b/20 -1) ] *576.

Let me expand the right-hand side:

[ (a/20 -1)(b/20 -1) ] = (ab)/(400) - a/20 - b/20 +1.

So,

ab = [ (ab)/(400) - (a + b)/20 +1 ] *576.

Multiply both sides by 400 to eliminate denominators:

400ab = [ ab -20(a + b) +400 ] *576 /400.

Wait, maybe it's better to express it as:

ab = [ (ab -20a -20b +400)/400 ] *576.

So,

ab = (ab -20a -20b +400) * (576/400).

Simplify 576/400 = 1.44.

Wait, 576 divided by 400 is 1.44. So,

ab = 1.44(ab -20a -20b +400).

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

ab -1.44ab +1.44*20a +1.44*20b -1.44*400=0.

Compute coefficients:

1.44*20=28.8,

1.44*400=576.

So,

(1 -1.44)ab +28.8a +28.8b -576=0.

( -0.44ab ) +28.8a +28.8b -576=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.44ab -28.8a -28.8b +576=0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic in a and b, but it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relation between a and b.

From earlier, we have u*v=-5/6, with u²=1 -20/a, v²=1 -20/b.

So,

u² v²= (1 -20/a)(1 -20/b)=25/36.

So,

(1 -20/a)(1 -20/b)=25/36.

Let me expand the left side:

1 -20/a -20/b +400/(ab)=25/36.

Bring all terms to left:

1 -25/36 -20/a -20/b +400/(ab)=0.

Compute 1 -25/36=11/36.

So,

11/36 -20/a -20/b +400/(ab)=0.

Multiply both sides by 36ab to eliminate denominators:

11ab - 720b -720a +14400=0.

So,

11ab -720a -720b +14400=0.

Hmm, that's another equation connecting a and b.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this.

11ab -720a -720b +14400=0.

Let me add 720² /11 to both sides to complete the rectangle, but that seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as:

11ab -720a -720b = -14400.

Adding 720² /11 to both sides:

11ab -720a -720b + (720²)/11 = -14400 + (720²)/11.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor this equation.

11ab -720a -720b +14400=0.

Let me factor terms:

11ab -720a -720b = -14400.

Factor a from first two terms, b from next two:

a(11b -720) -720b = -14400.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, let me think about variables substitution. Let me set p =a, q =b.

So, the equation is 11pq -720p -720q +14400=0.

Perhaps rearrange as:

11pq -720p -720q = -14400.

Hmm, maybe factor as:

(11p -720)(11q -720) = something.

Wait, let me try:

11pq -720p -720q + (720²)/11 = -14400 + (720²)/11.

Wait, this is similar to completing the square.

So,

(11p -720)(11q -720)= (720²)/11 -14400.

Compute RHS:

720² = 518400.

518400 /11 ≈47127.2727.

14400 is 14400.

So,

(11p -720)(11q -720)=518400/11 -14400 = (518400 -14400*11)/11.

Compute 14400*11=158400.

So,

(518400 -158400)/11=360000/11≈32727.2727.

So,

(11p -720)(11q -720)=360000/11.

So,

(11p -720)(11q -720)=360000/11.

Hmm, so the product is 360000/11, which is positive. So, both (11p -720) and (11q -720) are positive or both are negative.

But since p =a =x1² and q =b =x2², which are greater than 20 because on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24=1, so x² must be greater than 20. So, a>20, b>20.

Thus,

11p -720>11*20 -720=220 -720= -500.

Similarly for 11q -720.

But since their product is positive, both factors must be positive or both negative.

But let me see: 11p -720 >0 ?

11p >720 → p>720/11≈65.45.

Similarly, 11q -720>0 → q>65.45.

But p and q are x1² and x2², which are greater than 20, but could be greater than 65.45, or less.

Wait, 720/11 is approximately 65.4545.

So, if p>65.45, then 11p -720 is positive. Similarly for q.

Alternatively, if p<65.45, then 11p -720 is negative.

But given that a =x1²>20, and b=x2²>20, it's possible that p and q are greater than 65.45 or not.

But in this problem, we have to consider all possible rhombi, so both cases might occur.

But perhaps in our case, since u*v=-5/6, and u and v are related, perhaps there's a relationship that p and q must satisfy.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of trying to connect a and b, I can express b in terms of a, and plug into the equation.

From equation:

11ab -720a -720b +14400=0.

Let me solve for b in terms of a.

11ab -720a -720b = -14400.

Bring terms with b to one side:

11ab -720b =720a -14400.

Factor b:

b(11a -720)=720a -14400.

So,

b= (720a -14400)/(11a -720).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator: 720a -14400=720(a -20).

Denominator: 11a -720.

So,

b= [720(a -20)] / (11a -720).

So,

b=720(a -20)/(11a -720).

Now, since b must be positive (as it's x2²), the denominator and numerator must have the same sign.

So,

Case 1: 11a -720 >0 and 720(a -20) >0.

Which implies a>720/11≈65.45 and a>20. Since a>65.45, this is satisfied.

Case 2: 11a -720 <0 and 720(a -20) <0.

Which implies a<65.45 and a<20. But since a>20, this case is not possible.

So, only case 1 is possible: a>65.45, and b=720(a -20)/(11a -720).

So, now, we can express BD² in terms of a.

From earlier, BD²= (44/5) x2² -96. x2² = b.

So, BD²= (44/5) b -96.

But b=720(a -20)/(11a -720).

So,

BD²= (44/5)*(720(a -20)/(11a -720)) -96.

Simplify:

Compute 44/5 *720= (44*720)/5=44*144=6336.

So,

BD²=6336*(a -20)/(11a -720) -96.

So,

BD² = [6336(a -20)]/(11a -720) -96.

Simplify the fraction:

Factor numerator and denominator:

6336(a -20) =6336a -126720.

Denominator:11a -720.

Let me factor 6336 and 720.

Wait, 6336 ÷ 11=576.

720 ÷11≈65.45, not integer.

Wait, let me try to write 6336(a-20)/(11a -720):

= [6336a -126720]/(11a -720).

Let me write 6336a = 576*11a.

Similarly, denominator is 11a -720=11(a -720/11)=11(a -65.4545).

So,

= [576*11a -126720]/(11a -720).

Factor numerator:

576*11a -126720=576*11a -576*220=576*(11a -220).

Wait, 576*220=126720.

Yes, because 576*200=115200, 576*20=11520; total 115200+11520=126720.

So,

Numerator=576*(11a -220).

Denominator=11a -720.

So,

BD²= [576*(11a -220)]/(11a -720) -96.

So,

BD²=576*(11a -220)/(11a -720) -96.

Let me write this as:

BD²=576*(11a -220)/(11a -720) -96.

Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this expression.

Let me write the fraction:

(11a -220)/(11a -720)= [11a -720 +500]/(11a -720)=1 +500/(11a -720).

So,

BD²=576*(1 +500/(11a -720)) -96=576 + 576*500/(11a -720) -96.

Compute 576 -96=480.

So,

BD²=480 + (288000)/(11a -720).

So, BD²=480 +288000/(11a -720).

Now, since a>65.45, and a>20, and we have from the earlier substitution that a must be greater than 65.45.

So, 11a -720 is positive, as a>65.45, so 11a>720.

So, 11a -720>0.

Thus, BD²=480 +288000/(11a -720).

We can let k=11a -720, which is positive. So,

k=11a -720 → a=(k +720)/11.

So,

BD²=480 +288000/k.

We need to find the minimal BD², which is equivalent to minimizing 480 +288000/k.

Since k>0, to minimize BD², we need to maximize k, because as k increases, 288000/k decreases.

But wait, k=11a -720, and a is x1², which can be increased indefinitely. So, as a→infty, k→infty, and BD² approaches 480.

But is there a lower bound? Wait, no, because as k approaches zero from above, 288000/k approaches infinity, making BD² approach infinity. So, BD² can be made as large as possible, but we are interested in the minimal BD².

Wait, but earlier I thought BD² approaches 480 as a→infty. But is that correct?

Wait, let me see:

As a→infty, k=11a -720→infty, so 288000/k→0, so BD²→480.

But is 480 attainable? No, because a cannot be infinity. So, BD² can get as close to 480 as desired, but cannot be less than 480.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check whether BD² can be less than 480.

If I set k=11a -720= something small, then 288000/k becomes large, so BD² becomes large.

If I set k approaching infinity, BD² approaches 480.

So, BD² is minimized when k is as large as possible, but k can be made arbitrarily large by increasing a, hence BD² approaches 480 from above.

So, the minimal BD² is 480, but it's not attainable. So, the infimum of BD² is 480.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480, because BD² is always greater than 480, and can be made arbitrarily close to 480.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check this reasoning. Because earlier, I had BD² expressed as 480 +288000/k, where k=11a -720>0.

So, to minimize BD², we need to minimize 480 +288000/k.

Which is achieved by maximizing k.

But since k can be made arbitrarily large (by taking a→∞), BD² approaches 480.

So, BD² can be made as close to 480 as we like, but never less than 480.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 480.

Thus, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi."

So, that number is 480, because BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, so it's the greatest lower bound.

Hence, the answer is 480.

Wait, but wait, let me check if this makes sense. Let me imagine a rhombus where a is very large. So, points A and C are far away on the hyperbola, and points B and D are also on the hyperbola but arranged such that the diagonals are perpendicular.

In this case, BD² approaches 480. So, the minimal BD² is 480, but since it's not attainable, the infimum is 480.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

So, the answer is 480.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the rhombus \(ABCD\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, implying that the points are symmetric with respect to the origin. The hyperbola equation is \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), and all four points \(A, B, C, D\) lie on this hyperbola.

Using the parametrization of the hyperbola with hyperbolic functions, we express the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\) as \((\sqrt{20} \cosh t, \sqrt{24} \sinh t)\) and \((\sqrt{20} \cosh s, \sqrt{24} \sinh s)\), respectively. The condition that the diagonals are perpendicular leads to the equation \(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0\), which translates to \(\tanh t \tanh s = -\frac{5}{6}\).

Expressing the length of diagonal \(BD\) in terms of the parameter \(s\), we find that \(BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)\). Substituting the hyperbola equation, we express \(BD^2\) as a function of \(s\) and simplify it to \(BD^2 = \frac{44}{5}x_2^2 - 96\). 

To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we analyze the function and determine that as the parameter \(a = x_1^2\) approaches infinity, \(BD^2\) approaches 480. Since \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than 480, the infimum of \(BD^2\) is 480.

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{480}\).
