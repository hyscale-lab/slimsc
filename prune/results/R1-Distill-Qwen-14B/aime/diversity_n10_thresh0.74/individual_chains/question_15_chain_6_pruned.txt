Okay, so I've got this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So moving from the lower left to the upper right would require moving 8 steps up and 8 steps to the right, totaling 16 steps. Each path is made up of these steps, so any path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U) in some order.

Now, the key part is that the path changes direction exactly four times. Changing direction means switching from moving right to up or vice versa. So, each time the direction changes, the path alternates between R and U.

Wait a second, how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of segments or straight lines in the path? Let me think. If a path changes direction four times, that means it has five segments. Because each direction change marks the end of one segment and the start of another. So, for example, if I go right, then up, then right, then up, etc., each switch is a new segment.

But wait, the starting direction counts as the first segment. So if I have four direction changes, that's five segments in total. Each segment must be either all right moves or all up moves.

So, for an 8x8 grid, the number of right moves is 8 and the number of up moves is 8. These have to be divided into five segments, alternating between R and U.

But wait, we have to alternate directions. So the segments must alternate between R and U. So, if the first segment is R, the next must be U, then R, then U, etc. Alternatively, if the first segment is U, then R, and so on.

So, the path can start with either R or U, and then alternates. Since the total number of direction changes is four, the number of segments is five. So, the path can start with R and have segments R, U, R, U, R, or it can start with U and have segments U, R, U, R, U.

Wait, but with five segments, the starting direction determines the number of R and U segments. Let's consider both cases.

Case 1: The path starts with R.

So, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. That's three R segments and two U segments.

Case 2: The path starts with U.

Segments would be U, R, U, R, U. That's three U segments and two R segments.

So, the number of R segments and U segments depends on whether the path starts with R or U.

In either case, the number of segments is five, so the number of direction changes is four.

Now, the problem is to count all such paths that change direction exactly four times.

So, let's think about how to model this. Each path is a sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's, with the condition that between direction changes, the steps are consecutive in the same direction. And the number of direction changes is four, so five segments.

So, the problem reduces to partitioning the 8 R's into either three or two segments, and the 8 U's into the remaining number of segments, depending on the starting direction.

Wait, let me clarify. If the path starts with R, then the R's will be in three segments, and the U's in two segments. Because the segments alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments.

Similarly, if it starts with U, it's three U segments and two R segments.

So, the total number of such paths is equal to twice the number of paths starting with R, because starting with U would give a symmetrical count.

Alternatively, perhaps not, because the grid is square, but let's check.

So, let's compute the number of paths that start with R, have three R segments and two U segments, and the total number of R steps is 8, U steps is 8.

Similarly, the same count would apply for paths starting with U, so the total would be twice that number.

So, first, let's compute the number of paths starting with R.

How do we compute that? It's the number of ways to partition the 8 R's into three segments and the 8 U's into two segments. Each segment must have at least one step, because a segment can't have zero steps; otherwise, it wouldn't be a segment. So, each R segment has at least one R, and each U segment has at least one U.

So, for the R's: 8 R's into three segments, each at least 1. This is a stars and bars problem. The number of ways to do this is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, for the U's: 8 U's into two segments, each at least 1. So, C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

But wait, we also have to consider the order in which these segments occur. Since the path is a specific sequence of R and U segments, the arrangement is fixed once we decide the starting direction. So, for starting with R, the sequence is R, U, R, U, R. So, the number of such paths is the number of ways to split R's and U's into their respective segments.

So, for R's: 8 R's into three segments, each at least 1: 21 ways.

For U's: 8 U's into two segments, each at least 1:
