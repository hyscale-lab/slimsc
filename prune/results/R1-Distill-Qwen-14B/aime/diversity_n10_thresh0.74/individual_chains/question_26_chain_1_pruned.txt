Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. I need to find the length AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Given lengths are AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. Hmm, so triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me check if it's a valid triangle. Yes, because 5 + 9 > 10, 5 + 10 > 9, and 9 + 10 > 5. So, that's fine.

I remember that in circle geometry, the tangent from a point outside the circle has equal length. So, D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. That means DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω.

I think I can use the Power of a Point theorem here. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the length of the tangent from D to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points of intersection of any secant from D with the circle.

In this case, the tangent lengths are DB and DC, which are equal. So, DB = DC. The secant would be DA, which intersects the circle at A and P. So, the Power of Point D with respect to ω is DB² = DA * DP.

Wait, so DB² = DA * DP. That seems useful. If I can find DB and DA, I can find DP, and then subtract DA to get AP.

But wait, AP is the segment from A to P, so AP = DP - DA? No, wait. Let me think. AD is the line from A to D, and it intersects the circle again at P. So, from A, going through D, the length from A to P is longer than from A to D? No, because usually, a secant from D passes through the circle and goes to P, which is on the other side. Wait, no, actually, AD starts at A, goes through D, but D is outside the circle. So, AD starts at A, exits the circle at P, then goes to D. Wait, no, that can't be. Because the circle is around the triangle ABC, so points B and C are on the circle. The line AD starts at A, which is on the circle, passes through P, which is another point on the circle, then goes to D, which is outside.

Wait, no, hold on. AD connects A to D. Since D is outside the circle, the line AD must pass through the circle at two points: A and another point, which is P. So, actually, the order is A, then P, then D. So, AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, AD = AP + PD. But according to the Power of a Point theorem, DB² = AP * PD.

Wait, no. The Power of a Point formula for a secant is that if a line passes through the circle and intersects it at two points, say X and Y, then for a point outside, the power is equal to the product of the distances from the point to each intersection. So, in this case, D is outside the circle, and the secant is D-P-A (since D is outside, and the secant goes through P and A, but A is on the circle). Hmm, wait, A is on the circle, so the Power of Point D with respect to ω is DB² = DA * DP. Because DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, but since A is on the circle, DA is the length from D to the circle, and DP is the length from D to the other intersection point P. Wait,
