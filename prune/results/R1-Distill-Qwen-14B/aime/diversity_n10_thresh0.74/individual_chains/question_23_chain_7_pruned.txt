Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and diagonals that bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, actually, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me check: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular to each other.

Let me denote the coordinates of the points. Let's say point A is (x, y). Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, point C should be (-x, -y), right? Because diagonals bisect each other, so if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D will be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. Let me denote point B as (p, q), so point D will be (-p, -q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to B to C, C to D, D to A.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to work with vectors or coordinates. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, we can use the property that the product of their slopes is -1.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to use parametric equations for the hyperbola. Let me recall that for hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, the parametric equations are x = a secθ, y = b tanθ. Alternatively, using hyperbolic functions, x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t. Hmm, but maybe using coordinates is easier.

So, let's think about the diagonals. The diagonals are AC and BD. Since AC is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so AC is a line passing through the origin, right? Similarly, BD is from (p, q) to (-p, -q), so BD is another line passing through the origin.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, let's compute the slopes. The slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. Since they are perpendicular, (y/x) * (q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1. So, y q = -x p.

Alternatively, since both diagonals pass through the origin, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

Another approach is to note that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. So, vectors OA and OB (where O is the origin) should satisfy OA · OB = 0, because they are perpendicular. So, OA · OB = 0. OA is the vector from origin to A, which is (x, y), and OB is (p, q). So, their dot product is x p + y q = 0.

So, x p + y q = 0. So, that's one equation.

Now, since points A and C are on the hyperbola, as are B and D.

So, plugging A into hyperbola equation: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Similarly, point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, the lengths of the sides are equal. So, the distance between A
