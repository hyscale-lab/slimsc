Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first because the Asymptote code is a bit confusing. So, there's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me sketch this in my mind. Since the sides are 5, 9, 10, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents from D touch the circle at B and C, so D is the ex-pole with respect to BC.

I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or the ex-tangent point. So, D lies outside the circle, and BD and CD are tangents. Since BD and CD are tangents from the same point D, they should be equal in length. So, BD = CD. That might come in handy.

Now, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at P. So, AP is a secant of the circle. I need to find the length of AP. Since AP is a secant, and AD is a line from A through P, perhaps I can use some power of point theorem.

Wait, the Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the two segments from the point to the circle is equal for any two lines through that point. In this case, D is outside the circle, and the two tangents from D meet the circle at B and C, so the power of D with respect to ω is DB^2 = DC^2 = DP * DA. Because AD is a secant, and DP is the part from D to P, and DA is the entire length from D to A.

So, Power of Point D: DB^2 = DP * DA. So, if I can find DB, I can find DP in terms of DA. But DA is the length from D to A, which I don't know yet. So, perhaps I can express DA in terms of AP.

Wait, AD is the line from A to D, passing through P. So, AD = AP + PD. Wait, no, because P is between A and D, right? So, AP is part of AD, and PD is the other part. So, AD = AP + PD. But from the Power of a Point, DB^2 = DP * DA. So, DB^2 = DP * (AP + DP). Hmm, so if I let AP = x, then PD = AD - x. But I don't know AD yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can find AD first
