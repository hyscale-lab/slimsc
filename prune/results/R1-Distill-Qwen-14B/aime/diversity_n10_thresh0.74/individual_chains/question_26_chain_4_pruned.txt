Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me visualize the problem. We have triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. It's inscribed in a circle ω, so ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, from point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, we draw line AD, which intersects ω again at P. We need to find AP.

I remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle from a common external point, those two tangent segments are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, DB = DC. That might come in handy later.

Another thought: since AD intersects the circumcircle ω again at P, P is the second intersection point, so maybe there's a power of a point involved here. The Power of a Point theorem relates the lengths of segments created by lines intersecting a circle. Specifically, for point D outside the circle ω, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² (since DB is the tangent length). Also, since AD intersects ω at A and P, the power of D is equal to DA * DP. So, I can write that:

DB² = DA * DP.

That equation might be useful because if I can find DA and DB, I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA (wait, actually, no—if AD is extended beyond D to P, then AP is actually AD + DP? Wait, no, hold on. Let me think. Point A is on the circle, so AD is a secant from D passing through A. So, the power of point D with respect to ω is DA * DP = DB².

Wait, the Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside the circle, and a secant line from D passing through the circle at points A and P, then DA * DP = (tangent length)^2. So, yes, DA * DP = DB². So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP because I know DB.

But wait, I don't know DB yet. Hmm. How can I find DB? Well, DB is the length of the tangent from D to ω. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, DB = DC. So, if I can find the distance from D to B, that would be DB. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find DB in terms of other known quantities. Let me think about triangle ABC first. The sides are AB=5,
