Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what the functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. These look like absolute value functions that are nested. Maybe I can graph them or figure out their properties to get a sense of what they do.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's consider the inner absolute value first: |x|. The graph of |x| is a V-shape with its vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2, which shifts the graph down by 1/2. So, the vertex moves to (0, -1/2), but since it's an absolute value, it's actually a V-shape opening upwards. Then taking the absolute value of that, ||x| - 1/2|, so any negative parts would be flipped. Let me think about what this looks like.

When |x| - 1/2 is positive, i.e., when |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. When |x| < 1/2, |x| -1/2 is negative, so the absolute value would make it 1/2 - |x|. So, the function f(x) is a V-shape that has a minimum at x=0, y=1/2, and then it slopes upward on both sides. Wait, no. Let me correct that: the function inside is |x| - 1/2. Taking absolute value of that, so it's the same as the original function but wherever it was negative, it's flipped.

So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| -1/2 is negative, so f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. That's a downward-opening V from x=-1/2 to x=1/2, peaking at (0,1/2). Outside of that, for |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is an upward-opening V. So the graph of f(x) has a peak at (0,1/2) and then it goes down to (1/2,0) and ( -1/2,0), then up again beyond that. So, it's a W-like shape but only symmetric around the y-axis.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's do the same analysis. The inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, so we have |x| - 1/4. Taking absolute value of that: when |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| -1/4. When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. So, the graph of g(x) is a V that's flipped in the middle. It has a peak at (0,1/4), then goes down to (1/4,0) and (-1/4,0), then up again beyond that. So, it's another W-like shape but flatter.

Now, both f and g are these absolute value functions with their own peaks and valleys. So, when we have f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(sin(2πx))), we'll be applying these transformations to the sine function. Similarly for the other function.

Let me think about the composition. First, let's consider the function f(sin(2πx)). So, taking sin(2πx), which has a period of 1, because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so here k=2π, so period is 1. So, sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 1. Then, f is applied to this. Let's think about the range of sin(2πx): it's between -1 and 1.

So, f(sin(2πx)) is || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Let's consider the inner | sin(2πx) |. Since sine is between -1 and 1, | sin(2πx) | is between 0 and 1. Then, subtracting 1/2: so when | sin(2πx) | >= 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = | sin(2πx) | -1/2. When | sin(2πx) | < 1/2, it's 1/2 - | sin(2πx) |.

So, the function f(sin(2πx)) will have a period of 1 as well, since sin(2πx) has period 1. So, it's going to oscillate, but with a different shape. Similarly, g(f(sin(2πx))) would further modify this.

Wait, but y is equal to 4 times g(f(sin(2πx))), so y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's compute what g(f(sin(2πx))) is.

First, f(sin(2
