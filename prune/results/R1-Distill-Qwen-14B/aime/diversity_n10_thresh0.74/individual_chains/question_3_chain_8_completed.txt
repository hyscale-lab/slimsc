Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. Remember, conditional probability is the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred, which is P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, we need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

Wait, but if you win the grand prize, you automatically win a prize, right? Because winning the grand prize means all four numbers match, which is a subset of at least two matching. So, P(A and B) is just P(A), because A is a subset of B. So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

Therefore, we need to compute two probabilities:

1. P(A): The probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. That's the grand prize probability.
2. P(B): The probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. That's the prize probability.

Then, we'll divide P(A) by P(B) to get our answer.

Let me structure this:

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways 4 numbers can be chosen from S. Since S has 10 elements, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4), which is 210.

Next, for P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Since Jen has picked 4 specific numbers, the only way she wins the grand prize is if those exact 4 numbers are chosen. So, there's only one favorable outcome. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. This can be calculated by considering the scenarios where exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen. Alternatively, it's easier to compute 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two numbers chosen (i.e., 0 or 1). So, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

Let me compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

P(0 matches): All four chosen numbers are from the 6 numbers not chosen by Jen. So, the number of ways is C(6,4). So, the probability is C(6,4)/C(10,4).

Similarly, P(1 match): Exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the remaining three are from the other 6. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3). So, the probability is [C(4,1) * C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Let me compute these values:

C(6,4) = 15. So, P(0 matches) = 15/210.

C(4,1) = 4, and C(6,3) = 20. So, P(1 match) = (4 * 20)/210 = 80/210.

So, P(B) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210) = 1 - (95/210) = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me confirm. 15 + 80 is 95, correct. 210 - 95 is 115. So, P(B) = 115/210.

But wait, 115 and 210 can be simplified. Let's see, 115 divides by 5 and 23. 210 divides by 5, 42. So, 115/210 = (23*5)/(42*5) = 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

But wait, let me think again. When I computed P(B), I considered at least two matches, so 115/210. But wait, 115/210 simplifies to 23/42, which is correct.

Wait a second, but when I compute 115/210, that's correct because 210 - 95 is 115. So, that's right.

So, summarizing:

P(A) = 1/210.

P(B) = 115/210 = 23/42.

Therefore, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure.

Wait, another way to think about P(B) is to compute the number of favorable outcomes for B, which is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0). Let's see if that gives the same result.

Compute each term:

C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, total favorable outcomes for B are 115. Since total possible is 210, so P(B) is 115/210, which is same as before. So that's correct.

Therefore, P(A|B) is (1) / 115, because P(A) is 1/210 and P(B) is 115/210, so dividing them cancels the 210, giving 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. Hence, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 115 is 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors. So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Hmm, wait, 115 is 5*23. So, 1 and 115 are coprime, correct. Therefore, the answer is 116.

Alternatively, let me think if I did everything correctly.

Wait, another way to think about P(A|B). Since we know that at least two numbers are matching, what's the probability that all four match, given that at least two match.

Alternatively, in the conditional probability space where at least two numbers match, how likely is it that all four match.

In this scenario, the total number of possible lottery outcomes that have at least two matches with Jen's numbers is 115, as computed earlier. Among these 115, only 1 outcome (the grand prize) is when all four match. So, the conditional probability is 1/115.

Yes, that makes sense. So, I think I did it right.

Just to recap:

Total ways: 210.

Favorable for A: 1.

Favorable for B: 115.

So, P(A|B) = 1/115.

Therefore, m = 1, n = 115, m + n = 116.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( m + n \) is \boxed{116}.


Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

Next, we determine the probability of winning the grand prize, \( P(A) \). There is only one favorable outcome (choosing all four of Jen's numbers), so:
\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \]

To find the probability of winning a prize, \( P(B) \), we consider the scenarios where at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. This can be calculated by subtracting the probabilities of having 0 or 1 matches from 1.

- The probability of 0 matches (all four numbers chosen are from the remaining 6 numbers) is:
  \[ \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} \]

- The probability of 1 match (one number from Jen's 4 and three from the remaining 6) is:
  \[ \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \times 20}{210} = \frac{80}{210} \]

Thus, the probability of having at least two matches is:
\[ P(B) = 1 - \left( \frac{15}{210} + \frac{80}{210} \right) = 1 - \frac{95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \]

The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115} \]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{116}
\]
