Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where we have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers and maybe some formulas that relate circumradius (R), inradius (r), sides of the triangle, and other elements. 

First, I know that in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c by the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle. Also, the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter: r = Δ/s, where s is (a+b+c)/2.

But in this problem, we also have the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. I'm not exactly sure how to approach that, so maybe I should think about the positions of O and I in the triangle.

The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, while the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. For IA to be perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a specific relationship between the sides or angles that can be derived from this condition.

Let me try to visualize this. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the line from A to I is perpendicular to the line from O to I. So, triangle IOA is a right triangle at I. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees.

Wait, so that would mean that in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras' theorem, we have IO² + IA² = OA². But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA = 13. So, IO² + IA² = 13² = 169.

So, if I can find either IO or IA, I can find the other one. But I don't know either of them yet. Maybe I can find expressions for IO and IA in terms of other known quantities.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula IO² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.

Yes, I think that's correct. The formula for the distance between incenter and circumcenter is indeed IO² = R² - 2Rr. Let me check the formula again. Hmm, some other sources say IO² = R² - 2Rr, so yes, that seems right. So in this case, IO² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So IO² is 13, meaning IO is sqrt(13).

Wait, but earlier I thought that in triangle IOA, IO² + IA² = OA². So, substituting, 13 + IA² = 169. So IA² = 156, so IA = sqrt(156). Hmm, okay.

Alternatively, I can use other formulas related to IA. I think the length of the in
