Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. When any single digit in N is changed to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is abcd (where a, b, c, d are digits), then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives abc1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q + R where N = 1000*Q + R.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Let me break it down.

First, since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, we can start checking from 9999 downwards until we find a number that satisfies the condition. But that might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about what it means for each of those modified numbers to be divisible by 7. Each modified number is N with exactly one digit changed to 1. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000w + 100x + 10y + z, where w, x, y, z are digits from 0 to 9, and w ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number.

So, when we change each digit to 1, we get:

1. Changing w to 1: 1000*1 + 100x + 10y + z = 1000 + 100x + 10y + z
2. Changing x to 1: 1000w + 100*1 + 10y + z = 1000w + 100 + 10y + z
3. Changing y to 1: 1000w + 100x + 10*1 + z = 1000w + 100x + 10 + z
4. Changing z to 1: 1000w + 100x + 10y + 1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, let me denote each of these as N1, N2, N3, N4:

N1 = 1000 + 100x + 10y + z ≡ 0 mod 7
N2 = 1000w + 100 + 10y + z ≡ 0 mod 7
N3 = 1000w + 100x + 10 + z ≡ 0 mod 7
N4 = 1000w + 100x + 10y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

We need all four of these conditions to hold.

Perhaps I can express each of these in terms of N. Let me see.

Original N is 1000w + 100x + 10y + z.

N1 is equal to 1000 + 100x + 10y + z. Which can be written as 1000 + (N - 1000w). Because N = 1000w + 100x + 10y + z, so 100x + 10y + z = N - 1000w. Therefore, N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000w) = N - 1000(w - 1). Hmm, maybe not the most helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express each modified number in terms of N and the digit being changed.

Wait, when we change a digit to 1, the difference between N and the modified number is related to the digit that's being changed.

Let me compute N1 - N:

N1 = 1000 + 100x + 10y + z
N = 1000w + 100x + 10y + z
So, N1 - N = 1000 - 1000w = 1000*(1 - w)

Similarly,

N2 = 1000w + 100 + 10y + z
N2 - N = (1000w + 100 + 10y + z) - (1000w + 100x + 10y + z) = 100*(1 - x)

N3 = 1000w + 100x + 10 + z
N3 - N = (1000w + 100x + 10 + z) - (1000w + 100x + 10y + z) = 10*(1 - y)

N4 = 1000w + 100x + 10y + 1
N4 - N = (1000w + 100x + 10y + 1) - (1000w + 100x + 10y + z) = 1 - z

So, we have:

N1 - N = 1000*(1 - w)
N2 - N = 100*(1 - x)
N3 - N = 10*(1 - y)
N4 - N = 1 - z

Now, since N1, N2, N3, N4 are all divisible by 7, and N is some number. So, N1 = 7k1, N2 = 7k2, N3 = 7k3, N4 = 7k4 for some integers k1, k2, k3, k4.

So, N1 = N + (N1 - N) = N + 1000*(1 - w) = 7k1
Similarly,
N2 = N + 100*(1 - x) = 7k2
N3 = N + 10*(1 - y) = 7k3
N4 = N + (1 - z) = 7k4

This suggests that:

N + 1000*(1 - w) ≡ 0 mod 7
N + 100*(1 - x) ≡ 0 mod 7
N + 10*(1 - y) ≡ 0 mod 7
N + (1 - z) ≡ 0 mod 7

Alternatively, since N1 ≡ 0 mod7, N2 ≡0 mod7, etc., and N1 = N + (N1 - N), so:

N + (N1 - N) ≡0 mod7 → (N1 - N) ≡ -N mod7 → but maybe that's not the right way.

Wait, perhaps another approach. If N1 is divisible by 7, then N1 ≡0 mod7. Similarly for N2, N3, N4.

So, N1 ≡0 mod7 → (N + 10
