Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I should probably sketch this out to visualize. But since I can't draw right now, I'll try to imagine it. Points B and C are on the circle, and the tangents at those points meet at D. So D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents from a common external point are equal, so DB = DC, right? So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

AD is a line from A through D, intersecting the circle again at P. So AP is a chord of the circle passing through D.

Given the sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, which is a scalene triangle. Maybe I can find some properties or use some theorems here.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths are equal. So DB = DC. Also, perhaps the power of a point might come into play here. The power of point D with respect to ω would be DB² = DC², which equals DA * DP, since D lies on AD and P is the second intersection point.

Power of a point formula: For a point D outside the circle, the power is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

Yes, that seems right. So if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then AP would be AD - DP or DP - AD, depending on how the points are arranged.

Wait, let's think about the arrangement. Point D is outside the circle. Point A is on the circle. Line AD passes through D and A, then intersects the circle again at P. So the order along AD would be D, then A, then P? Or is it P, A, D? Hmm, depends on where D is relative to A.

Wait, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, and ABC is inscribed in the circle. If I imagine triangle ABC with A opposite BC, then D is probably on the opposite side of BC relative to A. So the line AD would start at A, go through D, and then intersect the circle again at P. Wait, no, because D is outside the circle, so the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes outward, passes through D, and then would have to come back into the circle at P. Wait, but that would mean P is between A and D? No, that can't be because AD starts at A, goes through D, which is outside, so P must be the other intersection point, but wait, A is already on the circle.
