Okay, so I have this geometry problem here with two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. So, ABCD is a rectangle. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is 107, which is the length, and BC is 16, which is the width. So, ABCD has sides 107 and 16.

Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. FG is 17, and EF is 184. So, EFGH has sides 184 and 17. 

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line. Let me think about the positions of these points. Since ABCD is a rectangle, the points are in order A, B, C, D. So, D is one of the corners. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so the points are E, F, G, H. So, E is a corner, F is the next, and so on.

Wait, but D, E, C, F are on a straight line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F. Hmm, so E is somewhere between D and C, or maybe C is between D and F? Wait, not necessarily. I need to figure out the order.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's an important piece of information. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on a single circle. That might help in finding some relationships between the sides or angles.

Let me try to sketch a rough diagram in my mind. ABCD is a rectangle, so A is connected to B, which is connected to C, then to D, and back to A. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, so E is connected to F, F to G, G to H, and H back to E.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, I think the line that passes through D, E, C, F is probably the side DC, but that can't be because EFGH is another rectangle. Hmm, maybe DC is one line, and EF is another line. Wait, but EFGH is a rectangle, so EF is a side of that rectangle, which is 184 units long. So, EF is one side, and FG is 17. So, EF is the longer side.

Wait, but D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E and F are on the same line as D and C. So, perhaps E is on DC, and F is on DC as well? But then, EF would be a segment on DC, but EF is 184, which is longer than DC, which is 16, since BC is 16 and AB is 107. Wait, DC is equal to AB, so DC is 107. Wait, no, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, ABCD has AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16.

So, DC is 107. But EF is 184, which is longer than DC. So, that can't be. So, EF can't be on DC. So, maybe the line D-E-C-F is a different line. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the line is not DC but extending beyond. So, D and C are on this line, and E and F are on this line as well, but perhaps outside the rectangles.

Let me think: ABCD has points A, B, C, D. EFGH has points E, F, G, H. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F. So, maybe the order is D-E-C-F, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, it could be E-D-C-F or C-E-D-F, but I need to figure out the positions.

Wait, since EF is 184, which is a side of the rectangle EFGH, EF is one of the sides. And FG is 17, so the other side is 17. So, EFGH is a rectangle with sides 184 and 17.

So, perhaps EF is a horizontal line, and FG is vertical. Or vice versa, but I'm not sure.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic. So, maybe we can use cyclic quadrilateral properties here.

Let me try to think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help me visualize.

Let me assign coordinates to rectangle ABCD. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since DC is 107 and BC is 16, then point C is at (107, 0). Point B would be at (107, 16), and point A at (0, 16). Wait, no, because AB is 107. Wait, AB is the vertical side, so if AB is 107, then the sides would be AB = 107 (vertical), BC = 16 (horizontal). So, actually, ABCD would be arranged such that AB is vertical, BC is horizontal.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the orientation. Let me think: In rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, BC is adjacent. So, AB could be vertical or horizontal. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I can choose a coordinate system to simplify.

Let me place point D at (0,0). Then, since DC is 107, point C is at (107, 0). Then, BC is 16, so point B is at (107, 16), and point A is at (0, 16). So, AB is 107, which is the vertical side from (0,16) to (0,0), which is 16 units. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if AB is 107, then AB should be 107 units long. But in this case, AB is from (0,16) to (0,0), which is 16 units. That's not correct.

Wait, I think I messed up the assignment. Let's try again. Let's define point A at (0,0). Then, since AB is 10
