Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The circumcenter is O, and the incenter is I. They tell me that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product of AB and AC, which is AB · AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The inradius is the radius of the incircle, which touches all three sides, while the circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle passing through the vertices.

The fact that IA is perpendicular to OI seems important. I remember that in some triangles, especially those with certain symmetries, the incenter and circumcenter can lie along the same line or have particular relationships. But IA being perpendicular to OI... I'm not exactly sure about that. Maybe it's a specific property that can lead to a relation between sides or angles.

I think I should draw a diagram to visualize this. Triangle ABC with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry for this. Let me set up coordinates to model the situation.

Let's place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, the incenter I can be somewhere else. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector from I to A is perpendicular to the vector from O to I.

Wait, if I consider point A, it's somewhere on the circumcircle with radius 13, so OA = 13. The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6. Hmm.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI = √(R(R - 2r))

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me plug in the values:

OI = √(13(13 - 2*6)) = √(13*(13 -12)) = √(13*1) = √13.

So OI is √13. That might be useful later.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. So if I can express IA and OI in vector terms, their dot product should be zero.

Let me denote the coordinates of I as (h, k). Then, since O is at (0,0), the vector OI is (h, k). Point A is on the circumcircle, so OA = 13, so the coordinates of A are (x, y) such that x² + y² = 13² = 169.

The vector IA is from I to A, which is (x - h, y - k). The vector OI is (h, k). Their dot product is zero:

(x - h)*h + (y - k)*k = 0

Which simplifies to:

h(x - h) + k(y - k) = 0

Expanding:

hx - h² + ky - k² = 0

Or:

hx + ky = h² + k²

But since OI is √(h² + k²) = √13, then h² + k² = 13. So:

hx + ky = 13

But we also know that point A lies on the circumcircle: x² + y² = 169.

Hmm, so we have two equations:

1. hx + ky = 13
2. x² + y² = 169

This seems like a system of equations we can work with. Maybe we can parameterize point A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some trigonometric relationships. Let me think about the triangle. The inradius r is 6, so area is r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter. The area is also (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides, and R is the circumradius.

Wait, so area = r*s = 6s, and also area = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52. So 6s = (a*b*c)/52, which implies a*b*c = 312s.

Hmm, that might come into play later. But I don't know s yet, the semi-perimeter.

Wait, I need to find AB · AC. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. So AB · AC = b*c.

But maybe I can express this in terms of other variables.

I also recall that in a triangle, the product AB · AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Specifically, in triangle ABC, the area is (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A. So, area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

But I also know the area is equal to r*s, which is 6s. So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

Hmm, but I don't know angle A. Maybe using the Law of Sines would help? Law of Sines says that a/(sin A) = 2R = 26. So sin A = a/(26).

Substituting that into the area expression:

6s = (1/2)*b*c*(a/26) = (a*b*c)/(52).

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 → a*b*c = 312s.

Wait, I think I wrote that earlier. So that's consistent.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Maybe I can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use coordinates more effectively. Let me think about point A.

We have point A on the circumcircle, and the inradius is 6. The inradius is the distance from the incenter I to each side, but how does that relate to the coordinates?

Alternatively, maybe I can express the inradius in terms of the sides. The formula for the inradius is r = area / s, where s is the semi-perimeter. So, 6 = area / s → area = 6s.

Wait, we already used that earlier.

Another approach: Maybe using the formula that relates OI, R, r, and the distance between the centers. I think that's the formula I used earlier to get OI = √13.

But I also have the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, let me think geometrically. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then perhaps triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at A? Wait, no, because IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning the two vectors are perpendicular, so the triangle IAO is right-angled at I. Or is it?

Wait, no. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So, the triangle formed by points O, I, and A is a right triangle with legs OI and IA, and hypotenuse OA.

Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13.

So, OA = 13, OI = √13, IA = ?

Using Pythagoras in triangle OIA:

OA² = OI² + IA²

13² = (√13)² + IA²

169 = 13 + IA²

IA² = 169 -13 = 156 → IA = √156 = 2√39.

Hmm, so the length of IA is 2√39.

But the inradius is 6. Wait, in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex isn't necessarily the same as the inradius. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to the sides, not to the vertices. So IA is different.

But in this case, IA is 2√39, which is about 12.49, which is longer than the circumradius of 13. Wait, that seems possible because IA is from the incenter to vertex A, which is different from the inradius.

But how can I use this information?

I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.

The formula for the length of IA is:

IA = √(r^2 + (s - a)^2)

Where r is the inradius, s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC.

Similarly, IB and IC have similar expressions.

So, IA = √(r² + (s - a)^2) = √(6² + (s - a)^2) = √(36 + (s - a)^2) = 2√39.

So, squaring both sides:

36 + (s - a)^2 = (2√39)^2 = 4 * 39 = 156.

So, (s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120 → s - a = √120 = 2√30.

So, s - a = 2√30.

But s is the semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, s - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (-a + b + c)/2 = (b + c - a)/2.

So, (b + c - a)/2 = 2√30 → b + c - a = 4√30.

Hmm, interesting. So, that's one equation.

I need another equation to relate these variables. Let's see.

I also know that the area is 6s, and from the Law of Sines, the sides can be expressed in terms of angles.

Wait, another formula: The distance from the inradius to the vertex can also be expressed using trigonometric identities. For IA, it's given by:

IA = r / sin(A/2)

Wait, is that right? Let me think.

In a triangle, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is IA. The formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me confirm that.

Yes, I think that's correct. Because in the inradius, the angle bisector from A to I makes an angle of A/2, and the distance IA can be found using trigonometric relations.

So, IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39.

So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39 → sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = √39 / 13.

Wait, because 3 / √39 simplifies to √39 / 13 because 3/√39 = 3√39 / 39 = √39 / 13.

So, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13.

Then, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169 → cos(A/2) = √130 /13.

So, cos(A/2) = √130 /13.

Now, knowing that, perhaps I can find the sides in terms of angles.

From the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A = 26 sin A.

Similarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

But since I know sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), maybe I can find sin A.

Using the double-angle formula:

sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(√39/13)*(√130/13) = 2*(√(39*130))/169.

Calculating √(39*130): 39*130 = 5070. Hmm, 5070 factors into 10 * 507, which is 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13². So, √5070 = √(10 * 3 * 13²) = 13 * √30.

So, sin A = 2*(13√30)/169 = (26√30)/169 = (2√30)/13.

So, sin A = 2√30 /13.

Then, a = 26 sin A = 26*(2√30 /13) = 4√30.

So, side a (BC) is 4√30.

Now, from earlier, we have b + c - a = 4√30 → b + c - 4√30 = 4√30 → b + c = 8√30.

So, b + c = 8√30.

But I need to find b*c.

Wait, another formula: In a triangle, (b + c)^2 = b² + c² + 2bc.

If I can find b² + c², then I can find bc.

But I also know that the sides are related through the Law of Cosines.

Wait, Law of Cosines says a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A.

We know a = 4√30, so a² = 16*30 = 480.

So, 480 = b² + c² - 2bc cos A.

Hmm, I need to find cos A.

From earlier, we found sin A = 2√30 /13, so cos A = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169) = sqrt(1 - 120/169) = sqrt(49/169) = 7/13.

So, cos A = 7/13.

So, Law of Cosines becomes:

480 = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13).

Let me rearrange this:

b² + c² = 480 + (14/13) bc.

But we also have (b + c)^2 = b² + c² + 2bc = (8√30)^2 = 64*30 = 1920.

So, expanding (b + c)^2 = 1920,

b² + c² + 2bc = 1920.

But from above, b² + c² = 480 + (14/13) bc.

Substitute into this equation:

480 + (14/13) bc + 2bc = 1920.

Combine like terms:

480 + (14/13 + 2) bc = 1920.

Convert 2 to 26/13 to have a common denominator:

14/13 + 26/13 = 40/13.

So,

480 + (40/13) bc = 1920.

Subtract 480 from both sides:

(40/13) bc = 1920 - 480 = 1440.

Multiply both sides by 13/40:

bc = 1440 * (13/40) = 36 *13 = 468.

So, bc = 468.

But wait, bc is AB · AC since I denoted AB = c and AC = b. So, AB · AC = 468.

Hmm, but let me double-check my steps because that seems a bit straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, I found that a = 4√30, which is BC. Then, from the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI, I used the right triangle OIA to find IA = 2√39, then using IA = r / sin(A/2), I found sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), then used that to find sin A, then a.

From there, using the Law of Cosines and the relation b + c, I set up equations and found bc = 468.

That seems correct. Let me just check the step where I used IA = r / sin(A/2). I think that formula is correct because in the inradius formulas, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is indeed IA = r / sin(A/2). So, that step seems right.

Also, the calculations for sin A, which becomes 2√30 /13, leading to a = 4√30, that all checks out.

Then, using Law of Cosines and the relation from (b + c)^2, I found bc = 468.

So, I think the answer is 468.


To solve the problem, we start by noting the given information: triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has circumradius \( R = 13 \), inradius \( r = 6 \), and \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:
   Using the formula \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} \), we calculate:
   \[
   OI = \sqrt{13(13 - 12)} = \sqrt{13} \cdot 1 = \sqrt{13}.
   \]

2. **Right Triangle \( \triangle OIA \)**:
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( \triangle OIA \) is a right triangle with \( OA = 13 \) and \( OI = \sqrt{13} \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2 \implies IA^2 + 13 = 169 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}.
   \]

3. **Expression for \( IA \)**:
   The length \( IA \) can also be expressed as \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \). Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):
   \[
   2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
   \]
   Using \( \sin^2(A/2) + \cos^2(A/2) = 1 \):
   \[
   \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}.
   \]

4. **Finding \( \sin A \)**:
   Using the double-angle identity:
   \[
   \sin A = 2\sin(A/2)\cos(A/2) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}.
   \]

5. **Length of Side \( a \)**:
   Using the Law of Sines:
   \[
   a = 2R \cdot \sin A = 26 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}.
   \]

6. **Relating \( b \) and \( c \)**:
   Using the relation \( b + c - a = 4\sqrt{30} \) (derived from \( s - a = 2\sqrt{30} \)):
   \[
   b + c = 8\sqrt{30}.
   \]

7. **Using Law of Cosines**:
   With \( \cos A = \frac{7}{13} \) (from \( \sin A = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \)):
   \[
   a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{7}{13}.
   \]
   Substituting \( a = 4\sqrt{30} \) and \( a^2 = 480 \):
   \[
   480 = b^2 + c^2 - \frac{14}{13}bc.
   \]

8. **Solving for \( bc \)**:
   From \( (b + c)^2 = 1920 \):
   \[
   b^2 + c^2 + 2bc = 1920.
   \]
   Substituting \( b^2 + c^2 = 480 + \frac{14}{13}bc \):
   \[
   480 + \frac{14}{13}bc + 2bc = 1920 \implies \frac{40}{13}bc = 1440 \implies bc = 468.
   \]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 468 \).

\[
\boxed{468}
\]
