Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, Alice picks a set A. Then Bob considers all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such B's is 2024. I need to find the sum of elements in A.

Let me think about what Bob is listing. For each element a in A, Bob can form sets B where the maximum is a. The number of such sets B would be all subsets of the positive integers where the maximum is a. But wait, actually, the elements of B are positive integers, but the set B must have a maximum element a, and all other elements of B must be less than a.

Wait, but B is a finite non-empty set of positive integers with maximum in A. So for each a in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because the maximum is a, and the other elements can be any combination of the numbers less than a. But wait, since B is a finite set, each element is unique, so for each a, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}.

Because for each a, the other elements in B can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}. The number of subsets is 2^{a-1}, but we need to exclude the empty set because B must be non-empty. Wait, no. Wait, when the maximum is a, each B is formed by choosing any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} and then adding a to it. So the number of such B's for each a is exactly 2^{a-1}.

Wait, let's think. For a given a, the sets B with maximum a are exactly the sets where a is included and all other elements are less than a. So the number of such sets is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, which is 2^{a-1}. Because each element can be either included or excluded, except that a must be included.

So for each a in A, the number of sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Therefore, the total number of sets Bob lists is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

And this sum is given as 2024. So we have:

Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024

We need to find the sum of elements of A, which is Sum_{a ∈ A} a.

Let me denote S = Sum_{a ∈ A} a, and T = Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

So the question reduces to finding S given that T = 2024.

What do we know about T? It's a sum of powers of 2. Since each term is 2^{a-1}, and a is a positive integer, the terms are 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., each term double the previous.

Wait, but the exponents are based on the elements of A. So if A has elements like 1, 2, 3, then T would be 2^{0} + 2^{1} + 2^{2} = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

But in our case, T is 2024. So maybe A is a set where the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A is 2024.

I need to find A such that Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024, and then find Sum_{a in A} a.

Wait, perhaps A is a set of consecutive integers starting from 1? Let's see.

Suppose A = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}. Then T = Sum_{k=1}^n 2^{k-1} = 2^n - 1. Because it's a geometric series.

So if T = 2024, then 2^n - 1 = 2024 → 2^n = 2025.

But 2025 is 45^2, which is 3^4 * 5^2. 2^n is a power of two, so 2025 isn't a power of two. So A isn't the set {1, 2, ..., n}.

So A must not be a set of consecutive integers. Then, perhaps A is a subset where the sum of 2^{a-1} equals 2024.

Wait, 2024 in binary might help. Let's convert 2024 into binary.

2024 divided by 2 is 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2= 506, rem 0.

506/2=253, rem 0.

253/2=126 rem 1.

126/2=63 rem 0.

63/2=31 rem 1.

31/2=15 rem 1.

15/2=7 rem 1.

7/2=3 rem 1.

3/2=1 rem 1.

1/2=0 rem 1.

So writing the remainders from last to first:

11111101000.

Wait, let me count the bits: Let's compute 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048, which is bigger than 2024.

So 2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + ... Wait, let's see:

2024:

2024 - 1024 = 1000

1000 - 512 = 488

488 - 256 = 232

232 - 128 = 104

104 - 64 = 40

40 - 32 = 8

8 - 8 = 0

So 2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8.

Which corresponds to the binary bits set at positions 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3 (since 8 is 2^3). So the binary representation is 11111101000, which is 11 bits.

So in binary, it's 11111101000. So the bits are set at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3 (counting from 0 on the right). So that's 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. So in terms of exponents, each set bit corresponds to 2^k.

But in our case, T = Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So 2024 = 2^{a1-1} + 2^{a2-1} + ... where each a is in A and all are distinct.

So each term in the sum corresponds to a bit set in 2024's binary representation, but shifted by 1.

Wait, for example, if 2024 has a bit set at position k, then that corresponds to 2^k, which would be equal to 2^{a-1} for some a. Therefore, a-1 = k → a = k+1.

So if 2024's binary representation has bits set at positions k1, k2, ..., then the set A would be {k1 + 1, k2 + 1, ...}.

Wait, let's see. Let me re-express:

If 2024 = Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1},

then each a ∈ A corresponds to a bit in 2024's binary representation, but with the exponent being a-1.

So for each bit set in 2024 at position m (where the rightmost is 0), we have a term 2^m. Thus, the corresponding a is m + 1.

So the set A is all numbers of the form (m + 1), where m is a position where the binary digit of 2024 is 1.

So since 2024 is 11111101000 in binary, which is 11 bits long, the positions with 1s are:

Starting from the right, position 3: 8 (2^3)

Then positions 5,6,7,8,9,10: bits are 1s.

Wait, let me write the binary: 11111101000.

Let's count the bits starting from the right as positions 0,1,2,...

So:

Position 10: 1

9:1

8:1

7:1

6:1

5:1

4:0

3:1

2:0

1:0

0:0

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the binary is 11111101000.

Let me write it down:

Positions (from right, starting at 0):

Position 10: 1

9:1

8:1

7:1

6:1

5:1

4:0

3:1

2:0

1:0

0:0

Wait, I think I got that wrong. Wait, the binary number is 11111101000.

Let me write it as:

1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

From left to right, but the leftmost is the highest bit.

Wait, but when I write it as a string, the leftmost is the highest position.

So 11111101000 is 11 bits:

Positions 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Bits:        1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

So the 1s are at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Therefore, the exponents a-1 are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Therefore, the a's are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

So the elements of A are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Now, the sum of the elements of A is 4 + 6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11.

Let me compute that:

4 +6 =10

10 +7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

So the sum is 55.

Wait a second, let me double-check the calculation:

4 +6 =10

10 +7=17

17 +8=25

25 +9=34

34 +10=44

44 +11=55.

Yes, 55.

So the sum of the elements of A is 55.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any bits.

2024 in binary is 11111101000.

So the positions with 1s are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So a-1 =10 → a=11

a-1=9→a=10

a-1=8→a=9

a-1=7→a=8

a-1=6→a=7

a-1=5→a=6

a-1=3→a=4.

So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, correct.

So sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.

So the answer should be 55.

But wait, let me check if T is indeed 2024.

Compute Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1}.

So for a=4: 2^{3}=8

a=6: 2^5=32

a=7: 2^6=64

a=8: 2^7=128

a=9: 2^8=256

a=10:2^9=512

a=11:2^{10}=1024.

Now sum these: 8 +32=40; 40+64=104; 104+128=232; 232+256=488; 488+512=1000; 1000 +1024=2024.

Yes, correct. So that's correct.

So the sum of the elements of A is 55.


Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers where the maximum element of $B$ is in $A$. The total number of such sets is 2024. For each element $a$ in $A$, the number of sets $B$ with maximum $a$ is $2^{a-1}$. Thus, the sum of $2^{a-1}$ over all $a \in A$ equals 2024. Converting 2024 to binary gives $11111101000_2$, which corresponds to the set $A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}$. The sum of the elements of $A$ is $4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55$.

$\boxed{55}$
