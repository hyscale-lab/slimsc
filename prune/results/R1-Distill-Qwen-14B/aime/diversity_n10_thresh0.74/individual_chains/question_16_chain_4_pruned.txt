Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I have to find the smallest m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for primes, certain conditions have to be met for equations like n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2. Maybe I should start by looking at small primes and see if they satisfy the condition where n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2. The least prime p is what I'm after, so starting with the smallest primes makes sense.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. I can check each one to see if there's an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2.

Starting with p=2. Let's see: n^4 +1 mod 4. Let's try n=1: 1 +1=2, which mod 4 is 2, not 0. n=2: 16 +1=17 mod 4 is 1. n=3: 81 +1=82 mod4= 82-80=2. So it's never 0 mod4. So p=2 doesn't work because there's no n where n^4 +1 is divisible by 4.

Next, p=3. We need n^4 ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n^4 mod9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod9 has residues 0-8):

n=1: 1^4=1 mod9=1
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: 256 mod9. Let's see, 256 /9: 28*9=252, so 256-252=4. So 4^4=256≡4 mod9.
n=5: 5^4=625. 625/9: 69*9=621, so 625-621=4. So 5^4≡4 mod9.
n=6: 6^4=1296. 1296 is 144*9, so 0 mod9.
n=7: 7^4=2401. Let's compute 2401 mod9. Sum the digits: 2+4+0+1=7, which is 7 mod9.
n=8: 8^4=4096. Sum digits:4+0+9+6=19→1+9=10→1+0=1. So 4096≡1 mod9.

So looking for n^4 ≡ -1 mod9. Since -1 mod9 is 8. So is any of the above residues 8? Let's see:

n=1:1, n=2:7, n=3:0, n=4:4, n=5:4, n=6:0, n=7:7, n=8:1. No, none are 8. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next prime: p=5. Let's check if there exists n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod25.

Compute n^4 mod25. Let's try n from 1 to 24, but that's a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way.

I remember that for modulus p^2, if n^k ≡ -1 mod p, then maybe Hensel's lemma can be used. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe check if -1 is a quartic residue mod5^2.

First, let's see mod5. Does n^4 ≡ -1 mod5 have a solution?

Compute n^4 mod5 for n=1,2,3,4:

n=1:1
n=2:16 mod5=1
n=3:81 mod5=1
n=4:256 mod5=1
n=0:0.

So all n not divisible by 5 have n^4 ≡1 mod5. So -1 mod5 is 4. So n^4 ≡4 mod5? But from above, n^4 mod5 is always 0 or 1. So n^4 ≡4 mod5 is impossible. Therefore, there's no solution for n^4 ≡-1 mod5, so p=5 can't be such a prime either.

Wait, that's a key point. If n^4 ≡-1 modp has no solution, then certainly n^4≡-1 modp² won't have a solution.

So for p=5, since n^4 ≡-1 mod5 has no solution, p=5 is out.

Next prime: p=7.

Check if n^4 ≡-1 mod7 has a solution.

Compute n^4 mod7 for n=1,2,3,4,5,6.

n=1:1
n=2:16 mod7=2
n=3:81 mod7. 7*11=77, 81-77=4
n=4:256 mod7. Let me compute 4^2=16 mod7=2, 4^4=(4^2)^2=2^2=4 mod7.
n=5: same as n=5 mod7. Let's compute 5^2=25 mod7=4, so 5^4=(5^2)^2=4^2=16 mod7=2.
n=6: same as n=-1. (-1)^4=1 mod7.

So residues are: n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:4, n=4:4, n=5:2, n=6:1.

So looking for n^4 ≡-1 mod7, which is 6. Do any residues equal 6? No, since the residues are 1,2,4,4,2,1. So no solution mod7. Therefore, p=7 is out.

Next prime: p=11.

Let me check if n^4 ≡-1 mod11 has a solution.

Compute n^4 mod11 for n=1 to 10.

n=1:1
n=2:16 mod11=5
n=3:81 mod11. 11*7=77, 81-77=4
n=4:256 mod11. Let's compute 4^2=16 mod11=5, 4^4=5^2=25 mod11=3
n=5:625 mod11. Let's compute 5 mod11=5, 5^2=25 mod11=3, 5^4=3^2=9 mod11.
n=6:6^4. 6^2=36 mod11=3, 6^4=3^2=9 mod11.
n=7:7^4. 7^2=49 mod11=5, 7^4=5^2=25 mod11=3.
n=8:8^4. 8 mod11=8, 8^2=64 mod11=9, 8^4=9^2=81 mod11=4.
n=9:9^4. 9^2=81 mod11=4, 9^4=4^2=16 mod11=5.
n=10:10^4= (10^2)^2=100^2. 100 mod11=1, so 1^2=1 mod11.

So n^4 mod11 gives residues: 1,5,4,3,9,9,3,4,5,1.

Looking for n^4 ≡-1 mod11 which is 10. So does any residue equal 10? No. So p=11 doesn't work.

Next prime: p=13.

Check if n^4 ≡-1 mod13 has a solution.

Compute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to 12.

n=1:1
n=2:16 mod13=3
n=3:81 mod13. 13*6=78, 81-78=3
n=4:256 mod13. Let's compute 4^2=16 mod13=3, 4^4=3^2=9 mod13.
n=5:5^4. 5^2=25 mod13=12, 5^4=12^2=144 mod13=1.
n=6:6^4. 6^2=36 mod13=10, 6^4=10^2=100 mod13=9.
n=7:7^4. 7^2=49 mod13=10, 7^4=10^2=100 mod13=9.
n=8:8^4. 8^2=64 mod13=12, 8^4=12^2=144 mod13=1.
n=9:9^4. 9^2=81 mod13=3, 9^4=3^2=9 mod13.
n=10:10^4. 10^2=100 mod13=9, 10^4=9^2=81 mod13=3.
n=11:11^4. 11^2=121 mod13=4, 11^4=4^2=16 mod13=3.
n=12:12^4. 12^2=144 mod13=1, 12^4=1^2=1 mod13.

So residues are: 1,3,3,9,1,9,9,1,9,3,3,1.

Looking for n^4 ≡-1 mod13. Since -1 mod13 is 12. Do any residues equal 12? No. So p=13 is out.

Next prime: p=17.

Wait, this might take a while. Perhaps there's a better approach. Maybe the primes where -1 is a quartic residue. Oh, I remember that for p ≡1 mod8, the equation x^4 ≡-1 modp can have solutions. Because the multiplicative group modp is cyclic of order p-1, and if 8 divides p-1, then the group has elements of order 8, so x^4 can be -1.

But for p=17, p-1=16, which is not 1 mod8—it's 0 mod8. Wait, 16 is 0 mod8. Hmm, maybe only primes where 8 divides p-1? Let's see, for p=17, p-1=16=8*2. So 8 divides p-1.

Wait, but earlier primes like p=17, let's check if n^4≡-1 mod17 has a solution.

Let me compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 16.

n=1:1
n=2:16 mod17=16
n=3:81 mod17. 17*4=68, 81-68=13
n=4:256 mod17. 17*15=255, 256-255=1.
n=5:625 mod17. Let's compute 625/17: 17*36=612, 625-612=13.
n=6:6^4=1296 mod17. 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4.
n=7:7^4=2401 mod17. Let's compute 2401 /17: 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4.
n=8:8^4=4096 mod17. 17*241=4097, so 4096 mod17= -1 mod17=16.
Ah! So n=8:8^4 mod17=16, which is -1 mod17. So yes, n=8 is a solution mod17. So p=17 is a candidate.

Wait, but before I jump to conclusions, I need to check if p=17 is indeed the least prime for which there exists an n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by p squared, which is 289.

Wait, but p=17 is the first prime where n^4 ≡-1 modp has a solution. So maybe p
