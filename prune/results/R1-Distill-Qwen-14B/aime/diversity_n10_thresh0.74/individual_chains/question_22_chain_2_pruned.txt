Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the hexagon. It's convex and equilateral, so all sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel, which probably means it's similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or something. Since it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. That triangle must be larger than the hexagon itself. Let me denote the hexagon as ABCDEF, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB || CD || EF and BC || DE || FA.

Wait, but it's an equilateral hexagon, so each side has the same length, say 's'. But opposite sides are not only parallel but also equally spaced? Or maybe not necessarily equally spaced, but arranged in a way that the hexagon can be inscribed in a larger triangle.

Let me think about the triangle. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. So, AB is one side of the hexagon, CD is another, and EF is another. When extended, these lines meet to form a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300. Maybe this triangle is similar to the hexagon's structure.

Wait, perhaps using similar triangles? Since the hexagon is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides could be part of similar triangles within the larger triangle.

I remember that in such hexagons, each side can be thought of as a portion of the larger triangle's sides. Maybe each side of the hexagon is a certain ratio of the corresponding side of the triangle.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. So, the sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA are all length 's'.

But how does the hexagon relate to the larger triangle? Maybe the hexagon is like a smaller similar figure inside the triangle, but with its sides parallel to the outer triangle.

Wait, but the
