Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q, and find p + q. Hmm, okay.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area (SA) is given by SA = 2(ab + bc + ac), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides. The volume (V) is V = abc. So in this case, SA is 54 and V is 23.

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to enclose the box entirely, so the diameter of the sphere has to be equal to the longest distance inside the box, which is the space diagonal.

The space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box is given by d = sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is d/2. So, r = sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2. Therefore, r squared would be (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, the key here is to find the minimal value of (a² + b² + c²) given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23. Then, take that minimal value, divide by 4, and that's r².

Hmm, so I need to minimize a² + b² + c² subject to the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

This sounds like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that Lagrange multipliers are a method for this, but since it's a problem with three variables and two constraints, maybe it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can express two variables in terms of the third and then find the minimal value.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of symmetric variables—assuming that a, b, c are all equal? Wait, but if a = b = c, the box is a cube. Let me check if that's possible.

If a = b = c, then SA would be 6a² = 54 => a² = 9 => a = 3. Then volume would be a³ = 27, but the problem states volume is 23. So, it's not a cube. Therefore, the minimal sphere might not correspond to a cube, but perhaps a box that's more cube-like than others.

Wait, I think that for a given volume, the cube has the minimal surface area. Hmm, but in this problem, the surface area is fixed, and the volume is given. So, I'm not sure if the cube is the one with the minimal space diagonal. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps using inequalities. I know that for positive real numbers a, b, c, there are inequalities relating sums, products, etc. For example, from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, or AM ≥ GM.

Wait, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)² and ab + bc + ac.

Because (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ac). And since ab + bc + ac is given as 54/2 = 27, because 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, so ab + bc + ac = 27.

So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2*27 = (a + b + c)^2 - 54.

Therefore, to minimize a² + b² + c², I need to minimize (a + b + c)^2, which is equivalent to minimizing a + b + c.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing a + b + c, given that ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

Hmm, okay. So, how can I find the minimum of a + b + c given these constraints?

I remember that for positive real numbers a, b, c, with fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the expression a + b + c can be minimized when a, b, c are as equal as possible. But not sure if that's always the case.

Alternatively, perhaps using the AM ≥ GM inequality. The arithmetic mean of a, b, c is (a + b + c)/3, and the geometric mean is (abc)^(1/3). So, (a + b + c)/3 ≥ (23)^(1/3). Hmm, but that gives a lower bound on a + b + c, but I don't know if it's achievable.

Wait, but maybe the minimal a + b + c is when a, b, c are all equal, but that's only possible when abc is a cube. Since 23 is not a perfect cube, maybe the minimal a + b + c is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set up equations using Lagrange multipliers. Let me try that.

Let me consider the function to minimize: f(a, b, c) = a + b + c.

Subject to two constraints:
g1(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac - 27 = 0
g2(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0

So, using Lagrange multipliers, we set up the equations:

∇f = λ∇g1 + μ∇g2

Which gives:

1 = λ(b + c) + μ(bc)
1 = λ(a + c) + μ(ac)
1 = λ(a + b) + μ(ab)

So, three equations:

1) λ(b + c) + μ(bc) = 1
2) λ(a + c) + μ(ac) = 1
3) λ(a + b) + μ(ab) = 1

Hmm, okay. Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

[λ(a + c) + μ(ac)] - [λ(b + c) + μ(bc)] = 0

Simplify:

λ(a - b) + μ c(a - b) = 0

Factor (a - b):

(λ + μ c)(a - b) = 0

So, either a = b, or λ + μ c = 0.

Similarly, subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

[λ(a + b) + μ(ab)] - [λ(b + c) + μ(bc)] = 0

Simplify:

λ(a - c) + μ b(a - c) = 0

Factor (a - c):

(λ + μ b)(a - c) = 0

So, either a = c, or λ + μ b = 0.

Now, if a = b and a = c, then a = b = c, which is the cube case. But as we saw earlier, that would give abc = a^3 = 23, so a = cube root of 23 ≈ 2.84, and ab + bc + ac = 3a^2 = 27 ⇒ a^2 = 9 ⇒ a = 3, which is inconsistent because cube root of 23 isn't 3. So, a = b = c is not a solution here, because the constraints can't be satisfied simultaneously.

Therefore, the other possibility is that λ + μ c = 0 and λ + μ b = 0. So:

λ + μ c = 0
λ + μ b = 0

Subtracting these two:

μ (c - b) = 0

So, either μ = 0 or c = b.

If μ = 0, then from equation 1: λ(b + c) = 1.

Similarly, from equation 2: λ(a + c) = 1.

So, λ(b + c) = λ(a + c) ⇒ b + c = a + c ⇒ a = b.

Similarly, from equation 3: λ(a + b) =1.

But if a = b, then from equation 1: λ(b + c) = 1 and equation 3: λ(2a) =1.

So, from equation 3: λ = 1/(2a).

Substitute into equation 1:

(1/(2a))(a + c) = 1 ⇒ (a + c)/(2a) = 1 ⇒ a + c = 2a ⇒ c = a.

So, then a = b = c, which brings us back to the cube case, which we saw is impossible because it doesn't satisfy the volume. So, μ can't be zero.

Therefore, the other possibility is that c = b.

So, from earlier, if c = b, then from equation 1 and equation 2, subtracting gives a = c.

Wait, no. Let's see:

If c = b, let's plug into equations.

From equation 1: λ(b + c) + μ(bc) = λ(2b) + μ(b²) =1

From equation 2: λ(a + c) + μ(ac) = λ(a + b) + μ(ab) =1

From equation 3: λ(a + b) + μ(ab) =1

So, equations 2 and 3 become the same equation.

So, equations 1 and 2/3 are:

Equation 1: 2λ b + μ b² =1

Equation 2: λ(a + b) + μ a b =1

Now, let me write them as:

1) 2λ b + μ b² =1

2) λ(a + b) + μ a b =1

Let me try to solve these two equations for λ and μ.

From equation 1: 2λ b =1 - μ b² ⇒ λ = [1 - μ b²]/(2b)

Substitute into equation 2:

[ (1 - μ b²)/(2b) ] (a + b) + μ a b =1

Multiply through:

[ (1 - μ b²)(a + b) ]/(2b) + μ a b = 1

Multiply both sides by 2b to eliminate denominator:

(1 - μ b²)(a + b) + 2 μ a b² = 2b

Expand the first term:

(a + b) - μ b²(a + b) + 2 μ a b² = 2b

Now, group the terms with μ:

- μ b²(a + b) + 2 μ a b² + (a + b) = 2b

Factor μ:

μ [ -b²(a + b) + 2 a b² ] + (a + b) = 2b

Simplify inside the brackets:

- b² a - b³ + 2 a b² = ( - a b² - b³ + 2 a b² ) = ( a b² - b³ ) = b²(a - b)

So, now the equation becomes:

μ [ b²(a - b) ] + (a + b) = 2b

Then, solve for μ:

μ [ b²(a - b) ] = 2b - (a + b) = b - a

So,

μ = (b - a) / [ b²(a - b) ] = -(a - b)/[ b²(a - b) ] = -1 / b²

So, μ = -1 / b²

Now, substitute back into λ:

λ = [1 - μ b² ] / (2b ) = [1 - (-1/b²) b² ] / (2b ) = [1 + 1 ] / (2b ) = 2/(2b) = 1/b

So, λ = 1/b, μ = -1 / b²

Now, let's remember that we have constraints:

ab + bc + ac = 27

But since c = b (from earlier), this becomes:

ab + b² + ab = 27 ⇒ 2ab + b² =27

Similarly, volume constraint: abc =23. Since c = b, this becomes a b² =23 ⇒ a=23/(b²)

So, let's substitute a =23/(b²) into the surface area equation:

2*(23/(b²))*b + b² =27

Simplify:

2*(23 / b) + b² =27 ⇒ 46/b + b² =27

Multiply both sides by b to eliminate denominator:

46 + b³ =27b

Rearranged:

b³ -27b +46 =0

So, we need to solve cubic equation: b³ -27b +46=0

Let me try to factor this.

Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Test b=2: 8 -54 +46= 0. 8-54= -46, +46=0. So, yes, b=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (b - 2)(b² + 2b -23)=0

Because:

(b - 2)(b² + 2b -23) = b³ +2b² -23b - 2b² -4b +46 = b³ -27b +46. Which matches.

So, the roots are b=2, and roots of b² +2b -23=0.

Solve b² +2b -23=0:

b = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

So, possible real positive roots for b are b=2, b= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈3.898, and b= -1 -2√6 which is negative, so we can ignore.

So, possible b values are 2 and approximately 3.898.

Now, check if these are minima.

But let's see, since the problem is about the minimal r, which is the minimal space diagonal. So, we need to find which b gives the minimal a² + b² + c².

But let's consider each case.

Case 1: b=2

Then, from a =23/(b²) → a=23/(4)=5.75

c = b=2

So, a=5.75, b=2, c=2.

Compute a² + b² + c² = (5.75)^2 + 2^2 +2^2= 33.0625 +4 +4=41.0625

Case 2: b= -1 +2√6 ≈3.898

Compute a =23/(b²)

First, compute b²: ( -1 +2√6 )^2 = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2 =1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6 ≈25-9.798≈15.202

So, a=23/(25 -4√6 )

To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

a=23*(25 +4√6 ) / [ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ] =23*(25 +4√6 ) / (625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6 )/(625-96)=23*(25 +4√6 )/529

Simplify:

23 and 529: 529=23², so 23/529=1/23

So, a= (25 +4√6 )/23

So, a≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513

So, a≈1.513, b≈3.898, c=b≈3.898

Compute a² + b² + c²:

a²≈(1.513)^2≈2.289

b²≈(3.898)^2≈15.193

c² same as b²≈15.193

Total≈2.289 +15.193 +15.193≈32.675

So, in case 2, a² + b² + c²≈32.675, which is less than case 1's 41.0625.

So, case 2 gives a smaller sum, so it's better for our purpose.

Therefore, the minimal a + b + c occurs when b= -1 +2√6 and a=(25 +4√6 )/23.

Wait, but let me confirm if that's indeed the minimal. Because the cubic equation had two positive roots, one at 2 and another at approximately 3.898.

So, when b=2, a=5.75, c=2 → a² + b² + c²≈41.06

When b≈3.898, a≈1.513, c≈3.898 → a² + b² + c²≈32.675.

So, 32.675 is smaller, so that's our minimum.

Therefore, the minimal a² + b² + c² is approximately 32.675, but we need exact value.

So, let's compute the exact value.

We had a=(25 +4√6)/23, b= c= -1 +2√6.

Compute a² + b² + c².

First, compute a²:

a = (25 +4√6)/23

a² = (25 +4√6)^2 / (23)^2

Compute numerator:

25² + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2 = 625 + 200√6 + 16*6 =625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6

So, a²= (721 +200√6)/529

Now, compute b²:

b = -1 +2√6

b²= (-1)^2 + 2*(-1)(2√6) + (2√6)^2 =1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6

So, b²=25 -4√6

Since c =b, c²=25 -4√6

So, a² + b² + c²= (721 +200√6)/529 + (25 -4√6) + (25 -4√6)

Simplify:

= (721 +200√6)/529 + 50 -8√6

Convert 50 and -8√6 to over denominator 529:

50=50*529/529=26450/529

-8√6= (-8√6)*529/529= (-4232√6)/529

So:

= (721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6)/529

Combine like terms:

Numerator:

721 +26450=27171

200√6 -4232√6= (200 -4232)√6= (-4032)√6

So, numerator is 27171 -4032√6

Thus, a² + b² + c²= (27171 -4032√6)/529

But wait, is this correct? Because 50 is 25 +25, but earlier, when I computed a² + b² +c², it's a² + 2b².

Wait, no: a² + b² + c² where a, b, c are different variables. In this case, since c = b, so it's a² + 2b².

Wait, but in our earlier step, we had a² + b² + c² = a² + 2b². Since from case 2, c = b.

Wait, but in the case 2, a² + b² + c² = a² + 2b².

Which is exactly what we've computed.

So, a² + 2b² = (721 +200√6)/529 + 2*(25 -4√6 )

Wait, let me recompute that.

Wait, no. Wait, a² + b² + c²= a² + 2b².

Which is a² + 2b².

But a² is (721 +200√6)/529, and 2b² is 2*(25 -4√6 )=50 -8√6.

So, when adding:

(721 +200√6)/529 +50 -8√6.

Convert 50 and -8√6 to have denominator
