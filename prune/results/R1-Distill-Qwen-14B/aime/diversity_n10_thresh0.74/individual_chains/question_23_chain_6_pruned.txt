Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally because the positive term is with x². The transverse axis length is related to the denominator under x², which is 20, so the transverse radius squared, a², is 20. Similarly, the conjugate axis is related to the denominator under y², which is 24, so b² is 24.

Now, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola such that ABCD is a rhombus, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are the lines connecting opposite vertices of the rhombus, and they cross at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, which is consistent with their intersection at the origin.

The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and we need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD² across all possible rhombi that can be formed on this hyperbola with the given conditions.

Let me break this down. First, since the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, each diagonal must pass through the origin. So, the diagonals are essentially lines passing through the origin, and the rhombus is formed by their intersections with the hyperbola.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if one diagonal is BD, the other diagonal must be AC, and they should be perpendicular. Since they intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices can be considered as points where the diagonals meet the hyperbola.

Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

Let me think in terms of coordinates. Suppose that diagonal BD lies along some line through the origin, and AC lies along another line through the origin, perpendicular to BD.

Let me denote the coordinates of the points. Let's say point B is (x, y), then point D should be the reflection across the origin, so (-x, -y). Similarly, points A and C are reflections across the origin, so if A is (p, q), then C is (-p, -q).

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, for point B: (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1.

Similarly, for point A: (p²)/20 - (q²)/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal in length. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to model the diagonals. The diagonals of the rhombus BD and AC are perpendicular, intersecting at the origin. So, BD has length sqrt((x - (-x))² + (y - (-y))²) = sqrt((2x)² + (2y)²) = 2*sqrt(x² + y²).

Similarly, AC has length sqrt((p - (-p))² + (q - (-q))²) = 2*sqrt(p² + q²).

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily of equal length, except that they bisect each other at right angles.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this in terms of vectors. Let me consider the vectors for the diagonals. If BD is a diagonal, then the vector from B to D is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, the vector from A to C is (-2p, -2q). Since the diagonals are perpendicular,
