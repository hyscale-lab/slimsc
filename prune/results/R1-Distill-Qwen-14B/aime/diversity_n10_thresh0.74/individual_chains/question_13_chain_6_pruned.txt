Okay, so I have this problem about Aya going for a walk every morning. Let me try to understand what's going on here. 

First, it says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. So, the walk is 9 kilometers each time.

There are two scenarios given:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours. But wait, it says including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. Hmm, so the total time is 4 hours, which includes both the walking time and the time she spends in the coffee shop.

2. When she walks at a speed of 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, this includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

The question is asking: If Aya walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how many minutes will her walk take her, including the 't' minutes in the coffee shop?

Alright, let's break this down. I think I need to find the relationship between her walking speed and the total time, including the coffee shop time. Maybe I can set up some equations based on the given information.

First, let's consider the first scenario. She walks 9 km at speed 's' km/h. The time she spends walking is the distance divided by speed, so 9/s hours. But the total time is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, but t is in minutes, so I might want to convert everything to the same unit.

Wait, maybe I should convert the total time into hours or minutes. Let me think. Maybe converting everything to hours would make sense because the speed is in km per hour.

So, in the first case: walking time is 9/s hours. The total time is 4 hours, which includes walking and coffee shop time. So, the coffee shop time is (total time) - (walking time). But the coffee shop time is given as 't' minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, let me convert everything to minutes to make it consistent.

So, the total time in the first case is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. The walking time is (9/s) hours, which is (9/s) * 60 minutes. So, the coffee shop time 't' is total time minus walking time, which is 240 - (9/s)*60.

Similarly, in the second case, she walks at speed 's + 2' km/h. The walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours, which is (9/(s + 2)) * 60 minutes. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Converting that to minutes: 2 * 60 = 120, plus 24 is 144 minutes. So, the coffee shop time is 144 - (9/(s + 2)) * 60.

But wait, the coffee shop time 't' is the same in both cases. So, I can set these two expressions equal to each other.

So, from the first scenario:

t = 240 - (9/s)*60

From the second scenario:

t = 144 - (9/(s + 2))*60

Since both equal t, I can set them equal to each other:

240 - (9/s)*60 = 144 - (9/(s + 2))*60

Now, I can solve for 's'. Let's write that equation again:

240 - (540/s) = 144 - (540/(s + 2))

Wait, because 9*60 is 540, so yeah, right.

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for 's'. Let's move all terms to one side.

240 - 144 = (540/s) - (540/(s + 2))

So, 96 = 540*(1/s - 1/(s + 2))

Hmm, that's 96 equals 540 times the difference of reciprocals.

Let me compute 540*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)).

First, compute 1/s - 1/(s+2) = (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) = 2/(s(s + 2))

So, 96 = 540*(2/(s(s + 2)))

Simplify that: 96 = (1080)/(s(s + 2))

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

96 * s(s + 2) = 1080

Divide both sides by 96:

s(s + 2) = 1080 / 96

Calculate 1080 divided by 96. Let me do this division.

Well, 96 * 11 = 1056. 1080 - 1056 = 24. So, 11 and 24/96, which is 11.25.

Wait, 1080 ÷ 96:

Let me compute 96 × 11 = 1056, as above.

1080 - 1056 = 24. So, 24 is 96 × 0.25, since 96 × 0.25 is 24.

So, 1080 / 96 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Which is the same as s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, I can solve this quadratic equation for 's'.

Using the quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

So, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 4 - 4*(1)*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

sqrt(D) = 7

So, s = [-2 ±7]/2

We have two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5

s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h

So, Aya's walking speed is 2.5 km/h.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time, including coffee shop time, for this speed.

First, compute the walking time at 3 km/h.

Walking time = distance / speed = 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Which is 3 hours, but wait, 3 hours is 180 minutes. But wait, wait, no, the total time includes the coffee shop time 't'.

Wait, no, the walking time is 3 hours, and then she spends 't' minutes in the coffee shop. So the total time is 3 hours plus t minutes.

Wait, but let's get 't' from one of the previous scenarios. Let's compute 't' using the first scenario.

In the first scenario, when she walked at 2.5 km/h, the total time was 4 hours, which included walking time and 't' minutes.

Walking time at 2.5 km/h: 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours. To convert to minutes, 3.6 *
