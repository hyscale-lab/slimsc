Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. All sides are equal, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, which I assume goes in order. The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me think about the properties of such a hexagon. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, it's similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal. Wait, no, in a regular hexagon all sides and angles are equal, but here it's only equilateral with opposite sides parallel. So it's a special kind of equilateral hexagon.

I remember that in such hexagons, the opposite sides are not only parallel but also equal in length, but wait, no, in this case, all sides are equal, so that's already given. So each pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel, which is a defining feature.

Now, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. So, that triangle is probably the outer triangle that encloses the hexagon, with each side being the extension of one of these three sides.

I think I can model this with vectors or coordinate geometry. Maybe placing the hexagon in a coordinate system would help. Let me visualize it. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as having three pairs of parallel sides. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, no, the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is opposite to DE? Or is it that each side is opposite to another? Let me recall the labeling: ABCDEF. So, AB is between A and B, BC between B and C, CD between C and D, DE between D and E, EF between E and F, and FA between F and A.

So, the opposite sides would be AB opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. Because in a hexagon, each side has an opposite side three apart in the sequence.

So, AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD ||
