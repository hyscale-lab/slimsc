Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the hexagon. Since it's equilateral, all its sides are equal in length, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not be equal. Also, the fact that opposite sides are parallel suggests that the hexagon might be similar to a regular hexagon but scaled or transformed in some way.

I remember that in such a hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is both equal in length and parallel. So, AB is parallel and equal to DE, BC is parallel and equal to EF, and CD is parallel and equal to FA. Wait, no, actually, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel but not equal in length unless it's regular. Wait, no, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal, so opposite sides are both equal and parallel. So in this case, the hexagon is equilateral but not necessarily regular, but still has opposite sides parallel. So, it's a special kind of hexagon.

I also recall that for a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a truncated parallelogram or something similar. Maybe it's a centrally symmetric hexagon. Wait, central symmetry would mean that each vertex has another vertex directly opposite to it, and the sides would be equal and parallel.
