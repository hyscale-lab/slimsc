Okay, so I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Let me break this down.

First, an 8x8 grid means we're moving from the lower left corner (0,0) to the upper right corner (8,8). Each step on the grid can be either right or up. Since we need to get from (0,0) to (8,8), we have to take exactly 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U).

Now, the problem says the paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, so what does that mean? Changing direction would mean switching from moving right to up or from up to right. Each time you switch, that's a direction change. So, if a path has four direction changes, how does that break down?

Let me think. Each time you change direction, it's like starting a new segment in one direction. So, for example, if you start by moving right, then change to up, that's one direction change. Each segment is a consecutive sequence of the same direction.

So, if there are four direction changes, how many segments do we have? Each direction change adds a new segment. Starting from the first segment, each change adds another segment. So, 4 direction changes would create 5 segments. For example, RRRUUURRRR would have two direction changes: R to U and U to R. So, 2 changes give 3 segments.

Wait, but in my problem, there are four direction changes, which would mean five segments. So, the path would have five alternating segments of right and up moves.

But wait, since we start at (0,0), the first segment can be either right or up. So, the path can start with a right or an up, and then alternate. But since we're going to (8,8), the number of right and up moves must each be 8. So, the number of segments in each direction depends on how many times we switch.

Wait, let me visualize this. Suppose the path starts with right. So, segments would be R, U, R, U, R. That would be five segments with four direction changes. Similarly, if it starts with up, it's U, R, U, R, U, also
