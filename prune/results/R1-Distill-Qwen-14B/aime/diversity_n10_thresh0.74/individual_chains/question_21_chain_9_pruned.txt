Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. The task is to find the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Hmm, okay. So, to rephrase, in base b, a two-digit number would be something like 'd1 d0', where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. So, the value of this number in base 10 is d1*b + d0. 

The condition for being b-eautiful is that d1 + d0 equals the square root of n, where n is the number in base 10 (since n is d1*b + d0). So, sqrt(n) = d1 + d0.

But wait, n is d1*b + d0, so substituting, we get sqrt(d1*b + d0) = d1 + d0. Let me write that equation down:

sqrt(d1*b + d0) = d1 + d0

If I square both sides to eliminate the square root, I get:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2

So, expanding the right side:

d1*b + d0 = d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2

Now, let's rearrange this equation to bring everything to one side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, perhaps rearranged as:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

Wait, that might be a quadratic equation in terms of d1. Let me see:

This is a quadratic in d1, so if I treat d0 as a constant, I can write it as:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

Let me think about solving this quadratic equation for d1. The quadratic formula gives:

d1 = [ -(2*d0 - b) ± sqrt( (2*d0 - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(d0^2 - d0) ) ] / 2

Simplify the discriminant:

(2*d0 - b)^2 - 4*(d0^2 - d0) 

Expanding (2d0 - b)^2:

= 4d0^2 - 4b d0 + b^2

So the discriminant becomes:

4d0^2 - 4b d0 + b^2 - 4d0^2 + 4d0

Simplify:

(4d0^2 - 4d0^2) + (-4b d0 + 4d0) + b^2

Which simplifies to:

0 + (-4b d0 + 4d0) + b^2

Factor out 4d0 from the first two terms:

= (4d0(-b + 1)) + b^2

So, discriminant D = 4d0(1 - b) + b^2

Hmm, okay. So the discriminant must be a perfect square for d1 to be an integer, since d1 is a digit in base b, which must be an integer between 0 and b-1. Also, d0 is a digit, so d0 must be between 0 and b-1.

Wait, but in a two-digit number, the leading digit d1 can't be zero, so d1 must be at least 1. So d1 is in 1 to b-1, and d0 is in 0 to b-1.

So, for each base b, we can iterate over possible d1 and d0, but maybe instead, since the equation is quadratic, we can find a way to parameterize it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the original equation:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2

Let me rearrange this as:

(d1 + d0)^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

But maybe another approach would be better. Let me think.

We have two digits d1 and d0, each between 0 and b-1 (with d1 ≥ 1). The sum s = d1 + d0 is equal to sqrt(n), which is sqrt(d1*b + d0). So, s must be an integer because d1 and d0 are integers, so s is an integer, and s^2 = d1*b + d0.

So, s is a positive integer, and s^2 = d1*b + d0.

But since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, we know:

d1 is in 1 to b-1,

d0 is in 0 to b-1,

so s^2 = d1*b + d0.

Also, since d1 + d0 = s,

So, substituting d0 = s - d1 into the equation:

s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)

=> s^2 = d1*(b - 1) + s

Rearranging:

d1*(b - 1) = s^2 - s

Thus,

d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Since d1 is an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, the numerator must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be within that range.

So, let's write:

d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Which implies that (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).

Also, since d1 is at least 1 and at most b-1,

1 ≤ (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1

Which can be written as:

(b - 1) ≤ s^2 - s ≤ (b - 1)(b - 1)

Because multiplying all parts by (b-1), since b-1 is positive (b ≥ 2).

So,

(b - 1) ≤ s^2 - s ≤ (b - 1)^2

Hmm, this gives us a range for s in terms of b. Let me think about possible s values.

Since s = d1 + d0, and d1 is at least 1, d0 at least 0, s is at least 1. On the upper side, the maximum s is when d1 is maximum (b-1) and d0 is maximum (b-1), so s_max = 2*(b-1).

So, s can range from 1 to 2*(b-1).

But given the previous inequality,

(b - 1) ≤ s^2 - s ≤ (b - 1)^2

Let me solve for s in these inequalities.

First, lower bound:

s^2 - s ≥ b - 1

And upper bound:

s^2 - s ≤ (b - 1)^2

Let me consider the lower bound equation:

s^2 - s - (b - 1) ≥ 0

Which is a quadratic in s: s^2 - s - (b - 1) ≥ 0

The roots of the quadratic equation s^2 - s - (b - 1) = 0 can be found using the quadratic formula.

s = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*(b - 1))]/2

= [1 ± sqrt(4b - 3)]/2

So, the positive root is [1 + sqrt(4b -3)]/2.

Since s must be an integer ≥1, the inequality s^2 - s ≥ b -1 will hold for s ≥ [1 + sqrt(4b -3)]/2.

Similarly, the upper bound:

s^2 - s ≤ (b -1)^2

Again, a quadratic in s: s^2 - s - (b -1)^2 ≤ 0

The roots are [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*(b -1)^2)]/2.

The positive root is [1 + sqrt(4*(b -1)^2 + 1)]/2.

So, the inequality holds for s between the two roots.

But since s must be an integer, we'll have s values between 1 and 2*(b-1), but given the upper bound, perhaps s can't be too large.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach is better.

Let me think again about the equation s^2 = d1*b + d0.

But d0 = s - d1, so substituting:

s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)

=> s^2 = d1*(b -1) + s

=> d1*(b -1) = s^2 - s

So, d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)

Since d1 must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1).

So, for each possible s, (s^2 - s) must be a multiple of (b -1). So, perhaps for each b, we can find the s values that satisfy this condition and then check if d1 is an integer within the valid range.

But our goal is to find the minimal b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So, for each b, we can compute the number of s values that satisfy the conditions, and find the minimal b where this count exceeds ten.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize this in terms of s and some other variable.

Wait, another idea: Let me denote (b -1) as k. So, k = b -1, which implies b = k +1. Since b ≥2, k ≥1.

Then, d1 = (s^2 - s)/k

Which must be an integer, so (s^
