Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The problem says: We have a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. 

First, let's recall what each term means. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's a unique mode, 9 appears more times than any other number. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer not in the list, which is interesting.

So, let's jot down the key points:

1. Sum of all items = 30
2. Mode is 9 (appears more than any other number)
3. Median is an integer not in the list.

We're to find the sum of the squares of all items.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since the mode is 9, it must appear at least twice. But to be the unique mode, it has to appear more than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times. If another number appears three times, 9 must appear four times, and so on.

Next, the median. Since it's not in the list, it must be the average of two middle numbers in the case of an even-length list. Because the median is an integer, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer, meaning both middle numbers are either both odd or both even. But since the median isn't in the list, that suggests that the two middle numbers are different numbers whose average is an integer not present in the list.

Hmm, okay. So let's think about the structure of the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements in the list. Since the median is a specific integer, n must be such that the middle position(s) can produce such a median.

Let me consider possible lengths of the list. Since the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, the list can't be too long. Let's see: if all numbers were 1, the list would have 30 elements. But that's probably not the case here. Let's think about possible n.

Wait, but the mode is 9, so there are multiple 9s. Let's consider possible n.

Wait, perhaps n is odd or even. Let's explore both.

Case 1: n is odd. Then the median is the middle number. But the median is not in the list, which would mean that the middle number is not present. But if n is odd, the middle number is the (n+1)/2-th term. But if that's the median, and it's not in the list, that term must be different from 9, but 9 is the mode, so maybe the list doesn't have that median value. Hmm, but 9 is a number in the list, so if the median is not in the list, but 9 is the mode, maybe 9 is not the median. So the median is some other number that isn't in the list.

Alternatively, if n is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Since the median is an integer not in the list, those two middle numbers must add up to an even number, which is the median. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are both 8, the median would be 8, but if 8 is in the list, then that's a problem. Wait, but the median is not in the list, so if the two middle numbers are, say, 7 and 9, their average is 8, which is not in the list. But wait, 9 is in the list, so that's possible.

Wait, but let's think. Let's say the list has an even number of elements, 2k. So the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th terms. So, if the median is an integer, then the sum of the k-th and (k+1)-th terms must be even, so their average is an integer.

Moreover, the median is not present in the list. So, the median is not equal to either the k-th or (k+1)-th term, because if it was, that term would be in the list. Wait, but the median is the average of the two, so if both are the same, then the median is that same number, which would be in the list. Therefore, to have the median not be in the list, the two middle terms must be different, and their average is an integer not present in the list.

For example, if the two middle terms are 8 and 10, their average is 9. So the median is 9, which is in the list. But in our case, the median is not in the list. So that's not acceptable. Therefore, if the two middle terms are 7 and 9, their average is 8. If 8 is not in the list, that's acceptable. So the median would be 8, which is not in the list.

Wait, but 9 is in the list, so if the two middle terms are 7 and 9, then 9 is in the list, but the median is 8, which isn't. So that could be a possibility.

Alternatively, if the two middle terms are 8 and 10, the median would be 9, which is in the list, which isn't allowed. So this case is invalid.

So, perhaps the two middle terms are 7 and 9, but then 8 is the median, which isn't in the list. That would satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, the two middle terms could be 6 and 10, giving a median of 8, which isn't in the list. Or 5 and 11, giving median 8, but then 5 and 11 are in the list, and 8 isn't.

But wait, if the two middle terms are 7 and 9, then the median is 8, and 8 isn't in the list. But in this case, 9 is in the list, so that's acceptable.

Wait, but let's think about the list in order. Let me consider that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let's denote that the list is: a1, a2, ..., an, where a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

If n is even, say n=2k, then the median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2.

So, to have the median not in the list, (a_k + a_{k+1}) must be even, and the result must not be present in the list.

Now, since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number.

So, perhaps 9 appears multiple times, but let's see.

Let me consider possible lengths n.

Let's try n=5, which is odd. Then the median is the 3rd term. But since the median is
