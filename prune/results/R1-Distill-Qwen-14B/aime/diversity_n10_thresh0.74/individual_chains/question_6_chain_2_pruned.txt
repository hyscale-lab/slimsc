Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and it's about finding the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions involved are a bit complicated, so I need to take it step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. The functions are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, the two graphs we're looking at are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many times these two graphs intersect.

Hmm, intersections between y = something and x = something else. Normally, intersections are points where x and y satisfy both equations. So to find the points (a, b) where a = 4g(f(cos(3πb))) and b = 4g(f(sin(2πa))). So each intersection point must satisfy both equations.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can approach it by analyzing the functions f and g first, then see how they're used in the bigger functions.

Let's start with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So f is a composition of absolute values. Let's see what this looks like. The inner function |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 shifts this down by 1/2. The graph would have its vertex at (0, -1/2). But then we take the absolute value of that. So f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

So when |x| - 1/2 is negative, the absolute value will flip it. Let's find where |x| - 1/2 is zero: |x| = 1/2, so x = ±1/2. So for |x| < 1/2, |x| -1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

For |x| ≥ 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

So the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that starts at x = -1/2 with f(-1/2) = 0, goes up to f(0) = 1/2, then back down to f(1/2) = 0, and then continues upwards as |x| increases beyond 1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this as well.

Again, start with |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So the critical points are where |x| = 1/4, which is x = ±1/4.

For |x| < 1/4: |x| - 1/4 is negative, so g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

For |x| ≥ 1/4: |x| - 1/4 is non-negative, so g(x) = |x| - 1/4.

So g(x) is a V-shape that starts at x = -1/4, f(-1/4) = 0, goes up to f(0) = 1/4, then back down to x=1/4, f(1/4)=0, and then continues upwards as |x| increases beyond 1/4.

Now, let me consider the functions inside y and x.

For the first equation: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break this down.

First, compute sin(2πx). The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 1. So sin(2πx) has a period of 1 as well, since the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k. So 2πx has a period of 1.

Next, f(sin(2πx)) is the function f applied to sin(2πx). Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, f of that would be ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Let me think about the range of f(sin(2πx)). Since |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1, when |sin(2πx)| is less than 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|. When |sin(2πx)| is greater than or equal to 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2.

So f(sin(2πx)) will have a range from 0 to 1/2. Because when |sin| is 1, f gives 1 -1/2=1/2. When |sin| is 0, f gives 1/2.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let me compute f(sin(2πx)) more carefully.

Let me denote z = sin(2πx), which is in [-1,1]. Then f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|.

So when |z| is in [0, 1/2], f(z) = 1/2 - |z|.

When |z| is in [1/2,1], f(z) = |z| - 1/2.

So the minimum value of f(z) is 0 (when |z|=1/2), and the maximum is 1/2 (when |z|=1).

So f(z) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g(f(z)) is g applied to f(z). Since f(z) is in [0,1/2], let's see what g does here.

g(w) = ||w| - 1/4|. But since w is already non-negative (because it's f(z)), we can drop the absolute value around w.

So for w in [0,1/2], let's see where w is with respect to 1/4.

If w < 1/4, then g(w) = 1/4 - w.

If w ≥ 1/4, then g(w) = w - 1/4.

So when w is in [0, 1/4], g(w) = 1/4 - w.

When w is in [1/4, 1/2], g(w) = w - 1/4.

So the range of g(f(z)) is as follows:

- When f(z) is in [0, 1/4], g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z). Since f(z) can go up to 1/2, but in this case, f(z) is in [0,1/4], so g(f(z)) goes from 1/4 down to 0.

- When f(z) is in [1/4, 1/2], g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4, which goes from 0 up to 1/4.

Wait, let me check:

Wait, when f(z) is in [0, 1/4], g(w) = 1/4 - w. So when w=0, it's 1/4; when w=1/4, it's 0.

When f(z) is in [1/4, 1/2], g(w) = w - 1/4. So when w=1/4, it's 0; when w=1/2, it's 1/4.

So the overall range of g(f(z)) is [0, 1/4].

Therefore, 4g(f(z)) is 4 times that, so it ranges from 0 to 1. So 4g(f(z)) is in [0,1].

So y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1. Similarly, x =4g(f(cos(3πy))) is another function, but in terms of y.

But wait, the second equation is x =4g(f(cos(3πy))). So for each y, x is determined by this function.

So to find the intersections, I need to find points (a, b) where:

1. b = 4g(f(sin(2πa)))

2. a = 4g(f(cos(3πb)))

So both a and b are between 0 and 1 because 4g(f(...)) ranges between 0 and 1.

Wait, but since x and y can be any real numbers, but in this case, since sin and cos are periodic, maybe the functions are periodic and we can find
