Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me visualize this. So, there's rectangle ABCD. Let me remember that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is 107, which would make CD also 107. BC is 16, so AD is 16 as well.

Then there's another rectangle EFGH. So, EF is 184, which means GH is also 184. FG is 17, so EH is 17.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. That means these four points lie on a straight line. So, the points are in order D-E-C-F or maybe some other permutation? Hmm, but since they are collinear and part of two rectangles, I need to figure out their arrangement.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the circumference of the same circle. That might be important for applying some circle theorems or properties.

Let me try to sketch a rough diagram in my mind. So, rectangle ABCD: let's say points A, B, C, D in order, forming a rectangle. So, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if I imagine this rectangle, A is at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, D at the top left. Then, points D, E, C, F are on a straight line. So, D is the top left of ABCD, and then going along a line, we have E, then C, then F.

So, E is between D and C, and F is after C? Or could E be on the other side? Hmm, probably E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. Because if E were on the other side, it might complicate the rectangles.

But wait, EFGH is a rectangle. So, if F is on the line D-E-C-F, then F is the next point after C. So, EFGH is another rectangle attached to the line D-E-C-F.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, point H is one of the vertices of rectangle EFGH. Let me think about the positions.

In rectangle EFGH, points E, F, G, H are connected in order. So, if E is on the line D-E-C-F, and F is after C, then H must be on one side of EF, and G on the other.

But since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, H and G must be positioned such that when connected to A and D, they form a cyclic quadrilateral.

This seems a bit abstract. Maybe I should assign coordinates to these points to make things clearer.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, which is the height. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, AB is the base, BC is the height.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if I place point A at (0,0), then point B would be at (107, 0), point C at (107, 16), and point D at (0, 16). Wait, is that correct? No, wait: If ABCD is a rectangle, then the order is A, B, C, D, right? So, AB is the base, BC is the right side, CD is the top
