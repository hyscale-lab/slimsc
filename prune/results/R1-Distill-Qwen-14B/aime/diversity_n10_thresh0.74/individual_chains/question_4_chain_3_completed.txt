Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this token game. Let me try to figure out the winning strategy here. So the rules are: they have a stack of n tokens, take turns starting with Alice. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob the winner, regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, so this sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position is one where there's at least one move that forces the opponent into a losing position.

So, let's model this. Maybe I should look for a pattern by calculating the winning (W) and losing (L) positions for small n.

Let's start with n=0. Wait, that's the base case. If there are 0 tokens, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So, n=0 is a losing position because you can't move, but I think in this case, n=0 is the end. So maybe it's better to think in terms of positions n≥1.

Wait, let me think again. When n=0, the game is over, so the player who just took the last token wins. So, for n=1, the first player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position (W).

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who can then take it and win. Wait, no, if Alice takes 1, Bob is left with 1 and can take it to win. So Alice wouldn't do that. Alternatively, Alice could take 1, but wait, Alice can't take 4 because n=2 <4. So she can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes it and wins. So Alice can't make a move that leads to her winning. So for n=2, Alice can't force a win, so n=2 is a losing position? Wait, that can't be right because in n=2, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last one and wins. So for n=2, Alice can't win, so n=2 is an L.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to list the positions step by step.

n=0: game ends, last player to move wins. So if it's your turn and n=0, you lose because you can't move. So n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: You can take 1 and win, so W.

n=2: Take 1, leaving 1 for opponent. Opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is L because any move leaves opponent in W. Wait, but wait: when n=2, you can only take 1, leaving n=1, which is W for the opponent. So n=2 is L. So yes, n=2 is L.

n=3: Take 1, leaving 2, which is L. So opponent is in L, so you can force a win. So n=3 is W.

n=4: You can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So W.

n=5: You can take 1, leaving 4, which is W for opponent, or take 4, leaving 1, which is W for opponent. Wait, that's bad. So no matter what you do, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.

Wait, is that correct? Let's see:

n=5: Alice's options are take 1, leaving 4 (which is W for Bob), or take 4, leaving 1 (W for Bob). So Bob can always take the remaining tokens and win. So yes, n=5 is L.

n=6: Take 1, leaving 5 (L for Bob). So n=6 is W because you can leave Bob at L.

n=7: Take 1, leaving 6 (W for Bob). Or take 4, leaving 3 (W for Bob). So both options leave Bob in W, so n=7 is L.

Wait, so n=7 is L.

n=8: Take 1, leaving 7 (L for Bob), so n=8 is W.

n=9: Take 1, leaving 8 (W), or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if Alice takes 4, leaving 5 (L), then Bob is in a losing position. So n=9 is W.

Wait, but wait: n=5 is L, so if Alice can take 4 from 9, leaving 5, which is L, then Bob can't win. So n=9 is W.

n=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). So both moves leave Bob in a W position. So n=10 is L.

Hmm, let me list these:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Result: L W L W W L W L W W L

Wait, so the pattern seems to be repeating every 5? Let me check the sequence:

n 0: L

n 1: W

n 2: L

n 3: W

n4: W

n5: L

n6: W

n7: L

n8: W

n9: W

n10: L

Wait, that's from n=0 to n=10. So the pattern from n=0 is L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L...

So the cycle is 5 positions long? Let's see: from n=0 to n=4, the pattern is L, W, L, W, W. Then from n=5 to n=9, it's L, W, L, W, W. So yes, a cycle of 5.

So if the cycle is every 5, then for any n, the result is determined by n mod 5.

Wait, let me test n=11:

n=11: take 1, leaving 10 (L). So n=11 is W.

n=12: take 1, leaving 11 (W), or take 4, leaving 8 (W). So both options leave Bob in W. So n=12 is L.

Hmm, so the pattern for n=10 is L, n=11 is W, n=12 is L, n=13 would be W, n=14 is W, and n=15 is L.

So the pattern from n=5 is L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W...

So, the cycle is of length 5, and the losing positions (L) occur at n ≡0 mod5, n=5k.

Wait, n=5: 5 → L.

n=10: 10 → L.

n=15: 15 → L.

Yes, so if n is a multiple of 5, then it's a losing position.

Wait, but earlier for n=5, it's L, and n=10 is L, so that suggests that if n mod5=0, it's L.

But wait, when n=5, you can take 1, leaving 4 (W), or take 4, leaving 1 (W). So no matter what, Bob can win.

Similarly, n=10: if Alice takes 1, Bob can take 4, leaving 5 (L). Wait, no, Bob would have different options.

Wait, no. Wait, n=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9 (W). Bob can then take 1, leaving 8 (W), or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if Bob takes 4, leaving 5 (L), then Alice is in a losing position. So n=10 is W? But earlier I thought n=10 is L. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, this suggests that my initial assessment might be wrong. Let me re-examine n=5 and n=10.

At n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 (W). Bob can then take 4 and win. Or Alice can take 4, leaving 1 (W), Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't avoid Bob winning, so n=5 is L.

At n=10: Alice's options are take 1 (leaving 9, which is W) or take 4 (leaving 6, which is W).

So if Alice takes 1, leaving 9 (W). Then Bob can take 4, leaving 5 (L), so Alice is forced into a losing position. So Bob can win.

Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 6 (W). Then Bob can take 1, leaving 5 (L), again forcing Alice into a losing position.

So for n=10, regardless of Alice's move, Bob can force Alice into a losing position. So n=10 is L.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about n=10, I thought it was L. So the initial idea that multiples of 5 are losing positions holds.

Similarly, n=15: Alice can take 1, leaving 14 (W), or take 4, leaving 11 (W). Bob can then take the appropriate amount to leave Alice at 10 (L).

Hmm, so the pattern seems to be that every n ≡0 mod5 is a losing position.

So, the losing positions are n=5k for k≥1.

Wait, wait, but let's check n=6: 6 mod5=1. So it's W, which is correct because Alice can take 1, leaving 5 (L).

n=7: 7 mod5=2 → L.

n=8: 8 mod5=3 → W.

n=9: 9 mod5=4 → W.

n=10: 10 mod5=0 → L.

Yes, so the losing positions are n ≡0 mod5.

So, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Bob can win regardless of Alice's moves.

So, the number of n ≤2024 where n is a multiple of 5.

So, how many multiples of 5 are there from 1 to 2024?

The first multiple is 5, then 10, 15,... up to the largest multiple ≤2024.

The largest multiple is 2020 because 2024 ÷5 is 404.8, so 5×404=2020.

So, the number of multiples is 404.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if n=0 is considered. But the problem says positive integers n ≤2024. So n starts at 1.

The first multiple is 5×1=5, up to 5×404=2020. So the count is 404.

So the answer is 404.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure that the initial analysis is correct.

Wait, let's see for n=5, n=10, etc., whether they are indeed losing positions.

At n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4. Bob can take 4 and win. If Alice takes 4, leaving 1. Bob takes 1 and wins. So yes, n=5 is L.

At n=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9. Bob can take 1, leaving 8. Or take 4, leaving 5. Wait, but n=5 is L, so if Bob leaves Alice with n=5, Alice is in a losing position. So yes, Bob can win.

Wait, another way: for any n=5k, the player to move can't force a win because any move (taking 1 or 4) will leave the opponent in a position that's not a multiple of 5, allowing the opponent to adjust and bring it back to a multiple of 5.

Wait, but let me think: if Bob is the second player, he can win if n is a multiple of 5 because whatever Alice does, Bob can bring the count back to the next lower multiple of 5.

For example, if n=5k:

- If Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4 (1+4=5), bringing the total taken in that round to 5, so the new n is 5(k-1).

- If Alice takes 4, Bob takes 1, again bringing the total taken to 5, so new n=5(k-1).

In this way, Bob can always bring n down to the next lower multiple of 5, eventually forcing Alice to face n=5, where Bob can take the remaining tokens and win.

Wait, but wait. When n=5, the player to move (Alice) is forced to leave Bob in a position where he can take the rest. So yes, n=5 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is.

So, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a multiple of 5 because then Alice is forced to move first, and Bob can always respond to bring it back to a multiple of 5.

So, the number of such n is the number of multiples of 5 between 1 and 2024.

The smallest multiple is 5×1=5, the largest is 5×404=2020.

So the total number is 404.

Wait, but 2024 ÷5 is 404.8, so 5×404=2020. So yes, 404 multiples.

Hence, the answer is 404.


Alice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, taking turns to remove either $1$ or $4$ tokens. Alice goes first, and the player who removes the last token wins. To determine the number of positive integers $n \leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions.

A position $n$ is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position allows the player to force the opponent into a losing position. By examining small values of $n$, we observe a pattern in the game's outcomes:

- $n=0$: Losing position (game ends).
- $n=1$: Winning position (take 1 token).
- $n=2$: Losing position (any move leaves the opponent in a winning position).
- $n=3$: Winning position (take 1 token, leaving $n=2$ for the opponent).
- $n=4$: Winning position (take 4 tokens and win).
- $n=5$: Losing position (any move leaves the opponent in a winning position).
- $n=6$: Winning position (take 1 token, leaving $n=5$ for the opponent).
- $n=7$: Losing position (any move leaves the opponent in a winning position).
- $n=8$: Winning position (take 1 token, leaving $n=7$ for the opponent).
- $n=9$: Winning position (take 4 tokens, leaving $n=5$ for the opponent).
- $n=10$: Losing position (any move leaves the opponent in a winning position).

From this, we identify that the losing positions occur at $n = 5k$ for $k \geq 1$. Thus, if $n$ is a multiple of $5$, Bob can always respond to Alice's moves in a way that forces her into another losing position, ultimately leading to Bob's victory.

To find the number of such $n \leq 2024$, we calculate the number of multiples of $5$ in this range. The smallest multiple is $5$, and the largest is $2020$ (since $2024 \div 5 = 404.8$). Therefore, there are $404$ multiples of $5$ between $1$ and $2024$.

The number of positive integers $n \leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win is $\boxed{404}$.
