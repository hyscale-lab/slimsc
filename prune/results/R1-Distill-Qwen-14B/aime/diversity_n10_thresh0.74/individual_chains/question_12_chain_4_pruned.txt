Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999. The second condition is that when I read the numbers top to bottom, their sum is 99. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are 6 cells. Let me label them as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the top row is a, b, c and the bottom row is d, e, f. Each of these cells will contain a digit from 0 to 9.

When reading left to right, the top row forms a three-digit number, which is 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom row forms another three-digit number, 100d + 10e + f. The sum of these two numbers should be 999. So, mathematically, that's:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is a followed by d, making the number 10a + d. The second column is b followed by e, making 10b + e. The third column is c followed by f, making 10c + f. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99. So:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

So, now I have two equations:

1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2) 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I need to find the number of possible digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) that satisfy both equations.

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to simplify things. Let's try that.

Equation 1 minus equation 2:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99

Simplify the left side:

100a - 10a + 10b - 10b + c - 10c + 100d - d + 10e - e + f - f

Which is:

90a -9c + 99d +9e

And the right side is 900.

So, 90a -9c +99d +9e = 900

I can factor out a 9 from each term on the left:

9(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100

Hmm, that's a simpler equation. Let me write that down:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100 ---> Equation 3

Now, I also have equation 2:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 ---> Equation 2

I think it's better to express equation 2 in terms that might relate to equation 3.

Let me rewrite equation 2:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Wait a second, the first terms of each column: 10a + d, 10b + e, 10c + f.

But equation 3 is 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Hmm, perhaps I can express e from equation 3 in terms of the other variables.

From equation 3:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100

So, e = 100 -10a + c -11d

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can find another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for some variables.

Wait, let's think about equation 2:

Let me denote the three column sums as:

C1 = 10a + d

C2 = 10b + e

C3 = 10c + f

So, C1 + C2 + C3 = 99.

Each of these C1, C2, C3 is a two-digit number, so each is between 0 and 99. But since a is the first digit of a two-digit number, a can be 0 to 9, but if a is 0, then 10a + d is just d, which is a single digit. Wait, but in the problem statement, the grid is filled with digits, so each cell is a single digit, but when read top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, a is the tens digit and d is the units digit, regardless of whether a is zero. So, 10a + d can be from
