Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter point I to each of the faces. The distance should be expressed in the form m√n / p, and I have to find m + n + p. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces. This distance is called the inradius. To find the inradius, I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the area (or more precisely, the total surface area) of all its faces.

Wait, actually, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius r is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So I need to compute both V and S.

But before that, I should probably check if the given tetrahedron is isohedral or something like that. Because the edge lengths are given in pairs: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. So each pair of opposite edges are equal. That suggests that it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron, maybe a disphenoid. I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which is the case here. So that might help because in a disphenoid, the inradius can be found more easily.

But maybe I should just proceed step by step. Let's first try to compute the volume. To compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edges, I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. The formula is:

V = sqrt( CM / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is a determinant of a 5x5 matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC²  0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD²  0  |

So plugging in the given edge lengths:

AB = √41, so AB² = 41
AC = √80, so AC² = 80
AD = √89, so AD² = 89
BC = √89, so BC² = 89
BD = √80, so BD² = 80
CD = √41, so CD² = 41

So the matrix looks like:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me make sure. The second row corresponds to AB², AC², AD². So yes, AB² is 41, AC² is 80, AD² is 89. The third row is BC², BD², CD²? Wait, no, the third row is AB², BC², BD². Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, the Cayley-Menger determinant for four points in 3D space is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and column are 0,1,1,1,1 and then the other entries are the squares of the distances.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the structure.

The Cayley-Menger determinant matrix is as follows:

- The (0,0) element is 0.
- The (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) are 1.
- The (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) are 1.
- The (i,j) elements for i,j >=1 are the squared distances between points i and j.

Wait, but the points are labeled as A, B, C, D, so in the matrix, the rows and columns correspond to points 0 (which is perhaps the origin or a dummy variable?), 1 (A), 2 (B), 3 (C), 4 (D). Hmm, maybe I should label the points as points 1 through 4, so the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD²
Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD²
Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD²
Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0

Yes, that seems right. So let me plug in the values:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

So the determinant of this matrix will give me 288 V², so V = sqrt(CM / 288). Let me compute this determinant.

Calculating a 5x5 determinant can be a bit tedious, but maybe there's some symmetry I can exploit. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, so it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. For a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c²) )) / (6√2)

Wait, no, maybe that's not the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices to compute the volume.

Let me try that. Assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron.

Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps it's symmetric, so maybe I can place the points in a coordinate system such that the centroid is at the origin, and the edges are symmetric.

Alternatively, maybe set point A at (x, y, z), B at (-x, -y, z), C at (-x, y, -z), and D at (x, -y, -z). This might give the necessary symmetry since the opposite edges would have the same lengths.

Let me see. Let me denote the coordinates as:

A = (
