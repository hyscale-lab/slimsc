Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully and try to understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, they want to know how many minutes the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Alright, so the key here is to find out the time it takes when her walking speed is s + 1/2 km/h. But to do that, I need to first find the values of s and t. Because the time includes the coffee shop time t, which is constant in both scenarios.

Let me start by noting down the information given.

First scenario:
- Speed: s km/h
- Total time taken: 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes of coffee shop.

Second scenario:
- Speed: s + 2 km/h
- Total time taken: 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes walking time plus t minutes.

Wait, the total time includes both walking and the coffee stop. So, for each scenario, the total time is the time taken to walk 9 km plus t minutes.

But wait, time is in hours for the first scenario and in hours and minutes for the second. I need to convert everything into consistent units, probably minutes, to make it easier, or keep it in hours if possible.

Let me think about converting t to hours because the speeds are in km per hour.

Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert all time into hours. So, t is in minutes, so I can express it as t/60 hours.

Let me define:

In the first case:
Time taken to walk 9 km at speed s is (9/s) hours. Then, she stops for t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So the total time is (9/s) + (t/60) = 4 hours.

Similarly, in the second case:
Time taken to walk 9 km at speed s+2 is (9/(s+2)) hours. Plus t/60 hours of coffee stop. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Now, 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.

So, we can write two equations:

1) (9/s) + (t/60) = 4
2) (9/(s+2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

Hmm, okay, so now I have two equations with two variables: s and t. I can solve these equations to find s and t.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: (9/s) + (t/60) = 4

Equation 2: (9/(s+2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

Now, if I subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1, the t/60 terms will cancel out. That should give me an equation to solve for s.

So, subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

So, 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Let me combine the two fractions on the left side.

First, factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 1.6
