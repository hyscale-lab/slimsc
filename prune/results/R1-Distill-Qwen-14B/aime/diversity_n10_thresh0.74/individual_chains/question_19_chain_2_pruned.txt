Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall some properties and formulas related to circumcenters, incenters, and their relations.

First, the circumradius R is given as 13. The inradius r is 6. I remember that the circumradius is related to the sides of the triangle and the area by the formula R = (a b c) / (4Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. The inradius is related to the area and the semiperimeter, r = Δ / s, where s is (a + b + c)/2.

Also, the position of the incenter and circumcenter: I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like an important condition. I need to find a relationship that involves IA, OI, and the sides of the triangle.

Wait, IA is one of the angle bisectors from vertex A to the inradius. OI is the line connecting the incenter and circumcenter. So they are perpendicular.

I think there might be a formula or theorem related to the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. Let me recall. Yes, the formula is OI² = R(R - 2r). Is that correct? Let me check the formula. Oh wait, yes, in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So OI² = R(R - 2r).

Given R =13, r=6, so OI² =13*(13 - 12)=13*(1)=13. So OI = sqrt(13).

But wait, in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So the line IA is perpendicular to OI, which is of length sqrt(13).

Hmm, maybe I can consider triangle OIA, where IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right triangle with right angle at A. Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Wait, no. Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at the point where IA meets OI. But IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is a segment from O to I. So the angle between IA and OI is at point I. So triangle OIA is right-angled at I.

Wait, no. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So the point where they meet is I, so triangle OIA is right-angled at I. So in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees.

Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = OI² + IA². But OA is the distance from O to A, which is the circumradius R. So OA =13.

So, OA² = OI² + IA² => 13² = OI² + IA².

We already calculated OI² =13, so 169 = 13 + IA² => IA²=169 -13=156. Thus IA = sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, that's the length of IA. Maybe I can relate IA to other properties.

I remember that the length of the angle bisector from A to the inradius can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides.

Wait, IA is actually the distance from the incenter to vertex A, right? So the formula for IA is known. Let me recall: IA = r / sin(A/2). Is that correct?

Yes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as IA = r / sin(A/2). Because in the triangle, the inradius is related to
