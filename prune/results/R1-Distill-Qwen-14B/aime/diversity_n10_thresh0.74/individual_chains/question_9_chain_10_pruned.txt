Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to find the value of xy where x and y are both real numbers greater than 1. The problem says that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but they have certain properties that might help me here. Let me write down what I know:

Given that log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

I think I should try to convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. I recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So let's apply that.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. So, converting this to exponential form, it should be x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Converting this, we get y^10 = x^{4y}.

Now I have two equations:

1) x^10 = y^x
2) y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay, so I have x and y both raised to powers related to each other. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

Looking at equation 1: x^10 = y^x. Let's take the x-th root of both sides to solve for y. So y = x^{10/x}.

Similarly, equation 2 is y^10 = x^{4y}. Maybe I can substitute y from equation 1 into this equation.

So substituting y = x^{10/x} into equation 2:

(x^{10/x})^10 = x^{4y}.

Let me simplify the left side. (x^{10/x})^10 = x^{(10/x)*10} = x^{100/x}.

So now the equation is x^{100/x} = x^{4y}.

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, I can set the exponents equal to each other:

100/x = 4y.

So from this, y = (100/x)/4 = 25/x.

Wait, so now I have y expressed as 25/x. But earlier from equation 1, we also have y = x^{10/x}.

So setting these two expressions for y equal to each other:

25/x = x^{10/x}.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me write that equation down:

25/x = x^{10/x}.

I need to solve for x here. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make this equation more manageable.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln(25/x) = ln(x^{10/x}) 

Which simplifies to:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Let me rearrange the terms to bring all the ln(x) terms to one side.

ln(25) = (10/x) * ln(x) + ln(x).

Factor out ln(x):

ln(25) = ln(x) * (10/x + 1).

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe I can let t = ln(x), then x = e^t.

Let me try substituting t = ln(x). Then, since x = e^t, we can express 10/x as 10 e^{-t}, and 1/x is e^{-t}.

So substituting into the equation:

ln(25) = t * (10 e^{-t} + 1).

Hmm, that's still a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange it:

ln(25) = t + 10 t e^{-t}.

This looks like a transcendental equation, which might not have a straightforward algebraic solution. Maybe I can make an intelligent guess for t or find a clever substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of x and see if I can find a relationship that allows me to solve for x.

Wait, let's go back a bit. We have y = 25/x, and y = x^{10/x}.

So, 25/x = x^{10/x}.

Let me denote z = x^{1/x}. So, z = x^{1/x}, which is a function that has a maximum at x = e, where z â‰ˆ 1.444. So, x^{1/x} decreases as x moves away from e in either direction.

Wait, but 25/x = x^{10/x} can be written as (x^{1/x})^10 = 25/x.

Since z = x^{1/x}, then z^10 = 25/x.

But z = x^{1/x}, so x = z^{-x}.

Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Let me think differently.

Wait, another approach: take the equation 25/x = x^{10/x} and raise both sides to the power of x.

So, (25/x)^x = (x^{10/x})^x.

Simplify the right side: x^{10/x * x} = x^{10}.

Left side: (25/x)^x = 25^x / x^x.

So, 25^x / x^x = x^{10}.

Multiply both sides by x^x:

25^x
