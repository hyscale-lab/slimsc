Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Then, once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me break this down. I think I should start by considering small primes and checking whether n⁴ +1 is divisible by p² for some n. The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. I need to find the smallest p where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Wait, so for each prime p, I need to check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². If such an n exists, then p is a candidate. But p² has to divide n⁴ +1, which is a stronger condition than just p dividing n⁴ +1.

I remember that for primes p, if -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, then maybe it can also be a quartic residue modulo p², but I'm not sure. Maybe I should recall some number theory here.

First, let me think about the equation n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So for this to hold, n⁴ must be congruent to -1 modulo p². That implies that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then it's certainly true mod p.

So, first, for each prime p, I need to check whether -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. Because if it's not, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² can't hold. So, I should find primes p where -1 is a quartic residue mod p.

I remember that for a prime p, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/2, or something like that.

Wait, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, so the equation x⁴ = a mod p has a solution only if a^{(p-1)/d} ≡ 1 mod p, where d is gcd(4, p-1). So, for x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, (-1)^{(p-1)/d} must ≡ 1 mod p.

Wait, maybe I should think about the exponent. Let me see: if x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then raising both sides to the (p-1)/4th power if possible... Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, I know that in the multiplicative group, the equation x⁴ = -1 would mean that the order of x is 8, because (x⁴)^2 = x^8 = (-1)^2 = 1 mod p. So, the order of x is 8, which must divide the order of the group, which is p-1. Therefore, 8 must divide p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but wait, if x⁴ = -1, then x^8 = 1. So, the order of x is 8, so 8 divides p-1. So, p must be 1 mod 8. So, the primes p for which -1 is a quartic residue modulo p are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8.

But wait, is that the only condition? Let me think. For example, let's take p=17, which is 1 mod 8. Let's see if x⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17 has a solution.

Compute -1 mod 17 is 16. Let me try some numbers:

1^4 = 1
2^4 = 16 → 16 ≡ -1 mod 17. Oh, so yes, 2⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17. So, 2 is a solution. So, p=17 works.

But wait, p=17 is 1 mod 8, yes. So, primes p ≡1 mod 8 will have x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p solvable.

But then, what about p=7? p=7 is 7 mod 8. Does x⁴ ≡ -1 mod 7 have a solution? Let me check.

Compute 3^4: 8
