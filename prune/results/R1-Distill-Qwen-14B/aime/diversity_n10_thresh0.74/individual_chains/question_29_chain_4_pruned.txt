Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Hmm, rectangles, so all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. I need to find the length of CE.

Given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184. So, let me try to visualize this. Let me draw a rough sketch.

First, rectangle ABCD. Let's label the points: A, B, C, D. So, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, AB is the longer side, BC is the shorter side. So, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is 107 units, BC is 16 units.

Then, there's another rectangle EFGH. So, points E, F, G, H. Given that FG=17, EF=184. So, EF is the longer side, FG is the shorter side. So, EFGH is a rectangle with EF=184 and FG=17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that's a straight line. So, D is connected to E, E to C, C to F. So, the line goes through D, E, C, F. Hmm. So, D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are adjacent corners of rectangle EFGH.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That's an important piece of information because cyclic quadrilaterals have properties that opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, and the power of a point applies.

So, the goal is to find CE. CE is part of the line that goes through D, E, C, F. So, CE is the segment from C to E. Since E is between D and C (assuming the order D-E-C-F), then CE = CD + DE? Wait, no. Wait, if D-E-C-F are collinear, then the order is D, E, C, F. So, from D to E to C to F. So, DE is the segment from D to E, EC is from E to C, and CF is from C to F.

Wait, but in the problem, we have rectangles ABCD and EFGH. So, for rectangle ABCD, points are A, B, C, D, in order. So, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, ABCD is arranged such that AB is the base, BC is the height.

Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, with EF=184, FG=17. So, EF is the base, FG is the height.

But since D, E, C, F are collinear, I need to figure out how these rectangles are placed relative to each other.

Also, the fact that A, D, H, G lie on a circle is crucial. Maybe using the cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates can help. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC=16, AB=107, so let's see.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, AB is the length, BC is the width.

If I place D at (0,0), then C would be at (16,0), because BC is 16. Then, B would be at (16,107), and A would be at (0,107). Wait, no, that can't be because in a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.

Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates more carefully.

Let me consider rectangle ABCD. Let me assign point D at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, the sides
