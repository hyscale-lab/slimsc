Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm. First, let me visualize this. Rectangles have right angles, so ABCD and EFGH are both rectangles with four right angles. The sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all sides of the first rectangle, and EF, FG, GH, HE are the sides of the second rectangle.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, that means all four points lie on a straight line. So, the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. So if I imagine the two rectangles placed next to each other, with one rectangle attached to the other, but in some way that these points are aligned.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. This could be useful because if four points lie on a circle, certain geometric properties must hold, like the power of a point or cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16: Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one of the sides. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AD = BC = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Wait, no: wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if AB is given as 107, then CD is also 107, and BC is 16, so AD is 16. So the sides of rectangle ABCD are 107 and 16.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF = 184 and FG = 17. So the sides of EFGH are 184 and 17. So EF is 184, FG is 17, GH is 184, and HE is 17.

I need to find CE. CE is the distance from point C to point E. Since C and E are on the same line (D, E, C, F are collinear), CE is just the distance between C and E on that line.

So perhaps I need to find the coordinates of points C and E, then compute the distance between them.

Wait, maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Let me try setting up a coordinate system.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and let's say AB is horizontal, so moving from A to B is along the x-axis, and from B to C is along the y-axis.

Wait, but actually, in rectangle ABCD, the sides AB and BC are adjacent. So if AB is 107, BC is 16, then the coordinates need to be set accordingly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to assign coordinates such that point D is at (0,0), and the rectangle ABCD has sides along the axes. So, since D is at (0,0), and if ABCD is a rectangle, then point C would be at (16, 0), because DC is 16 (since BC = 16, and in a rectangle, DC = AB = 107? Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, BC is 16. So AB is the length, BC is the width. So, if I assign coordinates, I need to make sure that the sides correspond correctly.

Let me think again. Let me define the rectangle ABCD such that:

- Point A is at (0,0)
- Point B is at (107, 0)
- Point C is at (107, 16)
- Point D is at (0, 16)

Wait, that makes sense because AB is 107 units, BC is 16 units, CD is 107 units, and DA is 16 units.

But then, where are the other points? EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So D is at (0,16), E is somewhere on the line DC... Wait, no, because E, C, F are collinear with D. Wait, D, E, C, F are on the same line.

Wait, maybe D is at (0,16), and E is somewhere on the extension beyond D or C. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should reorient the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to have point D at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and AD is 1
