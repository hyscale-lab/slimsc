Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These are in the first quadrant, so all coordinates are positive. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length, where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and the segment PQ lies entirely in the first quadrant.

So, each PQ is a line segment from P on the x-axis to Q on the y-axis, with length 1. Since they're in the first quadrant, both P and Q have positive coordinates. Also, because the length is 1, PQ is a line segment of length 1 between the axes.

Now, the problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is one of the segments in F, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB.

Calculating AB's length: distance between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Using distance formula, sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, C is a point on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F. So, for all other segments PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. And C is unique in that sense.

We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm. So, how to approach this?

First, let's parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parametrized as follows. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1, and at t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So, the parametric equations would be x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2) t. Because moving from A to B, x decreases from 1/2 to 0, and y increases from 0 to sqrt(3)/2.

So, point C can be represented as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

Our goal is to find C such that it doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, for any other PQ in F, the point C shouldn't lie on PQ.

But how can we find such a point C? Maybe we can find equations for all possible PQ in F and then ensure that C isn't on any of them except AB.

Wait, but that seems too broad. There are infinitely many PQ in F. So, perhaps we can find the locus of all points lying on at least one PQ in F, and then find the point C on AB that isn't in that locus except for AB itself.

Alternatively, perhaps we can characterize all possible PQ segments in F, find the envelope of all such segments, and then see where AB intersects this envelope. Because the point C would be where AB is tangent to the envelope, so it's the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence not lying on any other PQ except AB.

Wait, that might be a good approach. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family F consists of straight line segments PQ. So, the envelope would be a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. Any point on the envelope lies on exactly one PQ from F, and points not on the envelope lie on zero or multiple PQs.

Therefore, if we can find such an envelope, then the point C should be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because at that point, C lies on AB and on the envelope, so it's only on AB and no other PQ. All other points on AB would lie inside the envelope, hence would lie on some other PQ segments.

So, we need to find the envelope of all segments PQ in F, then find the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

How do we find the envelope of the family
