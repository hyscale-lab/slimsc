Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention expressing this probability as a reduced fraction m/n and then finding m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, first, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue independently. So, the total number of colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's the denominator for the probability because each coloring is equally likely.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. So, essentially, if we think of the octagon as having positions labeled 0 through 7, and each vertex is colored either red or blue, we can rotate the octagon by some number of positions (0 through 7) such that every blue vertex in the rotated octagon was red in the original.

Wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. After rotation, all blue vertices in the new arrangement were originally red. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the original coloring and the rotated coloring.

Let me rephrase: We need that the set of blue vertices in some rotated version is a subset of the red vertices in the original. Because when we rotate, each blue vertex moves to a new position, and we want each of those new positions to have been red originally. So, the image of the blue set under rotation must be a subset of the red set.

Alternatively, the blue set must be a subset of the red set under some rotation. Wait, that might not be exactly right. Let me think again.

Suppose the original octagon has some blue vertices. If we rotate the octagon by k positions, each blue vertex moves to position (original_pos + k) mod 8. For the rotated octagon to satisfy the condition, every blue vertex in the rotated position must have been red in the original. So, the set of positions that are blue after rotation (which is the original blue positions shifted by k) must be entirely within the original red positions.

So, mathematically, if B is the set of blue vertices in the original coloring, then for some rotation k, (B + k) mod 8 must be a subset of R, where R is the set of red vertices in the original. But since R is the complement of B, R = [8] \ B. So, (B + k) mod 8 must be a subset of [8] \ B.

Alternatively, (B + k) âˆ© B = empty set.

Which means that shifting the set B by k gives a set that doesn't intersect B. So, B and (B + k) are disjoint.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets B of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} such that there exists some k where (B + k) is disjoint from B. Then, the probability would be that number divided by 256.

But wait, each vertex is colored red or blue independently, so each subset B corresponds to a coloring where B is blue and the rest are red. So, the number of such subsets is exactly the number of colorings
