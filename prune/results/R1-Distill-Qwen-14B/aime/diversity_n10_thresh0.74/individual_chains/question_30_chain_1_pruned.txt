Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000. The catch is that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a 13th root of unity is. It's a complex number that satisfies the equation \(\omega^{13} = 1\). So, these roots are solutions to the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). They are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane. Since \(\omega \neq 1\), we're dealing with the primitive 13th roots, right?

Now, the product we're supposed to compute is from \(k=0\) to \(k=12\). That's all the 13th roots of unity. So, for each root \(\omega^k\), we're plugging it into the expression \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Then, we're multiplying all these together.

Wait a minute, that seems like a lot of terms. Maybe there's a smarter way to handle this product rather than computing each term individually. Let me think about the properties of roots of unity and how they can be used in products like this.

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of terms like \((x - \omega^k)\) over all primitive roots gives the cyclotomic polynomial. But here, the expression inside the product is more complicated: \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Maybe I can factor this expression or rewrite it in a way that relates to cyclotomic polynomials or some known products.

Let me try to manipulate the expression \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Let's factor out a 2 from the first two terms: \(2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}\). Hmm, I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as a quadratic in \(\omega^k\). Let's see:

Let \(x = \omega^k\). Then the expression becomes \(2 - 2x + x^2\), which is \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). That's a quadratic in x. So, each term in the product is \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) evaluated at \(x = \omega^k\). Therefore, the entire product is \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\) evaluated at each 13th root of unity.

Wait, but when \(k\) goes from 0 to 12, \(x = \omega^k\) covers all the 13th roots of unity. So, I'm essentially taking the product over all 13th roots of unity of the
