Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let's see.

First, all variables x, y, z are positive real numbers, which is good because logs are defined for positive numbers. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

I need to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. Let me try to solve for x, y, z first using the given equations.

I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in terms of log x, log y, log z.

Let me denote:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

Then, the equations become:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = log₂ x - log₂ y - log₂ z = a - b - c = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = log₂ y - log₂ x - log₂ z = b - a - c = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = log₂ z - log₂ x - log₂ y = c - a - b = 1/4

So now, I have a system of three equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2  ...(1)
2. -a + b - c = 1/3 ...(2)
3. -a - b + c = 1/4 ...(3)

Hmm, let's write these equations clearly:

Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2

Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let's try to add equations or manipulate them.

If I add equations (1) and (2):

(1)+(2): (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Which simplifies to: 0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6 (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 =5/6)

So, -2c =5/6 → c = -5/(12)

Wait, hold on, c is log₂ z, which is a real number, but negative. Since z is positive, log can be negative. That's okay.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's plug c into another equation. Let's take equation (1):

a - b - (-5/12) = 1/2 → a - b +5/12 =1/2

So, a - b = 1/2 -5/12 = (6/12 -5/12) =1/12 → a - b =1/12 ...(4)

Similarly, take equation (2):

- a + b - (-5/12) =1/3 → -a + b +5/12 =1/3

So, -a + b =1/3 -5/12 = (4/12 -5/12)= -1/12 → -a + b = -1/12 ...(5)

Now, equations (4) and (5):

(4): a - b =1/12

(5): -a + b = -1/12

If I add (4) and (5):

(a -a) + (-b +b) =1/12 -1/12 → 0=0. Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe I can solve for a or b.

From (4): a = b +1/12

Plugging into (5):

-(b +1/12) + b = -1/12 → -b -1/12 + b = -1/12 → -1/12 = -1/12. Well, that's an identity, so it doesn't give new info.

So perhaps I need to use equation (3). Let's recall equation (3):

- a - b + c =1/4

We know c is -5/12, so:

- a - b -5/12 =1/4 → -a -b =1/4 +5/12 = 3/12 +5/12=8/12=2/3

So, -a - b =2/3 → a + b= -2/3 ...(6)

But from equation (4): a = b +1/12. Plugging into equation (6):

(b +1/12) + b = -2/3 → 2b +1/12 = -2/3

Subtract 1/12: 2b = -2/3 -1/12 = (-8/12 -1/12)= -9/12= -3/4

So, 2b = -3/4 → b= -3/8

Then from equation (4): a = b +1/12= (-3/8) +1/12

Convert to common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24, and 1/12=2/24. So a= (-9/24 +2/24)= (-7)/24

So a = -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.

So, let me recap:

a = log₂ x = -7/24 → x=2^(-7/24)

b = log₂ y = -3/8 → y=2^(-3/8)

c = log₂ z = -5/12 → z=2^(-5/12)

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute this expression:

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) =4 log₂ x +3 log₂ y +2 log₂ z

Substituting a, b, c:

=4a +3b +2c =4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)

Compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6

3*(-3/8)= (-9)/8

2*(-5/12)= (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

So adding them all:

(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Combine like terms:

First, combine (-7/6) and (-5/6): (-12/6)= -2

Then add (-9/8): -2 + (-9/8) = (-16/8 -9/8)= (-25)/8

So log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -25/8. The absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25 and n=8. They are coprime.

Thus, m + n =25+8=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\).

First, we define:
\[
a = \log_2 x, \quad b = \log_2 y, \quad c = \log_2 z
\]

The given equations translate to:
1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) becomes \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) becomes \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) becomes \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

We solve this system of equations step-by-step:

1. Adding equations (1) and (2):
   \[
   (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \implies -2c = \frac{5}{6} \implies c = -\frac{5}{12}
   \]

2. Using equation (1) with \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\):
   \[
   a - b + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \implies a - b = \frac{1}{12}
   \]

3. Using equation (2) with \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\):
   \[
   -a + b + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \implies -a + b = -\frac{1}{12}
   \]

4. From the above, we have:
   \[
   a - b = \frac{1}{12} \quad \text{and} \quad -a + b = -\frac{1}{12}
   \]
   Adding these, we find \(0 = 0\), which is consistent.

5. Using equation (3) with \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\):
   \[
   -a - b - \frac{5}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \implies -a - b = \frac{2}{3} \implies a + b = -\frac{2}{3}
   \]

6. Solving the system:
   \[
   a = b + \frac{1}{12} \quad \text{and} \quad a + b = -\frac{2}{3}
   \]
   Substituting \(a\) into the second equation:
   \[
   (b + \frac{1}{12}) + b = -\frac{2}{3} \implies 2b + \frac{1}{12} = -\frac{2}{3} \implies 2b = -\frac{9}{12} \implies b = -\frac{3}{8}
   \]
   Then, \(a = -\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{12} = -\frac{7}{24}\).

Thus, we have:
\[
a = -\frac{7}{24}, \quad b = -\frac{3}{8}, \quad c = -\frac{5}{12}
\]

Next, we compute \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\):
\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}
\]
Converting to a common denominator:
\[
-\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]
Taking the absolute value:
\[
\left|-\frac{25}{8}\right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, the value is \(\frac{25}{8}\), and \(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
