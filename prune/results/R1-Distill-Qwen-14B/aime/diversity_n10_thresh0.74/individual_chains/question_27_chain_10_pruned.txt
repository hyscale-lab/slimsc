Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The torus is made by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, imagine a donut shape where the distance from the center of the original circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the circle being revolved is 3. Got it.

Then there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside and outside of this sphere. When it's inside and tangent, they touch along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside and tangent, they touch along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, which will be a fraction m/n, and then compute m + n where m and n are coprime.

Alright, so I think I need to find the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere in both cases. Let me try to model this.

First, let's recall some properties of a torus. A torus can be described in 3D coordinates with two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, R is 6, and r is 3. So, the standard equation for a torus is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

But since we're dealing with a sphere, the equation of the sphere is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the point(s) of tangency will lie along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the tangency is along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and the sphere are tangent. Since both are surfaces of revolution around the same axis (assuming the axis of the torus is aligned with the sphere's center), the circles of tangency should lie in a plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution.

So, let's imagine the axis of the torus is the z-axis. The sphere is centered at the origin, and so is the torus? Wait, no. Actually, when the torus is resting inside the sphere, the center of the torus is at the origin, right? Because the sphere is centered at the origin and the torus is placed inside. Similarly, when it's resting outside, perhaps the torus is centered at the origin as well, but the sphere is inside the torus? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The torus is created by revolving a circle around an axis. So, if the sphere is of radius 11, and the torus is inside, the center of the torus (the center of the tube) would be 6 units from the origin, but wait no, R is 6, so the center of the tube is at a distance R from the origin, so 6 units. But the sphere is of radius 11, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere when placed accordingly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus in 3D coordinates. Let me consider the standard parametrization.

For a torus with major radius R and minor radius r, the parametrization is:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

where θ and φ are angles varying from 0 to 2π.

In this case, R = 6, r = 3.

So, the equation for the torus can be written as:

√(x² + y²) = R + r cos θ

But since θ is a parameter, perhaps it's better to relate it using the standard torus equation:

(√(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.

Yes, that's correct.

So, for the torus:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9.

Now, the sphere is x² + y² + z² = 121.

We need to find the points where the torus is tangent to the sphere both internally and externally.

Let me think about the internal tangency first. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the point(s) of tangency lie on both surfaces and their normals are in the same direction at those points.

Similarly, for external tangency, the normals are in opposite directions.

But maybe there's a simpler way. Since both are surfaces of revolution, the points of tangency should lie on a circle that is a cross-section perpendicular to the axis of revolution (the z-axis in our case).

So, perhaps I can consider a cross-sectional view in the x-z plane, which is a 2D problem.

In 2D, the torus would be a circle of radius 3, centered at (6, 0), and revolved around the z-axis to form the torus. But wait, in 2D cross-section, the torus would appear as two circles, but actually, in the cross-section, each point on the torus's tube would be a circle. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating.

Wait, perhaps treating the 3D problem as a 2D problem using cross-sections.

Let me consider a cross-section in the x-z plane. In this plane, the sphere of radius 11 is represented by the circle x² + z² = 121.

The torus in this cross-section would be the original circle of radius
