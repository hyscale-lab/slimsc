Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD, and I need to find the distance from the incenter to each face. Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, kind of like the 3D version of the incenter in a triangle. That distance is called the inradius, I think.

The given tetrahedron has edges with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). So, each pair of opposite edges is equal. That probably means the tetrahedron is "isohedral" or something? Wait, no, isohedral usually means all faces are the same, which might not be the case here. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.

Since I need to find the inradius, I recall that in a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius (r) is related to the volume (V) and the surface area (A). The formula is similar to the 2D case: r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Or wait, is it 3V over the sum of the areas of the four faces? Yes, I think so. So, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area.

First, let me find the volume. But wait, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edge lengths? I think it's called the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me recall the formula.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.

The Cayley-Menger matrix is a 5x5 matrix:

0   1    1    1    1
1   0   a²  b²  c²
1  a²   0   d²  e²
1  b²  d²   0   f²
1  c²  e²  f²   0

So, I need to plug in the given edge lengths. Let me list the edges:

AB = sqrt(41) ⇒ a² = 41
AC = sqrt(80) ⇒ b² = 80
AD = sqrt(89) ⇒ c² = 89
BC = sqrt(89) ⇒ d² = 89
BD = sqrt(80) ⇒ e² = 80
CD = sqrt(41) ⇒ f² = 41

So, plugging these into the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me make sure. The second row corresponds to AB, AC, AD, which are a, b, c. So, the second row is 1, 0, a², b², c². Similarly, the third row is 1, a², 0, d², e². So yeah, the matrix looks correct.

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. That's going to be a bit involved, but let's try to compute it step by step.

The matrix is:

0  1    1    1    1
1  0   41   80   89
1 41    0   89   80
1 80   89    0   41
1 89   80   41    0

Calculating the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is tedious. Maybe I can use expansion by minors or row operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's some symmetry here that can help. Let me look at the matrix again.

Each of the off-diagonal elements in the lower 4x4 submatrix seems to have a pattern. Let me denote the matrix as M.

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

I notice that rows 2,3,4 are permutations of each other. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can subtract row 1 from rows 2,3,4,5 to create zeros in the first column.

Let me try that. Let's perform row operations:

Row2 = Row2 - Row1
Row3 = Row3 - Row1
Row4 = Row4 - Row1
Row5 = Row5 - Row1

But wait, in this case, rows 2 to 5 are 1,41,0,89,80; etc. So subtracting row1 (which is [1,0,41,80,89]) from each.

So:

Row2 becomes: [1-1, 0-0, 41-41, 80-80, 89-89] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, actually, the first element after the first is 1,0,41,80,89. So row1 is [1,0,41,80,89]. So when subtracting row1 from row2:

Row2: [1,41,0,89,80] - [1,0,41,80,89] = [0,41,-41,9,-9]. Hmm, that's better.

Similarly, Row3: [1,80,89,0,41] - [1,0,41,80,89] = [0,80,48,-80,-48]

Row4: [1,89,80,41,0] - [1,0,41,80,89] = [0,89,39,-39,-89]

Wait, that seems messy, but perhaps manageable.

Let me write down the transformed matrix after these row operations.

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9
Row3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48
Row4: 0,89,39,-39,-89

Now, since the first column has 0s except for the first element, the determinant can be computed by expanding along the first column.

The determinant is equal to the sum of the elements in the first column multiplied by their cofactors. Since the first column only has 0s except for Row0 and Row1, but wait, Row0 is 0,1,1,1,1, so the first element is 0. So, actually, only Row1 has 1 in the first column. So, the determinant is (-1)
