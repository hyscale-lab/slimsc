Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for their color. We need to place some of these chips in the 25 cells of a 5x5 grid with certain conditions.

First condition: Each cell can have at most one chip. That's straightforward—no overfilling cells.

Second condition: All chips in the same row must be the same color. Similarly, all chips in the same column must be the same color. So, each row is either all white, all black, or empty? Wait, no—wait, no. Each row must have all chips of the same color, but the row can be either all white, all black, or have no chips at all. Similarly for the columns.

Wait, but if a row has chips, they must all be the same color. Same for columns. So, for example, if row 1 has any chips, they're all white or all black. Same for every other row. Same for each column.

Third condition: Any additional chip placed would violate the previous two conditions. That means the arrangement is maximal—adding any more chips isn't possible without breaking the row or column color uniformity.

So, the task is to count the number of such maximal arrangements.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how the grid can be colored under these constraints.

Since each row must have all chips of the same color or be empty, but the same goes for each column, it's a bit of a constraint on both rows and columns. So perhaps the arrangement is such that the grid is divided into regions of same-colored blocks, but with the added constraint that each row and column is uniform.

Wait, but if a row has some chips, all must be the same color. Same for a column.

Wait, but if a row is all white, then every column that intersects this row must either be all white or not have any chips in that column. Because if a column has a white chip in this row, then the entire column must be white. But if the column has no chips in this row, it could be black elsewhere or remain empty.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Suppose in row 1, we have all white chips. Then, in each column that has a white chip in row 1
