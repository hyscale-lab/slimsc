Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. Also, it's mentioned that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four items.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that this is a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how that works. Inclusion-exclusion is a way to calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. But in this problem, we're given specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three, which might help us avoid having to calculate the overlaps directly.

Wait, so the problem gives the number of residents who own exactly two of the three items (excluding the candy hearts, which everyone has). And then 234 own exactly three. But wait, isn't the candy hearts included in all of these? Wait, no, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So candy hearts are universal, meaning everyone has them. So when they talk about the residents owning diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, they are in addition to the candy hearts.

So, the four items each person can own are: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. So, the problem is asking for the number of residents who own all four. But since everyone already has the candy hearts, the people who own all four are essentially the ones who have all three of the other items plus the candy hearts.

Wait, but the problem says that 437 own exactly two of these things. So, does that mean exactly two of the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade? Because everyone has the candy hearts, so when someone owns exactly two of the other three, they have candy hearts plus two of the other
