Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All opposite sides are parallel, and the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral, all sides are equal in length, but they're not necessarily regular since the angles can vary. Also, opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, they will meet to form a triangle. Let me imagine this: extending AB and CD, they meet at some point, and similarly for the other sides. So the triangle is larger, and the hexagon is sort of inscribed within this triangle.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side has the same length, let's say 's'. Now, I need to relate this 's' to the sides of the triangle which are 200, 240, and 300. I think similar triangles might come into play here.

Let me denote the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD, Q is the intersection of CD and EF, and R is the intersection of EF and AB. So the sides of triangle PQR are PQ=200, QR=240, and RP=300. Or maybe I have the sides mixed up, but the idea is that each side corresponds to the extended sides of the hexagon.

Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon and are being extended to form triangle PQR, the hexagon is like a section inside this triangle. Each side of the hexagon is a segment between two points on the sides of triangle PQR.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of proportions. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the distances from each side of the hexagon to the triangle PQR's sides should be proportional.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry would help. Let me place the triangle PQR in a coordinate system. Let's put point P at (0,0), Q at (240,0), and R somewhere in the plane. Wait, but triangle sides are 200, 240, 300. Let me assign the sides correctly.

Wait, triangle PQR has sides of 200, 240, 300. Let's make sure which sides correspond. Let's let PQ=240, QR=200, and RP=300. So, in coordinate terms, let me place point P at (0,0). Then, point Q is at (240,0). Point R is somewhere such that PR=300 and QR=200.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the coordinates of R. Let me use the distance formula. Let’s suppose R is at (x,y). Then, the distance from P(0,0) to R(x,y) is 300, so sqrt(x² + y²) = 300. The distance from Q(240,0) to R(x,y) is 200, so sqrt((x-240)² + y²) = 200.

So, squaring both equations:

x² + y² = 90000

(x - 240)² + y² = 40000

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

x² + y² - [(x² - 480x + 57600) + y²] = 90000 - 40000

Simplify:

x² + y² - x² + 480x -57600 - y² = 50000

So, 480x -57600 =
