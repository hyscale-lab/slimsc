Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all opposite sides are parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, and it's given that the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, alright, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me visualize the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral, all its sides are equal in length, let's denote each side by 's'. Also, the fact that opposite sides are parallel gives it some kind of symmetry. I remember that in such hexagons, the sides can be thought of as vectors that add up to zero because it's a closed polygon. So, maybe vector analysis could be useful here.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about that. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, these lines will meet at some points forming a triangle. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. I wonder if this triangle has any special properties, like being a right triangle or something else. Let me check if 200² + 240² equals 300². Calculating, 200² is 40,000, 240² is 57,600, adding those gives 97,600. 300² is 90,000. Nope, that's not equal, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm, okay.

Maybe I should think about similar triangles or some proportionality here. Since the sides of the hexagon are equal and the opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of these sides might form similar triangles with the main triangle given. 

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. The hexagon is convex, so all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Opposite sides are AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA, right? Wait, no, the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I should clarify the opposite sides. In a hexagon, each side has an opposite one. So, in ABCDEF, AB is opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, CD opposite to FA. Each pair is parallel.

So, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, those lines meet at some points to form a triangle. Let me denote the triangle as T, with sides 200, 240, 300. I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon.

Since opposite sides are parallel, perhaps the hexagon is similar to a smaller hexagon inside this triangle T? Or maybe the triangle T is an affine transformation of the hexagon? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle T is formed by three of the extended sides, and the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle in some way. Maybe each side of the hexagon corresponds to a portion of the sides of triangle T.

Wait, another approach. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex
