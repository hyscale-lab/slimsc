Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, an equilateral hexagon has all sides equal, right? So each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA is the same length, which we're trying to find. Also, opposite sides are parallel. That means AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Since it's a convex hexagon, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees, so the sides don't bend back on themselves.

Now, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they will meet at points forming a triangle. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. So, the triangle is probably larger than the hexagon, with the hexagon sitting inside it.

I remember that in such cases, the hexagon can be thought of as a section of the triangle, with each pair of opposite sides contributing to the triangle's sides. Since opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, the extensions of these sides will meet at points that form the triangle.

I think this might relate to similar triangles or maybe the concept of intercept theorems (also known as Thales' theorem). Maybe the hexagon divides the triangle into smaller similar triangles?

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal, each side is 's'.

The triangle formed by the extensions has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me denote the lengths of the segments from the vertices of the triangle to the hexagon as variables. Maybe if I can express the sides of the triangle in terms of 's' and these variables, I can solve for 's'.

Wait, but how exactly do the sides of the triangle relate to the hexagon's sides? Let me think. Each side of the triangle is formed by extending a side of the hexagon. Each extension beyond the hexagon will add a certain length to the triangle's side.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF will each form sides of the triangle, and the lengths of these extensions will be proportional based on how the hexagon is situated within the triangle.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is similar to the hexagon's structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: if I consider the hexagon within the triangle, each side of the hexagon is a part of the triangle's sides. But since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the triangle must have sides that are multiples of the hexagon's sides.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the triangle as being divided into smaller similar triangles by the hexagon. For example, each corner of the triangle could have a smaller triangle similar to the whole triangle, and the hexagon is in the center.

If that's the case, the sides of the triangle would be
