Okay, so I have this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand this. So, Bob is creating sets B where each B has a maximum element that's in A. Each B is a finite nonempty set, so for each such B, the largest number in B is in A. So, for example, if A is {1, 2}, then possible B sets could be {1}, {2}, {1,2}, {1,3} (but wait, no, because the maximum element of B must be in A. So if A is {1,2}, then the maximum of B can only be 1 or 2.

Wait, so if B is {1,3}, the maximum is 3, which isn't in A, so that wouldn't be included. So Bob's sets B are all finite nonempty sets where the maximum element is in A.

So, how do these sets B look? Let me think.

Suppose A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, where a1 < a2 < ... < an. So, A is a set of positive integers, maybe not necessarily consecutive.

Now, for each element ai in A, the sets B that have maximum ai can be formed by taking any subset of {1, 2, ..., ai} that includes ai and doesn't include any element larger than ai. Wait, no, that can't be right because B can have elements larger than ai, but then the maximum would be larger than ai, which is not in A. So, wait, no, Bob's sets B must have their maximum in A, which is a specific set of numbers.

Wait, so maybe B must consist of elements where all elements are less than or equal to some a_i in A. So, for each a_i, the number of possible sets B where the maximum is a_i is 2^{a_i - 1}. Because the other elements of B can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a_i - 1}, and you have to include a_i to make it the maximum. So the number of such sets for each a_i is 2^{a_i - 1}.

Wait, let me think about that again. For a given
