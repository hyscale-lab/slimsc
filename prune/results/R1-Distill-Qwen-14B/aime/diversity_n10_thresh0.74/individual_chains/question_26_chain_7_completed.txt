Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. I'm given the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find the length of AP, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me jot down what I know:

- Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.
- Circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC.
- Tangents at B and C meet at D.
- AD intersects ω again at P.
- Find AP.

I think I can start by recalling some properties of tangents to a circle. I remember that the tangent from a point to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, the tangent at B will be perpendicular to OB, and similarly, the tangent at C will be perpendicular to OC, where O is the center of ω.

But I'm not sure if I need to find the coordinates or use some theorem here. Maybe there's a theorem related to the point where two tangents meet and lines intersecting the circle again. Oh, right! There's the power of a point theorem. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC² since DB and DC are tangent lengths from D to ω.

Wait, yes, the power of point D is equal to DB² = DC². So, DB = DC. That makes triangle DBC isosceles with DB = DC.

But how does that help me find AP? Hmm.

I know that AD intersects ω again at P. So, AD is a secant line, and maybe I can use the power of point A with respect to ω. The power of A would be zero since A is on ω. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Maybe I should use power of point D instead.

Power of D: DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

Wait, that's right! Because D lies outside the circle, and AD is a secant. So, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DP * DA, which is equal to DB².

So, DB² = DP * DA.

But I don't know DB yet. Maybe I can compute DB in terms of the sides of triangle ABC.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Menelaus' theorem or something similar. Or maybe harmonic division? I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, D is the exsimilicenter of the circle ω with respect to triangle ABC. Maybe I can use some properties related to that.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to compute coordinates of D and then find where AD intersects the circle again.

Let me try that approach.

First, let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, since AC is 10, I can place point A at (10,0). Point B is somewhere in the plane, and I know AB=5 and BC=9. So, I can find the coordinates of B.

Let me assign coordinates:

- C = (0,0)
- A = (10, 0)
- B = (x, y), which I need to find.

Using the distances:

From A to B: sqrt( (x-10)^2 + y^2 ) = 5 → (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25 ... (1)

From B to C: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 9 → x^2 + y^2 = 81 ... (2)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

x^2 + y^2 - [ (x-10)^2 + y^2 ] = 81 - 25

Expanding (x-10)^2: x² -20x +100

So,

x² + y² - (x² -20x +100 + y² ) = 56

Simplify:

x² + y² -x² +20x -100 -y² = 56 → 20x -100 =56 → 20x = 156 → x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8

So, x is 39/5. Now, plug back into equation (2) to find y:

(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81

Compute (39/5)^2: 39²=1521, so 1521/25 + y² = 81.

Convert 81 to 2025/25.

So, 1521/25 + y² = 2025/25 → y² = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 → y = sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but 504= 16*31.5 is not an integer. Wait, 504= 16*31.5 is 504= 16 * 31.5 = 16*(63/2) )= 504. Hmm, perhaps better to factor 504.

504 factors: 504= 7 * 72 =7*8*9= 7*8*9 → sqrt(7*8*9)=sqrt(504)=sqrt(7*72)=sqrt(7*36*2)=6*sqrt(14). Wait, 504= 36*14, yes. Because 36*14=504. So, sqrt(504)=6*sqrt(14).

So, y=6*sqrt(14)/5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

Okay, so now I have coordinates for A, B, C:

A: (10, 0)
B: (39/5, 6√14/5)
C: (0,0)

Now, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω.

First, let me find the equation of the circumcircle ω. Since points A, B, C lie on ω, I can find its equation.

We can write the general equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Plugging in point C (0,0):

0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 → F=0.

So, equation is x² + y² + Dx + Ey =0.

Now, plugging in point A (10,0):

100 +0 +10D +0 =0 → 10D = -100 → D= -10.

So, equation becomes x² + y² -10x + Ey =0.

Now, plug in point B (39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) =0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

10*(39/5) = (10*39)/5=78.

E*(6√14/5) is (6√14/5)*E.

So, putting it all together:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6√14/5) E =0.

Compute 1521 +504=2025, so 2025/25=81.

So, 81 -78 + (6√14/5) E=0 → 3 + (6√14/5) E=0.

So, (6√14/5) E = -3 → E= (-3)*(5)/(6√14)= (-15)/(6√14)= (-5)/(2√14).

Rationalize denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(14):

E= (-5*sqrt(14))/(2*14)= (-5√14)/28.

So, equation of ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

So, the center O is at (-D/2, -E/2) → D=-10, so -D/2=5; E= -5√14/28, so -E/2= (5√14)/56.

Wait, let me compute that again. The standard form is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where h= -D/2, k= -E/2.

So, h= -(-10)/2=5, and k= -(-5√14/28)/2= (5√14/28)/2=5√14/56=5√14/(56).

So, center O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Now, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

But since we have the equation of the circle, the tangent at any point (x₁,y₁) on the circle is given by:

xx₁ + yy₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F =0.

Wait, or maybe another formula. Alternatively, the equation of the tangent can be found using the derivative or using the condition that the distance from the center equals the radius.

Alternatively, for a circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0, the tangent at point (x₁,y₁) is xx₁ + yy₁ + (D(x + x₁))/2 + (E(y + y₁))/2 + F=0.

Yes, that's correct.

So, for point C (0,0), the tangent is x*0 + y*0 + (D(x + 0))/2 + (E(y + 0))/2 + F=0 → (Dx)/2 + (Ey)/2 + F=0.

But since F=0, it's (Dx + Ey)/2=0 → Dx + Ey=0.

But D=-10, E=-5√14/28.

So, tangent at C: -10x - (5√14/28)y=0 → 10x + (5√14/28)y=0.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute it carefully.

Wait, F is zero, so for point C=(0,0), the tangent is:

x*0 + y*0 + (-10)(x + 0)/2 + (-5√14/28)(y + 0)/2 + 0=0.

Simplify:

(-10x)/2 + (-5√14 y)/56=0 → -5x + (-5√14 y)/56=0.

Multiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:

-5x*56 + (-5√14 y)=0 → -280x -5√14 y=0.

Divide both sides by -5:

56x + √14 y=0.

So, the tangent at C is 56x + √14 y=0.

Similarly, for the tangent at B.

Point B is (39/5, 6√14/5). So, let's use the tangent formula.

The tangent at B is x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-10)(x + 39/5)/2 + (-5√14/28)(y + 6√14/5)/2=0.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula:

For a circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0, the tangent at (x₁, y₁) is xx₁ + yy₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F=0.

So, plugging in point B: x₁=39/5, y₁=6√14/5.

So, tangent equation:

x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 + (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2 + 0=0.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (39/5)x.

Second term: (6√14/5)y.

Third term: (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 = (-10/2)x - (10*39)/(5*2) = -5x - (390)/(10) = -5x -39.

Fourth term: (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2 = (-5√14/28)*(y/2 + (6√14)/(5*2)) = (-5√14/28)*(y/2 + 3√14/5).

Let me compute that:

Multiply each term inside the parentheses by (-5√14/28):

First part: (-5√14/28)*(y/2) = (-5√14 y)/56.

Second part: (-5√14/28)*(3√14/5) = (-5√14 *3√14) / (28*5)= (-15 *14)/(140)= (-210)/140= -3/2.

So, the fourth term is (-5√14 y)/56 -3/2.

Now, putting all terms together:

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 - (5√14 y)/56 -3/2 =0.

Let me collect like terms:

x terms: (39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x= (14/5)x.

y terms: (6√14/5)y - (5√14/56)y.

Constants: -39 -3/2= -81/2.

So, equation becomes:

(14/5)x + [ (6√14/5 -5√14/56) y ] -81/2=0.

Let me simplify the coefficient of y:

Find a common denominator for 5 and 56, which is 280.

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280 = (336√14)/280.

-5√14/56 = (-25√14)/280.

So, adding them: (336√14 -25√14)/280 = (311√14)/280.

So, the y term is (311√14/280) y.

So, the equation becomes:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)y -81/2=0.

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed the fourth term, (-5√14/28)*(3√14/5):

(-5√14/28)*(3√14/5) = (-5*3)*(√14 *√14)/(28*5) = (-15)*(14)/(140) = (-210)/140= -3/2. So, that part is correct.

Wait, and the x term: (39/5)x -5x. 5x is 25/5 x, so 39/5 -25/5=14/5. Correct.

The y term: (6√14/5)y - (5√14/56)y.

Let me recalculate:

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280 = (336√14)/280.

5√14/56 = (5√14 *5)/280 = (25√14)/280.

So, 6√14/5 -5√14/56 = (336√14 -25√14)/280 = 311√14/280. Correct.

So, the tangent at B is (14/5)x + (311√14/280)y =81/2.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.

Now, I have the equations of the two tangents: tangent at C is 56x +√14 y =0, and tangent at B is (14/5)x + (311√14/280)y =81/2.

Wait, maybe I can simplify the tangent at B equation.

Let me write it as:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)y =81/2.

Multiply both sides by 280 to eliminate denominators:

14/5 x *280 = 14*56 x = 784x.

311√14/280 y *280=311√14 y.

81/2 *280=81*140=11340.

So, equation becomes:

784x +311√14 y=11340.

Similarly, the tangent at C is 56x +√14 y=0.

Now, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of these two tangents.

So, solving the system:

56x +√14 y =0 ... (1)

784x +311√14 y=11340 ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for y:

√14 y = -56x → y= (-56x)/√14 = (-56/√14) x.

Simplify:

56/√14 = (56√14)/14=4√14.

So, y= -4√14 x.

Now, plug this into equation (2):

784x +311√14*(-4√14 x)=11340.

Compute 311√14*(-4√14 x):

= -4*311*(√14)^2 x = -4*311*14 x= -4*4354 x= -17416 x.

So, equation becomes:

784x -17416x=11340 → (784 -17416)x=11340 → (-16632)x=11340.

Thus, x= 11340 / (-16632).

Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12:

11340 ÷12=945, 16632 ÷12=1386.

So, x= -945/1386.

Simplify further: divide numerator and denominator by 21:

945 ÷21=45, 1386 ÷21=66.

So, x= -45/66.

Simplify again by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:

45 ÷3=15, 66 ÷3=22.

So, x= -15/22.

Thus, x= -15/22.

Now, find y= -4√14 x= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, I need to find the equation of line AD, which connects A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30√14/11).

Let me find the parametric equations or the slope-intercept form.

First, compute the slope:

m=( y_D - y_A )/(x_D - x_A )= (30√14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ).

Compute denominator: -15/22 -10= -15/22 -220/22= (-235)/22.

So, slope m= (30√14/11 ) / ( -235/22 )= (30√14/11 ) * ( -22/235 )= (30√14 * (-22)) / (11*235 )= ( -660√14 )/(2585 ).

Simplify the fraction -660/2585:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5:

660 ÷5=132, 2585 ÷5=517.

So, slope m= (-132√14)/517.

Wait, 132 and 517: 517 ÷11=47, 132 ÷11=12. So, divide numerator and denominator by 11:

132 ÷11=12, 517 ÷11=47.

So, slope m= (-12√14)/47.

So, the slope of AD is -12√14/47.

Now, equation of AD: using point A(10,0):

y -0= m(x -10) → y= (-12√14/47)(x -10).

So, y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Now, we need to find the other intersection point P of AD with the circumcircle ω.

We already know that A is on both AD and ω, so P is the other point.

So, we can solve the system:

1. y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

2. The equation of ω: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Substitute y from equation 1 into equation 2:

x² + [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ]² -10x - (5√14/28)[ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ]=0.

This looks complicated, but let's proceed step by step.

First, compute [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ]².

Let me denote a= (-12√14/47), b=120√14/47.

So, (a x + b)^2= a² x² + 2ab x + b².

Compute a²:

( (-12√14/47 ) )²= (144*14)/(47²)= 2016/2209.

Compute 2ab:

2*(-12√14/47)*(120√14/47)= 2*(-12*120)*(14)/(47²)= 2*(-1440)*14/(2209)= (-40320)/2209.

Compute b²:

(120√14/47 )²= (14400*14)/(47²)= 201600/2209.

So, [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ]²= (2016/2209)x² + (-40320/2209)x + 201600/2209.

Now, plug into equation 2:

x² + [ (2016/2209)x² + (-40320/2209)x + 201600/2209 ] -10x - (5√14/28)( (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) )=0.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, expand the equation:

x² + (2016/2209)x² - (40320/2209)x + 201600/2209 -10x - (5√14/28)( (-12√14/47 x ) + (120√14/47 ) )=0.

Now, compute the term involving the last parenthesis:

(5√14/28)( (-12√14/47 x ) + (120√14/47 ) )

= (5√14/28)*(-12√14/47 x ) + (5√14/28)*(120√14/47 )

Compute each part:

First part: (5√14/28)(-12√14/47 x )= 5*(-12)*(14)/(28*47) x= (-60*14)/(1316) x= (-840)/1316 x.

Simplify: 840 ÷4=210, 1316 ÷4=329. So, (-210)/329 x.

Second part: (5√14/28)*(120√14/47 )=5*120*(14)/(28*47 )=600*14/(1316)=8400/1316.

Simplify: 8400 ÷4=2100, 1316 ÷4=329. So, 2100/329.

So, the entire term is (-210/329 x ) + (2100/329).

But since it's subtracted in the main equation, it becomes:

- [ (-210/329 x ) + (2100/329) ] = +210/329 x -2100/329.

So, putting it all together:

x² + (2016/2209)x² - (40320/2209)x + 201600/2209 -10x +210/329 x -2100/329=0.

Now, let me collect like terms.

First, x² terms:

1*x² + (2016/2209)x² = (2209/2209 +2016/2209)x²= (4225/2209)x².

Next, x terms:

-40320/2209 x -10x +210/329 x.

Convert all to a common denominator, which is 2209.

Note that 329 is a factor of 2209: 2209 ÷329=6.715... Wait, 329*6=2094, 329*7=2303, which is more than 2209. Hmm, perhaps 329 is a prime?

Wait, 329= 7*47. Because 7*47=329. And 2209=47²=2209. So, 2209=47², 329=7*47.

So, to get common denominator for the x terms:

-40320/2209 x -10x +210/329 x.

Convert each term:

-40320/2209 x remains as is.

-10x = -10*(2209)/2209 x= -22090/2209 x.

210/329 x=210*(47)/2209 x=9870/2209 x.

So, combining:

(-40320 -22090 +9870)/2209 x= (-40320 -22090= -62410 +9870= -52540)/2209 x.

So, x terms: -52540/2209 x.

Constant terms:

201600/2209 -2100/329.

Convert to common denominator 2209:

201600/2209 -2100*(47)/2209=201600/2209 -98700/2209= (201600 -98700)/2209=102900/2209.

So, putting all together:

(4225/2209)x² - (52540/2209)x +102900/2209=0.

Multiply both sides by 2209 to eliminate denominators:

4225x² -52540x +102900=0.

This is a quadratic equation: 4225x² -52540x +102900=0.

Let me try to simplify this equation by dividing by a common factor.

Looking at coefficients: 4225, 52540,102900.

Find GCD of these numbers.

4225 factors: 4225=65²= (5*13)²=25*169=25*13².

52540: 52540 ÷ 5=10508. So, 5*10508. 10508 ÷4=2627. 2627 is a prime? Not sure.

102900: 102900= 100*1029=100*3*343=100*3*7³.

Wait, 4225=25*13², 52540=5*4*2627, 102900=100*3*7³.

No obvious common factors except maybe 5? Let's check.

4225: ends with 25, which is divisible by 5. So, 4225 ÷5= 845.

52540 ÷5=10508.

102900 ÷5=20580.

So, divide equation by 5:

(4225/5)x² - (52540/5)x +102900/5=0 → 845x² -10508x +20580=0.

Check if 845, 10508, 20580 have a common factor.

845=5*13².

10508: 10508 ÷4=2627. 2627 ÷7=375.285... Not integer. So, 10508=4*2627.

20580=2058*10=2*1029*10=2*3*343*10=2*3*7³*10.

So, no common factors. So, proceed with quadratic equation:

845x² -10508x +20580=0.

Let me try to solve this quadratic using the quadratic formula.

x= [10508 ± sqrt(10508² -4*845*20580)]/(2*845).

Compute discriminant D=10508² -4*845*20580.

Compute 10508² first.

10508²: Let me compute 10500²=110,250,000. Then, (10500 +8)^2=10500² + 2*10500*8 +8²=110,250,000 +168,000 +64=110,418,064.

Then, 4*845*20580:

Compute 4*845=3380.

3380*20580: Let me compute 3380*20000=67,600,000 and 3380*580= ?

Compute 3380*500=1,690,000.

3380*80=270,400.

So, 1,690,000 +270,400=1,960,400.

So, total 4*845*20580=67,600,000 +1,960,400=69,560,400.

So, D=110,418,064 -69,560,400=40,857,664.

Now, sqrt(D)=sqrt(40,857,664).

Let me see, 6392²= (6000+392)^2=6000² + 2*6000*392 +392²=36,000,000 +4,704,000 +153,664=40,857,664.

Yes! So, sqrt(D)=6392.

So, x= [10508 ±6392]/(2*845)= [10508 ±6392]/1690.

Compute the two roots:

First root: (10508 +6392)/1690=16900/1690=10.

Second root: (10508 -6392)/1690=4116/1690.

Simplify 4116/1690.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 2058/845.

Check if 2058 and 845 have common factors.

845=5*13².

2058: 2058 ÷2=1029. 1029 ÷3=343. So, 2058=2*3*343=2*3*7³.

845=5*13². So, no common factors.

So, x=10 or x=2058/845.

But x=10 is point A, so the other intersection point P has x=2058/845.

So, x=2058/845.

Now, find y coordinate using equation of AD:

y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Plug x=2058/845:

y= (-12√14/47)*(2058/845) + (120√14)/47.

Compute first term:

(-12√14/47)*(2058/845)= (-12*2058*√14)/(47*845).

Compute numerator:12*2058=24,696.

Denominator:47*845=47*800 +47*45=37,600 +2,115=39,715.

So, first term: -24,696√14 /39,715.

Second term: (120√14)/47= (120√14 *845)/(47*845)= (101,400√14)/39,715.

So, add the two terms:

(-24,696√14 +101,400√14)/39,715= (76,704√14)/39,715.

Simplify 76,704 and 39,715.

Check if they have common factors.

76,704 ÷ 3=25,568. 39,715 ÷3=13,238.333… So, no.

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(76704,39715).

Compute GCD(76704,39715):

76704 ÷39715=1, remainder 76704 -39715=36989.

Now, GCD(39715,36989).

39715 -36989=2726.

GCD(36989,2726).

36989 ÷2726=13*2726=35,438. 36989 -35,438=1,551.

GCD(2726,1551).

2726 ÷1551=1, remainder 1175.

GCD(1551,1175).

1551 -1175=376.

GCD(1175,376).

1175 ÷376=3, remainder 1175-3*376=1175-1128=47.

GCD(376,47).

376 ÷47=8, remainder 0. So, GCD is47.

So, GCD of 76704 and39715 is47.

So, divide numerator and denominator by47:

76704 ÷47=1632.

39715 ÷47=845.

So, y= (1632√14)/845.

Simplify 1632/845.

Check if 1632 and845 have common factors.

845=5*13².

1632 ÷5=326.4, not integer.

1632 ÷13=125.538… Not integer.

So, y=1632√14/845.

Thus, point P is at (2058/845, 1632√14/845).

Now, I need to compute the distance AP.

Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (2058/845,1632√14/845).

Compute the distance between these two points.

AP= sqrt[ (10 -2058/845)^2 + (0 -1632√14/845)^2 ].

First, compute 10 -2058/845.

10=8450/845.

So, 8450/845 -2058/845= (8450-2058)/845=6392/845.

So, the x difference is 6392/845.

The y difference is -1632√14/845.

So, AP= sqrt[ (6392/845)^2 + (1632√14/845)^2 ].

Factor out (1/845)^2:

AP= (1/845) sqrt(6392² + (1632² *14 )).

Compute inside the sqrt:

Compute 6392²: 6392*6392. Hmm, 6000²=36,000,000, 392²=153,664, and cross term 2*6000*392=4,704,000. So, (a+b)^2= a² +2ab +b².

So, 6392²= (6000+392)^2=6000² +2*6000*392 +392²=36,000,000 +4,704,000 +153,664=40,857,664.

Now, compute 1632² *14.

1632²: Let's compute 1600²=2,560,000, 32²=1,024, and cross term 2*1600*32=102,400.

So, 1632²= (1600+32)^2=1600² +2*1600*32 +32²=2,560,000 +102,400 +1,024=2,663,424.

Multiply by 14: 2,663,424 *14= 37,287, 936?

Wait, 2,663,424 *10=26,634,240.

2,663,424 *4=10,653,696.

Add them: 26,634,240 +10,653,696=37,287,936.

So, 1632² *14=37,287,936.

Now, sum 6392² +1632² *14=40,857,664 +37,287,936=78,145,600.

So, AP= (1/845)*sqrt(78,145,600).

Compute sqrt(78,145,600).

Let me see, 8,840²=78,145,600 because 8,800²=77,440,000, and (8,800+40)^2=8,800² +2*8,800*40 +40²=77,440,000 +704,000 +1,600=78,145,600.

Yes, so sqrt(78,145,600)=8,840.

So, AP=8,840 /845.

Simplify 8840/845.

Divide numerator and denominator by5: 8840 ÷5=1768, 845 ÷5=169.

So, AP=1768/169.

Check if 1768 and169 have common factors.

169=13².

1768 ÷13=136, because 13*136=1768.

So, AP=136/13.

Simplify 136/13: 136 ÷13=10.4615, but as a fraction, it's 136/13.

Check if 136 and13 are coprime. 13 is prime, 136 ÷13=10.4615, so no, they are coprime.

Wait, 136=17*8, 13 is prime, so yes, co-prime.

So, AP=136/13.

So, m=136, n=13. m +n=136+13=149.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{149}


Given a triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\). The line \(AD\) intersects \(\omega\) again at point \(P\). We need to find the length of \(AP\) given \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\).

1. **Coordinates of Points**:
   - Place \(C\) at \((0, 0)\) and \(A\) at \((10, 0)\).
   - Determine coordinates of \(B\) using distances:
     - \(B = \left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right)\).

2. **Equation of Circumcircle \(\omega\)**:
   - The equation of the circumcircle is found to be \(x^2 + y^2 - 10x - \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{28}y = 0\).

3. **Equations of Tangents**:
   - Tangent at \(C\): \(56x + \sqrt{14}y = 0\).
   - Tangent at \(B\): \(784x + 311\sqrt{14}y = 11340\).

4. **Intersection Point \(D\)**:
   - Solve the system of tangents to find \(D\):
     - \(D = \left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

5. **Equation of Line \(AD\)**:
   - The slope of \(AD\) is \(-\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47}\).
   - Equation of \(AD\): \(y = -\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47}x + \frac{120\sqrt{14}}{47}\).

6. **Intersection with Circumcircle**:
   - Solve the system of the line \(AD\) and the circumcircle to find point \(P\):
     - \(P = \left(\frac{2058}{845}, \frac{1632\sqrt{14}}{845}\right)\).

7. **Distance \(AP\)**:
   - Calculate the distance between \(A(10, 0)\) and \(P\left(\frac{2058}{845}, \frac{1632\sqrt{14}}{845}\right)\):
     - \(AP = \frac{136}{13}\).

8. **Final Answer**:
   - \(AP\) is \(\frac{136}{13}\), so \(m + n = 136 + 13 = 149\).

\[
\boxed{149}
