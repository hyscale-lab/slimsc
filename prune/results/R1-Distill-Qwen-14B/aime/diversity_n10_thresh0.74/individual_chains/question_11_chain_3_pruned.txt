Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the largest possible real part of this expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First off, z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. That means if I write z as 4e^{iθ}, right? Because |z| = 4, so z can be expressed in polar form as 4 times e to some imaginary angle θ. So, z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). That might come in handy later.

Now, the expression given is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. I need to find the maximum real part of this. Let me denote this expression as E. So, E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since z is in the denominator in the second term, maybe it's a good idea to express 1/z in terms of z's polar form. Because if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, right? Because 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|². Since |z| is 4, |z|² is 16, so 1/z = \overline{z}/4. But since z = 4e^{iθ}, then \overline{z} is 4e^{-iθ}, so 1/z is e^{-iθ}/4. That makes sense.

So, substituting this into E, we have:

E = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (e^{-iθ}/4).

Let me compute each part separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Let me compute (75 + 117i) multiplied by 4. 75*4 is 300, 117*4 is 468. So, that part becomes 300 + 468i. So, the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (e^{-iθ}/4).

Compute (96 + 144i) multiplied by 1/4. 96/4 is 24, 144/4 is 36. So, that part becomes 24 + 36i. So, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now, E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, maybe I can write this in terms of cosθ and sinθ. Because e^{iθ} is cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} is cosθ - i sinθ. So, let me expand both terms.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me compute each part.

First term expansion:

Multiply (300)(cosθ) + (300)(i sinθ) + (468i)(cosθ) + (468i)(i sinθ).

Simplify each term:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ.

Remember that i² = -1, so the last term becomes -468 sinθ.

So, combining like terms:

Real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

So, first term is (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).

Second term expansion:

(24)(cosθ) + (24)(-i sinθ) + (36i)(cosθ) + (36i)(-i sinθ).

Simplify each term:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ.

Again, i² = -1, so the last term becomes +36 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

So, the second term is (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Now, adding the first and second terms together to get E.

E = [ (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) ] + i [ (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) ].

Let me compute the real and imaginary parts separately.

Real part:

300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary part:

300 sinθ + 468 cosθ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ.

Again, combine like terms:

(468 + 36) cosθ + (300 -24) sinθ.

Which is 504 cosθ + 276 sinθ.

So, E = (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(504 cosθ + 276 sinθ).

But we are only interested in the real part of E, so Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of Re(E) as θ varies.

So, Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

This is a function of θ, and we need to find its maximum value.

I remember that the maximum of a function of the form A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). But wait, in this case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is like A cosθ + B sinθ, but B is negative.

So, let me write it as (324) cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So, in the form A cosθ + B sinθ, A is 324, B is -432.

The maximum value of this expression is sqrt(A² + B²). So, the maximum Re(E) is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Compute that.

First, calculate 324 squared and 432 squared.

324^2: Let's see, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and the cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, 324^2 = (300 +24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

432^2: Hmm, 400^2 is 160,000, 32^2 is 1,024, cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So, 432^2 = (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, A² + B² = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So sqrt(291,600). Let me compute that. 540 squared is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 540^2= (500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600. Yes, so sqrt(291,600) is 540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

So, Re(E) is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So, the maximum is
