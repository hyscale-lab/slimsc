Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC² where point C is on segment AB, but it doesn't belong to any other segment from the family F except AB itself. Let me try to break this down.

First, let me understand the setup. We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and point B is somewhere along the y-axis, specifically at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is approximately (0, 0.866). So, the segment AB connects these two points.

Next, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and each Q is on the y-axis. So, for any such segment PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with the distance between P and Q being 1. So, the distance formula gives sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which implies p² + q² = 1. Therefore, all such segments PQ lie on the unit circle in the first quadrant, but since P and Q are on the axes, each PQ is a chord of the unit circle from the x-axis to the y-axis.

So, the family F is essentially all such chords PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. Each such chord is a segment in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that does not lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is a segment in F because OA is 1/2 and OB is sqrt(3)/2, so let me check: the length of AB can be found using the distance formula. From A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2), the distance is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, the family F includes AB and all other possible unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. The problem is saying that only C on AB (other than A and B) doesn't lie on any other segment from F. So, C is a point where if you take any other segment PQ from F, C won't be on it. So, C is only on AB among all the segments in F.

Our goal is to find OC², which is just the squared distance from the origin to point C. Then express that as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, so to find point C, I need to find a point on AB such that it's not on any other segment PQ from F. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F? Because in families of curves, the envelope is the set of points where each point is on exactly one member of the family. So, if AB is a member, then the envelope might touch AB at point C.

Alternatively, maybe C is the intersection point of AB with another segment from F. But wait, the problem says that C is on AB and not on any other segment from F except AB. So, perhaps C is the point where two segments from F intersect on AB. But wait, since AB is already in F, maybe C is a point where another PQ from F crosses AB, but we need C to not be on any other PQ. Hmm, I might be getting confused here.

Let me approach it step by step. First, let's parametrize AB. Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equation of AB can be written as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express AB in terms of a single parameter. Let's say any point C on AB can be represented as (1/2 - s/2, (sqrt(3)/2)s) where s ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, that's similar to the parametric equations above. Actually, perhaps a simpler way is to express AB in terms of a
