Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions like this, it's often helpful to express z in polar form. Since |z| = 4, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That makes sense because the modulus is 4, and the exponential form captures both modulus and argument.

So, let me set z = 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because the reciprocal of e^{iθ} is e^{-iθ}, and the modulus becomes 1/|z| = 1/4.

Now, substituting z into the expression: (75 + 117i)z becomes (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}, and (96 + 144i)/z becomes (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute both parts separately.

First part: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}. Let me calculate 4*(75 + 117i). 4*75 is 300, and 4*117 is 468. So this part becomes 300 + 468i multiplied by e^{iθ}.

Second part: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

So now the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. Remember that the real part of a complex number is just the real component. So, let's compute each part's real component.

First, let me expand the terms:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} = 300e^{iθ} + 468i e^{iθ}.

Similarly, (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ} = 24e^{-iθ} + 36i e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression becomes:

300e^{iθ} + 468i e^{iθ} + 24e^{-iθ} + 36i e^{-iθ}.

Now, I can group the terms with e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}:

= [300e^{iθ} + 24e^{-iθ}] + [468i e^{iθ} + 36i e^{-iθ}].

Now, I need to find the real part of this sum. The real part of a sum is the sum of the real parts, so I can handle each bracket separately.

Let's compute the real part of the first bracket: Re[300e^{iθ} + 24e^{-iθ}].

Similarly, the real part of the second bracket: Re[468i e^{iθ} + 36i e^{-iθ}].

Wait, but before that, perhaps I should express each term in terms of cosine and sine, since e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

Let me do that.

First, let's compute each term:

300e^{iθ} = 300(cosθ + i sinθ).

24e^{-iθ} = 24(cosθ - i sinθ).

So, adding them together:

300e^{iθ} + 24e^{-iθ} = 300cosθ + 300i sinθ + 24cosθ - 24i sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 300cosθ + 24cosθ = 324cosθ.

Imaginary parts: (300i - 24i) sinθ = 276i sinθ.

So, the first bracket's real part is 324cosθ, and the imaginary part is 276 sinθ.

Now, moving on to the second bracket: 468i e^{iθ} + 36i e^{-iθ}.

Let's compute each term:

468i e^{iθ} = 468i (cosθ + i sinθ) = 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ = 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, 36i e^{-iθ} = 36i (cosθ - i sinθ) = 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ = 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Adding these together:

468i cosθ - 468 sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: (-468 sinθ + 36 sinθ) = (-432 sinθ).

Imaginary parts: (468i cosθ + 36i cosθ) = 504i cosθ.

So, the second bracket's real part is -432 sinθ, and the imaginary part is 504 cosθ.

Now, combining both brackets, the entire expression's real part is:

Re[expr] = 324 cosθ + (-432 sinθ).

And the imaginary part is 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ, but since we're only concerned with the real part, we can ignore the imaginary part for now.

So, Re[expr] = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this real part. That is, I need to maximize the function f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, how do I find the maximum of such a function? I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²), and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of this expression is then C.

Wait, right! So, since f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, it's equivalent to C cos(θ + φ), and the maximum value is C.

So, let's compute C.

C = sqrt(A² + B²), where A = 324 and B = -432.

So, C = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324² + 432²).

Hmm, let me compute these squares.

324 squared: 324*324. Let me compute that.

324 * 300 = 97,200

324 * 24 = 7,776

So, 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 432 * 432.

Well, 400^2 = 160,000.

32^2 = 1,024.

And cross term: 2*400*32 = 25,600.

So, 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

Wait, no, that's not right. 432 is 400 + 32, so (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

So, 432² = (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 is 185,600, plus 1,024 is 186,624. Right.

So, 324² = 104,976, 432² = 186,624.

So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Hmm, let's see. 500² = 250,000. 540² = 291,600 because 54² = 2,916, so 540² = (54*10)^2 = 54² * 100 = 2,916 * 100 = 291,600. So, sqrt(291,600) is 540.

So, C = 540. Therefore, the maximum value of f(θ) is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because it's crucial not to make mistakes here.

1. I expressed z as 4e^{iθ} correctly because |z|=4.

2. Then, I correctly substituted into the expression, breaking it down into two parts.

3.
