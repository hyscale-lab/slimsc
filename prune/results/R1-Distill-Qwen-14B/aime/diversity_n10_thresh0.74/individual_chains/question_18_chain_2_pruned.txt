Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, let me visualize a regular dodecagon first. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there are a lot of symmetries and diagonals that can form rectangles. Since the dodecagon is regular, any rectangle formed by its sides or diagonals must align with this symmetry.

So, to find the number of rectangles, I think I should consider how rectangles are formed. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. In a dodecagon, sides and certain diagonals can be parallel. So, perhaps I can count how many pairs of parallel sides and diagonals there are, and then figure out how to combine them to form rectangles.

Let me start by recalling that in a regular n-gon, the number of sides is n, and the number of diagonals is n(n-3)/2. But in this case, I'm more interested in the number of sets of parallel sides and diagonals.

In a regular dodecagon, sides can be of different lengths. Wait, no, all sides are equal, but the diagonals can have different lengths. But for the purpose of forming rectangles, I need two pairs of parallel lines, each pair having the same length. So, perhaps I should look for all possible directions of lines (sides and diagonals) and count how many pairs are parallel in each direction.

Each direction corresponds to a step around the polygon. For a regular dodecagon, a step of k vertices between two vertices gives a diagonal. For example, in a dodecagon, a step of 1 would be a side, step of 2 would be a diagonal, step of 3 would be another diagonal, and so on up to step of 5, since beyond that, it's the same as stepping backwards (since 12 is even, stepping 6 would give a diameter).

Wait, stepping k or stepping 12 - k gives the same line but in opposite directions. So, for each k from 1 to 5, there's a corresponding direction. So, the possible directions are determined by the step sizes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Each step size gives a different direction, except that stepping 6 is the diameter, which is unique.

So, for each step size k (from 1 to 6), we have lines (sides or diagonals) that are parallel in that direction.

But wait, for a step size k, how many lines are there? For each step size k, the number of such lines is 12, because each vertex connects to the vertex k steps away, right? So, for each k, 12 lines. But these lines are grouped into sets of 12/k lines, each set being parallel. Wait, no. Actually, it's more accurate to say that for each k, the lines are in 12 different positions, but some are overlapping in direction.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the dodecagon is regular, each step size k (from 1 to 5, since 6 is the diameter) will have lines in the same direction. So, for each k, the number of lines is 12, but they're grouped into 12/gcd(12,k) parallel lines. Because each line is part of a set of parallel lines. For example, for k=1 (the sides), the 12 sides are all parallel in the same direction? No, wait. No, each side is in a different direction. So, each side is only adjacent to its neighbors, so their direction is different. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, each side is connected to two vertices, but the sides themselves are not all parallel. So, wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. In a regular polygon, sides are all congruent but not necessarily parallel. So, for a dodecagon, each side is in a different direction, spaced 30 degrees apart.

But wait, no, because the sides are connected between adjacent vertices, each side is rotated by 30 degrees from the next. So, all sides are not parallel. So, perhaps my initial thought was wrong. So, in that case, when considering lines from the dodecagon, sides are not parallel, but certain diagonals can be.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. In a regular polygon, two lines are parallel if the number of steps between their respective vertices is the same. So, for a regular dodecagon, if I have two diagonals that step k vertices apart, they are parallel if they step the same number of vertices. So, for example, stepping 1 vertex apart is a side, but all sides are not parallel because each side is adjacent, so each side is a different direction.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, stepping k=1: each side is a step of 1, but the sides are each 30 degrees apart. So, no two sides are parallel. So, only diagonals can be parallel. Similarly, stepping k=2, each diagonal steps over one vertex, and these diagonals are all parallel if they are in the same rotational position. Hmm, no, perhaps not. Wait, maybe stepping k=2 in a dodecagon, starting from each vertex, gives a set of 12 such diagonals, but these are not all parallel. Wait, no, because stepping k=2 from each vertex, but because 12 is a multiple of 2, these diagonals would form a regular hexagon. So, each diagonal from k=2 is part of a hexagon, but each of these diagonals is parallel to the other diagonals in the same hexagon.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of directions (slopes) for each step size k. For each k from 1 to 5, the number of distinct directions is equal to the number of step sizes that produce unique angles. Since 12 is divisible by k for k=1,2,3,4,6, but not for k=5. So, for each k, the number of distinct directions is 12 divided by the greatest common divisor of 12 and k.

Wait, I think that's the case. So, for each step size k, the number of distinct directions is gcd(12, k). Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: For step size k, the number of distinct directions is equal to the number of unique rotational positions, which is 12 divided by the number of symmetries that repeat the direction. Hmm, perhaps more accurately, the number of distinct directions for step size k is equal to the number of rotational symmetries that map the polygon onto itself, which is 12, but the number of unique directions is 12 divided by the greatest common divisor of 12 and k.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that for each step size k, the number of distinct directions is 12 / gcd(12, k). Let's check with some examples.

For k=1: gcd(12,1)=1, so 12/1=12 directions. But that can't be right because stepping 1 gives 12 sides, each in a unique direction, 30 degrees apart. So, yes, 12 directions, each 30 degrees apart.

For k=2: gcd(12,2)=2, so 12/2=6 directions. So, stepping 2, which is connecting every other vertex, would create lines in 6 different directions, each 60 degrees apart.

Similarly, for k=3: gcd(12,3)=3, so 12/3=4 directions. So, stepping 3 would create lines in 4 directions, each 90 degrees apart.

For k=4: gcd(12,4)=4, so 12/4=3 directions.

For k=5: gcd(12,5)=1, so 12 directions. Since 5 and 12 are coprime, so stepping 5 would give 12 different directions, each 30 degrees apart, but actually, stepping 5 is equivalent to stepping -7 (since 5 â‰¡ -7 mod 12), so it's similar to stepping
