Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. We have three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300. There's also this other equation involving their squares and products. I need to find how many such triples exist.

I think the first step is to see if I can simplify the second equation somehow. Let me look at it again: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that this can be factored or maybe expressed in terms of symmetric sums or something.

Wait, let me factor this expression. Let's see, I can factor out a² from the first two terms: a²(b + c). Similarly, I can factor out b² from the next two: b²(a + c). And then c² from the last two: c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of 300. Let's try that.

We know that b + c = 300 - a, because a + b + c = 300. Similarly, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substituting these into the expression:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So that simplifies the second equation to:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. So now I have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

I wonder if I can find a relationship between these two. Maybe express the second equation in terms of the first.

Wait, let's expand the second equation. Let's compute each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly for the other terms:
b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³
c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³

So adding them up:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Combine like terms:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)², which I know is 300² = 90,000. Since (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc), so:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)

So substituting into the equation:

300(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me compute 300*90,000. 300 * 90,000 is 27,000,000. So:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Now, subtract 6,000,000 from both sides:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0

Which simplifies to:

21,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can relate a³ + b³ + c³ to something else. I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of (a + b + c)^3 and other symmetric sums.

The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc

So plugging that into the equation:

21,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - [(300)^3 - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 0

Compute 300^3: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000. So,

21,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 0

Let me distribute the negative sign:

21,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) -27,000,000 + 900(ab + ac + bc) -3abc = 0

Combine like terms:

(21,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600 + 900)(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 0

Which simplifies to:

-6,000,000 + 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc =
