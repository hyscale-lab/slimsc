Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with tokens. The setup is that there's a stack of n tokens, and they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make it possible for Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, if I can figure out for which values of n Bob can force a win, that means those n are losing positions for Alice, because Bob is the second player. Wait, no, actually, in this problem, Bob is the second player. So, if n is a losing position for Alice (the first player), then Bob can win. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where the starting position is losing for the first player (Alice), which would make Bob the winner.

Right. So, I should model this as a series of positions, and for each n, determine if it's a winning or losing position. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when n=0, which means there are no tokens left. But wait, in this game, taking the last token wins, so if it's your turn and there are no tokens left, you lose because you can't make a move. So, n=0 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is.

Wait, but the game starts with n tokens, so for n=0, the game is already over. Let me think again. If a player is faced with n=0 tokens on their turn, they can't move and thus lose. So, n=0 is a losing position.

Now, for n=1: the player can take 1 token and win, so n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Or, can the player take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 is
