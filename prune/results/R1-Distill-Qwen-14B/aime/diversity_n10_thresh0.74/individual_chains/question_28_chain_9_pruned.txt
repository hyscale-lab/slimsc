Alright, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each of the faces. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n / p, and then I have to find m + n + p. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces. This distance is called the inradius. To find it, I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and its surface area, or more specifically, the total area of all the faces. The formula I recall is that the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume V divided by the total surface area S. So, r = 3V / S. That makes sense because in 3D, the inradius relates the volume to the surface area, just like in 2D where the inradius of a triangle is area divided by semiperimeter.

But wait, is the formula 3V / S or just V / S? Let me think. In 2D, for a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter, which is (1/2) * perimeter. So, in 3D, it's probably 3 times volume divided by the total surface area. Yeah, I think that's right because volume is like the 3D equivalent of area, and surface area is like the perimeter in 2D. So, yeah, r = 3V / S.

So, my plan is to find the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD and the total surface area S, then compute r = 3V / S.

Now, to find the volume, I need coordinates of the vertices. But the tetrahedron is defined by its edge lengths, so maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices to make the calculations easier.

Looking at the edge lengths: AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. Hmm, that seems symmetric. It looks like opposite edges are equal. So, this is called an isosceles tetrahedron, where all opposite edges are equal. I think such tetrahedrons have some nice properties, maybe they are duals or something?

Wait, in an isosceles tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, which could imply that the tetrahedron is symmetric in a certain way. I remember that in such tetrahedrons, the inradius and circumradius can be related in a particular way, but I'm not sure exactly how.

But maybe I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system in such a way that the centroid is at the origin, and the vertices have coordinates that are symmetric. Let me try that.

Let me denote the coordinates as follows: Let A = (a, b, c), B = (-a, -b, c), C = (-a, b, -c), D = (a, -b, -c). This setup might give me the needed symmetry. Let me check the distances.

Compute AB: The distance between A and B would be sqrt[(a - (-a))² + (b - (-b))² + (c - c)²] = sqrt[(2a)² + (2b)² + 0] = sqrt(4a² +4b²) = 2√(a² + b²). We are given AB = √41, so 2√(a² + b²) = √41. Squaring both sides, 4(a² + b²) = 41, so a² + b² = 41/4.

Similarly, let's compute AC: A is (a, b, c), C is (-a, b, -c). So the distance AC is sqrt[(a - (-a))² + (b - b)² + (c - (-c))²] = sqrt[(2a)² + 0 + (2c)²] = sqrt(4a² +4c²) = 2√(a² + c²). Given AC = √80, so 2√(a² + c²) = √80. Squaring, 4(a² + c²) =80, so a² + c²=20.

Similarly, let's compute AD: A is (a, b, c), D is (a, -b, -c). Distance AD is sqrt[(a - a)^2 + (b - (-b))^2 + (c - (-c))^2] = sqrt[0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^
