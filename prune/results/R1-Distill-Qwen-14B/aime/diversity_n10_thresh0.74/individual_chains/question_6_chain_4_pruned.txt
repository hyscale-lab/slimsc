Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Both functions involve these f and g functions, which are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I think I should understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. Both are absolute value functions, so they're V-shaped, but with some transformations. Let's start with f(x). f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So, the inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so that would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, that complicates things. Maybe I should graph it step by step.

For f(x):
- Start with |x|. So, it's a V-shape with vertex at (0,0).
- Then |x| - 1/2 shifts the graph down by 1/2. So, the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, any negative part will flip up.
- So, where |x| - 1/2 is negative, which is when |x| < 1/2, that part will become positive after the outer absolute value.

So, let me figure out the critical points. The expression inside the outer absolute value is |x| - 1/2. So, when |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = -|x| + 1/2.

So, f(x) is a V-shape that is W-shaped? Wait, no. Wait, let's plot it.

For x between -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) = -|x| + 1/2. So, it's an upside-down V with vertex at (0, 1/2), going down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). Then, for |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which are two lines increasing with slope 1 starting from (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So, overall, f(x) looks like a W, but actually, it's a V with a flat bottom? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V shape opening upwards, but starting at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So, the graph of f(x) is a combination of two lines: for |x| < 1/2, it's a downward V from (0,1/2) to (1/2,0) and (-1/2,0). Then, beyond |x|=1/2, it continues as upward Vs. So, yes, the overall shape is a W? Hmm, not quite. Wait, maybe it's like a V with a flat bottom.

Wait, maybe it's easier to see the critical points. The function f(x) is symmetric about the y-axis because all the operations are even functions. So, let me consider x >=0 and mirror it to x<0.

For x >=0:

f(x)=||x| - 1/2| = |
