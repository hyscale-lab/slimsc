Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that there's a rotation which turns all the blue vertices to where the red ones were originally. Hmm, that's a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.

First, the octagon has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently, so the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's our denominator for the probability. The numerator is the number of colorings where such a rotation exists.

Now, I need to figure out how many colorings satisfy the condition that after some rotation, all blue vertices become red and vice versa. So, if I think about it, this means that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Another way to say that is, the blue vertices must be a "shift" of the red ones by some number of positions.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so rotations are cyclic. So, the key here is that the coloring must be symmetric in a certain way. Specifically, the blue vertices should form a rotated version of the red vertices. So, for a coloring to satisfy the condition, the blue vertices must be a rotationally shifted version of the red ones.

But how do we count such colorings? Maybe it's easier to think in terms of group theory, considering the rotation group of the octagon, which is the cyclic group of order 8. Each rotation corresponds to a group element, and we're looking for colorings that are fixed by some group element.

Wait, that might be too abstract. Let me think differently. Suppose a rotation by k positions (where k is from 0 to 7) maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. So, for some k, every blue vertex at position i must become a red vertex at position i + k (mod 8). And conversely, every red vertex at position i must have been a blue vertex at position i - k (mod 8).

So, for such a coloring to exist, the set of blue vertices must be a shift of the red vertices. That implies that the coloring is periodic with some period d, where d divides 8. Wait, but 8 is 2^3, so the possible periods are 1, 2, 4, 8. Hmm, but does that help?

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the orbit of each vertex under rotation. If a rotation by k positions maps the set of blue vertices to red, then the coloring must be such that the blue vertices are exactly the image of the red vertices under rotation by k. Therefore, the coloring is determined by the red set and the rotation k.

But perhaps another approach: for a given rotation k, the number of colorings fixed by that rotation is equal to the number of colorings where each orbit under rotation by k is monochromatic. Wait, but that might not directly apply here since we're not fixing a coloring, but looking for colorings that can be transformed into their complement by some rotation.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider the orbits of the rotation group. For each rotation k, the cycles it creates are the orbits of the vertices. For example, if k is 1, the rotation by one position creates 8 cycles of length 1, since each vertex is in its own cycle (but that's only if k and 8 are coprime, which they aren't here). Wait no, when k and 8 have a gcd, the number of cycles is equal to the gcd. For example, if k=2, the gcd(2,8)=2, so the cycle decomposition has 2 cycles, each of length 4.

Wait, perhaps for each divisor d of 8, we can consider the number of colorings that are periodic with period d. But I'm not sure if that's exactly the same as what we're looking for.

Wait, maybe the problem is similar to counting the number of colorings where the coloring is symmetric under some rotation, but in this case, it's not just being symmetric, but being such that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Alternatively, another approach: the condition is that there exists a rotation such that applying it to the blue set gives the red set. That implies that the blue set is a translate of the red set. So, the blue set is a shifted version of the red set. So, for such a coloring, the red and blue sets are translates of each other, meaning that the coloring is periodic with a certain period.

Wait, but the entire octagon is colored, so if the red and blue sets are translates, that implies that the coloring is uniform in some rotational period. So, for example, if the coloring is such that every other vertex is red and blue alternately, then a rotation by two positions would map reds to blues and vice versa.

Wait, but let's take an example. Suppose the coloring is all red. Then, any rotation would leave it unchanged, but red and blue sets are not swapped. So that's not a valid case. Similarly, all blue wouldn't work either. So, perhaps the colorings we're looking for are those where the blue set is a rotation of the red set, but not necessarily the same as the red set.

Wait, think of it this way: Let R be the set of red vertices and B be the set of blue vertices. Then, there exists a rotation σ such that σ(B) = R. Since σ is an invertible rotation, we can write B = σ^{-1}(R). So, the blue set is a shifted version of the red set by σ^{-1}. But since rotations are cyclic, we can just think of it as a shift by some k positions.

So, for each shift k, the number of colorings where B is exactly R shifted by k is equal to the number of R subsets such that R and R shifted by k are complements. Wait, because B is the complement of R, so for B = σ(R), which implies that R shifted by k is the complement of R. So, R shifted by k must equal B, which is the complement of R.

So, R shifted by k must equal the complement of R. So, R is a subset where shifting it by k gives its complement. So, for each k, we can find the number of such subsets R.

But since the octagon is regular, the number of such subsets R for each k would be the same, except when k=0, which would require R to be its own complement, which is only possible if R is exactly half the octagon. But since 8 is even, R can be size 4.

Wait, so for each rotation k, we can find the number of subsets R where shifting R by k gives the complement of R. Then, since different k's might lead to the same R, we need to be careful not to overcount.

Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate for each possible rotation k, the number of subsets R such that R shifted by k is equal to R's complement. Then, sum over all k, but divide by the number of rotations that lead to the same R.

Wait, maybe using Burnside's lemma or something similar. Hmm. But perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let's note that for a given shift k, the number of such R is equal to the number of subsets R with size 4 such that R shifted by k is R's complement. Wait, because if R shifted by k is R's complement, then R shifted by 2k would be R again, implying that shifting by 2k brings R back to itself. So, the shift by 2k is an automorphism of R.

Hmm, but maybe it's better to consider the orbits of the rotation group. For each divisor d of 8, the number of orbits is d, each of length 8/d. But perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: Let's fix a shift k, and then find the number of subsets R such that R shifted by k is equal to R's complement. Let me note that if we shift R by k, we get R's complement, so shifting again by k would shift R's complement by k, which should give back R. So, R shifted by 2k is R. Therefore, R must be invariant under shifting by 2k.

Wait, but 2k is a shift, so R must be periodic with period equal to the order of 2k in the additive group modulo 8. Wait, the order of 2k is 8/gcd(2k,8). Let's compute for each k:

First, note that k can be from 0 to 7.

Case 1: k=0. Then shifting by 0 has order 1, so R must be equal to R shifted by 0, which is trivial. Then, R shifted by 0 is R's complement implies R = R's complement. So, R must be a set where R = complement(R), which implies that R is exactly half the octagon. Since the octagon has 8 vertices, R must be size 4. So, the number of such R is C(8,4)=70. But wait, when k=0, we have R shifted by 0 (which is R) equal to R's complement. So, R must equal its own complement, which requires that R has exactly 4 elements. So, number of R is 70.

Case 2: k=1. Then, shifting R by 1 gives R's complement. Then, shifting R by 2 gives R shifted by 1 shifted by 1, which is R's complement shifted by 1, which is the complement of R shifted by 1, which is R. So, shifting by 2 gives back R. So, R is periodic with period 2. So, R must consist of every other vertex. But in an octagon, shifting by 1 and then by 1 again is shifting by 2, which brings R back to itself.

But wait, R must be such that shifting by 1 gives R's complement, and shifting by 2 gives R again. So, R is a set where shifting by 1 gives its complement, and shifting by 2 gives R.

So, let's see: if R is such that R shifted by 1 is R's complement, then R is a set where every element is offset by 1 from an element not in R. So, in other words, R is a set where for each i, i is in R if and only if i+1 is not in R. So, R must be a set of non-consecutive elements with exactly one space between them.

But in an octagon, is this possible? Let me imagine an octagon with vertices labeled 0 to 7.

If R is {0,2,4,6}, then shifting by 1 gives {1,3,5,7}, which is R's complement. So that works. Similarly, R could be {1,3,5,7}, same idea. But wait, are there other possibilities?

Wait, if R is {0,2,4,6}, shifting by 1 gives {1,3,5,7}, which is the complement. Similarly, shifting by 2 gives {2,4,6,0} which is R again. So, that's a valid R. Similarly, R could be {1,3,5,7}, which when shifted by 1 gives {2,4,6,0}, which is the complement. So, that's another R.

But are there other Rs that satisfy this condition? For example, R = {0,1,4,5}: shifting by 1 gives {1,2,5,6}. Is that the complement of R? R's complement is {2,3,6,7}. So, no, that's not equal. So, {0,1,4,5} doesn't satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, maybe R must form a system of representatives for some orbits. Since shifting by 1, the entire set is partitioned into orbits of size 8/gcd(1,8)=8. So, each orbit is the entire set, so R must be a subset that is shifted to its complement. But in this case, the only possible R is the one where R and its complement are shifts of each other by 1.

Wait, but in the case of k=1, shifting R by 1 gives its complement, so R must be such that R and R+1 (mod 8) are complements. So, for each element in R, the next element is not in R, and vice versa. So, R must consist of every other vertex. But in the octagon, that's only two possibilities: R = {0,2,4,6} or R = {1,3,5,7}. So, two possible Rs.

Thus, for k=1, the number of R is 2.

Wait, but wait, because shifting by 1, for R to satisfy R+1 = ~R, then R must be a set where each element is followed by a non-element. So, in a circular fashion, since it's an octagon, R must alternate. So, R can only be the even or the odd positions. So, indeed, only two possibilities.

Similarly, for k=2, what happens? Let's see: shifting R by 2 must give R's complement. So, R shifted by 2 = ~R. So, shifting R by 4 would give R shifted by 2 shifted by 2 = (~R) shifted by 2 = ~ (R shifted by 2) = ~ (~R) = R. So, shifting by 4 gives R back. So, R is periodic with period 4.

So, let's think about R being periodic with period 4. So, R is a union of two cycles, each of length 4. Wait, no, because shifting by 2 gives the complement. So, if R is {0,1,2,3}, then shifting by 2 gives {2,3,4,5}, which is not the complement. So, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps R is such that every other two elements are selected. For example, R = {0,1,4,5}, but that seems arbitrary.

Wait, if R is periodic with period 4, then R can be represented as two blocks of four, each block being a shift of the other. But in this case, shifting by 2 must invert R. Hmm, maybe it's better to consider specific examples.

Suppose R is {0,2,4,6}, as before. Then shifting R by 2 gives {2,4,6,0}, which is R itself, not the complement. So that's not satisfying the condition. Alternatively, if R is {0,1,4,5}, shifting by 2 gives {2,3,6,7}, which is the complement of R. So, R shifted by 2 is equal to ~R.

So, R = {0,1,4,5}: shifting by 2 gives {2,3,6,7}, which is indeed the complement. Similarly, R could be {1,2,5,6}, since shifting by 2 would give {3,4,7,0}, which is the complement.

Wait, how many such Rs are there? Let's see, the condition is that shifting R by 2 gives its complement. So, in terms of the octagon, R must be such that every pair of opposite vertices is in R or not in R. Wait, because shifting by 4 would bring each vertex to its opposite.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. If R shifted by 2 is the complement, then R and R+2 are complements.

So, each element in R must be such that the element two positions away is not in R. So, for each i, if i is in R, then i+2 is not in R, and vice versa.

So, in the octagon, this would create pairs: 0 and 2, 1 and 3, 4 and 6, 5 and 7. Each pair must have exactly one element in R.

Wait, since R has 4 elements, we can choose one from each pair. So, for each pair, 2 choices, and there are 4 pairs, so 2^4=16 possibilities. But wait, that can't be right because the total number of colorings is only 256. Wait, no, for each k=2, the number of R is 16? But that seems high.

Wait, let's think again. If R is such that for each i, i and i+2 are not both in R, then R must consist of exactly one from each of the four pairs (0,2), (1,3), (4,6), (5,7). So, for each pair, choose one element. So, 2 choices per pair, 4 pairs, so 2^4=16 possible R subsets.

But wait, each such R would have size 4, since we're choosing one from each pair. So, 16 possible Rs. But earlier, I thought of R = {0,1,4,5}, which is one such subset. So, there are 16 Rs for k=2.

But wait, in that case, shifting R by 2 gives the complement. So, does that mean for each k, the number of Rs is 2^{number of cycles}?

Wait, perhaps for each shift k, the number of Rs is 2^{d}, where d is the number of cycles in the cycle decomposition of the shift.

Because when you shift by k, the permutation decomposes into cycles, and for each cycle, you can choose whether to include certain elements.

Wait, but in this problem, we have the condition that shifting R by k gives the complement of R. So, for each cycle in the permutation induced by shifting by k, the elements in R must be arranged such that exactly half are in R and half are not, but since the cycles can have even or odd lengths.

Wait, actually, for the condition R shifted by k = ~R, each cycle must have an even number of elements, because otherwise, you can't split the cycle into R and ~R such that shifting by k maps R to ~R.

So, if the shift by k decomposes the octagon into cycles of even length, then it's possible to have such R subsets.

So, let's see, for shift k, the number of cycles is gcd(k,8). The length of each cycle is 8/gcd(k,8). So, if 8/gcd(k,8) is even, then each cycle has even length, which is necessary for the condition R shifted by k = ~R.

So, for which k is 8/gcd(k,8) even?

Well, 8 is 2^3. So, 8/gcd(k,8) is even if and only if gcd(k,8) is not 8. Because if gcd(k,8) is 8, then 8/8=1, which is odd. So, for k where gcd(k,8) is 1,2,4, then 8/gcd is 8,4,2 respectively, all even. So, only when gcd(k,8)=8 (i.e., k=0) do we get an odd cycle length.

So, for k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7, we have:

gcd(0,8)=8. So, cycle length 1, which is odd. So, for k=0, the condition R shifted by 0 = ~R requires that R is equal to its complement, which only happens if R has size 4. So, number of Rs is C(8,4)=70.

For k=1: gcd(1,8)=1. So, cycle length 8, which is even. So, shifting by 1 decomposes the octagon into a single cycle of length 8. So, to have R shifted by 1 = ~R, each element must alternate between R and ~R. So, the only possible Rs are those where R consists of every other vertex. As before, there are two such Rs: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}.

So, for k=1, number of Rs is 2.

For k=2: gcd(2,8)=2. So, number of cycles is 2, each of length 4. So, for each cycle, we can choose R to include two elements from each cycle. Wait, no, because R shifted by 2 must equal ~R. So, for each cycle, the elements must alternate between R and ~R. So, each cycle of length 4 must be colored alternately. But since 4 is even, each cycle can be colored in two ways: starting with R or starting with ~R.

So, for each cycle, 2 choices, and there are two cycles, so total number of Rs is 2^2=4.

Wait, but earlier I thought of 16 Rs, but that was under a different condition. Maybe I was mistaken.

Wait, let's reevaluate. For k=2, the octagon is split into two cycles: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}. Each cycle is of length 4. For R shifted by 2 to equal ~R, each cycle must have exactly two elements in R, and the shift by 2 must map R to ~R.

So, in each cycle, the elements must alternate between R and ~R. So, for each cycle, the number of ways to choose R is 2: either the first element is in R, then the third is not, but since it's a cycle, this would require the pattern R, ~R, R, ~R, etc. But wait, for a cycle of length 4, how many such subsets R exist?

In a cycle of length 4, shifting by 2 must map R to ~R. So, each element and its shift must be opposite. So, for a cycle {0,2,4,6}, we have 0 paired with 2, and 4 paired with 6 (since shifting by 2). Wait, no, in a cycle, shifting by 2 would pair 0 with 2, 2 with 4, 4 with 6, 6 with 0. Hmm, actually, the pairing isn't direct.

Wait, perhaps in each cycle, the condition is that R is a set where each element is paired with its complement in the cycle. So, for cycle {0,2,4,6}, we can choose R as {0,4} or {2,6}, or {0,2,4,6}, but wait, no.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For a single cycle, to satisfy shifting by k (here, k=2) giving the complement, the subset R must be such that for each element i in R, i + k is not in R, and vice versa. So, for each position i, if i is in R, then i + 2 is not in R.

In the cycle {0,2,4,6}, this would mean that 0 and 2 cannot both be in R. Similarly, 2 and 4 cannot both be in R, and so on.

Wait, but in a cycle of length 4, if we cannot have two consecutive elements (with step 2), then the possible subsets R must have no two elements at distance 2 apart. So, for a cycle of 4, the maximum independent set with no two adjacent (in the cycle) is 2 elements. So, how many such subsets are there?

In a 4-cycle, the number of independent sets of size 2 is 2: {0,2} and {1,3}, but wait, in the 4-cycle labeled 0,2,4,6, perhaps it's {0,4} and {2,6}. So, each cycle contributes 2 possibilities.

Since we have two cycles for k=2, each contributing 2 possibilities, the total number of Rs is 2 * 2 = 4.

So, for k=2, number of Rs is 4.

Similarly, for k=3: gcd(3,8)=1. So, cycle length is 8, which is even, so we can have R such that shifting by 3 gives the complement. Similar to k=1, which also had cycle length 8. So, similar to k=1, the number of Rs is 2.

Wait, because shifting by 3 is a single cycle of length 8, so R must consist of every third vertex, but that's not possible because 8 and 3 are coprime. Wait, no, actually, the condition is that R shifted by 3 is equal to ~R. So, similar to k=1, R must be a set where each element is separated by 3 positions. Wait, but 8 is even, and 3 is odd, so shifting by 3 is equivalent to shifting by -5, which might not change the outcome.

Wait, let's take an example. Let R = {0,1,2,3}. Shifting by 3 gives {3,4,5,6}. Is that the complement of R? R's complement is {4,5,6,7}, so no. So, R must be such that shifting by 3 gives the complement.

Wait, perhaps R must be the set where each element is 3 apart from another. For example, R = {0,3,4,7}. Let's check: shifting R by 3 gives {3,6,7,2}. The complement of R is {1,2,5,6}. So, {3,6,7,2} is not equal to {1,2,5,6}. So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe R = {0,2,4,6}, shifting by 3 gives {3,5,7,1}, which is the complement. So, yes, that works. Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7}, shifting by 3 gives {4,6,0,2}, which is the complement. So, two possible Rs for k=3.

So, similar to k=1, for k=3, the number of Rs is 2.

For k=4: gcd(4,8)=4. So, number of cycles is 4, each of length 2. So, each cycle is {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}.

So, shifting R by 4 must give ~R. So, for each cycle, shifting by 4 swaps the two elements. So, for each cycle, if one element is in R, the other must be in ~R.

Therefore, for each cycle, we have two choices: include the first element and exclude the second, or include the second and exclude the first. So, for each of the 4 cycles, 2 choices. So, total number of Rs is 2^4=16.

Wait, but wait, does this satisfy the condition that shifting R by 4 gives ~R? Let's check. Suppose R is {0,1,2,3}, then shifting by 4 gives {4,5,6,7}, which is the complement. So, yes, that works. But in this case, R = {0,1,2,3} is a subset where for each cycle {0,4}, {1,5}, etc., exactly one is chosen. So, 16 possibilities.

But wait, each cycle has two elements, and for R shifted by 4 to be the complement, each element and its complement must be in opposite sets. So, yes, that makes sense.

So, for k=4, number of Rs is 16.

For k=5: gcd(5,8)=1. So, cycle length 8, which is even. So, similar to k=1 and k=3, the number of Rs is 2.

Wait, let's verify. Let R = {0,2,4,6}, shifting by 5 gives {5,7,1,3}, which is the complement. So, yes, that works. Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7} shifted by 5 gives {6,0,2,4}, which is the complement. So, two Rs.

For k=6: gcd(6,8)=2. So, number of cycles is 2, each of length 4. So, similar to k=2, number of Rs is 4.

Wait, let's see. For k=6, shifting R by 6 is equivalent to shifting by -2. So, similar to k=2, the number of Rs is 4.

For k=7: gcd(7,8)=1. So, cycle length 8, even. So, similar to k=1,3,5, number of Rs is 2.

So, summarizing:

k | gcd(k,8) | number of Rs
---|---------|------------
0 | 8       | 70
1 | 1       | 2
2 | 2       | 4
3 | 1       | 2
4 | 4       | 16
5 | 1       | 2
6 | 2       | 4
7 | 1       | 2

Now, but wait, the problem is that for each k, these Rs might overlap. That is, a single R might satisfy the condition for multiple ks. For example, R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies k=1,3,5,7 because shifting by any of those k's gives the complement. Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7} also satisfies k=1,3,5,7.

Similarly, the Rs for k=2 and k=6 might overlap.

So, if we simply sum all the Rs for each k, we might be overcounting.

So, to find the total number of valid Rs, we need to count each R only once, even if it satisfies the condition for multiple ks.

So, how to proceed?

Perhaps, instead of counting for each k, it's better to consider the group structure and use Burnside's lemma. Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points.

But in this case, we're not looking for orbits, but for colorings that are fixed by some group element in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of valid Rs is equal to the union over all k of the Rs for each k, considering overlaps.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: For a subset R, there exists a k such that R shifted by k is equal to ~R. So, R is a subset such that it is a translate of its complement.

So, the number of such Rs is equal to the number of subsets R such that R is a translate of its complement.

In additive combinatorics, such sets are called "translational complement sets." Maybe there's a known count for such subsets in cyclic groups.

But perhaps I can compute it manually.

Let's think about the possible k for which R can be shifted to its complement.

We know that for R to be a translate of its complement, R must satisfy R + k = ~R, which implies R + 2k = R.

So, R must be periodic with period 2k. So, the period of R must divide 2k, but since we're in Z/8Z, the possible periods are divisors of 8.

Wait, but 2k mod 8 must be a period of R. So, 2k must be congruent to 0 mod d, where d is a period of R.

But this is getting a bit abstract. Let's instead think about possible sizes of R.

Since R is a translate of its complement, the size of R must be equal to the size of its complement, which implies that |R| = 4. So, R must be a subset of size 4.

Wait, but wait: the complement of R is 8 - |R|. So, if R is a translate of its complement, then |R| = 8 - |R|, which implies |R|=4.

So, R must be a subset of size 4.

So, all Rs we are considering have size 4. So, now we can restrict our attention to 4-element subsets of the octagon's vertices.

So, total number of Rs is C(8,4)=70.

Now, among these 70 subsets, how many are translates of their complements?

We need to count the number of 4-element subsets R such that there exists a k where R shifted by k equals ~R.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of 4-element subsets R of Z/8Z such that R + k = ~R for some k.

So, how many such subsets R are there?

Well, let's consider the possible k and how they affect R.

As before, for each k, the number of R such that R + k = ~R is equal to the number of R for that k. But as we saw earlier, each R can be counted multiple times for different k.

So, perhaps the total number is equal to the sum over k of the number of R for each k, divided by the number of k's that map R to its complement.

But this seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that each such R is counted once for each k that satisfies R + k = ~R.

So, the total count is equal to the sum over all R of the number of k such that R +k = ~R.

But since each R that satisfies the condition for some k is counted once, but we need to find the total number of distinct R.

Wait, this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that for each R, the number of k such that R +k = ~R is equal to the number of solutions k to R +k = ~R.

Which is the same as k = ~R - R.

Since in Z/8Z, the number of solutions k is equal to the size of the difference set ~R - R.

But ~R is the complement of R, which is also a 4-element set.

So, the difference set ~R - R is the set of all k such that k = r' - r for some r' in ~R and r in R.

So, the number of such k is equal to the size of this difference set.

But for each R, the number of k's such that R +k = ~R is equal to the number of k's in the difference set ~R - R.

So, if |~R - R| = t, then R is counted t times in the total sum over k of the number of R for each k.

So, the total number of ordered pairs (R,k) where R +k = ~R is equal to the sum over R of |~R - R|.

But I don't know how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the total number of (R,k) pairs where R +k = ~R, and then find the number of distinct R.

But I don't know.

Wait, perhaps for each R, the number of k such that R +k = ~R is equal to the number of solutions to k = ~R - R.

But in Z/8Z, this is the same as the number of k in the sumset ~R + (-R).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each such R has exactly one k that satisfies R +k = ~R.

Wait, no. For example, take R = {0,2,4,6}. Then, shifting by k=1: R +1 = {1,3,5,7} = ~R. Similarly, shifting by k=3: R +3 = {3,5,7,1} = ~R. Similarly, shifting by k=5 and k=7 also gives ~R. So, R is counted 4 times in the total sum.

Similarly, R = {0,1,4,5}: Let's see, shifting by k=2 gives {2,3,6,7} = ~R. Shifting by k=6 gives {6,7,2,3} = ~R. So, R is counted twice.

Wait, so some Rs are counted multiple times depending on how many ks satisfy the condition.

So, perhaps the total number of (R,k) pairs is equal to the sum over k of the number of Rs for that k, which we computed as 70 (for k=0) + 2+4+2+16+2+4+2 = 70 + (2+4+2+16+2+4+2) = 70 + 32 = 102.

Wait, no, let me recheck:

Earlier, for each k:

k=0: 70 Rs

k=1: 2

k=2:4

k=3:2

k=4:16

k=5:2

k=6:4

k=7:2

So, total (R,k) pairs: 70 + 2 +4 +2 +16 +2 +4 +2 = let's compute:

70 + 2=72

72+4=76

76+2=78

78+16=94

94+2=96

96+4=100

100+2=102.

So, 102 (R,k) pairs.

But each R can be counted multiple times, depending on how many k's satisfy R +k = ~R.

We saw that R = {0,2,4,6} is counted 4 times (k=1,3,5,7).

Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7} is also counted 4 times.

Similarly, R = {0,1,4,5} is counted twice (k=2 and k=6).

Similarly, other Rs for k=2,4,6 may be counted multiple times.

So, to find the total number of distinct Rs, we need to know how many Rs are counted multiple times.

So, let's denote:

- Let A be the set of Rs counted 4 times (the two alternating Rs).
- Let B be the set of Rs counted twice (the Rs from k=2 and k=6).
- Let C be the set of Rs counted once (the Rs from k=4, which are 16, but wait, no, for k=4, each R is counted once because shifting by 4 gives the complement, but is there another k that would also satisfy R +k = ~R for those Rs? Probably not, because for those Rs, R has period 2, so shifting by 4 is the same as shifting by 0 in terms of period, but maybe not. Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, for k=4, the Rs are those where each pair {i, i+4} has exactly one element in R. So, for R in k=4, shifting by 4 gives the complement.

But does shifting by another k give the complement? Let's take R = {0,1,4,5}. Shifting by k=2 gives {2,3,6,7}, which is the complement. So, R is in both k=2 and k=4.

Wait, so R is counted in both k=2 and k=4. So, R is in both sets, hence counted twice.

But earlier, for k=4, we had 16 Rs, each counted once for k=4, but some of them may also be counted for other ks.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to find all unique Rs.

Alternative approach: each R must be a translate of its complement. So, R is a subset such that R = ~R +k for some k.

So, R is a subset where R is a shifted version of its complement.

In additive combinatorics, such sets are called "translational self-complementary" sets.

I did a quick search in my mind, and I recall that in cyclic groups of order 2^n, the number of such subsets is equal to 2^{n}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe in Z/8Z, the number of such Rs is equal to the number of solutions to R +k = ~R.

But I don't know the exact count.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that each such R is a difference of two shifts.

Wait, perhaps another way: since the group is abelian, the number of pairs (R,k) where R +k = ~R is equal to the number of pairs where k = ~R - R.

So, the total number of such pairs is equal to the number of ordered pairs (R,k) where k is in ~R - R.

Since each R has size 4, and ~R also has size 4, the difference set ~R - R will have certain properties.

But in Z/8Z, the difference set of two 4-element subsets can vary.

But perhaps the total number of such pairs is equal to 8 * number of such Rs, because for each R, the number of k is equal to the size of the difference set.

But I don't know.

Wait, but earlier, we computed that the total number of (R,k) pairs is 102. So, if we can find the average number of k per R, we can find the number of Rs.

Wait, 102 (R,k) pairs, and each R is counted t times, where t is the number of k such that R +k = ~R. So, the total number of Rs is 102 / t_avg, where t_avg is the average number of k per R.

But without knowing t_avg, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that for each k, the number of Rs is as computed earlier: 70,2,4,2,16,2,4,2. So, summing these gives 102.

But these include overlaps where the same R is counted for multiple k.

Wait, but perhaps the unique Rs are those that are counted multiple times. So, the total unique Rs is less than or equal to 70.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find all such Rs and count them.

Let me try to enumerate.

Case 1: R is such that R = ~R shifted by 1,3,5,7.

These are the two alternating sets: R1 = {0,2,4,6}, R2 = {1,3,5,7}.

Each of these Rs satisfies R +k = ~R for k=1,3,5,7. So, each is counted 4 times in the total (R,k) pairs. So, total Rs in this case: 2.

Case 2: R is such that R shifted by 2 gives ~R. These are the Rs we found for k=2 and k=6.

Each R in k=2 is counted for k=2 and k=6, since shifting by 2 twice gives shifting by 4, which for these Rs (periodic with period 4), shifting by 4 is equivalent to shifting by 0, so R shifted by 4 is R. But earlier, we saw that for k=2, R shifted by 2 is ~R, and for k=6, which is equivalent to shifting by -2, R shifted by 6 is also ~R.

So, each R in k=2 is also in k=6. So, for these Rs, each is counted twice.

How many Rs are in this case? For k=2, we had 4 Rs, and for k=6, another 4 Rs. But some may overlap.

Wait, actually, for k=2 and k=6, the Rs are the same. Because shifting by 6 is equivalent to shifting by -2, so the condition R shifted by 2 = ~R is equivalent to R shifted by -2 = ~R, which is the same as R shifted by 6 = ~R.

So, the Rs for k=2 and k=6 are the same. So, total Rs in this case: 4.

Wait, but earlier, for k=2, I found 4 Rs, each of which would be counted for both k=2 and k=6, but perhaps they are the same Rs.

Wait, for example, R = {0,1,4,5}. Shifting by 2 gives {2,3,6,7} = ~R. Shifting by 6 gives {6,7,2,3} = ~R. So, same as shifting by 2, but in the opposite direction.

So, these Rs are counted twice each in the total (R,k) count.

So, total Rs in this case: 4.

Case 3: R is such that R shifted by 4 gives ~R.

These Rs are the 16 Rs found for k=4. But wait, some of these Rs might also satisfy shifting by other k's.

Wait, earlier, for R = {0,1,4,5}, shifting by 2 gives ~R. So, this R is also in k=2 and k=6.

Similarly, other Rs for k=4 might also be in k=2 and k=6.

So, how many Rs are unique to k=4?

Wait, let's take another R for k=4: R = {0,3,4,7}. Shifting by 4 gives {4,7,0,3} = R, which is not the complement. Wait, no. Wait, R is {0,3,4,7}, so ~R is {1,2,5,6}. Shifting R by 4 gives {4,7,0,3} which is R again. So, that's not equal to ~R.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if R shifted by 4 is equal to ~R, then R must be such that shifting by 4 inverts the set.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. For k=4, R shifted by 4 must equal ~R.

So, for R = {0,1,4,5}, shifting by 4 gives {4,5,0,1} = R. So, that's not equal to ~R. Wait, but earlier I thought R shifted by 4 gives ~R. Hmm, perhaps I was incorrect.

Wait, let me reevaluate. For k=4, R shifted by 4 equals ~R.

So, for R = {0,1,4,5}, shifting by 4 gives {4,5,0,1}, which is R. So, R shifted by 4 is R, not ~R. So, that contradicts the earlier assumption.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier reasoning was flawed.

Wait, for k=4, shifting R by 4 must give ~R. So, R shifted by 4 = ~R.

So, for R = {0,1,4,5}, ~R is {2,3,6,7}. Shifting R by 4 gives {4,5,0,1}, which is R, not ~R. So, R is not a solution for k=4.

Wait, so perhaps the Rs for k=4 are different.

Wait, let's take another R. Let R = {0,2,4,6}. Shifting by 4 gives {4,6,0,2} = R. So, again, R shifted by 4 is R, not ~R.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. For k=4, shifting R by 4 must give ~R. So, R must be such that R shifted by 4 is ~R. So, let's construct such Rs.

Let me try R = {0,1,2,3}. Shifting by 4 gives {4,5,6,7} = ~R. So, yes, that works. Similarly, R = {0,1,2,3} shifted by 4 is ~R.

Similarly, R = {1,2,3,4} shifted by 4 gives {5,6,7,0} = ~R.

Similarly, R = {2,3,4,5} shifted by 4 gives {6,7,0,1} = ~R.

Similarly, R = {3,4,5,6} shifted by 4 gives {7,0,1,2} = ~R.

So, these are four Rs. Additionally, R = {0,1,6,7} shifted by 4 gives {4,5,2,3} = ~R.

Similarly, R = {0,3,4,7} shifted by 4 gives {4,7,0,3} = R, which is not equal to ~R. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, so perhaps only certain Rs satisfy R shifted by 4 = ~R.

In fact, for R to satisfy R shifted by 4 = ~R, R must consist of two pairs of consecutive elements, each pair separated by 4 positions.

Wait, in the first example, R = {0,1,2,3}, which is four consecutive elements. Shifting by 4 gives the other four, which is ~R.

Similarly, R = {1,2,3,4}, shifting by 4 gives {5,6,7,0} = ~R.

Similarly, R = {2,3,4,5}, shifting by 4 gives {6,7,0,1} = ~R.

R = {3,4,5,6}, shifting by 4 gives {7,0,1,2} = ~R.

Similarly, R = {0,1,6,7}, shifting by 4 gives {4,5,2,3} = ~R.

R = {0,3,6,7}, shifting by 4 gives {4,7,2,3} = {2,3,4,7}, which is not ~R.

Wait, no. Let me check R = {0,1,6,7}: ~R is {2,3,4,5}. Shifting R by 4 gives {4,5,2,3} which is indeed ~R.

Similarly, R = {0,2,5,7}: shifting by 4 gives {4,6,1,3} which is ~R? Let's see: R = {0,2,5,7}, ~R = {1,3,4,6}. Shifting R by 4 gives {4,6,1,3} = {1,3,4,6}, which is ~R. So, yes.

Wait, so R = {0,2,5,7} is another R that satisfies R shifted by 4 = ~R.

Similarly, R = {1,3,4,6}: shifting by 4 gives {5,7,0,2} = ~R? ~R would be {0,1,2,3,5,6,7} minus R, which is {0,2,5,7}. Wait, no, R is {1,3,4,6}, so ~R is {0,2,5,7}. Shifting R by 4 gives {5,7,0,2} which is ~R. So, yes.

So, how many such Rs are there?

Well, R can be any union of two blocks of two consecutive elements separated by 4 positions.

Like {0,1,4,5}, {1,2,5,6}, {2,3,6,7}, {3,4,7,0}, {0,7,4,5}, etc. Wait, no, the blocks must be separated by 4 positions.

Wait, let me think differently. For R shifted by 4 to be ~R, R must consist of two pairs of consecutive elements, each pair separated by 4 positions.

So, for example:

- {0,1,4,5}: shifting by 4 gives {4,5,0,1} which is R, not ~R. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, earlier when R was {0,1,2,3}, shifting by 4 gives {4,5,6,7} = ~R.

Similarly, R = {0,1,2,3}, {1,2,3,4}, {2,3,4,5}, {3,4,5,6}, {0,1,6,7}, {0,2,5,7}, {1,3,4,6}, {2,4,5,7}, etc.

Wait, perhaps I need to find all subsets R where R shifted by 4 is ~R.

So, for each R, R shifted by 4 must equal ~R.

So, R is a 4-element subset such that R +4 = ~R.

So, R +4 = ~R implies that R is a subset where exactly half the elements are in R and half are not, and shifting by 4 inverts the membership.

So, for each element i in R, i +4 must be in ~R, and vice versa.

So, for each i, if i is in R, then i +4 is not in R.

So, R must consist of elements where no two elements are 4 apart.

So, R can be thought of as a subset where each element and its opposite (i +4 mod 8) are not both in R.

But since R has 4 elements, exactly two of them must be in the first half {0,1,2,3}, and two in the second half {4,5,6,7}, but with no element in R paired with its opposite.

Wait, no, because for each element i in R, i +4 is not in R.

So, in terms of the octagon, each element in R is not diametrically opposite to another element in R.

So, R is a subset of 4 elements with no two elements opposite each other.

So, how many such Rs are there?

In the octagon, there are 8 elements, each with a unique opposite. So, to choose R, we need to pick 4 elements with no two being opposites.

So, it's equivalent to choosing 4 elements such that for each element chosen, its opposite is not chosen.

So, the number of such Rs is equal to the number of ways to choose 4 elements without choosing any pair of opposites.

In combinatorics, this is similar to choosing an independent set in a graph where edges connect opposite vertices.

But the graph here is 4 disjoint edges (each edge connecting a pair of opposites). So, the number of independent sets of size 4 is equal to the number of ways to choose one vertex from each edge, with the condition that no two chosen vertices are adjacent.

Wait, but in this case, the graph is 4 independent edges, so choosing an independent set of size 4 is equivalent to choosing one vertex from each edge, and none of them are adjacent. But since the edges are independent, choosing one from each edge automatically gives an independent set.

Wait, no. Because each edge is independent, not connected to others. So, choosing one from each edge gives an independent set. Since each edge has two vertices, the number of ways to choose one from each edge is 2^4=16. But we need subsets of size 4, so that's exactly 16.

Wait, but that seems high. Wait, no, because each edge is a pair of opposites, and choosing one from each pair gives exactly 4 elements, none of which are opposites. So, yes, there are 16 such Rs.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried R = {0,1,4,5}, shifting by 4 gives R, which is not equal to ~R. So, that R does not satisfy R shifted by 4 = ~R. So, perhaps only a subset of these 16 Rs satisfy R shifted by 4 = ~R.

Wait, confusion arises because earlier I thought that for R shifted by 4 = ~R, R must consist of two pairs of consecutive elements, but that may not be the case.

Wait, let's take R = {0,1,4,5}. Shifting by 4 gives {4,5,0,1} = R. So, R shifted by 4 is R, not ~R. So, this R does not satisfy the condition.

But R = {0,1,2,3}, shifting by 4 gives {4,5,6,7} = ~R. So, that R satisfies the condition.

Similarly, R = {0,2,5,7} shifted by 4 gives {4,6,1,3} = ~R.

So, how many Rs satisfy R shifted by 4 = ~R?

Each R must be such that R is a subset of 4 elements where R +4 = ~R.

So, R is a subset where for each i, i is in R if and only if i+4 is not in R.

Which is the same as saying that R and R+4 are complements.

So, R is a subset where R and R+4 partition the octagon.

But R must also satisfy that R +4 = ~R.

So, R must be a subset where R and R+4 are complements.

Which is automatically true because R +4 = ~R.

So, R must be such that R +4 = ~R.

Which implies that R is a subset where R and R+4 are complementary.

So, the number of such Rs is equal to the number of subsets R where R and R+4 are complementary.

Which is equivalent to R being a subset such that R +4 = ~R.

So, how many such Rs are there?

Each element i is in R if and only if i+4 is not in R.

So, for each pair (i, i+4), exactly one is in R.

Since there are 4 such pairs, each contributing 2 choices, the number of Rs is 2^4=16.

But wait, when I tested R = {0,1,4,5}, it didn't satisfy R shifted by 4 = ~R, but according to this, it should.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let me check R = {0,1,4,5}.

Shifting R by 4 gives {4,5,0,1} which is R again, not ~R.

But according to the condition, R shifted by 4 should be ~R.

So, there must be a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, no, perhaps R shifted by 4 must be equal to ~R, which is the complement of R.

So, for R = {0,1,4,5}, ~R is {2,3,6,7}.

But R shifted by 4 is {4,5,0,1} = R, which is not equal to ~R.

So, this R does not satisfy the condition.

So, the earlier conclusion that the number of Rs is 16 is incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps the condition R shifted by 4 = ~R is stricter than just R and R+4 being complements.

Because R and R+4 being complements would require that R shifted by 4 = ~R.

So, perhaps the number of such Rs is equal to the number of subsets R where R and R+4 are complementary.

But in that case, R must satisfy R +4 = ~R.

So, for each pair (i, i+4), exactly one is in R.

So, the number of such Rs is 2^4=16.

But earlier, when I tested R = {0,1,4,5}, it didn't satisfy the condition. So, what's wrong here?

Wait, R = {0,1,4,5}: R +4 = {4,5,0,1} which is R. So, R +4 = R, which is not equal to ~R unless R is equal to its complement, which is only possible if R has size 4, which it does. So, R = ~R only if R is a self-complementary set.

But in this case, R +4 = R, so R is a fixed set under shifting by 4.

So, R is a subset where R +4 = R.

Which implies that R is a union of orbits under shifting by 4.

In this case, the orbits are {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}.

So, R must be a union of some of these orbits. Since R has size 4, and each orbit has size 2, R must be the union of two orbits.

So, the number of such Rs is C(4,2)=6.

But earlier, we thought it was 16. So, clearly, there's confusion here.

Wait, to clarify, R shifted by 4 = ~R.

So, R +4 = ~R.

Which implies that R is a subset where each element i is in R if and only if i+4 is not in R.

So, for each pair (i, i+4), exactly one is in R.

So, there are 4 such pairs, each with 2 choices, leading to 2^4=16 subsets.

But when we tested R = {0,1,4,5}, it didn't satisfy R +4 = ~R. So, why?

Because in R = {0,1,4,5}, 0 is in R, so 4 must not be in R. But 4 is in R, so this violates the condition. So, that R is not a valid solution.

Wait, but according to the condition, for each pair (i, i+4), exactly one is in R. So, if 0 is in R, 4 must not be in R. So, R cannot contain both 0 and 4.

Similarly, if 0 is not in R, then 4 must be in R.

So, R must be such that for each i, i and i+4 are not both in R.

So, how many such Rs are there?

This is equivalent to choosing one element from each pair (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7).

So, for each pair, choose one element. So, 2^4=16 possibilities.

But wait, when I took R = {0,1,4,5}, which includes both 0 and 4, it's invalid. So, how does that fit?

Because R = {0,1,4,5} includes both 0 and 4, which violates the condition. So, actually, the correct Rs are those that include exactly one from each pair.

So, for example:

- Choose 0 or 4.

- Choose 1 or 5.

- Choose 2 or 6.

- Choose 3 or 7.

So, each R is formed by choosing one from each pair.

So, R = {0,1,2,3}, {0,1,2,7}, {0,1,6,3}, etc.

Each such R will have exactly one element from each pair, so R shifted by 4 will be the other elements from each pair, which is exactly ~R.

So, for R = {0,1,2,3}, ~R = {4,5,6,7}, which is R shifted by 4.

Similarly, R = {0,1,6,7}, ~R = {2,3,4,5}, which is R shifted by 4.

So, these Rs satisfy R shifted by 4 = ~R.

So, the number of such Rs is 16.

But earlier, when I tested R = {0,1,4,5}, it didn't satisfy the condition, but that's because it was invalid. So, the correct Rs are the 16 subsets where exactly one element is chosen from each pair (i, i+4).

So, for k=4, the number of Rs is 16, each of which is counted once in the total (R,k) pairs.

Thus, these Rs are unique and are not counted for any other k.

Wait, but earlier, R = {0,2,5,7} shifted by 2 gives ~R, as we saw. So, R = {0,2,5,7} is counted for both k=2 and k=4.

So, in that case, R is counted twice.

Similarly, R = {0,1,2,3} is only counted for k=4, because shifting by 1,3,5,7 doesn't give the complement.

Wait, no. Let me check R = {0,1,2,3}. Shifting by 1 gives {1,2,3,4}, which is not ~R. ~R is {4,5,6,7}. So, no, R = {0,1,2,3} is only counted for k=4.

Similarly, R = {0,2,5,7} shifted by 2 gives {2,4,7,1} which is {1,2,4,7}, which is not ~R. Wait, no, ~R is {1,3,6,7} for R = {0,2,5,7}? Wait, no, R is {0,2,5,7}, so ~R is {1,3,4,6}.

Shifting R by 2 gives {2,4,7,1} = {1,2,4,7}, which is not equal to ~R.

Wait, so perhaps R = {0,2,5,7} is only counted for k=4.

Wait, confusion arises. I think I need to proceed methodically.

Each R that satisfies R shifted by k = ~R for some k is counted once for each k that satisfies this condition.

From earlier, the total number of (R,k) pairs is 102.

We have:

- 2 Rs counted 4 times each (the two alternating Rs): total 8.

- 4 Rs counted twice each (the Rs for k=2 and k=6): total 8.

- 16 Rs counted once each (the Rs for k=4): total 16.

So, total (R,k) pairs: 8 + 8 + 16 = 32. But earlier, we had 102. So, clearly, this approach is wrong.

Wait, earlier, for k=0, we had 70 Rs. For k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7, we had other Rs.

But now, after reevaluating, perhaps the Rs for k=0 are the only ones that are unique.

Wait, for k=0, R must equal ~R. So, R is a self-complementary set. In the octagon, the number of such Rs is C(8,4)/something. Wait, the number of self-complementary 4-element subsets.

Wait, for a set to be self-complementary, it must satisfy R = ~R. So, for each element, it's in R if and only if it's not in R, which is impossible unless the set is empty or the universal set, but since R has 4 elements, it's possible in a 8-element set.

Wait, no, in a 8-element set, a self-complementary subset must have size 4, and for each element, it's in R if and only if it's not in R, which is impossible. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, R is a subset, and ~R is its complement. For R to be self-complementary, R must equal ~R, which implies that R is equal to its complement. So, R must consist of exactly half the elements, which for 8 elements, R must have 4 elements. But R cannot be equal to its complement unless it's exactly half. So, yes, R can be equal to its complement, but in that case, R is a self-complementary set.

So, how many such Rs are there?

In the octagon, the number of self-complementary 4-element subsets is equal to the number of ways to partition the 8 elements into two equal subsets, which is C(8,4)/2=70/2=35.

But not all of these are self-complementary in the sense that R = ~R.

Wait, no, for each subset R, its complement is unique. So, the number of unordered pairs {R, ~R} is 70/2=35.

But in our case, R must equal ~R, which is only possible if R is equal to its complement, which is impossible unless R is the entire set or empty, which is not the case here.

Wait, no, R cannot be equal to its complement unless it's the entire set or empty. So, actually, there are no such Rs where R = ~R, except for the entire set and empty set, which have sizes 0 and 8, not 4.

So, for k=0, there are no Rs where R shifted by 0 equals ~R, except if R is size 4, but R cannot be equal to its complement. So, perhaps for k=0, there are no valid Rs.

Wait, that contradicts earlier reasoning. So, perhaps for k=0, the condition R shifted by 0 = ~R implies R = ~R, which is impossible for R of size 4. So, actually, for k=0, there are no valid Rs.

Thus, the only valid Rs are those for k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

So, total (R,k) pairs: 2 +4 +2 +16 +2 +4 +2 = let's compute:

k=1:2

k=2:4

k=3:2

k=4:16

k=5:2

k=6:4

k=7:2

Total: 2+4=6; 6+2=8; 8+16=24; 24+2=26; 26+4=30; 30+2=32.

So, 32 (R,k) pairs.

Now, we need to find how many unique Rs there are, considering overlaps.

From earlier:

- The two alternating Rs are counted 4 times each (for k=1,3,5,7). So, 2 Rs.

- The Rs for k=2 and k=6 are the same, each counted twice. So, for k=2 and k=6, the Rs are the same. How many? Earlier, for k=2, we had 4 Rs, each counted for both k=2 and k=6. So, 4 Rs.

- The Rs for k=4 are 16, each counted once.

So, total unique Rs: 2 + 4 + 16=22.

But wait, let's check for overlaps between k=2 and k=4.

For example, R = {0,2,5,7} is in both k=2 and k=4.

Wait, R = {0,2,5,7}: shifting by 2 gives {2,4,7,1} which is {1,2,4,7}, which is not ~R.

Wait, ~R is {1,3,6,7} for R = {0,2,5,7}.

Wait, no, R = {0,2,5,7}, so ~R is {1,3,4,6}.

Shifting R by 2: {2,4,7,1} = {1,2,4,7} ≠ ~R.

So, R = {0,2,5,7} is only counted for k=4.

Wait, but earlier, R = {0,2,5,7} was in k=2. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. For k=2, R shifted by 2 must equal ~R.

So, R = {0,1,4,5}: shifting by 2 gives {2,3,6,7} = ~R.

Similarly, R = {0,3,4,7}: shifting by 2 gives {2,5,6,1} = {1,2,5,6} = ~R.

Wait, R = {0,3,4,7} is another R for k=2.

So, for k=2, we have four Rs:

1. {0,1,4,5}

2. {0,3,4,7}

3. {1,2,5,6}

4. {2,3,6,7}

Each of these, when shifted by 2, gives their complements.

Now, checking if any of these Rs are also in k=4.

Take R = {0,1,4,5}: shifting by 4 gives {4,5,0,1} = R, which is not equal to ~R. So, not in k=4.

Similarly, R = {0,3,4,7}: shifting by 4 gives {4,7,0,3} = R, not ~R.

Same for the others. So, these Rs for k=2 are distinct from those for k=4.

Thus, the Rs for k=2 are 4 unique Rs, not overlapping with k=4.

Similarly, the Rs for k=4 are 16 unique Rs, not overlapping with k=2 or k=1,3,5,7.

And the Rs for k=1,3,5,7 are the two alternating Rs, each counted four times.

So, total unique Rs:

- Alternating Rs: 2.

- Rs for k=2:4.

- Rs for k=4:16.

Total: 2 +4 +16=22.

Thus, there are 22 valid Rs.

Therefore, the number of valid colorings is 22, since each R corresponds to exactly one coloring (R is red, ~R is blue).

Wait, but no, because for each R, there's a unique coloring where R is red and ~R is blue. So, the number of colorings is equal to the number of valid Rs, which is 22.

But wait, earlier, for k=1,3,5,7, each R is counted four times, but they are only two unique Rs.

Similarly, for k=2 and k=6, each R is counted twice, but there are four unique Rs.

And for k=4, each R is counted once, with 16 unique Rs.

So, total unique Rs: 2 +4 +16=22.

Thus, the number of valid colorings is 22.

But wait, let's think again.

Each valid R corresponds to exactly one coloring: R is red, ~R is blue.

So, each R is a unique coloring.

Thus, the number of valid colorings is 22.

But wait, earlier, when we had k=4, we had 16 Rs, each giving a unique coloring.

Wait, but when k=2, we have four Rs, each giving a unique coloring.

Similarly, for k=1,3,5,7, we have two Rs, each giving a unique coloring.

Thus, 16 +4 +2=22 colorings.

Thus, the number of valid colorings is 22.

Hence, the probability is 22 / 256.

Simplify 22/256: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 11/128.

So, m=11, n=128. They are coprime.

Thus, m+n=11+128=139.


The probability is $\boxed{139}$.
