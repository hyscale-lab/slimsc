Alright, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81 (since 9^2 = 81).

Okay, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me break down the problem.

First, let's consider how numbers are represented in base b. A two-digit number in base b is written as "d1 d0", which translates to d1 * b + d0 in decimal. Here, d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place.

Since it's a two-digit number in base b, d1 must be at least 1 (because leading zeros aren't allowed), and both d1 and d0 must be less than b (since in any base b, digits go from 0 to b-1). So, d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d0 can be from 0 to b-1.

The number n is then equal to d1*b + d0.

The second condition is that the sum of the two digits, d1 + d0, equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = d1 + d0.

But n is also equal to d1*b + d0. Therefore, sqrt(d1*b + d0) = d1 + d0.

Let me write this equation down:

sqrt(d1 * b + d0) = d1 + d0.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

d1 * b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side:

d1 * b + d0 = d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2.

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. Maybe I can express it differently.

Alternatively, let's denote s = d1 + d0. Then, the square root condition becomes:

s = sqrt(n) => n = s^2.

But n is also equal to d1*b + d0.

So, s^2 = d1*b + d0.

But since s = d1 + d0, we can write:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2.

Let me express this as:

(d1 + d0)^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0.

Expanding (d1 + d0)^2 gives:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0.

Hmm, that's the same equation as before. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + d0^2 - d0 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in d1. For given d0, we can consider this as a quadratic in d1:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0.

To have integer solutions for d1, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:

D = (2*d0 - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(d0^2 - d0).

Let me compute D:

D = (4*d0^2 - 4*b*d0 + b^2) - 4*d0^2 + 4*d0.

Simplify:

4*d0^2 -4b d0 + b^2 -4d0^2 +4 d0.

The 4d0^2 and -4d0^2 cancel out.

So, D becomes:

(-4b d0 + b^2) +4d0.

Factor terms:

D = b^2 -4b d0 +4d0.

Hmm, perhaps factor this differently:

D = b^2 + d0*( -4b +4 ).

Factor 4 from the second term:

D = b^2 + 4*d0*(1 - b).

Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, let's write it as:

D = b^2 -4d0(b -1).

Because:

b^2 -4b d0 +4d0 = b^2 -4d0(b -1).

Yes, that looks better.

So, discriminant D = b^2 -4d0*(b -1).

For the quadratic in d1 to have integer solutions, D must be a perfect square. Let's denote D = k^2, where k is a non-negative integer.

So, we have:

b^2 -4d0*(b -1) = k^2.

This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to relate d0 and b.

Alternatively, maybe another approach would be better.

Let me think
