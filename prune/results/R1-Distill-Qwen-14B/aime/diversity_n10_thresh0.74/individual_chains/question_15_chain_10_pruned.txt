Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. The condition is that these paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to understand what this means.

First, I know that on a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right typically means moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, I think that means we need to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination C(16,8), which is 12870. But of course, we have restrictions here.

The problem specifies that the path must change direction exactly four times. So, I need to figure out what that implies about the path's structure. Let's think: a path on a grid alternates between moving right and up. Each time it switches from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change. So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, that means it must switch direction four times throughout its 16 steps.

Wait, no, that might not be exactly correct. Let me clarify. When moving on the grid, a path can consist of segments of consecutive rights or consecutive ups. Each time the direction switches, that's a new segment. So, for example, a path that goes all the way right first, then all the way up, has only one direction change. Similarly, a path that alternates every step (R, U, R, U, etc.) would change direction 15 times, which is the maximum possible.

But in our problem, we need exactly four direction changes. So, how does that structure look? Let's break it down.

If a path has k direction changes, then the number of segments (consecutive R or U steps) is k + 1. Because each direction change starts a new segment. So, four direction changes mean five segments. Each segment is either a series of R's or U's.

Now, since our path starts at the lower left corner, the direction of the first segment can be either R or U. Let's say it starts with R. Then the next segment must be U, then R, and so on, alternating each time. Similarly, if it starts with U, the next is R, then U, etc.

So, the number of direction changes will determine the number of runs (consecutive steps in the same direction) in the path. With four direction changes, we have five runs. So, the path alternates between R and U, starting with either R or U, and has five segments.

But wait, since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), the number of R steps and U steps must each be 8. So, the sum of the lengths of the R segments must be 8, and the same for U segments.

Now, the key is to determine how many such paths start with R, have five segments (so four direction changes), and similarly for those that start with U. But because the grid is square (8x8), starting with R or U should be symmetric, so perhaps the number of paths starting with R is equal to those starting with U. So, maybe we can compute the number for one starting direction and double it.

But let's not assume that yet. Let me think through the process.

Case 1: The path starts with R.

So, the first segment is R's, then U's, then R's, then U's, then R's. Since we have five segments with four direction changes. Wait, no, five segments implies four changes: R, U, R, U, R. Or U, R, U, R, U. But wait, if we start with R and have five segments, that would be R, U, R, U, R, which is four direction changes. Similarly, starting with U would give five segments: U, R, U,
