Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville and what they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion? I remember that from my classes, but I'm a bit rusty, so let me think it through.

Alright, the problem states there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one common thing. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 owning diamond rings, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning garden spades. 

Additionally, it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four: the candy hearts and the other three items.

Wait a second, but all residents own at least a candy heart, right? So every resident is included in that set. So the total number of residents is the universal set here.

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- Let C be the set of residents owning a candy heart. Since everyone owns it, |C| = 900.
- D for diamond rings, so |D| = 195.
- G for golf clubs, |G| = 367.
- S for spades, |S| = 562.

We need to find the number of people who own all four items, which is |C ∩ D ∩ G ∩ S|. But since C includes everyone, this is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Hmm, the problem gives us the number of people who own exactly two items and exactly three items. I think I can use these to set up an equation using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Wait, inclusion-exclusion for four sets can get complicated, but maybe since we have exact counts for two and three, we can relate them to the overlaps.

Let me recall the formula for four sets. The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But in our case, the universal set is 900, and everyone is in C. Wait, no, actually, C is a subset of the universal set because everyone owns a candy heart. So, the union of D, G, and S is the entire set of 900 because every resident is in C, which is the candy heart owners. Hmm, not entirely sure about that, but perhaps I can proceed.

Wait, actually, the problem is about ownership of four items, but since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, maybe it's better to think in terms of
