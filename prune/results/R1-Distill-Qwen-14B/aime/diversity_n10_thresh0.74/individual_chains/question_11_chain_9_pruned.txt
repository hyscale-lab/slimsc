Okay, so I have this problem to solve. It says: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. 

First, I remember that for complex numbers, when you have a term like z and 1/z, if |z| is given, that might help simplify things. Since |z| = 4, that means z is a complex number on a circle with radius 4 in the complex plane. So z can be written as 4e^{iθ} where θ is the argument of z. 

Wait, but maybe I should express z as a real number and its imaginary part. Or perhaps, since we're dealing with real parts, it's better to write z in terms of its real and imaginary components. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use the polar form because it might simplify the expression when dealing with modulus and arguments.

So, let me try that. Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So substituting into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, that might be manageable. Let me compute each part separately.

First, let me compute (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}. 75 + 117i is a complex number. Let me compute its magnitude and argument. The magnitude is sqrt(75^2 + 117^2). Let me compute that:

75^2 is 5625, 117^2 is 13689. Adding them together gives 5625 + 13689 = 19314. So sqrt(19314). Hmm, that's approximately sqrt(19314) ≈ 139. So the magnitude is about 139. But perhaps I can factor this?

Wait, 75 and 117 have a common factor. Let me check: 75 = 15 *5, 117=13*9
