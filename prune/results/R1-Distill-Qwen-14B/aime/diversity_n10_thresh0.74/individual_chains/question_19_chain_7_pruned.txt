Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumradius is 13, the inradius is 6, and the incenter I is perpendicular to the circumcenter O in the line segment IA. So, IA is perpendicular to OI. I need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that must form a right angle at I. So, triangle IOA is a right triangle. Maybe I can use some properties of right triangles here.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me plug in the given values to see if that makes sense.

So, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*(1) =13. So, OI = sqrt(13). Okay, that's useful.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is the inradius, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle IOA. Let me see.

Wait, triangle IOA is right-angled at I, so by Pythagoras, OA² = IO² + IA².

But OA is the circumradius, so OA=13. So, 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA² → 169 =13 + IA² → IA²=156 → IA= sqrt(156). Hmm, okay.

Wait, IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A. I think there's a formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex. Let me recall.

I remember the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex, say A, is given by IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Let me confirm that.

Yes, the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). Because in the triangle formed by the inradius, the angle bisector, and the side, this relation holds. So, IA = r / sin(A/2).

We have IA = sqrt(156) = 12.49 approximately. But let's keep it exact. So, sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). So, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

But IA is also equal to r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). So:

6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39)
→ sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39)
Simplify that: 3/sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.

So, sin(A
