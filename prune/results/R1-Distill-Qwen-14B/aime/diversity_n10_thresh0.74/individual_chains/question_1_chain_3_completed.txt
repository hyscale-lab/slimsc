Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
This means 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, sqrt(2) = x / (y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)  --> (1a)

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
So, 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)  --> (2a)

Third equation:
log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4
Which means 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)  --> (3a)

Now, I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) that relate x, y, z. My goal is to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me denote that expression as E for simplicity.

E = log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of logarithms. Let me define:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

So, E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Now, I need to find a, b, c.

Looking back at the three original equations, let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation (1a, 2a, 3a) because logarithms can help linearize the multiplicative relationships.

Starting with equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)
Taking log₂ of both sides:
log₂ x = log₂ (y z sqrt(2)) = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2)
Which simplifies to:
a = b + c + (1/2)   --> because log₂ sqrt(2) is log₂ 2^(1/2) = 1/2

Similarly, equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)
Taking log₂:
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + log₂ 2^(1/3)
Which simplifies to:
b = a + c + (1/3)

Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)
Taking log₂:
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + log₂ 2^(1/4)
Which simplifies to:
c = a + b + (1/4)

So now I have a system of three equations with a, b, c:
1. a = b + c + 1/2   --> Equation (1b)
2. b = a + c + 1/3   --> Equation (2b)
3. c = a + b + 1/4   --> Equation (3b)

Hmm, this is a linear system. Let me write them down clearly:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

I can try to solve for a, b, c using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2 --> Let's substitute a in equations (2b) and (3b).

Substituting a into equation (2b):
b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
Simplify:
b = b + c + 1/2 + c + 1/3
b = b + 2c + 5/6  (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6)

Subtract b from both sides:
0 = 2c + 5/6
So, 2c = -5/6
c = -5/12

Wait, c is log₂ z, and since z is a positive real number, c can be negative. That's fine.

Now, from equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
We can write a = b + (-5/12) + 1/2
Which is a = b - 5/12 + 6/12 = b + 1/12

So, a = b + 1/12 --> Equation (4)

Now, let's substitute a into equation (3b):
c = a + b + 1/4
We know c = -5/12, so:
-5/12 = a + b + 1/4

But from equation (4): a = b + 1/12, substitute into above:

-5/12 = (b + 1/12) + b + 1/4
Simplify:
-5/12 = 2b + 1/12 + 3/12 (since 1/4 = 3/12)
So:
-5/12 = 2b + 4/12
Subtract 4/12:
-9/12 = 2b
Simplify:
-3/4 = 2b
So, b = -3/8

Now, from equation (4): a = b + 1/12 = (-3/8) + 1/12
Convert to common denominator, which is 24:
-9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24
So, a = -7/24

So, now I have:
a = -7/24
b = -3/8
c = -5/12

Let me check if these satisfy all three equations.

Check equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Left side: a = -7/24
Right side: (-3/8) + (-5/12) + 1/2
Convert to 24 denominators:
-9/24 -10/24 + 12/24 = (-9 -10 +12)/24 = (-7)/24
Yes, correct.

Check equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Left side: b = -3/8
Right side: (-7/24) + (-5/12) + 1/3
Convert to 24 denominators:
-7/24 -10/24 + 8/24 = (-7 -10 +8)/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8
Yes, correct.

Check equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4
Left side: c = -5/12
Right side: (-7/24) + (-3/8) + 1/4
Convert to 24 denominators:
-7/24 -9/24 + 6/24 = (-7 -9 +6)/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12
Yes, correct.

So, the values are correct.

Now, recall that E = 4a + 3b + 2c
So, plug in the values:

E = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6
3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8
2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = -5/6

So, E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Combine the terms:

First, combine (-7/6) and (-5/6): (-12/6) = -2

So, E = -2 + (-9/8) = (-16/8) + (-9/8) = (-25)/8

Wait, but the problem asks for the absolute value of E, so |E| = |(-25)/8| = 25/8

25 and 8 are coprime since their GCD is 1.

So, m =25, n=8, m +n =33

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Compute E again:

4a =4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6 ≈ -1.1667

3b=3*(-3/8)= (-9)/8 ≈ -1.125

2c=2*(-5/12)= (-10)/12 = -5/6 ≈ -0.8333

Adding them together:

-1.1667 -1.125 -0.8333 ≈ total is approximately -3.125

Which is -25/8 because 25/8 is 3.125.

Yes, that's correct. So the absolute value is 25/8.

So the answer is 25/8, m+n=25+8=33.


The given system of logarithmic equations can be rewritten in exponential form, leading to a system of linear equations in terms of \( a = \log_2 x \), \( b = \log_2 y \), and \( c = \log_2 z \). Solving this system yields \( a = -\frac{7}{24} \), \( b = -\frac{3}{8} \), and \( c = -\frac{5}{12} \). Substituting these into the expression \( 4a + 3b + 2c \) gives \( -\frac{25}{8} \), and the absolute value is \( \frac{25}{8} \). Thus, \( m + n = 25 + 8 = 33 \).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
