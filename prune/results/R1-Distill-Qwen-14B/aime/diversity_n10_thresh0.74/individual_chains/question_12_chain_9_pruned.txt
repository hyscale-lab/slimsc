Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when you read the numbers left to right for each row, their sum should be 999, and when you read the numbers top to bottom for each column, their sum should be 99. The grid example given has 0,0,8 in the top row and 9,9,1 in the bottom row, making the row sums 8 + 991 = 999 and the column sums 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. 

Hmm, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell needs to be filled with a digit from 0 to 9. Let me denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\ \hline
d & e & f \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]

So the top row forms the number "abc" which is 100a + 10b + c. The bottom row forms "def" which is 100d + 10e + f. The sum of these two numbers is 999. So mathematically, that gives:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Similarly, the columns are "ad", "be", and "cf". Each column forms a two-digit number. The sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99.

So the column-wise sum is:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Now, I need to find all possible assignments of digits a,b,c,d,e,f (each from 0 to 9) that satisfy both equations.

Let me write down the two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see if that simplifies things.

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99

Let me compute the left side:

100a -10a = 90a

10b -10b = 0

c -10c = -9c

100d -d = 99d

10e -e = 9e

f -f = 0

So left side becomes:

90a -9c + 99d +9e = 900

Let me factor out the 9:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100

Hmm, that's a key equation. Let me denote this as equation 3:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100. 

Now, I need to find digits a, c, d, e such that this equation holds. Remember that a, c, d, e are digits, so each can be between 0 and 9.

Wait, but 10a and 11d are parts of this equation. Let me think about possible ranges.

Since a is a digit (0-9), 10a can be from 0 to 90.

Similarly, 11d can be from 0 to 99 (since d is 0-9, 11*9=99).

So 10a +11d can be up to 90 +99=189, but in equation 3, it's 10a -c +11d +e =100. So 10a +11d can be up to 100 + c -e.

But since c and e are digits, c can be up to 9, e down to 0, so c - e can be up to 9.

So 10a +11d can be up to 109.

Wait, but 10a +11d is 10a +11d. Let me see: the maximum when a=9, d=9 is 90 +99=189, but in equation 3, 10a -c +11d +e =100. So 10a +11d = 100 +c -e.

Since c - e can be from -9 to +9, that would imply 10a +11d can be from 91 to 109.

Wait, let me re-express equation 3:

10a +11d + e = 100 + c.

But since c is a digit (0-9), 100 + c is from 100 to 109. So 10a +11d + e must be between 100 and 109 inclusive.

So 10a +11d + e âˆˆ [100, 109].

Hmm, that's a manageable range. So, for each possible a, d, e, c, we can check whether 10a +11d +e is between 100 and 109, and 10a +11d +e =100 +c.

But perhaps it's better to approach equation 3:

10a +11d + e = 100 + c.

Since c is a digit (0-9), 100 +c is between 100 and 109.

So 10a +11d +e must be equal to
