Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, I remember that in such games, it's useful to think about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting position (n) is a losing position, then Bob can have a winning strategy. So I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where the starting position is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Let me try to model this. Let's define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when n=0, but that's not a valid starting point because the game starts with at least 1 token. Wait, but if n=0, the game is over, so maybe that's a losing position because the player can't move.

Wait, actually, when n=0, the player whose turn it is has already lost because they can't move. So from the perspective of the previous player, they've won. So perhaps n=0 is a losing position for the current player.

But let's think more carefully. The player who takes the last token wins. So when n=1, the current player takes 1 token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position.

Similarly, n=4: the current player can take all 4 and win. So n=4 is W.

But what about n=2? If it's your turn and there are 2 tokens, you can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent who then takes it and wins. Or you can take 4, but you can't because there are only 2. So your only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then wins. So n=2 must be a losing position for the current player.

Wait, wait. Wait, if you're at n=2, you take 1, leaving 1. Then the opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is L because whatever you do, the opponent
