Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity and not equal to 1. Hmm, this seems a bit abstract, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \(\omega^n = 1\) for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so \(\omega^{13} = 1\). Also, since \(\omega \neq 1\), it's one of the primitive roots. I think that means it's a generator of all the other roots except 1 itself.

The product given is over all k from 0 to 12. Each term in the product is \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Let me see if I can factor or simplify this expression somehow.

Wait, maybe I can write each term as a quadratic in \(\omega^k\). Let's set \(x = \omega^k\). Then each term becomes \(2 - 2x + x^2\), which is a quadratic equation. So, the product is \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\) where \(x = \omega^k\).

But since \(\omega^k\) are all the 13th roots of unity, except when k=0, \(\omega^0 = 1\). So, for k=0, the term becomes \(2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1\). Interesting, so the first term is 1. Then, for k=1 to 12, we have the other roots.

Wait, but maybe we can consider the entire product, including k=0, and then see if it factors into something involving cyclotomic polynomials or something similar.

I recall that cyclotomic polynomials are minimal polynomials over the integers for roots of unity. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \(\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1\), since 13 is prime. But I'm not sure how that directly helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\) where x runs through all the 13th roots of unity. Then, this product would be equal to the resultant of evaluating the polynomial \(P(t) = t^2 - 2t + 2\) at each 13th root of unity and multiplying them together.

Wait, but I think there's a formula for the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of another polynomial. Specifically, if I have a polynomial Q(x) which has roots r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, then the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n P(r_i)\) is equal to the resultant of P and Q, which can be expressed in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of P and Q, but I might be mixing things up here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of complex numbers. Since each \(\omega^k\) is a root of \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), so \(x^{13} = 1\). So, for each term \(2 - 2x + x^2\), perhaps I can write it as \(x^2 - 2x + 2\), which is a quadratic. Maybe I can factor this quadratic or find its roots.

Let me compute the discriminant: \(D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4\).
