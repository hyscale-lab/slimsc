Okay, so I have this math problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to calculate this.

First, let me visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so moving from the lower left to the upper right would require moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves.

Now, the problem mentions that the paths change direction exactly four times. I think that means the path isn't just a straight line; it has to alternate between right and up moves, but the number of times it switches direction is four. Wait, no, changing direction four times would mean that the path has five segments? Because each time you change direction, you start a new segment. So, for example, if you go right, then up, that's one change. So four changes mean five segments.

Wait, no, actually, let me think. If you start moving right, then change to up, that's one change. Then change back to right, that's two. So each change adds a new segment. So four changes would result in five segments. Each segment is a consecutive sequence of the same direction.

So, the path has to consist of five segments, alternating between right and up. But how do I arrange that?

Let me think about the structure. Since the path starts at the lower left corner and ends at the upper right corner, the first move could be right or up. But in an 8x8 grid, the number of rights and ups in the entire path must each be 8. So, if the path starts with right, then the segments will be R, U, R, U, etc., or if it starts with U, then U, R, U, R, etc.

But since the path changes direction exactly four times, which is even, that means the path will have five segments, alternating between R and U. So, if the first segment is R, the next will be U, then R, U, R, U, R. Wait, no, five segments with four changes. So, the number of segments is four changes plus one, so five segments.

Wait, if it's five segments, then the
