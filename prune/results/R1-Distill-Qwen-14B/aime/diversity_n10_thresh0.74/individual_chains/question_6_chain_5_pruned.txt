Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let's take a deep breath and go through it step by step.

The problem says: Define f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, we have two equations:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

We need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of these two equations.

Hmm, okay. So intersections occur where both equations are satisfied simultaneously. That means we need to find pairs (x, y) such that both equations hold. So, we can think of it as solving the system:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

This seems a bit complicated because x is expressed in terms of y and y is expressed in terms of x. It's like a system of equations where each variable is a function of the other. So, maybe substitution is the way to go, but given the complexity, perhaps we can find a way to analyze it without explicitly solving for x and y.

Let me first try to understand what f(x) and g(x) look like.

First, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let me break it down. The innermost part is |x|, which is a V-shaped graph with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 shifts this graph down by 1/2. But since we're taking the absolute value of that, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| will reflect any part of |x| - 1/2 that's below the x-axis back up.

So, let's think about |x| - 1/2. The graph will have a V-shape, but the vertex is at (0, -1/2). So, it will cross the x-axis at points where |x| = 1/2, which is x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So, for |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| -1/2. For |x| < 1/2, |x| -1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes -( |x| -1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph that has a peak at x=0 with f(0) = 1/2, and it goes down to zero at x=1/2 and x=-1/2. Then, beyond that, it increases again as |x| increases beyond 1/2.

Similarly, let's analyze g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. The same idea applies. Start with |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So, |x| -1/4 is a V shifted down by 1/4. The vertex is at (0, -1/4), and it crosses the x-axis at |x|=1/4, so x=1/4 and x=-1/4.

So, for |x| >=1/4, |x| -1/4 is non-negative, so g(x) = |x| -1/4. For |x| <1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So, g(x) has a peak at x=0 with g(0)=1/4, and decreases to zero at x=1/4 and x=-1/4.

Now, the functions y and x are defined using compositions of these functions, with sine and cosine inside. Let's take the first equation:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

Let me unpack this step by step.

First, sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, because 2πx has a period of 1. So, as x varies, sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1.

Then, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's compute this.

First, compute |sin(2πx)|, which is always non-negative, so it's the same as sin(2πx) but reflected above the x-axis. So, it's a wave that goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0 every 0.5 units in x.

Then, subtract 1/2: |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. This will take values from -1/2 to 1/2 because |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1.

Then, take the absolute value: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. So, for |sin(2πx)| >=1/2, it's |sin(2πx)| -1/2. For |sin(2πx)| <1/2, it's 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So, f(sin(2πx)) will oscillate between 0 and 1/2. Because when |sin(2πx)| is 1, f(sin(2πx)) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 0, it's 1/2 -0=1/2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, f(x) is defined as ||x| -1/2|. So, when x is in [0,1], f(x) is 1/2 -x for x in [0,1/2], and x -1/2 for x in [1/2,1]. So, in terms of the range, f(x) will take values from 0 to 1/2.

Similarly, for |sin(2πx)|, which is between 0 and 1, f(|sin(2πx)|) will be:

- 1/2 - |sin(2πx)| when |sin(2πx)| <=1/2.

- |sin(2πx)| -1/2 when |sin(2πx)| >=1/2.

So, the range of f(sin(2πx)) is from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g(f(sin(2πx))) is 4 times that, so g takes a value between 0 and 1/2 and applies g, which is ||x| -1/4|.

So, let's compute g(z) where z is between 0 and 1/2.

g(z) = ||z| -1/4|.

But z is non-negative, so g(z) = |z -1/4|.

So, for z <=1/4, g(z)=1/4 -z.

For z>1/4, g(z)=z -1/4.

So, when z is 0, g(z)=1/4. When z=1/4, g(z)=0. When z=1/2, g(z)=1/2 -1/4=1/4.

So, g(z) is a tent function that goes from 1/4 at z=0, down to 0 at z=1/4, then back up to 1/4 at z=1/2.

Thus, 4*g(z) will scale this by a factor of 4. So, at z=0, 4*g(z)=1. At z=1/4, it's 0. At z=1/2, it's 1 again.

So, 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1, with a certain shape.

Wait, let's write this more carefully.

So, y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))).

Breaking it down:

1. sin(2πx) varies between -1 and 1.

2. |sin(2πx)| varies between 0 and 1.

3. f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| -1/2|, which is:

   - For |sin(2πx)| >=1/2, it's |sin(2πx)| -1/2.

   - For |sin(2πx)| <1/2, it's 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

   So, f(sin(2πx)) is between 0 and 1/2.

4. Then, g of that is as follows:

   Let z = f(sin(2πx)).

   So, z is between 0 and 1/2.

   g(z) = |z -1/4|.

   So, for z <=1/4, g(z) =1/4 -z.

   For z >1/4, g(z)=z -1/4.

5. So, 4*g(z) is:

   - For z <=1/4: 4*(1/4 -z) = 1 -4z.

   - For z >1/4: 4*(z -1/4)=4z -1.

So, 4*g(z) is a piecewise linear function that starts at 1 when z=0, decreases linearly to 0 at z=1/4, and then increases back to 1 when z=1/2.

Therefore, y =4 g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1, with a period determined by sin(2πx), which has period 1.

Wait, but we have sin(2πx), which has a period of 1, but because of the composition with f and g, the overall function y would have the same period as sin(2πx), which is 1.

Wait, but let's think about the composition.

So, the function sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. Then, f and g are transformations that don't change the period because they are absolute value functions, which are even and thus symmetric. So, the composition y would have the same period of 1.

Similarly, the other equation is x=4 g(f(cos(
