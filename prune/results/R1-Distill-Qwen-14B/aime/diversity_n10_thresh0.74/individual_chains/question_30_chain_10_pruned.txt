Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. 

Hmm, let me start by recalling that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. That's a key property I can use here.

So, the product is over all k from 0 to 12. Let me write that out more clearly:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I need to compute this product and then find its remainder modulo 1000.

First, maybe I can simplify the expression inside the product. Let's look at each term:

For each k, the term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to some known polynomial. Let me see.

Let me denote x = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x².

So, I have 2 - 2x + x². Let's rearrange that: x² - 2x + 2.

That's a quadratic in x. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots. Let me compute the discriminant:

Discriminant D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4.

So, the roots are complex: [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i.

So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Wait, so 2 - 2x + x² = x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, each term in the product is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the entire product becomes:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} [ (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)) ]

Which can be written as:

Product = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))]

So, I have two products: one involving (ω^k - (1 + i)) and the other involving (ω^k - (1 - i)).

Now, I recall that for roots of unity, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is the minimal polynomial x^{13} - 1, because ω is a primitive 13th root, so the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x) is x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1, but wait, actually, the product over all (x - ω^k) is x^{13} - 1 because ω^0 = 1, and the other roots are the primitive 13th roots.

Wait, more precisely, the product from k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x^{13} - 1. Because each ω^k is a root of x^{13} - 1 = 0.

So, if I set x = (1 + i), then the product over k=0 to 12 of ((1 + i) - ω^k) is equal to (1 + i)^{13} - 1.

Similarly, for x = (1 - i), the product is (1 - i)^{13} - 1.

But wait, in our case, the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a), which is equal to (-1)^{13} * ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) because (ω^k - a) = (-1)(a - ω^k). So, each term contributes a factor of -1, and there are 13 terms, so overall (-1)^{13} = -1.

So, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^{13} * ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = - (a^{13} - 1).

So, for a = 1 + i, the product is -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 )

Similarly, for a = 1 - i, the product is -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 )

So, putting it all together:

Product = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]

Simplify this:

= [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]

= [ (-1) * ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ (-1) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]

= (-1)*(-1) * [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]

= 1 * [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]

So, Product = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]

Now, I can compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

Let me first compute (1 + i)^n and (1 - i)^n in general.

I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4. So,

1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}

Similarly, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n π/4 }

Similarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n π/4 }

So, let's compute (1 + i)^13:

(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i 13 π /4 }

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i 13 π /4 }

But 13π/4 is more than 2π, so let's subtract multiples of 2π to find the equivalent angle.

13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π/4 + 3π. Alternatively, 1
