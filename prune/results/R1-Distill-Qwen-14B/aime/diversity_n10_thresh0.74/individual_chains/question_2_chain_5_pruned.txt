Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis a bit less than halfway to (0,1) because sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

Then, we have a family of segments F consisting of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ lies in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each PQ, P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q) such that the distance between P and Q is 1. That makes sense because the length of PQ is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1, so p² + q² = 1.

So, all these PQ segments are like lines from the x-axis to the y-axis, each of length 1, in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, not A or B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is part of the family F? Let me check: AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute its length. The distance between A and B is sqrt((1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a segment of length 1, hence AB is part of family F.

So, AB is one of these segments in F. The point C is on AB, but it's unique in that it doesn't lie on any other segment from F besides AB. So, for all other PQ in F, point C is not on PQ.

We need to find OC², where OC is the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as p/q, then find p + q.

So, first, I need to find the coordinates of point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment from F except AB.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since C is on AB, maybe I can parametrize AB and find where it intersects the other segments PQ, then find a point C that only lies on AB and no other PQ.

But actually, the problem says there is a unique such point. So perhaps this point is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because in families of curves, the envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if we can find the envelope of family F, then the point C would be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where the envelope of the family F intersects AB, other than at A or B.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think more carefully.

Each segment PQ is of unit length, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So, for each PQ, we have P = (p, 0), Q = (0, q), with p² + q² = 1.

So, for each p and q satisfying p² + q² = 1, we have the segment from (p,0) to (0,q). The equation of this line can be found.

The equation of line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. That's the intercept form of the line equation.

Now, the family F consists of all such lines with p² + q² = 1.

We can think of this as a one-parameter family of lines, but with a constraint. Maybe we can parameterize p and q in terms of an angle theta.

Let me try that. Let’s set p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), since p² + q² = 1. Then, the equation of line PQ would be x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) = 1.

So, for each theta, we have a line x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) = 1.

This is a family of lines parameterized by theta. Now, we can think of the envelope of this family.

The envelope of a family of curves F(x,y,theta) = 0 satisfies both F(x,y,theta) = 0 and dF/dtheta = 0.

So, let me write F(x,y,theta) as x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) - 1 = 0.

Compute dF/dtheta:

dF/dtheta = x * (sin(theta) / cos²(theta)) + y * (-cos(theta) / sin²(theta)).

Set this equal to zero:

x * (sin(theta) / cos²(theta)) - y * (cos(theta) / sin²(theta)) = 0.

So, from F(x,y,theta)=0: x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) = 1.

We have two equations:

1. x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) = 1

2. x * sin(theta) / cos²(theta) - y * cos(theta) / sin²(theta) = 0

We can try to solve these two equations for x and y in terms of theta.

Let me denote equation 1 as:

x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) = 1 --> equation (1)

Equation 2:

x sin(theta) / cos²(theta) - y cos(theta) / sin²(theta) = 0 --> equation (2)

Let me rewrite equation (2) as:

x sin(theta) / cos²(theta) = y cos(theta) / sin²(theta)

So,

x sin(theta) / cos²(theta) = y cos(theta) / sin²(theta)

Cross-multiplying:

x sin^3(theta) = y cos^3(theta)

So,

y = x (sin^3(theta) / cos^3(theta)) = x tan^3(theta)

So, y = x tan^3(theta) --> equation (3)

Now, substitute equation (3) into equation (1):

x / cos(theta) + (x tan^3(theta)) / sin(theta) = 1

Simplify:

x / cos(theta) + x tan^3(theta) / sin(theta) = 1

But tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta), so tan^3(theta) = sin^3(theta)/cos^3(theta)

So, substituting:

x / cos(theta) + x (sin^3(theta)/cos^3(theta)) / sin(theta) ) = 1

Simplify the second term:

x (sin^3(theta)/cos^3(theta)) / sin(theta) = x (sin^2(theta)/cos^3(theta))

So, equation becomes:

x [1 / cos(theta) + sin^2(theta)/cos^3(theta)] = 1

Factor out 1 / cos(theta):

x [ (1 + sin^2(theta)/cos^2(theta)) / cos(theta) ) ] = 1

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

1 / cos(theta) + sin^2(theta)/cos^3(theta) = [cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta)] / cos^3(theta) = [1]/cos^3(theta)

Because cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1.

So, the equation becomes:

x * [1 / cos^3(theta)] = 1

Therefore,

x = cos^3(theta)

Then, from equation (3), y = x tan^3(theta) = cos^3(theta) * (sin^3(theta)/cos^3(theta)) ) = sin^3(theta)

So, the envelope is the parametric curve:

x = cos^3(theta)

y = sin^3(theta)

Which is the astroid curve. So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

But wait, let me check: for the astroid, the equation is (x/a)^(2/3) + (y/b)^(2/3) = 1. In our case, a = b = 1, so the equation is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Now, the point C is on AB and is the unique point that doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB. So, that point is where AB is tangent to the astroid.

Wait, why? Because if AB is part of the family F, and C is a point on AB that's also on the envelope, then AB is tangent to the envelope at point C. So, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.

So, to find point C, we can find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, let's find the equation of AB.

Points A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the line AB can be found.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, equation of AB: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)

So, y = -sqrt(3) x + (sqrt(3)/2)

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, we need to find the point (x, y) on AB that is also on the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, and where AB is tangent to the astroid.

So, to find the point of tangency, we can solve the system:

1. y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

2. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

And, the condition that the derivative of the astroid at that point equals the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

So, let's compute the derivative of the astroid.

The astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Differentiate both sides with respect to x:

(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0

So,

dy/dx = - [ (2/3)x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3)y^(-1/3) ] = - [ x^(-1/3) / y^(-1/3) ] = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) )

So, the slope of the astroid at point (x, y) is dy/dx = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) )

We know that at the point of tangency, this slope must be equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3). So,

- (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) ) = -sqrt(3)

Simplify:

(y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) ) = sqrt(3)

So,

(y / x )^(1/3) = sqrt(3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

y / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = (3^(1/2))^3 = 3^(3/2) = 3 * sqrt(3)

So,

y = 3 * sqrt(3) * x

So, equation 4: y = 3 sqrt(3) x

But we also have equation 1: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

So, set 3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

3 x = -x + 1/2

Bring -x to left:

3x + x = 1/2 --> 4x = 1/2 --> x = 1/8

Then, y = 3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

Wait, let me confirm that point C is on AB and on the astroid.

First, check if it's on AB: plug into AB's equation.

y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

So, plugging x=1/8:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8, which matches.

Now, check if it's on the astroid: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = ( (1/8)^(2/3) ) + ( (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3) )

Compute each term:

(1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3)) / (8^(2/3)) = 1 / ( (8^(1/3))^2 ) = 1 / (2^2) = 1/4

Similarly, (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3) = ( (3^(3/2)) / 8 )^(2/3 )

Wait, 3 sqrt(3) is 3 * 3^(1/2) = 3^(3/2). So,

(3^(3/2)/8 )^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3) ) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / (8^(2/3)) ) = 3^1 / (4) = 3/4

So, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which satisfies the astroid equation.

Great, so point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

Now, we need to find OC², which is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.

Compute:

(1/8)^2 = 1/64

(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64

Add them together: 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16

So, OC² = 7/16.

Thus, p=7, q=16, which are coprime. So, p + q = 23.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, OC squared is x² + y².

x = 1/8, so x² = 1/64.

y = 3 sqrt(3)/8, so y² = (9 *
