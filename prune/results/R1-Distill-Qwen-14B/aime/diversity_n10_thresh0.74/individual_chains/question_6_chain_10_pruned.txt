Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Both f and g are absolute value functions, so I think they will create piecewise linear graphs. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand f(x) and g(x). The function f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|. So, that's the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2. Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|.

I remember that absolute value functions create V-shapes. So, when I have |x|, it's a V with its vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 inside the absolute value, like |x| - 1/2, would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, ||x| - 1/2|, that would flip the part that goes below the x-axis back up. So, f(x) would have vertices where |x| - 1/2 is zero, which is at x = ±1/2. So, f(x) would create a W shape, I think, with vertices at x = -1/2, 0, and 1/2.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. That should also create a piecewise linear graph with vertices at x = -1/4, 0, and 1/4. So, it's like a V that's been shifted and then flipped.

Now, the functions y and x in the problem are compositions of these functions with sine and cosine. Let me write them out:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))
x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, both y and x are defined in terms of each other through these nested functions. This seems complicated, but maybe I can find a way to express one variable in terms of the other.

Let me first analyze the inner functions. Let's consider f(sin(2πx)) first.

Since sin(2πx) is a periodic function with period 1, right? Because the sine function normally has a period of 2π, so sin(2πx) has a period of 1. So, it's a sine wave that goes from 0 to 1, peaks at 1, goes back to 0 at 0.5, down to -1 at 1, and back to 0 at 2, and so on.

But since we're taking the absolute value, f(sin(2πx)) becomes ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Hmm, this might complicate things a bit.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the range of sin(2πx). The sine function gives values between -1 and 1. So, |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1. Then, | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | is the absolute value of that minus 1/2. Let me think about it.

Let me consider the inner function: let z = |sin(2πx)|. So, z is between 0 and 1. Then, f(z) = |z - 1/2|. So, f(z) will have a minimum at z = 1/2, where it's 0, and it goes up to 1/2 when z is 0 or 1. So, f(z) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g(f(z)) is g(w), where w = f(z). Since w ranges from 0 to 1/2, let's see what g does to w. g(w) = | |w| - 1/4 |. But since w is between 0 and 1/2, |w| is just w. So, g(w) = |w - 1/4|. So, since w is in [0, 1/2], we can consider two cases: when w < 1/4 and when w >=1/4.

When w < 1/4, g(w) = 1/4 - w. When w >=1/4, g(w) = w - 1/4. So, the range of g(w) is from 0 (when w=1/4) up to 1/4 (when w=0 or w=1/2).

So, putting it all together, y = 4 * g(f(z)), where z = |sin(2πx)|.

Similarly, the x function is 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))). Let me go through the same steps.

First, let's consider cos(3πy). The cosine function normally has a period of 2π, so cos(3πy) has a period of 2π / 3π = 2/3. So, it's a cosine wave that completes a cycle every 2/3 units in y. The range is from -1 to 1.

Take the absolute value, so |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1. Then, f(|cos(3πy)|) is | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 |. Similar to before, this will have a minimum at |cos(3πy)| = 1/2 and maxima at 0 and 1.

So, f(|cos(3πy)|) ranges from 0 to 1/2. Then, g of that is | |w| - 1/4 |, where w is in [0,1/2]. So, same as before, g(w) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

Thus, x = 4 * g(f(|cos(3πy)|)) will have x ranging from 0 to 4*(1/4)=1.

So, both y and x are varying between 0 and 1? Wait, let's check.

In the y function: g(f(z)) ranges from 0 to 1/4, so 4*(1/4) is 1. So, y ranges from 0 to 1.

Similarly, for x, same reasoning: 4*(1/4) is 1. So, x ranges from 0 to 1.

Wait, but x is defined as a function of y, and y is defined as a function of x. So, they are both in [0,1]. So, the domain and range are both [0,1], but I need to find their intersection points. Hmm.

Wait, actually, the equation is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, each is a function mapping from x to y and y to x, respectively.

I'm trying to find the number of points (x,y) where both equations are satisfied. So, each (x,y) must satisfy both y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

This seems like a system of equations, but it's implicit because y depends on x and x depends on y. It's a bit tricky.

Maybe I can consider substituting one into the other. Let me see.

Let me denote:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))   ...(1)

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))   ...(2)

So, substituting equation (1) into equation (2):

x = 4g(f(cos(3π * y))) = 4g(f(cos(3π * [4g(f(sin(2πx)))] )))

That's getting complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the possible values of x and y, then find how many solutions exist.

Let me think about the possible functions.

First, for y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me see what this function looks like.

We can represent the function as follows:

1. Start with sin(2πx), which is a wave with period 1, going from 0 to 1, back to 0, to -1, etc.

2. Take the absolute value: |sin(2πx)|, which is a wave that goes from 0 to 1, back to 0, to 1, etc., with period 1/2.

3. Then, subtract 1/2: | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. So, when |sin(2πx)| is greater than or equal to 1/2, this will subtract 1/2, else, it will add 1/2. So, the graph will have peaks at points where |sin(2πx)| is 1/2.

4. Then, compute g of that: g(w) = | |w| - 1/4 |. Since w is in [0, 1/2], as established earlier, this will create another V-shape.

5. Finally, multiply by 4: y = 4 * g(w). Since g(w) ranges from 0 to 1/4, y will range from 0 to 1.

So, perhaps y is a periodic function with some pattern.

Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let me think about the function x as a function of y:

1. Start with cos(3πy), which has a period of 2/3.

2. Take the absolute value: |cos(3πy)|.

3. Subtract 1/2: | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 |.

4. Then, compute g: | |w| - 1/4 |, where w is the result from step 3, which ranges between 0 and 1/2.

5. Multiply by 4: x = 4 * g(w), so x ranges from 0 to 1.

So, both y and x are functions within [0,1], but with different periods.

Since both functions are periodic with different periods (y depends on sin with period 1, and x depends on cos with period 2/3), their composition might create a grid of intersections.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the possible values of y in terms of x and vice versa, then find when x and y satisfy both equations.

But that seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider that for each x in [0,1], y is determined, and then for each such y, x is determined. So, perhaps the system is symmetric in some way?

Wait, another idea: since both functions are within [0,1], and both are determined by other functions, maybe I can consider the intersection points in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].

Given that, perhaps I can analyze the behavior of these functions in this unit square.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for fixed points where x = y. Because if x = y, then the equations become:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πy)))

and

y = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, if x = y, then both equations must be satisfied. So, perhaps I can find solutions to y = 4g(f(sin(2πy))) and y = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

But I'm not sure if that's the only way they can intersect.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that for each x in [0,1], we can compute y and then compute x' from y, and see if x' = x.

But that seems computationally intensive.

Wait, perhaps I can plot both functions or find their periodicity.

Wait, let's think about the periods.

The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) has a period of 1 because sin(2πx) has period 1. But when we apply f and g, which are absolute value functions, maybe the period remains 1.

Similarly, the function x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) has a period related to 2/3 because cos(3πy) has a period of
