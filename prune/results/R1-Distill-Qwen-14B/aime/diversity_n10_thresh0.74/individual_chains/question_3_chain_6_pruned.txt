Alright, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the problem is about a lottery where Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize, and B is the event of winning a prize.

In this case, if Jen won the grand prize, then she must have at least two numbers matching, so A is a subset of B. That means A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and P(B), the probability that she wins a prize (which includes winning the grand prize).

Let me structure this.

First, total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), where C(n,k) is the combination formula. So, total possible combinations = 210.

Wait, because C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, total possible outcomes are 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four numbers match. So, how many ways can this happen? Well, Jen picks a specific set, and the lottery also picks that same set. Since the lottery picks 4 numbers, the number of favorable outcomes for A is just 1 (since there's only one combination that matches Jen's numbers). Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need P(B), the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers match the lottery's four numbers. So, B is the event that the intersection between Jen's 4 numbers and the lottery's 4 numbers is at least 2.

Alternatively, the number of matching numbers is ≥ 2. So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is the sum of combinations where exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers match.

Wait, but since the problem says "at least two," so exactly 2, 3, or 4. But 4 is already covered by P(A), which is part of B.

So, to calculate P(B), I need to compute the number of ways where the lottery's 4 numbers have 2, 3, or 4 matches with Jen's numbers.

Let me denote:

- Let K be the number of matching numbers. So, K can be 0,1,2,3,4.

But since B is K ≥ 2, and A is K =4.

So, to compute P(B), I need the sum of probabilities where K=2, K=3, and K=4.

But since K=4 is 1 case, as above, the rest are K=2 and K=3.

So, how do I compute the number of favorable outcomes for each K?

For K=2: The number of ways is C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because Jen has 4 numbers, we choose 2 to match, and the remaining 2 numbers in the lottery must come from the 6 numbers not chosen by Jen.

Similarly, for K=3: C(4,3) * C(6,1). Because we choose 3 numbers from Jen's 4, and 1 from the other 6.

And for K=4: C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for B is:

C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0)

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15, so 6*15=90.

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24.

C(4,4)=
