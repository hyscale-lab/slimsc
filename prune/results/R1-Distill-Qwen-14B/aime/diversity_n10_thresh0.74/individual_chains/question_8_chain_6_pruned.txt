Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, the problem involves symmetric expressions in a, b, and c. That makes me think maybe I can find a way to simplify this by using symmetric sums or something like that. Let me see.

The first condition is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. That's a linear equation, so it's about the sum of the variables. The second condition is a bit more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me write this in a different way to see if I can factor it or find a pattern.

Looking at the second expression, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. For example, a²b and a²c both have a squared. Similarly for the others. Maybe I can factor this expression in terms of a, b, and c.

Let me try to factor it:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, okay. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) as (300 - a), right? Because a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the expression:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So that's equal to 6,000,000. So,

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor this differently. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps considering the variables as equal or with some symmetry might help.

But maybe another idea: Let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, and let's think about other symmetric sums, like the sum of the variables, sum of their squares, sum of their cubes, etc.

Another thought: Maybe express the second equation in terms of S and other symmetric sums.

Wait, I remember that expressions like a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b can be expressed using the symmetric sums.

Wait, let me think. Let's denote:

Let me recall that for three variables, the standard symmetric sums are:

S1 = a + b + c

S2 = ab + bc + ca

S3 = abc

But in our case, the expression is different. Let's see:

Our expression is E = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

But since b + c = 300 - a, as before, so E = a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) as we had earlier.

Alternatively, we can compute E as:

E = (a²b + a²c) + (b²a + b²c) + (c²a + c²b) = a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Which is = a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

So, E = 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm. That's another way to write it. Maybe I can find a relationship between a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³.

Wait, I also know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, then:

300² = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So 90,000 = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + bc + ca)

Which rearranged is:

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

Hmm, okay. Let me denote Q = a² + b² + c², and P = ab + bc + ca.

So, Q = 90,000 - 2P.

Then, plugging into E:

E = 300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

So, 300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

But I also know that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Recall that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

So, substituting S1 = 300, S2 = P, and S3 = abc, we get:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3abc

Which is 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc

So plugging back into the equation E:

300Q - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000

We know Q = 90,000 - 2P, so substitute that:

300*(90,000 - 2P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each term:

300*(90,000 - 2P) = 27,000,000 - 600P

So,

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) - 3abc = 6,000,000

So,

300P - 3abc = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - abc = 2,000,000

So, 100P - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm, okay. So now I have another equation: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

So, to recap, we have:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

So, we need to find nonnegative integers a, b, c such that these two equations hold.

Hmm, this seems more manageable. Let me think about how to approach this.

Let me denote x = a, y = b, z = c for simplicity. So, the equations are:

x + y + z = 300

100(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2,000,000

Hmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of variables and try to find possible integer solutions.

Wait, since all variables are nonnegative integers, maybe it's feasible to assume that one of the variables is zero and see what happens? Or maybe two variables are zero, but that might not be useful.

Alternatively, perhaps assume that two variables are equal, which might help reduce the problem.

Alternatively, think of this as a cubic equation. Let's see.

Let me consider the second equation: 100(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can factor this equation or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, we have S1 = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc.

From the second equation:

100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000

So, S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000

But from the first equation, we also know that S1 = 300.

In the context of symmetric polynomials, I might need another relation to connect S2 and S3.

Wait, for three variables, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is:

t^3 - S1 t^2 + S2 t - S3 = 0

So, in our case, that would be t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 t - S3 = 0

But since we have S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000, we can substitute that into the polynomial:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 t - (100 S2 - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 t - 100 S2 + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps let me factor this:

Looking at terms with S2:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2(t - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, maybe that's not so helpful.

Wait, perhaps let me try to find possible integer solutions for a, b, c.
