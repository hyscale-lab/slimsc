Okay, so I need to figure out the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n must be a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is sqrt(81). So that makes sense.

First, I need to model the problem mathematically. Let's denote the two digits of n in base b as a and c, where a is the digit in the "b's place" and c is the digit in the "units place." So, in base b, n can be written as:

n = a * b + c

Since n has exactly two digits in base b, the digits a and c must satisfy:
- a is at least 1 (since it's a two-digit number, the leading digit can't be zero)
- a is less than b (since in base b, digits go from 0 to b-1)
- c is between 0 and b-1 inclusive.

So, a ∈ {1, 2, ..., b-1}, and c ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., b-1}.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. So:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But n is a * b + c, so substituting:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c

Let me rearrange terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0

Let me group like terms:

a^2 - a * b + 2ac + c^2 - c = 0

Hmm, maybe factor this differently. Let's group terms with a and terms with c.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me write this as:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps factor out a and c terms:

a^2 - a*b + 2ac + c^2 - c = 0

Wait, maybe factor a from the first two terms:

a(a - b) + 2ac + c(c - 1) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe express everything in terms of a and c.

Alternatively, let me think of this as a quadratic in terms of a:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Yes, that's a quadratic in a. So, for each base b, and for each possible c (from 0 to b-1), we can consider this quadratic equation in a. The solutions for a must be integers between 1 and b-1.

So for fixed b and c, the equation is:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Let me denote this as:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Let me compute the discriminant D of this quadratic:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (c^2 - c)

Let me compute this:

D = 4c^2 - 4b c + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c

Simplify:

D = (4c^2 - 4c^2) + (-4b c) + (b^2) + 4c

Which simplifies to:

D = -4b c + b^2 + 4c

Factor:

D = b^2 -4b c +4c

Hmm, we can write it as:

D = b^2 -4c(b -1)

For a to be an integer, the discriminant D must be a perfect square. Let's denote the discriminant as k^2, where k is a non-negative integer.

So, b^2 -4c(b -1) = k^2

Hmm, that's an interesting equation. So for each b, c, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Maybe that's a way to constrain possible c and b.

But perhaps that's getting a bit ahead. Let's think about for each base b, how many two-digit numbers in base b satisfy the condition a + c = sqrt(n), where n = a*b + c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it another way. Since a + c = sqrt(n), and n = a*b + c, then:

sqrt(n) = a + c

So, n = (a + c)^2

But n is also equal to a*b + c. So:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Which is the same equation as before.

Let me rearrange this:

(a + c)^
