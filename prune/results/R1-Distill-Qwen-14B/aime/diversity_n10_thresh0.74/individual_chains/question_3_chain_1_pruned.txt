Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of one event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A โฉ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, we need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize because winning all four numbers definitely means she has at least two. So, P(A and B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

Alright, so I need to find P(A) and P(B).

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the number of possible combinations is the combination of 10 choose 4. Let me calculate that.

10 choose 4 is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible winning combinations.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she picks 4 numbers, there's only one specific combination that wins the grand prize. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, she can have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers chosen. Since she can't have more than 4, we consider these three cases.

Alternatively, it's sometimes easier to calculate the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of winning a prize is not winning a prize, which would mean that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen. So, that could be zero or one of her numbers being chosen. So, P(B) = 1 - P(not winning a prize).

Let me try both approaches and see which is easier.

First, trying the complement approach: P(B) = 1 - P(0 or 1 of her numbers are chosen).

So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly k of Jen's numbers is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k), since she has 4 numbers, and the rest are 6 numbers not chosen by her.

Wait, hold on. Actually, no. The total set S has 10 numbers, and Jen picks 4. So, the remaining numbers not in her set are 6. So, if she has k numbers chosen, the remaining 4 - k numbers have to come from the 6 she didn't pick.

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly k of Jen's numbers is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). So, the number of combinations where exactly 0 of her numbers are chosen is C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1 * 15 = 15.

Similarly, the number of combinations where exactly 1 of her numbers are chosen is C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, total number of losing combinations (i.e., not winning a prize) is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of winning combinations is total combinations minus losing ones: 210 - 95 = 115.

Thus, P(B) = 115 / 210. Let me simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 รท 5 = 23, 210 รท5 = 42. So,
