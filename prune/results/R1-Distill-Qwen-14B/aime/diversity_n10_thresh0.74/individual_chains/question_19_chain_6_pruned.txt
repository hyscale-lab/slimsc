Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I should recall what the circumradius and inradius represent. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. Given those, R is 13, and r is 6.

The triangle has its circumcenter O and incenter I. The incenter is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from I to O. That seems like an important piece of information. Maybe this gives a relationship between certain sides or angles of the triangle.

I remember some formulas that relate R, r, and other elements of the triangle. One formula that comes to mind is the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me verify that. Yeah, I think that's correct. So OI squared is equal to R times (R minus twice r). Let me compute that with the given values.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, so OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, that's interesting. So the distance between O and I is sqrt(13).

But wait, the problem also says that IA is perpendicular to OI. That means the lines IA and OI form a right angle at I. So triangle AIO is a right triangle with right angle at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, AI² + IO² = AO².

But wait, AO is the distance from A to the circumradius. Since O is the circumcenter, AO is just the circumradius, which is 13. So AO = 13. Therefore, AI² + IO² = 13² = 169. We already found that IO² is 13. So AI² = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, AI = sqrt(156). Let me simplify sqrt(156). 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39) is 2*sqrt(39). So AI is 2*sqrt(39).

Okay, so now I have AI. What else do I know? The inradius is 6, which is the radius of the incircle. The formula for the inradius is r = A/s, where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter. Hmm. But I don't know the sides yet, so maybe that's not immediately helpful.

Wait, but I also know that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides.
