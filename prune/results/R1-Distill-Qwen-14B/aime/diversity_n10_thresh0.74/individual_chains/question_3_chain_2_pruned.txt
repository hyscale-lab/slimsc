Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand what's being asked. 

So, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. 

Alright, so first, I think I need to figure out two things: the probability of winning a prize and the probability of winning the grand prize. But actually, since it's a conditional probability, I think it's the probability of the grand prize given that she won a prize, which is P(grand prize) / P(prize). 

So, let me recall the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize. So, the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is P(grand prize) divided by P(prize). 

So, first, I'll compute the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is the total number of possible lottery outcomes. That's 10 choose 4, which is 210. 

Jen picks 4 numbers, so there's only one specific set that she has. The number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is also 210. 

Now, the number of ways she can win the grand prize is just 1, because all four of her numbers have to be chosen. So, P(grand prize) is 1 / 210. 

Next, I need to find the number of ways she can win a prize, which is having at least two of her numbers chosen. So, that means she can have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers chosen. Wait, but the grand prize is when all four are chosen, so in this case, the prize includes grand prize. So, when the problem says she wins a prize if at least two are chosen, that includes the cases where two, three, or all four are chosen. 

So, to compute the number of ways she can win a prize, I need to calculate the number of 4-number combinations that include exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers. 

Let me think: if Jen has 4 numbers, say A, B, C, D, then the number of 4-number combinations that include exactly k of her numbers is equal to (4 choose k) multiplied by (6 choose 4 - k). Because there are 4 numbers she has, and 6 numbers she doesn't have. So, for each k, we choose k from her numbers and 4 - k from the other numbers. 

So, for exactly 2: (4 choose 2)*(6 choose 2). 

For exactly 3: (4 choose 3)*(6 choose 1). 

For exactly 4: (4 choose 4)*(6 choose 0) = 1*1 = 1. 

So, the total number of prize-winning combinations is the sum of these three. 

Let me calculate each term:

Exactly 2: (4C2)*(6C2) = (6)*(15) = 90. 

Exactly 3: (4C3)*(6C1) = (4)*(6) = 24.

Exactly 4: 1.

So, total prize combinations: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check the arithmetic. 90 + 24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yes.

So, total prize outcomes are 115, and total possible outcomes are 210. So, P(prize) is 115/210. 

But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when calculating the number of ways to have exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching, I have to consider that the total number of possible combinations is 10C4 = 210, which I already did. So, 115/210 is correct for P(prize). 

But wait, another way to think about it: the number of combinations where at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen is equal to total combinations minus combinations with fewer than two. So, total combinations is 210. The number of combinations with 0 or 1 of her numbers.

So, number with 0: (6 choose 4) = 15.

Number with 1: (4 choose 1)*(6 choose 3) = 4*20=80.

So, total combinations without prize: 15 + 80 = 95.

Thus, the prize combinations would be 210 - 95 = 115. Which matches the earlier result. So, that seems correct.

So, P(prize) is 115/210. 

Now, P(grand prize) is 1/210, as we said earlier.

So, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. 

Wait, that seems too straightforward, but let me think again.

Wait, does that make sense? So, given that she won a prize, which includes all cases from exactly 2 up to exactly 4, the probability that she actually got all four is 1/115. That seems low, but given that the grand prize is only one case, and the prize includes 115 cases, it makes sense. 

But wait, let's see: 115 is the number of prize combinations, and only 1 of them is the grand prize. So, the probability is 1/115. So, m = 1, n = 115, which are coprime. So, m + n = 116.

Wait, but before I conclude, let me make sure I didn't m
