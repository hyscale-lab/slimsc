Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, we have to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to understand what these equations represent.

First, the sum a + b + c is 300. That seems straightforward. It's a linear equation, so without the second condition, the number of solutions would be a stars and bars problem. But the second condition complicates things.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm. Let me see if I can factor this somehow or express it in terms of symmetric expressions.

Wait a minute, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. So, for example, a²b is a squared times b, and so on.

I can try to factor this expression. Let me see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression can be rewritten as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Since a + b + c = 300, we can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c).

So substituting these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that down:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm. That's a bit simpler, but still a bit complicated. Maybe I can consider each term separately.

Let me define a function f(x) = x²(300 - x). Then the equation becomes:

f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

So, we need to find nonnegative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300 and f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to find possible values for a, b, c that satisfy this. Maybe by considering symmetry or possible cases where two variables are equal, or perhaps all three are equal.

Wait, if all three are equal, then a = b = c = 100. Let's check if that satisfies the second equation.

f(100) = 100²*(300 - 100) = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000.

So, f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 3 * 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. Oh, that works! So (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

But are there other solutions? Maybe. Let's think about whether other triples can satisfy the equation.

Suppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Then, since a + b + c = 300, c = 300 - 2a.

So, substituting into the second equation:

f(a) + f(a) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

So, 2f(a) + f(300 - 2a) = 6,000,000.

Hmm. Let's compute f(a) and f(300 - 2a).

f(a) = a²*(300 - a)
f(300 - 2a) = (300 - 2a)²*(300 - (300 - 2a)) = (300 - 2a)²*(2a).

So the equation becomes:

2a²(300 - a) + 2a*(300 - 2a)² = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

First term: 2a²(300 - a)
Second term: 2a*(300 - 2a)^2

Let me expand (300 - 2a)^2:

(300 - 2a)^2 = 90000 - 1200a + 4a²

So, second term becomes:

2a*(90000 - 1200a + 4a²) = 2a*90000 - 2a*1200a + 2a*4a²
= 180,000a - 2400a² + 8a³

Similarly, first term: 2a²(300 - a) = 600a² - 2a³

Now, sum of both terms:

600a² - 2a³ + 180,000a - 2400a² + 8a³
= (600a² - 2400a²) + (-2a³ + 8a³) + 180,000a
= (-1800a²) + (6a³) + 180,000a

So, the equation is:

6a³ - 1800a² + 180,000a = 6,000,000.

Let's divide both sides by 6 to simplify:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a = 1,000,000.

Bring 1,000,000 to the left:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation might be tricky. Let's see if we can find integer roots.

Possible rational roots would be factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible roots are divisors of 1,000,000.

But since a is a nonnegative integer and a + b + c = 300, a can be at most 300.

So, let's test a = 100.

Plugging a = 100 into the equation:

100³ - 300*(100)² + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000
= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000
= (1,000,000 - 1,000,000) + (-3,000,000 + 3,000,000)
= 0 + 0 = 0.

So, a = 100 is a root. Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor.

Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide the cubic polynomial by (a - 100). Let me use synthetic division.

Coefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000

Using a = 100:

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.

Multiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000.

Multiply 10,000 by 100: 1,000,000. Add to last term: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0.

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000).

Now, set the quadratic factor equal to zero:

a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0.

Solve using quadratic formula:

a = [200 ± sqrt(200² - 4*1*10,000)] / 2
= [200 ± sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2
= [200 ± 0] / 2
= 100.

So, the cubic equation factors as (a - 100)^2(a + 100) = 0? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the quadratic was a² - 200a + 10,000. Let me compute discriminant again.

Discriminant D = (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So, a = [200]/2 = 10
