Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.

We have two functions defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. The problem asks for the number of intersections between the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what f(x) and g(x) are. Both are absolute value functions, so their graphs will involve V-shapes. Let me try to sketch f(x) and g(x) mentally.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner |x| reflects everything to the positive side, then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down, and the outer absolute value reflects any negative parts back up. So, if I consider |x|, that's a V-shape opening upwards with the vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 would shift the vertex down to (0, -1/2), but since we take the absolute value of that, it becomes V-shaped again. So, f(x) is a V-shape that touches the x-axis at x = ±1/2 and goes upwards from there. So, it's like two Vs: one from (-∞, -1/2) to (0,0), and another from (0,0) to (∞, 1/2). Wait, no, actually, when you take ||x| - a|, it's a diamond shape with vertices at (a, 0) and (-a, 0), but the original function is |x|, so maybe f(x) is a V shape with its vertex at (0, 1/2), but no—wait, no, because when x is 0, |0| is 0, so 0 - 1/2 is -1/2, and absolute of that is 1/2. So at x=0, f(x)=1/2. Then, as x increases, |x| increases, so |x| - 1/2 increases, making f(x) = |x| - 1/2, but wait, no, because x could be negative as well. Let me better find the critical points.

For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, the expression inside the absolute value is |x| - 1/2. So when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. When |x| < 1/2, f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 )= 1/2 - |x|. So f(x) is a V shape that peaks at x=0, f(x)=1/2, and goes down to 0 at |x|=1/2, then increases again beyond that. So, it's a diamond shape with vertices at (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0), and (-1/2, 0). So f(x) is a tent map, peaking at 1/2 and touching the x-axis at ±1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's do the same analysis. The inner |x| - 1/4, so when |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 )= 1/4 - |x|. So g(x) is also a V shape peaking at x=0, g(x)=1/4, and touching the x-axis at |x|=1/4. So it's similar to f(x) but with a lower peak and narrower base.

Now, the functions we're dealing with are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). These seem complicated because they involve compositions of functions and trigonometric functions inside.

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this by considering the behavior of each function step by step.

Let me first analyze the composition f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(sin(2πx))), and similarly for g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's break down each step.

Starting with y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's consider the input to g is f(sin(2πx)). Let me denote that as a variable substitution.

Let me denote u = sin(2πx). Then, f(u) = ||u| - 1/2|. Then, g(f(u)) = ||f(u)| - 1/4|. Then, y = 4 * g(f(u)).

Wait, but f(u) is non-negative because it's an absolute value function. So |f(u)| is just f(u). So g(f(u)) = |f(u) - 1/4|. Therefore, y = 4 * |f(u) - 1/4|.

Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), let me denote v = cos(3πy). Then, f(v) = ||v| - 1/2|. Then, g(f(v)) = |f(v) - 1/4|. So x = 4 * g(f(v)).

So, the equations become:

y = 4 * | | |u| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |, where u = sin(2πx)

and

x = 4 * | | |v| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |, where v = cos(3πy).

Wait, perhaps it's better to write down the functions step by step.

Let me compute f(u) for u in [−1, 1], since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1.

So, for u in [−1,1], f(u) = ||u| - 1/2|.

Since |u| is in [0,1], | |u| - 1/2 | is another absolute value.

Let me think about f(u):

Case 1: |u| >= 1/2. Then, |u| - 1/2 >= 0, so f(u) = |u| - 1/2.

Case 2: |u| < 1/2. Then, |u| - 1/2 < 0, so f(u) = 1/2 - |u|.

So, f(u) is a function that peaks at 1/2 when u=0, and goes down to 0 at |u|=1/2, then up again when |u| >1/2, but since u is sin(2πx), which is between -1 and 1, for |u| >1/2, f(u) = |u| - 1/2.

So, f(u) is a V shape with a peak at (0,1/2), valleys at (1/2,0) and (-1/2,0), and then it goes up again beyond that.

Similarly, g(f(u)) is ||f(u) - 1/4|.

But since f(u) is non-negative, we can write g(f(u)) = |f(u) - 1/4|.

So, let's analyze h(t) = |t - 1/4|, where t = f(u). So, h(t) is a V shape with a minimum at t=1/4, h(t)=0 when t=1/4, and goes up as t moves away from 1/4.

But since t = f(u) can range from 0 to 1/2 (since f(u) is 1/2 - |u| when |u| <=1/2, and |u| - 1/2 when |u|>1/2. So when |u| >1/2, t = |u| -1/2, which can be up to 1 -1/2 = 1/2. So f(u) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

So, t ranges from 0 to 1/2. So for h(t) = |t - 1/4|, when t is in [0, 1/4), h(t) = 1/4 - t. When t >=1/4, h(t) = t -1/4.

So, the maximum of h(t) occurs at the endpoints. At t=0, h(0)=1/4. At t=1/2, h(1/2) = 1/2 -1/4=1/4. Between t=0 and t=1/4, h(t) decreases from 1/4 to 0, then increases back to 1/4 as t goes from 1/4 to 1/2.

So, h(t) is a V shape with the minimum at t=1/4, h(t)=0, and peaks at t=0 and t=1/2, h(t)=1/4.

Therefore, y =4*h(t) =4*|f(u) -1/4|. Since h(t) ranges between 0 and 1/4, y ranges between 0 and 1.

So, y is in [0,1].

Similarly, for x =4g(f(v)), where v=cos(3πy), we can do the same analysis.

v ranges between -1 and 1, so f(v) is the same as f(u), which is in [0,1/2]. Then, g(f(v)) = |f(v) - 1/4|, same as h(t) above. So x=4h(t), so x ranges between 0 and 1.

So both y and x range between 0 and 1.

So, our equations are:

y =4 * | | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | -1/4 |

and

x =4 * | | |cos(3πy)| -1/2 | -1/4 |.

So, it's symmetric in a way because both y and x are defined in terms of similar functions, just with different arguments.

Now, I need to find the number of intersections between
