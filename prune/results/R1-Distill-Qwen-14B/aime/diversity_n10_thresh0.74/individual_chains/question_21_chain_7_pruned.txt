Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if when written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n.

Let me break this down. First, I know that a two-digit number in base b can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The condition for b-eautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b (which is 10_b) and b^2 - 1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b). So n is in the range [b, b² - 1], and sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, and their sum is sqrt(n). Therefore, sqrt(n) must be an integer, so n must be a perfect square.

Wait, that's an important point. So n has to be a perfect square, because a and c are integers, and their sum is sqrt(n). So sqrt(n) must be an integer, which implies that n is a perfect square.

So, let me formalize that:

n = a * b + c, where a ∈ {1, 2, ..., b-1}, c ∈ {0, 1, ..., b-1}
sqrt(n) = a + c
Therefore, n = (a + c)^2

So combining the two expressions for n:
(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:
a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c

Let me rearrange the terms:
a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms differently. Let's subtract a*b and c from both sides:
a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe factor terms:

Let's group terms with a and c:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me write it as:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (c² - c)
= 4c² -4b c + b² - 4c² +4c
= (-4b c) + b² +4c
= b² -4b c +4c

Let me factor that:

D = b² -4b c +4c = b² + c (4 -4b) = b² -4c(b -1)

Wait, maybe I can rearrange:

D = (b²) + (-4c)(b -1) + 4c? Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to proceed step by step.

So, the discriminant must be a perfect square because a has to be an integer. So, D must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = k² where k is a positive integer.

So,

b² -4b c +4c = k²

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

b² -4c(b -1) = k²

Wait, that might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange terms:

b² -4c(b -1) = k²

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as:

b² - k² =4c(b -1)

Which factors as (b -k)(b +k) =4c(b -1)

Since c is a digit in base b, c ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., b-1}. So 4c(b-1) must be equal to (b -k)(b +k).

Now, since (b -k) and (b +k) are factors of 4c(b -1), and (b -k) < (b +k), perhaps I can find possible k's that make this equation hold.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this equation as:

(b -k)(b +k) =4c(b -1)

Which implies that (b -k) must be a factor of 4c(b -1), and likewise for (b +k). But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can express a from the quadratic equation. Let's go back to the quadratic in a:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

Using the quadratic formula, the solution for a is:

a = [ -(2c - b) ± sqrt(D) ] / 2

Since a must be a positive integer, the numerator must be even, and the sqrt(D) must be an integer (k), so let's let sqrt(D) = k.

Then,

a = [ (b - 2c) ± k ] / 2

But since a must be between 1 and b-1, we can set up constraints accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the initial equation n = a*b + c and n = (a +c)^2.

So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation:

(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0

Expanding:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Let me group terms differently:

a² + (2c -b) a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic in a, as before.

Let me denote this as:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

The solutions for a are:

a = [ -(2c - b) ± sqrt( (2c -b)^2 -4*(c² -c) ) ] / 2
