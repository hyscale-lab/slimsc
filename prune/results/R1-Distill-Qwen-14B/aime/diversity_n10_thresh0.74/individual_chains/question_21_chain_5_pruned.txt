Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking for.

The problem is about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met when expressed in base b. First, it has exactly two digits in base b. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, which is two digits. The sum of 6 and 3 is 9, and indeed, the square root of 81 is 9. So that makes sense.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are over ten numbers that satisfy the given condition.

Let me break this down. 

First, let's understand what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero, right? So, a must be at least 1, and both a and c must be less than b.

So, n can be written as n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a < b and 0 ≤ c < b. Also, the sum of the digits a + c must be equal to sqrt(n). So, we have the equation:

a + c = sqrt(n) = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me write that equation down:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root. That gives:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2*a*c + c² = a*b + c

Let me bring all terms to one side:

a² + 2*a*c + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange it differently. Let's see:

a² + 2ac + c² = ab + c

Let's subtract ab and c from both sides:

a² + 2ac + c² - ab - c = 0

I can factor some terms here. Let's see, perhaps group terms with a and terms with c.

Looking at the a terms: a² + 2ac - ab

And the c terms: c² - c

So, a² + 2ac - ab + c² - c = 0

Hmm, maybe factor a from the first three terms:

a(a + 2c - b) + c(c - 1) = 0

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation:

a² + 2ac + c² = ab + c

Let me move the ab to the left:

a² + 2ac + c² - ab = c

Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to express b in terms of a and c. Let me try that.

From the equation:

a² + 2ac + c² = ab + c

Let me subtract ab and c from both sides and then factor out b:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = ab

So, b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c) / a

Hmm, that's an expression for b in terms of a and c. But b has to be an integer greater than or equal to 2.

Alternatively, maybe I can express it as:

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c) / a

Which can be simplified as:

b = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

Wait, since a and c are integers, and a is at least 1, (c² - c) must be divisible by a for b to be an integer.

Hmm, that's a key point. So, (c² - c) must be divisible by a.

Let me note that: a divides (c² - c), which can be written as a | c(c - 1). Since c and c-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so a must divide either c or c-1.

So, possible cases: a divides c or a divides c-1.

That might help in finding possible a and c values.

Alternatively, let's think about the equation:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me denote s = a + c, so s must be an integer because a and c are integers. Also, since a and c are digits in base b, a can be from 1 to b-1, and c can be from 0 to b-1.

Then, s = sqrt(a*b + c) implies that a*b + c must be a perfect square, equal to s².

So, s² = a*b + c

But s = a + c, so substituting:

s² = a*b + c

But s = a + c, so let me express c as s - a. Then, substituting into the equation:

s² = a*b + (s - a)

Simplify:

s² = a*b + s - a

Bring all terms to one side:

s² - s = a*b - a = a*(b - 1)

So:

s(s - 1) = a*(b - 1)

Hmm, this seems promising. So, s(s - 1) must be divisible by a. Since s = a + c, and a and c are positive integers with c < b, s would be at least 1 + 0 = 1, but more likely, s is at least 2 because a is at least 1 and c is at least 0.

Wait, considering that s = a + c, and a is at least 1 (since it's the first digit of a two-digit number), c can be 0. So s can be as low as 1, but in that case, c would be 0, and a would be 1.

But if s is 1, then s(s -1) = 1*0 = 0, which would require a
