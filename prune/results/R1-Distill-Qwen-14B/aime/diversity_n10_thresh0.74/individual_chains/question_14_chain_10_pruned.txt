Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number, so I'm looking for the largest N possible that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Interesting. So, for example, if the original number is ABCD, then changing A to 1 (making 1BCD), changing B to 1 (A1CD), changing C to 1 (AB1D), or changing D to 1 (ABC1) should all result in numbers divisible by 7.

Wait, so every possible single-digit change to 1 must make the number a multiple of 7. That's quite a restrictive condition. So I need to find the largest four-digit number where altering any digit to 1 gives a multiple of 7.

Let me try to break this down. Let's denote N as a four-digit number with digits A, B, C, D. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, when we change any one digit to 1, we get a new number. Let's write expressions for each of these:

1. Changing A to 1: new number is 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This should be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: new number is 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. This should be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: new number is 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: new number is 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Divisible by 7.

So each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. Therefore, each of these four numbers modulo 7 should equal 0.

Let me write down the congruence conditions:

1. (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. (1000A + 100B + 10 + D) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, okay. So four congruences. Maybe I can express each of these in terms of N and the change?

Wait, N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, let's see:

Changing A to 1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A). So, 1000 + N - 1000A.

Similarly, changing B to 1: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = 100 + (N - 100B). So, 100 + N - 100B.

Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D = 10 + (N - 10C). So, 10 + N - 10C.

Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = 1 + (N - D). So, 1 + N - D.

So, each of these modified numbers can be written as:

1. 1000 + N - 1000A ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 100 + N - 100B ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 10 + N - 10C ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1 + N - D ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these expressions must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Alternatively, I can rearrange each equation:

1. N ≡ (1000A - 1000) mod 7
2. N ≡ (100B - 100) mod 7
3. N ≡ (1
