Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here about a torus and a sphere. I need to find the difference between two radii, r_i and r_o, which are the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere internally and externally, respectively. Then, express that difference as a fraction m/n and find m + n. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recap what a torus is. A torus is like a donut-shaped surface. It's generated by rotating a circle around an axis in the same plane as the circle. In this problem, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. So, when the torus T is resting inside the sphere, it's tangent internally along a circle, and when it's resting outside, it's tangent externally along another circle. I need to find the radii of these two circles and then subtract them.

I think the key here is to visualize the positions of the torus relative to the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere will just touch the outer part of the torus, and when it's outside, the sphere will touch the inner part of the torus. The points of tangency will form circles on both the sphere and the torus.

Let me try to model this mathematically. Let's consider the centers. The sphere S has a center, let's say at the origin (0,0,0) in 3D space for simplicity. The torus T can be thought of as centered along the z-axis as well since it's generated by revolving around an axis in its own plane. So, the center of the generating circle of the torus is at (0,0,0), but wait, no. Wait, no, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, maybe the center of the torus is closer or farther from the sphere's center?

Wait, no, perhaps the sphere is fixed, and the torus is placed such that it's tangent to the sphere. So, the sphere is fixed with radius 11, and the torus is placed either inside or outside, touching the sphere along a circle.

Alternatively, perhaps the torus is centered at the same point as the sphere? Hmm, not necessarily. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me think. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere must contain the entire torus. The point of tangency will be at the farthest point of the torus from the sphere's center. Similarly, when the torus is on the outside, the sphere is tangent to the inner part of the torus.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus in each case.

Let me denote the sphere's center as O and the torus's generating circle's center as C. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis
