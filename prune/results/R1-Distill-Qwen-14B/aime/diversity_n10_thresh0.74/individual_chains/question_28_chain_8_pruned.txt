Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter to each face. Hmm, the incenter is the point equidistant from all faces, right? That distance is like the radius of the inscribed sphere or something.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths. AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so opposite edges are equal. That probably means the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's isohedral or something? I'm not sure, but perhaps it's symmetric enough that I can find its volume and then use the formula for the inradius.

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius r can be found by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to find both V and S.

Wait, but to find V, I might need to find the volume using some method. Maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant? I think that's a way to compute the volume given all the edge lengths. Let me recall the formula. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

Volume squared is (1/288) times the determinant of the matrix:

| 0 1 1 1 1 |
| 1 0 a² b² c² |
| 1 a² 0 d² e² |
| 1 b² d² 0 f² |
| 1 c² e² f² 0 |

So I can plug in the given edge lengths into this matrix and compute the determinant.

Let me assign the edges properly. Let's let AB = sqrt(41), so a² = 41. AC = sqrt(80), so b² = 80. AD = sqrt(89), so c² = 89. BC = sqrt(89), so d² = 89. BD = sqrt(80), so e² =80. CD = sqrt(41), so f²=41.

So the matrix looks like this:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me check:

- The second row is 1, 0, a², b², c². So a² is AB²=41, b²=AC²=80, c²=AD²=89. So yes, Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89.

Similarly, Row 2 is 1, a², 0, d², e². a²=41, d²=BC²=89, e²=BD²=80. So Row 2: 1,41,0,89,80.

Row 3: 1, b², d², 0, f². So b²=80, d²=89, f²=41. So Row3:1,80,89,0,41.

Row4: 1, c², e², f², 0. c²=89, e²=80, f²=41. So Row4:1,89,80,41,0.

So the matrix is correct. Now, let's compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That seems a bit daunting, but maybe there's a pattern or symmetry to exploit.

Wait, the matrix is symmetric. Let's see. Each row after the first seems to have a kind of mirror symmetry. Maybe we can find some pattern or do row operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is "isohedral" or has some symmetry because opposite edges are equal. Maybe it's a kind of "equifacial" tetrahedron? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps it's a disphenoid.

A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So in this case, AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So yes, it's a disphenoid. I remember that in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using a simpler formula.

Wait, what's the formula for the volume of a disphenoid? I think it's (sqrt((a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)))/72? Maybe not, or perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Alternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the volume can be calculated using the formula sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me try to compute it step by step.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for the volume is 288 V^2 = determinant of the matrix. So once I find the determinant, divide by 288 and take the square root to get V.

So let's denote the matrix as M:

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

To compute the determinant, maybe I can perform row and column operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps I can use some properties of symmetric matrices. But calculating a 5x5 determinant by hand is going to be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or notice that the determinant can be broken down.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72, as I initially thought. Let me check whether that's applicable here.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, so let me see what the edges are. Let's say:

a = AB = sqrt(41) => a² =41

b = AC = sqrt(80) => b²=80

c = BC = sqrt(89) => c²=89

Wait, but in the formula, perhaps these are the edges meeting at a common vertex. Hmm, maybe not. I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the formula for a regular tetrahedron, but this isn't regular.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for coordinates for the tetrahedron to compute the volume. Since it's a disphenoid, perhaps it can be embedded in coordinate system in a symmetric way.

Let me assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me set point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This is a symmetric setup that often works for disphenoids.

So, with this coordinate system, the edges can be computed using the distance formula.

Compute AB: distance between A (x,y,z) and B (-x,-y,z). So AB² = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2 = 4x² +4y². But AB² is given as 41, so 4x² +4y²=41.

Similarly, AC is between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z). AC² = (2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2 =4x² +4z²=80.

Similarly, AD is between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z). AD²=0^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2=4y² +4z²=89.

So now we have three equations:

1. 4x² +4y² =41 => x² + y² =41/4

2. 4x² +4z²=80 =>x² + z²=20

3.4y² +4z²=89 => y² + z²=89/4

So now, let's denote:

Equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4

Equation 2: x² + z² =20

Equation 3: y² + z²=89/4

We can solve for x², y², z².

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2: (x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = 2
