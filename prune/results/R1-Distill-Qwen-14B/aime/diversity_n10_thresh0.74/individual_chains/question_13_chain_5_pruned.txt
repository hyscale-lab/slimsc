Okay, so I've got this problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop stops. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and then stops at a coffee shop. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the whole thing takes her 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. 

Now, the question is asking, if Aya walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how many minutes will her walk take, including the 't' minutes at the coffee shop.

Alright, so I need to find the time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time. 

Let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a rate, time, distance problem. The formula I remember is:

Distance = Speed Ã— Time

So, for the first scenario, where she walks at speed 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours. But that includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. Similarly, for the second scenario at speed 's + 2', the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes the coffee shop time.

Wait, so the total time is the walking time plus the coffee shop time 't'. So, if I can find the walking time for each scenario, I can set up equations to solve for 's' and 't'.

Let me denote the walking time as 't_walk' and the coffee shop time as 't_shop' which is 't' minutes. 

So, for the first case:

Distance = 9 km = s * t_walk1

Total time including coffee shop: 4 hours = t_walk1 + t_shop

Similarly, for the second case:

Distance = 9 km = (s + 2) * t_walk2

Total time including coffee shop: 2 hours 24 minutes = t_walk2 + t_shop

Wait a second, since the distance is the same, 9 km, I can express t_walk1 and t_walk2 in terms of 's' and 's+2' respectively.

So,

t_walk1 = 9 / s

t_walk2 = 9 / (s + 2)

And the total times are:

t_walk1 + t_shop = 4 hours

t_walk2 + t_shop = 2 hours 24 minutes

Hmm, but the time units are in hours for the first case and in hours and minutes for the second. I should convert everything into the same unit to avoid confusion. Let me convert everything into hours.

First, 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 hours. 24 minutes is 0.4 hours, so total is 2.4 hours. Similarly, the coffee shop time 't' is given in minutes, but I think I should convert it to hours as well.

Wait, but in the problem statement, 't' is in minutes. So, maybe it's better to convert the total times into minutes. Let's try that.

Total time for first case: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Total time for second case: 2 hours 24 minutes = 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes.

So, now, the equations become:

t_walk1 + t_shop = 240 minutes

t_walk2 + t_shop = 144 minutes

But t_walk1 is 9/s hours, which would be (9/s)*60 minutes. Similarly, t_walk2 is 9/(s+2) hours, which is (9/(s+2))*60 minutes.

Wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of hours. Let me stick to hours.
