Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me see. I need to find out how many residents own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. 

Wait, the problem says that every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. That's interesting. So, the candy hearts are universal—everyone has them. So, the four items are diamond ring (let's call that D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). But since everyone has C, maybe that simplifies some things.

Let me jot down the numbers given:

- Total residents: 900
- Own D: 195
- Own G: 367
- Own S: 562
- Everyone owns C, so C is 900.
- Exactly two items: 437 residents
- Exactly three items: 234 residents
- We need to find exactly four items.

Hmm, okay, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that for multiple sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the union by considering all possible intersections.

But wait, the problem gives me the number of people who own exactly two and exactly three items. So, maybe I can use that information to find the number who own all four.

Let me recall the formula. The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets says:

Total = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since everyone owns C, maybe that can be factored in. Because C is universal, any intersection involving C is just the other sets. For example, D∩C is just D, since all D owners also have C. Similarly, G∩C is G, S∩C is S, etc. So, actually, all the individual sets are subsets of C.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let me think differently. Maybe it's better to model this using the counts of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.

I remember that in inclusion-exclusion, the counts of people owning exactly a certain number of items are related to the unions and intersections. 

Let me consider the inclusion-exclusion formula for the union of three sets first, but in this case, we have four sets. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this with the concept of the principle for multiple sets.

Wait, the problem gives the number of people with exactly two, exactly three, and asks for exactly four. Maybe I can express the total number in terms of these.

Let me denote:

- a = number of people who own exactly 1 item
- b = exactly 2 (given as 437)
- c = exactly 3 (given as 234)
- d = exactly 4 (what we're looking for)

But wait, the problem says each resident owns at least one
