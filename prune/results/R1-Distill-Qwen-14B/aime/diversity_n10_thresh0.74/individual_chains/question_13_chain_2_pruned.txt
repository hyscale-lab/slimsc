Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes. Now, they want to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the coffee shop time.

Alright, so the problem is about calculating the time taken for a walk at different speeds, considering the time spent in the coffee shop, which is a constant 't' minutes. The walk is always 9 kilometers.

Let me break it down.

First, when she walks at speed 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus 't' minutes of coffee shop. Similarly, when she walks faster, at 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which again includes 't' minutes.

So, the key here is that the total time given includes both the walking and the coffee shop time. That means the actual walking time is the total time minus 't' minutes.

So, for the first scenario:

Total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes (since 4 * 60 = 240). So, walking time + t = 240 minutes.

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert that to minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes. So, walking time + t = 144 minutes.

But wait, I can also express the walking time purely in terms of speed and distance. Because walking time is distance divided by speed. So, for the first case:

Walking time = 9 km / s km/h. But this walking time must be equal to the total time minus 't' minutes. Wait, no, actually, the total time is the walking time plus 't' minutes. So, walking time in the first case is (240 - t) minutes. Similarly, walking time in the second case is (144 - t) minutes.

But walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed. However, the speed is in km/h, so the walking time should be in hours, not minutes. So, I think I need to convert all times to hours or all to minutes to make it consistent.

Let me try working in hours. So, 4 hours is 4 hours, and 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. Similarly, 't' minutes is 't/60' hours.

So, for the first scenario:

Walking time (in hours) = 9 / s = 4 - (t / 60).

Because total
