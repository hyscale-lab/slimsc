Okay, so I've got this math problem to work on. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is asking for two things: first, the least prime number p where there's a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². 

Hmm, okay. So, in other words, we're looking for primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. And among such primes, we need the smallest one. Once we find that p, we have to find the smallest m that satisfies m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts. I remember that for primes p, if p divides n² + 1, then p must be 2 or congruent to 1 mod 4 because n² ≡ -1 mod p implies that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p, which only happens when p ≡ 1 mod 4. But wait, this is for n² + 1. Here, we're dealing with n⁴ + 1. So, maybe similar logic applies but perhaps with higher exponents.

Wait, n⁴ + 1 can be written as (n²)² + 1. So, if p² divides n⁴ + 1, then n² must be a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p². So, the existence of such an n implies that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p². But for that to happen, I think p must satisfy certain conditions.

I remember that if p is an odd prime, then for -1 to be a quadratic residue modulo p, p must be 1 mod 4. So, primes like 5, 13, 17, etc. Now, but does this extend to modulo p²?

I think it's a bit different. I recall that if p is an odd prime and p ≡ 1 mod 4, then -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p² as well. Because if x² ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, then it also has a solution modulo p². Let me confirm that.

Yes, Hensel's lemma says that if f(x) ≡ 0 mod p has a simple root, then it can be lifted to a root modulo higher powers of p. In this case, f(x) = x² +1. The derivative f'(x) = 2x. At a root x ≡ a mod p, the derivative is 2a. Since a ≠ 0 mod p (because a² ≡ -1 mod p), 2a ≡ 0 mod p only if p=2. So, for odd primes, the derivative is non-zero, so Hensel's lemma applies, and there's a unique lift modulo p². Therefore, if p ≡ 1 mod 4, then x² ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution.

Wait, but the question is about n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². But n² would have to satisfy (n²)² ≡ -1 mod p². So, if x² ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution, then n² can be such an x, so n⁴ +1 would be divisible by p².

So, primes p ≡ 1 mod 4 would allow solutions. But what about p=2? Let me check.

If p=2, then n⁴ +1. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4. For n even, say n=2k, n⁴ = 16k⁴ ≡ 0 mod 16, so n⁴ +1 ≡ 1 mod 16, which isn't 0. For n odd, n=2k+1, n⁴ = (2k+1)^4. Let's compute that modulo 16. 1^4=1, 3
