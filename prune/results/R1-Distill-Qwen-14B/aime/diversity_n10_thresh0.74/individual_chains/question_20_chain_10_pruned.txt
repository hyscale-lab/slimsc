Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I can use some of them. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, all chips in the same column must be the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let me break this down. Each row and each column can only have chips of a single color, right? So for each row, I can decide whether it's all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But wait, no, because if a row is white, then all columns that intersect with it must also be white in those cells. Similarly for black.

Wait, this might be a problem where the grid is divided into regions of the same color. Since every row and column must be uniform, I think the grid must form a kind of checkerboard pattern, but more generalized. Maybe it's similar to a bipartition of the grid into monochromatic rectangles.

Wait, no, perhaps not rectangles. Because the rows and columns are constrained, maybe each row is white, black, or empty, but the columns have similar constraints. But since the rows and columns affect each other, the entire grid's color assignment must satisfy both row and column constraints.

Let me think: if I color a row white, then all the cells in that row must be white, but each column that intersects with this row must also be entirely white. Wait, no, because a column could have white in some rows and black in others, but the problem states that all chips in the same column must be the same color. So if a column has any chip, all chips in that column must be the same color.

So, if a row is white, then every column that has a chip in that row must also be white. Similarly, if a row is black, every column that intersects with it must be black. But if a row is empty, the columns can be either color, but each column must be consistent.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me approach this differently. Since each row and column must be monochromatic (if they have any chips), the entire grid must be a union of some number of monochromatic rectangles. But wait, no, because the rows and columns are all in the same grid, the constraints might be more restrictive.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid must be partitioned into regions where each region is a rectangle (not necessarily same size) where all chips in that rectangle are the same color, and the rows and columns that go through these rectangles are entirely of that color.

Wait, maybe this is similar to a matrix where the rows and columns are partitioned into color blocks. For example, think of the grid as being divided into four quadrants, each with their own color. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the condition that any additional chip would violate the constraints implies that the placement is maximal, meaning we can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column constraints. So, in other words, the placement must be such that in every empty cell, either the row is full (so you can't add any more in that row) or the column is full (can't
