Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem states that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm, let me recall some properties of triangle centers and inradius and circumradius. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key condition. I remember that in a triangle, the incenter I and circumcenter O have certain relations, especially in terms of distances and angles.

I think the first step is to draw a diagram. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that forms a right angle at I between IA and OI. So triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at I.

Wait, no, actually, IA is perpendicular to OI, so OI is one leg, IA is another. So the triangle would be OIA, with a right angle at I. So in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So OI is the hypotenuse, and IA and IO are the legs.

Wait, no, wait. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then OI is a line, and IA is another line perpendicular to it at point I. So actually, IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning that IA is perpendicular to the line OI. So point A is connected to I, and OI is another line from O to I, and these two lines are perpendicular.

So, in other words, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle AIO is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle AIO, we can apply Pythagoras' theorem: AI² + IO² = AO².

I know that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter I and the circumcenter O is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall. Yes, I think so. The formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So substituting R =13 and r=6, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 1
