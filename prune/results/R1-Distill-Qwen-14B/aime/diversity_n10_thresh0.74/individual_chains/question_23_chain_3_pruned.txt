Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right because the positive term is with x². 

The problem says there are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD squared, but since it's the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, maybe it's the minimum upper bound, but I'm not entirely sure yet. Anyway, I need to figure out BD² and see what its maximum possible value is, but considering all possible rhombi, I think I need to find the minimum upper bound, but perhaps the supremum is the value we're looking for. Wait, the question says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." Hmm, that sounds like the infimum of the upper bounds. Wait, no, maybe it's the maximum possible BD² that is attainable, but the question is tricky. Let me think.

So, first, let's recall that a rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at right angles and bisecting each other. But in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, the diagonals must be symmetric with respect to the origin. That means if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C is (-x, -y), and similarly for B and D. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint between A and C, and between B and D.

So, points A, B, C, D are all on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DA. Hmm, but working with the lengths might be complicated. Maybe it's better to consider the properties of the diagonals
