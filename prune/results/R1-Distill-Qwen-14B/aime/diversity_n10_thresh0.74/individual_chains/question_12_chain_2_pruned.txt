Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. I need to figure out how many ways I can place digits in each cell so that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when I read the grid left to right, forming two numbers, their sum should be 999. The second condition is that when I read the grid top to bottom, forming three numbers, their sum should be 99. 

Hmm, let me try to visualize this grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So, the top row has three cells, and the bottom row also has three cells. If I read the grid left to right, the top row forms a three-digit number, and the bottom row forms another three-digit number. Their sum should be 999. 

Wait, actually, no. Wait a second, the problem says the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. So, maybe I misread that. Let me check again. Oh, the grid is 2x3, so reading left to right on each row gives two three-digit numbers. Their sum is 999. 

Then, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number, right? Because each column has two cells, one on top of the other. So, the first column would be the first digit of the top row and the first digit of the bottom row, making a two-digit number. Similarly, the second and third columns form two-digit numbers. The sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99. 

Wait, but in the example given, the grid is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

So, reading left to right, the top is 008, which is 8, and the bottom is 991. 8 + 991 = 999. Correct. 

Reading top to bottom, the columns are 09, 09, and 81. 09 + 09 + 81 = 99. So that's correct. 

So, the problem is to count how many such grids exist. 

Alright, let's denote the grid cells as follows:

a b c

d e f

So, a, b, c are the top row, d, e, f are the bottom row. Each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit (0-9). 

Then, the two numbers formed by reading left to right are abc (which is 100a + 10b + c) and def (which is 100d + 10e + f). Their sum is 999. 

So, equation one: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Equation two: The sum of the three two-digit numbers from each column. The first column is ad (10a + d), the second is be (10b + e), the third is cf (10c + f). So, their sum is (10
