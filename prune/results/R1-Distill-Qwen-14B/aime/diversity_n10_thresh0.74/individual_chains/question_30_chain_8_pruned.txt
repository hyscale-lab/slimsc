Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me recall what a 13th root of unity is. A root of unity is a complex number that, when raised to a certain power (in this case, 13), equals 1. The 13th roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. These roots can be represented on the complex plane as points on the unit circle spaced evenly around the circle. One of them is 1, but the problem specifies ω ≠ 1, so we're dealing with the primitive 13th roots.

Since ω is a primitive 13th root, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k = 1, 2, ..., 12. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

The product I need to compute is Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1. Let me compute each term for k from 0 to 12.

Let me write out the terms:

For k=0: (2 - 2*(1) + 1^0) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1
Wait, that's 1. So the first term is 1. Hmm, that's interesting. So the entire product is the product of 1 and then the other terms from k=1 to 12. So maybe I can factor that out. So the product becomes 1 * Π_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, that simplifies it a bit. Now, I need to compute Π_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Let me think about the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to some known polynomials. Let me rearrange the terms:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me let x = ω^k, so the expression becomes x² - 2x + 2. So each term in the product is x² - 2x + 2, where x is a 13th root of unity, except x=1.

Wait, so the
