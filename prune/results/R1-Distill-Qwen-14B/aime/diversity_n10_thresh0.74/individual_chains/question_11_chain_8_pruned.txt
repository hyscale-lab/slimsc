Okay, so I have this complex number problem here. Let me read it again: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. So, z is a complex number on the circle with radius 4 in the complex plane.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since z is a complex number with a fixed modulus, maybe I can represent it in polar form. That often makes things easier when dealing with moduli and arguments. So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That way, the modulus is 4, as required.

So, z = 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because the modulus of 1/z is 1/|z|, which is 1/4, and the argument is -θ.

Now, substituting z and 1/z into the expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z becomes (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately. First, (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}:

75 * 4 = 300, 117 * 4 = 468. So, that term becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Similarly, for the second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) = 24 + 36i. So, that term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I can write this as two separate complex numbers multiplied by e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}. Maybe it's helpful to express each of these as a complex number in terms of cosine and sine.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can combine these terms using Euler's formula. Remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

Alternatively, maybe I can write each term as a vector in the complex plane, and then think about adding them together.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the entire expression in terms of cosθ and sinθ, then find the real part, and then maximize it.

Let me try that. So, let me expand each term.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ.

So, combining real and imaginary parts: Real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ. Imaginary part is (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ -24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 is -1, so this becomes 24 cosθ -24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combining real and imaginary parts: Real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ. Imaginary part is (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Now, adding both terms together:

The entire expression's real part is [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ] = (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ.

Calculating that: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Similarly, the imaginary part is [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ] + [-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ] = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But since we're looking for the real part, maybe I can ignore the imaginary part unless I need it for something else. Hmm.

So, now the expression simplifies to real part 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, and the imaginary part is 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ. But we only care about the real part for the maximum.

So, our problem reduces to maximizing the real part, which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

This is a linear combination of cosθ and sinθ, which can be rewritten as a single sinusoid. Remember that A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and tanφ = B/A.

In this case, A is 324 and B is -432.

So, let me compute C: sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2).

Compute 324^2: 324 * 324. Let's see, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and cross terms are 2*300*24=14,400. So, 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432
