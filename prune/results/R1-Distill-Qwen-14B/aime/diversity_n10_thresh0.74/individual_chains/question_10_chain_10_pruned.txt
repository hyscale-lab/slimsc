Okay, so I have this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. So Alice picks some set A, and then Bob considers all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I have to find the sum of elements in A.

First, maybe I should figure out how the number of such sets B relates to the set A. Let's think about what a set B can look like. Since B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and its maximum is in A, each B is determined by its maximum element and the other elements in it, which must be less than the maximum.

So, for each element 'a' in A, how many sets B can have 'a' as their maximum? Well, if the maximum is 'a', then the other elements of B must be chosen from the positive integers less than 'a'. So, the number of such sets B with maximum 'a' is equal to the number of nonempty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, right?

Wait, but actually, for each 'a', the number of possible sets B with maximum 'a' is 2^{a-1}. Because for each element less than 'a', you can choose whether to include it in B or not. Since B has to be nonempty and have maximum 'a', the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set? Wait, no, because if you take the empty set, then B would just be {a}, which is allowed. So yes, the number of subsets is 2^{a-1}.

So, the total number of sets B is the sum over each 'a' in A of 2^{a-1}. Because for each a in A, there are 2^{a-1} subsets where a is the maximum. So, if A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then the total number of B's is 2^{a1 - 1} + 2^{a2 - 1} + ... + 2^{an - 1}.

And according to the problem, this sum is 2024. So, 2^{a1 - 1} + 2^{a2 - 1} + ... + 2^{ak - 1} = 2024, where A has k elements, say a1 < a2 < ... < ak.

But wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of binary representations or something. Because 2^{n} is involved, maybe the sum is a number that's a sum of powers of two, which could be unique. Hmm, because each 2^{n} is a different power, so when you sum them, each term corresponds to a binary digit.

So, 2024 in binary is... Let me compute that. Let me divide 2024 by 2 repeatedly.

2024 / 2 = 1012, remainder 0
