Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is about finding the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. So, it's a conditional probability problem. They want the probability expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then m + n.

Alright, so to find this, I remember that conditional probability is given by:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize (because if you have all four numbers right, you definitely have at least two right), then A ∩ B is just A.

So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B)

Therefore, I need to find P(A), which is the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and P(B), the probability that she wins a prize.

Let me compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of possible ways to pick 4 numbers from 10 is given by the combination C(10,4). Let me calculate that. C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four numbers match. So, there is only 1 such winning combination (the exact set Jen picked). So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen four. This seems a bit trickier. I think the best way to compute this is to find the number of ways that at least two numbers match, divided by the total number of possible combinations, which is 210.

But calculating "at least two" can sometimes be easier by subtracting the probabilities of the complementary events from 1. The complementary event of "at least two" is "zero or one" matches. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match)

So, let me compute P(zero matches) and P(exactly one match).

First, P(zero matches): this means none of Jen's four numbers are in the randomly chosen four. So, the four numbers chosen are all from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). The number of ways to choose four numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). C(6,4) is 15. So, the number of ways is 15. Therefore, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210.

Next, P(exactly one match): this is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is in the four chosen, and the other three are from the remaining six. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3). Let me compute that. C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, the number of ways is 80, so P(exactly one match) = 80 / 210.

So, putting it together, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me double-check that. 15 (zero) plus 80 (one) is 95. So, subtracting from 210, 210 - 95 = 115. So, yes, P(B) is 115/210.

Simplify that fraction: 115 and 210, let's see if they have a common divisor. 115 is 5 * 23, and 210 is 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. So, they share a common factor of 5. So, dividing numerator and denominator by 5: 115 ÷5 =23, 210 ÷5=42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, is that correct? Because 115 divided by 5 is 23? Wait, 5*23 is 115? Wait, 5*20=100, 5*3=15, so 100+15=115. Yes, correct.

So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, but earlier I had P(A) as 1/210, which is 1/210. So, now, to find the conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (2
