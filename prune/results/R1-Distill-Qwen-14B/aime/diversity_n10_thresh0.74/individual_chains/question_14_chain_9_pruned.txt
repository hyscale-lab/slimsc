Okay, so I have this math problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Alright, so first, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with a specific property. The property is that if you take any one of its four digits and change it to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. That's interesting. So, changing any single digit (thousands, hundreds, tens, or units) to 1 must result in a number that's a multiple of 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q and R where N = 1000*Q + R, and then find Q + R.

Let me try to think about how to approach this.

First, since N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, I should probably start by considering the largest four-digit number, which is 9999, and see if it satisfies the condition. If not, we'll decrement and check each subsequent number until we find the one that meets the criteria.

But checking each number one by one sounds time-consuming. There must be a smarter way.

Let's denote N as a four-digit number, say N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are its digits, with a being the thousands digit, b the hundreds, c the tens, and d the units. So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

The condition is that for each digit in N, changing that digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, we have four modified numbers to consider:

1. Changing a to 1: 1 b c d. Let's call this N1 = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d.
2. Changing b to 1: a 1 c d. N2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d.
3. Changing c to 1: a b 1 d. N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d.
4. Changing d to 1: a b c 1. N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1.

Each of these modified numbers N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these modified numbers, we have:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7
N2 ≡ 0 mod 7
N3 ≡ 0 mod 7
N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

We can think of each of these as equations:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, but since N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, perhaps we can express each modified number in terms of N.

Let me write each modified number in terms of N.

1. N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - (1000a - 1000) = N - 1000a + 1000.
Wait, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, N1 is N with the thousands digit changed to 1. So, N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

Similarly, N2 is N with the hundreds digit changed to 1: N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d.

N3 is N with the tens digit changed to 1: N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d.

N4 is N with the units digit changed to 1: N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1.

So, each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be 0 mod 7.

So, let's write each of them mod 7.

First, note that 1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 /7. 7*142=994, so 1000 -994=6. So, 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 /7=14*7=98, so 100-98=2. So, 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3, because 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod7=1.

So, now, let's compute each modified number mod7 as follows:

N1 =1000 +100b +10c +d ≡6 + 2b +3c +d mod7. This must be 0 mod7.

N2 =1000a +100 +10c +d ≡6a +2 +3c +d mod7. This must be 0 mod7.

N3 =1000a +100b +10 +d ≡6a +2b +3 +d mod7. This must be 0 mod7.

N4 =1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡6a +2b +3c +1 mod7. This must be 0 mod7.

So, we have four congruence equations:

1. 6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7. (from N1)
2. 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7. (from N2)
3. 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7. (from N3)
4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7. (from N4)

So, now we have four equations:

Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡ -6 mod7 → 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7)

Equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡ -2 mod7 →6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7

Equation (3):6a +2b +d ≡-3 mod7 →6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7

Equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7 →6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7

So, let me write these equations more clearly:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7  -- (1)
2. 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7     -- (2)
3. 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7     -- (3)
4. 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7    -- (4)

Now, we have four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d. But since a, b, c, d are digits (0-9, except a which is 1-9), we can find their values.

But it's a system of congruences. Let's see if we can solve this system.

Let me note the equations again:

Equation (1): 2b +3c +d =1 mod7

Equation (2):6a +3c +d =5 mod7

Equation (3):6a +2b +d =4 mod7

Equation (4):6a +2b +3c =6 mod7

Let me try to subtract equations to eliminate variables.

First, let's subtract Equation (3) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) =5 -4 mod7

Simplify:

6a -6a +3c -2b +d -d ≡1 mod7.

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation (5).

Similarly, let's subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (3):

(6a +2b +3c) - (6a +2b +d) =6 -4 mod7

Simplify:

6a -6a +2b -2b +3c -d ≡2 mod7.

So, 3c -d ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation (6).

Now, Equation (6): 3c -d ≡2 mod7 → d ≡3c -2 mod7.

From Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Substitute d from Equation (6):

2b +3c + (3c -2) ≡1 mod7 → 2b +6c -2 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify: 2b +6c ≡3 mod7.

We can factor 2b +6c as 2(b +3c) → 2(b +3c)≡3 mod7.

Similarly, Equation (5): 3c -2b ≡1 mod7 → 3c -2b =1 mod7.

Let me write Equation (5) as: 3c -2b =1 mod7.

And we have 2(b +3c) =3 mod7.

Let me denote x = b +3c.

Then, 2x ≡3 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, the inverse is 4.

So, x ≡3*4=12≡5 mod7.

Thus, x ≡5 mod7 → b +3c ≡5 mod7.

So, Equation (5a): b +3c ≡5 mod7.

Equation (5):3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

So, from Equation (5a): b =5 -3c mod7.

Substitute into Equation (5):

3c -2*(5 -3c) ≡1 mod7.

Compute:

3c -10 +6c ≡1 mod7.

Combine like terms: 9c -10 ≡1 mod7.

But 9 mod7=2, so 2c -10 ≡1 mod7.

-10 mod7: 7*1=7, 10-7=3, so -10≡-3≡4 mod7.

So, 2c +4 ≡1 mod7 →2c ≡1 -4 =-3≡4 mod7.

So, 2c ≡4 mod7 → c ≡2 mod7 (since 2*2=4 mod7).

So c ≡2 mod7. Since c is a digit (0-9), possible values for c are 2,9.

Wait, 2 +7=9, so c can be 2 or 9.

Now, let's consider these two cases: c=2 and c=9.

Case 1: c=2.

From Equation (5a): b +3c ≡5 mod7 → b +6 ≡5 mod7 → b ≡5 -6= -1≡6 mod7.

So b≡6 mod7. Since b is a digit (0-9), possible b=6 or 13, but 13 is invalid, so b=6.

So, c=2, b=6.

From Equation (6): d=3c -2 mod7 → d=6 -2=4 mod7.

So, d≡4 mod7. So possible d=4,11. But d is a digit, 0-9, so d=4 or 11 invalid, so d=4.

So, in this case, c=2, b=6, d=4.

Now, let's see what we have so far.

From Equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 →6a +6 +4 ≡5 mod7.

Compute 6a +10 ≡5 mod7.

10 mod7=3, so 6a +3 ≡5 mod7 →6a ≡2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, inverse is 6.

So a ≡2*6=12≡5 mod7.

Thus, a≡5 mod7. Since a is a digit (1-9), possible a=5,12,19,… but 12 is invalid, so a=5.

So, a=5.

Thus, in Case 1, a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4.

So N=5 6 2 4=5624.

Wait, but we need to check if this is the maximum N. Because we might have a higher N if c=9.

So let's check Case 2: c=9.

Case 2: c=9.

From Equation (5a): b +3c ≡5 mod7 →b +27≡5 mod7.

27 mod7: 7*3=21, 27-21=6, so 27≡6 mod7.

Thus, b +6 ≡5 mod7 →b≡5-6= -1≡6 mod7.

So, b≡6 mod7. So, b=6 or 13. But since b is a digit, b=6.

From Equation (6): d=3c -2 mod7 →3*9=27≡6 mod7. So, d≡6 -2=4 mod7.

Thus, d=4 or 11, but d is a digit, so d=4.

So, in this case, c=9, b=6, d=4.

Now, from Equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 →6a +27 +4 ≡5 mod7.

Compute 6a +31 mod7.

31 mod7: 7*4=28, 31-28=3 →31≡3 mod7.

So, 6a +3 ≡5 mod7 →6a ≡2 mod7.

As before, 6 inverse is 6, so a≡2*6=12≡5 mod7.

Thus, a=5 or 12, but a is a digit, so a=5.

So, in this case, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

So N=5 6 9 4=5694.

Wait, that's higher than 5624. So, which one is the correct N?

Wait, but let's see if both satisfy all the conditions.

Wait, but let's verify if N=5694 satisfies the original condition: changing any single digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7.

So, let's compute N1, N2, N3, N4 for N=5694.

Compute each:

1. N1: Change thousands digit to 1: 1 6 9 4 =1694.

Check if 1694 is divisible by7.

Compute 1694 /7: 7*242=1694, so yes, 1694 is divisible by7.

2. N2: Change hundreds digit to1: 5 1 9 4=5194.

Check 5194/7: 7*742=5194, yes.

3. N3: Change tens digit to1:5 6 1 4=5614.

Check 5614/7: 7*802=5614, yes.

4. N4: Change units digit to1:5 6 9 1=5691.

Check 5691/7: 7*813=5691, yes.

So, N=5694 seems to satisfy all four conditions.

But let's also check N=5624 to make sure.

1. N1:1 6 2 4=1624. 1624/7=232, which is exact. So, yes.

2. N2:5 1 2 4=5124. 5124 /7=732, exact.

3. N3:5 6 1 4=5614. As before, 5614/7=802, exact.

4. N4:5 6 2 1=5621. 5621/7: 7*803=5621, yes.

So both N=5624 and N=5694 satisfy the conditions. But since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, 5694 is larger, so we take N=5694.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again because maybe 5694 is not the maximum. Because when we set c=9, we got a=5, which is lower than 9. But if N=5694 is the maximum, but perhaps there is a higher N where a is higher, but the digits b, c, d are set to satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but according to our case analysis, when c=2, N=5624, and when c=9, N=5694. Since 5694 is larger, and both satisfy the conditions, N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let me make sure that there's no higher N than 5694. Because 569
