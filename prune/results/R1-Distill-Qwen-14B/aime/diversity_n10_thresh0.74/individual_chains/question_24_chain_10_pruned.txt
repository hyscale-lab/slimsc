Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. I'm going to try to understand each condition and see how they fit together.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever list we come up with must add up to 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list, and no other number shares this highest frequency. So 9 has to appear at least twice, maybe more, but all other numbers can appear at most once less than 9's count.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, so the median is a number that isn't in the list. Let me recall, the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear, so it's a whole number but not in the list.

Wait, but if the median is an average of two numbers, then for an even-length list, the median could be a non-integer, like 3.5. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear. So that suggests that the list has an odd number of elements because if it were even, the median could be a fractional value, but here it's an integer, so maybe the list has an odd number of elements.

Let me think. If the list has an odd length, say 2k+1 elements, then the median is the (k+1)th element. So in this case, that element is an integer, and it's not present in the list. So the median must be a number that's not in the list, but it's the middle value.

Wait, but if the median is the middle number and it's not in the list, that means the two middle numbers average to a number that's not in the list. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

If the list has an even number of elements, say 2k elements, then the median is the average of the kth and (k+1)th elements. For it to be an integer and not in the list, the average of two integers must be an integer, meaning the two middle numbers must sum to an even number. So their average is an integer, but that integer is not present in the list.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, 2k+1, then the median is the (k+1)th element, which is an integer. But in that case, since it's the middle element, that element must be present in
