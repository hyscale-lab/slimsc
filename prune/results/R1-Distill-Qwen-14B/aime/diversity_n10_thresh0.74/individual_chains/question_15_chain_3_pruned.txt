Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. The catch is that these paths can only change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, I know that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. So without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for either direction. That would be C(16,8), which is 12870. But that's without considering the direction changes.

Wait, the problem says the paths change direction exactly four times. So, each path must alternate between moving right and up, but only four times in total. Hmm, let's think about what a direction change means. Every time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for a path with exactly four direction changes, how many segments does it consist of?

If a path changes direction four times, it must have five segments. Because each direction change adds a new segment. For example, starting with a right move, then changing to up, that's two segments. So four changes mean five segments in total. So, the path is composed of five straight lines, alternating directions each time.

Now, each of these segments must consist of moving either right or up, but the direction alternates. So, the path could start with right, then up, then right, then up, etc. Or it could start with up, then right, then up, and so on. So, there are two possibilities for the starting direction.

Wait, but does the starting direction matter? Because the grid is square, maybe not. But perhaps I should consider both cases.

Each path is made up of five segments, each either horizontal or vertical. Since the path starts at the lower left and ends at the upper right, the number of right moves must equal the number of up moves. Let me see: each segment is a consecutive series of right or up moves. So, for an 8x8 grid, the total right steps are 8, and the total up steps are 8.

But since the path is divided into five segments, with alternating directions, each segment is either right or up. Let's say the path starts with right. Then the sequence is right, up, right, up, right. But wait, that's five segments. So, the number of right segments is three, and the number of up segments is two? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no. If the path starts with right, then the sequence is right, up, right, up, right. So, for five segments, starting with right, the number of right segments is three and up segments is two. Alternatively, if it starts with up, then the sequence is up, right, up, right, up, which would be three up segments and two right segments.

But in that case, the total steps in each direction would have to add up to 8. So, for the right segments, if there are three in number,
