Okay, so I have this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which contains numbers from 1 to 10. So, S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. 

She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. And she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both A and B happening, and P(B) is the probability of B.

In this case, event A is her winning the grand prize, and event B is her winning a prize. So, to find P(A|B), we need to compute the probability that she wins the grand prize (which automatically means she has at least two numbers matching) divided by the probability that she wins a prize (which is having at least two numbers matching).

Wait, but if she wins the grand prize, she must have all four numbers matching, which is a subset of having at least two numbers matching. So, the intersection of A and B is just A, because if she wins the grand prize, she definitely has at least two numbers matching. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A).

So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

Now, let me figure out what P(A) and P(B) are.

First, let's compute the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination C(10,4). Let me calculate that.

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, the total number of possible 4-number combinations is 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that Jen's 4 numbers are exactly the ones chosen. Since there is only one way this can happen (the exact combination she picked), P(A) is 1/C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, let's compute P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize, which is having at least two of her numbers in the randomly chosen set.

Calculating probabilities for at least two matches can sometimes be tricky. I think it's easier to compute the probability of the complementary event (i.e., having fewer than two matches) and subtract it from 1.

So, the complementary event is having 0 or 1 matches.

Let me compute the number of ways she can have 0 matches and 1 match.

First, the number of ways she has 0 matches. That would be choosing all 4 numbers from the 6 numbers she didn't pick. Because she picked 4 numbers, so there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't pick. 

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). Let me compute that.

C(6,4) = 15.

So, 15 ways to have 0 matches.

Next, the number of ways she has exactly 1 match. That means 1 number from her 4 chosen and 3 from the remaining 6.

So, the number of ways is C(4,1)*C(6,3). Let me compute that.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20 = 80.

So, 80 ways to have exactly 1 match.

Therefore, the total number of ways she doesn't win a prize (i.e., 0 or 1 matches) is 15 + 80 = 95.

Since the total number of possible combinations is 210, the number of ways she does win a prize (i.e., at least 2 matches) is 210 - 95 = 115.

Wait, wait, let me check that again. Because 95 is the number of losing combinations, so the winning combinations are total minus losing, which is 210 - 95 = 115. So, P(B) is 115/210. 

Wait, is 115 correct? Let me double-check the calculations for 0 and 1 matches.

For 0 matches: C(6,4) = 15. That makes sense.

For 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80. That seems right.

So, 15+80=95. 210-95=115. So, yes, 115 winning combinations for at least two matches.

Therefore, P(B) is 115/210. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

Wait, 23 is a prime number, so 23 and 42 share no common factors. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on, 115 divided by 210: 115 is 23*5, 210 is 42*5, so yes, 23/42.

Now, P(A) is 1/210.

So, P(A|B) is (1/210) divided by (115/210). The 210s cancel out, so it's 1/115.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 1/115 is a very small probability, but intuitively, if you have at least two matches, the probability that all four match should be higher.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because the number of ways to have exactly four matches is 1, and the number of ways to have at least two matches is 115. So, the probability is 1/115. But that seems really low. Did I compute the number of winning combinations correctly?

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe I should compute P(B) as the sum of probabilities for exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four matches.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the number of ways she can have at least two matches.

Let me calculate it again.

Number of ways to have exactly k matches is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k) for k=0,1,2,3,4.

So, for exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90.

Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24.

Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1.

So, total number of winning combinations is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, that's correct.

Therefore, P(B) is 115/210 = 23/42.

So, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, so the probability is 1/115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? 115 factors into 5*23. 1 is coprime with everything. So, m=1, n=115, m+n=116.

But wait, my intuition says this seems low. Let me think again. So, the probability that she has exactly four matches given that she has at least two is 1/115? Hmm.

Wait, but let's think of it as the number of favorable cases over the number of possible cases given the condition. So, the number of favorable cases for the grand prize is 1 (as only one specific combination). The number of cases where she has at least two matches is 115. So, 1/115 makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as:

Number of ways to have exactly four matches: 1.

Number of ways to have exactly three matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 24.

Number of ways to have exactly two matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 90.

So, the total number of ways she wins a prize is 1 + 24 + 90 = 115.

So, the probability of grand prize given that she won a prize is 1 / 115.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscounting the number of ways. Let me verify.

When she picks 4 numbers, the lottery picks 4 numbers. So, the number of possible 4-number sets is 210.

The number of ways that she and the lottery share exactly k numbers is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k).

So, for k=0: C(4,0)*C(6,4)=1*15=15.

k=1: C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80.

k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90.

k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

Total is 15+80+90+24+1=210, which matches the total number of possible combinations. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the number of ways to have at least two matches is 90 +24 +1=115.

So, the number of favorable cases is 1 (for grand prize), and the total cases given that she has a prize is 115.

So, the probability is 1/115.

Wait, 1 and 115 are coprime, so m=1, n=115, m+n=116.

But wait, I feel like maybe I should have done it differently. Let me check again.

Another way: Think of P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B). We have P(A) = 1/210.

P(B) is the probability of at least two matches. Which we can compute as 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

P(0 matches) = C(6,4)/C(10,4) = 15/210.

P(1 match) = [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4) = (4*20)/210 = 80/210.

So, P(B) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 -95)/210 = 115/210 = 23/42.

So, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Yes, same as before. So, 1/115 is correct.

Therefore, m=1, n=115, which are coprime. So, m + n = 116.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 115 is equal to 5*23, which are both primes, so 1 and 115 share no common factors besides 1.

Hence, the probability is 1/115, so m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

I think that's the answer. I don't see any errors in my reasoning now.


To determine the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, we use conditional probability. 

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

The probability of winning the grand prize (all four numbers matching) is:
\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

Next, calculate the probability of winning a prize (at least two numbers matching). We subtract the probabilities of having 0 or 1 matches from 1.

- Number of ways to have 0 matches: 
\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15
\]
- Number of ways to have 1 match:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Total losing combinations (0 or 1 matches):
\[
15 + 80 = 95
\]

Thus, the number of winning combinations (at least 2 matches):
\[
210 - 95 = 115
\]

The probability of winning a prize is:
\[
P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Since 1 and 115 are coprime, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 115\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 115 = 116\).

\boxed{116}
