Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and it's about finding the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a specific set. The set, called 𝓑, consists of boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better. Each box in 𝓑 has surface area 54 and volume 23. The sphere must be able to contain any such box, so I need to find the minimal sphere that can enclose any box from this set. The radius of this sphere will depend on the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to any corner of the box. Since the sphere must contain all boxes, I think I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal of such boxes, and then the radius would be half of that, right? Because the sphere's diameter would equal the space diagonal.

So, the space diagonal of a rectangular box with sides a, b, c is given by sqrt(a² + b² + c²). The sphere's radius squared would then be (a² + b² + c²)/4. So, if I can find the maximum possible value of a² + b² + c² given the constraints on surface area and volume, that should give me the maximum space diagonal squared, and then I can compute r squared.

Let me write down the given constraints mathematically. Surface area S is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54. Volume V is abc = 23.

My goal is to maximize a² + b² + c² given these constraints. This sounds like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some method involving substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities might help. Let me think.

First, let me denote the variables:
Let a, b, c be the lengths of the sides of the box, all positive real numbers.

Given:
1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 ⇒ ab + bc + ac = 27.
2. abc = 23.

We need to maximize a² + b² + c².

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac is 27, this means (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 54. So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 54.

Therefore, to maximize a² + b² + c², I need to maximize (a + b + c)^2. So, if I can find the maximum possible value of (a + b + c), then I can get the maximum a² + b² + c².

Wait, but is that correct? Because if a + b + c is maximum, then (a + b + c)^2 is maximum, which would make a² + b² + c² maximum. So yes, that seems right.

So
