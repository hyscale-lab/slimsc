Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The points O, A, and B are given as O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway to (1,0), and B is on the y-axis at a height of sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. 

The family of segments F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1. 

Since PQ is a unit segment, by the distance formula, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Squaring both sides, p^2 + q^2 = 1. So for all such segments, the coordinates of P and Q must satisfy this equation. 

Now, the problem mentions that there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, C is a point on AB that is not covered by any other PQ segment in F. We need to find OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. AB is a line segment connecting A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So AB is a straight line in the first quadrant. The family of segments PQ are all unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line from some (p, 0) to (0, q) where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, each PQ is a line segment in the first quadrant, starting on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis, with length 1. Since O is at (0,0), OA is half the unit segment along the x-axis, and OB is a segment along the y-axis which is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866.

Wait, OA is from (0,0) to (1/2, 0), so it's half a unit long. Similarly, OB is from (0,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.866. Hmm, so AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of line AB.

The coordinates are A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me check that. At x=1/2, y should be 0. So plugging in x=1/2, y = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + sqrt(3)/2 = -sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 = 0. Correct. And at x=0, y = sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. So the equation is correct.

So, the line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the point C is on AB such that it is not on any other segment from the family F except AB. So, AB is one of the PQ segments. Let me see: since AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), its length should be 1, as per the family F. Let me check the length of AB. Using the distance formula: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4 ) = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a member of F.

So, AB is one of these unit segments. The other segments in F are from varying points P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, for example, if p=1, q=0, but that's just the point (1,0), but that would not be a segment since q=0. Similarly, p=0, q=1 is the point (0,1). So, all the segments PQ are kind of parameterized by the angle they make with the axes.

Wait, actually, because p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 =1, the points P and Q lie on the unit circle. So, each PQ is a chord of the unit circle from (p,0) to (0,q), but since p and q are positive, they lie in the first quadrant.

Wait, no, because for each PQ, P is on the x-axis, so P is (p, 0), and Q is on the y-axis, (0, q). So, each PQ is a line segment connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant, and the length is 1.

So, the family F is all such PQs. So, AB is one of them. But the problem states that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F. So, for all other PQ in F, except AB, C is not on them.

So, the idea is that C is a point on AB that is not on any other PQ except AB. So, we need to find such a point C.

Hmm, how to approach this. Maybe we can parametrize point C on AB and find conditions under which no other PQ in F passes through C.

So, let me parametrize AB. Since AB goes from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), we can write any point on AB as a linear combination. Let me use a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, it's point A, t=1, it's point B.

So, the parametric equations for AB would be:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

So, x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

Alternatively, for some parameter t between 0 and 1.

Alternatively, maybe using another parameter. Let me see.

But perhaps a better approach is to parametrize point C as (x, y) on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, for any point C(x, y) on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2
