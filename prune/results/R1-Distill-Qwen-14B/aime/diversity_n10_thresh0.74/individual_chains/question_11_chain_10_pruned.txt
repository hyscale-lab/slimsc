Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this.

First off, I know that z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. So, z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That makes sense because the magnitude is 4, so in polar form, it's just 4 times e raised to iθ.

But wait, maybe working with rectangular form would be easier here? I'm not sure yet. Let me think. The expression involves both z and 1/z. Since |z| = 4, then |1/z| = 1/4. So, 1/z is just (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because the magnitude becomes reciprocal and the argument becomes negative.

So, maybe it's better to write z in terms of its real and imaginary parts, but perhaps using polar form could simplify things. Let me try that.

Let me represent z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, substituting these into the expression:

Expression = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately. First, compute (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Multiplying 4 into the complex number: 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i. So, that term becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Similarly, the second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) = 24 + 36i. So, that term becomes (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me recall that for a complex number a + ib, the real part is a. So, I need to compute Re[(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}].

Alternatively, maybe I can write each term as a complex number multiplied by e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}, then use Euler's formula to expand them.

Euler's formula says that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let me expand each term:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
But i^2 = -1, so that becomes 300 cosθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
Again, i^2 = -1, so that becomes 24 cosθ + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) + 36 sinθ.

Now, combining both terms:

First term: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)
Second term: (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)

Adding them together:

Real parts:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But wait, the problem asks for the real part, so I can ignore the imaginary parts. So, the expression's real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, we have Re(expression) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies. So, it's a function of θ: f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. I need to find the maximum of f(θ).

I remember that for functions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, the maximum is sqrt(A² + B²). But wait, in our case, it's 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, so it's like A cosθ + B sinθ where A=324 and B= -432.

Wait, but the formula for the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). So, in this case, sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300² is 90000, 24² is 576, and the cross term is 2*300*24=14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 +24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104976. So, 324²=104976.

Then, 432 squared: 400²=160000, 32²=1024, cross term 2*400*32=25600. So, (400 +32)^2=400² + 2*400*32 +32²=160000 +25600 +1024=160000+25600=185600 +1024=186624. So, 432²=186624.

So, sqrt(324² +432²)= sqrt(104976 + 186624)= sqrt(291600). What is sqrt(291600)? Well, 540²=291600 because 500²=250000, 40²=1600, and 540² = (500+40)^2=500² + 2*
