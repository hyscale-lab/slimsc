Okay, so I have this complex number problem here. It says: Find the largest possible real part of (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, I need to find the maximum real part of this expression. Let me try to break this down.

First, since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, that means z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. I remember that any complex number z can be written in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. So maybe I can express z that way. That might make things easier because multiplying and dividing by z could simplify with exponentials.

Let me write z = 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Because 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|², right? Since |z|=4, |z|² is 16, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So now, substituting z into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

I can factor out the 4: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}.

Similarly, the second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) * e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression becomes: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, okay. So now I have two terms with exponentials. Maybe I can combine them by expressing each of the coefficients (75 + 117i) and (24 + 36i) in polar form. Or perhaps there's another approach.

Wait, another thought. Since e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ} can be expressed in terms of cosθ and sinθ. Since e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So let me expand both terms.

First term: 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ).

Second term: (24 + 36i)*(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me compute each multiplication separately.

Starting with the first term:

4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ).

Let me first compute (75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ). Using distributive property:

75*cosθ + 75*i sinθ + 117i*cosθ + 117i^2 sinθ.

But i^2 is -1, so that last term becomes -117 sinθ.

So grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 75 cosθ - 117 sinθ.

Imaginary: 75 sinθ + 117 cosθ.

So (75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ) = (75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ).

Then multiply by 4:

Real part: 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: 4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ) = 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Okay, so the first term has real part 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ and imaginary part 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Now the second term: (24 + 36i)*(cosθ - i sinθ).

Again, using distributive property:

24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 is -1, so the last term becomes +36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary:

Real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

So (24 + 36i)*(cosθ - i sinθ) = (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i*(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

So the second term contributes a real part of 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ and an imaginary part of -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ.

Now, adding the two terms together (first term + second term):

Real parts: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So the entire expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 +144i)/z has a real part of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ and an imaginary part of 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on that: Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of Re, which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. So we need to maximize the expression A cosθ + B sinθ, where A = 324 and B = -432.

Wait, actually, it's A cosθ + B sinθ, but in this case, B is negative. So it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Wait, but the general method for finding the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is to write it as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²). Then the maximum value is C.

Wait, let me recall. The maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). Because you can write it as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A² + B²), and the maximum of that is R.

So, in this case, A is 324, B is -432.

So R = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.

First compute 324 squared. 324 is 18^2 * 1, since 18^2 is 324. Wait, no, 18^2 is 324. So 324^2 is (18^2)^2 = 18^4. Wait, that might not be helpful. Maybe better to compute directly.

324 * 324: Let's compute 300^2 = 90,000. Then 300*24*2 = 14,400. Then 24^2 = 576. So 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 90,000 +14,400=104,400; 104,400 +576=104,976. So 324² is 104,976.

Similarly, 432²: 400² = 160,000, 32² = 1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624.

So R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). What is sqrt(291,600)?

Well, 500² is 250,000. 540² is 291,600 because 54^2 = 2916, so 540² is 291,600. So R is 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of Re is 540.

So the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We can represent this as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324² + 432²). Wait, but since B is negative, it would be R cos(theta - phi), but the maximum is still R.

Alternatively, using the formula for the maximum of a linear combination of sine and cosine, the maximum is indeed sqrt(A² + B²). So that's 540.

So the answer should be 540.

Wait a second, but I want to make sure that when I converted z and 1/z, I did that correctly.

z = 4 e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}, correct. Then when I multiplied each term, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, let me re-examine the expansion of the first term:

(75 + 117i) * 4 e^{iθ}.

Yes, 4*(75 +117i) is 300 + 468i, then multiplied by e^{iθ}. Then I expanded (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Wait, no, I think I may have made a mistake here.

Wait, in the first term, I think I incorrectly expanded (75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ), multiplied by 4. But actually, the first term is 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}. So 4*(75 + 117i) is 300 + 468i, then multiplied by e^{iθ}.

So (300 + 468i)*(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468 i^2 sinθ.

Which is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ). So that part was correct.

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)*(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ -24 i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ.

Which is 24 cosθ +36 sinθ + i(-24 sinθ +36 cosθ). So that is correct.

Adding the real parts: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ + 24 cosθ +36 sinθ = (324 cosθ) + (-432 sinθ). Correct.

So the real part is indeed 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So that's correct.

So the maximum of that is 540. So I think I did it correctly.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), so \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\). Substituting these into the expression gives:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Simplifying each term:

1. First term: \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\).
2. Second term: \((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\).

Expanding using \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\):

- The first term becomes \(4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta))\).
- The second term becomes \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)\).

Combining real parts:

\[
\text{Re} = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

The maximum value of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Here, \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\), so:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
