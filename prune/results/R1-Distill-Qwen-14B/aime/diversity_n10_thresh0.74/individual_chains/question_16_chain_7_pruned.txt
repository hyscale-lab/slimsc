Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that primes play a significant role in modular arithmetic. Maybe I can use some properties of primes and exponents here. The problem is about divisibility, so perhaps I should consider congruences modulo p².

Let me think: If n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p², that means n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ is congruent to -1 modulo p squared. That implies that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p² because if I square both sides, (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² => n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p².

This suggests that the order of n modulo p² divides 8. Wait, the multiplicative order. So, the multiplicative order of n modulo p² is the smallest positive integer k such that nᵏ ≡ 1 mod p². Since n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p², the order must divide 8. So, possible orders are 1, 2, 4, or 8.

But n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², so the order can't be 1 or 2 because if the order were 1, n⁴ would be 1, not -1. If the order were 2, then n² ≡ 1 mod p², which would imply n⁴ ≡ 1 mod p², again contradicting n⁴ ≡ -1. So the order must be either 4 or 8.

If the order is 4, then 4 is the smallest exponent k where nᵏ ≡ 1 mod p². But wait, n⁴ ≡ -1, so n⁴ isn't 1, so the order can't be 4 either. Therefore, the order must be 8. That means 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group modulo p².

The multiplicative group modulo p², when p is an odd prime, has order p(p-1). So, for 8 to divide p(p-1), either p divides 8 or p-1 divides 8. Since p is prime, the only possibility is that p=2 or p-1 is a multiple of 8. Let's check p=2 first.

Wait, p=2: Let's see if there exists an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's test n=1: 1+1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1 =17, which is 1 mod 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. Hmm, seems like n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 would be 1 or 2 mod 4. So it can
