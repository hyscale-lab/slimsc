Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the value of xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem gives me two logarithmic equations that are both equal to 10. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

log_x(y^x) = 10

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. Maybe I can use that to rewrite these equations in exponential form. Let me try that.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. So, if I rewrite this, it becomes x^10 = y^x. That makes sense because the base is x, and the exponent is 10, so the result is y^x.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Rewriting this, it becomes y^10 = x^{4y}. Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find xy. So, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

Looking at equation 1: x^10 = y^x. Let me take the x-th root of both sides. That would give me x^(10/x) = y. So y = x^(10/x). That seems useful. Now I can substitute this into equation 2.

Equation 2 is y^10 = x^{4y}. Substituting y = x^(10/x), we get:

(y)^10 = [x^{10/x}]^10 = x^{(100/x)}.

On the right side of equation 2, it's x^{4y} = x^{4*(x^{10/x})}.

So now, equation 2 after substitution becomes:

x^{(100/x)} = x^{4*(x^{10/x})}.

Since the bases are the same (both are x), their exponents must be equal. Therefore:

100/x = 4*(x^{10/x}).

Let me write that down:

100/x = 4 * x^{10/x}.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let's divide both sides by 4 to make the numbers smaller:

25/x = x^{10/x}.

Now, I have:

25/x = x^{10/x}.

This seems like an equation where I can take logarithms on both sides to solve for x. Let me try that.

Taking natural log (ln) on both sides:

ln(25/x) = ln(x^{10/x}).

Using logarithm properties, ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b), and ln(a^b) = b*ln(a). So,

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Let me rewrite that:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10 ln x)/x.

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange terms to make it easier.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

ln(25) - ln(x) - (10 ln x)/x = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out ln x. Let me see:

ln(25) - ln(x)*(1 + 10/x) = 0.

Wait, that might not be the most helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of ln x.

Let me set t = ln x. Then, ln(25) is a constant, and ln(x) is t, so the equation becomes:

ln(25) - t = (10 t)/x.

But wait, x is e^t because t = ln x. So x = e^t, so 1/x = e^{-t}.

Substituting that in, the equation becomes:

ln(25) - t = 10 t * e^{-t}.

Hmm, so:

ln(25) = t + 10 t e^{-t}.

Wait, let me factor out t:

ln(25) = t (1 + 10 e^{-t}).

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a substitution or see if t has a particular value that satisfies this. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an intelligent guess for t. Let me consider that maybe t is a multiple of ln(5), since 25 is 5 squared.

Wait, 25 is 5^2, so ln(25) = 2 ln 5. So,
