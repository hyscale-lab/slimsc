Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. The question is about finding the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in a specific form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p where the distance is written as m√n / p.

First, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, the opposite edges are equal. So AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). That's interesting because it suggests some kind of symmetry in the tetrahedron. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I think those are called isosceles or maybe symmetrical tetrahedrons where opposite edges are equal. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron has some nice properties, like the incenter coinciding with other centers, perhaps.

So, the incenter is equidistant from all four faces, and that distance is what we're looking for. The formula I recall for the distance from the incenter to a face in a tetrahedron is similar to the 2D case with triangles, right? In a triangle, the inradius is the area divided by the semiperimeter. For a tetrahedron, I think it's the volume divided by something. Let me think. In 3D, the inradius (which is the distance from the incenter to each face) should be equal to 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. So, the formula is r = 3V / A, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and A is the total surface area.

So, to find r, I need to calculate the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A.

But wait, the surface area is the sum of the areas of all four faces. Since the tetrahedron is symmetrical (opposite edges equal), maybe all the faces are congruent triangles? Let's check.

Each face is a triangle. Let me check the edges of each face. Let's take face ABC: edges AB, BC, and AC. Given AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80). Similarly, face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD. BC is sqrt(89), CD is sqrt(41), BD is sqrt(80). So, yes, each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So all four faces are congruent triangles. That's helpful because it means each face has the same area, so the total surface area will be four times the area of one face.

So, if I can find the area of one face, multiply by four to get A, then find the volume V, then compute r = 3V / A.

So, let's start by calculating the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89). Let's compute its area using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c) / 2.

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

Wait, that might be a bit messy. Alternatively, since all the faces are congruent, perhaps I can find another way to compute the area, maybe using vectors or coordinates.

Another approach is to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system so that its vertices have coordinates that make the calculations easier. Since the opposite edges are equal, maybe I can position the tetrahedron such that the coordinates of the vertices are symmetric in some way.

I remember that for a symmetrical tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be embedded in a coordinate system where the vertices are at (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c) or something similar. Let me try that.

Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s say point A is at (x, y, z)
Point B is at (-x, -y, z)
Point C is at (-x, y, -z)
Point D is at (x, -y, -z)

This way, the coordinates are symmetric. Let's check the distances.

Compute AB: distance between A and B.

A = (x, y, z), B = (-x, -y, z)

AB^2 = (x + x)^2 + (y + y)^2 + (z - z)^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x² + 4y².

Given AB = sqrt(41), so AB² = 41 = 4x² + 4y² → x² + y² = 41/4.

Similarly, compute AC: distance between A and C.

A = (x, y, z), C = (-x, y, -z)

AC² = (x + x)^2 + (y - y)^2 + (z + z)^2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x² + 4z².

Given AC = sqrt(80) → AC² = 80 = 4x² + 4z² → x² + z² = 80/
