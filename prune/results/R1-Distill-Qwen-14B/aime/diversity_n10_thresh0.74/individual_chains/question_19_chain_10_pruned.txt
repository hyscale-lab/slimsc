Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out.

First, let's recall what the circumradius and inradius are. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. So R is 13, and r is 6 here.

The triangle has its circumcenter O and incenter I. The incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like an important condition. I'm not sure how that relates, but maybe I can use some properties or coordinate geometry.

Wait, maybe coordinate geometry might be a good approach here. Let's try setting up a coordinate system. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps I can place point I at the origin or something? Hmm, or maybe place O somewhere else. Wait, perhaps it's better to place O at the origin. Let me think.

If I set O at the origin (0,0), then point I would be somewhere in the plane. The vector OI would connect O to I, so if I is at (h,k), then the vector OI is (h,k). IA is perpendicular to OI, so the vector IA must be perpendicular to vector OI.

But wait, what is point A? If I is the incenter, it's inside the triangle. Maybe I can denote point A as some point (x,y). Then vector IA would be (x - h, y - k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero. So (x - h)*h + (y - k)*k = 0.

But this might get complicated. Maybe there's a better approach without coordinates.

Let me think about some triangle properties. The inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter: r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R is related to the sides by the formula R = (a b c) / (4 area), where a, b, c are the sides.

Wait, but the problem asks for AB multiplied by AC. Let's denote AB as c, AC as b, and BC as a. Then the product we're looking for is b * c.

So, if I can find expressions for b and c, or their product, using the given information, that would help.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, maybe we can use some properties involving Euler's formula or something else. Wait, Euler's formula relates the distance between the incenter and circumradius: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me compute that.

OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, okay, that's something. So the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). But how does that help with IA being perpendicular to OI?

Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI. So in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I. So triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at I. So by Pythagoras, OA² = OI² + IA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA². So 169 = 13 + IA², so IA² = 156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay. So the length of IA is 2√39.

Wait, IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A. I remember that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. Let me recall the formula.

The formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me confirm that. Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is r divided by sin of half angle A.

So IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). But earlier we found IA = 2√39. So,

6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39

So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = (3√39) / 39 = √39 / 13.

Wait, that's interesting. So sin(A/2) = √39 / 13. Let me compute cos(A/2) then, since sin²θ + cos²θ =1. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Hmm, now, since in triangle ABC, the sides can be related to the angles. Also, the inradius r = 6 is related to the area and semiperimeter.

Let me denote the semiperimeter as s = (a + b + c)/2.

The area Δ can be expressed as r*s =6s. Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius as Δ = (a b c) / (4R) = (a b c)/52.

So, 6s = (a b c)/52.

Hmm, so (a b c) = 312 s.

Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful.

Wait, but we need to find AB * AC, which is c * b.

Let me think about other relations. Maybe using the formula for IA again.

Wait, I recall that IA can also be expressed as sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). Let me verify that formula.

Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). So IA² = r² + (s - a)^2.

Earlier, we found IA² = 156. So,

156 = 6² + (s - a)^2 → 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 → (s - a)^2 =120 → s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Since s > a, it's positive.

So s - a = 2√30.

Hmm, okay. So s = a + 2√30.

But s is also (a + b + c)/2, so:

(a + b + c)/2 = a + 2√30 → (b + c)/2 = 2√30 → b + c =4√30.

So, we have that b + c =4√30.

Hmm, that's a useful relation. So the sum of sides AB and AC is 4√30.

But we need the product b*c.

Hmm, perhaps we can find another equation involving b and c.

Wait, let's recall that in triangle ABC, the Law of Cosines relates sides and angles
