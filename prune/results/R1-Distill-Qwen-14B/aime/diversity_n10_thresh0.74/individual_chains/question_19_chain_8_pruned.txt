Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let's see, it's about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me jot down what I know:

- Triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13.
- Inradius r = 6.
- IA ⊥ OI, which means that the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the segment OI.

I need to find AB·AC, which is the product of two sides of the triangle. I'm a bit rusty on some of the properties, but let's see what I can remember.

First, let me recall some standard properties and formulas related to triangle centers and inradius and circumradius.

The inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter (s) by the formula:

r = Δ / s

where Δ is the area of the triangle, and s = (a + b + c)/2.

The circumradius R is given by:

R = (a·b·c) / (4Δ)

So, if I can find the sides a, b, c, or some relations between them, maybe I can compute AB·AC. Alternatively, perhaps there are some relations involving OI and IA.

Wait, the problem mentions IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key piece of information. I need to find a relation that arises from IA ⊥ OI.

Let me think about the positions of O and I. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. In general, O and I are different points unless the triangle is equilateral.

But in this case, IA is perpendicular to OI. Maybe I can express this condition using coordinates or vector methods?

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry would help. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system in a way that simplifies the problem.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) because it's the incenter. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), O must lie somewhere on the line perpendicular to IA at I.

Wait, no. IA is a line from I to A, and OI is the line from I to O. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular.

Since I is at (0,0), let me denote vector IA as vector A, since I is the origin. Then O is some point (let's say vector O), and the dot product of vectors IA and OI must be zero.

Wait, OI is the vector from I to O, which is just vector O. IA is vector A. So the dot product of A and O must be zero. So, A · O = 0.

That's a helpful condition. So if I can model the coordinates such that I is at (0,0), and O is somewhere with coordinates (h, k), then point A is (a, b) such that a*h + b*k = 0.

But this might get complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps there's a formula that relates OI, the distance between the incenter and circumradius. I recall that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Yes, I think that's correct for any triangle. So, OI² = R(R - 2r).

Given R =13 and r=6, OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1=13. So OI=√13.

So OI is √13 units long.

But the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

So in triangle IOA, we can apply Pythagoras theorem:

OA² = OI² + IA²

But OA is the distance from the circumcenter to vertex A. Since O is the circumcenter, OA is just the circumradius R, which is 13.

So, 13² = (√13)² + IA².

So, 169 = 13 + IA².

Therefore, IA² = 169 -13 = 156. So IA=√156=2√39.

So the length of IA is 2√39.

But IA is the distance from the incenter I to vertex A. Wait, IA is the length of the angle bisector from A to the inradius? Or is there a formula for the length of IA?

I think the formula for the length from the incenter to a vertex can be
