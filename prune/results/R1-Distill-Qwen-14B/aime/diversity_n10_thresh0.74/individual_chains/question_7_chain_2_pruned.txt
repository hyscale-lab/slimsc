Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention the probability is m/n, and I need to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, a regular octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue with a 50-50 chance. So, each vertex has two possibilities, leading to a total of 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. 

The key here is that we can rotate the octagon, and we want all the blue vertices to move to positions that were previously red. So, after rotation, wherever there was a blue vertex, it should now be on a red vertex's original position.

Wait, but rotation is a symmetry operation. So, I think this is related to group theory, specifically Burnside's lemma or something like that. Burnside's lemma relates the number of colorings fixed by a group action to the average number of fixed points. But I'm not entirely sure how to apply it here.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a permutation problem. Each rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices. For a rotation by k positions, the permutation cycles are determined by the greatest common divisor of k and 8. For example, a rotation by 1 position would have 8 cycles of length 1 each? No, wait, no. Actually, for a rotation by k positions, the number of cycles is gcd(k,8). So, for example, a rotation by 2 positions, which is a quarter turn, would have gcd(2,8)=2 cycles, each of length 4. Hmm, maybe that's getting somewhere.

Wait, but how does this help me? I'm supposed to find colorings such that there exists a rotation which takes blue vertices to red positions. So, if I denote the original coloring as C, and the rotated coloring as R(C), then we need R(C) to have all blue vertices where C had red. Or, in other words, the set of blue vertices in C must map to the set of red vertices in C under some rotation.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me rephrase. The problem is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation such that when you apply that rotation to the oct
