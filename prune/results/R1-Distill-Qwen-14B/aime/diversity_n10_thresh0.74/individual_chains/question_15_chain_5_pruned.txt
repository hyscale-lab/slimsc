Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. Each step must move along the grid lines, so I assume that each move is either to the right or upwards. The catch is that the path should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right without any restrictions would require moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. The total number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But that's without any restrictions on direction changes.

Now, the problem adds a constraint: exactly four direction changes. So, I need to think about how direction changes occur in such paths. Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, and so on, each time it switches from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change.

Wait, so a path that changes direction exactly four times will have how many segments? Let's think. Each direction change is a switch between right and up. So, starting with either right or up, each direction change adds a new segment. So, if there are four direction changes, that would create five segments. For example, right, up, right, up, right. That's four direction changes, resulting in five segments.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, we have to make exactly 8 right moves and 8 up moves. So, if a path has five segments, that means it alternates between right and up five times, but I need to ensure that the total number of right and up steps each sum to eight.

So, let's model this. Suppose the path starts with a right move. Then the segments would be: R, U, R, U, R, etc., depending on the number of direction changes. Since we have four direction changes, the number of segments is five. So, the path alternates between R and U five times. Similarly, if it starts with U, it would alternate five times as well.

Wait, but whether it starts with R or U, the number of segments remains the same. So, in our case, the path will have five segments, each consisting of consecutive R or U moves. Now, the total number of R steps is 8 and U steps is 8. So, these have to be distributed among the five segments.

But here's the thing: the segments alternate between R and U. So, if the path starts with R, the segments will be R, U, R, U, R. Since there are five segments, three of them will be R and two will be U. Similarly, if it starts with U, the segments will be U, R, U, R, U, with three U and two R.

Wait, is that correct? Let me count: 5 segments, starting with R: positions 1,3,5 are R segments
