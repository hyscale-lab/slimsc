Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, the problem mentions points O, A, and B. Their coordinates are given as O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). 

Then, it defines a family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is a line segment of length 1, starting from some point P on the x-axis and ending at some point Q on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant. 

The problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. Then, we need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then compute p + q.

Alright, so I need to find point C on AB such that C is only on AB and not on any other segments from F. Then compute OC squared.

Let me try to visualize this. Points A and B are on the axes, so segment AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). That should form a straight line in the first quadrant. The family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, these are like line segments from (x,0) to (0,y) with x^2 + y^2 = 1, because the distance between (x,0) and (0,y) is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1, so x^2 + y^2 = 1.

So, each segment PQ in F is a line from (x,0) to (0,y) where x and y satisfy x^2 + y^2 = 1. These are all the possible segments of length 1 in the first quadrant connecting the axes.

Now, point C is on AB, not at A or B, and it's the only point on AB that isn't covered by any other segment in F. So, C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of these segments, or perhaps the point where AB is the limit of these segments.

Hmm, I think the segments PQ form a sort of envelope, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C. So, point C is the point of tangency where AB just touches one of these segments, and all other segments either lie on one side or another, so C isn't on any other segment from F except AB.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the family F and find where AB intersects these segments, and then find the point C where AB is the only segment that passes through it.

Let me think about parametrizing the segments PQ.

Each segment PQ can be represented parametrically. Let me denote P as (x, 0) and Q as (0, y), with x^2 + y^2 = 1.

So, the equation of the line PQ can be written as:

(y) / (x) = (y - 0)/(0 - x) = -y/x.

Wait, no. Actually, when you have two points, (x, 0) and (0, y), the equation of the line connecting them is (x-intercept form): x/(x) + y/(y) = 1, but that's just 1=1, which isn't helpful. Wait, actually, the equation is x/(a) + y/(b) = 1, where a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept. So here, a = x and b = y. So the equation is x/x + y/y = 1, which simplifies to 1 + 1 = 1, which is not correct. Wait, no, actually, the intercept form is (x/a) + (y/b) = 1. So, substituting a = x and b = y, the equation is (X/x) + (Y/y) = 1, where X and Y are variables.

So, equation of PQ is (X/x) + (Y/y) = 1, with x^2 + y^2 = 1.

So, any point (X,Y) on PQ satisfies (X/x) + (Y/y) = 1.

Now, AB is the line segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2).
