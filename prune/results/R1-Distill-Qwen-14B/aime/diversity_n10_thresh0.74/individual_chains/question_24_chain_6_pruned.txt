Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in a list. Let me try to break down the problem step by step. 

The problem states that the list of positive integers has three properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

Hmm, okay. Let's go through each of these properties one by one and see what they mean for the list.

First, the sum is 30. That means all the numbers in the list add up to 30. So if I have n numbers in the list, their total is 30. 

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 must appear more times than any other number, and no other number can have the same count as 9. That tells me that 9 has to occur at least twice, but since it's the mode, it has to occur more times than any other number. So the other numbers can appear at most once, unless they appear the same number of times as 9, but since it's a unique mode, others can't match.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So the median is a number that's in the middle of the sorted list, but it's not one of the actual elements in the list. That's interesting. So the median is some integer, say M, which is not present in the list, but it's the middle value when the numbers are ordered.

Let me think about how the median works. For a list with an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number. For an even number, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But since the median is a positive integer and doesn't appear in the list, this might imply that the list has an even number of elements because the median is the average of two middle numbers. Because if the list had an odd number of elements, the median would be one of the elements, which can't be the case here. Let me confirm that.

Suppose the list has an odd number of elements, say 2k+1. Then the median is the (k+1)th element when sorted. Since the median is not in the list, that's impossible because the (k+1)th element is part of the list. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements, say 2k. Then the median is the average of the kth and (k+1)th elements. So the median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2. Since the median is an integer not in the list, (a_k + a_{k+1}) must be even, so their sum is even, meaning both are even or both are odd. But since the median isn't in the list, it's not equal to a_k or a_{k+1}.

Alright, so the list has an even number of elements. Let's denote the number of elements as 2k. Hmm, but we don't know the exact number yet. Maybe figuring that out will help.

Let me think about the mode first. Since 9 is the mode and appears more than any other number, the count of 9s must be at least two. Let's say it appears m times, where m is at least 2, and m is greater than the count of any other number.

Also, since the sum is 30, and the numbers are positive integers, each number is at least 1. So, for the list, the sum is 30, and 9 is the mode.

I should probably try to construct such a list step by step.

Let me consider possible lengths of the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements. Since the median is not in the list, n must be even.

Let me think about the possible minimal number of elements. Let's say n=2: the median would be the average of the two elements. But to have a mode, both elements would have to be the same, which would be 15 each, but then sum would be 30. But 15 would be the mode, but 15 doesn't appear more than once, so no mode. So n=2 is impossible.

n=4: Let's see. The median would be the average of the second and third elements. These two elements must add up to an even number, so their average is integer. Also, 9 must be the mode. So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

So, in a list of four numbers, to have a unique mode, 9 must appear at least twice. Other numbers can appear at most once.

So possible list: [9,9, a, b], where a and b are distinct from each other and from 9. But wait, but in a sorted list, the two middle numbers are the second and third. Their average is the median, which is an integer not in the list.

So, sorted list: [a, 9, 9, b]. So, the median is (9 + a)/2 if a <9 and (9 + b)/2 if b >9. Hmm, but a and b can't be 9 because 9 is already in the list, but wait, the median is an integer not in the list.

Wait, let me think again. Let me consider the sorted list. Let's arrange the four numbers in order. Let's say the two 9s are in positions 2 and 3. So the list would be [x, 9, 9, y], where x <=9 and y >=9.

The median is (9 + 9)/2 = 9. But 9 is in the list, so that can't be. So the median can't be 9 because the median is not in the list. Therefore, the two middle numbers can't both be 9. So perhaps one of them is less than 9 and the other is more than 9.

Wait, but if the list is [a, b, c, d], sorted in non-decreasing order.

The median is (b + c)/2.

If 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice.

Case 1: 9 appears exactly twice.

So, two of the numbers are 9. Let's place them in the list. Let me say a <= b <= c <= d.

If 9 is in positions 1 and 2: [9,9,c,d]. Then b=9, c could be >=9
