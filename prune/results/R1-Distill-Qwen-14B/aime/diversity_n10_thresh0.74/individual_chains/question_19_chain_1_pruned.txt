Okay, so I have this problem about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. They tell me that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB times AC. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, so that's the radius of the circumscribed circle around ABC. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

They also mention that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key piece of information. Maybe I can use coordinates or some vector methods? Or perhaps there's a specific formula or theorem related to this condition.

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram. Since I can't actually draw it, I'll visualize it. Triangle ABC with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I.

I remember that in any triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter: r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R is related to the sides and the area: R = (a*b*c)/(4*area), where a, b, c are the sides.

But I need AB * AC. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. So, I need to find b * c. Maybe I can express this in terms of other variables?

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system to simplify things.

Let me set point I at the origin (0,0) because it's the incenter. Then, point A is somewhere on the plane, and O is another point such that IA is perpendicular to OI. Since I is at (0,0), IA is the vector from I to A, which is just the coordinates of A. OI is the vector from I to O, which is the coordinates of O. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero.

So, if I let A = (x, y), then O = (h, k). The vectors IA = (x, y) and OI = (h, k) must satisfy x*h + y*k = 0 because the dot product is zero.

But wait, I is the incenter, so it's located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. Maybe this coordinate approach is getting too complicated. Is there a better way?

I recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI^2 = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me calculate OI using this.

Given R = 13, r = 6.

So, OI^2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*1 =13.

So, OI = sqrt(13).

That's interesting. So the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at I.

So, in triangle OIA, by the Pythagorean theorem:

OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2.

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So,

13^2 = (sqrt(13))^2 + IA^2.

Calculating,

169 = 13 + IA^2.

So, IA^2 = 169 -13 = 156.

Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).

So, IA = 2*sqrt(39).

But IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I remember that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and inradius.

Wait, the formula for IA is something like IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me confirm that.

Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).

But earlier, I found IA = 2*sqrt(39). So,

6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39).

Solving for sin(A/2):

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39).

Simplify sqrt(39): sqrt(39) is as it is, so sin(A/2) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39
