Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, let me write down what I know. The problem gives me two logarithmic equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can use some logarithm properties to simplify these expressions. Let's take the first equation.

For the first equation, log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a), I can rewrite the left side as x * log_x(y). So, that becomes:

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Hmm, okay, so that's equation (1). Now, log_x(y) is the exponent to which I must raise x to get y. So, log_x(y) = k implies that x^k = y. Maybe I can express y in terms of x here.

Let me let log_x(y) = k. Then, from the equation, x * k = 10. So, equation (1) becomes x * k = 10, and since y = x^k, I can write y as x^k.

So, y = x^k, and x * k = 10. Maybe I can solve for k in terms of x or vice versa.

Wait, maybe it's better to switch to natural logarithms or common logarithms to make this easier. Let me recall that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). So, log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x). So, equation (1) can be written as:

x * (ln(y)/ln(x)) = 10.

Similarly, equation (2) is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same power rule, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Again, log_y(x) is ln(x)/ln(y). So, equation (2) becomes:

4y * (ln(x)/ln(y)) = 10.

Hmm, so now I have two equations:

1. x * (ln(y)/ln(x)) = 10
2. 4y * (ln(x)/ln(y)) = 10

Wait, these look like they could be related. Let me denote A = ln(x) and B = ln(y). Then, equation (1) becomes x*(B/A) = 10, and equation (2) becomes 4y*(A/B) = 10.

So, equation (1): xB/A = 10
Equation (2): 4yA/B = 10

Hmm, maybe I can substitute one into the other. Let me look for a relationship between x and y.

Since I have y expressed in terms of x from equation (1
