Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's the problem.

First, I should understand what the problem is asking. We're dealing with three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, and there's another equation involving their squares and products. So, it's a system of equations with two constraints.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both.

Looking at the second equation, it's symmetric in a, b, c, right? Because each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another variable. So, maybe there's a way to factor or rewrite this expression to make it more manageable.

Let me try to factor the second equation. Let's see: a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c can be factored as b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So, the entire second equation can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as 300 - a, (a + c) as 300 - b, and (a + b) as 300 - c. Let me substitute these into the equation.

So, substituting, the equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, for b and c.

So, the equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's another form. I wonder if I can relate this to known identities or if I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)².

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of S = a + b + c and P = ab + bc + ca.

Given that S = 300, then:

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P = 300² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

So, substituting back into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) = 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 27,000,000 - 600P.

And then the equation is:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, substituting,

27,000,000 - 600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Rearranging,

(a³ + b³ + c³) = 27,000,000 - 600P - 6,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

(a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000 - 600P.

Hmm, so now I have (a³ + b³ + c³) in terms of P.

I wonder if there's another identity involving a³ + b³ + c³. I recall that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, that's another way to express it.

Let me write that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S P + 3abc.

Given S = 300, so S³ = 27,000,000.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 3*300*P + 3abc = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.

But earlier, we have:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600P.

So, setting them equal:

27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc = 21,000,000 - 600P.

Let me subtract 21,000,000 from both sides:

6,000,000 - 900P + 3abc = -600P.

Now, bring all terms to one side:

6,000,000 - 900P + 3abc + 600P = 0.

Simplify the P terms:

6,000,000 - 300P + 3abc = 0.

Let me write this as:

3abc = 300P - 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, now I have this relationship between abc and P.

Let me remember that P is ab + bc + ca.

So, now we have two equations:

1. S = a + b + c = 300.

2. abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Which can be written as abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, that's interesting. So, perhaps I can let x = a, y = b, z = c, and consider the equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a cubic equation.

Wait, another approach: Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of the number of solutions, but the second equation complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some substitution or variable change.

Wait, let me think: Let me define t = ab + bc + ca = P.

So, from the equation, abc = 100t - 2,000,000.

So, abc = 100t - 2,000,000.

But in terms of symmetric polynomials, the elementary symmetric functions are S = a + b + c = 300, t = ab + bc + ca, and u = abc.

So, in this case, u = 100t - 2,000,000.

So, we have u = 100t - 2,000,000.

So, now, if I can find t, then I can find u.

But how?

Wait, maybe I can find t.

Let me think: We know that S = 300, t
