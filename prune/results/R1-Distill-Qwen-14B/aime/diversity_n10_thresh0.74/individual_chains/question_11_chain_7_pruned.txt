Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions like this, it's often useful to express z in polar form. Since the modulus of z is given as 4, I can write z as 4 times e^(iθ), where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier to handle because multiplying and dividing complex numbers in polar form is straightforward.

So, let me write z = 4e^(iθ). Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^(-iθ), right? Because 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z| squared, but since |z| is 4, |z| squared is 16, so 1/z = (conj(z))/16. But since z is 4e^(iθ), conj(z) is 4e^(-iθ), so 1/z is e^(-iθ)/4. Got that.

So now, let me substitute z into the expression. The expression becomes:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^(iθ) + (96 + 144i) * (e^(-iθ)/4)

Let me compute each part separately.

First, compute (75 + 117i) * 4e^(iθ):

75 times 4 is 300, and 117 times 4 is 468. So that term becomes (300 + 468i) e^(iθ).

Next, compute (96 + 144i) * (e^(-iθ)/4):

96 divided by 4 is 24, and 144 divided by 4 is 36. So that term becomes (24 + 36i) e^(-iθ).

So now, the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^(iθ) + (24 + 36i)e^(-iθ). 

Hmm, I need to find the real part of this expression because the problem asks for the largest possible real part. So, let me write e^(iθ) and e^(-iθ) in terms of cosθ and sinθ.

I know that e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^(-iθ) = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let me substitute those in.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Let me compute each part.

Starting with the first term:

Multiply (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ):
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + i (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) - 468 sinθ
Because i^2 is -1.

So combining the real parts: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ)
And the imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

Now, the second term:

Multiply (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ):
= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ - i (24 sinθ - 36 cosθ) + 36 sinθ
Again, because i^2 is -1, so -36i^2 sinθ is +36 sinθ.

So, the real parts here: (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
And the imaginary parts: - (24 sinθ - 36 cosθ) i.

Now, let's add both terms together to get the entire expression.

Real parts from first term: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ)
Real parts from second term: (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
So total real part: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts from first term: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i
Imaginary parts from second term: - (24 sinθ - 36 cosθ) i
So total imaginary part: [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ - 24 sinθ + 36 cosθ] i
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ * i
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ * i

Wait, but since we're only looking for the real part, maybe I can ignore the imaginary parts for now. So, the real part of the entire expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ for real θ.

I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is C, which is sqrt(A^2 + B^2).

Wait, actually, more precisely, A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as R cos(θ - δ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and tanδ = B/A. The maximum value is R because the cosine function has a maximum of 1.

So, in this case, our expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me write this as A cosθ + B sinθ, where A = 324 and B = -432.

So, maximum value is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2. 324 is 18^2, so 324^2 = (18^2)^2 = 18^4? Wait, no, 324 is 18^2, so 324^2 is (18^2)^2 = 18^4, but let me compute it directly.

324 * 324: Let's compute 30
