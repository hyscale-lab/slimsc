Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (xy).

Similarly, let's go back to equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z from equation (z), so let's substitute that.

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Compute 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's note this as equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy), x y = 2^(-2/3). But from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12). So substituting y into (xy):

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which simplifies to:

x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12):

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12) => x = 2^(-7/24), since x is positive.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that exponent.

Wait, 2^(-2/3) is 2^(-8/12). Then 2^(1/12) is 2^(1/12). So when you multiply, exponents add: (-8/12 + 1/12) = (-7/12). So x^2 = 2^(-7/12). Therefore, x = 2^(-7/24). Because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) is 2^(-7/24). Correct.

So x = 2^(-7/24). Let's note this as equation (x).

Now, from equation (y): y = x * 2^(-1/12). Substituting x:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8).

So y = 2^(-3/8).

Wait, let me confirm: 2^(-1/12) is 2^(-2/24). So x * 2^(-1/12) is 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8). Correct.

So now we have x, y, z:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Wait, let me convert all exponents to 24 denominators to check:

x: -7/24

y: -3/8 = -9/24

z: -5/12 = -10/24

So x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24)

Hmm, okay. Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let me compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Since logarithms turn products into sums, I can write this as log₂(x^4) + log₂(y^3) + log₂(z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z.

Since log₂(a^b) = b log₂ a.

But since x = 2^(-7/24), log₂ x = -7/24.

Similarly, log₂ y = -9/24, and log₂ z = -10/24.

So substituting:

4*(-7/24) + 3*(-9/24) + 2*(-10/24)

Compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24

3*(-9/24) = (-27)/24

2*(-10/24) = (-20)/24

Add them up:

(-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

So log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -75/24.

Taking absolute value: | -75/24 | = 75/24.

Simplify 75/24: both divisible by 3.

75 ÷ 3 = 25, 24 ÷3=8.

So 25/8.

Thus, the value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8. They are coprime.

Thus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

First, exponents:

x = 2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8)=2^(-9/24), z=2^(-5/12)=2^(-10/24).

So log₂ x = -7/24, log₂ y = -9/24, log₂ z = -10/24.

Compute 4 log x: 4*(-7/24)= -28/24

3 log y: 3*(-9/24)= -27/24

2 log z: 2*(-10/24)= -20/24

Sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -75/24.

Absolute value is 75/24 = 25/8. So yes, 25/8 is correct.

Thus, m + n = 25 +8=33. So the answer is 33.


To solve the system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into exponential form:

1. \( \log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \) implies \( \frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \) or \( x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2} \).
2. \( \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \) implies \( \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \) or \( y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3} \).
3. \( \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \) implies \( \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \) or \( z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4} \).

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we find \( x \) in terms of \( z \), and then substitute back to find \( z \). Solving these step-by-step, we determine:

- \( z = 2^{-5/12} \)
- \( x = 2^{-7/24} \)
- \( y = 2^{-3/8} \)

Next, we compute \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \) by taking the sum of weighted logarithms:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2 x + 3 \log_2 y + 2 \log_2 z
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
4 \cdot (-7/24) + 3 \cdot (-9/24) + 2 \cdot (-10/24) = \frac{-75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \( \left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \frac{25}{8} \). Thus, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), leading to \( m + n = 33 \).

\(\boxed{33}\)
