Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is between b and b² - 1, right? Because in base b, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b which is equal to b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² - 1.
2. The sum of the two digits equals the square root of n. So if n is written as d₁d₂ in base b, then d₁ + d₂ = sqrt(n). 

Given that, the example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63_13, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). 

So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions. 

Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, let's represent n in base b as d₁d₂, where d₁ is the first digit and d₂ is the second digit. So, in decimal, this would be n = d₁ * b + d₂. Also, since it's a two-digit number in base b, d₁ must be between 1 and b-1, and d₂ must be between 0 and b-1.

The sum of the digits is d₁ + d₂, which must equal sqrt(n). So,

d₁ + d₂ = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d₁ * b + d₂)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d₁ + d₂)² = d₁ * b + d₂

Expanding the left side:

d₁² + 2d₁d₂ + d₂² = d₁b + d₂

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

d₁² + 2d₁d₂ + d₂² - d₁b - d₂ = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of d₁ and d₂. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent n as d₁ * b + d₂, and then express the square root condition. 

So, sqrt(n) = d₁ + d₂, and n = (d₁ + d₂)².

But n is also equal to d₁ * b + d₂. So,

(d₁ + d₂)² = d₁ * b + d₂

Let me write this as:

b = [(d₁ + d₂)² - d₂] / d₁

Because I can rearrange the equation:

d₁ * b + d₂ = (d₁ + d₂)²

So,

d₁ * b = (d₁ + d₂)² - d₂

Thus,

b = [(d₁ + d₂)² - d₂] / d₁

Simplify the numerator:

(d₁ + d₂)² - d₂ = d₁² + 2d₁d₂ + d₂² - d₂

So,

b = (d₁² + 2d₁d₂ + d₂² - d₂) / d₁

Which can be written as:

b = d₁ + 2d₂ + (d₂² - d₂)/d₁

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach.

Since b must be an integer (and d₁ and d₂ are integers as digits in base b), let's denote s = d₁ + d₂. Then, n = s², and n = d₁b + d₂.

So, s² = d₁b + d₂.

But since d₂ = s - d₁ (because s = d₁ + d₂), we can substitute that into the equation:

s² = d₁b + (s - d₁)

Simplify:

s² = d₁b + s - d₁

Bring all terms to one side:

s² - s = d₁b - d₁

Factor d₁:

s² - s = d₁ (b - 1)

So,

d₁ = (s² - s) / (b - 1)

Since d₁ must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result of that division must be an integer d₁ in the valid range.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express b in terms of s and d₁.

Wait, from s² = d₁b + d₂, and d₂ = s - d₁, substituting:

s² = d₁b + s - d₁

Rearranged:

s² - s = d₁ (b - 1)

So,

b = (s² - s) / d₁ + 1

So, for given s and d₁, we can compute b.

But since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, (s² - s) must be divisible by d₁, and the resulting b must be greater than d₁, because in base b, d₁ must be less than b.

Wait, no, d₁ can be up to b-1, so as long as d₁ < b, which is already
