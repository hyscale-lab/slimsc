Okay, so I have this problem about Aya walking every morning. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

So, every day, Aya walks 9 kilometers. She goes at a constant speed, right? There are two scenarios given: one where she walks at speed 's' km/h and another where she walks faster, at 's + 2' km/h. Each time, her total time includes some time spent in a coffee shop, which is 't' minutes. My goal is to find out how long her walk will take when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I think I should write down what I know from both scenarios.

In the first scenario, her walking speed is 's' km/h, and the total time taken is 4 hours. But this time includes 't' minutes she spends in the coffee shop. So the actual walking time is 4 hours minus the coffee shop time. Wait, but the problem says the walk takes her 4 hours, including the coffee shop time. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

"When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop." Oh, okay, so the total time from start to finish, including the coffee shop, is 4 hours. But she only walks for part of that time. So the walking time is 4 hours minus the time she spends in the coffee shop.

Similarly, in the second scenario, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, so for both scenarios, the total time is the time taken to walk plus the coffee shop time. So, the walk time is (total time) minus (t minutes). But 't' is the same in both cases because it's the same coffee shop time. So, I can set up equations based on the walking time and the distance.

Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, I can write two equations.

Let me convert everything into hours because the speed is in km per hour. So t is given in minutes, so I'll need to convert that to hours when setting up the equations.

First scenario:
- Speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, time spent walking = 4 hours - (t/60) hours.
- So, walking time = (4 - t/60) hours.
- Distance walked is 9 km, so equation: 9 = s * (4 - t/60).

Second scenario:
- Speed = (s + 2) km/h
- Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes.
- Converting 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.
- Therefore, time spent walking is 2.4 hours - (t/60) hours.
- Distance walked is still 9 km, so equation: 9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60).

Now I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these equations to find s and t.

Let me write them down again:

1) 9 = s * (4 - t/60)
2) 9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)

Let me denote t/60 as T to make the equations less cluttered. So T = t/60. Then, t = 60T.

So now the equations become:

1) 9 = s*(4 - T)
2) 9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - T)

Now I have:

Equation 1: 9 = s*(4 - T)
Equation 2: 9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - T)

Now, I can express both equations in terms of s and T. Let me solve equation 1 for s.

From equation 1:
s = 9 / (4 - T)

Now plug this expression for s into equation 2.

Equation 2 becomes:
9 = ( (9/(4 - T)) + 2 ) * (2.4 - T )

Let me simplify the right-hand side.

First, calculate (9/(4 - T) + 2):

= (9 + 2*(4 - T)) / (4 - T)
= (9 + 8 - 2T) / (4 - T)
= (17 - 2T) / (4 - T)

So equation 2 becomes:
9 = [ (17 - 2T) / (4 - T) ] * (2.4 - T )

Multiply both sides by (4 - T):

9*(4 - T) = (17 - 2T)*(2.4 - T)

Let me compute both sides.

Left side: 9*(4 - T) = 36 - 9T

Right side: (17 - 2T)*(2.4 - T)

Let me expand this:

= 17*2.4 - 17*T - 2T*2.4 + 2T^2
= 40.8 - 17T - 4.8T + 2T^2
= 40.8 - 21.8T + 2T^2

So now, the equation is:

36 - 9T = 40.8 -
