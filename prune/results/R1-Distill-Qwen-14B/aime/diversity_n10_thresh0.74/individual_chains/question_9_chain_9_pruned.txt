Alright, so I've got this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember that logarithms can be manipulated using their properties. So, let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think it would be helpful to rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form. Because if log_b(a) = c, then that's equivalent to b^c = a. Let me try that.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. So, converting that, x^10 = y^x. Got it. So, equation (1) gives me x^10 = y^x.

Now, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Converting that, y^10 = x^{4y}. So, equation (2) is y^10 = x^{4y}.

Now, I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay. So, variables in exponents... this seems tricky, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring the exponents down. Let's try that.

Taking natural logs on both sides of equation (1):

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to:

10 ln x = x ln y

Similarly, for equation (2):

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which becomes:

10 ln y = 4y ln x

Alright, so now I have two equations:

1. 10 ln x = x ln y   => Let's call this equation (3)
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x   => Let's call this equation (4)

Hmm, so now I have two equations with ln x and ln y. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

From equation (3): 10 ln x = x ln y

I can solve for ln y:

ln y = (10 ln x) / x

Similarly, from equation (4): 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Substituting ln y from equation (3) into equation (4):

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x

Simplify the left side: 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x

Hmm, okay, so both sides have ln x. Since x > 1 and y > 1, ln x isn't zero. So, I can divide both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y

So, 100 / x = 4y => y = (100) / (4x) => y = 25 / x.

Okay, so y is 25 divided by x. Now, that's a useful relationship. Let me write that down: y = 25/x.

Now, I can substitute y = 25/x back into one of the earlier equations to solve for x. Let's pick equation (3) because it's simpler.

From equation (3): 10 ln x = x ln y

But y is 25/x, so ln y = ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x.

So, substituting that into equation (3):

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x)

Let's write that out:

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x

Hmm, let's bring all terms to one side to collect like terms. Let's add x ln x to both sides and subtract 10 ln x:

0 = x ln 25 - 10 ln x - x ln x

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Let me rearrange the equation:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln 25

Factor out ln x on the left:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25

Now, divide both sides by (10 + x):

ln x = (x ln 25) / (10 + x)

Hmm, okay. Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have a straightforward algebraic solution. But maybe I can find a clever substitution or think of x such that this holds.

Alternatively, I can write this as:

ln x = x ln 25 / (x + 10)

Let me denote t = x. Then, the equation becomes:

ln t = (t ln 25) / (t + 10)

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe I can rearrange terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express both sides in terms of exponents.

Let me consider equation (3), which we have as:

10 ln x = x ln y

But since y =25 / x, then:

10 ln x = x ln (25/x) = x (ln 25 - ln x)

So, 10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x

Bring the x ln x to the left:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln25

Factor ln x:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln25

Which is the same as before. So, perhaps I can write:

ln x = (x ln2
