Alright, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers, especially when their magnitude is given, it's often helpful to express them in polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can write \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier because multiplying and dividing by \( z \) will just involve adding and subtracting angles, respectively.

So, let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( 1/z \) would be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because the magnitude of \( 1/z \) is \( 1/|z| = 1/4 \), and the angle is the negative of the angle of \( z \).

Now, let's substitute \( z \) and \( 1/z \) into the expression:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplify the constants first. Multiply \( 75 + 117i \) by 4:

\( 75 \times 4 = 300 \),
\( 117i \times 4 = 468i \),
so that term becomes \( 300 + 468i \).

Similarly, multiply \( 96 + 144i \) by \( 1/4 \):

\( 96 \times (1/4) = 24 \),
\( 144i \times (1/4) = 36i \),
so that term becomes \( 24 + 36i \).

So now, the expression is:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to compute this expression. Since \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \) can be expressed in terms of cosine and sine, maybe I can expand this using Euler's formula.

Let me recall Euler's formula: \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, let's substitute these into the expression.

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)

Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Now, let's expand each term separately.

Starting with the first term:

Multiply \( 300 + 468i \) by \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \):

Using distributive property:

\( 300 \cos\theta + 300 i \sin\theta + 468i \cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta \)

Remember that \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term becomes \( -468 \sin\theta \).

So putting it all together:

\( 300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta + i(300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta) \)

Similarly, for the second term:

Multiply \( 24 + 36i \) by \( \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \):

\( 24 \cos\theta -24i \sin\theta + 36i \cos\theta -36i^2 \sin\theta \)

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term becomes \( +36 \sin\theta \).

So, the second term becomes:

\( 24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta + i(-24 \sin\theta + 36 \cos\theta) \)

Now, let's combine both terms by adding their real parts and imaginary parts.

First, the real parts:

From the first term: \( 300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta \)

From the second term: \( 24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta \)

Adding them together:

\( (300 \cos\theta + 24 \cos\theta) + (-468 \sin\theta + 36 \sin\theta) \)

Simplify:

\( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \)

Now, the imaginary parts:

From the first term: \( i(300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta) \)

From the second term: \( i(-24 \sin\theta + 36 \cos\theta) \)

Adding them together:

\( i(300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta -24 \sin\theta + 36 \cos\theta) \)

Simplify:

\( i(276 \sin\theta + 504 \cos\theta) \)

So, putting it all together, the entire expression is:

\[
(324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta) + i(276 \sin\theta + 504 \cos\theta)
\]

But we're only interested in the real part of this expression. So, the real part is:

\( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \)

Let me write that down as a function:

\( Re(\theta) = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \)

Our goal is to find the maximum value of \( Re(\theta) \) for real \( \theta \).

Hmm, okay. So, how do I find the maximum of this function? It's a function of a single variable \( \theta \), and it's of the form \( A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta \), but in this case, it's \( A \cos\theta - B \sin\theta \), where \( A = 324 \) and \( B = 432 \).

I remember that expressions like \( A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(B/A) \) or something like that. Wait, actually, let me be precise.

The standard identity is:

\( A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta = R \cos(\theta - \phi) \),

where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(B/A) \).

Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as \( R \sin(\theta + \phi) \) or similar, depending on the phase shift. But in any case, the maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), since the cosine function has a maximum of 1.

Wait, let me confirm that. If \( Re(\theta) = A \cos\theta - B \sin\theta \), which is \( A \cos\theta + (-B) \sin\theta \), so in the standard form, \( A \cos\theta + C \sin\theta \), with \( C = -B \).

So, the maximum of this expression is \( \sqrt{A^2 + C^2} \), which would be \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) because \( C = -B \), and squaring removes the sign. So, the maximum is \( \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \(324^2\):

324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 = 90,000; 24^2=576; cross term 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 =90000 +14400 +576= 90000+14400=104400; 104400+576=104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000; 32^2=1,024; cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=160,000+25,600=185,600; 185,600+1,024=186,624.

So, \(324^2 = 104,976\), and \(432^2=186,624\). Adding them: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

Taking the square root of 291,600. Let me see, 500^2=250,000, 540^2=291,600. Oh, yes, because 54^2=2,916, so 540^2=291,600. So, \( R = 540 \).

So, the maximum value of \( Re(\theta) = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \) is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, \( Re(\theta) \) can be written as \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \) or something? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about \( Re(\theta) = A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta \), but in this case, it's \( A \cos\theta - B \sin\theta \). So, it's similar to \( A \cos\theta + (-B) \sin\theta \), so the amplitude would be \( \sqrt{A^2 + (-B)^2} = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \), same as before.

So, the maximum value is indeed \( \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540 \). Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because sometimes when you have maximum of real part, maybe there's a different consideration. But in this case, because the expression only has a real part that depends on \( \cos\theta \) and \( \sin\
