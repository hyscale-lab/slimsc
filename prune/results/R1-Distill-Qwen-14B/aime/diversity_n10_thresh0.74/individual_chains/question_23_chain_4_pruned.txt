Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi ABCD. The rhombus is on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, okay.

First, let me visualize this. A rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the vertices of the rhombus are points on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are the lines connecting opposite vertices. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Or wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, actually, yes they are. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, that's an important property.

So, the rhombus is formed by four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. So, the diagonals are perpendicular and pass through the origin.

Given that, I
