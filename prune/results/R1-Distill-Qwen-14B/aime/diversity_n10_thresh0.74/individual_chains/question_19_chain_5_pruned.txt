Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's given and what's being asked.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. We need to find the product AB·AC.

Alright, let's jot down what I know. The circumradius R = 13, inradius r = 6, IA ⊥ OI. So, the incenter I is such that the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I.

First, let me recall some formulas related to triangle centers and inradius, circumradius.

I know that the inradius r = Δ/s, where Δ is the area of the triangle and s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R = (a b c)/(4Δ), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

Also, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI² = R(R - 2r). But wait, is that correct? Let me think. Yes, I think that's the formula: OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, OI = sqrt(R² - 2Rr).

Given R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI.

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, interesting.

But wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras:

IA² + OI² = OA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA = 13.

So, IA² + OI² = 13².

We already found OI² = 13, so IA² + 13 = 169 → IA² = 156 → IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, okay. So, IA is 2*sqrt(39). Now, I remember that the length of the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, but IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. Wait, no, that's not correct. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but IA is the distance from incenter to vertex A. So, IA is not the inradius, which is 6.

Wait, that's an important point. The inradius is the distance from I to BC, AC, or AB. So, IA is different; it's the length of the segment from I to A.

I need a formula for IA, the distance from the incenter to vertex A.

I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Is that correct? Let me think.

Wait, yes, I think that's right. Let
