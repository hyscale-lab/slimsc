Okay, so I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

First, let me write down what I know. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation is a bit more complex. It looks like each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Let me see: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, can I factor this by grouping? Let me try grouping terms with similar variables.

Looking at the terms, I notice that each pair of variables is multiplied by the square of the third. For example, a²b + a²c can be written as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c can be written as b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b can be written as c²(a + b). So, if I rewrite the entire expression:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

That's a good start. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c).

So, substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³.

So the second equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression more. Let's see if I can factor it in terms of (300 - a), (300 - b), (300 - c), but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, since the variables are symmetric, perhaps I can consider cases where two variables are equal or all three are equal. That might simplify things.

Case 1: All three variables are equal. So, a = b = c. Since a + b + c = 300, each would be 100. Let's check if this satisfies the second equation.

If a = b = c = 100, then each term in the second equation becomes 100² * 100 = 1,000,000. Since there are six terms, the total would be 6,000,000. Perfect, so (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

Case 2: Two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's suppose a = b ≠ c. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.

Now, let's compute the second equation with a = b and c = 300 - 2a.

The second equation becomes:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b, this simplifies to:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

a²b = a³
a²c = a²c
b²a = a³
b²c = a²c
c²a = a c²
c²b = a c²

So adding all these together:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + a c² + a c²
= 2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c².

So the equation becomes:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c² = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2:

a³ + a²c + a c² = 3,000,000.

But since c = 300 - 2a, substitute that in:

a³ + a²(300 - 2a) + a(300 - 2a)² = 3,000,000.

Let's compute each term:

First term: a³.

Second term: a²(300 - 2a) = 300a² - 2a³.

Third term: a(300 - 2a)². Let's expand (300 - 2a)² first: 300² - 2*300*2a + (2a)² = 90,000 - 1200a + 4a². Then, multiply by a: 90,000a - 1200a² + 4a³.

Now, sum all the terms:

a³ + (300a² - 2a³) + (90,000a - 1200a² + 4a³) = 3,000,000.

Combine like terms:

a³ - 2a³ + 4a³ = 3a³.

300a² - 1200a² = -900a².

And then 90,000a.

So the equation becomes:

3a³ - 900a² + 90,000a = 3,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a = 1,000,000.

Bring 1,000,000 to the left:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me see if I can factor this or find integer roots.

Let me try possible integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±2, ..., up to ±1,000,000. But that's a lot. Maybe I can try small integers first.

Let me test a=100: 100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000.

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. Oh, so a=100 is a root.

So (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor this cubic.

Divide a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1  -300   30000   -1000000
        100  -20000    1000000
      ----------------------------
        1   -200    10000        0

So the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0.

Now, set each factor equal to zero:

1. a = 100.
2. a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0.

Solve the quadratic equation:

a = [200 ± sqrt(200² - 4*1*10,000)] / 2

= [200 ± sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2

= [200 ± 0] / 2 = 100.

So the only real root is a = 100. But we already knew that. So in the case where a = b, the only solution is when a = b = c = 100, which is already considered in Case 1.

So, in the case where two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal. Thus, perhaps the only solution is (100,100,100). But wait, maybe I made a mistake here because when I set a = b, I assumed that c is different, but the solution ended up being a = b = c.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the only solution is when all three are equal. But wait, maybe I should check another case where two variables are equal but different from the third. Wait, but in that case, we saw that a=100 is the only solution, which makes all variables equal.

Wait, maybe I should explore another approach. Let's see if the second equation can be expressed differently.

We had earlier that the second equation is:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000
