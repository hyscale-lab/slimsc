Okay, so I have this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume V is lwh. So, given S=54 and V=23, I can set up the equations:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 → lw + lh + wh = 27

and

lwh = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain the box. The sphere's diameter must be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box because the sphere has to enclose the entire box. The space diagonal d of a box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²), so the radius r would be half of that, so r = d/2. Therefore, r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4. So, my goal is to minimize r², which means I need to minimize l² + w² + h² given the constraints of surface area and volume.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing l² + w² + h² with the constraints lw + lh + wh = 27 and lwh = 23.

I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but since it's a problem with symmetry, maybe there's a way to express variables in terms of each other.

Alternatively, maybe I can express two variables in terms of the third and then use calculus to find the minimum. Let me see.

Let me denote x = l, y = w, z = h.

So, we have:

xy + xz + yz = 27

and

xyz = 23

We need to minimize x² + y² + z².

I remember that for such optimization problems with symmetric constraints, sometimes the minimal occurs when variables are as equal as possible, but in this case, since the volume is fixed, maybe they aren't all equal. Wait, but let me check that.

Wait, if x = y = z, then it's a cube. Let's see if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x=3. Then volume would be x³ = 27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube case doesn't satisfy the volume constraint. So, the minimal r² might not correspond to a cube, but to some other proportions.

So, perhaps I need to express the problem in terms of fewer variables. Let me try to express h in terms of l and w.

From the volume equation, h = 23/(lw).

Substituting into the surface area equation:

lw + l*(23/(lw)) + w*(23/(lw)) = 27

Simplify:

lw + 23/w + 23/l = 27.

Hmm, that looks a bit messy, but maybe I can let u = l + w and v = lw. Wait, but I don't know if that'll help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of l.

Let me set l = a, w = b, so h = 23/(ab).

Then, the surface area equation becomes:

ab + a*(23/(ab)) + b*(23/(ab)) = 27

Simplify:

ab + 23/b + 23/a = 27.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps I can rearrange it.

Let me write it as ab = 27 - (23/a + 2
