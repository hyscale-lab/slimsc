Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The rhombus ABCD has all sides equal, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and I need to find the infimum of BD² across all possible such rhombuses. Hmm, okay.

First, I should recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are perpendicular only if it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, is that right?

Wait, no. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at 90 degrees. So, that's an important property.

So, if the rhombus has diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A and C are on the hyperbola, as are B and D. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D.

So, let's denote point A as (x, y). Then point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, point B would be (u, v), and point D would be (-u, -v). All four points lie on the hyperbola.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, which is equal to the distance between C and D, and so on.

But maybe there's another approach. Since the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, and both intersect at the origin, perhaps we can parameterize the points.

Let me think about the diagonals. Let’s say AC is one diagonal, and BD is the other. Since they are perpendicular, their slopes should be negative reciprocals if they are not vertical or horizontal.

But maybe we can express the diagonals as vectors. Let’s consider that diagonal AC has endpoints at (x, y) and (-x, -y), so the vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, diagonal BD has endpoints at (u, v) and (-u, -v), so vector BD is (-2u, -2v).

But the diagonals are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. So, AC · BD = 0. So, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 => 4xu + 4yv = 0 => xu + yv = 0. So, that's one condition.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let's compute the lengths of the sides. The side AB is from (x, y) to (u, v). So, its length squared is (x - u)² + (y - v)². Similarly, side BC is from (u, v) to (-x, -y), which has length squared (u + x)² + (v + y)². Since all sides are equal, these must be equal.

So, (x - u)² + (y - v)² = (u + x)² + (v + y)². Let me expand both sides:

Left side: x² - 2xu + u² + y² - 2yv + v²
Right side: u² + 2xu + x² + v² + 2yv + y²

Subtract left from right: 4xu + 4yv = 0. So, that's the same as xu + yv = 0, which was our earlier condition from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, that's consistent. So, the condition is automatically satisfied.

Therefore, the only constraints are that all four points lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are perpendicular, which gives xu + yv = 0.

Now, I think another approach is to parametrize the points. Maybe using parametric equations for the hyperbola.

The hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. A standard parametrization for hyperbola is x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, where a² = 20 and b² = 24. So, a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6).

So, let me write point A as (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ). Then point C is (-2√5 secθ, -2√6 tanθ).

Similarly, point B can be parametrized as (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ), and point D as (-2√5 secφ, -2√6 tanφ).

Now, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Alternatively, the dot product condition we had earlier, xu + yv = 0.

Wait, in terms of θ and φ, let me
