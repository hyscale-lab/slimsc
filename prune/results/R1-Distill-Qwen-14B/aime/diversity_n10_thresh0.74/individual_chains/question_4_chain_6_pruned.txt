Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about this. It's a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, the starting player is Alice. Bob wants to have a winning strategy, which would mean that for certain values of n, regardless of what Alice does on her first move, Bob can always respond in a way that forces him to win.

Let me try to model this. Let's define the positions as either "winning" (W) or "losing" (L). A position is losing if every possible move from that position leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there's at least one move that leads the opponent into a losing position.

Since the game ends when the last token is taken, n=0 is a losing position because the player can't make a move. So, starting from n=1 and moving upwards, I can try to determine whether each n is W or L.

Let me try to compute the first few positions manually.

n=0: L (game ends, last player wins)
n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win, so n=1 is W.
n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob is in a W position because he can take 1 and win. Wait, but that would mean Bob can win, which would make n=2 a losing position for Alice. Wait, no—wait, if it's Alice's turn at n=2, she can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can take 1 and win. So if Alice takes 1 from n=2, Bob wins. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 from n=2? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So Alice's only option is to take 1, which leads Bob to take 1 and win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So n=2 is L.

Wait, wait, I think I might have messed that up. Let's clarify: for each n, if any of the possible moves leads to the opponent being in a losing position, then the current n is W. If all moves lead to the opponent being in a W position, then the current n is L.

So for n=1: Alice can take 1, leading to n=0 (L for Bob). So Alice can force Bob into L, so n=1 is W.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leading to n=1 (W for Bob). So Bob is in a W position. Or, she can take 4, but that's not possible. So Alice has no move that leads Bob to L. So n=2 is L.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leading to n=2 (L for Bob). So Alice can force Bob into L. So n=3 is W.

n=4: Alice can take 1, leading to n=3 (W), or take 4, leading to n=0 (L). So if she takes 4, Bob is forced into L. So n=4 is W.

n=5: Alice can take 1, leading to n=4 (W), or take 4, leading to n=1 (W). So both options leave Bob in a W position. So n=5 is L.

n=6: Alice can take 1, leading to n=5 (L for Bob). So she can force Bob into L. So n=6 is W.

n=7: Alice can take 1, leading to n=6 (W), or take 4, leading to n=3 (W). So both options leave Bob
