Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in a list that meets certain conditions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's list out the given conditions:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Hmm, I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in this list. But before that, I need to figure out what the list actually looks like because the problem doesn't give it to me directly. So, I'll have to construct the list based on the given conditions.

Let me start by recalling some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique here, so only 9 appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But wait, the median here is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median can be a number in the list, especially for odd-length lists. So, this must be an even-length list where the median is the average of two middle numbers, which isn't present.

Also, all numbers are positive integers. So, I need to construct a list of positive integers that adds up to 30, has 9 as the unique mode, and the median is a positive integer not in the list.

Let me think about the mode first. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, the number of 9s has to be strictly greater than the count of any other number in the list. That means if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times, etc.

Next, the sum of all numbers is 30. So, the more 9s I have, the fewer other numbers I can have, but I also need to make sure the median condition is satisfied.

Let me consider possible lengths of the list. The median is a positive integer not in the list, so let's think about whether the list has an even or odd number of elements.

If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which must be in the list. But the problem says the median is not in the list. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Because for even-length lists, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So, if those two are different, their average might not be in the list.

Wait, but the median is a positive integer. So, if the two middle numbers add up to an even number, their average will be an integer. So, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, which implies they are both even or both odd.

So, let's suppose the list has 2k elements, where k is some positive integer. Then, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements when the list is ordered.

Given that the median is an integer not present, the k-th and (k+1)-th elements must add up to an even number, and their average is that integer. Also, that integer isn't present anywhere in the list.

So, I need to construct such a list. Let's start by considering the number of 9s.

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. Let's suppose the list has m 9s. Then, every other number can appear at most m-1 times.

Now, the sum is 30. So, 9*m + sum of other numbers = 30.

We also need to ensure that the median is an integer not present, so the list must be of even length, as I thought earlier.

Let me try to think about possible values of m and the length of the list.

Let me consider the minimal cases where the number of 9s is as small as possible to still be the unique mode.

Case 1: m = 2.

But wait, can m be 2? If another number appears once, then m=2 would be the maximum, but if another number appears twice as well, then 9 wouldn't be the unique mode. So, if m=2, all other numbers can appear at most once. Let's see if that's possible.

Sum contributed by 9s would be 2*9=18. Remaining sum is 30-18=12, which needs to be distributed among other numbers, each appearing at most once. So, the number of other numbers would be at least 12 (since each
