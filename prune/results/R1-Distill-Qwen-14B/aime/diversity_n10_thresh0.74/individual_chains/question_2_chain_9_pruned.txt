Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These are in the first quadrant. So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis.

Then, there's this family F of segments PQ, each of unit length (length 1). These segments lie in the first quadrant, with point P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1.

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, not being A or B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is part of the family F, right? Because AB is a segment from A to B, and since both are on the axes. Wait, let me check: A is on the x-axis, B is on the y-axis. So AB is indeed a member of F because it connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, and its length should be 1.

Wait, the problem says each segment PQ in F has unit length. So AB must be length 1. Let me verify that. The distance between A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, so AB is in F.

The point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and it's unique in that no other segment from F passes through it except AB itself. So, I need to find such a point C on AB, compute OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to C, equal to p/q, and then find p+q where p and q are coprime.

Alright, so first, I should parametrize AB. Let me find the equation of AB.

Points A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, since parametrizing from A to B, we can write parametric equations. Let me think. Let t be a parameter between 0 and 1. So, when t=0, we're at A (1/2,0), and when t=1, we're at B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, parametric equations are:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

So, x = (1 - t)/2 and y = (sqrt(3)t)/2 for t in [0,1].

So point C is somewhere on AB, so for some t between 0 and 1, C has coordinates ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)t)/2).

Now, I need to find the point C such that no other segment in F passes through it. So, for any other segment PQ in F, which connects a point P on the x-axis to a point Q on the y-axis, with PQ of length 1, except for AB itself, point C is not on PQ.

So, to find such a point C, I need to find a point on AB that is not on any other segment from F.

So, perhaps C is the point where the envelope of the family F touches AB. Because the envelope is the curve that is tangent to all the segments in F, so C might be the point of tangency.

Alternatively, maybe it's the point where AB intersects the envelope of F, which would mean that it's the only point on AB that's on the envelope, hence not lying on any other PQ from F.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model all the segments in F and find the region they cover, then find the point on AB that's not in that region except for AB. Wait, but since all PQs are in F, each of length 1, the region they cover is the area between the x-axis and y-axis, but bounded by some curve.

Wait, actually, all these segments PQ are lines from (p, 0) to (0, q) where sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p and q are positive numbers such that p² + q² = 1.

So, the equation of each segment PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² = 1.

So, perhaps the envelope of these lines is the curve that is tangent to all these lines, and any point on AB that's on this envelope would only be on AB and one other PQ, but the problem says it's unique in that it's only on AB. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope. Because at that point, AB is the
