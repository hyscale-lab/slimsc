Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, I need to find the largest four-digit number N. So, N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. The condition is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Interesting. So, for each digit in N, replacing that digit with 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

Let me break this down. Let's denote N as a four-digit number, say, ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, the condition is that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, I should start checking from 9999 downwards and see which one satisfies the condition. But that might take too long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, let's think about the properties of the number N. Let's denote the original number as N = ABCD.

When we change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD. So, 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, when we change B to 1, the number is A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7.

Same for changing C to 1: AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7.

And changing D to 1: ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, for each position, replacing the digit with 1 gives a multiple of 7.

Another way to think about this is that N has four different numbers, each differing by a single digit from 1, and each of these is divisible by 7.

Wait, perhaps I can model this with modular arithmetic. Let's consider each of these four cases:

1. Changing A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me compute the value of N mod 7 in each case. Let's denote N as ABCD, which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, when we change A to 1, the new number is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So, this is equal to (N - 1000A) + 1000*1 + (100B + 10C + D). Wait, maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, let's express each condition in terms of N.

Case 1: Change A to 1:
The new number is 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

But N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, the new number is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) - 1000A + 1000.

So, N - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is N + (1000 - 1000A) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, for other cases:

Case 2: Change B to 1:
The new number is 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Which is N - 100B + 100.

So, N + (100 - 100B) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Case 3: Change C to 1:
The new number is 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Which is N - 10C + 10.

So, N + (10 - 10C) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Case 4: Change D to 1:
The new number is 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Which is N - D + 1.

So, N + (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, in each case, we have:

1. N + (1000 - 1000A) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N + (100 - 100B) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N + (10 - 10C) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N + (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod 7

Alternatively, rearranged:

1. N ≡ (1000A - 1000) mod 7
2. N ≡ (100B - 100) mod 7
3. N ≡ (10C - 10) mod 7
4. N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me see.

Alternatively, let's denote N mod 7 as n. Then, for each case, we can write:

Case 1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

But 1000 ≡ k mod 7, 100 ≡ m mod 7, 10 ≡ p mod 7, and 1 ≡ q mod 7.

Perhaps we can compute these coefficients mod 7.

Compute 1000 mod 7.

Let me compute 10 mod 7 is 3.

10^1 mod7=3

10^2 mod7=3*3=9 mod7=2

10^3 mod7=2*3=6 mod7=6

10^3=1000, so 1000 mod7=6.

Similarly, 100=10^2, so 100 mod7=2.

10 mod7=3.

1 mod7=1.

So, 1000 mod7=6, 100 mod7=2, 10 mod7=3, 1 mod7=1.

So, now, let's express each case:

Case 1: Change A to 1:

The number is 1*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + D*1.

Which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Mod7, this is (6) + (2B) + (3C) + D ≡ 0 mod7.

Similarly, original N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Mod7, N ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + D.

So, for case 1, 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

But 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ (6A + 2B + 3C + D) + (6 - 6A) mod7.

Which is N + (6 - 6A) ≡ 0 mod7.

Wait, that's similar to earlier.

Alternatively, let's think of N ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + D mod7.

Case1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

But N mod7 is 6A + 2B + 3C + D.

So, 6 + 2B +3C + D = (6A + 2B +3C + D) + 6(1 - A) mod7.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.
