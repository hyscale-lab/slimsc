Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, let's think about this. It's a turn-based game with specific move options, so it sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve determining "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, we want to find all n where Bob can force a win. Since Alice goes first, that means that for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position n must be a losing position for Alice. Therefore, the positions where n is a losing position are the ones we're interested in, and we need to count how many such n exist up to 2024.

Let me try to model this. I think the best approach is to determine the pattern of winning and losing positions. I'll start by computing the first few positions manually and see if a pattern emerges.

Let's define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win with n tokens, and false otherwise.

Base case:
- P(0): The player cannot make a move, so they lose. So P(0) is false.
- P(1): The player takes 1 token and wins. So P(1) is true.
- P(2): The player takes 2 tokens? Wait, no, the options are only 1 or 4. So P(2): Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. If the current player takes 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So P(2) is false? Wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, no. If n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1. Then the opponent can take the last token and win. Alternatively, the current player can't take 4 because that would exceed the stack. So the only move is to take 1, which leads to the opponent winning. So P(2) is
