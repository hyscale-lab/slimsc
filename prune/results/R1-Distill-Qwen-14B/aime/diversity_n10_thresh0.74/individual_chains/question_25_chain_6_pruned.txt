Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. There are 900 residents in total. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem lists four items that residents can own: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Wait, actually, the candy hearts are mentioned as something everyone owns. So, every resident has at least a bag of candy hearts. That might be important later.

The numbers given are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and all 900 own candy hearts. Then it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four.

Hmm, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that this principle helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. But wait, in this case, we might not have all the individual intersection numbers, so maybe we need a different approach.

Let me think. The total number of residents is 900, and every one of them owns at least the candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are like a universal set here. That means the number of people owning any combination of the other three items plus the candy hearts must equal 900. 

But wait, how do the other ownerships add up? So, the four items are diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Since everyone owns C, we can think of the other three as optional, but within that framework.

The problem gives us the number of people owning each of D, G, S, but not the specific overlaps between them. However, it does tell us how many own exactly two or exactly three of these four things. 

I think I should model this using set theory. Let me denote:

- D = number of people owning diamond ring = 195
- G = number owning golf clubs = 367
- S = number owning garden spade = 562
- C = everyone, so 900.

But since C
