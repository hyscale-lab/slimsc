Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, let me try to unpack what a b-eautiful number is. 

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (that is, 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals sqrt(81) which is 9.

So, to generalize, for a number n to be b-eautiful, when we express n in base b, it should be a two-digit number. That means n is in the range [b, b^2 - 1], because the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b which is equal to b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b) which is b(b-1) = b^2 - b. Wait, wait, no, actually, the largest two-digit number in base b is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b(b-1) + (b-1) = (b-1)(b + 1) = b^2 - 1. So, n must satisfy b ≤ n ≤ b^2 - 1.

Additionally, when written in base b, n has two digits, say d1 and d2. So, n = d1*b + d2. And the sum d1 + d2 must equal sqrt(n). 

So, we can write the equation:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2

Expanding the left side:

d1² + 2*d1*d2 + d2² = d1*b + d2

Let me rearrange this equation:

d1² + 2*d1*d2 + d2² - d1*b - d2 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d2. But perhaps instead of treating it as a quadratic equation, I can think of it differently. Let's denote s = d1 + d2. Then the equation becomes s² = d1*b + d2.

But since s = d1 + d2, I can express d2 as s - d1. Then substituting into the equation:

s² = d1*b + (s - d1)
s² = d1*b + s - d1
s² - s = d1*(b - 1)
So, d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Hmm, so d1 must be an integer, and since d1 is a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1. Similarly, d2 is also a digit, so 0 ≤ d2 ≤ b-1. But wait, in a two-digit number, the first digit can't be zero, so d1 is at least 1. 

Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, d1 and d2 must be non-negative integers within the digit constraints.

So, from the equation d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1), both s² - s must be divisible by (b - 1), and d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1. Also, d2 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.

So, for each base b, we can find all possible s such that (s² - s) is divisible by (b-1), and then check whether d1 is a valid digit (1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1) and d2 is also a valid digit (0 ≤ d2 ≤ b-1). 

Wait, but s is the sum of two digits, so s can range from 1 + 0 = 1 up to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But s must also satisfy the equation s² = d1*b + d2, which, since d1*b + d2 is between b and b^2 -1, s² must be between b and b^2 -1. Therefore, s must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 -1). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is just less than b, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, because s is an integer.

Wait, let me think again. For example, in base 13, s is 6+3=9, and sqrt(81)=9. So, in that case, s is 9, which is less than the base 13. So, s can be up to b-1, but also, s must be at least sqrt(b). So, for a given base b, s can be from floor(sqrt(b)) + 1 up to b-1? Hmm, not sure. Maybe s can be any integer such that s² is in [b, b^2 -1], so s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)). But sqrt(b^2 -1) is just less than b, so s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.

Wait, let's take b=13. Then s can be from ceil(sqrt(13))=4 up to 12. And indeed, in the example, s=9, which is within that range.

So, for each base b, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1. For each s in that range, we can compute d1 = (s² - s)/(b-1). Then check if d1 is an integer between 1 and b-1, and then compute d2 = s - d1, and check if d2 is between 0 and b-1.

So, the process is:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:
   a. Compute the range of s: s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)), s_max = b-1.
   b. For each s from s_min to s_max:
      i. Compute numerator = s² - s
      ii. Check if (s² - s) is divisible by (b - 1). If yes:
          - Compute d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)
          - Check if 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1
          - Compute d2 = s - d1
          - Check if 0 ≤ d2 ≤ b-1
          - If all conditions met, then n = d1*b + d2 is b-eautiful
2. Count the number of such n for each b. Find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.

So, the plan is to iterate b from 2 upwards, for each b, iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, compute d1, check conditions, count the number of valid n's. Once a b is found where the count exceeds 10, that's our answer.

But since we're looking for the minimal b, we can start testing from b=2 upwards until we find the first b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.

This seems a bit time-consuming, but perhaps we can find a pattern or a way to compute it more efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the equation differently.

We have s² = d1*b + d2, and s = d1 + d2. So, substituting d2 = s - d1 into the first equation:

s² = d1*b + (s - d1)
s² = d1*(b - 1) + s

Rearranged:

d1*(b - 1) = s² - s

So, d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Which is the same as before.

So, for d1 to be integer, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b - 1) must divide (s² - s). So, (b-1) | s(s - 1)

So, for each s, (b-1) must be a divisor of s(s - 1). But since s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, perhaps we can find for each b, the number of s such that (b-1) divides s(s - 1). But this might still be a bit abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps we can iterate over s and see for which b, the above equation holds.

Wait, but since b can be up to a certain point, and we are looking for the minimal b with more than 10 solutions, perhaps it's better to iterate b from 2 upwards, for each b, compute how many s satisfy the conditions, and when we find the first b where this count is more than 10, that's our answer.

So, let's try to write down the steps for a given b:

For a given base b:

1. s must be an integer such that ceil(sqrt(b)) ≤ s ≤ b - 1
2. For each s in this range, check if (s² - s) is divisible by (b - 1). If yes:
   a. Compute d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)
   b. Check if d1 is between 1 and b - 1
   c. Compute d2 = s - d1
   d. Check if d2 is between 0 and b - 1
   e. If all conditions met, count this as a valid b-eautiful number.

So, for each b, we can compute the count. Let's try some small b's and see how it goes.

Starting with b=2:

But wait, for b=2, the two-digit numbers in base 2 are from 2 (10_2) to 3 (11_2). So, n can be 2 or 3.

For b=2:

s_min = ceil(sqrt(2)) = 2
s_max = 1 (since b=2, so s_max = 2-1=1). Wait, that's a problem because s_min is 2 and s_max is 1. So, no possible s. So, no b-eautiful numbers for b=2.

Similarly, b=3:

s_min = ceil(sqrt(3))=2
s_max = 2

So, s=2.

Check if (2² - 2) is divisible by (3-1)=2.

(4 - 2)=2, which is divisible by 2. So, d1=2/2=1.

Then d2 = 2 - 1 = 1.

Check if d1 is 1, which is ≤2, and d2=1 ≤2. So, it's valid.

n = 1*3 + 1=4

Check if sqrt(4)=2, and 1+1=2. Yes, that works.

So, for b=3, there is 1 b-eautiful number.

b=4:

s_min=ceil(sqrt(4))=2
s_max=3.

So, s
