Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere or outside. When it's inside, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, let's think about the torus inside the sphere first. When the torus is resting inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is entirely inside. The point of tangency would be where the sphere and the torus just touch without intersecting. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is smaller? Wait, no, the sphere's size is fixed. So, when the torus is placed outside the sphere, I guess the sphere is inside the torus? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the sphere is fixed at radius 11, and the torus can be placed either inside or outside the sphere. When T is inside S, it's internally tangent. When T is outside S, it's externally tangent.

Wait, perhaps when it's externally tangent, the torus is outside the sphere, so the sphere is inside the torus. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me recall that for two surfaces to be tangent, they share a common tangent plane at the point of tangency. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they are tangent along another circle.

I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

I think this problem relates to the geometry of the torus and sphere. Maybe I need to find the distance between their centers and then relate it to the radii of the tangent circles.

Let me think about the centers. The sphere S has a fixed center, let's say at the origin for simplicity, with radius 11. The torus T is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units from the center of that circle.

So, the major radius R of the torus is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So, the torus can be described in coordinates as the set of points where the distance from any point (x, y, z) to the z-axis is sqrt(x^2 + y^2), which must satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 +
