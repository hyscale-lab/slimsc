Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus is kind of a big donut where the hole is size 6 and the tube has radius 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of the sphere, being internally tangent along a circle, and also on the outside, externally tangent along another circle. We need to find the radii of these two circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute the difference r_i - r_o. Finally, express this difference as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n.

First, I think I need to understand what it means for the torus to be tangent to the sphere along a circle. When the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is a circle on both the torus and the sphere. Similarly, when it's outside, it's another circle. So, the radii of these circles will depend on the geometry of the torus and the sphere.

Let me recall some properties of a torus. The torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this problem, R is 6, and r is 3.

When you have a sphere of radius 11, and the torus is inside it, the sphere will touch the torus along a circle. I think I can model this by considering the torus and the sphere in 3D space and finding the condition where they are tangent.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's imagine the torus is centered at the origin, and its axis of rotation is along the z-axis. The generating circle is in the x-y plane, centered at (R, 0, 0), which is (6, 0, 0). So, the equation of the torus can be written in parametric form as:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

Where R = 6, r = 3, and θ and φ are angles parameterizing the torus.

The sphere is centered at the origin as well, with radius 11. So, its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the point of tangency is a circle. Let's think about what this circle looks like. It's a circle on both the sphere and the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the external tangent will also form a circle.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and the sphere touch each other, and these points will lie on a circle. Since both are symmetric around the z-axis, this circle of tangency will lie in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, so the equation of the plane can be written as z = k for some constant k.

So, let's find the value of k for both internal and external tangency. Then, we can find the radius of the circle of tangency in each case.

First, let's consider internal tangency. The torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere is larger, and the torus is smaller.

Imagine the torus is just touching the sphere from the inside. The farthest point on the torus from the origin would be when moving in the positive x-direction. The center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0), and the point on the generating circle is at (6 + 3, 0, 0) = (9, 0, 0). So, the distance from the origin to this point is 9, which is less than 11. So, it's inside the sphere. The sphere has points up to radius 11, so the torus does not reach the sphere's surface at the farthest point in that direction.

Wait, but they are tangent. So, perhaps the point of tangency is somewhere else. Maybe along the "equator" of the torus, which is the circle where z = 0, which would have a larger radius.

Wait, the torus's equator (where z=0) has a radius of R + r = 6 + 3 = 9 in the x-y plane. But the sphere has radius 11, so this equator is inside the sphere.

But when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, maybe the point of tangency is where the sphere just touches the outer part of the torus.

Alternatively, perhaps we should think about the distance from the origin to the torus. The torus is a surface, so the distance from the origin to any point on the torus varies.

Let me consider a point on the torus. Let's parameterize it as:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

So, the distance squared from the origin is:

x² + y² + z² = (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 (cos² φ + sin² φ) + (3 sin θ)^2
= (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + 9 sin² θ

Simplify that:

= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin² θ
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ)
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (1)
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9
= 45 + 36 cos θ

So, the distance squared from the origin to any point on the torus is 45 + 36 cos θ.

Now, for internal tangency, the sphere of radius 11 must touch the torus at some point(s). The minimal and maximal distances from the origin to the torus will help here.

The maximum distance occurs when cos θ is maximum, which is 1. So, max distance squared is 45 + 36(1) = 81, which is 9. Wait, 9 is less than 11, but that can't be because the sphere is radius 11. Hmm, wait, maybe I messed up.

Wait, let me double-check the distance squared calculation.

x² + y² + z² = (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 (cos² φ + sin² φ) + (3 sin θ)^2
= (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + 9 sin² θ

Expanding (6 + 3 cos θ)^2: 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ

Adding 9 sin² θ: 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin²
