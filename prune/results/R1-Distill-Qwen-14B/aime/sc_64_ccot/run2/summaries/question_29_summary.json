      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize it first.\n\nWe have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, I imagine that these four points lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting because if four points lie on a circle, it's called a cyclic quadrilateral. That might come in handy later.\n\nGiven measurements: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. I need to find CE.\n\nLet me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, AB is the length, and BC is the height. That makes ABCD a rectangle with sides 107 and 16.\n\nSimilarly, rectangle EFGH has FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is the length, FG is the height. So, EFGH is a longer and taller rectangle compared to ABCD.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are on a straight line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F in that order. Wait, but the order might matter. I should figure out the order.\n\nSince ABCD is a rectangle, the order of the letters suggests that AB is adjacent to BC, so ABCD is arranged such that A is connected to B, B to C, C to D, D to A. Similarly, EFGH would have E connected to F, F to G, G to H, H to E.\n\nNow, D, E, C, F being collinear\u2014so starting from D, then E, then C, then F? Or some other order? Hmm.\n\nWait, in rectangle ABCD, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A, D are from the first rectangle, and H, G are from the second rectangle. That suggests that these points form a cyclic quadrilateral.\n\nSo, let me think about the cyclic quadrilateral ADHG. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles must be 180 degrees. Alternatively, the power of a point might be useful here.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to assign coordinates to each point and solve algebraically. That might be more straightforward.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the points.\n\nLet me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, AB is 107.\n\nSo, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (16, 0) because DC is BC which is 16. Wait, no, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16.\n\nWait, wait, no. In rectangle ABCD, AB is adjacent to BC. So, AB is the length, BC is the height.\n\nSo, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (0,16) because BC is 16. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think.\n\nWait, in rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, AB is adjacent to BC. So, if I have D at (0,0), then C would be at (a,0), and B would be at (a, b), and A at (0, b). But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to assign coordinates such that the line on which D, E, C, F lie is the x-axis. So, let me place D at (0,0), and the line DC is along the x-axis.\n\nWait, but in rectangle ABCD, D is a corner. If I place D at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, C would be at (c,0), B at (c, b), and A at (0, b), where c and b are the lengths of the sides.\n\nGiven that BC = 16, so BC is the vertical side from C to B. So, BC is of length 16, meaning that the vertical side is 16. AB is 107, which is the horizontal side from A to B, so AB is 107. So, AB is the length of the rectangle.\n\nWait, no. Wait, AB is a side of the rectangle. So, if ABCD is a rectangle, AB is one side, BC is another. So, AB is the horizontal side, BC is the vertical side.\n\nSo, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (0,16) because BC is 16. Then, B is at (107, 16), since AB is 107. Then, A is at (107, 0). Wait, no, that can't be right because AD would be from A(107,0) to D(0,0), which would be 107, but AD should be equal to BC, which is 16. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I mixed up the sides. Let me get this right.\n\nIn rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, AB is adjacent to BC. So, AB is the length, BC is the height.\n\nSo, if I place D at (0,0), then moving to C, which is adjacent to D, but since it's a rectangle, CD is equal to AB. Wait, no, CD is equal to AB because opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD, and BC = AD.\n\nWait, maybe I should assign coordinates more carefully.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s assign coordinates as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s place point D at (0, 0).\n\nSince ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D, the adjacent points are C and A.\n\nIf we move along DC, which is equal to AB. So, AB is 107, so DC is 107. So, point C is at (107, 0).\n\nThen, from C, moving up to B, which is BC = 16. So, point B is at (107, 16).\n\nThen, from B, moving left to A, which is AB = 107, so point A is at (0, 16).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- D: (0, 0)\n- C: (107, 0)\n- B: (107, 16)\n- A: (0, 16)\n\nYes, that way, AB is 107 (from (0,16) to (107,16)), BC is 16 (from (107,16) to (107,0)), CD is 107 (from (107,0) to (0,0)), and DA is 16 (from (0,0) to (0,16)). Perfect.\n\nSo, rectangle ABCD is set with those coordinates.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. The points E, F, G, H. We know FG =17 and EF=184. So, EF is one side, FG is another.\n\nAlso, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F.\n\nSince D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). So, E and F must lie somewhere along this line.\n\nWait, but the line is D-E-C-F, so perhaps E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or E is beyond D, and F is between D and C? Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, but doesn't specify the order. So, it could be D-E-C-F or E-D-C-F or some other permutation.\n\nBut since E and F are points from rectangle EFGH, perhaps their positions are such that E is on one side and F is on the other. Let me think.\n\nBut maybe it's better to assign coordinates to E and F on the x-axis.\n\nLet me denote E as (e, 0) and F as (f, 0). Since they are on the line DC, which is the x-axis.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. So, E is connected to F, F to G, G to H, H to E.\n\nGiven that EF =184, so the distance between E and F is 184. So, |f - e| =184.\n\nFG =17, so FG is the vertical side. So, from F, moving up (assuming standard orientation) to G, which would be at (f, 17). Similarly, from E, moving up to H, which would be at (e, h), but since it's a rectangle, H should be at (e, 17), because FG is vertical and of length 17. Wait, but that depends on the orientation.\n\nWait, rectangle EFGH: if EF is the base, then FG is the height. So, if E is at (e,0) and F is at (f,0), then G would be at (f,17), and H would be at (e,17). So, EFGH has sides EF =184, FG=17.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\n- E: (e, 0)\n- F: (f, 0)\n- G: (f,17)\n- H: (e,17)\n\nNow, the problem states that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (e,17), G (f,17) lie on a circle.\n\nSo, four points lie on a circle. Let me write down their coordinates:\n\nA: (0,16)\nD: (0,0)\nH: (e,17)\nG: (f,17)\n\nWe can use the condition for four points to lie on a circle. One way is to use the general equation of a circle and plug in the points to find constraints on e and f.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. Wait, but f is already used here. Maybe better to use different letters. Let me write it as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2hy + k = 0.\n\nSo, plugging in point D (0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + k = 0 => k =0.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2hy =0.\n\nNow, plug in point A (0,16):\n\n0 + (16)^2 + 0 + 2h(16) =0 => 256 +32h =0 => 32h = -256 => h = -8.\n\nSo, now equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx -16y =0.\n\nNext, plug in point H (e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (17)^2 + 2g e -16*17 =0.\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G (f,17):\n\nf\u00b2 + (17)^2 + 2g f -16*17 =0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) e\u00b2 + 289 + 2g e - 272 =0 => e\u00b2 + 2g e +17=0.\n\n2) f\u00b2 +289 +2g f -272=0 => f\u00b2 +2g f +17=0.\n\nSo, both e and f satisfy the same quadratic equation in terms of g. Interesting.\n\nSo, equation (1): e\u00b2 +2g e +17 =0.\n\nEquation (2): f\u00b2 +2g f +17 =0.\n\nSo, both e and f are roots of the equation x\u00b2 + 2g x +17 =0.\n\nWait, but a quadratic equation can have at most two roots. So, unless e and f are the same, but in our case, E and F are distinct points because EF=184. So, e \u2260 f.\n\nThus, the quadratic equation x\u00b2 +2g x +17=0 has two roots e and f. Therefore, by Vieta's formula, we have:\n\ne + f = -2g.\n\ne * f =17.\n\nHmm, that's useful.\n\nSo, e*f =17.\n\nBut we also know that |f - e|=184 because EF=184. Since E and F are on the x-axis, the distance between them is |f - e|=184.\n\nAssuming f > e, then f - e =184.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf = e +184.\n\nAnd e*f =17.\n\nSo, substituting f = e +184 into e*f =17:\n\ne*(e +184) =17 => e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in e.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\ne\u00b2 +184e -17 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17)] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2 = (180 +4)^2 =180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2=32400 +1440 +16=33856.\n\n4*17=68.\n\nSo, discriminant is 33856 +68=33924.\n\nWhat is sqrt(33924)?\n\nLet me compute: 184\u00b2 is 33856, 185\u00b2=34225.\n\nSo, 184^2=33856, 184.5^2= (184 +0.5)^2=184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.5 +0.25=33856 +184 +0.25=34040.25.\n\nBut 33924 is between 33856 and 34040.25.\n\nCompute 184.2^2: 184^2 + 2*184*0.2 +0.2\u00b2=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64.\n\nHmm, that's larger than 33924.\n\nWait, 184.1^2= (184 +0.1)^2=184\u00b2 +2*184*0.1 +0.01=33856 +36.8 +0.01=33892.81.\n\nWhich is less than 33924.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924) is between 184.1 and 184.2.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake because the discriminant is 33924, which may be a perfect square.\n\nWait, let me check: 184. Let's see, 184^2=33856, 184*184=33856, 184*185=33856+184=34040.\n\nWait, 184. Let me try 184.5: 184.5^2= (184 +0.5)^2=184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.5 +0.25=33856 +184 +0.25=34040.25.\n\nBut that's larger than 33924. So, not a perfect square. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation earlier.\n\nWait, 184^2 is 33856. Then, 184*184=33856, 184*185=33856+184=34040.\n\nWait, 184*184.5=34040.25? Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut regardless, perhaps I can keep it as sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481). Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor 33924.\n\nLet me see: 33924 divided by 4 is 8481.\n\n8481: Let's see, 8481 divided by 3 is 2827.\n\n2827: Let's check divisibility by 3: 2+8+2+7=19, not divisible by 3.\n\nDivide by 7: 2827 /7= 403.857... No.\n\nDivide by 11: 2827/11=257, because 11*257=2827. Wait, 11*250=2750, 11*7=77, so 2750+77=2827. Yes.\n\nSo, 8481=3*11*257.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*3*11*257)=2*sqrt(3*11*257)=2*sqrt(8481). Hmm, not a perfect square.\n\nSo, perhaps the roots are irrational. So, e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)]/2.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to compute e and f numerically. Perhaps I can find CE in terms of e and f.\n\nWait, the problem is to find CE. Point C is at (107,0), and E is at (e,0). So, CE is |107 - e|.\n\nSo, CE = |107 - e|.\n\nIf I can find e, then I can compute CE.\n\nBut from earlier, e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nSo, e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17)]/2.\n\nWait, 184\u00b2 is 33856, 4*17=68. So, sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, perhaps I can express e as:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1 2*sqrt(8481)]/2 = -92 \u00b1 sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, e = -92 + sqrt(8481) or e = -92 - sqrt(8481).\n\nBut since E is on the line DC, which is from D(0,0) to C(107,0). So, if E is between D and C, e would be between 0 and 107. Alternatively, E could be beyond C, so e >107 or e <0.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E could be on either side of D or C.\n\nBut if I consider the quadratic equation, e and f are roots of x\u00b2 +184x -17=0.\n\nSo, the sum of roots e + f = -184, and product e*f = -17.\n\nWait, wait a second, earlier I thought e*f=17, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check.\n\nEarlier, I had the equation x\u00b2 +2g x +17=0, with e and f as roots.\n\nWait, no, wait. The quadratic equation was x\u00b2 +2g x +17=0, with roots e and f.\n\nSo, from Vieta's formula:\n\ne + f = -2g,\n\ne * f =17.\n\nBut earlier, we also had f = e +184.\n\nSo, combining these, e*(e +184) =17.\n\nWhich led to e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nWait, but that would make e*f=17, but with f = e +184.\n\nSo, e*(e +184)=17 => e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nSo, correct. So, the product e*f=17, which is positive. So, e and f have the same sign.\n\nAnd since f = e +184, if e is positive, then f is even more positive. If e is negative, f is e +184, which could be positive or negative depending on e.\n\nWait, let's think about possible positions of E and F.\n\nSince E and F are points on the line DC, which is the x-axis from D(0,0) to C(107,0).\n\nBut E and F could be on either side of D and C.\n\nBut let's see: if E is between D and C, then e is between 0 and 107, and F would be at e +184. But e +184 would be greater than 107, so F would be beyond C.\n\nAlternatively, if E is beyond C, then e >107, and F = e +184 would be even further.\n\nAlternatively, E could be on the left of D, so e <0, and F would be e +184. If e is negative, e +184 could be positive or negative.\n\nWait, but if e is negative, say e = -k where k>0, then f = -k +184. So, if k <184, f is positive, meaning F is on the right of D. If k=184, f=0. If k>184, f is negative.\n\nBut in any case, E and F can be on either side of D and C.\n\nBut perhaps the position where E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.\n\nBut let's think about the circle passing through A, D, H, G.\n\nPoints A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17).\n\nIf E is between D and C, then e is between 0 and 107, but then F would be at e +184, which would be greater than 184, which is way beyond C.\n\nAlternatively, if E is on the left of D, e negative, then F is e +184, which could be positive or negative.\n\nWait, let's try to find e and f.\n\nWe have e + f = -2g, and e*f=17.\n\nBut also, from the quadratic equation, e and f satisfy e + f = -184.\n\nWait, no. Wait, earlier we had f = e +184, and e*f=17.\n\nSo, substituting f = e +184 into e*f=17, we get e*(e +184)=17.\n\nSo, that's e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nSo, e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17)]/2.\n\nCompute sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17):\n\n184\u00b2=33856,\n\n4*17=68,\n\nSo, sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924).\n\nWhich, as we saw earlier, is approximately 184.16.\n\nSo, e = [ -184 \u00b1 184.16 ] /2.\n\nSo, two possibilities:\n\n1) e = [ -184 + 184.16 ] /2 = (0.16)/2=0.08.\n\n2) e = [ -184 -184.16 ] /2 = (-368.16)/2 = -184.08.\n\nSo, e is approximately 0.08 or -184.08.\n\nHmm, let's check the first case: e \u22480.08.\n\nThen, f = e +184 \u22480.08 +184=184.08.\n\nSo, E is at approximately (0.08, 0), F at (184.08,0).\n\nBut in this case, point E is near D, and F is way beyond C.\n\nAlternatively, e\u2248-184.08, then f= e +184\u2248-184.08 +184\u2248-0.08.\n\nSo, E is at (-184.08, 0), F at (-0.08,0).\n\nWait, that would mean F is just left of D (since D is at (0,0)), and E is far to the left.\n\nBut in the problem statement, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if E is at (-184.08,0) and F is at (-0.08,0), then the order would be E, F, D, C on the line. So, that's possible.\n\nBut in both cases, E is either near D or far to the left.\n\nBut let's think about the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17).\n\nIf E is at approximately 0.08, then H is at (0.08,17), G is at (184.08,17).\n\nBut point G is at (184.08,17), which is far to the right. But point A is at (0,16), which is near D.\n\nAlternatively, if E is at (-184.08,0), then H is at (-184.08,17), and G is at (-0.08,17). So, H is far to the left, G is near D.\n\nBut in both cases, the circle passes through A, D, H, G.\n\nWait, but perhaps the circle would be determined uniquely by points A, D, H, G. So, perhaps both possibilities are valid, but which one is correct?\n\nHmm, perhaps we need more information.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the position of E relative to D and C, so maybe both are possible, but perhaps the length CE is the same in both cases.\n\nWait, let's compute CE in both cases.\n\nCase 1: E is at approximately 0.08, so CE = |107 - 0.08| \u2248106.92.\n\nCase 2: E is at approximately -184.08, so CE=|107 - (-184.08)|=|107 +184.08|=291.08.\n\nBut the problem is asking for CE, which is a length, so it's positive.\n\nBut we need an exact value, not an approximate. So, perhaps the exact value is 107 \u00b1 e, where e is the solution.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find e in terms of the quadratic equation.\n\nWe have e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nSo, e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17)]/2.\n\nWhich is e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)]/2.\n\nBut 33924=4*8481, so sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(8481).\n\nThus, e = [-184 \u00b12*sqrt(8481)]/2 = -92 \u00b1 sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, e is either -92 + sqrt(8481) or -92 - sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, sqrt(8481) is approximately 92.1, as 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649.\n\nSo, sqrt(8481)\u224892.1.\n\nSo, e \u2248-92 +92.1\u22480.1, or e\u2248-92 -92.1\u2248-184.1.\n\nWhich matches our earlier approximation.\n\nSo, e is either approximately 0.1 or -184.1.\n\nThus, CE is |107 - e|.\n\nIn the first case, e\u22480.1, so CE\u2248107 -0.1=106.9.\n\nIn the second case, e\u2248-184.1, so CE\u2248107 - (-184.1)=291.1.\n\nBut the problem is about exact value, not approximate. So, perhaps I can write CE as 107 - e, but e is either -92 + sqrt(8481) or -92 - sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but CE is |107 - e|.\n\nSo, if e = -92 + sqrt(8481), then CE=|107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))|=|199 - sqrt(8481)|.\n\nIf e = -92 - sqrt(8481), then CE=|107 - (-92 - sqrt(8481))|=|199 + sqrt(8481)|=199 + sqrt(8481).\n\nBut sqrt(8481)=sqrt(81*104.716)=9*sqrt(104.716). Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 8481 is a perfect square? Let me check.\n\n92^2=8464,\n\n93^2=8649.\n\nSo, 8481 is between them. 92.1^2= (92 +0.1)^2=92\u00b2 + 2*92*0.1 +0.1\u00b2=8464 +18.4 +0.01=8482.41.\n\nWait, 8482.41 is larger than 8481, so 92.1^2\u22488482.41, which is more than 8481. So, sqrt(8481) is less than 92.1.\n\nWait, 92.0^2=8464,\n\n92.05^2=92^2 +2*92*0.05 +0.05^2=8464 +9.2 +0.0025=8473.2025.\n\nStill less than 8481.\n\n92.1^2=8482.41, as above.\n\nSo, sqrt(8481) is between 92.05 and 92.1.\n\nBut this isn't helpful for exact value. So, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find CE without directly computing e.\n\nWait, CE is |107 - e|.\n\nFrom earlier, e = (-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17))/2.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express CE in terms of the quadratic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find CE\u00b2.\n\nCE\u00b2 = (107 - e)^2.\n\nBut from the quadratic equation, e\u00b2 = -184e +17.\n\nSo, CE\u00b2 = (107 -e)^2 =107\u00b2 -2*107*e + e\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting e\u00b2 = -184e +17,\n\nCE\u00b2 =107\u00b2 -214e + (-184e +17) =107\u00b2 +17 - (214 +184)e.\n\nSo, CE\u00b2= (107\u00b2 +17) - 398e.\n\nHmm, but I still have e in there. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find 107 - e.\n\nLet me denote x =107 - e.\n\nThen, e =107 -x.\n\nSubstitute into e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\n(107 -x)^2 +184*(107 -x) -17=0.\n\nExpand:\n\n(11449 -214x +x\u00b2) + (184*107 -184x) -17=0.\n\nCompute 184*107:\n\nLet me compute 180*107=19260,\n\n4*107=428,\n\nSo, 19260+428=19688.\n\nSo,\n\n11449 -214x +x\u00b2 +19688 -184x -17=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11449 +19688 -17 = (11449 +19688)=31137; 31137 -17=31120.\n\n-214x -184x = -398x.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 -398x +31120=0.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 -398x +31120=0.\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\nx = [398 \u00b1 sqrt(398\u00b2 -4*1*31120)] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n398\u00b2= (400 -2)^2=160000 - 2*400*2 +4=160000 -1600 +4=158404.\n\n4*1*31120=124480.\n\nSo, discriminant=158404 -124480=33924.\n\nWhich is the same discriminant as before, sqrt(33924)=184.16.\n\nSo, x = [398 \u00b1184.16]/2.\n\nCompute:\n\nx = (398 +184.16)/2 \u2248582.16/2\u2248291.08.\n\nx = (398 -184.16)/2\u2248213.84/2\u2248106.92.\n\nSo, x=291.08 or x\u2248106.92.\n\nSo, x=CE is approximately 106.92 or 291.08.\n\nBut the problem asks for CE, and in the context, perhaps it's the shorter distance.\n\nWait, but we need an exact value.\n\nWait, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, x= [398 \u00b12*sqrt(8481)]/2=199 \u00b1sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, CE=199 \u00b1sqrt(8481).\n\nBut which one is it?\n\nHmm, earlier, when e was approximately 0.08, CE was approximately 107 -0.08\u2248106.92=199 -sqrt(8481), since sqrt(8481)\u224892.1.\n\n199 -92.1\u2248106.9.\n\nSimilarly, when e\u2248-184.08, CE\u2248107 -(-184.08)=291.08\u2248199 +92.1=291.1.\n\nSo, CE can be either 199 +sqrt(8481) or 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut which one is the correct answer?\n\nWait, perhaps I can look back at the circle condition.\n\nIf E is at e\u22480.08, then H is at (0.08,17), and G is at (184.08,17). So, the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(0.08,17), G(184.08,17).\n\nAlternatively, if E is at e\u2248-184.08, then H is at (-184.08,17), G is at (-0.08,17). So, the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(-184.08,17), G(-0.08,17).\n\nBut in both cases, the circle exists. So, both are possible.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it just says that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, both configurations are possible, leading to two possible values for CE.\n\nBut the problem asks for the length of CE. Since length is positive, both are positive, but which one is intended?\n\nWait, perhaps in the configuration where E is between D and C, which would make CE =107 - e, and e is positive but small, so CE\u2248107.\n\nAlternatively, if E is beyond C, then CE would be e -107, but in that case, e would be greater than 107, but earlier, in the first case, e\u22480.08, which is less than 107, so CE=107 -e\u2248107.\n\nBut in the other case, e\u2248-184.08, so CE=107 - (-184.08)=291.08.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is designed so that CE is 107 - e, where e is positive.\n\nBut without more information, I can't be certain. But perhaps the problem expects the shorter length.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf E is to the right of D, then CE=107 -e.\n\nIf E is to the left of D, then CE=107 -e, but e is negative, so CE=107 +|e|.\n\nBut in either case, CE is positive.\n\nBut the exact value is either 199 +sqrt(8481) or 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut 199 -sqrt(8481)=199 -92.1\u2248106.9, which is approximately 107.\n\nWait, but 199 -sqrt(8481)=107 -e, where e= -92 +sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but perhaps the exact value is 107 -e, where e is as per the quadratic.\n\nBut I'm stuck here. Maybe I can think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the circle condition gives another equation. Let me try to find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, G.\n\nPoints A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17).\n\nWe can find the equation of the circle passing through these four points.\n\nWe already have the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2hy =0.\n\nWe found h=-8, so equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx -16y=0.\n\nNow, plugging in point H(e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 +2g e -16*17=0.\n\nWhich is e\u00b2 + 289 +2g e -272=0 => e\u00b2 +2g e +17=0.\n\nSimilarly, for G(f,17):\n\nf\u00b2 +2g f +17=0.\n\nSo, e and f satisfy the same equation, which is why e*f=17 and e +f= -2g.\n\nBut we also know that f = e +184.\n\nSo, from e*f=17 and f=e+184,\n\ne*(e +184)=17.\n\nWhich we solved earlier.\n\nSo, from that, e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nSo, e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17)]/2.\n\nWhich is e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)]/2.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, e = (-184 \u00b12*sqrt(8481))/2 = -92 \u00b1sqrt(8481).\n\nThus, e= -92 +sqrt(8481) or e=-92 -sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, CE= |107 -e|.\n\nSo, substituting e:\n\nCase 1: e= -92 +sqrt(8481).\n\nCE=107 - (-92 +sqrt(8481))=107 +92 -sqrt(8481)=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nCase 2: e= -92 -sqrt(8481).\n\nCE=107 - (-92 -sqrt(8481))=107 +92 +sqrt(8481)=199 +sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, we have two possible lengths: 199 -sqrt(8481) and 199 +sqrt(8481).\n\nBut sqrt(8481)=92.1 approximately.\n\nSo, 199 -92.1\u2248106.9,\n\n199 +92.1\u2248291.1.\n\nBut which one is the correct answer?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed so that CE is the shorter length, so 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut perhaps we can find an exact value.\n\nWait, 8481= 81*104.716... Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 8481 divided by 3 is 2827, as before. 2827=11*257.\n\nSo, 8481=3*11*257.\n\nBut that doesn't help in simplifying sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, perhaps the exact answer is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut wait, 199 is 107 +92, which are the lengths of AB and BC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the points are arranged such that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. So, E is between D(0,0) and C(107,0), so e is between 0 and107.\n\nBut in that case, e would be positive, and f = e +184 would be greater than 184, which is beyond C.\n\nBut in that case, CE=107 -e, which would be less than107.\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, e= -92 +sqrt(8481)\u22480.08, so CE\u2248107 -0.08\u2248106.92.\n\nBut perhaps the exact value is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, 199 -sqrt(8481)=199 -sqrt(3*11*257).\n\nHmm, but 199 is a prime number, I think.\n\nWait, 199 is a prime, yes.\n\nSo, perhaps the exact value is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find CE\u00b2.\n\nWait, CE\u00b2= (107 -e)^2.\n\nBut from e\u00b2 +184e -17=0, we have e\u00b2= -184e +17.\n\nSo, CE\u00b2= (107 -e)^2=107\u00b2 -2*107e +e\u00b2=107\u00b2 -214e + (-184e +17)=107\u00b2 +17 -398e.\n\nBut 398e= 398*(e).\n\nBut from e = (-184 \u00b1sqrt(33924))/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express e in terms of the quadratic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find CE in another way.\n\nWait, another approach: since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, perhaps we can use power of a point.\n\nPower of point C with respect to the circle.\n\nPoint C is at (107,0).\n\nPower of C with respect to the circle is equal to the product of distances from C to E and C to F, since E and F are points on the line DC.\n\nWait, power of a point formula: For a point P outside a circle, the power is equal to PA * PB, where PA and PB are lengths of tangents from P to the circle.\n\nBut in this case, since E and F are points on the line DC, which is the x-axis, and the circle passes through A, D, H, G.\n\nWait, perhaps the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CE * CF.\n\nBecause C lies on the line EF (which is the x-axis), and E and F are points where the line intersects the circle.\n\nWait, but A, D, H, G are on the circle, but E and F are not necessarily on the circle. Wait, E and F are points on the line DC, but not necessarily on the circle.\n\nWait, but A, D, H, G are on the circle. So, perhaps the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CE * CF.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the power of point C can be calculated as CA * CB, but that might not be the case.\n\nWait, power of a point C with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from C to the points of intersection of any line through C with the circle.\n\nIn this case, line CD passes through D and E and F.\n\nWait, but CD is the x-axis, and points D, E, C, F are on it.\n\nSo, the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CD * CE, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. The power of point C is equal to the product of the distances from C to the two intersection points on the line through C.\n\nBut in this case, the line through C is DC, which intersects the circle at D and another point?\n\nWait, point D is on the circle, and point C is outside the circle.\n\nSo, the power of point C is equal to CD * CE, where CE is the distance from C to E, but E is another intersection point.\n\nWait, but E is not on the circle, but on the line.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nThe power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to the square of the tangent from C to the circle.\n\nBut also, it's equal to CD * CE, where CD and CE are the lengths from C to D and E along the line.\n\nBut since D is on the circle, CD is the distance from C to D, which is 107 (since CD=AB=107).\n\nWait, no, CD is the distance from C to D, which is 107 units along the x-axis, as C is at (107,0) and D is at (0,0).\n\nWait, so CD is 107 units.\n\nBut CE is the distance from C to E, which is |107 - e|.\n\nSo, power of point C is CD * CE.\n\nBut power is also equal to the square of the tangent from C to the circle.\n\nSo, if I can compute the power of C in two ways, I can find CE.\n\nSo, let's compute the power of point C(107,0) with respect to the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17).\n\nThe power of C is equal to (distance from C to center)^2 - radius^2.\n\nAlternatively, it's equal to CA * CB? Wait, no, that's for another theorem.\n\nWait, the power of point C is equal to the product of the lengths from C to the two intersection points of any line through C with the circle.\n\nIn this case, line CD passes through D and E, but E is not on the circle. Wait, but D is on the circle.\n\nSo, the power of C is equal to CD * CE.\n\nBut since D is on the circle, CD is the length from C to D, which is 107, and CE is the length from C to E.\n\nBut E is another point on the line, but not on the circle.\n\nWait, no, because the line CD intersects the circle at D and another point, say, E'.\n\nBut in our problem, E is a point on the line, but not necessarily the intersection point.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the power of point C using coordinates.\n\nThe power of point C(107,0) with respect to the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx -16y=0 is:\n\nPower = (107)^2 + (0)^2 +2g*(107) -16*(0) =107\u00b2 +214g.\n\nBut power is also equal to CD * CE.\n\nBut CD is 107, CE is |107 - e|.\n\nSo,\n\n107\u00b2 +214g =107 * |107 - e|.\n\nBut from earlier, e +f = -2g, and e*f=17.\n\nBut f = e +184.\n\nSo, e + (e +184)= -2g => 2e +184= -2g => g= -e -92.\n\nSo, 2g= -2e -184.\n\nThus, power=107\u00b2 +214g=107\u00b2 +214*(-e -92).\n\nCompute:\n\n214*(-e -92)= -214e -214*92.\n\nCompute 214*92:\n\n200*92=18,400,\n\n14*92=1,288,\n\nTotal:18,400+1,288=19,688.\n\nSo,\n\nPower=107\u00b2 -214e -19,688.\n\nBut 107\u00b2=11,449.\n\nSo,\n\nPower=11,449 -214e -19,688= -8,239 -214e.\n\nBut power is also equal to CD * CE=107 * |107 - e|.\n\nSo,\n\n-8,239 -214e=107*(107 -e) or 107*(e -107).\n\nBut since power is positive (as point C is outside the circle), so we have:\n\n-8,239 -214e=107*(107 -e) if E is on one side, or 107*(e -107) if on the other.\n\nWait, let's compute both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: E is to the left of C.\n\nSo, CE=107 -e.\n\nBut since E is to the left, e <107.\n\nSo,\n\n-8,239 -214e=107*(107 -e).\n\nCompute RHS:107*(107 -e)=11,449 -107e.\n\nSo,\n\n-8,239 -214e=11,449 -107e.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-8,239 -214e -11,449 +107e=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-8,239 -11,449) + (-214e +107e)=0.\n\n-19,688 -107e=0.\n\nSo,\n\n-107e=19,688 => e= -19,688 /107.\n\nCompute 19,688 /107:\n\n107*184=107*(180+4)=107*180=19,260 +107*4=428=19,260+428=19,688.\n\nSo, 19,688 /107=184.\n\nThus, e= -184.\n\nSo, CE=107 -e=107 - (-184)=291.\n\nCase 2: E is to the right of C.\n\nSo, CE= e -107.\n\nBut since E is to the right, e>107.\n\nSo,\n\n-8,239 -214e=107*(e -107)=107e -11,449.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-8,239 -214e -107e +11,449=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n( -8,239 +11,449 ) + (-214e -107e )=0.\n\n3,210 -321e=0.\n\nSo,\n\n-321e= -3,210 => e= (-3,210)/(-321)=3,210/321.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n3,210 \u00f73=1,070.\n\n321 \u00f73=107.\n\nSo, e=1,070 /107=10.\n\nThus, e=10.\n\nSo, CE= e -107=10 -107= -97, but since it's a length, it's 97.\n\nWait, but this contradicts our earlier conclusion that e is either approximately 0.08 or -184.08.\n\nWait, so perhaps this approach gives us two possibilities: e=10 and e=-184.\n\nBut earlier, from the quadratic equation, e was either approximately 0.08 or -184.08.\n\nWait, this suggests that perhaps e=10 is another solution.\n\nBut why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the power of point C.\n\nWait, the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CA * CB, but that's for another theorem.\n\nWait, no, power of a point is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the intersection points of any line through the point and the circle.\n\nIn our case, the line through C is the x-axis, which intersects the circle at D and another point, say, E'.\n\nBut in the problem, E is a different point on the x-axis.\n\nSo, perhaps E' is different from E.\n\nWait, but in our problem, E is a point on the x-axis such that EFGH is a rectangle.\n\nSo, perhaps E is not the other intersection point of the x-axis with the circle.\n\nThus, perhaps my earlier approach using power of a point is not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that E is not on the circle, so the power of point C is not directly CE * CD.\n\nBut perhaps I can use coordinates to find the power.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17).\n\nSo, let me write down the general equation again.\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx +2hy +k=0.\n\nBut since D(0,0) is on the circle, substituting gives 0 +0 +0 +0 +k=0 =>k=0.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx +2hy=0.\n\nNow, plug in point A(0,16):\n\n0 + (16)^2 +0 +2h*(16)=0 =>256 +32h=0 =>h= -8.\n\nSo, equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx -16y=0.\n\nNow, plug in point H(e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (17)^2 +2g e -16*(17)=0.\n\nWhich is e\u00b2 +289 +2g e -272=0 => e\u00b2 +2g e +17=0.\n\nSimilarly, plug in point G(f,17):\n\nf\u00b2 +289 +2g f -272=0 =>f\u00b2 +2g f +17=0.\n\nSo, both e and f satisfy x\u00b2 +2g x +17=0.\n\nThus, as before, e +f= -2g,\n\ne*f=17.\n\nAnd we also have f = e +184.\n\nSo, substituting f= e +184 into e*f=17:\n\ne*(e +184)=17.\n\nSo, e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nWhich gives e= [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17)]/2.\n\nWhich is e= [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)]/2.\n\nWhich simplifies to e= -92 \u00b1sqrt(8481).\n\nThus, e= -92 +sqrt(8481) or e= -92 -sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, CE= |107 -e|.\n\nThus,\n\nIf e= -92 +sqrt(8481),\n\nCE=107 - (-92 +sqrt(8481))=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nIf e= -92 -sqrt(8481),\n\nCE=107 - (-92 -sqrt(8481))=199 +sqrt(8481).\n\nBut in the power of point approach, we found two possible e values: e=10 and e=-184.\n\nBut in reality, e must satisfy e*f=17 and f=e+184.\n\nSo, when e=10, f=194.\n\nThen, e*f=10*194=1,940\u226017. So, that's not possible.\n\nSimilarly, when e=-184, f= -184 +184=0.\n\nThen, e*f= -184*0=0\u226017.\n\nThus, these are not valid solutions.\n\nTherefore, the earlier approach via power of a point might have been incorrect because E is not the other intersection point of the x-axis with the circle.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct values are e= -92 \u00b1sqrt(8481), leading to CE=199 \u00b1sqrt(8481).\n\nBut since sqrt(8481)=sqrt(3*11*257), it doesn't simplify further.\n\nThus, the exact value is either 199 -sqrt(8481) or 199 +sqrt(8481).\n\nBut the problem is likely expecting the positive value, so perhaps 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut let me compute 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nSince sqrt(8481)\u224892.1,\n\n199 -92.1\u2248106.9.\n\nWhich is approximately 107, which makes sense if E is near D.\n\nBut perhaps the exact value is 107.\n\nWait, but from the quadratic equation, e= -92 +sqrt(8481).\n\nThus, CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut perhaps 199 -sqrt(8481)=107 -e.\n\nWait, e= -92 +sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, 107 -e=107 - (-92 +sqrt(8481))=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects an integer answer, given the lengths provided are integers.\n\nSo, perhaps sqrt(8481) is an integer.\n\nWait, 92^2=8464,\n\n93^2=8649.\n\nSo, 92^2=8464,\n\n92.05^2\u22488482.4.\n\nWhich is greater than 8481.\n\nSo, sqrt(8481) is not an integer.\n\nThus, perhaps the answer is 107.\n\nBut wait, in that case, CE=107 would imply that e=0, but e=0 is point D, which can't be because E is a distinct point.\n\nThus, perhaps the exact answer is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the power of point approach.\n\nWait, let me try again.\n\nPower of point C with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the distances from C to the points where any line through C intersects the circle.\n\nIn our case, line CD intersects the circle at D and another point, say, E'.\n\nBut in our problem, E is a different point on the line.\n\nThus, perhaps the power of point C is equal to CD * CE', where CE' is the distance from C to E'.\n\nBut since E is not E', perhaps this approach is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use coordinates to find the equation of the circle and then find CE.\n\nBut given the time I've spent, perhaps it's better to conclude that the length of CE is 107.\n\nBut wait, that can't be because e would have to be 0, which is point D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find CE using the fact that ADGH is cyclic.\n\nSo, quadrilateral ADGH is cyclic.\n\nPoints A(0,16), D(0,0), G(f,17), H(e,17).\n\nSo, the condition for cyclic quadrilateral is that the cross product is zero, i.e.,\n\n(Ax(Dy - Gy) + Dx(Gy - Hy) + Gx(Hy - Ay) + Hx(Ay - Dy))=0.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use slopes or perpendicular bisectors.\n\nAlternatively, the condition is that the power of point A with respect to the circle is zero.\n\nBut perhaps it's getting too complicated.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the length CE is 107.\n\nBut earlier calculations suggest it's approximately 106.9, which is close to 107.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value is 107.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, and points D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis.\n\nLet me consider the coordinates again.\n\nPoint D: (0,0),\n\nPoint C: (107,0),\n\nPoint E: (e,0),\n\nPoint F: (f,0),\n\nWith f =e +184,\n\ne*f=17.\n\nSo, from these, e*(e +184)=17,\n\ne\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17)]/2 = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)]/2.\n\nAs before.\n\nThus, CE= |107 -e|.\n\nSo, the exact value is |107 - [(-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924))/2 ]|.\n\nBut simplifying:\n\n107=214/2.\n\nSo,\n\nCE= | (214 - (-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)) ) /2 | = | (400 - sqrt(33924)) /2 |.\n\nWait,\n\nWait, 214/2=107,\n\nSo,\n\nCE= | (214 - (-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)) ) /2 | = | (214 +184 \u2213 sqrt(33924)) /2 |.\n\nWhich is | (398 \u2213 sqrt(33924)) /2 |.\n\nWhich is |199 \u2213 (sqrt(33924))/2 |.\n\nBut sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481).\n\nThus,\n\nCE= |199 \u2213 sqrt(8481)|.\n\nThus, CE=199 -sqrt(8481) or CE=199 +sqrt(8481).\n\nBut since sqrt(8481)=approx92.1,\n\nSo, 199 -92.1\u2248106.9,\n\n199 +92.1\u2248291.1.\n\nBut since the problem is likely expecting an integer, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, 92^2=8464,\n\n92.05^2=92^2 +2*92*0.05 +0.05^2=8464 +9.2 +0.0025=8473.2025.\n\nWait, 92.05^2=8473.2025,\n\n92.1^2=92^2 +2*92*0.1 +0.1^2=8464 +18.4 +0.01=8482.41.\n\nSo, 92.05^2=8473.2025,\n\n92.075^2= ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if 8481 is a multiple of any square.\n\nBut 8481=3*11*257, as before.\n\nThus, sqrt(8481)=sqrt(3*11*257).\n\nNo simplification possible.\n\nThus, the exact value is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects this as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut the problem is presented with integer lengths, so perhaps the answer is 107.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check with the power of point approach.\n\nEarlier, when I computed using power of point, I found e=10 and e=-184, but these don't satisfy e*f=17.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct answer is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut without more information, I can't be certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that CE is 107.\n\nBut I think the correct answer is 107.\n\nWait, but from the quadratic equation, e= -92 +sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nWhich is approximately 106.9, which is close to 107.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem expects CE=107.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the exact value as 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut since the problem is given with integer lengths, perhaps the answer is 107.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again.\n\nIt says: Rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear. Also, A,D,H,G all lie on a circle. If BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184, what is the length of CE?\n\nSo, all given lengths are integers, but the answer may not be.\n\nThus, perhaps the answer is 107.\n\nBut earlier calculation suggests 199 -sqrt(8481), which is approximately 106.9.\n\nBut 199 -sqrt(8481)=199 -92.096\u2248106.904.\n\nSo, approximately 106.904.\n\nBut the problem is likely expecting an exact value, so 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as 107 - e, where e= -92 +sqrt(8481).\n\nThus, CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, I think that's the exact value.\n\nThus, the answer is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to rationalize.\n\nWait, sqrt(8481)=sqrt(3*11*257).\n\nSo, 199 -sqrt(8481) is as simplified as it gets.\n\nThus, the length of CE is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut the problem may expect an integer, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 107.\n\nBut I think the exact value is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nThus, I'll conclude that.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given rectangles and the cyclic quadrilateral condition. Assigning coordinates to the points and using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and rectangles, we derive the length of CE through quadratic equations and geometric properties.\n\nThe length of CE is found to be:\n\n$\\boxed{199 - \\sqrt{8481}}$",
