      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway to (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit above (0, 1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.\n\nThe family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers. Since PQ has length 1, the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) must be 1. So, by the distance formula:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1 \u2192 p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nNow, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB itself. So, C is on AB, but no other PQ from F passes through C. We need to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.\n\nFirst, I should probably find the equation of the line AB.\n\nPoints A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the slope of AB.\n\nSlope m = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo the equation of AB is y - 0 = m(x - 1/2), which is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2).\n\nSimplify that: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo AB is the line y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, point C is on AB, so its coordinates satisfy that equation. Let me denote C as (x, y), so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need to find C such that it's not on any other PQ from F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F, which is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, the point C should not lie on that segment unless it's AB.\n\nSo, AB is one such segment. Let me check what AB's equation is as a segment. AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is a line segment with endpoints (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is part of the line y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, but only between x=0 and x=1/2.\n\nWait, but since C is on AB, and we need to find a point C that's not on any other PQ from F except AB, that means C can't lie on any other PQ segment from F. So, for any other PQ in F (i.e., any other segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1), C shouldn't lie on that segment.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model this as the point C being the intersection point of AB with some envelope of the family F, or perhaps it's the point where AB is tangent to some curve related to F.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the point where all the PQ segments from F are such that C is the only point on AB that's not on any other PQ except AB.\n\nHmm. Let me think about parametrizing the family F.\n\nEach PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, for any t in [0,1], a point on PQ can be written as (p(1 - t), q t). But wait, maybe it's better to parameterize the line PQ.\n\nThe equation of PQ can be written in intercept form: x/p + y/q = 1. Since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, this is a line with intercepts (p,0) and (0,q), and the segment lies in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, any point on PQ can be represented parametrically as (p(1 - s), q s), where s ranges from 0 to 1. When s=0, it's (p,0), and when s=1, it's (0,q).\n\nNow, point C is (x, y) on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. We need to find C such that for all other PQs in F, C is not on PQ. So, for any p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and (x, y) not equal to AB, (x, y) should not satisfy x/p + y/q =1.\n\nWait, but AB is itself a member of F because OA is (1/2, 0) and OB is (0, sqrt(3)/2), and (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, so AB is in F. So, AB is one of the segments in F.\n\nWe need to find a point C on AB that is not on any other segment in F.\n\nSo, for any other PQ in F (i.e., any other p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, not equal to (1/2,0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2)), the point C should not lie on PQ.\n\nSo, perhaps the point C is such that it's the only point on AB that lies on exactly one PQ from F, which is AB itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.\n\nWait, the family F consists of all lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. The envelope of such lines is the curve that is tangent to each line in the family. So, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.\n\nIf I can find the envelope, then the point C would be the point where AB touches this envelope. Then, since AB is part of F, the envelope would be tangent to AB at C, meaning that C is the only point where AB intersects the envelope, and hence, the only point on AB that is on another PQ from F would be C. But wait, the problem says that C doesn't belong to any other PQ except AB. So, if the envelope is the set of all PQs, then perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, meaning that for any other PQ, C is not on it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the envelope is another curve, and C is the point where AB meets this envelope, and thus, for all other PQs, C is not on them.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1, where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the condition that a line is tangent to a curve. For each line in the family, the envelope satisfies both the equation of the line and the derivative condition.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parameterize p and q. Since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, we can write p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is in (0, \u03c0/2), because p and q are positive.\n\nSo, each line is x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nNow, to find the envelope, we can consider this as a family of curves depending on \u03b8. The envelope satisfies the equation F(x, y, \u03b8) = 0 and dF/d\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, F(x, y, \u03b8) = x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) - 1 = 0.\n\nCompute dF/d\u03b8:\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = x * (sin\u03b8)/(cos\u00b2\u03b8) - y * (cos\u03b8)/(sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 0.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx * (sin\u03b8)/(cos\u00b2\u03b8) = y * (cos\u03b8)/(sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSimplify this:\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x = y * (cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8) = y cot^3\u03b8.\n\nNow, from F(x,y,\u03b8)=0:\n\nx/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nSubstitute x from above:\n\n(y cot^3\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny cot^3\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 = y (cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 = y cos\u00b2\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8.\n\nSo:\n\ny cos\u00b2\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nFactor y / sin\u03b8:\n\ny (cos\u00b2\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 1) =1.\n\nNote that cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\ny [ (1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8) / sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 1 ] =1.\n\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\n\n(1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 1 = (1/sin\u00b2\u03b8 -1) +1 = 1/sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\ny * (1/sin\u00b2\u03b8) =1 \u2192 y = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nFrom x = y cot^3\u03b8, and y = sin\u00b2\u03b8, so:\n\nx = sin\u00b2\u03b8 * (cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8) )= (sin\u00b2\u03b8)(cos^3\u03b8)/(sin^3\u03b8) )= cos^3\u03b8 / sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, x = cos^3\u03b8 / sin\u03b8, y = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWe can write parametric equations for the envelope:\n\nx = cos^3\u03b8 / sin\u03b8,\ny = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this in terms of a single parameter. Let me see if I can eliminate \u03b8.\n\nLet\u2019s denote t = sin\u03b8. Then, cos\u03b8 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nx = ( (1 - t\u00b2)^(3/2) ) / t,\ny = t\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but this might not be the easiest way to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can write x in terms of y.\n\nSince y = sin\u00b2\u03b8, let\u2019s let t = sin\u03b8. Then, y = t\u00b2, so t = sqrt(y).\n\nThen, cos\u03b8 = sqrt(1 - y).\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ (1 - y)^{3/2} ] / sqrt(y).\n\nSo, x = (1 - y)^{3/2} / y^{1/2}.\n\nSimplify this:\n\nx = (1 - y)^{3/2} / y^{1/2} = [ (1 - y)^3 / y ]^{1/2}.\n\nBut perhaps squaring both sides would help:\n\nx\u00b2 = (1 - y)^3 / y.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n(1 - y)^3 = 1 - 3y + 3y\u00b2 - y^3.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 y = 1 - 3y + 3y\u00b2 - y^3.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx\u00b2 y + y^3 -3y\u00b2 +3y -1 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe I can write this as x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think of this as a curve that the envelope forms. The envelope is given by x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nNow, the line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, to find the point C where AB is tangent to the envelope, we can substitute y from AB's equation into the envelope's equation and then impose that the system has exactly one solution, meaning the discriminant is zero.\n\nWait, but AB is a line in F, so perhaps it's tangent to the envelope at point C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps point C lies on both AB and the envelope, and the line AB is tangent to the envelope at C. So, substituting y from AB into the envelope equation should yield a quadratic equation with exactly one solution, which is point C.\n\nLet me proceed with that approach.\n\nSo, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the envelope equation x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = (1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ))^3.\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\nx\u00b2 (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = -sqrt(3) x^3 + (sqrt(3)/2) x^2.\n\nRight side:\n\n(1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 )^3.\n\nSimplify inside the cube:\n\n1 - sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)x.\n\nLet me write it as (sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ))^3.\n\nLet me compute this expansion.\n\nLet me denote a = sqrt(3), then the expression becomes (a x + (1 - a/2))^3.\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= (a x)^3 + 3(a x)^2 (1 - a/2) + 3(a x)(1 - a/2)^2 + (1 - a/2)^3.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. (a x)^3 = a^3 x^3 = (3 sqrt(3)) x^3.\n\n2. 3(a x)^2 (1 - a/2) = 3 a^2 x^2 (1 - a/2) = 3*(3) x^2 (1 - sqrt(3)/2) )= 9 x^2 (1 - sqrt(3)/2).\n\n3. 3(a x)(1 - a/2)^2 = 3a x [ (1 - a/2)^2 ] = 3a x [1 - a + (a^2)/4 ].\n\nSubstituting a = sqrt(3):\n\n= 3*sqrt(3) x [1 - sqrt(3) + (3)/4 ].\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 + 3/4 = 7/4. So,\n\n= 3*sqrt(3) x [7/4 - sqrt(3)].\n\n4. (1 - a/2)^3 = [1 - sqrt(3)/2]^3.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRight side becomes:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x^3 + 9(1 - sqrt(3)/2) x^2 + 3 sqrt(3)(7/4 - sqrt(3)) x + [1 - sqrt(3)/2]^3.\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\nLeft side = Right side:\n\n-sqrt(3) x^3 + (sqrt(3)/2) x^2 = 3 sqrt(3) x^3 + 9(1 - sqrt(3)/2) x^2 + 3 sqrt(3)(7/4 - sqrt(3)) x + [1 - sqrt(3)/2]^3.\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n-sqrt(3) x^3 + (sqrt(3)/2) x^2 - 3 sqrt(3) x^3 - 9(1 - sqrt(3)/2) x^2 - 3 sqrt(3)(7/4 - sqrt(3)) x - [1 - sqrt(3)/2]^3 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor x^3: (-sqrt(3) - 3 sqrt(3)) x^3 = -4 sqrt(3) x^3.\n\nFor x^2: (sqrt(3)/2 - 9(1 - sqrt(3)/2)) x^2.\n\nLet me compute the coefficient:\n\nsqrt(3)/2 -9 + (9 sqrt(3))/2 = (sqrt(3)/2 + 9 sqrt(3)/2) -9 = (10 sqrt(3)/2 ) -9 = 5 sqrt(3) -9.\n\nFor x term: -3 sqrt(3)(7/4 - sqrt(3)) x.\n\nCompute this:\n\n= -3 sqrt(3)*(7/4) + 3 sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)\n= (-21 sqrt(3)/4) + 9.\n\nConstant term: - [1 - sqrt(3)/2]^3.\n\nCompute [1 - sqrt(3)/2]^3:\n\n=1^3 - 3*1^2*(sqrt(3)/2) + 3*1*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)^3\n=1 - (3 sqrt(3))/2 + 3*(3/4) - (3 sqrt(3))/8\n=1 - (3 sqrt(3))/2 + 9/4 - (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= (1 + 9/4) + [ - (3 sqrt(3))/2 - (3 sqrt(3))/8 ]\n= 13/4 - (12 sqrt(3)/8 + 3 sqrt(3)/8 )\n= 13/4 - (15 sqrt(3)/8 ).\n\nSo, the constant term is - [13/4 - 15 sqrt(3)/8 ] = -13/4 + 15 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nPutting it all together, the equation becomes:\n\n-4 sqrt(3) x^3 + (5 sqrt(3) -9) x^2 - [21 sqrt(3)/4 -9] x + (-13/4 + 15 sqrt(3)/8 ) = 0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in x. Since AB is tangent to the envelope at point C, this equation should have a double root at x = x_C, meaning that the equation and its derivative both equal zero at x_C. Alternatively, perhaps the cubic will have exactly one real root, which is the point of tangency.\n\nBut solving this cubic equation might be complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps since AB is part of F, and the envelope is the curve tangent to all lines in F, then AB is one of those lines, so the point C is where AB touches the envelope, which would be a single point. So, maybe substituting y from AB into the envelope equation will give a quadratic equation in x, and the discriminant should be zero for tangency.\n\nWait, but earlier substitution led to a cubic equation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in that approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is a different curve.\n\nWait, another approach: the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. Let me consider using Lagrange multipliers to find the envelope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize p and q in terms of an angle. Since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, let me set p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0/2). Then, the line equation becomes x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nThe envelope is found by solving:\n\nF(x,y,\u03b8) = x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1 =0,\n\nand\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, from dF/d\u03b8=0,\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8:\n\nx sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x = y (cos\u00b3\u03b8 / sin\u00b3\u03b8) = y (cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8)^3 = y cot^3\u03b8.\n\nNow, substitute x into F(x,y,\u03b8)=0:\n\n(y cot^3\u03b8)/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny cot^3\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 = y (cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 = y cos\u00b2\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\ny cos\u00b2\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nFactor out y/sin\u03b8:\n\ny/sin\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 +1 )=1.\n\nSince cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\ncos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\ny/sin\u03b8 [ (1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 +1 ] =1.\n\nSimplify the bracket:\n\n(1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 +1 = (1/sin\u00b2\u03b8 -1) +1 = 1/sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\ny/sin\u03b8 * (1/sin\u00b2\u03b8) )= y/(sin^3\u03b8) =1 \u2192 y = sin^3\u03b8.\n\nFrom x = y cot^3\u03b8, and y = sin^3\u03b8,\n\nx = sin^3\u03b8 * (cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8 )= cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the envelope is parametrized by:\n\nx = cos^3\u03b8,\ny = sin^3\u03b8.\n\nThat's a familiar parametrization. So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nYes, because if x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8, then x^(2/3) = cos\u00b2\u03b8, y^(2/3) = sin\u00b2\u03b8, so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nNow, the problem is that the point C lies on AB and is also on the envelope (since AB is tangent to the envelope at C). So, substituting the equation of AB into the astroid equation will give the point C.\n\nSo, AB's equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSubstitute y into the astroid equation:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can find x by solving this equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the point of tangency by using the condition that AB is tangent to the astroid at C.\n\nThe astroid can be written as x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nTo find the tangent line to the astroid at a point (x0, y0), the equation is given by:\n\n( x0 )^{-1/3} x + ( y0 )^{-1/3} y =1.\n\nWait, let me recall: the derivative of the astroid is dy/dx = - (y)^(1/3) / (x)^(1/3).\n\nWait, let me compute it properly.\n\nDifferentiating x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1 implicitly with respect to x:\n\n(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0 \u2192 dy/dx = - [ x^(-1/3) ] / [ y^(-1/3) ] = - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at (x0, y0) is m = - (y0^(1/3))/(x0^(1/3)).\n\nBut we know that the line AB has slope -sqrt(3). So, at the point C, the tangent to the astroid must have slope -sqrt(3). So,\n\n- (y0^(1/3))/(x0^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3) \u2192 (y0^(1/3))/(x0^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\n(y0)/(x0) = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y0 = 3 sqrt(3) x0.\n\nBut wait, point C lies on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, y0 = -sqrt(3) x0 + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBut we also have y0 = 3 sqrt(3) x0 from the slope condition.\n\nSo, equate the two expressions for y0:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x0 = -sqrt(3) x0 + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x0 + sqrt(3) x0 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x0 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4 x0 = 1/2 \u2192 x0 = 1/8.\n\nSo, x0 = 1/8.\n\nThen, y0 = 3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nNow, we can check if this point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x0^(2/3) + y0^(2/3):\n\n(1/8)^(2/3) + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) = 1/(4), since 8^(1/3)=2, so 8^(2/3)=4.\n\nSimilarly, (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3) = [3^(3/2)/8]^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / 8^(2/3) )= 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) /4 = 3^1 /4 = 3/4.\n\nSo, x0^(2/3) + y0^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, which satisfies the astroid equation. Good.\n\nNow, since point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8), we can compute OC\u00b2.\n\nOC is the distance from O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8), so:\n\nOC\u00b2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + (27)/64 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, 1 + 27 is 28, so 28/64 reduces to 7/16. So, OC\u00b2 =7/16.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that C is on AB, which is part of F, but does it lie on any other PQ from F? Since it's on the envelope, which is the astroid, which is the set of points where each PQ is tangent. So, perhaps C is only on AB and the envelope, but not on any other PQ. So, OC\u00b2 is 7/16, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that point C is indeed the only point on AB that's not on any other PQ from F. Since AB is part of F, and C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope (the astroid), then any other PQ from F would intersect AB only at C, if at all. But since the astroid is the envelope, perhaps C is the only point where AB and another PQ from F meet, which is just at C. So, point C is on AB and on the envelope, so it's on AB and on the tangent line at C, which is AB itself. So, perhaps C is only on AB and no other PQ. Thus, OC\u00b2=7/16, so the answer is 7+16=23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the equation of line AB. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, \u221a3/2) give a slope of -\u221a3, leading to the equation y = -\u221a3x + \u221a3/2.\n\nNext, we consider the family of segments PQ with P(p, 0) and Q(0, q) such that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. These segments form the lines x/p + y/q = 1. The envelope of this family is found by solving for the condition that each line is tangent to a curve. Using parametrization with p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, the envelope is identified as the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThe point C lies on both AB and the astroid. Substituting y = -\u221a3x + \u221a3/2 into the astroid equation, we solve for x and y. By equating the slope of AB to the derivative of the astroid at C, we find x = 1/8 and y = 3\u221a3/8.\n\nFinally, the distance OC\u00b2 is calculated as (1/8)\u00b2 + (3\u221a3/8)\u00b2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Thus, OC\u00b2 = 7/16, and the sum of p and q is 7 + 16 = 23.\n\n**Answer:** 23",
