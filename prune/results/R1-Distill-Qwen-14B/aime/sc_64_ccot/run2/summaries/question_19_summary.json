      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the product AB times AC in triangle ABC. The problem states that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Hmm, that's quite a setup.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic definitions. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, while the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that gives me a right angle at I between IA and OI. So, triangle AIO is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at I. That might come in handy later.\n\nI remember there are some formulas that relate the sides of a triangle to the inradius and circumradius. One of them is the formula for the area, which can be expressed as r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Another is the formula involving the sides and the circumradius: a = 2R * sin A, and similarly for the other sides.\n\nWait, but I need to find AB * AC. Let's denote AB as c and AC as b, following the standard notation where a is BC, b is AC, and c is AB. So, I'm looking for b * c.\n\nI also remember that in any triangle, the product of the sides can be related to the area and the circumradius. The formula for the area is (a*b*c)/(4R). So, if I can find the area, I can express b*c in terms of the area and R.\n\nBut I also know that the area is r*s, where r is 6 and s is the semi-perimeter. So, area = 6s. Therefore, 6s = (a*b*c)/(4*13). That simplifies to 6s = (a*b*c)/52, so a*b*c = 312s. Hmm, but I don't know a, b, c, or s yet.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find b*c, so maybe I can express a in terms of other variables. Alternatively, perhaps I can find s in terms of other quantities.\n\nLet me think about the given condition: IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A, right? Wait, no, IA is the length from the incenter I to vertex A. Similarly, OI is the distance between the incenter and circumradius. \n\nI remember there's a formula that relates OI, the distance between incenter and circumcenter, to other triangle parameters. The formula is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Let me check if that's correct. Yeah, I think that's right. So, OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r).\n\nGiven R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI\u00b2: 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, that's useful.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle AIO is right-angled at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras' theorem, AI\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nBut what is AO? AO is the distance from the circumcenter to vertex A. In a triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is just the circumradius, right? Because all vertices lie on the circumcircle. So AO = R = 13.\n\nSo, AI\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2 becomes AI\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13\u00b2. That is AI\u00b2 + 13 = 169. So AI\u00b2 = 156. Therefore, AI = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So AI = 2\u221a39.\n\nNow, I remember that the length of the inradius can be related to AI. Wait, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but AI is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. There's a formula for AI in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. \n\nI think AI = r / sin(A/2). Let me confirm that. Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by AI = r / sin(A/2). So, AI = 6 / sin(A/2). But earlier, we found AI = 2\u221a39. Therefore, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39. Solving for sin(A/2): sin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = \u221a39 / 13. Wait, because 3 / \u221a39 is equal to (3\u221a39)/39 = \u221a39 / 13. So, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13.\n\nFrom sin(A/2), I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1. So, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. Since A is an angle in a triangle, A/2 is acute, so cos is positive.\n\nNow, what can I do with sin(A/2) and cos(A/2)? Well, I know that the area can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semi-perimeter: area = r*s = 6s. Also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*ab*sin C, but maybe a better approach is to use the formula involving the sides and angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the sides in terms of the angles. Since a = 2R sin A, and similarly for b and c.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for b*c. Let's see, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C. So, b*c = 4R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nBut I need to relate this to known quantities. Let's think about the angles. In triangle ABC, A + B + C = \u03c0. So, maybe we can express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find angle A first. Since I have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), I can find sin A. Because sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2). So, sin A = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/169. Let me compute 39*130. 39*130 = 5070. So, \u221a5070. Hmm, but 5070 factors into 10*507, and 507 is 13*39, so 5070 = 10*13*39 = 2*5*13*3*13. Wait, that's 2*3*5*13\u00b2. So, sqrt(5070) = 13*sqrt(30). Because 5070 = 13\u00b2 * 30.\n\nSo, sqrt(5070) = 13\u221a30. Therefore, sin A = 2*(13\u221a30)/169 = (26\u221a30)/169 = (2\u221a30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13. Now, since a = 2R sin A, a = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 2*2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, that gives me side a, which is BC. So, a = 4\u221a30.\n\nNow, let's think about the semi-perimeter s. The semi-perimeter is (a + b + c)/2. But I don't know b or c yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, I can relate the sides using the formula for the area. The area is 6s, as mentioned earlier. Also, the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13). Simplifying, 6s = (b*c * \u221a30)/13.\n\nBut I need another equation to relate s and b*c. Maybe using the law of cosines or some other identity.\n\nWait, let's recall that in a triangle, (b + c)^2 = a^2 + 2bc cos A. Since I know a and sin A, and I can find cos A.\n\nWe have sin A = 2\u221a30/13. So, cos A = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2A) = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169) = sqrt(1 - 120/169) = sqrt(49/169) = 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nThen, (b + c)^2 = a^2 + 2bc cos A.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n(b + c)^2 = (4\u221a30)^2 + 2*b*c*(7/13)\n= 16*30 + (14/13)*b*c\n= 480 + (14/13)bc.\n\nBut (b + c)^2 is also equal to (b + c)^2 = (2s - a)^2, since s = (a + b + c)/2, so b + c = 2s - a.\n\nSo, (2s - a)^2 = 480 + (14/13)bc.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(2s - 4\u221a30)^2 = 480 + (14/13)bc.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n4s\u00b2 - 16\u221a30 s + (4\u221a30)^2 = 4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s + 480.\n\nSo,\n\n4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s + 480 = 480 + (14/13)bc.\n\nSubtracting 480 from both sides:\n\n4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s = (14/13) bc.\n\nBut earlier, from the area:\n\n6s = (bc * \u221a30)/13.\n\nLet me solve for bc:\n\nbc = (6s *13)/\u221a30 = (78 s)/\u221a30.\n\nSo, plug this into the equation:\n\n4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s = (14/13) * (78 s)/\u221a30.\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(14/13)*(78 s)/\u221a30 = (14 * 6 s)/\u221a30 = (84 s)/\u221a30.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s = (84 s)/\u221a30.\n\nLet's multiply both sides by \u221a30 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n4s\u00b2\u221a30 - 16*30 s = 84 s.\n\nSimplify 16*30: 480.\n\nSo,\n\n4\u221a30 s\u00b2 - 480 s = 84 s.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n4\u221a30 s\u00b2 - 480 s -84 s = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4\u221a30 s\u00b2 - 564 s = 0.\n\nFactor out s:\n\ns (4\u221a30 s - 564) = 0.\n\nSo, either s = 0, which isn't possible, or:\n\n4\u221a30 s - 564 = 0.\n\nSolving for s:\n\n4\u221a30 s = 564\n\ns = 564 / (4\u221a30) = 141 / \u221a30.\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\ns = (141\u221a30)/30 = 47\u221a30 / 10.\n\nSo, s = 47\u221a30 /10.\n\nNow, from the area formula, 6s = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nWe have s = 47\u221a30 /10, so 6s = 6*(47\u221a30)/10 = (282\u221a30)/10 = (141\u221a30)/5.\n\nSetting this equal to (b c \u221a30)/13:\n\n(141\u221a30)/5 = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nWe can cancel \u221a30 from both sides:\n\n141/5 = bc /13.\n\nSolving for bc:\n\nbc = (141/5)*13 = (141*13)/5.\n\nCalculate 141 *13: 140*13=1820, plus 1*13=13, so 1833.\n\nSo, bc = 1833/5 = 366.6.\n\nWait, but 1833 divided by 5 is 366.6, but I think it's better to keep it as a fraction. So, 1833/5.\n\nBut wait, 141 and 13: 141 is 3*47, 13 is prime, so no simplification. So, 141*13 = 1833. Therefore, bc = 1833/5.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for AB * AC, which is bc. So, is 1833/5 the answer? Hmm, that's 366.6, but let me check if I made any calculation errors.\n\nWait, let me retrace. So, from 6s = (bc\u221a30)/13, and s =47\u221a30/10.\n\nSo, 6*(47\u221a30/10) = (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nCompute 6*(47\u221a30)/10: (282\u221a30)/10 = (141\u221a30)/5.\n\nSet equal to (bc\u221a30)/13:\n\n(141\u221a30)/5 = (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nCancel \u221a30:\n\n141/5 = bc/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\nbc = (141 *13)/5 = 1833/5.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, bc is 1833/5. Which is 366.6, but as a fraction, 1833/5 is the exact value.\n\nBut let me see if this fraction can be simplified. 1833 divided by 5 is 366.6, which is 366 and 3/5. Since 1833 and 5 have no common factors besides 1, that's the simplest form.\n\nWait a second, but 1833 divided by 3 is 611, which is 13*47. So, 1833 = 3*13*47, and 5 is prime, so no, nothing cancels.\n\nSo, the product AB * AC is 1833/5.\n\nWait, but the problem states the answer should be an integer. Hmm, but 1833 divided by 5 is 366.6, which is not an integer. That suggests I might have made a mistake in my calculations somewhere.\n\nLet me go back and check each step.\n\nStarting from the top: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13-12) =13, so OI = sqrt(13). Correct.\n\nThen, in triangle AIO, right-angled at I, so AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nAO is the circumradius, 13, so AI\u00b2 +13 = 169 => AI\u00b2=156 => AI=2\u221a39. Correct.\n\nThen, AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2) =2\u221a39. So, sin(A/2)=6/(2\u221a39)=3/\u221a39=\u221a39/13. Correct.\n\nThen, cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 - (39/169))=sqrt(130/169)=sqrt(130)/13. Correct.\n\nThen, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13)=2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\nWait, 39*130=5070, which factors into 2*3*5*13\u00b2. So, sqrt(5070)=13*sqrt(30). So, sin A=2*(13\u221a30)/169= (26\u221a30)/169= (2\u221a30)/13. Correct.\n\nThen, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30. Correct.\n\nThen, area =6s, and area=(1/2)*b*c*sin A= (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13)= (b c \u221a30)/13. So, 6s= (b c \u221a30)/13. Correct.\n\nThen, using the law of cosines: (b + c)^2 = a^2 + 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a=4\u221a30, so a\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\ncos A = sqrt(1 - (2\u221a30/13)^2)=sqrt(1 - 4*30/169)=sqrt(1 - 120/169)=sqrt(49/169)=7/13. Correct.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2=480 + 2bc*(7/13)=480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nBut (b + c)^2=(2s - a)^2=4s\u00b2 -4s a +a\u00b2.\n\nSo, 4s\u00b2 -4s a + a\u00b2=480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nPlugging in a=4\u221a30, a\u00b2=480, so:\n\n4s\u00b2 -4s*(4\u221a30) +480 =480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s +480=480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nSubtract 480:\n\n4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s= (14/13) bc.\n\nFrom area, 6s= (b c \u221a30)/13 => bc= (6s *13)/\u221a30=78 s /\u221a30. Correct.\n\nSo, plug bc=78 s /\u221a30 into the equation:\n\n4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s= (14/13)*(78 s /\u221a30).\n\nSimplify right side:\n\n(14/13)*(78/\u221a30)s= (14*6 /\u221a30)s=84 s /\u221a30.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s=84 s /\u221a30.\n\nMultiply both sides by \u221a30:\n\n4s\u00b2\u221a30 -16*30 s=84 s.\n\nWhich is:\n\n4\u221a30 s\u00b2 -480 s=84 s.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n4\u221a30 s\u00b2 -480 s -84 s=0 => 4\u221a30 s\u00b2 -564 s=0.\n\nFactor s:\n\ns(4\u221a30 s -564)=0.\n\nSolutions: s=0 (invalid) or 4\u221a30 s=564 => s=564/(4\u221a30)=141/\u221a30= (141\u221a30)/30=47\u221a30/10. Correct.\n\nSo, s=47\u221a30/10.\n\nThen, bc= (78 s)/\u221a30= (78*(47\u221a30/10))/\u221a30= (78*47\u221a30)/(10\u221a30)= (78*47)/10= (3666)/10=366.6= 1833/5.\n\nHmm, same as before. So, bc=1833/5. Which is 366.6.\n\nBut the problem says to give an integer answer, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the formula for AI. Let me double-check that. AI is the distance from the incenter to vertex A, and the formula is AI = r / sin(A/2). Is that correct?\n\nWait, actually, I think the correct formula is AI = r / sin(A/2). Let me verify.\n\nYes, according to standard triangle formulas, the distance from the inradius to a vertex is indeed given by AI = r / sin(A/2). So that part was correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should use vector methods or coordinate geometry. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system could help, but that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating OI\u00b2. Wait, OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So, OI\u00b2=13*(13-12)=13. Correct.\n\nThen, AO is R, so AO=13. Then, AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2= AO\u00b2 => AI\u00b2=169 -13=156. Correct.\n\nSo, AI=2\u221a39. Then, AI= r / sin(A/2)=6 / sin(A/2)=2\u221a39. So, sin(A/2)=6/(2\u221a39)=3/\u221a39=\u221a39/13. Correct.\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13, so cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 - 39/169)=sqrt(130/169)=\u221a130/13. Correct.\n\nThen, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13)=2*sqrt(39*130)/169=2*sqrt(5070)/169. Wait, 39*130=5070, which is 13\u00b2 *30, so sqrt(5070)=13\u221a30. So, sin A=2*(13\u221a30)/169=26\u221a30/169=2\u221a30/13. Correct.\n\nSo, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30. Correct.\n\nThen, area=6s, area=(1/2)*b*c*sin A= (b c \u221a30)/13. So, 6s= (b c \u221a30)/13 => bc= (6s *13)/\u221a30=78 s /\u221a30. Correct.\n\nThen, using the law of cosines, I arrived at bc=1833/5.\n\nWait, but 1833/5 is 366.6, which is not an integer. The problem says to put the answer in a box, implying it's an integer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the process.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I should use the formula for the product bc in terms of other parameters. Let me think.\n\nI also know that in a triangle, the product bc can be expressed as 2R * (area) / a. Wait, let's see.\n\nThe area is (1/2)*a*h, where h is the height. But perhaps another approach: since area = (a*b*c)/(4R), and area=6s.\n\nSo, 6s = (a b c)/(4R). We have a=4\u221a30, R=13.\n\nSo, 6s = (4\u221a30 * b * c)/(4*13) => 6s = (\u221a30 * b c)/13.\n\nWhich gives bc= (6s *13)/\u221a30=78 s /\u221a30. Which is what I had before. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, but I also know that s = (a + b + c)/2. So, s = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, but I don't know b + c yet.\n\nWait, from the equation earlier: (b + c)^2 =480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nBut (b + c)=2s - a=2*(47\u221a30/10) -4\u221a30= (94\u221a30/10) -4\u221a30= (94\u221a30/10 -40\u221a30/10)=54\u221a30/10=27\u221a30/5.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2=(27\u221a30/5)^2= (729*30)/25=21870/25=874.8.\n\nBut from the earlier equation, (b + c)^2=480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, 874.8=480 + (14/13)*bc.\n\nCompute (14/13)*bc=874.8 -480=394.8.\n\nSo, bc= (394.8)*(13/14).\n\nCalculate 394.8 *13=5132.4, then divide by14: 5132.4 /14=366.6. Which is 1833/5. Same result.\n\nSo, seems consistent.\n\nBut the problem is expecting an integer, so perhaps I messed up some calculation. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied a formula.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe using the formula that relates AI, IO, and other elements.\n\nWait, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle AIO is right-angled at I, so AI is perpendicular to OI.\n\nI also know that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI=\u221a(R(R-2r))=\u221a13 as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps another formula: In triangle AIO, AI is perpendicular to OI, so the area is (AI * OI)/2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinate geometry. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place the incenter I at the origin (0,0). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is the line connecting O to I, which is the origin. Wait, if I is at (0,0), then O is at some point (h,k), and IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nBut IA is the line from I (0,0) to A, which is some point (x,y). So, vector IA is (x,y), and vector OI is (h,k). Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, x*h + y*k=0.\n\nBut O is the circumcenter, which is at (h,k). The circumradius is 13, so the distance from O to A is 13. So, (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 =13^2=169.\n\nAlso, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I (0,0) to BC is 6. But without knowing the coordinates of B and C, this might get too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set up the triangle such that point A is at (0, b), point B at (-c,0), and point C at (d,0). But that might complicate things further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that in triangle ABC, AI is perpendicular to OI. So, the vectors AI and OI are perpendicular. Let me denote vectors.\n\nLet me denote vector AI as from I to A, which is (A - I). Similarly, vector OI is from I to O, which is (O - I). Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero: (A - I) \u00b7 (O - I) =0.\n\nBut without knowing the coordinates, this might not help directly.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think my initial approach was correct, and the answer is bc=1833/5, which is 366.6. But since the problem expects an integer, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for AI.\n\nWait, let me check another formula for AI. I found AI = r / sin(A/2). But perhaps another formula is AI = (r)/sin(A/2). Alternatively, AI can be expressed as 2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2). Wait, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another formula: AI = (r)/(sin(A/2)) is correct. Let me confirm from standard triangle formulas.\n\nYes, AI = r / sin(A/2). So, that was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector. Wait, but that's more complicated.\n\nWait, another idea: using the formula that relates the inradius, circumradius, and the distance between incenter and circumradius.\n\nWe have OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nWait, wait, earlier I used OI\u00b2=R(R - 2r). Which is the same as R\u00b2 -2Rr. So, that's correct.\n\nGiven R=13, r=6, OI\u00b2=13\u00b2 -2*13*6=169 -156=13. So, OI=\u221a13. Correct.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nWait, another formula: in triangle AIO, right-angled at I, so AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2= AO\u00b2.\n\nAO is the distance from A to O, which is the circumradius, so 13. So, AI\u00b2 +13=169 => AI\u00b2=156 => AI=2\u221a39. Correct.\n\nThen, AI= r / sin(A/2) => 2\u221a39=6 / sin(A/2) => sin(A/2)=6/(2\u221a39)=3/\u221a39=\u221a39/13. Correct.\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13, cos(A/2)=\u221a130/13. Then, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13)=2*sqrt(5070)/169=2*13\u221a30/169=2\u221a30/13. Correct.\n\nSo, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30. Correct.\n\nThen, area=6s, area=(1/2)*b*c*sin A= (b c \u221a30)/13. So, 6s=(b c \u221a30)/13 => bc=78 s /\u221a30. Correct.\n\nThen, using the law of cosines, (b + c)^2= a\u00b2 + 2 bc cos A=480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nBut (b + c)^2=(2s -a)^2=4s\u00b2 -4s a +a\u00b2=4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s +480. Correct.\n\nSetting equal: 4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s +480=480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nSubtract 480:4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s=(14/13) bc.\n\nSubstitute bc=78 s /\u221a30:4s\u00b2 -16\u221a30 s= (14/13)*(78 s /\u221a30)=84 s /\u221a30.\n\nMultiply both sides by \u221a30:4\u221a30 s\u00b2 -480 s=84 s.\n\nBring all terms to left:4\u221a30 s\u00b2 -564 s=0 => s(4\u221a30 s -564)=0.\n\nThus, s=564/(4\u221a30)=141/\u221a30=47\u221a30/10. Correct.\n\nThen, bc=78 s /\u221a30=78*(47\u221a30/10)/\u221a30=78*47/10= (78*47)/10= (3666)/10=366.6=1833/5.\n\nHmm, seems correct, but the problem expects an integer. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the formula for AI.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should use the formula for AI in terms of the sides.\n\nI found AI = r / sin(A/2), but another formula for AI is AI = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nAlternatively, AI can be expressed as 2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2). Wait, let me check that.\n\nYes, in triangle ABC, AI = 2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2). So, AI=2*13*sin(B/2) sin(C/2)=26 sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nBut we have AI=2\u221a39, so 26 sin(B/2) sin(C/2)=2\u221a39.\n\nThus, sin(B/2) sin(C/2)= (2\u221a39)/26=\u221a39/13.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe.\n\nAlso, in triangle ABC, B + C=\u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, let me denote D = B/2 and E = C/2. So, D + E = (\u03c0 - A)/2.\n\nWe have sin D sin E=\u221a39/13.\n\nAlso, from the formula, sin D sin E= [cos(D - E) - cos(D + E)] /2.\n\nSo, [cos(D - E) - cos(D + E)] /2=\u221a39/13.\n\nBut D + E=(\u03c0 - A)/2, which we can compute.\n\nFrom earlier, we have angle A, with sin A=2\u221a30/13, cos A=7/13.\n\nSo, A=arcsin(2\u221a30/13). Let me compute A in terms of degrees to get an idea.\n\nBut maybe not necessary. Let's see.\n\ncos(D + E)=cos( (\u03c0 - A)/2 )=sin(A/2). Because cos(\u03c0/2 - x)=sin x.\n\nSo, cos(D + E)=sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13.\n\nSo, back to the equation:\n\n[cos(D - E) - sin(A/2)] /2=\u221a39/13.\n\nPlugging in sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13:\n\n[cos(D - E) - \u221a39/13]/2=\u221a39/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\ncos(D - E) - \u221a39/13=2\u221a39/13.\n\nSo, cos(D - E)= (2\u221a39/13) + (\u221a39/13)=3\u221a39/13.\n\nSo, cos(D - E)=3\u221a39/13.\n\nBut cos(theta) can't exceed 1. Let's compute 3\u221a39/13.\n\n\u221a39\u22486.245, so 3*6.245\u224818.735. Divided by13\u22481.441.\n\nBut cos(theta) cannot be more than 1. So, 3\u221a39/13\u22481.441>1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, that suggests a contradiction. So, my calculation must be wrong somewhere.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, AI=2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2). Let me confirm that formula.\n\nYes, AI = 2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2). So, AI=26 sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nEarlier, I had AI=2\u221a39, so 26 sin(B/2) sin(C/2)=2\u221a39 => sin(B/2) sin(C/2)= (2\u221a39)/26=\u221a39/13\u22480.485.\n\nBut when I tried to express it using the identity, I ended up with cos(D - E)=3\u221a39/13\u22481.441>1, which is impossible. So, that suggests an error in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I used for sin D sin E is incorrect. Let me check.\n\nThe identity is sin D sin E = [cos(D - E) - cos(D + E)] /2. Correct.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n[cos(D - E) - cos(D + E)] /2=\u221a39/13.\n\nWe have cos(D + E)=cos( (\u03c0 - A)/2 )=sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13.\n\nSo,\n\n[cos(D - E) - \u221a39/13 ] /2=\u221a39/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\ncos(D - E) - \u221a39/13=2\u221a39/13.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(D - E)=2\u221a39/13 +\u221a39/13=3\u221a39/13\u22481.441.\n\nWhich is greater than 1, impossible.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong, which is conflicting.\n\nWait, but earlier steps were correct. So, perhaps the problem is that AI is not equal to 2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2), but something else.\n\nWait, let me double-check the formula for AI.\n\nUpon checking, the correct formula is AI = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nAnother formula is AI = 2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2). So, both should be equal.\n\nSo, 2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2)= r / sin(A/2).\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n2*13 sin(B/2) sin(C/2)=6 / (\u221a39/13).\n\nSo, 26 sin(B/2) sin(C/2)=6*13/\u221a39=78/\u221a39=78\u221a39/39=2\u221a39.\n\nThus,\n\n26 sin(B/2) sin(C/2)=2\u221a39 => sin(B/2) sin(C/2)= (2\u221a39)/26=\u221a39/13\u22480.485.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. So, no problem here.\n\nThen, using the identity sin(B/2) sin(C/2)= [cos(B/2 - C/2) - cos(B/2 + C/2)] /2= [cos((B - C)/2) - cos((B + C)/2)] /2.\n\nBut (B + C)/2= (\u03c0 - A)/2= \u03c0/2 - A/2.\n\nSo, cos((B + C)/2)=sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13.\n\nThus,\n\n[cos((B - C)/2) - \u221a39/13]/2=\u221a39/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\ncos((B - C)/2) - \u221a39/13=2\u221a39/13.\n\nSo,\n\ncos((B - C)/2)=2\u221a39/13 +\u221a39/13=3\u221a39/13\u22481.441.\n\nAgain, impossible. So, cos(theta) cannot exceed 1. So, something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I used AI = 2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2). Let me check a reliable source.\n\nUpon checking, the formula is AI = (r)/(sin(A/2)). So, AI=6/(\u221a39/13)=6*13/\u221a39=78/\u221a39=78\u221a39/39=2\u221a39. Correct.\n\nAnother formula: AI= (4Rr)/(b + c). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's the formula for the length of the angle bisector. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, another formula: AI= (r)/(sin(A/2))= (4R sin(B/2) sin(C/2)).\n\nWait, from the formula AI = r / sin(A/2) and AI=2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2). So, equate them:\n\n2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2)= r / sin(A/2).\n\nWhich is what I did earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nBut when I try to compute sin(B/2) sin(C/2)=\u221a39/13, which when plugged into the identity, leads to an impossible cosine value. So, perhaps the problem is in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating AI. Wait, AI is the distance from incenter I to vertex A, which is given by AI = r / sin(A/2). So, with r=6 and sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13, AI=6/(\u221a39/13)=78/\u221a39=2\u221a39. Correct.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that AI is not perpendicular to OI, but rather, IA is perpendicular to OI. Wait, but IA is the same as AI. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the triangle is such that angle A is obtuse, making some lengths negative or something. But in reality, lengths are positive.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the triangle is not possible with the given conditions. But the problem states it exists, so it must be possible.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think my initial approach is correct, and the answer is bc=1833/5. But since the problem asks for an integer, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the answer is 1833/5, which is 366.6, but as a fraction, it's 1833/5.\n\nWait, 1833 divided by 5 is 366.6, which is 366 and 3/5. But the problem might expect the answer as a fraction, so 1833/5.\n\nWait, but 1833 and 5: 1833 \u00f73=611, 611 \u00f713=47. So, 1833=3*13*47. 5 is prime, so no simplification. So, 1833/5 is the simplest form.\n\nWait, but the problem says to put the answer in a box, so maybe I should write it as 1833/5. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is 366.6, but I'll check once more.\n\nWait, let me compute 47\u221a30/10:\n\n\u221a30\u22485.477, so 47*5.477\u2248258.419. Divided by10\u224825.8419. So, s\u224825.8419.\n\nThen, bc=78*s/\u221a30\u224878*25.8419/5.477\u224878*4.714\u2248367. So, approximately 367, which is close to 366.6. So, perhaps the exact value is 1833/5, which is 366.6.\n\nBut the problem expects an integer, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the answer is 1833/5.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the product bc in terms of the sides.\n\nI know that a=4\u221a30, and the semi-perimeter s=47\u221a30/10.\n\nSo, the sides are a=4\u221a30, b, c.\n\ns=(a + b + c)/2=47\u221a30/10.\n\nSo, a + b + c=2s=47\u221a30/5.\n\nSo, b + c=47\u221a30/5 -4\u221a30= (47\u221a30 -20\u221a30)/5=27\u221a30/5.\n\nSo, b + c=27\u221a30/5.\n\nWe also have bc=1833/5.\n\nSo, we can consider b and c as roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - (b + c)x + bc=0.\n\nWhich is x\u00b2 - (27\u221a30/5)x + 1833/5=0.\n\nBut I don't think that helps me directly.\n\nWait, perhaps using Heron's formula. The area is sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nBut I don't know b and c, so that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates the inradius, area, and semi-perimeter.\n\nArea= r*s=6*(47\u221a30/10)=282\u221a30/10=141\u221a30/5.\n\nAlso, area= (1/2)*b*c*sin A= (1/2)*bc*(2\u221a30/13)= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nSet equal: (bc\u221a30)/13=141\u221a30/5.\n\nCancel \u221a30: bc/13=141/5 => bc= (141*13)/5=1833/5.\n\nSame result. So, I think this is correct.\n\nThus, despite the answer not being an integer, I think 1833/5 is the correct value for AB * AC.\n\nBut the problem says to put the answer in a box, implying it's an integer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express bc=1833/5 as 366.6, but that's not an integer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer as a fraction, so 1833/5.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating bc=78 s /\u221a30.\n\ns=47\u221a30/10.\n\nSo, 78*s=78*(47\u221a30/10)= (78*47\u221a30)/10.\n\n78*47: 70*47=3290, 8*47=376, total=3290+376=3666.\n\nSo, 78*s=3666\u221a30/10=3666\u221a30/10.\n\nDivide by \u221a30: bc=3666\u221a30/(10\u221a30)=3666/10=366.6=1833/5.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 1833/5, which is 366.6. But since the problem expects an integer, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different definition or I misapplied a formula. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 1833/5, which is 366.6, but I'll proceed with that.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) has circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and inradius \\( r = 6 \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has its circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. Interesting condition. I need to find the product of sides AB and AC, which is AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic properties and formulas related to triangle centers and inradius and circumradius.\n\nI know that the circumradius R of a triangle is related to its sides a, b, c by the formula:\n\nR = (a b c) / (4 \u0394)\n\nwhere \u0394 is the area of the triangle.\n\nThe inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter s by:\n\nr = \u0394 / s\n\nwhere s = (a + b + c) / 2.\n\nSo, we have R = 13 and r = 6.\n\nAlso, the distance between the incenter I and circumcenter O is given by the formula:\n\nOI = \u221a(R(R - 2r))\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. I think the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, OI = \u221a(R\u00b2 - 2Rr). Let me plug in the values: R = 13, r = 6.\n\nSo, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = \u221a13.\n\nBut wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, that's a specific condition. So, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI.\n\nLet me visualize this. In triangle ABC, the incenter I is inside the triangle, and the circumcenter O is also inside since the triangle is acute (since R is 13 and r is 6, which is typical for an acute triangle). So, OI is a line segment connecting O to I. IA is the line from I to vertex A. These two lines are perpendicular.\n\nSo, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle AIO is right-angled at I.\n\nSo, in triangle AIO, we have:\n\nAI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nWait, because in a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. Here, legs are AI and OI, and the hypotenuse is AO.\n\nBut AO is the distance from A to the circumradius, which is just the radius R. Wait, AO is the distance from A to O, which is the circumradius. So, AO = R = 13.\n\nTherefore, AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2 => AI\u00b2 + (\u221a13)\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 => AI\u00b2 + 13 = 169 => AI\u00b2 = 156 => AI = \u221a156.\n\nWait, but AI is the length from the inradius to vertex A. There's a formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex, right? Let me recall.\n\nI think the formula for AI is AI = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Alternatively, another formula is AI = 2R sin(A/2). Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, I think AI = (r) / sin(A/2). Or is it something else?\n\nAlternatively, I might be mixing it up. Let me think. The distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles and the inradius.\n\nWait, I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by:\n\nAI = (r) / sin(A/2)\n\nYes, that seems right. Because in the excentral triangle, but let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps AI can be expressed as AI = (\u0394 / (s - a)) * something. Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to derive it.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius is r. The incenter I is located at distances equal to r from each side. The distance from I to vertex A can be found using trigonometric relationships.\n\nIn triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches side BC, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, in triangle AIF, we have:\n\nAI = r / sin(A/2)\n\nYes, that formula makes sense. So, AI = r / sin(A/2).\n\nWait, but earlier I found AI = \u221a156 \u2248 12.49. Given that r = 6, then AI = 6 / sin(A/2) = \u221a156. So,\n\n6 / sin(A/2) = \u221a156.\n\nLet me solve for sin(A/2):\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / \u221a156 = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = (\u221a39)/13.\n\nWait, because 3/\u221a39 can be rationalized as (3\u221a39)/39 = \u221a39/13. So, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nThen, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nHmm, okay. So, cos(A/2) = \u221a130 /13.\n\nWait, but how does this help me find AB \u00b7 AC?\n\nAB is the side opposite to C, which is denoted as c, and AC is the side opposite to B, which is denoted as b. So, AB = c, AC = b.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC = b c.\n\nI need to find bc.\n\nI know that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to various other quantities. Let me recall that in a triangle:\n\na = 2 R sin A\n\nb = 2 R sin B\n\nc = 2 R sin C\n\nSo, bc = (2 R sin B)(2 R sin C) = 4 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the most straightforward way. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula involving the inradius and semiperimeter.\n\nWe know that r = \u0394 / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, \u0394 = r s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = (a b c) / (4 R).\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for \u0394:\n\nr s = (a b c) / (4 R).\n\nTherefore,\n\na b c = 4 R r s.\n\nHmm, but I need bc. So, if I can express a in terms of other variables, maybe I can find bc.\n\nWait, but I don't know a. Alternatively, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, another formula I recall is that in any triangle,\n\nAI = (r) / sin(A/2).\n\nAnd earlier, we found AI = \u221a156.\n\nSo, 6 / sin(A/2) = \u221a156 => sin(A/2) = 6 / \u221a156 = \u221a(36/156) = \u221a(3/13) = \u221a39 / 13. Wait, no, wait, 6 / \u221a156.\n\nLet me compute 6 / \u221a156.\n\n\u221a156 = \u221a(4*39) = 2\u221a39. So, 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = \u221a39 / 13, as I had before.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nSo, cos(A) can be found using the double-angle formula:\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 13/23. Wait, 91/169 simplifies to 7*13 /13\u00b2, which is 7/13. Wait, 91 \u00f713 is 7, 169 \u00f713 is 13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nTherefore, angle A has cosine 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines:\n\ncos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) / (2 b c).\n\nSo,\n\n7/13 = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) / (2 b c).\n\nHmm, but I don't know a, b, or c. But I know R = 13, so a = 2 R sin A.\n\nWait, a = 2 R sin A, right? Because a = 2 R sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 2 R sin B, c = 2 R sin C.\n\nSo, let's express a, b, c in terms of angles.\n\nSo, a = 2*13*sin A = 26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, let me plug these into the Law of Cosines equation.\n\n7/13 = ( (26 sin B)^2 + (26 sin C)^2 - (26 sin A)^2 ) / (2 * 26 sin B * 26 sin C )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 26\u00b2 (sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C - sin\u00b2 A) = 676 (sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C - sin\u00b2 A)\n\nDenominator: 2 * 26 sin B * 26 sin C = 2 * 676 sin B sin C = 1352 sin B sin C\n\nSo, 7/13 = [676 (sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C - sin\u00b2 A)] / [1352 sin B sin C]\n\nSimplify 676 /1352 = 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n7/13 = [ (sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C - sin\u00b2 A) ] / (2 sin B sin C )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 sin B sin C:\n\n(14/13) sin B sin C = sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C - sin\u00b2 A.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of inradius and semiperimeter.\n\n\u0394 = r s = 6 s.\n\nBut also, \u0394 = (a b c) / (4 R) = (a b c) / (4 *13) = (a b c) / 52.\n\nSo, 6 s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.\n\nBut I don't know s or a, b, c individually.\n\nWait, but I need bc. Let me see if I can relate this.\n\nWe have a b c = 312 s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, a b c = 312 * (a + b + c)/2 = 156 (a + b + c).\n\nBut that seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, let me think about angle A. We found cos A = 7/13, so sin A can be found as sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, a = 2 R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nOkay, so side a is known now. So, a = BC = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, now, using the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nWe can plug in a\u00b2 = (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 = 16*30=480.\n\ncos A = 7/13.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c (7/13).\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c = 480.\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving b and c.\n\nI need another equation to relate b and c.\n\nWait, perhaps using the inradius formula.\n\nWe know that r = \u0394 / s, where \u0394 is the area, and s is the semiperimeter.\n\nWe also have \u0394 = (a b c)/(4 R) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/(4*13) = (sqrt(30) b c)/13.\n\nSo, \u0394 = (sqrt(30) b c)/13.\n\nAlso, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, r = \u0394 / s => 6 = [ (sqrt(30) b c)/13 ] / [ (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 ].\n\nSimplify this:\n\n6 = [ (sqrt(30) b c)/13 ] * [ 2 / (4 sqrt(30) + b + c) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n6 (4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = 2 (sqrt(30) b c)/13\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n78 (4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = 2 sqrt(30) b c\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n39 (4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = sqrt(30) b c\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(30) b c = 39 * (4 sqrt(30) + b + c )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsqrt(30) b c = 156 sqrt(30) + 39 b + 39 c.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nsqrt(30) b c - 39 b - 39 c = 156 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Let me think if there's another formula I can use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for AI in terms of sides.\n\nEarlier, AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156).\n\nWait, but I think we used that already to find sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, maybe another formula for AI. There's a formula that relates AI to the sides:\n\nAI = (b c)/(b + c) * (1 + cos A)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nI think AI can be expressed as:\n\nAI = (r) / sin(A/2) = (\u0394 / s) / sin(A/2).\n\nBut perhaps another way. Alternatively, using the formula for the length of the angle bisector.\n\nWait, AI is the length of the angle bisector from A to the inradius. Hmm, maybe not exactly the angle bisector, but the inradius is located along the angle bisector.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express AI in terms of sides b and c.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the distance from A to I is given by:\n\nAI = (2 b c cos (A/2)) / (b + c).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the length of the internal angle bisector from A can be given by:\n\nd = (2 b c cos (A/2)) / (b + c).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, since AI is along the angle bisector, AI = (2 b c cos (A/2)) / (b + c).\n\nEarlier, we found AI = sqrt(156) and cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(156) = [2 b c (sqrt(130)/13)] / (b + c).\n\nSimplify sqrt(156): sqrt(4*39) = 2 sqrt(39). So,\n\n2 sqrt(39) = [2 b c sqrt(130) /13 ] / (b + c)\n\nMultiply both sides by (b + c):\n\n2 sqrt(39) (b + c) = [2 b c sqrt(130)/13 ]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(39) (b + c) = (b c sqrt(130)) /13\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n13 sqrt(39) (b + c) = b c sqrt(130)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nb c sqrt(130) = 13 sqrt(39) (b + c)\n\nHmm, okay. So, I have this equation.\n\nLet me note that sqrt(130) = sqrt(13*10) = sqrt(13)*sqrt(10), and sqrt(39) = sqrt(13*3) = sqrt(13)*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nb c sqrt(13) sqrt(10) = 13 sqrt(13) sqrt(3) (b + c)\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(13):\n\nb c sqrt(10) = 13 sqrt(3) (b + c)\n\nSo,\n\nb c sqrt(10) = 13 sqrt(3) (b + c)\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write this as:\n\nb c = [13 sqrt(3) / sqrt(10)] (b + c)\n\nOr,\n\nb c = 13 sqrt(3/10) (b + c)\n\nLet me note that sqrt(3/10) is sqrt(30)/10. So,\n\nb c = 13 (sqrt(30)/10) (b + c) = (13 sqrt(30)/10) (b + c)\n\nSo, equation (1): b c = (13 sqrt(30)/10) (b + c)\n\nEarlier, from the Law of Cosines, we had:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c = 480. Let's call this equation (2).\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1. b c = (13 sqrt(30)/10) (b + c)\n2. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c = 480\n\nLet me denote S = b + c and P = b c.\n\nThen, equation (1) becomes:\n\nP = (13 sqrt(30)/10) S\n\nEquation (2): b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 480 + (14/13) P.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be expressed as (b + c)^2 - 2 b c = S\u00b2 - 2 P.\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 - 2 P = 480 + (14/13) P\n\nSubstitute P from equation (1):\n\nS\u00b2 - 2*(13 sqrt(30)/10 S) = 480 + (14/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10 S)\n\nSimplify:\n\nS\u00b2 - (26 sqrt(30)/10) S = 480 + (14 sqrt(30)/10) S\n\nMultiply both sides by 10 to eliminate denominators:\n\n10 S\u00b2 - 26 sqrt(30) S = 4800 + 14 sqrt(30) S\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\n10 S\u00b2 - 26 sqrt(30) S - 14 sqrt(30) S - 4800 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10 S\u00b2 - 40 sqrt(30) S - 4800 = 0\n\nDivide all terms by 10:\n\nS\u00b2 - 4 sqrt(30) S - 480 = 0\n\nSo, we have a quadratic in S:\n\nS\u00b2 - 4 sqrt(30) S - 480 = 0\n\nLet me solve for S using the quadratic formula.\n\nS = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b1 sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 4*480 ) ] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 4*480 = 16*30 + 1920 = 480 + 1920 = 2400.\n\nSo,\n\nS = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b1 sqrt(2400)] / 2.\n\nSimplify sqrt(2400):\n\nsqrt(2400) = sqrt(100*24) = 10 sqrt(24) = 10*2 sqrt(6) = 20 sqrt(6).\n\nSo,\n\nS = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b1 20 sqrt(6)] / 2 = 2 sqrt(30) \u00b1 10 sqrt(6).\n\nSince S = b + c must be positive, both terms are positive, so we take the positive sign:\n\nS = 2 sqrt(30) + 10 sqrt(6).\n\nWait, but let me check: if I take the negative sign, 2 sqrt(30) - 10 sqrt(6), is that positive?\n\nCompute approximate values:\n\nsqrt(30) \u22485.477, sqrt(6)\u22482.449.\n\nSo, 2*5.477 \u224810.954, 10*2.449\u224824.49. So, 10.954 -24.49\u2248-13.54, which is negative. So, S must be positive, so S=2 sqrt(30) +10 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, S=2 sqrt(30)+10 sqrt(6).\n\nNow, from equation (1): P = (13 sqrt(30)/10) S.\n\nSo, P = (13 sqrt(30)/10)(2 sqrt(30) +10 sqrt(6)).\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, distribute:\n\n= (13 sqrt(30)/10)(2 sqrt(30)) + (13 sqrt(30)/10)(10 sqrt(6)).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (13 sqrt(30)*2 sqrt(30))/10 = (26 * 30)/10 = 780 /10 =78.\n\nSecond term: (13 sqrt(30)*10 sqrt(6))/10 = 13 sqrt(30)*sqrt(6) =13 sqrt(180).\n\nSimplify sqrt(180) = sqrt(36*5)=6 sqrt(5). So,\n\nSecond term:13 *6 sqrt(5)=78 sqrt(5).\n\nSo, total P=78 +78 sqrt(5).\n\nWait, so P=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nBut P is bc, so bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, P = (13 sqrt(30)/10) * S = (13 sqrt(30)/10)(2 sqrt(30) +10 sqrt(6)).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 13 sqrt(30) *2 sqrt(30) = 26 * (sqrt(30))^2 =26*30=780.\n\nDivide by 10: 780/10=78.\n\nSecond term:13 sqrt(30)*10 sqrt(6)=130 sqrt(180).\n\nsqrt(180)=sqrt(36*5)=6 sqrt(5). So,\n\n130 *6 sqrt(5)=780 sqrt(5).\n\nDivide by 10:780 sqrt(5)/10=78 sqrt(5).\n\nSo, P=78 +78 sqrt(5).\n\nSo, bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nHmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nBut the problem asks for AB \u00b7 AC, which is bc. So, the answer is 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but 78(1 + sqrt(5)) is approximately 78*(3.236)= around 252.888, which seems plausible.\n\nBut let me verify if all the steps are correct.\n\nStarting from the beginning, we found AI=\u221a156, which led us to sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13 and cos(A/2)=\u221a130/13.\n\nThen, using the angle bisector formula, AI=(2 b c cos(A/2))/(b + c), which led to bc= (13 sqrt(30)/10)(b + c).\n\nThen, using the Law of Cosines, we derived a quadratic in S=b +c, solved it, and found S=2 sqrt(30)+10 sqrt(6), then substituted back to find P=bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but let me check: in the step where I used the formula AI=(2 b c cos(A/2))/(b + c), is that correct?\n\nYes, because the formula for the length of the angle bisector is (2 b c cos(theta/2))/(b + c), where theta is the angle at A.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to compute the numerical values.\n\nCompute a=4 sqrt(30)\u22484*5.477\u224821.908.\n\nCompute S=2 sqrt(30)+10 sqrt(6)\u22482*5.477 +10*2.449\u224810.954 +24.49\u224835.444.\n\nCompute P=78(1 + sqrt(5))\u224878*(1 +2.236)\u224878*3.236\u2248252.888.\n\nSo, bc\u2248252.888.\n\nNow, let's check if with a\u224821.908, b + c\u224835.444, and bc\u2248252.888, the Law of Cosines holds.\n\nCompute a\u00b2\u224821.908\u00b2\u2248480.\n\nCompute b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nWe have cos A=7/13\u22480.538.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2\u2248(b + c)^2 - 2 bc\u224835.444\u00b2 - 2*252.888\u22481255.7 -505.776\u2248749.924.\n\nThen, 2 bc cos A\u22482*252.888*0.538\u22482*252.888*0.538\u22482*136.54\u2248273.08.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 bc cos A\u2248749.924 -273.08\u2248476.844.\n\nWhich is close to a\u00b2\u2248480. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding errors.\n\nSo, seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nBut let me compute it exactly.\n\n78(1 + sqrt(5))=78 +78 sqrt(5).\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects an exact form, so 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nAlternatively, factor 78 as 6*13, so 6*13(1 + sqrt(5))=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a simplified radical form, which is 78 +78 sqrt(5).\n\nBut I think either is acceptable.\n\nWait, but let me check if 78(1 + sqrt(5)) can be simplified further.\n\nNo, I think that's the simplest form.\n\nSo, the final answer is 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, another thought: since AI is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumradius, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me try to model the triangle in coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0). Since AI is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), then O lies along the line perpendicular to AI at I.\n\nWait, but AI is from I(0,0) to A somewhere. So, if AI is perpendicular to OI, then O lies along the line perpendicular to AI at I.\n\nBut AI is from I(0,0) to A(a, b), so the slope of AI is (b - 0)/(a - 0)=b/a.\n\nTherefore, the slope of OI, which is perpendicular, is -a/b.\n\nBut since O lies along OI, which is the line from I(0,0) with slope -a/b.\n\nBut also, O is the circumradius center, so OA=OB=OC=13.\n\nHmm, but this might get too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the earlier result.\n\nSo, after all the calculations, I think the answer is 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( AIO \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nAI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2\n\\]\n\nWe know \\( AO = R = 13 \\) and \\( OI = \\sqrt{R^2 - 2Rr} = \\sqrt{13^2 - 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{13} \\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nAI^2 + 13 = 169 \\implies AI^2 = 156 \\implies AI = \\sqrt{156}\n\\]\n\nThe length \\( AI \\) can also be expressed as \\( AI = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\). Equating the two expressions for \\( AI \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} = \\sqrt{156} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{156}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity \\( \\cos(A) = 1 - 2\\sin^2(A/2) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos(A) = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\\right)^2 = \\frac{7}{13}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the Law of Cosines:\n\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos(A)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = 4\\sqrt{30} \\) (derived from \\( a = 2R \\sin(A) \\)) and \\( \\cos(A) = \\frac{7}{13} \\):\n\n\\[\n480 = b^2 + c^2 - \\frac{14}{13}bc\n\\]\n\nWe also use the inradius formula \\( r = \\frac{\\Delta}{s} \\) and express the area \\( \\Delta \\) in terms of \\( bc \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\frac{abc}{4R} \\implies 6s = \\frac{4\\sqrt{30}bc}{52} \\implies bc = \\frac{13\\sqrt{30}}{10}(b + c)\n\\]\n\nLet \\( S = b + c \\) and \\( P = bc \\). Substituting into the equations, we solve for \\( S \\) and \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\nS = 2\\sqrt{30} + 10\\sqrt{6}, \\quad P = 78(1 + \\sqrt{5})\n\\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = bc = 78(1 + \\sqrt{5}) \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{78(1 + \\sqrt{5})}\n\\]",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC. It mentions the circumcenter O and the incenter I. The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm. Let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet and is the center of the inscribed circle.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a key piece of information. I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be expressed in terms of other parameters, but I'm not sure exactly how. Maybe I can use the formula that relates OI, the distance between incenter and circumradius.\n\nWait, there's a formula: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if that's correct. Yes, I think that's right. So OI squared is equal to R times (R minus 2r). Given R is 13 and r is 6, let me compute OI\u00b2.\n\nSo OI\u00b2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*1=13. So OI is sqrt(13). But wait, is this correct? Let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. I think the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Oh wait, no, wait. I think I confused two different formulas. Let me double-check.\n\nI recall that OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, substituting R=13 and r=6, we get OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Okay, so that's correct. So OI is sqrt(13). Got it.\n\nNow, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. Hmm. Let me think about how to use this. Maybe coordinate geometry would help here? Or perhaps vector methods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use some properties of the triangle involving the inradius and the distances from the incenter to the vertices. Let me recall that the length of IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.\n\nI remember that the length from the inradius to a vertex can be given by IA = r / sin(A/2). Wait, is that right? Let me think. The inradius is related to the area and semiperimeter. Also, in triangle AII_A (where I_A is the excenter opposite A), but maybe that's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider coordinates. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system to simplify things. Let me set point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is the line connecting the incenter (origin) to the circumcenter (point O). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), then the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.\n\nWait, but O is a point, so OI is the vector from I to O, which is just the position vector of O. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the dot product of vectors IA and OI is zero.\n\nBut in my coordinate system, I is at (0,0), so point A is somewhere, and O is at some point (h,k). Then vector IA is (x_A, y_A), since I is at (0,0). Vector OI is (h,k). Their dot product is x_A*h + y_A*k = 0.\n\nSo, (x_A, y_A) \u00b7 (h,k) = 0.\n\nBut I don't know the coordinates of O or A yet. Maybe I can find another way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use trigonometric identities. Let me think about the triangle and the given conditions.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the line from incenter to circumradius. Let me recall that in a triangle, the Euler line connects the incenter and circumcenter, but wait, no, the Euler line connects the centroid, circumcenter, and orthocenter. The incenter is generally not on the Euler line unless the triangle is equilateral, which it isn't here because the inradius and circumradius are different.\n\nBut in any case, IA is perpendicular to OI. So perhaps there's a relation in terms of angles or side lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for IA. IA can be expressed as IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Similarly, OI is sqrt(R(R-2r)) as we found earlier, which is sqrt(13). Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for IA in terms of the triangle's sides.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle AIO, we have points A, I, and O. We know that IA is perpendicular to OI, which makes triangle AIO a right triangle at I. So, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, AI\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nBut AO is the distance from A to the circumradius. Wait, AO is just the circumradius R, which is 13. So AO = R =13. So, AI\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2 = 13\u00b2=169.\n\nWe already found IO\u00b2=13, so AI\u00b2 +13 =169. So AI\u00b2=156, so AI= sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39). Okay, so AI is 2\u221a39.\n\nBut AI can also be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles. I remember that AI = r / sin(A/2). Let me write that down: AI = r / sin(A/2). Given that r=6, so AI =6 / sin(A/2). We found AI=2\u221a39, so 6 / sin(A/2)=2\u221a39.\n\nSo sin(A/2)=6/(2\u221a39)=3/\u221a39=\u221a39/13. Because 3 divided by sqrt(39) is 3/(\u221a39)= (3\u221a39)/(39)=\u221a39/13.\n\nSo sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13.\n\nHmm, okay. So we can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x=1. So cos\u00b2(A/2)=1 - (39/169)= (169-39)/169=130/169. So cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13. Since A/2 is acute, cosine is positive.\n\nNow, I can relate this to the sides of the triangle. Let me recall that in a triangle, the length of the side is related to the inradius and semiperimeter. Let me denote the semiperimeter as s=(a+b+c)/2. Then, the area is r*s=6s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the circumradius R: area = (a*b*c)/(4R). So, 6s=(a*b*c)/(4*13)= (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c=312 s.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful. Let me think about other relations.\n\nAnother formula I remember is that AI = (r)/sin(A/2). We have AI=2\u221a39, so 2\u221a39=6/sin(A/2). Wait, we did that already.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express AI in terms of the sides. There's a formula that AI = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c). Wait, let me check that.\n\nYes, in triangle ABC, the length from the inradius to vertex A is given by AI = (r)/sin(A/2). Alternatively, AI can also be expressed as (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c). So, let me write that:\n\nAI = (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c).\n\nWe know AI=2\u221a39, and cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n2\u221a39 = [2bc*(sqrt(130)/13)] / (b + c).\n\nSimplify this:\n\nMultiply both sides by (b + c):\n\n2\u221a39 (b + c) = 2bc (sqrt(130)/13).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\u221a39 (b + c) = bc (sqrt(130)/13).\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n13\u221a39 (b + c) = bc sqrt(130).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy, but perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.\n\nWait, before squaring, maybe express sqrt(130) as sqrt(13*10)=sqrt(13)*sqrt(10). Similarly, sqrt(39)=sqrt(13*3)=sqrt(13)*sqrt(3). Let's see.\n\nSo,\n\n13 * sqrt(13) * sqrt(3) * (b + c) = bc * sqrt(13) * sqrt(10).\n\nWe can cancel sqrt(13) from both sides:\n\n13 * sqrt(3) (b + c) = bc sqrt(10).\n\nSo,\n\n13 sqrt(3) (b + c) = bc sqrt(10).\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nbc sqrt(10) -13 sqrt(3) (b + c)=0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe let's denote bc = x, and b + c = y. Then, equation becomes:\n\nx sqrt(10) -13 sqrt(3) y =0.\n\nBut I don't have another equation yet. Maybe I can find another relation involving b and c.\n\nWait, let's think about the area. The area is 6s, and also area is (a*b*c)/(4R)= (a*b*c)/(52).\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c=312 s.\n\nBut s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, but I don't know a, so maybe this is not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for cos(A). Since we have cos(A/2), maybe we can find cos A using the double-angle formula.\n\nYes, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2).\n\nWe have sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13. So,\n\ncos A=1 - 2*(39/169)=1 - 78/169= (169-78)/169=91/169=13/23.\n\nWait, wait, 91 divided by 169 is 7*13 /13\u00b2=7/13. Wait, no, 91 is 7*13, 169 is 13\u00b2, so 91/169=7/13. So cos A=7/13.\n\nSo, angle A has cosine 7/13, so sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2 )=sqrt(1 -49/169)=sqrt(120/169)=2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nAlternatively, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(5070)/169. Wait, that's more complicated, but 5070=39*130, which is 39*13*10=13\u00b2*3*10. So sqrt(5070)=13*sqrt(30). So sin A=2*(13*sqrt(30))/(13*13)=2*sqrt(30)/13, which matches the earlier result.\n\nOkay, so sin A=2\u221a30/13.\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, by the Law of Sines, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30. So side a, which is BC, is 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, BC=a=4\u221a30.\n\nNow, we need to find AB\u00b7AC, which is c\u00b7b, since in standard notation, AB=c and AC=b. So, product bc.\n\nWait, yes, because in triangle ABC, side opposite A is a, side opposite B is c, and side opposite C is b. So, AB is c, AC is b, so AB\u00b7AC = b*c.\n\nSo, we need to find bc.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have equation:\n\n13 sqrt(3) (b + c) = bc sqrt(10).\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n13\u221a3 (b + c) = bc \u221a10.\n\nLet me denote bc = x, and (b + c) = y.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n13\u221a3 y = x \u221a10.\n\nBut we need another equation involving x and y.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines. Since we know angle A and side a, we can write:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a=4\u221a30, so a\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\ncos A=7/13, so:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nAlso, note that (b + c)^2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2bc.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + c)^2 - 2bc = y\u00b2 - 2x.\n\nSubstituting into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\n480 = (y\u00b2 - 2x) - (14/13)x.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - 2x - (14/13)x.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - (2 + 14/13)x.\n\nCompute 2 +14/13= (26 +14)/13=40/13.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - (40/13)x.\n\nBut from earlier, we have 13\u221a3 y = x\u221a10.\n\nLet me solve for x in terms of y: x= (13\u221a3 y)/\u221a10.\n\nSo, x= (13\u221a3 /\u221a10) y.\n\nLet me substitute x into the equation 480 = y\u00b2 - (40/13)x.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - (40/13)*(13\u221a3 /\u221a10) y.\n\nSimplify:\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - (40\u221a3 /\u221a10) y.\n\nSimplify 40\u221a3 /\u221a10:\n\n40\u221a3 /\u221a10 = 40 * sqrt(3/10) = 40 * sqrt(30)/10 = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - 4 sqrt(30) y.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\ny\u00b2 -4 sqrt(30) y -480=0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in y: y\u00b2 -4\u221a30 y -480=0.\n\nLet me solve for y using quadratic formula:\n\ny = [4\u221a30 \u00b1 sqrt( (4\u221a30)^2 +4*480 )]/2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(4\u221a30)^2=16*30=480.\n\nSo sqrt(480 + 4*480)=sqrt(480 +1920)=sqrt(2400)=sqrt(100*24)=10*sqrt(24)=10*2*sqrt(6)=20\u221a6.\n\nSo,\n\ny= [4\u221a30 \u00b120\u221a6]/2= 2\u221a30 \u00b110\u221a6.\n\nSince y is the sum of sides b and c, it must be positive. So we take the positive root:\n\ny=2\u221a30 +10\u221a6.\n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. Because if I take y=2\u221a30 +10\u221a6, then x= (13\u221a3 /\u221a10)y= (13\u221a3 /\u221a10)(2\u221a30 +10\u221a6).\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\nx=13\u221a3 /\u221a10 * [2\u221a30 +10\u221a6] =13\u221a3 /\u221a10 *2\u221a30 +13\u221a3 /\u221a10 *10\u221a6.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 13\u221a3 *2\u221a30 /\u221a10=26 *\u221a(3*30)/\u221a10=26 *\u221a90 /\u221a10=26*(3\u221a10)/\u221a10=26*3=78.\n\nSecond term:13\u221a3 *10\u221a6 /\u221a10=130 *\u221a(3*6)/\u221a10=130*\u221a18 /\u221a10=130*(3\u221a2)/\u221a10=130*3\u221a(2/10)=130*3*\u221a(1/5)=130*3/(\u221a5)= (390)/\u221a5= 78\u221a5.\n\nSo, x=78 +78\u221a5.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Let me see if I did the algebra correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of x.\n\nLet me recompute x= (13\u221a3 /\u221a10)y, where y=2\u221a30 +10\u221a6.\n\nSo,\n\nx= (13\u221a3 /\u221a10)(2\u221a30 +10\u221a6).\n\nFirst term: 13\u221a3 *2\u221a30 /\u221a10=26 *\u221a(3*30)/\u221a10=26 *\u221a90 /\u221a10=26*(3\u221a10)/\u221a10=26*3=78.\n\nSecond term:13\u221a3 *10\u221a6 /\u221a10=130 *\u221a(3*6)/\u221a10=130*\u221a18 /\u221a10=130*(3\u221a2)/\u221a10=130*3\u221a(2/10)=130*3*(\u221a(1/5))=130*3/(\u221a5)=390/\u221a5=78\u221a5.\n\nSo yes, x=78 +78\u221a5.\n\nSo bc=78(1 +\u221a5).\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit big. Let me think if there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find bc in another way. Let me recall that in a triangle, area = r*s =6s, and area is also (1/2)*ab*sin C, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, earlier we had:\n\na=4\u221a30, and from the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na\u00b2=480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nBut we also have (b + c)^2 = y\u00b2= [2\u221a30 +10\u221a6]^2= (2\u221a30)^2 + (10\u221a6)^2 + 2*(2\u221a30)(10\u221a6).\n\nCompute that:\n\n(2\u221a30)^2=4*30=120.\n\n(10\u221a6)^2=100*6=600.\n\nCross term:2*2\u221a30*10\u221a6=40\u221a180=40*6\u221a5=240\u221a5.\n\nSo y\u00b2=120 +600 +240\u221a5=720 +240\u221a5.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = y\u00b2 - 2bc=720 +240\u221a5 -2x.\n\nBut from earlier, we have:\n\n480= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc= (720 +240\u221a5 -2x) - (14/13)x.\n\nWait, let me substitute b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 from y\u00b2:\n\n480= (720 +240\u221a5 -2x) - (14/13)x.\n\nSo,\n\n480=720 +240\u221a5 -2x - (14/13)x.\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\n-2x - (14/13)x = -(26/13 +14/13)x= -40/13 x.\n\nSo,\n\n480=720 +240\u221a5 - (40/13)x.\n\nBring 720 +240\u221a5 to left:\n\n480 -720 -240\u221a5= - (40/13)x.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n480 -720= -240. So,\n\n-240 -240\u221a5= - (40/13)x.\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n240 +240\u221a5= (40/13)x.\n\nMultiply both sides by (13/40):\n\nx= (240 +240\u221a5)*(13/40)= (240/40)*(13) + (240\u221a5 /40)*13=6*13 +6\u221a5 *13=78 +78\u221a5.\n\nSo, bc=78(1 +\u221a5). So, AB\u00b7AC=78(1 +\u221a5).\n\nWait, but the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is bc. So, 78(1 +\u221a5).\n\nHmm, but let me check if that's correct. Let me see, 78 is 6*13, which might make sense given the inradius and circumradius. Alternatively, perhaps I can rationalize or present it differently.\n\nWait, 78(1 +\u221a5) is the same as 78 +78\u221a5. But perhaps the problem expects a more simplified form or maybe an integer, but 78(1 +\u221a5) is an exact value, so maybe that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me recap.\n\nWe started with AI perpendicular to OI, found AI=2\u221a39, then found sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13, cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nThen, using the formula for AI in terms of sides, AI=(2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c)=2\u221a39.\n\nThis led to the equation 13\u221a3 (b + c)= bc\u221a10.\n\nThen, using Law of Cosines, a=4\u221a30, so a\u00b2=480= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nExpressed b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 in terms of (b + c)^2 and bc, substituted into the equation, solved for y=(b + c), got y=2\u221a30 +10\u221a6.\n\nThen, from the first equation, bc= (13\u221a3 y)/\u221a10=78(1 +\u221a5).\n\nSo, seems correct. So AB\u00b7AC=78(1 +\u221a5). But wait, 78(1 +\u221a5) is approximately 78*(3.236)= about 252.9, but the problem might expect an exact form, so 78(1 +\u221a5) is acceptable.\n\nWait, but maybe I can factor 78 as 6*13, but I don't think that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer as 78(\u221a5 +1), but I think 78(1 +\u221a5) is fine.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's a smarter way to get bc without going through all these steps. Maybe using some other formula or relation.\n\nWait, another approach: since we know R=13, r=6, and AI=2\u221a39, and AI is perpendicular to OI. Maybe we can relate the sides using other triangle centers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use trigonometric identities. Let me think, since we have angle A and its sine and cosine, maybe express the sides in terms of the angles.\n\nWait, but I think the method I used is correct, so unless I made a calculation mistake, which I tried to check, the answer should be 78(1 +\u221a5).\n\nWait, but let me compute 78(1 +\u221a5)=78 +78\u221a5. Let me see if that's a reasonable answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as 78(\u221a5 +1), which is the same thing.\n\nWait, but perhaps the answer is 78\u221a5 +78, but maybe the problem expects a numerical integer, but since it's involving square roots, I don't think so. So, I think 78(1 +\u221a5) is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that in triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( AIO \\) is a right triangle at \\( I \\). Using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, \\( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \\), we find \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\).\n\nIn the right triangle \\( AIO \\), by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nAI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2 \\implies AI^2 + 13 = 13^2 \\implies AI^2 = 156 \\implies AI = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula \\( AI = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\), we solve for \\( \\sin(A/2) \\):\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}.\n\\]\nUsing the identity \\( \\cos^2(A/2) = 1 - \\sin^2(A/2) \\), we find:\n\\[\n\\cos(A/2) = \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the Law of Cosines to find side \\( a \\) (opposite angle \\( A \\)):\n\\[\na = 2R \\sin A = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\nUsing the Law of Cosines in \\( \\triangle ABC \\):\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \\frac{14}{13}bc.\n\\]\n\nWe also express \\( AI \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and \\( c \\):\n\\[\nAI = \\frac{2bc \\cos(A/2)}{b + c} \\implies 2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{2bc \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13}}{b + c}.\n\\]\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[\n13\\sqrt{3}(b + c) = bc\\sqrt{10}.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x = bc \\) and \\( y = b + c \\). Substituting into the equation from the Law of Cosines:\n\\[\n480 = y^2 - \\frac{40}{13}x.\n\\]\nFrom \\( 13\\sqrt{3}y = x\\sqrt{10} \\), we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{10}}y.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( x \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n480 = y^2 - 4\\sqrt{30}y.\n\\]\nSolving the quadratic equation for \\( y \\), we find \\( y = 2\\sqrt{30} + 10\\sqrt{6} \\). Substituting back, we find:\n\\[\nx = 78(1 + \\sqrt{5}).\n\\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = bc = 78(1 + \\sqrt{5}) \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{78(1 + \\sqrt{5})}\n\\]",
