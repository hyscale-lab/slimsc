      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that a rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at right angles and bisecting each other. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I denote the endpoints of the diagonals as A, B, C, D, then A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So, points A and C are opposite each other, as are B and D. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, and similarly for point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, the rhombus has sides of equal length, and the diagonals are perpendicular. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. So, the vectors OA and OB (where O is the origin) should be perpendicular. Therefore, the dot product of vectors OA and OB should be zero.\n\nVectors OA and OB are (x, y) and (u, v), respectively. Their dot product is xu + yv = 0. So, xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. xu + yv = 0\n\nI need to find BD\u00b2. Let's see, BD is the diagonal from B to D. Wait, no, BD is a diagonal, but since the origin is the midpoint, BD is the diagonal from B to D, but since D is (-u, -v), then BD is from (u, v) to (-u, -v). So, the length of BD is the distance between (u, v) and (-u, -v), which is sqrt[(2u)^2 + (2v)^2] = 2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, BD squared is (2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, I need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombuses, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2? Or is it the maximum lower bound?\n\nWait, maybe I misread. It says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number must be less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. So, it's the infimum, the greatest lower bound of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, right? Because if the points are further out on the hyperbola, BD\u00b2 would be larger. So, is there a lower bound? Or perhaps the problem is about an upper bound?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, this number must be a lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombuses, and it's the greatest such lower bound. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily small, then the infimum would be zero. But that can't be, because BD is a diagonal of a rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola. Maybe BD\u00b2 cannot be too small because of the hyperbola's constraints.\n\nWait, let's think about the hyperbola equation. The hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola opening along the x-axis.\n\nFor a point (x, y) on the hyperbola, x\u00b2 must be at least 20, because x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24). So, the smallest x\u00b2 can be is 20, when y=0.\n\nSo, for point B(u, v), u\u00b2 is at least 20. So, u\u00b2 >=20, v\u00b2 is related to u\u00b2 through the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Since u\u00b2 >=20, and v\u00b2 is positive, BD\u00b2 is at least 4*(20 + something) = 80 + something. So, BD\u00b2 is at least more than 80.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because if u\u00b2 is 20, then from hyperbola equation, v\u00b2 = 24*(x\u00b2/20 -1) = 24*(20/20 -1)=24*(1-1)=0. So, v=0.\n\nSo, when u\u00b2 is 20, v is zero. So, BD\u00b2 would be 4*(20 +0)=80.\n\nBut wait, if B is at (sqrt(20),0), then D is at (-sqrt(20),0). So, the diagonal BD is the line from (sqrt(20),0) to (-sqrt(20),0), which is along the x-axis, length 2*sqrt(20). So, BD squared is (2*sqrt(20))\u00b2=4*20=80.\n\nBut in that case, the rhombus would have points A and C on the hyperbola, but if B and D are on the x-axis, then A and C must be somewhere else on the hyperbola. But wait, if the diagonals are perpendicular, but if one diagonal is along the x-axis, the other must be along the y-axis.\n\nWait, but in the hyperbola equation, when x is sqrt(20), y is zero. So, if point B is (sqrt(20),0), then to have diagonals intersect at the origin and be perpendicular, point A must be (0, something). But (0, something) doesn't lie on the hyperbola because plugging x=0 into the hyperbola equation gives -y\u00b2/24=1, which is impossible. So, that can't be.\n\nWait a second, so maybe that case is impossible. Because if B is on the x-axis, then point A would have to be on the y-axis, but the hyperbola doesn't pass through the y-axis. So, perhaps points B and D cannot lie on the x-axis.\n\nSo, perhaps BD can't be along the x-axis, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is more than 80?\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because when you have a point on the hyperbola, the closest it can get to the origin is when it's at (sqrt(20),0), but that point can't be part of a rhombus because the other diagonal would have to go through the y-axis, which isn't possible.\n\nSo, maybe all rhombuses must have both diagonals not aligned with the axes. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is larger than 80.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nSo, let's think about this: we have two points B(u, v) and D(-u, -v) on the hyperbola, and another two points A(x, y) and C(-x, -y) on the hyperbola. The diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin.\n\nThe diagonals are perpendicular, so OA \u00b7 OB = 0 => x u + y v = 0.\n\nSo, we have the equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. x u + y v = 0\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, we need to find the minimal possible value of 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2), given these constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since 4 is a constant factor, we can just minimize (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, let's set up the problem: minimize u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 subject to u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1 and xu + yv = 0, with x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe we can parameterize points A and B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses.\n\nWait, since the rhombus is formed by points on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps we can use parametric equations for the hyperbola.\n\nThe standard parametrization for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1 is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So, let's use that.\n\nLet me denote point A as (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8) and point B as (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6). Since OA and OB are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, OA \u00b7 OB = (a sec\u03b8)(a sec\u03c6) + (b tan\u03b8)(b tan\u03c6) = 0.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nGiven that a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24, this becomes:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6.\n\nDivide both sides by sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6:\n\n20 = -24 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) * (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6)/(1)\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's divide both sides by sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6:\n\n20 = -24 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) * (1/(sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6))?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 in terms of sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6.\n\nWe have tan\u03b8 = (b/a) sec\u03b8 * (something). Wait, perhaps I can express tan\u03b8 in terms of sec\u03b8.\n\nWait, tan\u03b8 = sqrt(sec\u00b2\u03b8 - 1). Hmm, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let's set t = tan\u03b8 and s = tan\u03c6. Then, sec\u03b8 = sqrt(1 + t\u00b2), sec\u03c6 = sqrt(1 + s\u00b2).\n\nBut maybe that's not the easiest way.\n\nWait, another approach: since OA \u00b7 OB = 0, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSlope of OA is (b tan\u03b8)/(a sec\u03b8) = (b/a) sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, slope of OB is (b/a) sin\u03c6.\n\nSo, (b/a sin\u03b8)(b/a sin\u03c6) = -1.\n\nSo, (b\u00b2/a\u00b2) sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -1.\n\nGiven that a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24, this becomes (24/20) sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -1 => (6/5) sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -1.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, that's an equation we can use.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, now, I can relate \u03b8 and \u03c6 through this equation.\n\nNow, we have points A and B on the hyperbola, with parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6, such that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nNow, what else do we know? We can express u and v in terms of \u03c6.\n\nWait, point B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), so u = a sec\u03c6, v = b tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress in terms of sin and cos:\n\n= 20 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 (sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6)\n= (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / cos\u00b2\u03c6\n= (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe we can write it in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nLet me denote s = sin\u03c6. Then, cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 - s\u00b2.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (20 + 24 s\u00b2) / (1 - s\u00b2).\n\nNow, from earlier, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, so sin\u03b8 = (-5/6)/sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut sin\u03b8 is bounded between -1 and 1, so |(-5)/(6 sin\u03c6)| <=1.\n\nThus, |5/(6 sin\u03c6)| <=1 => |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| >=5/6. So, s = sin\u03c6 >=5/6 or <=-5/6.\n\nSo, s is in [-1, -5/6] or [5/6, 1].\n\nNow, since sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and |sin\u03b8| <=1, then |sin\u03c6| >=5/6 as above.\n\nSo, s is either >=5/6 or <=-5/6.\n\nNow, since we're dealing with u\u00b2 + v\u00b2, which is (20 +24 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2), and s is in [5/6,1] or [-1,-5/6].\n\nBut since s\u00b2 is the same for s and -s, we can just consider s in [5/6,1].\n\nSo, let's let s = sin\u03c6 in [5/6,1].\n\nSo, our expression for u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 is (20 +24 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of this expression as s varies from 5/6 to 1.\n\nBecause u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 is a function of s, and we need to find its minimum in that interval.\n\nSo, let me denote f(s) = (20 +24 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nWe can find the derivative of f(s) with respect to s and find where it's minimized.\n\nBut maybe first, let's see what happens at the endpoints.\n\nAt s=5/6:\n\nf(5/6) = (20 +24*(25/36))/(1 -25/36)\n= (20 + 24*(25/36)) / (11/36)\nCompute numerator:\n24*(25/36)= (24/36)*25 = (2/3)*25 = 50/3 \u224816.6667\nSo, 20 +50/3 = (60 +50)/3 = 110/3 \u224836.6667\nDenominator: 11/36\nSo, f(5/6)= (110/3)/(11/36)= (110/3)*(36/11)= (110*36)/(3*11)= (10*36)/11= 360/11 \u224832.7273\n\nAt s=1:\n\nf(1) is (20 +24*1)/(1-1) which is undefined, approaching infinity.\n\nSo, as s approaches 1, f(s) approaches infinity. So, the minimal value occurs at s=5/6, giving f(s)=360/11.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that the minimal value?\n\nWait, let's compute the derivative to make sure.\n\nf(s) = (20 +24 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2)\n\nf'(s) = [ (48 s)(1 - s\u00b2) - (20 +24 s\u00b2)(-2s) ] / (1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n48s(1 - s\u00b2) + 2s(20 +24 s\u00b2)\n=48s -48 s\u00b3 +40 s +48 s\u00b3\n= (48s +40s) + (-48 s\u00b3 +48 s\u00b3)\n= 88s\n\nSo, f'(s) = 88s / (1 - s\u00b2)^2.\n\nSince s is in [5/6,1], s is positive, so f'(s) is positive in this interval.\n\nTherefore, f(s) is increasing on [5/6,1]. So, the minimal value is at s=5/6, which is 360/11.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 360/11, so BD\u00b2 =4*(360/11)=1440/11\u2248130.9091.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because if f(s) is increasing on [5/6,1], then the minimal value is at s=5/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is 4*(360/11)=1440/11\u2248130.9091.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 1440/11, but can it be larger?\n\nWait, no, BD\u00b2 can be larger than 1440/11, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1440/11. So, 1440/11 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 1440/11.\n\nWait, but wait, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1440/11, so BD\u00b2 is always at least 1440/11. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be 1440/11, because BD\u00b2 is always >=1440/11.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number has to be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nBut if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 1440/11, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 1440/11, because for any number larger than that, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=1440/11, which is less than that number. Therefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 1440/11.\n\nWait, but 1440/11 is approximately 130.9091. So, the answer is 1440/11.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWe had f(s)= (20 +24 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2). At s=5/6, s\u00b2=25/36.\n\nSo, numerator=20 +24*(25/36)=20 + (24*25)/36=20 + (600)/36=20 + 16.6667=36.6667=110/3.\n\nDenominator=1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo, f(5/6)= (110/3)/(11/36)= (110/3)*(36/11)= (10*36)/11=360/11.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, BD\u00b2=4*(360/11)=1440/11.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1440/11, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 1440/11.\n\nWait, but 1440/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so BD\u00b2 can be 1440/11 or larger. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 1440/11, because any number larger than that would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses (since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 1440/11). So, the answer is 1440/11.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1440/11, then 1440/11 is the greatest such number, because any number larger than that would not be less than BD\u00b2 for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=1440/11.\n\nSo, the answer is 1440/11.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, so if points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are \\((u, v)\\) and \\((-u, -v)\\), respectively, then \\(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\\).\n\nGiven the hyperbola equation, \\(u^2/20 - v^2/24 = 1\\), we express \\(u^2 + v^2\\) in terms of a parameter \\(s = \\sin\\phi\\). Using the constraints of the hyperbola and the perpendicularity condition, we find that \\(u^2 + v^2\\) is minimized when \\(s = \\sin\\phi = 5/6\\). Substituting this value, we calculate \\(u^2 + v^2 = 360/11\\). Thus, \\(BD^2 = 4 \\times (360/11) = 1440/11\\).\n\nThe greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombuses is the minimal \\(BD^2\\), which is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1440}{11}}\\).",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The problem says:\n\n\"Let \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) be points on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) such that \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi.\"\n\nHmm, so we have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin. I need to find the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\), which is the square of the length of diagonal BD, such that this number is the greatest lower bound. So, it's like the minimum possible value of BD squared, but since it's the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, I think it's the minimum value.\n\nWait, no. The question is phrased as the greatest real number that is less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi. That means it's the supremum of all numbers that are less than \\( BD^2 \\) for every rhombus. So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is m, then the answer would be m if m is attainable, but if not, it would be approaching m from below. Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, not necessarily right angles. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. I think that's a property of a rhombus: diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, for our problem, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, and they are perpendicular. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis because the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n\nGiven that, we can parameterize the points. Let me think.\n\nSince the rhombus is centered at the origin, the points can be considered as \\( A = (a, b) \\), \\( C = (-a, -b) \\), \\( B = (-b, a) \\), \\( D = (b, -a) \\). Wait, no, that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are perpendicular, then the points can be written as \\( (p, q) \\), \\( (-q, p) \\), \\( (-p, -q) \\), \\( (q, -p) \\). Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the points are arranged such that \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are endpoints of one diagonal, and \\( B \\) and \\( D \\) are endpoints of the other diagonal.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes are negative reciprocals. But in this case, since they are along the axes? Wait, no, the hyperbola is centered at the origin, but the diagonals could be any pair of perpendicular lines through the origin.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that the diagonals are vectors along some direction and its perpendicular direction.\n\nLet me think: if the diagonals are vectors \\( \\vec{d_1} \\) and \\( \\vec{d_2} \\), which are perpendicular, then the four points of the rhombus can be expressed as \\( \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{d_1} + \\vec{d_2}) \\), \\( \\frac{1}{2}(-\\vec{d_1} + \\vec{d_2}) \\), etc. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of parametric points.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, let me denote the endpoints of the diagonals as \\( (a, b) \\) and \\( (-a, -b) \\) for one diagonal, and \\( (c, d) \\) and \\( (-c, -d) \\) for the other diagonal. But since the diagonals are perpendicular, the dot product of vectors \\( (a, b) \\) and \\( (c, d) \\) should be zero. So, \\( a c + b d = 0 \\).\n\nBut since all four points lie on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), each point must satisfy this equation. So, for point \\( (a, b) \\), we have \\( \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\), and similarly for \\( (c, d) \\), \\( \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nBut wait, since \\( (a, b) \\) and \\( (c, d) \\) are endpoints of the diagonals, which are perpendicular, we have \\( a c + b d = 0 \\).\n\nSo, our constraints are:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n3. \\( a c + b d = 0 \\)\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of \\( BD^2 \\), where BD is the length of one of the diagonals. Wait, but BD is a diagonal, so its length is the distance between points B and D.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, right? So, the diagonals are AC and BD, which intersect at the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, the lengths of the diagonals are \\( 2 \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) and \\( 2 \\sqrt{c^2 + d^2} \\), respectively.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the length of AC is the distance between (a, b) and (-a, -b), which is \\( \\sqrt{(2a)^2 + (2b)^2} = 2 \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). Similarly, BD is between (c, d) and (-c, -d), so it's \\( 2 \\sqrt{c^2 + d^2} \\).\n\nSo, the diagonals have lengths \\( 2 \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) and \\( 2 \\sqrt{c^2 + d^2} \\). So, BD is one of these, specifically the diagonal with endpoints (c, d) and (-c, -d). So, BD squared is \\( (2 \\sqrt{c^2 + d^2})^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2) \\).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, but perhaps not attainable, so the supremum of the lower bounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi as described.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is the answer, but I need to check.\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize \\( 4(c^2 + d^2) \\) given the constraints:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n2. \\( a c + b d = 0 \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n\nSo, we have four variables \\( a, b, c, d \\) with three equations, but also the rhombus condition that all sides are equal.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express a and b in terms of c and d using the orthogonality condition.\n\nWait, let's think: since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors (a, b) and (c, d) are perpendicular, so \\( a c + b d = 0 \\). So, we can express, say, a in terms of c, d, and b.\n\nBut also, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but points A and C are (a, b) and (-a, -b), and points B and D are (c, d) and (-c, -d). So, all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, both (a, b) and (c, d) must satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, equations:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n3. \\( a c + b d = 0 \\)\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible value of \\( 4(c^2 + d^2) \\).\n\nBut also, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nWait, but if ABCD is a rhombus, then all sides are equal. So, the distance AB equals BC equals CD equals DA.\n\nSo, the distance between A and B is the same as the distance between B and C.\n\nLet me compute the distance AB. Point A is (a, b), point B is (c, d). So, the distance squared is \\( (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, the distance BC is between (c, d) and (-a, -b). So, squared distance is \\( (c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2 \\).\n\nSince all sides are equal, \\( (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2 \\).\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: \\( (a^2 - 2 a c + c^2) + (b^2 - 2 b d + d^2) \\)\nRight side: \\( (a^2 + 2 a c + c^2) + (b^2 + 2 b d + d^2) \\)\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n[Right] - [Left] = (4 a c + 4 b d) = 0\n\nSo, \\( 4(a c + b d) = 0 \\).\n\nBut from the perpendicularity condition, \\( a c + b d = 0 \\). So, this condition is automatically satisfied. So, the side equality doesn't give us any new information beyond the perpendicularity of the diagonals.\n\nSo, we only have the three equations:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n3. \\( a c + b d = 0 \\)\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible \\( 4(c^2 + d^2) \\).\n\nSo, let's try to express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( a c = -b d \\). Let me solve for a: \\( a = - (b d)/c \\), provided c \u2260 0.\n\nThen, substitute into equation 1:\n\n\\( \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n\nSubstitute a:\n\n\\( \\frac{(b^2 d^2)/(c^2)}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\)\n\nFactor out \\( b^2 \\):\n\n\\( b^2 \\left( \\frac{d^2}{20 c^2} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) = 1 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( k = \\frac{d}{c} \\), so \\( d = k c \\).\n\nThen, substituting:\n\n\\( b^2 \\left( \\frac{(k c)^2}{20 c^2} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) = 1 \\)\nSimplify:\n\n\\( b^2 \\left( \\frac{k^2}{20} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) = 1 \\)\nSo,\n\n\\( b^2 = \\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{k^2}{20} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right)} \\)\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2:\n\n\\( \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1 \\)\nAgain, with \\( d = k c \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{(k c)^2}{24} = 1 \\)\nFactor out c\u00b2:\n\n\\( c^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{k^2}{24} \\right) = 1 \\)\nSo,\n\n\\( c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{k^2}{24} \\right)} \\)\nWhich can be written as:\n\n\\( c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{24 - 5 k^2}{120} \\right)} = \\frac{120}{24 - 5 k^2} \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( b^2 = \\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{k^2}{20} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{24 k^2 - 20}{24 \\times 20} \\right)} = \\frac{24 \\times 20}{24 k^2 - 20} \\)\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Wait, the denominator inside b\u00b2 is \\( \\frac{k^2}{20} - \\frac{1}{24} \\), so let's compute that:\n\n\\( \\frac{k^2}{20} - \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{24 k^2 - 20}{24 \\times 20} \\)\n\nSo, \\( b^2 = \\frac{1}{(24 k^2 - 20)/(24 \\times 20)} ) = \\frac{24 \\times 20}{24 k^2 - 20} \\)\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nSo, now, let's express \\( c^2 + d^2 \\) in terms of k.\n\nSince \\( d = k c \\), \\( c^2 + d^2 = c^2 (1 + k^2) \\).\n\nWe have \\( c^2 = \\frac{120}{24 - 5 k^2} \\), so:\n\n\\( c^2 + d^2 = \\frac{120 (1 + k^2)}{24 - 5 k^2} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2) = 4 \\times \\frac{120 (1 + k^2)}{24 - 5 k^2} = \\frac{480 (1 + k^2)}{24 - 5 k^2} \\)\n\nSo, we need to minimize \\( BD^2 = \\frac{480 (1 + k^2)}{24 - 5 k^2} \\).\n\nBut we need to ensure that the denominators in the expressions for \\( c^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) are positive because \\( c^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) must be positive real numbers.\n\nSo, for \\( c^2 = \\frac{120}{24 - 5 k^2} \\), denominator must be positive: \\( 24 - 5 k^2 > 0 \\) \u2192 \\( k^2 < 24/5 = 4.8 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( b^2 = \\frac{480}{24 k^2 - 20} \\), denominator must be positive: \\( 24 k^2 - 20 > 0 \\) \u2192 \\( k^2 > 20/24 = 5/6 \u2248 0.8333 \\).\n\nSo, k\u00b2 must satisfy \\( 5/6 < k^2 < 24/5 \\).\n\nSo, the domain of k\u00b2 is (5/6, 24/5).\n\nNow, the function to minimize is \\( f(k^2) = \\frac{480 (1 + k^2)}{24 - 5 k^2} \\).\n\nLet me let \\( t = k^2 \\), so t \u2208 (5/6, 24/5).\n\nSo, \\( f(t) = \\frac{480 (1 + t)}{24 - 5 t} \\).\n\nWe can find the minimum of f(t) over t in (5/6, 24/5).\n\nTo find the extrema, take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it to zero.\n\nFirst, compute f'(t):\n\nf(t) = 480 * (1 + t) / (24 - 5 t)\n\nLet me compute the derivative:\n\nf'(t) = 480 * [ (1)(24 -5t) - (1 + t)(-5) ] / (24 -5t)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= 480 * [ (24 -5t) +5(1 + t) ] / (24 -5t)^2\n\n= 480 * [24 -5t +5 +5t] / (24 -5t)^2\n\nSimplify inside:\n\n24 +5 = 29, -5t +5t = 0.\n\nSo numerator is 29.\n\nThus, f'(t) = 480 * 29 / (24 -5t)^2\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Let's redo the derivative.\n\nWait, f(t) = 480 * (1 + t) / (24 -5 t)\n\nLet me compute f'(t) using quotient rule:\n\nIf f(t) = numerator / denominator, then\n\nf\u2019(t) = (num\u2019 * denom - num * denom\u2019) / denom\u00b2\n\nnum = 1 + t \u2192 num\u2019 = 1\n\ndenom = 24 -5 t \u2192 denom\u2019 = -5\n\nSo,\n\nf\u2019(t) = [1*(24 -5t) - (1 + t)*(-5)] / (24 -5t)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n24 -5t +5(1 + t) = 24 -5t +5 +5t = 24 +5 = 29\n\nSo, f\u2019(t) = 29 / (24 -5t)^2\n\nSince 29 is positive and (24 -5t)^2 is always positive in the domain, f\u2019(t) is positive for all t in (5/6, 24/5).\n\nWait, that means f(t) is increasing on the interval (5/6, 24/5). Therefore, the minimal value occurs at the left endpoint, which is t = 5/6.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is f(5/6) = 480*(1 +5/6)/(24 -5*(5/6)).\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, compute numerator:\n\n1 +5/6 = 11/6\n\nDenominator:\n\n24 -25/6 = (144/6 -25/6) = 119/6\n\nSo,\n\nf(5/6) = 480*(11/6)/(119/6) = 480*(11/6)*(6/119) = 480*(11/119) = (480/119)*11\n\nCompute 480 \u00f7 119: 119*4=476, so 480 =119*4 +4 \u2192 4 + 4/119.\n\nSo,\n\n480/119 =4 + 4/119 \u22484.0336\n\nMultiply by 11:\n\n4.0336 *11 \u224844.37\n\nBut let me compute it exactly:\n\n480 *11 =5280\n\n5280 /119.\n\nLet me see if 119 divides into 5280.\n\n119 *44 = 5236\n\n5280 -5236=44\n\nSo, 5280 /119=44 +44/119=44 + 4/10.816...\n\nWait, but 44/119 can be simplified?\n\n44 and 119 have a common divisor? 119=17*7, 44=4*11. No common divisors. So, 44 44/119.\n\nBut wait, 44/119 is approximately 0.366.\n\nSo, 5280 /119\u224844.366.\n\nSo, f(5/6)=5280/119\u224844.366.\n\nBut we need to ensure that this is attainable. Because when t approaches 5/6 from above, we have a valid rhombus.\n\nWait, when t=5/6, which is k\u00b2=5/6, let's check if c\u00b2 and b\u00b2 are positive.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nc\u00b2=120/(24 -5k\u00b2)=120/(24 -5*(5/6))=120/(24 -25/6)=120/( (144-25)/6 )=120/(119/6)=120*6/119=720/119\u22486.05, which is positive.\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2=480/(24k\u00b2 -20)=480/(24*(5/6) -20)=480/(20 -20)=480/0, which is undefined.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, when t=5/6, the denominator in b\u00b2 becomes zero, which is undefined. So, t cannot be exactly 5/6, only approaching it from above.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is approached as t approaches 5/6 from above, making BD\u00b2 approach 5280/119\u224844.366, but not actually reaching it.\n\nSo, the infimum is 5280/119, which is approximately 44.366. Since we need the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, it would be 5280/119. But wait, actually, since BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 5280/119, but never actually reach it, the infimum is 5280/119.\n\nBut let me compute 5280 divided by 119:\n\n119 *44= 5236\n\n5280-5236=44\n\nSo, 5280/119=44 +44/119=44 + 4/10.816...\n\nBut 44/119 is approximately 0.366, so 44.366.\n\nBut perhaps we can write it as a fraction.\n\n5280/119 simplifies? Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(5280,119). Let's find GCD.\n\n119 divides into 5280 how many times? 119*44=5236, as above. 5280-5236=44.\n\nSo, GCD(119,44). 119=2*44 +31\n\n44=1*31 +13\n\n31=2*13 +5\n\n13=2*5 +3\n\n5=1*3 +2\n\n3=1*2 +1\n\n2=2*1 +0\n\nSo, GCD is 1.\n\nTherefore, 5280/119 is in lowest terms.\n\nSo, 5280/119 is approximately 44.366, but as a fraction, it's 5280/119.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 5280/119 from above, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 5280/119. Because for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <5280/119 + \u03b5. Hence, the infimum is 5280/119.\n\nBut let me check: when t approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/119, which is the infimum. Therefore, the greatest lower bound is 5280/119.\n\nWait, but 5280 divided by 119, let me compute that again.\n\n119 \u00d744=5236.\n\n5280-5236=44.\n\nSo, 5280/119=44 +44/119=44 + (44/119). Wait, 44/119 can be simplified?\n\nWait, 44 and 119: 44=4\u00d711, 119=7\u00d717. No common factors. So, 44/119 is in simplest terms.\n\nSo, 5280/119=44 44/119.\n\nAlternatively, as an improper fraction, it's 5280/119.\n\nWait, but 5280 \u00f7119:\n\n119 \u00d744=5236\n\n5280-5236=44\n\nSo, 5280=119\u00d744 +44=119\u00d744 +44=44(119+1)=44\u00d7120.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be. Wait, 44\u00d7120=5280. So, 5280=44\u00d7120.\n\nBut 119 is prime? No, 119=7\u00d717.\n\nSo, 5280=44\u00d7120=4\u00d711\u00d7120.\n\n119=7\u00d717.\n\nSo, 5280/119= (4\u00d711\u00d7120)/(7\u00d717).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Anyway, the exact value is 5280/119.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 5280/119. So, the answer is 5280/119, which can be written as \\boxed{\\dfrac{5280}{119}}.\n\nWait, but 5280 divided by 119 is equal to 44.366... Let me compute 5280 \u00f7119:\n\n119 \u00d744=5236\n\n5280-5236=44\n\nSo, 5280=119\u00d744 +44=44(119 +1)=44\u00d7120=5280.\n\nWait, so 5280/119= (44\u00d7120)/119=44\u00d7(120/119)=44\u00d7(1 +1/119)=44 +44/119.\n\nSo, yeah, that's correct.\n\nBut perhaps we can write this fraction in lower terms. Wait, 5280 and 119.\n\nWait, 119 is 7\u00d717.\n\n5280 \u00f77= 5280/7\u2248754.2857.\n\n5280 \u00f717= 5280/17\u2248310.588.\n\nSo, 5280 and 119 share no common factors besides 1, so 5280/119 is indeed in simplest terms.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 5280/119, which is approximately 44.366.\n\nWait, but let me check if my earlier reasoning about the function being increasing is correct.\n\nI found that f\u2019(t)=29/(24-5t)^2, which is always positive for t in (5/6,24/5). So, the function f(t) is increasing on that interval, which means the minimal value is approached as t approaches 5/6 from above, and the maximum as t approaches 24/5 from below.\n\nSo, the infimum is 5280/119, as I found.\n\nThus, the answer is 5280/119. So, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5280}{119}}.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) and a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular, and all four vertices lie on the hyperbola. We aim to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Hyperbola Constraints**: Each vertex \\((a, b)\\) and \\((c, d)\\) of the rhombus satisfies the hyperbola equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perpendicular Diagonals**: The vectors \\((a, b)\\) and \\((c, d)\\) are perpendicular, so \\(ac + bd = 0\\).\n\n3. **Expressing Variables**: Introduce \\(k = \\frac{d}{c}\\), leading to \\(d = kc\\). Substituting into the hyperbola equations and the perpendicularity condition, we derive expressions for \\(a^2\\), \\(b^2\\), \\(c^2\\), and \\(d^2\\) in terms of \\(k\\).\n\n4. **BD\u00b2 Expression**: The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is \\(2\\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}\\). Thus, \\(BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2)\\). Substituting \\(d = kc\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = \\frac{480(1 + k^2)}{24 - 5k^2}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Minimizing BD\u00b2**: The function \\(f(k^2) = \\frac{480(1 + k^2)}{24 - 5k^2}\\) is minimized over \\(k^2 \\in (5/6, 24/5)\\). The function is increasing in this interval, so the minimum occurs as \\(k^2\\) approaches \\(5/6\\).\n\n6. **Result**: The infimum of \\(BD^2\\) is found to be \\(\\frac{5280}{119}\\), which is approximately \\(44.366\\). Since \\(BD^2\\) can approach this value but never actually reach it, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\frac{5280}{119}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5280}{119}}\n\\]",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.\n\nWe have a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, and D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nHmm, so the rhombus is centered at the origin since the diagonals intersect there. That probably means the points are symmetric with respect to the origin. So if point A is (x, y), then maybe point C is (-x, -y), right? Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric in the same way.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at any angle, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Oh, wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles only in a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that's an important property.\n\nSo, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. So, if AC is one diagonal, then BD is the other, and they are perpendicular.\n\nSince the rhombus is formed by points on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are AC and BD, which are perpendicular.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote points as follows:\n\nA = (x1, y1)\nC = (-x1, -y1) because it's symmetric about the origin.\n\nSimilarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin, so let's say B = (x2, y2), D = (-x2, -y2).\n\nBut wait, since the diagonals are AC and BD, they intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, the diagonals are the lines connecting (x1, y1) to (-x1, -y1) and (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nThe slope of AC is (y1 - (-y1))/(x1 - (-x1)) = (2y1)/(2x1) = y1/x1.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of BD is (y2 - (-y2))/(x2 - (-x2)) = (2y2)/(2x2) = y2/x2.\n\nSince AC and BD are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1:\n\n(y1/x1) * (y2/x2) = -1.\n\nSo, (y1 y2)/(x1 x2) = -1.\n\nOr, y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNow, since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations from the hyperbola.\n\nLet me write down the equations I have so far:\n\n1. y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\n2. x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n3. x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nI need to find BD\u00b2. What's BD\u00b2? Since B is (x2, y2) and D is (-x2, -y2), the length BD is the distance between B and D.\n\nWait, no. Wait, BD is a diagonal. So the length of BD is the distance from B to D, which is sqrt[(x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2] = 2*sqrt(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So BD squared would be 4*(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nBut we are to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, or maybe the minimum value, but the question says the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, actually, the way it's phrased: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but maybe BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, but perhaps it's bounded below? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 can take a range of values, but we need the least upper bound for the lower bound. Hmm, maybe I should think about it more.\n\nWait, but maybe BD\u00b2 can't be smaller than a certain value, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that lower bound.\n\nBut perhaps I should first try to express BD\u00b2 in terms of x1 and y1, or find a relation between x1, y1, x2, y2.\n\nLet me see. From equation 1: y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nLet me try to express y2 in terms of y1, x1, x2: y2 = (-x1 x2)/y1.\n\nThen, plug this into equation 3: x2\u00b2/20 - [(-x1 x2 / y1)^2]/24 = 1.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2/20 - (x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2)/(24 y1\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 [1/20 - (x1\u00b2)/(24 y1\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nNow, from equation 2: x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me write that as x1\u00b2/20 = 1 + y1\u00b2/24.\n\nSo, substituting into the expression above:\n\nx2\u00b2 [1/20 - (x1\u00b2)/(24 y1\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nLet me substitute x1\u00b2 from equation 2:\n\nx1\u00b2 = 20(1 + y1\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x1\u00b2 = 20 + (20 y1\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, substituting into the bracket:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6 ) ] / (24 y1\u00b2 )\n\n= 1/20 - [20/(24 y1\u00b2) + (5 y1\u00b2)/(6*24 y1\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n20/(24 y1\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y1\u00b2)\n\n5/(6*24 y1\u00b2) = 5/(144 y1\u00b2)\n\nSo,\n\n= 1/20 - [5/(6 y1\u00b2) + 5/(144 y1\u00b2) ]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n5/(6 y1\u00b2) = 120/(144 y1\u00b2)\n\nSo, 5/(6 y1\u00b2) + 5/(144 y1\u00b2) = (120 + 5)/(144 y1\u00b2) = 125/(144 y1\u00b2)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n1/20 - 125/(144 y1\u00b2)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nx2\u00b2 [1/20 - 125/(144 y1\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx2\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - 125/(144 y1\u00b2) ]\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n1/20 - 125/(144 y1\u00b2) = (144 y1\u00b2 - 20*125) / (20*144 y1\u00b2 )\n\nWait, let me compute 20*125 = 2500.\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator becomes (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500) / (2880 y1\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nx2\u00b2 = 1 / [ (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500) / (2880 y1\u00b2 ) ] = 2880 y1\u00b2 / (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500 )\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 2880 y1\u00b2 / (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500 )\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2)\n\nBut y2\u00b2 can be expressed from equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1: y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nSo, y2 = (-x1 x2)/y1.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 = (x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2)/ y1\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + (x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2)/ y1\u00b2 )\n\n= 4 x2\u00b2 [1 + x1\u00b2 / y1\u00b2 ]\n\nNow, from equation 2: x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nLet me solve for x1\u00b2:\n\nx1\u00b2 = 20(1 + y1\u00b2 /24 )\n\n= 20 + (20 y1\u00b2)/24\n\n= 20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x1\u00b2 / y1\u00b2 = (20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6 ) / y1\u00b2\n\n= 20 / y1\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\nSo, 1 + x1\u00b2 / y1\u00b2 = 1 + 20 / y1\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\n= (6/6) + 20 / y1\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\n= (11/6) + 20 / y1\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 4 x2\u00b2 [ (11/6) + 20 / y1\u00b2 ]\n\nBut we already have x2\u00b2 expressed in terms of y1\u00b2.\n\nx2\u00b2 = 2880 y1\u00b2 / (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500 )\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [2880 y1\u00b2 / (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500 ) ] * [ (11/6) + 20 / y1\u00b2 ]\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 4 * 2880 y1\u00b2 = 11520 y1\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 11520 y1\u00b2 * [ (11/6) + 20 / y1\u00b2 ] / (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500 )\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n(11/6) + 20 / y1\u00b2 = (11 y1\u00b2 + 120 ) / (6 y1\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 11520 y1\u00b2 * [ (11 y1\u00b2 + 120 ) / (6 y1\u00b2 ) ] / (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n11520 y1\u00b2 * (11 y1\u00b2 + 120 ) / (6 y1\u00b2 ) = (11520 / 6 ) * (11 y1\u00b2 + 120 )\n\n= 1920 * (11 y1\u00b2 + 120 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [1920 (11 y1\u00b2 + 120 ) ] / (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500 )\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 1920 (11 y1\u00b2 + 120 ) / (144 y1\u00b2 - 2500 )\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is a function of y1\u00b2. Let me denote t = y1\u00b2.\n\nSince y1\u00b2 is positive, t > 0.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = 1920 (11 t + 120 ) / (144 t - 2500 )\n\nNow, we can think of BD\u00b2 as a function of t, where t must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nFirst, the denominator 144 t - 2500 must not be zero, so t \u2260 2500/144 \u2248 17.361.\n\nBut also, from the original hyperbola, since x1\u00b2 = 20 + (5 t)/6, x1\u00b2 must be positive, which it is as long as t is positive.\n\nBut looking at x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 = 2880 t / (144 t - 2500 )\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, 2880 t / (144 t - 2500 ) > 0.\n\nSince 2880 is positive, the sign of x2\u00b2 is the same as the sign of t / (144 t - 2500).\n\nSo, t and (144 t - 2500 ) must have the same sign.\n\nCase 1: Both positive.\n\nSo, t > 0 and 144 t - 2500 > 0 => t > 2500 / 144 \u224817.361.\n\nCase 2: Both negative.\n\nt < 0 and 144 t -2500 < 0. But t = y1\u00b2 >=0, so this case is not possible.\n\nHence, t must be greater than 2500 /144.\n\nSo, t > 2500/144.\n\nSo, t > 17.361 approximately.\n\nSo, the domain of t is t > 2500/144.\n\nSo, now, our function BD\u00b2(t) is defined for t > 2500/144.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2(t) as:\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = 1920 (11 t + 120 ) / (144 t - 2500 )\n\nWe can simplify this expression.\n\nFirst, let me factor numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 11 t + 120\n\nDenominator: 144 t -2500\n\nLet me see if I can factor out something.\n\nWait, 1920 / 144 = 13.333... Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform polynomial division or see if it can be rewritten.\n\nLet me try to write BD\u00b2(t) as:\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = 1920 (11 t + 120 ) / (144 t - 2500 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator by common factors.\n\n1920 = 1920.\n\n11 t + 120: 11 and 120 have no common factors.\n\n144 t -2500: 144 and 2500 have a common factor of 4.\n\nSo, 144 t -2500 = 4*(36 t - 625 )\n\nSimilarly, 1920 = 4*480.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = 4*480 (11 t + 120 ) / [4*(36 t - 625 ) ]\n\nThe 4 cancels:\n\n= 480 (11 t + 120 ) / (36 t - 625 )\n\nHmm, perhaps that's simpler.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform division:\n\nLet me see, 480 divided by 36 is 480/36=13.333...\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write BD\u00b2(t) as:\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = (1920 /144 ) * (11 t + 120 ) / (t - 2500/144 )\n\n1920 /144 = 13.333... = 40/3.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = (40/3) * (11 t + 120 ) / (t - 2500/144 )\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not too helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me write it as:\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = (1920 * 11 t + 1920 * 120 ) / (144 t - 2500 )\n\n= (21120 t + 230400 ) / (144 t - 2500 )\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n= (21120 t + 230400 ) / (144 t - 2500 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 21120 t + 230400 = 21120(t) + 230400.\n\nLet me factor 21120 and 230400.\n\n21120 = 2112 * 10 = (2016 + 96) *10, but perhaps better to see GCD.\n\nWait, 21120 and 230400.\n\nLet me compute GCD of 21120 and 230400.\n\n230400 \u00f7 21120 = 10.909... So, 21120 * 10 = 211200, 230400 -211200=19200.\n\nSo GCD(21120,19200). 21120 \u00f719200=1.1, remainder 1920.\n\nGCD(19200,1920)=1920.\n\nSo GCD is 1920.\n\nSo, 21120 \u00f71920=11, 230400 \u00f71920=120.\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator = 1920*(11 t + 120 )\n\nDenominator=144 t -2500.\n\nWhich brings us back to where we were.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to write BD\u00b2 as a function and analyze its behavior as t increases.\n\nWe can treat BD\u00b2(t) as a function for t > 2500/144.\n\nWe can analyze its limit as t approaches infinity.\n\nAs t\u2192infty,\n\nBD\u00b2(t) \u2248 1920*(11 t) / (144 t ) = 1920*(11)/144 = (1920 /144)*11 = (13.333...)*11 = 146.666...\n\nSo, as t becomes very large, BD\u00b2 approaches 146.666..., which is 440/3 \u2248146.666...\n\nWait, 440/3 is about 146.666..., correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 440/3 as t increases.\n\nNow, what about when t is just above 2500/144.\n\nLet's compute t = 2500/144 + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number.\n\nCompute BD\u00b2(t) near t =2500/144.\n\nBut let me compute the value of BD\u00b2 at t=2500/144.\n\nWait, but at t=2500/144, the denominator becomes zero, so BD\u00b2 would approach infinity.\n\nWait, but since t must be greater than 2500/144, the function BD\u00b2(t) is decreasing as t increases beyond that point? Or increasing?\n\nWait, let me compute the derivative of BD\u00b2(t) with respect to t to find whether it's increasing or decreasing.\n\nBut that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, let's consider substituting t slightly larger than 2500/144 and see how BD\u00b2 behaves.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see that as t increases beyond 2500/144, BD\u00b2(t) decreases towards 440/3.\n\nWait, because as t increases, the numerator grows linearly with t, and the denominator also grows linearly with t, but the coefficient in the numerator (11) is less than the coefficient in the denominator (144), so the overall function tends towards 1920*11 /144 = 440/3.\n\nWait, 1920 *11 = 21120. 21120 /144 = 146.666..., which is 440/3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) approaches 440/3 as t\u2192infty.\n\nBut what happens as t approaches 2500/144 from the right? Let's compute the limit as t approaches 2500/144+.\n\nAt t approaching 2500/144 from above, denominator 144t -2500 approaches zero from the positive side, and numerator 1920*(11t + 120 ) approaches 1920*(11*(2500/144) + 120 ).\n\nCompute 11*(2500/144) = 27500/144 \u2248191.458.\n\n191.458 +120 =311.458.\n\nSo, numerator approaches 1920*311.458 \u22481920*311.458 \u2248 approx 1920*300=576,000, 1920*11.458\u224822,000, so total\u2248598,000.\n\nDenominator approaches 0 from positive side, so BD\u00b2(t) approaches +infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) has a vertical asymptote at t=2500/144.\n\nSo, the function BD\u00b2(t) is defined for t>2500/144, and as t increases from just above 2500/144 to infinity, BD\u00b2(t) decreases from +infty to 440/3.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) is a decreasing function for t >2500/144.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 440/3, and it can get arbitrarily large as t approaches 2500/144 from above.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made as large as possible, approaching infinity, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the minimal value of BD\u00b2, since BD\u00b2 is at least 440/3, but can be larger. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 440/3, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 440/3.\n\nWait, but wait: if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 440/3 and as large as infinity, then for any number less than 440/3, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that number. So the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum, which is 440/3.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, we're looking for a number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for every rhombus, and L is as large as possible.\n\nSo, L is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than L, and L is the greatest such lower bound.\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 approaches 440/3 as t approaches infinity, and for any t beyond a certain point, BD\u00b2 is just a bit larger than 440/3. So, the infimum is 440/3, meaning that 440/3 is the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Since BD\u00b2 can get as small as just above 440/3, then for any L less than 440/3, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than L, right? No, wait, because BD\u00b2 approaches 440/3 from above as t increases. So, the minimal value BD\u00b2 approaches is 440/3, but never goes below it. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 440/3. Wait, but when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 440/3, but for finite t, BD\u00b2 is larger than 440/3.\n\nWait, but wait, when t is very large, BD\u00b2 is approaching 440/3, which is approximately 146.666...\n\nBut earlier, when t approaches 2500/144 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, but as t increases beyond that point, BD\u00b2 decreases towards 440/3.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 can take any value from just above 440/3 up to infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal value BD\u00b2 can take is 440/3, and it can be as large as possible.\n\nSo, the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the minimal value of BD\u00b2, which is 440/3, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 440/3.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is 440/3, then any number less than 440/3 would not satisfy the condition for all rhombi, because there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is equal to 440/3. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 440/3 itself.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 440/3, then any number less than 440/3 would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the problem is asking for the greatest such number, which would be 440/3. Because 440/3 is the minimal value of BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than or equal to all BD\u00b2 would be 440/3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIf BD\u00b2 can be as small as 440/3, then for any L less than 440/3, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 =440/3, which is greater than L. But we need a number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the number L must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 440/3. Because if L is less than 440/3, then for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to 440/3, so L is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but if L is the greatest such number, then L must be equal to the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 440/3. Because 440/3 is the greatest lower bound. So, L can't be higher than 440/3, because BD\u00b2 can be as low as 440/3.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 440/3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, for example, if I take L=440/3, then for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 440/3, so L=440/3 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2\". So, does 440/3 count as less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi? Well, for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=440/3, 440/3 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, perhaps I need the supremum of all L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nIn that case, the supremum would be 440/3, because for any epsilon >0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=440/3 + epsilon, so L can approach 440/3 from below.\n\nWait, no, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 440/3, so L must be less than 440/3. So, the supremum of such L is 440/3, but L can't actually reach 440/3 because for that L=440/3, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2=440/3, so L is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the supremum of all L where L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is 440/3.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nWe have that BD\u00b2 approaches 440/3 as t approaches infinity. So, for any epsilon >0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 440/3 + epsilon. But BD\u00b2 can't be less than 440/3 because as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 440/3 from above.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, earlier I thought BD\u00b2 approaches 440/3 from above as t approaches infinity, but let me check that.\n\nWait, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2(t) approaches 1920*(11 t)/(144 t) )= 1920*11/144 = (1920/144)*11.\n\n1920 \u00f7144 = 13.333...=40/3.\n\nSo, 40/3 *11= 440/3\u2248146.666...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 440/3 as t approaches infinity. So, for t very large, BD\u00b2 is just slightly above 440/3. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 440/3 from above. So, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 440/3, and it can be as large as desired.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 440/3.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. That would be the infimum, 440/3, because for any L less than 440/3, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than L, right?\n\nWait, no, wait. No, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 440/3. So, for any L less than 440/3, L is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Because BD\u00b2 is at least 440/3, so if L is less than 440/3, then L is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest such L. So, the greatest L is the supremum of all such L's, which is 440/3, because you can approach 440/3 from below. For any L <440/3, there's no rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than L, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 440/3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if L is less than 440/3, then since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 440/3, which is greater than L, then L is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 440/3, because that's the smallest value BD\u00b2 can take. So, any number less than 440/3 would also be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 440/3 itself.\n\nWait, but wait, 440/3 is the minimal value of BD\u00b2. So, for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 440/3. So, 440/3 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 440/3 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because when BD\u00b2 is exactly 440/3, 440/3 is equal to BD\u00b2. So, the number L must be strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nIn that case, the greatest such L would be just below 440/3, but since we're looking for the greatest real number, it's 440/3. But that's not possible because L can't be equal to 440/3. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of limits. The infimum of BD\u00b2 is 440/3, which is the greatest lower bound. So, for any epsilon >0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 440/3 + epsilon. But since we need a number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, L must be less than or equal to the infimum. But the infimum is 440/3, so L can approach 440/3 from below, but can't reach it. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 440/3.\n\nWait, but if L is equal to 440/3, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=440/3, L is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, L must be less than 440/3. Therefore, the greatest L is just less than 440/3, but in real numbers, there's no maximum, only the supremum. So, the supremum is 440/3.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, technically, such a number L doesn't exist because for any L you choose less than 440/3, I can find a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is as close to 440/3 as I like, making L less than BD\u00b2. But if I set L=440/3, then there's a rhombus where BD\u00b2=440/3, so L is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 440/3, but the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all such L where L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 440/3 from above, the supremum of L is 440/3. Therefore, the answer is 440/3.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 440/3, which is approximately 146.666...\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) and a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) centered at the origin with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. \n\nHmm, let me start by recalling what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Oh wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I think they are. Let me double-check: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's correct. So, that's an important property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is a point on the hyperbola, then the opposite vertex C must be the reflection of A through the origin. Similarly, B and D are reflections through the origin.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoints are the same. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y), right? Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). \n\nSo, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q). \n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach this. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, perhaps I can parametrize the points.\n\nWait, let me consider the diagonals. Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since the origin is the midpoint, the coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D. \n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So, the diagonals AC and BD must be perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. \n\nWait, but AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q). \n\nFor them to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0. \n\nWhich simplifies to 4xp + 4yq = 0, so xp + yq = 0. \n\nSo, the condition is xp + yq = 0. \n\nOkay, so that's one condition. Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, for A(x, y), we have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Similarly for B(p, q), p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, I need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the length of the diagonal from B to D. Since D is (-p, -q), the vector BD is from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q), which is (-2p, -2q). So, the length of BD is sqrt[ (-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2 ] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 is [2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). \n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, I need to find the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2, but wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombuses. So, I need to find the minimum possible BD\u00b2, and the answer would be the greatest number less than this minimum, which would be the minimum itself if it's attainable, but perhaps if it's not, it would be approaching it.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimum BD\u00b2 is 48? Let me think. Because the hyperbola is given by x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, for any point (p, q) on the hyperbola, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1. \n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 20(1 + q\u00b2/24) = 20 + (5/6)q\u00b2. \n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4[20 + (5/6)q\u00b2 + q\u00b2] = 4[20 + (11/6)q\u00b2]. \n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 = 4*20 + 4*(11/6)q\u00b2 = 80 + (44/6)q\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3)q\u00b2. \n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is 80 + (22/3)q\u00b2. Since q\u00b2 is non-negative, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when q\u00b2 is as small as possible. \n\nBut q\u00b2 can't be zero because if q\u00b2=0, then from the hyperbola equation p\u00b2/20 =1, so p\u00b2=20. Then point B would be (sqrt(20), 0), and point D would be (-sqrt(20), 0). But then the rhombus would collapse into a line along the x-axis, which is not possible because a rhombus needs four distinct points. So, q\u00b2 must be greater than zero.\n\nWait, but can q\u00b2 be zero? Let me see. If q=0, then from the hyperbola equation, p\u00b2 =20. So, point B would be (sqrt(20),0). But then point D is (-sqrt(20),0). So, points A and C would be somewhere else. Let me think: if B is (sqrt(20),0), then the diagonal BD is along the x-axis, length 2*sqrt(20). The other diagonal AC must be perpendicular to BD, so it must be along the y-axis. So, points A and C would be (0, y) and (0, -y), but do these points lie on the hyperbola?\n\nPlugging into the hyperbola equation: 0\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 \u2192 -y\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 y\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible. So, points A and C can't be on the hyperbola if q=0. Therefore, q cannot be zero, so q\u00b2 must be positive. So, BD\u00b2 is minimized when q\u00b2 is as small as possible, but greater than zero. \n\nBut wait, perhaps I can find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 by using the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular. Earlier, I found that xp + yq =0. So, let me use that condition.\n\nSince A(x,y) and B(p,q) are points on the hyperbola, so x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nAlso, xp + yq =0.\n\nI think I can parametrize the points. Let me parametrize point A as (x, y) and point B as (p, q). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, and xp + yq =0, perhaps I can express p and q in terms of x and y, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the points using hyperbola parameters. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a standard parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates (x, y) and (p, q) such that xp + yq =0.\n\nWait, maybe I can use vectors. Let me think of points A and B as vectors from the origin. Then the condition is that vectors A and B are such that A \u00b7 B =0 (since xp + yq =0 is the dot product). So, vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, if OA and OB are perpendicular, then points A and B lie on the hyperbola and their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can use that to relate x, y, p, q.\n\nSince OA \u00b7 OB = 0, so xp + yq =0.\n\nAlso, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nI need to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, I can express BD\u00b2 as 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSince OA and OB are perpendicular, and points A and B lie on the hyperbola, perhaps I can find the minimal value of p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nSo, let me consider that.\n\nLet me denote S = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2 =4S.\n\nI need to find the minimal S such that p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1 and xp + yq =0, with x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can express x and y in terms of p and q.\n\nWait, from xp + yq=0, I can write y = (-xp)/q, assuming q \u22600.\n\nThen, substituting into the hyperbola equation for A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2p\u00b2)/(q\u00b2) ] /24 =1.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) =1.\n\nFactor out x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 [ 1/20 - p\u00b2/(24 q\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, since OA and OB are perpendicular, perhaps I can use the concept of reciprocal vectors or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers to minimize S = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 subject to the constraint p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1 and xp + yq=0, but that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use parametric equations for the hyperbola.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing point A as (x, y) = (a\u221a20 sec\u03b8, b\u221a24 tan\u03b8), where a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24. Wait, no, more accurately, the standard parametrization for hyperbola is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So, for our hyperbola, a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6. So, point A can be written as (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6).\n\nBut since OA and OB are perpendicular, their dot product is zero: (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6) + (2\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) =0.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(4*5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) + (4*6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6) =0.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, let's write this as:\n\n5/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) +6 (sin\u03b8/sin\u03c6) =0.\n\nWait, no, actually, tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8, so tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 sin\u03c6).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of sine and cosine.\n\nWait, let me write the equation again:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nWhich is 5/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) +6 (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6) )=0.\n\nSo,\n\n5/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) +6 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) )=0.\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n[5 + 6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 ] / (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) )=0.\n\nSo, the numerator must be zero:\n\n5 +6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0.\n\nSo, 6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, okay, that's a condition between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nNow, I need to find the minimal value of S = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, where p =2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, q=2\u221a6 tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, S = (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6)^2 + (2\u221a6 tan\u03c6)^2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSimplify S:\n\n20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe can express this in terms of sin and cos:\n\n20 (1/cos\u00b2\u03c6) +24 (sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6) = [20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, maybe we can express this in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6 from earlier, perhaps we can express sin\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, from 5 +6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nBut we can also express S in terms of \u03c6, and then perhaps find the minimal S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6 that allows us to express S in terms of a single variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me denote t = \u03b8, so then \u03c6 is such that sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin t).\n\nBut sin\u03c6 must be between -1 and 1, so | (-5)/(6 sin t) | \u22641 \u2192 |5/(6 sin t)| \u22641 \u2192 |sin t| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, |sin t| \u22655/6. That means t is in regions where sin t is \u22655/6 or \u2264-5/6.\n\nSo, t is in [arcsin(5/6), \u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)] or similar in other quadrants.\n\nHmm, but this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of sin\u03c6 and then use the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 to relate them.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Since OA and OB are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nWait, point A is (x, y), so its slope is y/x. Point B is (p, q), so its slope is q/p. Since OA and OB are perpendicular, (y/x)(q/p) = -1.\n\nSo, yq/(xp) = -1 \u2192 yq = -xp \u2192 yq + xp =0. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo, same condition.\n\nBut perhaps I can express y in terms of x, p, q: y = (-xp)/q.\n\nNow, substituting into the hyperbola equation for A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(q\u00b2) ] /24 =1.\n\nWhich simplifies to x\u00b2 [1/20 - p\u00b2/(24 q\u00b2)] =1.\n\nBut this seems a bit involved. Maybe instead, I can express x in terms of p and q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that points A and B are on the hyperbola and OA perpendicular to OB. So, perhaps I can consider the equation of the hyperbola and the condition for perpendicularity.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider the product of the equations of OA and OB.\n\nWait, no, perhaps using the concept of reciprocal vectors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of the director circle, but for hyperbola, the director circle is defined as the locus of points from which the tangents are perpendicular. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that since OA and OB are perpendicular, the points A and B lie on a circle centered at the origin with radius r, such that the product of their coordinates satisfies the hyperbola equation.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to minimize S = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 subject to the constraints p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1 and xp + yq=0, where x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nThis might be a bit involved, but let's try.\n\nWe can set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + \u03bb (p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 -1) + \u03bc (xp + yq).\n\nBut we have another constraint x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWait, but this might get too complicated with multiple variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express x and y in terms of p and q using the condition xp + yq=0.\n\nFrom xp + yq=0, we have y = (-xp)/q.\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation for A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 x\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) =1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 [1/20 - p\u00b2/(24 q\u00b2)] =1.\n\nHmm, but we also have p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nLet me denote this as equation (1): p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nI can solve equation (1) for p\u00b2: p\u00b2 =20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nNow, substituting p\u00b2 into the expression for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 [1/20 - (20(1 + q\u00b2/24))/(24 q\u00b2)] =1.\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets:\n\n1/20 - [20(1 + q\u00b2/24)]/(24 q\u00b2).\n\nFirst, compute [20(1 + q\u00b2/24)]/(24 q\u00b2):\n\n= [20/(24 q\u00b2)] * (1 + q\u00b2/24)\n\n= (5/(6 q\u00b2)) * (1 + q\u00b2/24)\n\n= 5/(6 q\u00b2) + 5/(6 q\u00b2)*(q\u00b2/24)\n\n= 5/(6 q\u00b2) + 5/(144)\n\nSo, the term inside the brackets becomes:\n\n1/20 - [5/(6 q\u00b2) +5/(144)].\n\nHmm, so:\n\n1/20 -5/(6 q\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the constants. 20, 6, 144. Let's see, 144 is a multiple of 20? No. 144=16*9, 20=4*5. So, the least common multiple (LCM) would be 4*5*9*4= 720? Wait, 20=2\u00b2*5, 6=2*3, 144=2^4*3^2. So, LCM is 2^4 *3^2 *5= 16*9*5=720.\n\nSo, converting each term:\n\n1/20 = 36/720,\n\n5/(6 q\u00b2) = (5 * 120)/(720 q\u00b2) = 600/(720 q\u00b2),\n\n5/144 = 25/720.\n\nSo, the term becomes:\n\n36/720 - 600/(720 q\u00b2) -25/720.\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n36 -25 =11, so 11/720 - 600/(720 q\u00b2).\n\nSo, the entire expression for x\u00b2 is:\n\nx\u00b2 [11/720 - 600/(720 q\u00b2)] =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 [ (11 q\u00b2 -600)/(720 q\u00b2) ) ] =1.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 = (720 q\u00b2)/(11 q\u00b2 -600).\n\nHmm, but x\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator must be positive: 11 q\u00b2 -600 >0 \u2192 q\u00b2 >600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 must be greater than 600/11.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that q\u00b2 can be as small as possible, but now it seems that q\u00b2 must be greater than 600/11. That's interesting.\n\nWait, but from the hyperbola equation p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1, we have p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24). So, p\u00b2 increases as q\u00b2 increases.\n\nBut according to this, q\u00b2 must be greater than 600/11, which is approximately 54.545.\n\nSo, the minimal possible q\u00b2 is 600/11, which would make the denominator zero. Wait, but if q\u00b2 approaches 600/11 from above, then x\u00b2 approaches infinity, which isn't possible because x\u00b2 is part of the hyperbola equation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me check.\n\nWait, let me recompute the term inside the brackets:\n\n1/20 - [20(1 + q\u00b2/24)]/(24 q\u00b2).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n20(1 + q\u00b2/24) =20 + (20 q\u00b2)/24 =20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, [20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 ]/(24 q\u00b2) = [20/(24 q\u00b2)] + [5 q\u00b2/(6*24 q\u00b2)] = (5)/(6 q\u00b2) +5/(144).\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 1/20 - [5/(6 q\u00b2) +5/144] = 1/20 -5/(6 q\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nThen, converting to 720 denominator:\n\n1/20 =36/720,\n\n5/(6 q\u00b2) = (5*120)/(720 q\u00b2)=600/(720 q\u00b2),\n\n5/144=25/720.\n\nSo, 36/720 -600/(720 q\u00b2) -25/720 = (36-25)/720 -600/(720 q\u00b2) =11/720 -600/(720 q\u00b2).\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = [11 q\u00b2 -600]/(720 q\u00b2) )^{-1} ?\n\nWait, no: x\u00b2 = [720 q\u00b2] / (11 q\u00b2 -600).\n\nSo, for x\u00b2 to be positive, denominator must be positive: 11 q\u00b2 -600 >0 \u2192 q\u00b2>600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 must be greater than 600/11. So, the minimal possible q\u00b2 is just above 600/11.\n\nBut wait, let's see what happens when q\u00b2 approaches 600/11 from above.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 approaches infinity, which is not possible because point A lies on the hyperbola, so x\u00b2 must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWait, but if x\u00b2 approaches infinity, then y\u00b2 would also approach infinity because y = (-xp)/q. Hmm, but this suggests that there's a minimum value for q\u00b2, which is 600/11.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because earlier, I thought that q\u00b2 could be as small as possible, but now it's clear that q\u00b2 must be greater than 600/11.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the condition comes from ensuring that x\u00b2 is positive. So, if q\u00b2 must be greater than 600/11, then the minimal q\u00b2 is 600/11, making x\u00b2 approach infinity, which isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps there's a lower bound on q\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let's think physically. If points A and B are on the hyperbola and their position vectors are perpendicular, then there must be a minimal distance for B from the origin. So, perhaps the minimal S is achieved when q\u00b2=600/11, but that would require x\u00b2 to be infinity, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the minimal S occurs when x\u00b2 is minimal, which would correspond to q\u00b2 being as small as possible.\n\nWait, but according to the equation, q\u00b2 must be greater than 600/11. So, the minimal possible q\u00b2 is just above 600/11, making x\u00b2 very large, which isn't possible because the hyperbola extends to infinity. So, perhaps the minimal S occurs as q\u00b2 approaches 600/11 from above, making x\u00b2 approach infinity. But in reality, there must be a minimal S, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the minimal S is achieved when the vectors OA and OB are such that the rhombus is symmetric in a particular way.\n\nWait, let's consider the case where the rhombus is such that the diagonals are the axes of the hyperbola. Wait, but the hyperbola's transverse axis is along the x-axis, and conjugate axis along the y-axis.\n\nBut in that case, points A and C would be on the x-axis, and points B and D on the y-axis, but as we saw earlier, points on the y-axis can't be on the hyperbola because x would be zero, leading to y\u00b2=-24, which is impossible.\n\nSo, that's not possible. So, the diagonals can't align with the axes of the hyperbola.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can consider that the diagonals are not aligned with the axes but are rotated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the condition that OA and OB are perpendicular and both lie on the hyperbola, and find the minimal S=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for points A and B on the hyperbola with OA perpendicular to OB, the minimal value of S=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 can be found by optimizing.\n\nLet me try to express S in terms of a single variable.\n\nFrom the condition 5 +6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=0, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me express sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nNow, since sin\u03c6 must be between -1 and 1, |sin\u03b8| must be \u22655/6, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 \u22655/6 or sin\u03b8 \u2264-5/6.\n\nNow, let's express S in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom earlier, S = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut since \u03c6 is related to \u03b8 via sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8), perhaps I can express sec\u00b2\u03c6 and tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, let me compute cos\u03c6 and sin\u03c6.\n\nWe have sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nSo, cos\u03c6 = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) = sqrt(1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)).\n\nSo, sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1/[1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] = [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8]/[36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25].\n\nSimilarly, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(cos\u00b2\u03c6) = [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)]/[1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] =25/[36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25].\n\nSo, S=20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 =20*(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25) +24*(25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nCombine terms:\n\n[20*36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +24*25]/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n20*36=720, 720 sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\n24*25=600.\n\nSo, numerator=720 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +600.\n\nDenominator=36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25.\n\nSo, S=(720 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +600)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nHmm, now I can write S as:\n\nS= [720 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +600]/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 720 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +600 = 120*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5).\n\nDenominator:36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25= (6 sin\u03b8 -5)(6 sin\u03b8 +5).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can perform polynomial division or simplify.\n\nAlternatively, let me set t=sin\u00b2\u03b8. Then, S becomes:\n\nS= [720 t +600]/(36 t -25).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nS= [720 t +600]/(36 t -25).\n\nLet me perform the division:\n\nDivide 720t +600 by 36t -25.\n\nDivide 720t by 36t: 20. Multiply 36t -25 by 20: 720t -500.\n\nSubtract from numerator: (720t +600) - (720t -500) = 1100.\n\nSo, S=20 + 1100/(36t -25).\n\nNow, since t=sin\u00b2\u03b8 and |sin\u03b8|\u22655/6, then t\u226525/36\u22480.694.\n\nSo, 36t -25=36t -25\u226536*(25/36) -25=25-25=0. But since t>25/36 (because sin\u03b8 can't be exactly 5/6, because then denominator would be zero, leading to S approaching infinity), we have 36t -25>0.\n\nSo, S=20 +1100/(36t -25).\n\nTo minimize S, we need to maximize the denominator (36t -25), which occurs when t is as large as possible. But t can be as large as 1, since sin\u00b2\u03b8 \u22641.\n\nWait, but t is sin\u00b2\u03b8, which can go up to 1. So, when t=1, 36t -25=36-25=11. So, S=20 +1100/11=20+100=120.\n\nWhen t approaches 25/36 from above, 36t-25 approaches zero, so S approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal value of S is 120, achieved when t=1, i.e., sin\u03b8=\u00b11.\n\nBut wait, when sin\u03b8=1, then \u03b8=\u03c0/2, so point A would be (0, y), but as we saw earlier, that's impossible because x=0 would lead to y\u00b2=-24, which isn't possible. So, perhaps t cannot be 1.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, when sin\u03b8=1, point A would be at (0, y), which is not on the hyperbola. So, the minimal value of S=120 is not achievable because it would require point A to be at (0,y), which is impossible.\n\nSo, the minimal S is greater than 120.\n\nWait, but when t approaches 1 from below, S approaches 120 from above. So, the infimum of S is 120, but it's not achievable.\n\nSo, the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2 is 4S, which approaches 4*120=480, but it's not achievable. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check when t approaches 1, what happens to point A.\n\nWhen sin\u03b8 approaches 1, point A's y-coordinate approaches y=2\u221a6 tan\u03b8. But tan\u03b8 approaches infinity as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2. So, point A would approach (0, infinity), but that's not on the hyperbola. So, perhaps the minimal S is higher.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, when t approaches 1, S approaches 120, but point A can't be at (0, y). So, maybe the minimal S is higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me think again.\n\nWait, I parametrized point A as (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). But when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, sec\u03b8 approaches infinity, so x approaches infinity, which is possible on the hyperbola. Wait, but when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, tan\u03b8 approaches infinity, so y approaches infinity as well. Hmm, but let me check if such points are valid.\n\nWait, point A is (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). So, as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, sec\u03b8 approaches infinity, and tan\u03b8 approaches infinity. So, x approaches infinity, and y approaches infinity as well. So, point A is on the hyperbola, but very far away.\n\nSo, in that case, S approaches 120, but is that achievable? Well, since \u03b8 can approach \u03c0/2, S can approach 120, making BD\u00b2 approach 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not achieved. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that when t approaches 25/36 from above, S approaches infinity, but when t approaches 1, S approaches 120. So, the minimal S is 120, achieved when t=1, but that's not possible because point A would be at (0, y), which isn't on the hyperbola. So, perhaps the minimal S is greater than 120.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me check the parametrization again.\n\nWait, the standard parametrization for hyperbola is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), but this parametrization covers only one branch of the hyperbola. Wait, actually, for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, the parametrization (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8) covers the right branch (x>0), and (-a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8) covers the left branch.\n\nBut in our case, points A and C are on opposite branches because the origin is the midpoint. So, point A is on the right branch, and point C is on the left branch.\n\nBut when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, sec\u03b8 approaches infinity, so x approaches infinity, which is valid for the right branch. So, perhaps point A can indeed approach (infty, infty), making S approach 120.\n\nWait, but when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, what happens to point B?\n\nPoint B is parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6), and from earlier, sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nSo, as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, sin\u03b8 approaches 1, so sin\u03c6 approaches (-5)/(6*1) = -5/6. So, \u03c6 approaches arcsin(-5/6), which is in the fourth quadrant.\n\nSo, as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, \u03c6 approaches arcsin(-5/6), which is a fixed angle.\n\nSo, point B approaches (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6), with \u03c6 fixed. So, point B approaches a fixed point on the hyperbola, and point D approaches the reflection of B through the origin.\n\nSo, in this case, BD\u00b2 approaches 4S=4*120=480.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered t approaching 25/36 from above, S approaches infinity, which would correspond to point B approaching a point where q\u00b2 approaches 600/11, which is approximately 54.545.\n\nWait, but according to the parametrization, when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, S approaches 120, which is finite. So, perhaps the minimal S is 120, and BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut I need to confirm if BD\u00b2 can indeed approach 480.\n\nWait, but let me think about the case when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2. Point A approaches (infty, infty), and point B approaches a fixed point. So, the rhombus becomes very \"stretched\" along the x and y axes, but the diagonal BD remains finite, approaching 480.\n\nSo, perhaps 480 is the infimum of BD\u00b2, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me check another case. Suppose \u03b8 is such that sin\u03b8=\u221a(25/36 + \u03b5), where \u03b5 is a small positive number. Then, t=sin\u00b2\u03b8=25/36 + \u03b5.\n\nThen, S= [720*(25/36 + \u03b5) +600]/[36*(25/36 + \u03b5) -25].\n\nCompute numerator:720*(25/36)=720*(5/6)=600, plus 720\u03b5, plus 600. So, numerator=600+720\u03b5+600=1200+720\u03b5.\n\nDenominator:36*(25/36)=25, plus 36\u03b5, minus25=36\u03b5.\n\nSo, S= (1200 +720\u03b5)/(36\u03b5)= [1200/(36\u03b5)] + [720\u03b5/(36\u03b5)] = (100/3\u03b5) +20.\n\nAs \u03b5 approaches zero from above, S approaches infinity. So, in this case, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but earlier, when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, S approaches 120. So, there are two cases: when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, S approaches 120, and when \u03b8 approaches arcsin(5/6), S approaches infinity.\n\nWait, this suggests that the minimal value of S is 120, achieved when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 4*120=480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm if BD\u00b2 can indeed be made arbitrarily close to 480.\n\nYes, because as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, point A moves towards infinity, and point B approaches a fixed point, making BD\u00b2 approach 480.\n\nThus, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought about q\u00b2 approaching 600/11, which is about 54.545, I thought that BD\u00b2 would approach 4*54.545\u2248218.18, but that seems conflicting with the current conclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I considered the condition leading to q\u00b2>600/11. Let me check.\n\nFrom earlier, when I expressed x\u00b2 in terms of q\u00b2, I got x\u00b2= [720 q\u00b2]/(11 q\u00b2 -600).\n\nSo, for x\u00b2 to be positive, denominator must be positive:11 q\u00b2 -600>0 \u2192 q\u00b2>600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 must be greater than 54.545.\n\nBut according to the parametrization approach, when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, q\u00b2 approaches a finite value, which would be less than 54.545, which contradicts the earlier result.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization approach.\n\nWait, let me compute S when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2.\n\nFrom the parametrization, S=20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nAs \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, sin\u03b8 approaches 1, so sin\u03c6= (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8) approaches -5/6.\n\nSo, \u03c6 approaches arcsin(-5/6), which is in the fourth quadrant.\n\nSo, cos\u03c6= sqrt(1 - (25/36))=sqrt(11/36)=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nSo, sec\u03c6=1/cos\u03c6=6/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, sec\u00b2\u03c6=36/11.\n\nSimilarly, tan\u03c6=sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6=(-5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)= -5/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6=25/11.\n\nSo, S=20*(36/11) +24*(25/11)= (720/11)+(600/11)=1320/11=120.\n\nSo, S=120, which corresponds to q\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03c6=24*(25/11)=600/11\u224854.545.\n\nWait, so when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, q\u00b2 approaches 600/11, which is approximately 54.545, not higher.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4S=480.\n\nWait, but from the earlier equation, when q\u00b2 approaches 600/11 from above, x\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, when q\u00b2=600/11, x\u00b2 would be undefined, but as q\u00b2 approaches 600/11 from above, x\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, in the parametrization approach, when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, q\u00b2 approaches 600/11, which is the minimal possible q\u00b2, making S approach 120, and BD\u00b2 approach 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not achievable because q\u00b2 can't be exactly 600/11, but can approach it. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought about q\u00b2 approaching 600/11 from above, I thought that BD\u00b2 approaches 4*(600/11 + something), but that's not correct because BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), and p\u00b2 is not just q\u00b2; it's related through the hyperbola equation.\n\nWait, but from the parametrization, when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, q\u00b2 approaches 600/11, and p\u00b2 approaches 20*(1 + (600/11)/24)=20*(1 + 600/(11*24))=20*(1 + 25/(11*6))=20*(1 +25/66)=20*(91/66)=1820/66=910/33\u224827.575.\n\nSo, p\u00b2\u224827.575, q\u00b2\u224854.545.\n\nSo, S=p\u00b2+q\u00b2\u224827.575+54.545\u224882.12, which contradicts the earlier calculation where S=120.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting results here. There must be a mistake.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the parametrization approach. Because when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, point B approaches a fixed point where q\u00b2=600/11, but point A approaches infinity, making x\u00b2 approach infinity, which would require y to approach infinity as well.\n\nBut according to the parametrization, S=120 when \u03b8=\u03c0/2, which would correspond to q\u00b2=600/11 and p\u00b2=20*(1 + q\u00b2/24)=20*(1 + (600/11)/24)=20*(1 + 25/(11*6))=20*(1 +25/66)=20*(91/66)=910/33\u224827.575.\n\nSo, p\u00b2\u224827.575, q\u00b2\u224854.545, so S\u224882.12, but according to the parametrization approach, S=120.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I made a mistake in the parametrization approach.\n\nWait, no, I think the mistake is that in the parametrization approach, S= p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6=120 when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, but from the hyperbola equation, p\u00b2=20*(1 + q\u00b2/24). So, if q\u00b2=600/11, then p\u00b2=20*(1 + (600/11)/24)=20*(1 + 25/66)=20*(91/66)=910/33\u224827.575.\n\nSo, S=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=910/33 +600/11=910/33 + 1800/33=2710/33\u224882.12, which contradicts the parametrization approach result of S=120.\n\nSo, clearly, there's a mistake in the parametrization approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in expressing S in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the parametrization approach.\n\nI parametrized point A as (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8), and point B as (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6).\n\nFrom the condition that OA and OB are perpendicular, I derived that 5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0.\n\nThen, I expressed this as 5/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) +6 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6)=0, leading to 5 +6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=0.\n\nThen, I expressed sin\u03c6= (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nThen, I expressed S= p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, no, the parametrization is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting.\n\nWait, let me compute S when sin\u03b8 approaches 1.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8=1, so \u03b8=\u03c0/2.\n\nThen, sin\u03c6= (-5)/(6*1)= -5/6.\n\nSo, cos\u03c6= sqrt(1 - (25/36))=sqrt(11/36)=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nSo, sec\u03c6=1/cos\u03c6=6/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, sec\u00b2\u03c6=36/11.\n\nSimilarly, tan\u03c6=sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6= (-5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)= -5/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6=25/11.\n\nSo, S=20*(36/11) +24*(25/11)= (720/11)+(600/11)=1320/11=120.\n\nBut according to the hyperbola equation, when q\u00b2=600/11, p\u00b2=20*(1 + q\u00b2/24)=20*(1 + (600/11)/24)=20*(1 +25/(11*6))=20*(1 +25/66)=20*(91/66)=910/33\u224827.575.\n\nSo, S=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=910/33 +600/11=910/33 + 1800/33=2710/33\u224882.12, which is less than 120.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's a mistake in the parametrization approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the parametrization is incorrect because when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, point A is at (infty, infty), but in reality, when \u03b8=\u03c0/2, point A is not on the hyperbola because x=0 isn't allowed. So, perhaps the parametrization approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that OA and OB are perpendicular, leading to a specific relationship between points A and B, but perhaps I need to approach the problem differently.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, and points A and C are reflections through the origin, as are B and D, perhaps I can consider that the rhombus is determined by two points A and B on the hyperbola, with OA perpendicular to OB.\n\nSo, the condition is OA \u00b7 OB =0.\n\nWe can express this as x p + y q =0.\n\nGiven that A(x,y) and B(p,q) lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nTo find the minimal value of p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x p + y q =0.\n\n2. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\n3. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nLet me consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nDefine f(p, q) = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\ng(x,y,p,q) = x p + y q =0,\n\nh(x,y)=x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1,\n\nk(p,q)=p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nBut this involves multiple variables, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express x and y in terms of p and q using the condition x p + y q =0.\n\nFrom x p + y q =0, we can express y = (-x p)/q.\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation for A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(q\u00b2) ] /24 =1.\n\nMultiply through by 24 q\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n12 q\u00b2 x\u00b2 - x\u00b2 p\u00b2 =24 q\u00b2.\n\nFactor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 (12 q\u00b2 - p\u00b2) =24 q\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2= (24 q\u00b2)/(12 q\u00b2 - p\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, from the hyperbola equation for B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nSubstituting into x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2= (24 q\u00b2)/(12 q\u00b2 -20(1 + q\u00b2/24)).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n12 q\u00b2 -20 - (20 q\u00b2)/24=12 q\u00b2 -20 - (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 6:\n\n= (72 q\u00b2)/6 -120/6 - (5 q\u00b2)/6\n\n= [72 q\u00b2 -5 q\u00b2 -120]/6\n\n= [67 q\u00b2 -120]/6.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2= (24 q\u00b2) / [ (67 q\u00b2 -120)/6 ] = (24 q\u00b2 *6)/(67 q\u00b2 -120)=144 q\u00b2/(67 q\u00b2 -120).\n\nSo, x\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator must be positive:\n\n67 q\u00b2 -120 >0 \u2192 q\u00b2>120/67\u22481.791.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 must be greater than approximately 1.791.\n\nNow, from the hyperbola equation for B, p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, p\u00b2=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2=20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4[20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6]=80 + (44 q\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 q\u00b2)/3.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2, which is equivalent to minimizing q\u00b2.\n\nFrom earlier, q\u00b2>120/67\u22481.791.\n\nSo, the minimal q\u00b2 is just above 120/67, making BD\u00b2 approach 80 + (22*(120/67))/3.\n\nCompute:\n\n(22*(120/67))/3= (2640/67)/3=880/67\u224813.134.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +13.134\u224893.134.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier result where BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nHmm, so which approach is correct?\n\nWait, in this approach, I expressed x\u00b2 in terms of q\u00b2 and found that q\u00b2 must be greater than 120/67\u22481.791, leading to BD\u00b2 approaching approximately 93.134.\n\nBut earlier, using the parametrization approach, I found BD\u00b2 approaching 480.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nLet me check the substitution again.\n\nFrom the condition x p + y q=0, we expressed y= (-x p)/q.\n\nSubstituting into hyperbola equation for A:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(q\u00b2) ]/24=1.\n\nMultiply through by 24 q\u00b2:\n\n12 q\u00b2 x\u00b2 - x\u00b2 p\u00b2=24 q\u00b2.\n\nFactor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2(12 q\u00b2 -p\u00b2)=24 q\u00b2.\n\nSo, x\u00b2=24 q\u00b2/(12 q\u00b2 -p\u00b2).\n\nFrom hyperbola equation for B: p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nSubstituting into x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2=24 q\u00b2/(12 q\u00b2 -20(1 + q\u00b2/24)).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n12 q\u00b2 -20 - (20 q\u00b2)/24.\n\nConvert to common denominator 24:\n\n= (288 q\u00b2 -480 -20 q\u00b2)/24\n\n= (268 q\u00b2 -480)/24.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2=24 q\u00b2 / [ (268 q\u00b2 -480)/24 ] = (24 q\u00b2 *24)/(268 q\u00b2 -480)=576 q\u00b2/(268 q\u00b2 -480).\n\nSo, denominator must be positive:\n\n268 q\u00b2 -480>0 \u2192 q\u00b2>480/268\u22481.791.\n\nSo, q\u00b2>\u22481.791.\n\nThen, p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24)=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2=20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4*(20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6)=80 + (44 q\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 q\u00b2)/3.\n\nTo minimize BD\u00b2, we minimize q\u00b2, which approaches 480/268\u22481.791.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22*(480/268))/3.\n\nCompute:\n\n22*(480/268)= (22*480)/268= (10560)/268\u224839.403.\n\nDivide by 3:\u224813.134.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches\u224880+13.134\u224893.134.\n\nWait, so according to this approach, BD\u00b2 approaches approximately 93.134, which is less than the earlier result of 480.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nI think the mistake was in the parametrization approach where I assumed \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, leading to S=120, but in reality, when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, point B approaches a fixed point with q\u00b2=600/11\u224854.545, which is much larger than 120/67\u22481.791.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is approximately 93.134, which is 80 + (22*(480/268))/3.\n\nWait, but let me compute this exactly.\n\nCompute 480/268=120/67.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 approaches 120/67.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=80 + (22*(120/67))/3=80 + (2640/67)/3=80 + 880/67.\n\nCompute 880/67\u224813.134.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +13.134\u224893.134.\n\nBut wait, 880/67=13.134.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +13.134=93.134.\n\nBut 80 +13.134=93.134.\n\nBut 880/67=13.134 exactly?\n\nWait, 67*13=871, 67*13.134\u2248871 +67*0.134\u2248871+8.978\u2248880.\n\nYes, so 880/67\u224813.134.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +13.134=93.134.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is approximately 93.134, which is 80 +880/67=80 +13 +1/67=93 +1/67\u224893.0149.\n\nWait, exactly, 880/67=13 + (880 -67*13)/67=13 + (880-871)/67=13 +9/67=13 +9/67=13.13423884...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +13.13423884=93.13423884.\n\nBut I need to express this as an exact fraction.\n\nCompute 880/67=13 +9/67.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +13 +9/67=93 +9/67=93 9/67.\n\nSo, as a fraction, BD\u00b2 approaches 93 +9/67= (93*67 +9)/67=(6231 +9)/67=6240/67.\n\nSo, 6240 divided by 67.\n\nCompute 67*93=67*(90+3)=67*90=6030 +67*3=201 \u21926030+201=6231.\n\nSo, 6240-6231=9.\n\nSo, 6240/67=93 +9/67.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 approaches 6240/67\u224893.134.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 6240/67, which is approximately93.134.\n\nBut wait, this contradicts the earlier parametrization approach where BD\u00b2 approaches480.\n\nI must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the parametrization approach where I considered \u03b8 approaching \u03c0/2, leading to S=120, but in reality, when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, point B approaches a fixed point with q\u00b2=600/11\u224854.545, which is much larger than the minimal q\u00b2=120/67\u22481.791.\n\nSo, the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 6240/67\u224893.134.\n\nBut wait, let me check the condition again.\n\nFrom the substitution approach, we have q\u00b2>120/67\u22481.791.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80 + (22*(120/67))/3=80 + (2640/67)/3=80 + 880/67= (80*67 +880)/67=(5360 +880)/67=6240/67\u224893.134.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 6240/67.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct by considering specific points.\n\nSuppose q\u00b2=120/67, which is the minimal q\u00b2.\n\nThen, from the hyperbola equation for B, p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24)=20(1 + (120/67)/24)=20(1 +5/(67*2))=20(1 +5/134)=20*(139/134)=2780/134=1390/67\u224820.746.\n\nSo, p\u00b2\u224820.746, q\u00b2\u22481.791.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4*(1390/67 +120/67)=4*(1510/67)=6040/67\u224890.149.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier calculation, it should be 6240/67\u224893.134.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake in the substitution approach.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nIf q\u00b2=120/67, then p\u00b2=20(1 + (120/67)/24)=20(1 + (5)/(67))=20*(72/67)=1440/67\u224821.492.\n\nThen, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1440/67 +120/67=1560/67\u224823.284.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(1560/67)=6240/67\u224893.134.\n\nAh, I see, earlier I mistakenly used p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24) as 20 +5 q\u00b2/6, which is correct, but when q\u00b2=120/67, p\u00b2=20 +5*(120/67)/6=20 + (600/67)/6=20 +100/67\u224820 +1.492\u224821.492.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=21.492 +1.791\u224823.283, and BD\u00b2=4*23.283\u224893.134.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 6240/67\u224893.134.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 6240/67, which is approximately93.134.\n\nBut let me confirm this with another approach.\n\nLet me consider that the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs when q\u00b2 is minimized, which is when q\u00b2=120/67.\n\nAt this point, p\u00b2=1440/67.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(1440/67 +120/67)=4*(1560/67)=6240/67\u224893.134.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 6240/67, which is approximately93.134.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 6240/67.\n\nBut let me check if this fraction can be simplified.\n\n6240 and 67: since 67 is a prime number, check if 67 divides 6240.\n\n67*93=6231, 6240-6231=9, so 6240=67*93 +9, so 6240 and 67 are coprime except for the remainder.\n\nThus, 6240/67 is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6240/67.\n\nBut let me compute 6240 \u00f767:\n\n67*93=6231, 6240-6231=9, so 6240/67=93 +9/67=93 9/67.\n\nSo, as a mixed number, it's 93 9/67, but as an improper fraction, it's6240/67.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is6240/67.\n\n\nThe greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{6240}{67}}\\).",
