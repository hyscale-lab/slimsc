      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since z is a complex number with magnitude 4, I can represent it as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might simplify things because working with exponentials could make it easier to handle both z and its reciprocal.\n\nSo, substituting z = 4e^{i\u03b8} into the expression, let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (75 + 117i)z. That would be (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8}. Let me calculate the magnitude of (75 + 117i) first because that might help. The magnitude is sqrt(75\u00b2 + 117\u00b2). Let me compute that: 75 squared is 5625, 117 squared is 13689. Adding them gives 5625 + 13689 = 19314. So the magnitude is sqrt(19314). Hmm, that's approximately sqrt(19314) \u2248 139. So, (75 + 117i) is a complex number with magnitude about 139, but exact value might not be necessary yet.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write (75 + 117i) as a complex number in polar form. Let me compute its magnitude and argument. The magnitude is sqrt(75\u00b2 + 117\u00b2) as I did before, which is sqrt(19314). Let's see if that simplifies. Let me factor 19314. Hmm, 19314 divided by 6 is 3219. 3219 divided by 3 is 1073. Hmm, 1073 is a prime number, I think. So, sqrt(19314) = sqrt(6 * 3 * 1073) = sqrt(18 * 1073) \u2248 139, as I thought.\n\nThe argument of (75 + 117i) is arctan(117/75). Let me compute that. 117/75 is 1.56. Arctan(1.56) is approximately 57 degrees, but in radians, that's roughly 1 radian. Hmm, not sure if I need the exact value, but maybe I can keep it symbolic for now.\n\nSo, (75 + 117i)z becomes (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8}. Hmm, perhaps it's better to express (75 + 117i) in polar form as r1 * e^{i\u03c61}, where r1 is sqrt(75\u00b2 + 117\u00b2) and \u03c61 is arctan(117/75). Then, multiplying by z = 4e^{i\u03b8} would give r1 * 4 * e^{i(\u03b8 + \u03c61)}.\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (96 + 144i)/z. Since z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. So, (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, now the entire expression becomes:\n\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = 4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nLet me write each term in polar form.\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\u03b8} = 4*r1 * e^{i(\u03b8 + \u03c61)}, where r1 is sqrt(75\u00b2 + 117\u00b2) = sqrt(19314). As I found earlier, r1 \u2248 139, but perhaps I can find an exact value or a simplified form. Wait, 75\u00b2 is 5625, 117\u00b2 is 13689. Adding them gives 19314. Hmm, 19314 divided by 3 is 6438, divided by 3 again is 2146. So, 19314 = 3 * 3 * 2146. Wait, 2146 is 2 * 1073. Hmm, and 1073 is a prime, I think. So, r1 = sqrt(19314) = 3*sqrt(2146), but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps 75 and 117 have a common factor. Let me check: 75 is 25*3, 117 is 39*3, so both are divisible by 3. So, 75 = 3*25, 117 = 3*39. So, (75 + 117i) = 3*(25 + 39i). Then, the magnitude is 3*sqrt(25\u00b2 + 39\u00b2) = 3*sqrt(625 + 1521) = 3*sqrt(2146). So, r1 = 3*sqrt(2146). So, 4*r1 = 4*3*sqrt(2146) = 12*sqrt(2146). Hmm, that's a bit more precise.\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}. Let me compute the magnitude of (24 + 36i). sqrt(24\u00b2 + 36\u00b2) = sqrt(576 + 1296) = sqrt(1872). 1872 = 16*117 = 16*9*13 = 144*13. So sqrt(1872) = 12*sqrt(13). So, the magnitude is 12*sqrt(13). The argument is arctan(36/24) = arctan(1.5) \u2248 56.3 degrees or about 0.9828 radians.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expression becomes:\n\n12*sqrt(2146) * e^{i(\u03b8 + \u03c61)} + 12*sqrt(13) * e^{-i(\u03b8 + \u03c62)}\n\nWait, let me see. The first term is 4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\u03b8} = 12*sqrt(2146) * e^{i(\u03b8 + \u03c61)}, where \u03c61 is arctan(117/75) = arctan(39/25) \u2248 56 degrees.\n\nThe second term is (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8} = 12*sqrt(13) * e^{-i(\u03b8 + \u03c62)}, where \u03c62 is arctan(36/24) = arctan(3/2) \u2248 56.3 degrees. Hmm, interesting, \u03c61 and \u03c62 are almost the same. Wait, let me compute them exactly.\n\nWait, (75 + 117i) is 3*(25 + 39i), so \u03c61 = arctan(39/25) \u2248 arctan(1.56) \u2248 57 degrees.\n\n(24 + 36i) is 12*(2 + 3i), so \u03c62 = arctan(3/2) \u2248 56.3 degrees. So, close but not exactly the same. So, perhaps it's better to treat them as separate angles.\n\nNow, the expression is a sum of two complex exponentials. To find the real part, I can expand each term.\n\nThe first term: 12*sqrt(2146) * e^{i(\u03b8 + \u03c61)} = 12*sqrt(2146) [cos(\u03b8 + \u03c61) + i sin(\u03b8 + \u03c61)].\n\nThe second term: 12*sqrt(13) * e^{-i(\u03b8 + \u03c62)} = 12*sqrt(13) [cos(\u03b8 + \u03c62) - i sin(\u03b8 + \u03c62)].\n\nSo, adding these together, the real part of the entire expression is:\n\n12*sqrt(2146) cos(\u03b8 + \u03c61) + 12*sqrt(13) cos(\u03b8 + \u03c62).\n\nThe imaginary parts would cancel out in some way, but since we're only interested in the real part, we can ignore the imaginary components.\n\nSo, the real part is:\n\n12*sqrt(2146) cos(\u03b8 + \u03c61) + 12*sqrt(13) cos(\u03b8 + \u03c62).\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out the 12, so:\n\n12 [ sqrt(2146) cos(\u03b8 + \u03c61) + sqrt(13) cos(\u03b8 + \u03c62) ].\n\nNow, I need to maximize this expression with respect to \u03b8. Since 12 is a positive constant, maximizing the expression inside the brackets will maximize the entire real part.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(2146), B = sqrt(13), \u03b1 = \u03c61, \u03b2 = \u03c62.\n\nSo, the expression becomes A cos(\u03b8 + \u03b1) + B cos(\u03b8 + \u03b2).\n\nTo find the maximum of this expression with respect to \u03b8, I can use some trigonometric identities or calculus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as C cos(\u03b8 + \u03b3), where C is the amplitude and \u03b3 is some phase shift. But since it's a sum of two cosines with different amplitudes and phases, it's not straightforward. Alternatively, I can take the derivative with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero to find the maximum.\n\nLet me proceed with calculus.\n\nLet f(\u03b8) = A cos(\u03b8 + \u03b1) + B cos(\u03b8 + \u03b2).\n\ndf/d\u03b8 = -A sin(\u03b8 + \u03b1) - B sin(\u03b8 + \u03b2).\n\nSet df/d\u03b8 = 0:\n\n-A sin(\u03b8 + \u03b1) - B sin(\u03b8 + \u03b2) = 0.\n\nWhich implies:\n\nA sin(\u03b8 + \u03b1) + B sin(\u03b8 + \u03b2) = 0.\n\nHmm, that's the equation to solve for \u03b8. But this seems tricky because \u03b8 appears in two sine terms with different phases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\nA sin(\u03b8 + \u03b1) = -B sin(\u03b8 + \u03b2).\n\nLet me write both sides using the sine addition formula.\n\nA [sin\u03b8 cos\u03b1 + cos\u03b8 sin\u03b1] = -B [sin\u03b8 cos\u03b2 + cos\u03b8 sin\u03b2].\n\nExpanding:\n\nA sin\u03b8 cos\u03b1 + A cos\u03b8 sin\u03b1 = -B sin\u03b8 cos\u03b2 - B cos\u03b8 sin\u03b2.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nA sin\u03b8 cos\u03b1 + A cos\u03b8 sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b8 cos\u03b2 + B cos\u03b8 sin\u03b2 = 0.\n\nFactor sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 (A cos\u03b1 + B cos\u03b2) + cos\u03b8 (A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2) = 0.\n\nHmm, that's an equation of the form P sin\u03b8 + Q cos\u03b8 = 0, where P = A cos\u03b1 + B cos\u03b2 and Q = A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2.\n\nSo, this equation can be rewritten as:\n\nP sin\u03b8 + Q cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\ntan\u03b8 = -Q/P.\n\nSo, \u03b8 = arctan(-Q/P) + n\u03c0, where n is integer.\n\nBut since \u03b8 is an angle, it's periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so we can consider \u03b8 = arctan(-Q/P) or \u03b8 = arctan(-Q/P) + \u03c0.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can compute P and Q numerically.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values of A, B, \u03b1, and \u03b2.\n\nFirst, compute A = sqrt(2146). Let's calculate that.\n\n2146 is between 46^2 = 2116 and 47^2=2209. 46^2=2116, 47^2=2209. So sqrt(2146) is approximately 46.32. Let me compute 46.32^2: 46^2=2116, 0.32^2\u22480.1024, 2*46*0.32\u224829.44. So total \u22482116 +29.44 +0.1024\u22482145.54, which is close to 2146. So, A\u224846.32.\n\nB = sqrt(13) \u22483.6055.\n\nNow, \u03b1 = arctan(39/25) \u2248 arctan(1.56) \u224857 degrees, which is about 1.0 radians (since 57 degrees \u22481 radian). Let me compute it more accurately. Using calculator: arctan(39/25) \u224856.99 degrees \u22481.0 radians. Let's take \u03b1\u22481.0 radians.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2= arctan(3/2)\u224856.31 degrees \u22480.9828 radians. Let's take \u03b2\u22480.9828 radians.\n\nSo now, compute P and Q.\n\nP = A cos\u03b1 + B cos\u03b2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nA cos\u03b1 \u224846.32 * cos(1.0) \u224846.32 * 0.5403 \u224825.05.\n\nB cos\u03b2 \u22483.6055 * cos(0.9828). Let's compute cos(0.9828). Since 0.9828 radians is about 56.3 degrees. cos(56.3 degrees)\u22480.5592. So, 3.6055 * 0.5592\u22482.025.\n\nSo, P \u224825.05 + 2.025 \u224827.075.\n\nSimilarly, Q = A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nA sin\u03b1 \u224846.32 * sin(1.0) \u224846.32 * 0.8415\u224839.03.\n\nB sin\u03b2 \u22483.6055 * sin(0.9828). sin(56.3 degrees)\u22480.8320. So, 3.6055 *0.8320\u22483.000.\n\nSo, Q\u224839.03 +3.000\u224842.03.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = -Q/P \u2248-42.03/27.075\u2248-1.552.\n\nThus, \u03b8 \u2248 arctan(-1.552). Let me compute that. arctan(-1.552) is in the fourth quadrant. The reference angle is arctan(1.552)\u224857 degrees, so \u03b8\u2248-57 degrees or 303 degrees, which is equivalent to 303*(\u03c0/180)\u22485.29 radians.\n\nBut since tan has a period of \u03c0, another solution is \u03b8\u2248-57 + 180 = 123 degrees, which is about 2.15 radians.\n\nSo, the critical points are at \u03b8\u22485.29 radians and \u03b8\u22482.15 radians.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the original function f(\u03b8) at these \u03b8 values to see which gives a maximum.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check both solutions because the maximum could be at either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute f(\u03b8) at \u03b8\u22482.15 radians and \u03b8\u22485.29 radians and see which is larger.\n\nAlternatively, since the function f(\u03b8) is periodic, perhaps the maximum occurs at \u03b8 where the derivative is zero, so I can just compute f(\u03b8) at \u03b8\u22482.15 and \u03b8\u22485.29.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute f(\u03b8) at \u03b8\u22482.15 and \u03b8\u22485.29.\n\nBut wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the maximum by considering the amplitude of the function f(\u03b8) = A cos(\u03b8 + \u03b1) + B cos(\u03b8 + \u03b2).\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as a single cosine function with some amplitude and phase shift.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nf(\u03b8) = A cos(\u03b8 + \u03b1) + B cos(\u03b8 + \u03b2).\n\nUsing the identity cos C + cos D = 2 cos[(C+D)/2] cos[(C-D)/2], but in this case, the coefficients A and B are different, so that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express f(\u03b8) as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03b3), where R is the amplitude and \u03b3 is the phase shift. But I'm not sure if that's possible because A and B are different. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider f(\u03b8) as a sum of two sinusoids with the same frequency but different amplitudes and phases.\n\nWait, another approach is to write f(\u03b8) as:\n\nf(\u03b8) = A cos(\u03b8 + \u03b1) + B cos(\u03b8 + \u03b2) = [A cos\u03b1 + B cos\u03b2] cos\u03b8 - [A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2] sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, wait, let me verify that. Let me expand each term:\n\nA cos(\u03b8 + \u03b1) = A cos\u03b8 cos\u03b1 - A sin\u03b8 sin\u03b1.\n\nB cos(\u03b8 + \u03b2) = B cos\u03b8 cos\u03b2 - B sin\u03b8 sin\u03b2.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(A cos\u03b1 + B cos\u03b2) cos\u03b8 - (A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2) sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) = P cos\u03b8 + Q sin\u03b8, where P = A cos\u03b1 + B cos\u03b2, and Q = - (A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2).\n\nWait, earlier I had P = A cos\u03b1 + B cos\u03b2 and Q = A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2, but here, it's P cos\u03b8 + Q sin\u03b8, where Q is negative of that.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) = P cos\u03b8 + Q sin\u03b8, with Q = - (A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2).\n\nHmm, but I can express P cos\u03b8 + Q sin\u03b8 as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R = sqrt(P\u00b2 + Q\u00b2) and tan\u03b4 = Q/P.\n\nWait, but wait, in this case, Q is negative of what I had before. Let me compute R.\n\nR = sqrt(P\u00b2 + Q\u00b2) = sqrt(P\u00b2 + (A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2)^2).\n\nWait, but P = A cos\u03b1 + B cos\u03b2, and Q = -(A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2). So, Q\u00b2 = (A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2)^2.\n\nSo, R = sqrt( (A cos\u03b1 + B cos\u03b2)^2 + (A sin\u03b1 + B sin\u03b2)^2 ).\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= sqrt( A\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b1 + 2AB cos\u03b1 cos\u03b2 + B\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b2 + A\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b1 + 2AB sin\u03b1 sin\u03b2 + B\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b2 )\n\n= sqrt( A\u00b2 (cos\u00b2\u03b1 + sin\u00b2\u03b1) + B\u00b2 (cos\u00b2\u03b2 + sin\u00b2\u03b2) + 2AB (cos\u03b1 cos\u03b2 + sin\u03b1 sin\u03b2) )\n\n= sqrt( A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + 2AB cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2) )\n\nBecause cos\u03b1 cos\u03b2 + sin\u03b1 sin\u03b2 = cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2).\n\nSo, R = sqrt( A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + 2AB cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2) )\n\nHmm, interesting. So, the maximum value of f(\u03b8) is R, since the maximum of R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4) is R.\n\nWait, but wait. Because f(\u03b8) = R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), the maximum value of f(\u03b8) is R, and the minimum is -R.\n\nSo, the maximum real part would be R.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because when I expressed f(\u03b8) as P cos\u03b8 + Q sin\u03b8, which can be written as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R is sqrt(P\u00b2 + Q\u00b2), and \u03b4 is the phase shift.\n\nWait, but in this case, f(\u03b8) = P cos\u03b8 + Q sin\u03b8, which can be rewritten as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R = sqrt(P\u00b2 + Q\u00b2), and tan\u03b4 = Q/P.\n\nBut since Q is negative, \u03b4 will be in a different quadrant.\n\nWait, but regardless, the maximum value of f(\u03b8) is R, so the maximum real part is R.\n\nSo, R = sqrt( A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + 2AB cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2) )\n\nGiven that A = sqrt(2146), B = sqrt(13), \u03b1 = arctan(39/25), \u03b2 = arctan(3/2).\n\nWait, let's compute \u03b1 - \u03b2. Since \u03b1 \u22481.0 radians, \u03b2\u22480.9828 radians. So, \u03b1 - \u03b2 \u22480.0172 radians, which is about 1 degree.\n\nSo, cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2) \u2248cos(0.0172) \u22480.99985.\n\nSo, R \u2248sqrt( (sqrt(2146))\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(2146)*sqrt(13)*0.99985 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\nA\u00b2 = 2146\n\nB\u00b2 = 13\n\n2AB cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2) \u22482*sqrt(2146)*sqrt(13)*0.99985 \u22482*sqrt(2146*13)*0.99985.\n\nCompute 2146*13: 2146*10=21460, 2146*3=6438, total=21460+6438=27898.\n\nSo sqrt(27898) \u2248167 (since 167^2=27889, which is very close). So, sqrt(27898)\u2248167.0.\n\nThus, 2AB cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2) \u22482*167.0*0.99985\u22482*167\u2248334.\n\nWait, but 2*167 is 334, and 0.99985 is almost 1, so approximately 334.\n\nSo, R \u2248sqrt(2146 +13 +334) = sqrt(2146+13=2159; 2159+334=2493). So, sqrt(2493)\u224849.93\u224850.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, R is approximately 50.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 12*R \u224812*50=600.\n\nWait, but wait. Because in our earlier step, f(\u03b8) was equal to [A cos(\u03b8 + \u03b1) + B cos(\u03b8 + \u03b2)] which we expressed as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4). Then, the real part of the original expression is 12*f(\u03b8), so the maximum real part would be 12*R, which is 12*50=600.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because I approximated R as 50, but maybe I can compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + 2AB cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2):\n\nA\u00b2 = 2146\n\nB\u00b2 =13\n\n2AB cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2) \u22482*sqrt(2146)*sqrt(13)*cos(0.0172) \u22482*sqrt(2146*13)*0.99985.\n\nAs before, 2146*13=27898, sqrt(27898)=167.0 approximately. So, 2*167.0*0.99985\u2248334.\n\nSo, total is 2146 +13 +334 =2493.\n\nsqrt(2493) \u224849.93, so R\u224849.93.\n\nThus, the maximum real part is 12*49.93\u2248599.16, which is approximately 599.16.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can compute more accurately.\n\nWait, sqrt(2493) is exactly sqrt(2493). Let me compute sqrt(2493):\n\n49^2=2401, 50^2=2500. So, sqrt(2493)=50 - (7/98)\u224849.92857.\n\nWait, wait, wait. 50^2=2500, so 2500 -7=2493. So, 50^2 -7=2493. So, sqrt(2493) = sqrt(50^2 -7) \u224850 - (7)/(2*50) )=50 - 0.07=49.93. So, R\u224849.93.\n\nThus, 12*R\u224812*49.93\u2248599.16.\n\nSo, approximately 599.16. But perhaps the exact value is 600, given the approximations.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, when I expressed f(\u03b8) as R cos(theta - delta), I think that's correct, but I need to make sure that R is indeed the amplitude of the function.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can consider the original expression as (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z|=4.\n\nLet me write z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n(75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/4 e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nLet me write each complex number in polar form.\n\nCompute the magnitudes:\n\n|75 + 117i| = sqrt(75\u00b2 + 117\u00b2) = sqrt(5625 + 13689) = sqrt(19314) \u2248139. So, 4*139 \u2248556.\n\n|24 + 36i| = sqrt(24\u00b2 +36\u00b2) = sqrt(576 +1296)=sqrt(1872)=12*sqrt(13)\u224846.67.\n\nSo, the expression is 556 e^{i(theta + phi1)} + 46.67 e^{-i(theta + phi2)}, where phi1 is the argument of (75+117i) and phi2 is the argument of (24+36i).\n\nHmm, this seems similar to the earlier approach.\n\nBut perhaps another way is to set w = e^{i theta}, so that the expression becomes:\n\n4*(75 + 117i) w + (24 + 36i)/w.\n\nSo, the expression is 4*(75 + 117i) w + (24 + 36i)/w.\n\nLet me denote A = 4*(75 + 117i), B = 24 + 36i.\n\nSo, the expression is A w + B/w.\n\nTo find the real part of this expression, I can write it as Re(A w + B/w).\n\nSince w = e^{i theta}, 1/w = e^{-i theta}.\n\nSo, Re(A w + B/w) = Re(A w) + Re(B/w) = Re(A w) + Re(B e^{-i theta}).\n\nBut A is a complex number, as is B.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write A and B in polar form.\n\nLet me compute A = 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.\n\nThe magnitude of A is sqrt(300\u00b2 +468\u00b2) = sqrt(90000 + 219024)=sqrt(309024)=556.\n\nThe argument phi_A = arctan(468/300)=arctan(1.56)=approximately 57 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, B=24+36i, magnitude is sqrt(24\u00b2+36\u00b2)=sqrt(576+1296)=sqrt(1872)=12*sqrt(13)=approximately 46.67.\n\nArgument phi_B=arctan(36/24)=arctan(1.5)=approximately 56.3 degrees.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n556 e^{i(theta + phi_A)} + 46.67 e^{-i(theta + phi_B)}.\n\nNow, the real part is 556 cos(theta + phi_A) +46.67 cos(theta + phi_B).\n\nHmm, so to maximize this, I can treat it as a function of theta: f(theta)=556 cos(theta + alpha) +46.67 cos(theta + beta), where alpha=phi_A\u224857 degrees, beta=phi_B\u224856.3 degrees.\n\nWait, this is similar to the earlier approach.\n\nSo, to find the maximum of f(theta), perhaps I can consider it as a sum of two cosines with slightly different phases.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the maximum when both cosines are aligned, i.e., when theta + alpha = 0 and theta + beta=0, but that's not possible unless alpha=beta, which they are not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of expressing the sum as a single cosine function with some amplitude.\n\nWait, I can use the formula for the sum of two cosines:\n\ncos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2].\n\nBut in this case, the coefficients are different: 556 and 46.67. So, perhaps I can factor out the smaller term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write f(theta) as 556 cos(theta + alpha) +46.67 cos(theta + beta) = K [ (556/K) cos(theta + alpha) + (46.67/K) cos(theta + beta) ].\n\nLet me choose K such that (556/K) = (46.67/K) = some common value. But that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as a sum of two sinusoids and find the maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider the expression as:\n\nf(theta) = C cos(theta) + D sin(theta) + E cos(theta) + F sin(theta),\n\nWait, no, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use calculus to find the maximum.\n\nWait, let's go back to the expression f(theta) =556 cos(theta + alpha) +46.67 cos(theta + beta).\n\nCompute the derivative f\u2019(theta):\n\nf\u2019(theta) = -556 sin(theta + alpha) -46.67 sin(theta + beta).\n\nSet f\u2019(theta)=0:\n\n556 sin(theta + alpha) +46.67 sin(theta + beta) =0.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n556 sin(theta + alpha) = -46.67 sin(theta + beta).\n\nDivide both sides by 46.67:\n\n(556 /46.67) sin(theta + alpha) = - sin(theta + beta).\n\n556 /46.67 \u224812.\n\nSo, approximately, 12 sin(theta + alpha) = - sin(theta + beta).\n\nHmm, that's a transcendental equation and might not have a closed-form solution, so perhaps I can solve it numerically.\n\nLet me denote gamma = theta.\n\nSo, 12 sin(gamma + alpha) + sin(gamma + beta) =0.\n\nLet me plug in alpha\u224857 degrees, beta\u224856.3 degrees, so in radians, alpha\u22481.0 radians, beta\u22480.9828 radians.\n\nSo, 12 sin(gamma +1.0) + sin(gamma +0.9828)=0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n12 sin(gamma +1.0) = - sin(gamma +0.9828).\n\nLet me denote gamma +1.0 = x, so gamma =x -1.0.\n\nThen, gamma +0.9828 = x -1.0 +0.9828 =x -0.0172.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n12 sin x = - sin(x - 0.0172).\n\nUsing the sine subtraction formula:\n\nsin(x -0.0172)=sin x cos(0.0172) - cos x sin(0.0172).\n\nApproximately, since 0.0172 radians is very small, cos(0.0172)\u22481, sin(0.0172)\u22480.0172.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n12 sin x \u2248 - [ sin x *1 - cos x *0.0172 ].\n\nSo,\n\n12 sin x \u2248 - sin x + 0.0172 cos x.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n12 sin x + sin x -0.0172 cos x \u22480.\n\n13 sin x -0.0172 cos x \u22480.\n\nDivide both sides by cos x:\n\n13 tan x -0.0172 \u22480.\n\nSo,\n\ntan x \u22480.0172 /13 \u22480.001323.\n\nThus, x \u2248 arctan(0.001323) \u22480.001323 radians.\n\nSo, x \u22480.001323 radians.\n\nTherefore, gamma =x -1.0 \u22480.001323 -1.0\u2248-0.998677 radians.\n\nBut angles are periodic, so adding 2\u03c0 gives gamma \u22485.284 radians.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another solution where tan x is negative, but let's check.\n\nWait, in the approximation, I neglected higher-order terms in the sine and cosine expansions, but perhaps the solution is near x\u22480, leading to gamma\u2248-1.0 radians.\n\nWait, let's compute f(theta) at theta\u2248-1.0 radians and theta\u22485.284 radians.\n\nFirst, theta\u2248-1.0 radians.\n\nCompute f(theta)=556 cos(theta + alpha) +46.67 cos(theta + beta).\n\nWith alpha\u22481.0, beta\u22480.9828.\n\ntheta + alpha \u2248-1.0 +1.0=0 radians.\n\ntheta + beta\u2248-1.0 +0.9828\u2248-0.0172 radians.\n\nSo, f(theta)=556 cos(0) +46.67 cos(-0.0172)\u2248556*1 +46.67*0.99985\u2248556 +46.66\u2248602.66.\n\nHmm, that's a high value.\n\nAlternatively, theta\u22485.284 radians.\n\nCompute theta + alpha\u22485.284 +1.0\u22486.284 radians\u22482\u03c0 radians (since 2\u03c0\u22486.2832). So, cos(6.284)\u2248cos(2\u03c0)=1.\n\nTheta + beta\u22485.284 +0.9828\u22486.2668 radians\u22482\u03c0 -0.0164 radians. So, cos(theta + beta)\u2248cos(2\u03c0 -0.0164)=cos(0.0164)\u22480.999868.\n\nSo, f(theta)=556*1 +46.67*0.999868\u2248556 +46.66\u2248602.66.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm, so the maximum real part is approximately 602.66.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed R\u224849.93, leading to 12*R\u2248599.16, which is a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps my earlier approach had a mistake.\n\nWait, let's re-express f(theta) correctly.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I expressed the real part as 12 [A cos(theta + alpha) + B cos(theta + beta)].\n\nBut in the second approach, I considered the entire expression as 4*(75+117i) e^{i theta} + (24 +36i)/e^{i theta}.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the first approach regarding the coefficients.\n\nWait, let's re-express the original problem.\n\nOriginal expression: (75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z, where |z|=4.\n\nLet me write z=4e^{i theta}, so 1/z= (1/4)e^{-i theta}.\n\nSo, expression becomes:\n\n(75 +117i)*4 e^{i theta} + (96 +144i)*(1/4) e^{-i theta}.\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\n(75 +117i)*4 = 300 + 468i.\n\n(96 +144i)/4 =24 +36i.\n\nSo, expression is (300 +468i)e^{i theta} + (24 +36i)e^{-i theta}.\n\nSo, the real part is Re[(300 +468i)e^{i theta} + (24 +36i)e^{-i theta}].\n\nCompute each term:\n\nRe[(300 +468i)e^{i theta}] = Re[300 e^{i theta} +468i e^{i theta}].\n\n= Re[300 (cos theta +i sin theta) +468i (cos theta +i sin theta)].\n\n= Re[300 cos theta +300i sin theta +468i cos theta -468 sin theta].\n\n= (300 cos theta -468 sin theta).\n\nSimilarly, Re[(24 +36i)e^{-i theta}] = Re[24 e^{-i theta} +36i e^{-i theta}].\n\n= Re[24 (cos theta -i sin theta) +36i (cos theta -i sin theta)].\n\n= Re[24 cos theta -24i sin theta +36i cos theta -36 sin theta].\n\n= (24 cos theta -36 sin theta).\n\nSo, the total real part is:\n\n(300 cos theta -468 sin theta) + (24 cos theta -36 sin theta) = (300 +24) cos theta + (-468 -36) sin theta.\n\n= 324 cos theta -504 sin theta.\n\nSo, the real part is 324 cos theta -504 sin theta.\n\nAh, this is a much simpler expression! So, the real part is 324 cos theta -504 sin theta.\n\nNow, to find the maximum value of this expression, we can write it as R cos(theta + phi), where R is the amplitude.\n\nCompute R = sqrt(324^2 +504^2).\n\n324^2 = 104,976.\n\n504^2 = 254,016.\n\nSum: 104,976 +254,016 =359,  976 + 254,016 = 359,  976+254,016: Let me compute 104,976 +254,016:\n\n104,976 +254,016 = 358,992.\n\nSo, R = sqrt(358,992).\n\nCompute sqrt(358,992):\n\nWell, 600^2=360,000, which is 1008 more than 358,992.\n\nSo, 600^2 =360,000.\n\n358,992 =600^2 - 1008.\n\nSo, sqrt(358,992)= approximately 600 - (1008)/(2*600)=600 - 1008/1200=600 - 0.84=599.16.\n\nSo, R\u2248599.16.\n\nThus, the maximum real part is R, which is approximately 599.16.\n\nSince the problem asks for the largest possible real part, the answer is approximately 599.16, which is approximately 599.16. But let me check the exact value.\n\nWait, sqrt(358992)=sqrt(358992). Let me factor this.\n\n358992 \u00f7 16 = 22437.\n\n22437 \u00f7 3=7479.\n\n7479 \u00f73=2493.\n\n2493 \u00f73=831.\n\n831 \u00f73=277.\n\nWait, 277 is a prime number.\n\nSo, 358992=16 *3^3 *277.\n\nHmm, so sqrt(358992)=4*3^(3/2)*sqrt(277).\n\nBut that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to leave it as sqrt(324^2 +504^2)=sqrt(358992).\n\nBut since 358992= (600 - 0.84)^2\u2248600^2 - 2*600*0.84 +0.84^2=360000 -1008 +0.7056\u2248358992.7056, which is close to 358992, so sqrt(358992)\u2248599.16.\n\nThus, the maximum real part is approximately 599.16.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the exact value is 600, but our calculation shows it's approximately 599.16.\n\nWait, but let's compute sqrt(358992) accurately.\n\nCompute 599^2=358,801.\n\n600^2=360,000.\n\n358,992 is between 599^2 and 600^2.\n\nCompute 599.16^2: (599 +0.16)^2=599^2 +2*599*0.16 +0.16^2=358,801 +191.68 +0.0256\u2248358,801 +191.68=358,992.68 +0.0256\u2248358,992.7056.\n\nWhich is very close to 358,992, so sqrt(358,992)= approximately 599.16.\n\nThus, the maximum real part is approximately 599.16.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the largest possible real part, and our calculation gives approximately 599.16, which is approximately 599.16. But perhaps the exact value is 600, but I think it's more precise to say approximately 599.16.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me compute 324^2 and 504^2 again.\n\n324^2: 300^2=90,000; 24^2=576; 2*300*24=14,400. So, 90,000 +14,400 +576=104,976.\n\n504^2: 500^2=250,000; 4^2=16; 2*500*4=4,000. So, 250,000 +4,000 +16=254,016.\n\nSum: 104,976 +254,016=359,  104,976+254,016=358,992.\n\nSo, sqrt(358,992)= approximately 599.16.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is approximately 599.16.\n\nThus, the largest possible real part is approximately 599.16, which is about 599.16.\n\nBut perhaps the exact value is 600, but given the calculation, it's approximately 599.16.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can express it exactly.\n\nWait, 324 and 504 have a common factor. Let me see:\n\n324= 4*81=4*9^2.\n\n504= 8*63=8*9*7.\n\nSo, 324=4*9^2, 504=8*9*7.\n\nSo, 324= 4*9^2, 504=8*9*7.\n\nSo, 324= 4*9^2, 504=8*9*7.\n\nSo, sqrt(324^2 +504^2)=sqrt( (4*9^2)^2 + (8*9*7)^2 )=sqrt(16*9^4 +64*9^2*49).\n\nFactor out 16*9^2:\n\n= sqrt(16*9^2 [9^2 + 4*49]).\n\n=4*9*sqrt(81 + 196).\n\n=36*sqrt(277).\n\nWait, 277 is a prime number.\n\nSo, sqrt(324^2 +504^2)=36*sqrt(277).\n\nCompute 36*sqrt(277):\n\nsqrt(277)\u224816.6433.\n\nSo, 36*16.6433\u2248599.16.\n\nSo, the exact maximum real part is 36*sqrt(277), which is approximately 599.16.\n\nThus, the answer is 36*sqrt(277), which is approximately 599.16.\n\nBut let me compute 36*sqrt(277) more accurately.\n\nsqrt(277)=16.643319.\n\n36*16.643319\u224836*16=576, 36*0.643319\u224823.16, total\u2248576+23.16=599.16.\n\nSo, the exact maximum real part is 36\u221a277, which is approximately 599.16.\n\nThus, the largest possible real part is 36\u221a277, which is approximately 599.16.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to put the final answer in a box. So, perhaps we can write it as 36\u221a277, which is exact.\n\nAlternatively, if they want a numerical value, it's approximately 599.16, but perhaps we can write it as 36\u221a277.\n\nWait, let me check 36\u221a277.\n\n36^2=1296.\n\n277*1296= 277*(1300-4)=277*1300=360,100; 277*(-4)=-1,108. So, 360,100-1,108=358,992. Which matches our earlier sum.\n\nSo, yes, 36\u221a277 squared is 36^2*277=1296*277=358,992, which matches the sum of squares. So, that's correct.\n\nThus, the exact maximum real part is 36\u221a277, which is approximately 599.16.\n\nSo, the answer is 36\u221a277, which is the exact value.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\] where \\(|z| = 4\\), we express \\(z\\) as \\(4e^{i\\theta}\\). Substituting \\(z\\) and simplifying, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nThe real part of this expression is:\n\n\\[\n324\\cos\\theta - 504\\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as \\(R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi)\\), where \\(R = \\sqrt{324^2 + 504^2} = 36\\sqrt{277}\\). The maximum value of the real part is \\(R\\), which is approximately 599.16.\n\nThus, the largest possible real part is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36\\sqrt{277}}\n\\]",
