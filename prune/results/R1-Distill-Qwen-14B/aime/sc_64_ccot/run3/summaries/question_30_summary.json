      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1, and all the powers from \u03c9^0 up to \u03c9^12 are distinct and are the roots of the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x), which is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.\n\nThe product given is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that out:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI need to compute this product and then find P mod 1000.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this expression inside the product. Let's see: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me rearrange it:\n\n= \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2\n\nHmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo, the product P becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) where x = \u03c9^k.\n\nBut wait, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, the x's are all the 13th roots of unity except x=1? Wait, no. Because when k=0, \u03c9^0 =1, so x=1 is included. So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity x, of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nSo, P = \u220f_{x: x\u00b9\u00b3=1} (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2)\n\nHmm, I think that's a key insight. So, the product is over all x such that x\u00b9\u00b3=1. So, that's the same as evaluating the product over all roots x of x\u00b9\u00b3 -1=0 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nI remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots \u03b1 of f(x) of (x - \u03b1) is just f(x). But here, the product is over (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at each root x of x\u00b9\u00b3 -1=0. So, perhaps I can think of it as the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nAlternatively, I might consider that the product over all x where x\u00b9\u00b3=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the resultant of x\u00b9\u00b3 -1 and x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, but I'm not sure about that approach.\n\nWait, maybe another way: if I have a polynomial f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, and I evaluate the product of f(x) for each x that is a root of x\u00b9\u00b3 -1=0. So, the product is the product of f(x) over all roots x of x\u00b9\u00b3 -1.\n\nI think this is related to the concept of cyclotomic polynomials. The product of f(x) over all roots of x^n - 1 is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n -1, but I'm not entirely sure how that works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms to turn the product into a sum. Wait, but that might complicate things since we're dealing with complex numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x +2) is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and x\u00b2 - 2x +2. The resultant of two polynomials f and g is the product of f evaluated at the roots of g, or something like that. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition, but I think it's the product of f(\u03b1) for each root \u03b1 of g. So, if f is x^13 -1, and g is x\u00b2 - 2x +2, then the resultant would be the product of (\u03b1^13 -1) for each root \u03b1 of g.\n\nWait, but in this case, I need the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x +2) evaluated at each root of x^13 -1=0. So, perhaps it's the resultant of x^13 -1 and x\u00b2 - 2x +2, which is the product over all roots x of x^13 -1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x +2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the product over all roots of a polynomial f(x) of another polynomial g(x). I think that's equal to the resultant of f and g, which can also be expressed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix. But I'm not sure if computing that determinant is feasible here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over all x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the value of the resultant Res(x^13 -1, x\u00b2 - 2x +2). Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, another approach: if I have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 -1, and I want the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x +2) evaluated at each root x of f(x). So, this is the same as the product of f(\u03b1) evaluated at the roots \u03b1 of x\u00b2 -2x +2. Wait, no, that's the other way around. Wait, no, perhaps I can think of it as follows.\n\nIf f(x) = x^13 -1, which factors as (x -1)\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x), where \u03a6\u2081\u2083 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. Then, the product over x of (x\u00b2 -2x +2) would be the product over all roots x of f(x) of (x\u00b2 -2x +2). So, that's the same as the product over x of (x\u00b2 -2x +2) where x runs through the 13th roots of unity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as the value of the resultant of f(x) and g(x) where g(x)=x\u00b2-2x+2.\n\nWait, the resultant Res(f, g) is equal to the product of f(\u03b1) for each root \u03b1 of g. But here, I'm looking for the product of g(x) for each root x of f. Hmm, so perhaps it's Res(g, f)? Or maybe not exactly. I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the product over all x where x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x +2). Let me denote this product as P. Then, perhaps I can relate P to the value of another polynomial evaluated at specific points.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider the polynomial h(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2. Let's factor h(x). The roots of h(x) can be found using the quadratic formula: x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, h(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, h(x) factors into linear terms as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Now, perhaps I can relate the product P to h evaluated at all the 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, maybe using the property that the product over x of (x - a) for x being the roots of x^n -1 is equal to the resultant of x^n -1 and (x - a). Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over x of (x - a) is equal to the value of the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at a, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, more precisely, for a given a, the product over x of (x - a) where x runs over all n-th roots of unity is equal to the resultant of x^n -1 and (x - a). But perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the product P as the product over x of h(x) where x runs over the 13th roots of unity. So, P = \u220f_{x^13=1} h(x).\n\nNow, I recall that for a polynomial f(x), the product of f(x) over all x^m=1 is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^m -1, which can also be expressed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix. But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use logarithms and turn the product into a sum. But that might not be helpful because we're dealing with complex numbers, and taking the logarithm of a product would involve summing the logs, which could complicate things.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that the product P is equal to the value of the resultant of the polynomials f(x) = x^13 -1 and g(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2. The resultant Res(f, g) is equal to the product of g(x) evaluated at each root x of f(x). So, that would indeed give me exactly the product P that I'm trying to compute. So, P = Res(f, g) where f(x) = x^13 -1 and g(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2.\n\nNow, the resultant of two polynomials f and g can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, which is a matrix formed from the coefficients of f and g. However, computing a 15x15 determinant might be tedious, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the resultant in terms of the roots of the polynomials. The resultant Res(f, g) is equal to the product of f evaluated at each root of g, each raised to the multiplicity of that root in g. Since g is quadratic, it has two roots, 1+i and 1-i, each with multiplicity 1. So, Res(f, g) = f(1+i) * f(1-i).\n\nWait, that's a much simpler approach! So, if I can compute f(1+i) and f(1-i), then their product would give me the resultant, which is equal to P.\n\nSo, let me compute f(1+i) and f(1-i).\n\nf(x) = x^13 -1.\n\nSo, f(1+i) = (1+i)^13 -1.\n\nSimilarly, f(1-i) = (1-i)^13 -1.\n\nSo, P = [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ]\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1+i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1+i is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1+i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and 1-i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nThus, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet's compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} can be simplified. 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. But wait, 13\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) gives 5\u03c0/4, which is the same as -3\u03c0/4. Alternatively, since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so e^{i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*2)} = e^{i*(13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4)} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute e^{i*5\u03c0/4} and e^{-i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\n5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, so cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) / 2 * (-1) = 64*(2)/2*(-1) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)*i = -64i.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me compute each term correctly.\n\nWait, 64*sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is 64 * (sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)).\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 64 * (2 * (-1/2)) )= 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)*i. Same calculation: 64*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2)*(-i) = 64*(2/2)*(-i) = 64*(-i) = -64i.\n\nWait, but wait, the expression is 64*sqrt(2) multiplied by [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nSo, let's compute each component:\n\nReal part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) )= 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * i = 64 * (-2/2) * i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i*5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nComputing this:\n\nReal part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) * i = 64 * (2/2) * i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1-i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nNow, f(1+i) = (1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, f(1-i) = (1-i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, P = [ -65 -64i ] * [ -65 +64i ].\n\nThis is a product of complex conjugates, so it equals (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225.\n\n(64i)^2 = 64^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, P = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, 4225 + 4096: Let's compute 4225 + 4096. 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96 = 321. So total is 8321.\n\nSo, P = 8321.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because 8321 is less than 10000, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, (1+i)^13: Did I compute that correctly?\n\nWait, 1+i in polar form is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nRaising to the 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\ne^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * e^{i 3\u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * (-1), since e^{i 3\u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0} = -1.\n\nWait, wait, 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with 2\u03c0, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0.\n\nBut 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 (mod 2\u03c0), because 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0. So, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i (\u03c0/4 + \u03c0)} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * e^{i \u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * (-1) = -e^{i \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i (\u03c0/4 + \u03c0)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * e^{-i \u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * (-1) = -e^{-i \u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, so let me correct that.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * (-e^{i \u03c0/4}).\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * (-e^{-i \u03c0/4}).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-e^{i \u03c0/4}) = -64*sqrt(2) * e^{i \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = -64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i \u03c0/4} is (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2), and e^{-i \u03c0/4} is (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -64*sqrt(2) * [sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i)].\n\nCompute sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = (2)/2 = 1.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 * (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = -64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = -64*sqrt(2) * [sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i)].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = 1, so this becomes -64*(1 - i).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64*(1+i) = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = -64*(1 -i) = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, f(1+i) = (1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, f(1-i) = (1-i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThus, P = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, that's the same as before, so P=8321.\n\nBut wait, I thought earlier that P was the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which I then converted into the product over all 13th roots of unity x of (x\u00b2 -2x +2), which is equal to Res(x^13 -1, x\u00b2 -2x +2) = f(1+i)*f(1-i) = 8321.\n\nSo, P=8321.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the remainder when P is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this computation.\n\nCompute 8321 \u00f7 1000: 1000 *8=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, yes, 8321 mod1000=321.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit concerned because I thought the resultant approach might not be the correct one, but it seems to have worked out.\n\nWait, but another way to check: maybe I can compute the product numerically for some small n and see if it matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing (1+i)^13.\n\nWait, earlier, I computed (1+i)^13 as -64*(1+i), which gave me -64 -64i. But let me verify that.\n\nWe have (1+i) = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\ne^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * e^{i 3\u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = -e^{i \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-e^{i \u03c0/4}).\n\nBut e^{i \u03c0/4} is (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, 64*sqrt(2) * (-e^{i \u03c0/4}) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nCompute 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) )= 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 i )= 64*(-2/2 i )= -64i.\n\nSo, indeed, (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSo, f(1+i) = (1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, f(1-i) = (1-i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, P=8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit concerned because 8321 seems like a big number, and I'm not sure if I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: since the product is over all 13th roots of unity, perhaps I can consider that the product of (x\u00b2 -2x +2) over all x^13=1 is equal to the value of the resultant Res(x^13 -1, x\u00b2 -2x +2). But I used that approach and got 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the product by recognizing that the product over all x of (x\u00b2 -2x +2) is the same as the product over all x of (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). So, the product is \u220f_{x^13=1} (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).\n\nWhich is equal to \u220f_{x^13=1} (x - (1+i)) * \u220f_{x^13=1} (x - (1-i)).\n\nEach of these products is the value of the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at (1+i) and (1-i), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the product over all x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and (x -a), which is a^13 -1. Wait, that's because the resultant of x^13 -1 and (x -a) is the product of (a - x) for each root x of x^13 -1, which is (-1)^13 times the product over x of (x -a). But since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. So, \u220f_{x^13=1} (x -a) = (-1)^13 * (a^13 -1) = -(a^13 -1).\n\nWait, so \u220f_{x^13=1} (x -a) = -(a^13 -1).\n\nSo, in our case, \u220f_{x^13=1} (x - (1+i)) = -( (1+i)^13 -1 ).\n\nSimilarly, \u220f_{x^13=1} (x - (1-i)) = -( (1-i)^13 -1 ).\n\nSo, the product P is equal to [ -( (1+i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ -( (1-i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\nWhich is equal to [ -f(1+i) ] * [ -f(1-i) ] = (-1)^2 * f(1+i)*f(1-i) = f(1+i)*f(1-i).\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier, giving P=8321.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, P=8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let me compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13 again.\n\nWe can compute (1+i)^2 = 2i, so (1+i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1+i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1+i)^13 = (1+i)^8 * (1+i)^4 * (1+i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1+i) = -64*(1+i) = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^2 = -2i, so (1-i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1-i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1-i)^13 = (1-i)^8 * (1-i)^4 * (1-i)^1 = 16*(-4)*(1-i) = -64*(1-i) = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, f(1+i) = (1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nf(1-i) = (1-i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, P=8321, and 8321 mod1000 is 321.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that the product involves all 13th roots of unity, denoted by \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12. The expression inside the product can be rewritten as a quadratic in \u03c9^k: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2. \n\nThis allows us to express the product as:\n\n\\[ P = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2) \\]\n\nThe product is over all 13th roots of unity x. We can compute this by evaluating the resultant of the polynomials x^13 - 1 and x^2 - 2x + 2. The resultant is the product of x^2 - 2x + 2 evaluated at the roots of x^13 - 1, which are the 13th roots of unity.\n\nThe roots of x^2 - 2x + 2 are 1 \u00b1 i. Using the property of resultants, the product becomes:\n\n\\[ P = f(1+i) \\cdot f(1-i) \\]\n\nwhere \\( f(x) = x^{13} - 1 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( f(1+i) \\) and \\( f(1-i) \\):\n\n1. Express 1 \u00b1 i in polar form: \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\pi/4} \\) and \\( 1 - i = \\sqrt{2}e^{-i\\pi/4} \\).\n2. Raise to the 13th power: \\( (1+i)^{13} = -64(1+i) \\) and \\( (1-i)^{13} = -64(1-i) \\).\n3. Subtract 1: \\( f(1+i) = -65 - 64i \\) and \\( f(1-i) = -65 + 64i \\).\n4. Multiply: \\( P = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = 8321 \\).\n\nFinally, find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[ 8321 \\mod 1000 = 321 \\]\n\n**Answer:** 321",
