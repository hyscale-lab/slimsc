      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Oh wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y) because the origin is the midpoint. Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use vectors here. Let me consider the coordinates of the points. Let me denote A as (a, b), so C is (-a, -b). Similarly, B is (c, d), so D is (-c, -d).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude. Let me compute vectors AB and AD.\n\nVector AB is (c - a, d - b).\nVector AD is (-c - a, -d - b).\n\nThe lengths squared of these vectors should be equal.\n\nSo, (c - a)\u00b2 + (d - b)\u00b2 = (-c - a)\u00b2 + (-d - b)\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2) = c\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ac - 2bd.\n\nRight side: ((-c - a)\u00b2) is (c + a)\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2, similarly for d: (-d - b)\u00b2 = (d + b)\u00b2 = d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, right side becomes c\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSet left = right:\n\nc\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ac - 2bd = c\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSubtracting the common terms from both sides:\n\n-2ac - 2bd = 2ac + 2bd.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-4ac -4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, we have ac + bd = 0. That's one condition.\n\nAnother thing I know is that all points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, I have two hyperbola equations and one condition from the rhombus.\n\nAlso, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint.\n\nMoreover, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nWait, the diagonals are AC and BD. Let me compute their slopes.\n\nSlope of AC: ( -b - b ) / (-a - a ) = (-2b)/(-2a) = b/a.\n\nSlope of BD: (-d - d)/(-c - c) = (-2d)/(-2c) = d/c.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1:\n\n(b/a) * (d/c) = -1.\n\nSo, (bd)/(ac) = -1.\n\nBut from earlier, we have ac + bd = 0. Which can be rewritten as bd = -ac.\n\nSubstituting into (bd)/(ac) = -1:\n\n(-ac)/(ac) = -1 \u2192 (-1) = -1. So, that's consistent. So, that doesn't give a new condition, just confirms the earlier result.\n\nSo, I need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the length of the diagonal from B to D.\n\nSince B is (c, d) and D is (-c, -d), the distance BD is sqrt[( -c - c )\u00b2 + ( -d - d )\u00b2] = sqrt[(-2c)^2 + (-2d)^2] = sqrt[4c\u00b2 +4d\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, I need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all possible such rhombuses.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2? Or the minimum BD\u00b2? Wait, no, wait. The problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because we're looking for the maximum value that is still less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. So, essentially, the minimum BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the maximum of all numbers m such that m \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because m has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so the largest such m is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily small, then the greatest lower bound is 0. But in this case, since points are on a hyperbola, perhaps there is a lower bound.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So, as x becomes large, y also becomes large, but for points on the hyperbola, the coordinates can't be zero. Wait, but the origin is where the diagonals meet, but the points themselves can approach the origin? Wait, but the hyperbola doesn't pass through the origin, because plugging (0,0) gives 0 -0 =1, which is not true. So, all points A, B, C, D are away from the origin.\n\nWait, but can the points approach the origin? Let me see. For example, as x approaches sqrt(20*(1 + y\u00b2/24)). So, if y approaches zero, x approaches sqrt(20). So, the closest points to the origin on the hyperbola are (\u00b1sqrt(20), 0). So, the minimal distance from the origin to a point on the hyperbola is sqrt(20), which is about 4.472.\n\nSo, points A and C can't be closer than sqrt(20) to the origin. Similarly for B and D.\n\nWait, but in our case, points A and B are on the hyperbola, but their coordinates are connected via the rhombus condition.\n\nWait, maybe I should parameterize the points.\n\nLet me consider parametric equations for the hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, parametric equations can be x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8. Alternatively, hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t. Or maybe x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t.\n\nBut perhaps using hyperbola parametrization would complicate things because of the rhombus conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express points A and B in terms of vectors, since the origin is the midpoint.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent points A and B as vectors. Let me denote vector OA = (a, b), vector OB = (c, d). Since diagonals intersect at origin, OA + OC = 0, so OC = -OA, same for OD = -OB.\n\nIn a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the vectors AB and AD have the same length.\n\nWait, vector AB is OB - OA = (c - a, d - b).\n\nVector AD is OD - OA = (-c - a, -d - b).\n\nSo, |AB|\u00b2 = |AD|\u00b2.\n\nWhich gives (c -a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (-c -a)^2 + (-d -b)^2.\n\nExpanding both:\n\nLeft: c\u00b2 -2ac +a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2.\n\nRight: c\u00b2 + 2ac +a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2.\n\nSet equal:\n\nc\u00b2 -2ac +a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + 2ac +a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2ac -2bd = 2ac + 2bd.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-4ac -4bd =0 \u2192 ac + bd =0.\n\nSo, we have ac + bd =0.\n\nAdditionally, since A and B are on the hyperbola:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, we have two equations from the hyperbola and one equation from the rhombus condition.\n\nOur goal is to find BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), and find the greatest lower bound m such that m \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombi.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, since m has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so the maximum such m is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, I need to minimize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, given that c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1 and ac + bd=0, with a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Let me see if I can relate a and c, b and d.\n\nFrom ac + bd =0, I can write d = (-ac)/b, assuming b \u22600.\n\nBut then, substituting into the hyperbola equation for B:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSubstituting d:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - ( (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/(b\u00b2 *24) ) =1.\n\nFactor out c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [1/20 - (a\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - (a\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2)].\n\nBut from point A's hyperbola equation: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 Let me solve for a\u00b2: a\u00b2 = 20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, a\u00b2 =20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24 =20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, plug that into the denominator:\n\n1/20 - ( (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 ) ) / (24 b\u00b2 )\n\nWait, let me compute (a\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2):\n\n= (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 b\u00b2 )\n\n= [20/(24 b\u00b2)] + [ (5 b\u00b2)/(6 *24 b\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (5)/(6 b\u00b2) + (5)/(144)\n\nSo, the denominator becomes:\n\n1/20 - [5/(6 b\u00b2) +5/144 ]\n\nSo, c\u00b2 =1 / [1/20 -5/(6 b\u00b2) -5/144 ].\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I can express everything in terms of b\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote k = b\u00b2. Then, a\u00b2 =20 + (5k)/6.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 -5/(6k) -5/144 ]\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n1/20 = 7.2/144,\n\n5/(6k) = (120)/(144k),\n\n5/144 =5/144.\n\nSo, denominator is:\n\n7.2/144 -120/(144k) -5/144 = (7.2 -5)/144 - 120/(144k) = 2.2/144 - 120/(144k) = (11/720) - (5)/(6k).\n\nWait, 7.2 is 72/10 =36/5, so 7.2/144 =36/(5*144)= 36/(720)=1/20. Wait, maybe that approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me find a common denominator for the terms in the denominator.\n\nThe terms are 1/20, 5/(6k), 5/144.\n\nLet me find a common denominator for 20, 6k, and 144. Hmm, perhaps 144k.\n\nExpress each term:\n\n1/20 = (7.2k)/144k,\n\n5/(6k) = (120)/144k,\n\n5/144 = (5k)/144k.\n\nWait, 1/20 = (144k/20)/144k = (7.2k)/144k.\n\nHmm, maybe this isn't the best approach. Let me instead combine the terms:\n\n1/20 -5/(6k) -5/144 = [ (144k) - (5*20*144k)/(6k) - (5*20) ] / (20*144k)\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting too convoluted. Maybe I should instead express everything in terms of a single variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of parametrizing A and B, I can use some other approach.\n\nWait, another thought: since the diagonals are perpendicular, and the rhombus is centered at the origin, perhaps I can model the rhombus as having diagonals along certain lines.\n\nWait, if the diagonals are perpendicular, then perhaps I can let one diagonal lie along a line y = m x, and the other along y = (-1/m) x, so that they are perpendicular.\n\nBut since the diagonals intersect at the origin, points A and C are on one diagonal, B and D on the other.\n\nSo, points A and C lie along y = m x, and points B and D lie along y = (-1/m) x.\n\nBut since A and C are on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, for point A on y = m x: substituting y = m x into hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (m\u00b2 x\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nFactor x\u00b2: x\u00b2 (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 ) =1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 =1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 ) =1 / [ (6 -5 m\u00b2 ) / 120 ] =120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, x = \u00b1 sqrt(120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 )).\n\nSimilarly, y = m x = \u00b1 m sqrt(120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 )).\n\nSo, points A and C are ( sqrt(120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 )), m sqrt(120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 )) ) and its opposite.\n\nSimilarly, points B and D are on the other diagonal y = (-1/m) x.\n\nSubstituting into hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - ( (1/m\u00b2 ) x\u00b2 ) /24 =1.\n\nx\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 )) =1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 =1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 )) =1 / [ (12 m\u00b2 -5 ) / (240 m\u00b2 ) ] =240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nSo, x = \u00b1 sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )).\n\nAnd y = (-1/m) x = \u2213 sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) / m = \u2213 sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )).\n\nSo, points B and D are ( sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )), - sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) ) and its opposite.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the lengths of the sides in terms of m.\n\nLet me compute the distance between A and B.\n\nPoint A: ( sqrt(120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 )), m sqrt(120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 )) )\n\nPoint B: ( sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )), - sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) )\n\nCompute the squared distance AB\u00b2:\n\n[ sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) - sqrt(120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 )) ]\u00b2 + [ - sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) - m sqrt(120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 )) ]\u00b2.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the rhombus can be represented as having vectors along the diagonals, which are perpendicular. The area of the rhombus is (d1 * d2)/2, but not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the rhombus can be thought of as formed by vectors along the diagonals. Let me denote vectors OA and OB as the diagonals. Wait, no, OA and OC are diagonals, but they are perpendicular.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes, but in this case, they are perpendicular and intersect at the origin.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the rhombus as having vertices at (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s), with the condition that (p, q) and (r, s) are such that the sides are equal.\n\nBut I think this is similar to what I did before.\n\nWait, going back to the previous approach, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of m.\n\nFrom earlier, points B and D are ( sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )), - sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) ) and (- sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )), sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) ).\n\nSo, BD is the distance between B and D. Wait, no, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is the distance between (sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )), - sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) ) and (- sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )), sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) ).\n\nSo, BD is the distance between these two points. So, let's compute BD\u00b2.\n\nThe x-coordinate difference: [ - sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) - sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) ] = -2 sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )).\n\nSimilarly, y-coordinate difference: [ sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) - (- sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) ) ] = 2 sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [ -2 sqrt(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) ]\u00b2 + [ 2 sqrt(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) ]\u00b2\n\n= 4*(240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) + 4*(240 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )).\n\nFactor out 4/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ):\n\n= [4/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ) ] * (240 m\u00b2 + 240 )\n\n= [4 * 240 (m\u00b2 +1) ] / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\n= 960 (m\u00b2 +1) / (12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 960 (m\u00b2 +1) / (12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nNow, our goal is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 as m varies over all real numbers such that the denominators are positive, i.e., 6 -5 m\u00b2 >0 and 12 m\u00b2 -5 >0.\n\nWait, for the points A and C, the denominator 6 -5 m\u00b2 must be positive because we have sqrt(120/(6 -5 m\u00b2 )). So, 6 -5 m\u00b2 >0 \u2192 m\u00b2 <6/5.\n\nSimilarly, for points B and D, denominator 12 m\u00b2 -5 must be positive \u2192 12 m\u00b2 -5 >0 \u2192 m\u00b2 >5/12.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 must satisfy 5/12 < m\u00b2 <6/5.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 \u2208 (5/12, 6/5).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of m\u00b2 in this interval.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =960 (m\u00b2 +1)/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nWe can let t = m\u00b2, where t \u2208 (5/12, 6/5).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) =960 (t +1)/(12 t -5 ).\n\nWe need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2(t) over t \u2208 (5/12, 6/5).\n\nSo, to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2(t), we can find the minimum of f(t) = (t +1)/(12 t -5 ) for t \u2208 (5/12, 6/5).\n\nBecause 960 is a positive constant multiplier.\n\nSo, let me compute f(t) = (t +1)/(12 t -5 ).\n\nLet me compute the derivative of f(t) to find its extrema.\n\nf'(t) = [ (1)(12t -5) - (t +1)(12) ] / (12t -5 )\u00b2\n\n= [12t -5 -12t -12 ] / (12t -5 )\u00b2\n\n= [ -17 ] / (12t -5 )\u00b2.\n\nSo, f'(t) = -17 / (12t -5 )\u00b2.\n\nSince the denominator is squared, it's always positive, so f'(t) is negative for all t in (5/12, 6/5). So, f(t) is decreasing on this interval.\n\nTherefore, the minimum of f(t) occurs at the right endpoint of the interval, t=6/5.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum of f(t) occurs at the left endpoint, t=5/12.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2(t) is when t is as large as possible, i.e., t=6/5.\n\nSo, let's compute f(6/5):\n\nf(6/5) = (6/5 +1)/(12*(6/5) -5 ) = (11/5)/(72/5 -25/5 )= (11/5)/(47/5 )=11/47.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =960*(11/47 )= (960 *11)/47.\n\nCompute that: 960 \u00f747 is approximately 20.4255, multiplied by11 is around 224.68.\n\nBut wait, I need to compute it exactly.\n\n960 *11 =10560.\n\n10560 /47 = let's compute:\n\n47*224=47*(200+24)=47*200=9400 +47*24=1128 \u2192 9400+1128=10528.\n\n10560 -10528=32.\n\nSo, 10560 /47=224 +32/47=224 + 32/47\u2248224.6808.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=10560/47\u2248224.6808.\n\nBut wait, since the function f(t) is decreasing, the minimal BD\u00b2 is at t=6/5, which is the maximum t. So, BD\u00b2 is minimized at t=6/5.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the infimum is the minimal BD\u00b2, but actually, if BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, but in our case, as t approaches 5/12 from above, f(t) approaches (5/12 +1)/(12*(5/12) -5 )= (17/12)/(5 -5)= undefined, but wait, wait, t approaches 5/12 from above, denominator 12t -5 approaches zero from positive side.\n\nWait, f(t)=(t +1)/(12t -5).\n\nAs t approaches 5/12 from above, denominator approaches zero, numerator approaches (5/12 +1)=17/12. So, f(t) approaches +infinity.\n\nAs t approaches 6/5 from below, denominator approaches 12*(6/5) -5=72/5 -25/5=47/5, numerator approaches (6/5 +1)=11/5.\n\nSo, f(t) approaches 11/47.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 960*(11/47)=10560/47\u2248224.6808.\n\nBut wait, is this the minimal BD\u00b2? Because as t approaches 5/12 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, and as t approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 10560/47.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 10560/47, but the infimum is that value.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 10560/47\u2248224.6808.\n\nBut wait, can BD\u00b2 actually attain this value? Because when t=6/5, let's see if that's possible.\n\nIf t=6/5, then m\u00b2=6/5, so m=\u00b1\u221a(6/5). Then, let's check the denominator for points B and D: 12 m\u00b2 -5=12*(6/5) -5=72/5 -25/5=47/5>0, so it's valid.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can attain 10560/47.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 10560/47, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/47, because BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 10560/47 from above, but not below.\n\nWait, no. Because if the minimal BD\u00b2 is 10560/47, then 10560/47 is the smallest BD\u00b2 can be. So, all BD\u00b2 are greater than or equal to 10560/47.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum, which is 10560/47, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u226510560/47.\n\nWait, but wait. When t approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 10560/47, which is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 10560/47. So, all BD\u00b2 are at least 10560/47. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/47, because BD\u00b2 is always larger than or equal to 10560/47.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 10560/47, then 10560/47 is the infimum. So, any number less than 10560/47 would not satisfy being less than all BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can be as low as 10560/47.\n\nWait, no, wait. If BD\u00b2 can be as small as 10560/47, then 10560/47 is the minimum. So, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 \u226510560/47. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum, which is 10560/47.\n\nBut wait, the wording is a bit confusing. It says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the maximum m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut if BD\u00b2 can be made as small as 10560/47, then m cannot be larger than 10560/47, because otherwise, for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=10560/47, m would not be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the greatest such m is 10560/47.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If BD\u00b2 can attain 10560/47, then m must be less than that. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 10560/47, then m must be less than 10560/47.\n\nWait, no, because m has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than or equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, because otherwise, for the rhombus with BD\u00b2= minimal, m would not be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. If the minimal BD\u00b2 is m0=10560/47, then for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 \u2265m0. So, the numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi are numbers \u2264m0, because if I choose m =m0, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=m0, m is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, to have m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, m must be less than m0. Therefore, the greatest such m is the infimum, which is m0. But wait, if m is allowed to be equal, but the problem says \"less than.\"\n\nSo, the supremum of all m such that m \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is m0. But since the problem says \"less than,\" the supremum would be m0, but not including m0. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is m0, but since m0 is attainable, it's actually the limit.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of it differently.\n\nSuppose I have a set S = { BD\u00b2 | ABCD is a rhombus on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at origin }.\n\nWe found that S has a minimum value of 10560/47 \u2248224.6808.\n\nSo, S is [10560/47, \u221e).\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, i.e., m < s for all s \u2208 S.\n\nBut since S includes 10560/47, any m must be less than 10560/47, because otherwise, for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=10560/47, m would not be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because if m is less than 10560/47, then for other rhombi where BD\u00b2 is larger, m will still be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, because otherwise, for the rhombus with BD\u00b2 equal to the minimal, m would not be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the maximal such m is the minimal BD\u00b2. But wait, if m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2. Because if the minimal BD\u00b2 is m0, then m has to be less than m0, because otherwise, for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=m0, m would not be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf m is a number such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2. Because if m is equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=m, m is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the maximum m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the minimal BD\u00b2 minus epsilon, but since we need the greatest such m, it's the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be exactly m0=10560/47, the supremum of m is m0, but m must be strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so m must be \u2264m0. Wait, but m has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the one where BD\u00b2=m0. So, m must be less than m0.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the maximum m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because if m is equal to the infimum, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=infimum, m is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, the supremum of all m satisfying m \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of BD\u00b2. But the problem wants m < BD\u00b2 for all, so m must be less than the infimum.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because if BD\u00b2 can be as small as m0, then m has to be less than m0 to satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but the infimum is m0, so for any m < m0, m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 \u2265m0 >m.\n\nSo, the greatest such m is approaching m0 from below, but not reaching it. But in the problem statement, they probably expect the exact value, which is m0=10560/47.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it this way: the minimal BD\u00b2 is 10560/47. So, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u226510560/47. Therefore, any number less than 10560/47 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 10560/47, because you can't have a number greater than 10560/47 that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, no. Because if m is equal to 10560/47, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=10560/47, m is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, m has to be less than 10560/47.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the supremum is 10560/47, but since it's not included, the greatest real number is 10560/47.\n\nWait, but in real numbers, there's no greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because you can approach 10560/47 as closely as you like. So, the supremum is 10560/47, but it's not attainable. So, the answer is 10560/47.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 10560/47.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, earlier I found that f(t) is decreasing, so the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs at t=6/5, which gives BD\u00b2=10560/47\u2248224.6808.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 10560/47, which is approximately 224.68.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again.\n\nBD\u00b2=960*(t +1)/(12 t -5 )\n\nAt t=6/5,\n\nt +1=6/5 +5/5=11/5,\n\n12t -5=12*(6/5)-5=72/5 -25/5=47/5,\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=960*(11/5)/(47/5)=960*(11/47)= (960*11)/47=10560/47.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 10560/47, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/47.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because I might have messed up the parametrization.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to minimize BD\u00b2 given the constraints.\n\nBut that might take longer, but let me try.\n\nWe need to minimize 4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 ), given that c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1 and ac + bd=0, and a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nLet me consider variables a, b, c, d.\n\nFrom ac + bd=0, I can write d= - (ac)/b.\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation for B:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - ( (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/(b\u00b2 *24) )=1.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 [1/20 - a\u00b2/(24 b\u00b2) ]=1.\n\nFrom point A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1 \u2192 a\u00b2=20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, a\u00b2=20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSubstituting into the equation for c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [1/20 - (20 +5 b\u00b2/6 )/(24 b\u00b2) ]=1.\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 +5 b\u00b2/6 ) / (24 b\u00b2) ]\n\n=1/20 - [20/(24 b\u00b2) + (5 b\u00b2)/(6*24 b\u00b2) ]\n\n=1/20 - [5/(6 b\u00b2) +5/(144) ]\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2=1 / [1/20 -5/(6 b\u00b2) -5/144 ]\n\nLet me compute this denominator:\n\nFind a common denominator, which would be 144 b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 =7.2 b\u00b2/(144 b\u00b2),\n\n5/(6 b\u00b2)=120/(144 b\u00b2),\n\n5/144=5 b\u00b2/(144 b\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator= (7.2 b\u00b2 -120 -5 b\u00b2 ) / (144 b\u00b2 )\n\n= (2.2 b\u00b2 -120 ) / (144 b\u00b2 )\n\nWait, 7.2 b\u00b2 -5 b\u00b2=2.2 b\u00b2, and then -120.\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2=1 / [ (2.2 b\u00b2 -120 ) / (144 b\u00b2 ) ] =144 b\u00b2 / (2.2 b\u00b2 -120 )\n\nHmm, 2.2 is 11/5, so 2.2=11/5.\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2=144 b\u00b2 / ( (11/5) b\u00b2 -120 )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by5:\n\n=720 b\u00b2 / (11 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSo, c\u00b2=720 b\u00b2/(11 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSimilarly, from point A, a\u00b2=20 +5 b\u00b2/6.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 ).

So, f'(u) <0 for all u>54.545.\n\nTherefore, f(u) is decreasing for u>54.545.\n\nThus, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs at the minimal u, which is u approaching 54.545 from above.\n\nSo, as u approaches 54.545+, BD\u00b2 approaches:\n\n(3480*(54.545) +14400 )/(11*(54.545 ) -600 )\n\nCompute denominator:11*54.545=600, so denominator approaches 0.\n\nNumerator:3480*54.545=3480*(54 +0.545 )=3480*54 +3480*0.545.\n\n3480*54= (3000*54)+(480*54)=162,000 +25,920=187,920.\n\n3480*0.545\u22483480*0.5=1740 +3480*0.045\u2248156.6=1740+156.6=1896.6.\n\nSo, numerator\u2248187,920 +1896.6 +14,400=187,920+1896.6=189,816.6 +14,400=204,216.6.\n\nDenominator approaches 0 from positive side.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches +infinity as u approaches 54.545 from above.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the parametrization with m, I found that BD\u00b2 approaches 10560/47\u2248224.68 when m\u00b2 approaches 6/5=1.2.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up in the parametrization.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I used m as the slope of AC, leading to t=m\u00b2, and found that BD\u00b2=960 (t+1)/(12 t -5 ), which is minimized at t=6/5, giving BD\u00b2=10560/47\u2248224.68.\n\nIn the second approach, using substitution with u=b\u00b2, I found BD\u00b2(u)= (3480 u +14400 )/(11 u -600 ), which is decreasing for u>54.545, so minimal when u approaches 54.545 from above, but that would make BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x\u00b2.\n\nPoints A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points must be arranged such that if one point is (x, y), the opposite point is (-x, -y). So, for example, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, B would be (u, v) and D would be (-u, -v).\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, but they aren't necessarily equal in length. The diagonals are AC and BD in this case. The diagonals intersect at the origin, so their midpoints are at the origin.\n\nSo, points A and C are opposite, as are B and D. Therefore, the diagonals AC and BD are straight lines passing through the origin.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals aren't necessarily aligned with the axes. So, the diagonals can be any lines passing through the origin, but they have to satisfy the rhombus properties.\n\nLet me think about the properties of a rhombus. All sides are equal in length, and the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular to each other.\n\nSo, if I can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola such that the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, and then see what the conditions are for the rhombus.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. But since AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v). Their dot product should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 \u21d2 4(xu + yv) = 0 \u21d2 xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, the condition for the diagonals being perpendicular is xu + yv = 0.\n\nBut since A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, they must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. Let's see, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Each of these sides should have the same length.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2. Point A is (x, y), point B is (u, v). The vector AB is (u - x, v - y), so AB\u00b2 = (u - x)\u00b2 + (v - y)\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2 = ( -u - u)^2 + (-v - v)^2? Wait, no, point C is (-x, -y), so BC is from B(u, v) to C(-x, -y). So, BC vector is (-x - u, -y - v). So, BC\u00b2 is (-x - u)\u00b2 + (-y - v)\u00b2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2.\n\nSimilarly, CD\u00b2 is ( -x - (-u), -y - (-v) )^2 = (u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2, same as AB\u00b2.\n\nAnd DA\u00b2 is from D(-u, -v) to A(x, y): (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2, same as BC\u00b2.\n\nSo, for the sides to be equal, AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2.\n\nSo, (u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2.\n\nRight: x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\nu\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting common terms from both sides:\n\n-2ux -2vy = 2ux + 2vy.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2ux -2vy -2ux -2vy = 0 \u21d2 -4ux -4vy = 0 \u21d2 4ux + 4vy = 0 \u21d2 ux + vy = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had xu + yv = 0 from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, this is the same condition.\n\nSo, the condition that diagonals are perpendicular is the same as the condition that all sides are equal. That makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular if and only if all sides are equal.\n\nSo, the key condition is xu + yv = 0.\n\nNow, points A(x, y) and B(u, v) lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nWe also have xu + yv = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nBD is from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v). So, the vector BD is (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). So, BD\u00b2 is (-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 = 4u\u00b2 + 4v\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 = 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut we need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, find the supremum of BD\u00b2 and then take the infimum of that?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi? Or is it the maximum lower bound?\n\nWait, let me read it again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, and this number is the largest such.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and the answer will be the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum of the lower bounds. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of optimization.\n\nLet me try to express BD\u00b2 in terms of variables, given the constraints.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nWe have xu + yv = 0.\n\nAnd points A(x, y) and B(u, v) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, from the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24),\nu\u00b2 = 20(1 + v\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4[20(1 + v\u00b2/24) + v\u00b2] = 4[20 + (20 v\u00b2)/24 + v\u00b2] = 4[20 + (5 v\u00b2)/6 + v\u00b2] = 4[20 + (11 v\u00b2)/6].\n\nWait, that can't be right because u\u00b2 = 20(1 + v\u00b2/24), so u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20 + (20 v\u00b2)/24 + v\u00b2 = 20 + (5 v\u00b2)/6 + v\u00b2 = 20 + (11 v\u00b2)/6. So, yes, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + (11 v\u00b2)/6 ) = 80 + (44 v\u00b2)/6 = 80 + (22 v\u00b2)/3.\n\nBut that seems too variable-dependent. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, since xu + yv = 0, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me try to parametrize points A and B.\n\nSince A(x, y) is on the hyperbola, let's use hyperbola parametrization.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8).\n\nSo, here a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nSo, let me set A as (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B(u, v) can be another point on the hyperbola. But since xu + yv = 0, let's express u and v in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSo, x = 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, y = 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8.\n\nu and v must satisfy xu + yv = 0 \u21d2 (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) u + (2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) v = 0.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n\u221a5 sec\u03b8 * u + \u221a6 tan\u03b8 * v = 0.\n\nLet me solve for u in terms of v.\n\n\u221a5 sec\u03b8 * u = -\u221a6 tan\u03b8 * v \u21d2 u = (-\u221a6 / \u221a5) (tan\u03b8 / sec\u03b8) v.\n\nSimplify tan\u03b8 / sec\u03b8: tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8, sec\u03b8 = 1/cos\u03b8, so tan\u03b8 / sec\u03b8 = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, u = (-\u221a6 / \u221a5) sin\u03b8 * v.\n\nSo, u = (-\u221a6 / \u221a5) sin\u03b8 * v.\n\nSo, now, since point B(u, v) is on the hyperbola, u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting u from above:\n\n[ ( (-\u221a6 / \u221a5 sin\u03b8 v )\u00b2 ] /20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n( (6 / 5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) v\u00b2 ) /20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 v\u00b2 ) / (5 * 20) - v\u00b2/24 = 1 \u21d2 (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 v\u00b2 ) / 100 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFactor out v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 [ (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/100 - 1/24 ] = 1.\n\nCompute the coefficient:\n\nLet me compute (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/100 - 1/24.\n\nLet me write both terms with denominator 600:\n\n(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/100 = (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/600,\n\n1/24 = 25/600.\n\nSo, the coefficient is (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/600.\n\nSo, v\u00b2 * (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/600 = 1 \u21d2 v\u00b2 = 600 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSo, v\u00b2 = 600 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nBut since v\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator must be positive. So, 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 > 0 \u21d2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 > 25/36 \u21d2 |sin\u03b8| > 5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 must satisfy |sin\u03b8| > 5/6.\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nWe can express u\u00b2 and v\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom earlier, u = (-\u221a6 / \u221a5 sin\u03b8 ) v.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = (6 / 5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) v\u00b2.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (6/(5 sin\u00b2\u03b8) + 1) v\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(6/(5 sin\u00b2\u03b8) + 1)*v\u00b2.\n\nBut we have v\u00b2 = 600 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(6/(5 sin\u00b2\u03b8) + 1)*(600 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)).\n\nLet me compute this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 6/(5 sin\u00b2\u03b8) +1:\n\n= (6 + 5 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/(5 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(6 +5 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/(5 sin\u00b2\u03b8) * (600)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4 * 600 = 2400.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 2400*(6 +5 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/(5 sin\u00b2\u03b8*(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n5 sin\u00b2\u03b8*(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25) = 5*(36 sin^4 \u03b8 -25 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 2400*(6 +5 sin\u00b2\u03b8) / (5*(36 sin^4 \u03b8 -25 sin\u00b2\u03b8)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n2400 /5 = 480.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(6 +5 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/(36 sin^4 \u03b8 -25 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nFactor numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 6 +5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 =5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +6.\n\nDenominator: 36 sin^4 \u03b8 -25 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +6)/(sin\u00b2\u03b8(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)).\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can set t = sin\u00b2\u03b8. Since |sin\u03b8| >5/6, t >25/36.\n\nSo, let me let t = sin\u00b2\u03b8, where t >25/36.\n\nThen,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(5t +6)/(t(36 t -25)).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(5t +6)/(36 t\u00b2 -25t).\n\nNow, to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, I can treat this as a function f(t) = (5t +6)/(36t\u00b2 -25t), for t >25/36.\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of f(t) for t >25/36, because BD\u00b2 is proportional to f(t), and we need the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, f(t) = (5t +6)/(36t\u00b2 -25t).\n\nLet me compute the derivative of f(t) with respect to t to find critical points.\n\nFirst, f(t) = (5t +6)/(36t\u00b2 -25t).\n\nLet me write f(t) = N(t)/D(t), where N =5t +6, D=36t\u00b2 -25t.\n\nThen, f\u2019(t) = (N\u2019 D - N D\u2019)/D\u00b2.\n\nCompute N\u2019 =5.\n\nCompute D\u2019=72t -25.\n\nSo,\n\nf\u2019(t) = [5*(36t\u00b2 -25t) - (5t +6)*(72t -25)] / (36t\u00b2 -25t)^2.\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\nFirst term: 5*(36t\u00b2 -25t) = 180t\u00b2 -125t.\n\nSecond term: (5t +6)(72t -25).\n\nMultiply this out:\n\n5t*72t = 360t\u00b2,\n\n5t*(-25) = -125t,\n\n6*72t = 432t,\n\n6*(-25) = -150.\n\nSo, altogether: 360t\u00b2 -125t +432t -150 = 360t\u00b2 +307t -150.\n\nSo, the second term is 360t\u00b2 +307t -150.\n\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\n[180t\u00b2 -125t] - [360t\u00b2 +307t -150] =\n\n180t\u00b2 -125t -360t\u00b2 -307t +150 =\n\n(180t\u00b2 -360t\u00b2) + (-125t -307t) +150 =\n\n-180t\u00b2 -432t +150.\n\nSo, numerator is -180t\u00b2 -432t +150.\n\nSet f\u2019(t) = 0 \u21d2 numerator =0.\n\nSo,\n\n-180t\u00b2 -432t +150 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n180t\u00b2 +432t -150=0.\n\nDivide all terms by 6:\n\n30t\u00b2 +72t -25=0.\n\nNow, solve for t using quadratic formula:\n\nt = [-72 \u00b1 sqrt(72^2 -4*30*(-25))]/(2*30).\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n72^2 = 5184,\n\n4*30*25=3000,\n\nSo, discriminant =5184 +3000=8184.\n\nsqrt(8184)= let's compute:\n\n8184 \u00f74=2046,\n\n2046 \u00f72=1023, which is prime? 1023 \u00f73=341, which is 11*31.\n\nSo, sqrt(8184)=sqrt(4*2046)=2*sqrt(2046). But 2046=2*3*11*31, so sqrt(2046) is irrational.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, 72^2 = 5184,\n\n4*30*25=3000,\n\nSo, discriminant is 5184 +3000=8184.\n\nLet me see: 8184=4*2046=4*(2*1023)=8*1023.\n\nWait, 1023 is 3*11*31, so sqrt(8184)=sqrt(8*1023)=2*sqrt(2*1023)=2*sqrt(2046). So, yeah, it's irrational.\n\nSo, t = [ -72 \u00b1 2\u221a2046 ] /60.\n\nBut t must be greater than25/36\u22480.6944.\n\nSo, compute the positive root:\n\nt = [ -72 + 2\u221a2046 ] /60.\n\nCompute sqrt(2046):\n\nsqrt(2025)=45, sqrt(2046)= approx 45.23.\n\nSo, 2*45.23\u224890.46.\n\nSo, numerator\u2248-72 +90.46\u224818.46.\n\nThen, t\u224818.46 /60\u22480.3077.\n\nBut 0.3077 <25/36\u22480.6944, so this root is less than 25/36, which is our domain lower bound.\n\nThe other root would be negative, since [ -72 - something positive ] /60 is negative. So, no solution in t>25/36.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the derivative doesn't cross zero in t>25/36, then f(t) is either always increasing or always decreasing in that interval.\n\nLet me check the behavior of f(t) as t approaches 25/36 from above and as t approaches infinity.\n\nFirst, as t approaches 25/36 from above:\n\nt approaches 25/36\u22480.6944.\n\nCompute denominator 36t\u00b2 -25t: at t=25/36,\n\n36*(625/1296) -25*(25/36)= (22500/1296) - (625/36)= (22500/1296 - 625*36/1296)=\n\n22500 - 22500 =0. So, denominator approaches 0.\n\nNumerator:5t +6 at t=25/36 is 5*(25/36)+6=125/36 +216/36=341/36\u22489.472.\n\nSo, as t approaches 25/36+, denominator approaches 0 from positive side? Let's see.\n\nDenominator:36t\u00b2 -25t= t(36t -25).\n\nAt t=25/36, 36t=25, so denominator=25/36*(25 -25)=0.\n\nFor t>25/36, 36t -25>0, so denominator is positive.\n\nSo, as t approaches 25/36 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches ~9.472, so f(t) approaches +infty.\n\nAs t approaches infinity:\n\nf(t) = (5t +6)/(36t\u00b2 -25t) \u22485t /36t\u00b2=5/(36t)\u21920.\n\nSo, f(t) approaches 0 as t\u2192infty.\n\nSo, the function f(t) decreases from +infty to 0 as t increases from 25/36 to infinity.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed the derivative, I found that f\u2019(t) is negative because numerator is -180t\u00b2 -432t +150, which is negative for t>25/36, because at t=1, for example, numerator is -180 -432 +150= -462, which is negative. So, f\u2019(t) is negative for all t>25/36. So, f(t) is strictly decreasing in t>25/36.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs as t approaches infinity, but as t increases, f(t) approaches 0, so BD\u00b2 approaches 0. But that can't be possible because BD is a diagonal of the rhombus, which must have a certain length.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If BD\u00b2 approaches zero, but BD is a diagonal, which can't be zero. So, perhaps I made a mistake in parametrization or in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe my parametrization is incorrect because when I set A as (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8), and B as some other point on the hyperbola, but the condition xu + yv =0 might restrict the possible points. So, perhaps when t increases, meaning sin\u00b2\u03b8 increases, point A is moving towards the asymptotes.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 can't be zero. So, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is when t is as large as possible, but t can go to infinity, but BD\u00b2 approaches 0.\n\nBut that can't be right because the hyperbola extends to infinity, so points A and B can be taken very far away, making the rhombus very large. Wait, but in our case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the rhombus is centered at the origin. So, as points A and B go to infinity, BD might also go to infinity.\n\nWait, but from the earlier expression, BD\u00b2 =480*(5t +6)/(36t\u00b2 -25t).\n\nAs t\u2192infty, BD\u00b2 \u2248480*(5t)/(36t\u00b2)=480*5/(36t)=2400/(36t)=200/t\u21920. So, BD\u00b2 approaches zero as t increases. That seems contradictory.\n\nBut perhaps my approach is wrong because as t increases, the point A goes to infinity, but point B also goes to infinity, but in a way that the rhombus still maintains the condition xu + yv=0.\n\nWait, maybe instead of taking t to infinity, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs at t=25/36, but t must be greater than 25/36.\n\nWait, at t=25/36, f(t) is undefined because denominator is zero. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 would be approached as t approaches 25/36 from above, but BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be right because as t approaches 25/36, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is zero, but that can't be right because BD\u00b2 is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Since BD is a diagonal of the rhombus, and the rhombus is determined by two points A and B on the hyperbola with xu + yv=0.\n\nBut maybe instead of parametrizing, I can use the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus.\n\nLet me consider the vectors OA and OB, which are (x, y) and (u, v). Since xu + yv=0, the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nSo, OA \u00b7 OB =0.\n\nGiven that OA and OB are vectors from the origin to points on the hyperbola, and they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps we can use the concept of conjugate diameters in hyperbola.\n\nIn an ellipse, conjugate diameters have certain properties, but in hyperbola, similar concepts exist.\n\nBut I'm not too familiar with that. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that OA and OB are perpendicular vectors on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, OA \u00b7 OB=0, and both OA and OB lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1,\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24=1,\n\nand xu + yv=0.\n\nWe can think of this as a system of equations.\n\nLet me consider the two points A(x, y) and B(u, v) on the hyperbola such that OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWe can treat this as an optimization problem where we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 subject to u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24=1 and xu + yv=0, where x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize u and v in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom xu + yv=0, we can express v = - (xu)/y.\n\nSubstitute into hyperbola equation:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 u\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 u\u00b2)/(y\u00b2 *24)=1.\n\nFactor u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)] =1.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 =1 / [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)].\n\nBut from point A's hyperbola equation: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, substitute x\u00b2 into u\u00b2 expression:\n\nu\u00b2 =1 / [1/20 - (20(1 + y\u00b2/24))/(24 y\u00b2)].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\nLet me compute the denominator step by step.\n\nDenominator D =1/20 - [20(1 + y\u00b2/24)]/(24 y\u00b2).\n\nFirst, compute [20(1 + y\u00b2/24)]/(24 y\u00b2):\n\n= [20/(24 y\u00b2) + (20 y\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2)]\n\n= (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + (5/6).\n\nSo,\n\nD=1/20 - (5/(6 y\u00b2) +5/6).\n\nSo,\n\nD=1/20 -5/6 -5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nCompute 1/20 -5/6:\n\nConvert to common denominator 60:\n\n1/20=3/60,\n\n5/6=50/60,\n\nSo, 3/60 -50/60= -47/60.\n\nSo,\n\nD= -47/60 -5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2=1 / [ -47/60 -5/(6 y\u00b2) ].\n\nBut u\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator must be negative.\n\nSo,\n\n-47/60 -5/(6 y\u00b2) <0 \u21d2 -5/(6 y\u00b2) <47/60 \u21d2 5/(6 y\u00b2) > -47/60.\n\nBut 5/(6 y\u00b2) is always positive since y\u00b2>0, so this inequality holds. So, u\u00b2 is positive.\n\nBut we have u\u00b2=1/[ -47/60 -5/(6 y\u00b2) ]=1/[ (-47 y\u00b2 -50 )/(60 y\u00b2) ]=60 y\u00b2/( -47 y\u00b2 -50 ).\n\nWait, denominator is negative, so u\u00b2=60 y\u00b2/( -47 y\u00b2 -50 )= -60 y\u00b2/(47 y\u00b2 +50).\n\nBut u\u00b2 must be positive, so this suggests a negative value, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let's recompute denominator D.\n\nD=1/20 - [20(1 + y\u00b2/24)]/(24 y\u00b2).\n\nCompute [20(1 + y\u00b2/24)]/(24 y\u00b2):\n\n= [20/(24 y\u00b2) + (20 y\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2)]\n\n= (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + (5/6).\n\nSo, D=1/20 -5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/6.\n\nSo,\n\nD= (1/20 -5/6) -5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\n1/20 -5/6 = (3 -50)/60 = -47/60.\n\nSo,\n\nD= -47/60 -5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, D is negative.\n\nThus, u\u00b2=1/D is negative, which is impossible. So, this suggests that our assumption is wrong somewhere.\n\nWait, this can't be right because we have points A and B on the hyperbola with OA perpendicular to OB. So, such points must exist.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in expressing v in terms of u.\n\nFrom xu + yv=0, we have v= -xu/y.\n\nBut if y=0, then point A is at (\u00b12\u221a5, 0). But y=0 isn't allowed because then v would be zero, but point B would have to be on the hyperbola, which at y=0 is x\u00b2=20, so (\u00b12\u221a5,0). But then xu + yv=0 becomes x u +0=0 \u21d2 x u=0. Since x=\u00b12\u221a5\u22600, u must be zero. But u=0 would imply point B is (0, v), but (0, v) isn't on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1. So, y can't be zero.\n\nSo, y\u22600, v\u22600.\n\nSo, perhaps I can consider the ratio of u and v.\n\nFrom xu + yv=0 \u21d2 u = (-y/x) v.\n\nSo, u = (-y/x) v.\n\nSubstitute into hyperbola equation:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 [ (y\u00b2/x\u00b2) v\u00b2 ] /20 - v\u00b2/24=1.\n\nFactor v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 [ y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) -1/24 ]=1.\n\nFrom point A's hyperbola equation: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 y\u00b2=24(x\u00b2/20 -1)= (24/20)x\u00b2 -24= (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, y\u00b2= (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSubstitute into v\u00b2 expression:\n\nv\u00b2 [ ( (6/5 x\u00b2 -24) ) / (20 x\u00b2) -1/24 ]=1.\n\nSimplify the term in the brackets:\n\n= [ (6x\u00b2 -120)/5/(20x\u00b2) ) -1/24 ]\n\nWait, let me compute step by step.\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2):\n\n= [ (6/5 x\u00b2 -24) ] / (20 x\u00b2 )= (6/5 x\u00b2)/(20 x\u00b2) -24/(20 x\u00b2 )= (6)/(100) -24/(20 x\u00b2 )= 3/50 - 6/(5 x\u00b2).\n\nSo, the term in brackets is:\n\n3/50 -6/(5 x\u00b2) -1/24.\n\nCombine terms:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 600.\n\n3/50 = 36/600,\n\n-6/(5x\u00b2)= -720/(600 x\u00b2),\n\n-1/24= -25/600.\n\nSo,\n\n36/600 -25/600 -720/(600 x\u00b2)= (11/600) -720/(600 x\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 [ 11/(600) -720/(600 x\u00b2) ]=1.\n\nFactor out 1/600:\n\nv\u00b2 [ (11 -720/x\u00b2 ) /600 ]=1 \u21d2 v\u00b2=600/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nBut from point A's hyperbola equation, x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nBut earlier, y\u00b2= (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24)=20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nBut y\u00b2= (6/5)x\u00b2 -24, so:\n\nx\u00b2=20 + (5/6)( (6/5 x\u00b2 -24 ))=20 + (5/6)(6/5 x\u00b2) - (5/6)(24)=20 +x\u00b2 -20.\n\nSo, x\u00b2= x\u00b2. Which is an identity, so no new information.\n\nWait, so going back, v\u00b2=600/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nBut x\u00b2 must satisfy the hyperbola equation, so x\u00b2>20.\n\nSo, x\u00b2>20 \u21d2720/x\u00b2 <720/20=36.\n\nSo, 11 -720/x\u00b2>11 -36= -25.\n\nSo, denominator 11 -720/x\u00b2 can be positive or negative.\n\nIf 11 -720/x\u00b2 >0 \u21d2720/x\u00b2 <11 \u21d2x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, for x\u00b2>65.45, denominator is positive, and v\u00b2=600/(positive)=positive.\n\nFor 20 <x\u00b2 <65.45, denominator is negative, so v\u00b2=600/(negative)=negative, which is impossible.\n\nSo, only possible when x\u00b2>65.45.\n\nSo, x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, in this case, v\u00b2=600/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nWe can write this as v\u00b2=600/( (11 x\u00b2 -720)/x\u00b2 )=600 x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSo, v\u00b2=600 x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSimilarly, since u= (-y/x)v, and y\u00b2= (6/5)x\u00b2 -24,\n\ny= sqrt( (6/5)x\u00b2 -24 ).\n\nSo, u= (-y/x)v= -sqrt( (6/5)x\u00b2 -24 ) /x *v.\n\nBut this might not be necessary.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2=4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2).\n\nFrom earlier, u\u00b2= [ y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) -1/24 ]^{-1} *1.\n\nWait, no, from earlier, we have:\n\nFrom u\u00b2= [ y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) -1/24 ]^{-1}.\n\nBut y\u00b2= (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2= [ ( (6/5 x\u00b2 -24 )/(20 x\u00b2) ) -1/24 ]^{-1}.\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n= (6/5 x\u00b2 -24)/(20 x\u00b2) -1/24.\n\n= (6/(100) -24/(20 x\u00b2)) -1/24.\n\n= (3/50 - 6/(5 x\u00b2)) -1/24.\n\n= 3/50 -1/24 -6/(5 x\u00b2).\n\nConvert to common denominator 600:\n\n3/50=36/600,\n\n1/24=25/600,\n\n6/(5x\u00b2)=720/(600 x\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n36/600 -25/600 -720/(600 x\u00b2)=11/600 -720/(600 x\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2= [11/(600) -720/(600 x\u00b2 ) ]^{-1}= [ (11 -720/x\u00b2)/600 ]^{-1}=600/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nBut from earlier, v\u00b2=600 x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -720)=600/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ) *x\u00b2/(x\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, v\u00b2=600 x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -720)=600/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, u\u00b2=600/(11 -720/x\u00b2 )=v\u00b2.\n\nWait, so u\u00b2=v\u00b2.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 +v\u00b2=2u\u00b2=2v\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=4*2u\u00b2=8u\u00b2.\n\nBut u\u00b2=600/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=8*(600)/(11 -720/x\u00b2 )=4800/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nBut x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, let me write BD\u00b2=4800/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nLet me set t=x\u00b2>720/11.\n\nThen,\n\nBD\u00b2=4800/(11 -720/t )=4800/( (11t -720)/t )=4800t/(11t -720).\n\nWe need to find the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4800t/(11t -720).\n\nLet me compute derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to t to find minima.\n\nLet me denote f(t)=4800t/(11t -720).\n\nCompute f\u2019(t):\n\nf\u2019(t)= [4800*(11t -720) -4800t*11 ]/(11t -720)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n4800*(11t -720 -11t )=4800*(-720)= -4800*720.\n\nSo,\n\nf\u2019(t)= (-4800*720)/(11t -720)^2.\n\nSince denominator is squared, it's positive. So, f\u2019(t) is negative for all t>720/11.\n\nSo, f(t) is decreasing function for t>720/11.\n\nThus, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs as t approaches infinity, which makes BD\u00b2 approach 4800t/(11t)=4800/11\u2248436.36.\n\nBut as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 4800/11.\n\nWait, but earlier, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2=4800t/(11t)=4800/11. So, BD\u00b2 approaches 4800/11\u2248436.36.\n\nBut since f(t) is decreasing, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4800/11, and BD\u00b2 can be made larger by choosing smaller t.\n\nWait, but when t approaches 720/11 from above, denominator approaches 11*(720/11) -720=720 -720=0. So, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as large as we want, but the infimum is 4800/11\u2248436.36.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 4800/11 from above, but never less than that. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 4800/11.\n\nWait, but 4800/11 is approximately 436.36, but the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 4800/11 as possible, but never less. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 4800/11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 4800/11.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2=4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=4*(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2).\n\nBut earlier, we found that u\u00b2=v\u00b2, so u\u00b2 +v\u00b2=2u\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*2u\u00b2=8u\u00b2.\n\nAnd u\u00b2=600/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nBut from hyperbola equation, x\u00b2=20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nWait, but we also have y\u00b2= (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 must satisfy x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=8u\u00b2=8*(600)/(11 -720/x\u00b2 )=4800/(11 -720/x\u00b2 ).\n\nLet me set s= x\u00b2.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=4800/(11 -720/s ).\n\nWe can write this as BD\u00b2=4800 s/(11s -720).\n\nWe need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 as s approaches infinity.\n\nAs s\u2192infty, BD\u00b2\u22484800 s/(11s)=4800/11\u2248436.36.\n\nSo, the infimum is 4800/11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 4800/11.\n\nSo, the answer is 4800/11, which is approximately 436.36.\n\nBut let me check if 4800/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, because as s increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 4800/11 from above. So, BD\u00b2 can be as close as desired to 4800/11, but never less than that. So, 4800/11 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 4800/11.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 4800/11, but never less, then 4800/11 is the infimum. Therefore, the answer is 4800/11.\n\nBut let me compute 4800 divided by 11.\n\n4800 \u00f711=436.3636...\n\nSo, the answer is 4800/11.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus formed by points on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\). The diagonals intersect at the origin, implying the points are symmetric about the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular, leading to the condition \\(xu + yv = 0\\) for points \\(A(x, y)\\) and \\(B(u, v)\\) on the hyperbola.\n\nUsing the hyperbola equation and the perpendicularity condition, we express \\(BD^2\\) in terms of variables and simplify. Through parametrization and optimization, we find that the minimal value of \\(BD^2\\) approaches \\(\\frac{4800}{11}\\) as the points move further along the hyperbola. Thus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{4800}{11}}\\).",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? So if the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So points A, B, C, D are such that the midpoints of the diagonals are at (0,0). \n\nSince the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin, the rhombus must also be symmetric with respect to both axes. So, if point A is (x,y), then point C would be (-x,-y), because it's opposite across the origin. Similarly, the other two points B and D would be somewhere else, maybe symmetric in another way.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, all four points lie on this hyperbola.\n\nIn a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees, but in this case, since the hyperbola is involved, I'm not sure if they are perpendicular. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, regardless of the hyperbola. So, diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin. So, if I can find the points such that the diagonals are perpendicular lines through the origin, and all four points lie on the hyperbola, then I can model the problem.\n\nLet me think about parametrizing the points. Suppose that the diagonals are the lines y = m x and y = (-1/m) x, since they need to be perpendicular. So, one diagonal, say AC, is along y = m x, and the other diagonal BD is along y = (-1/m) x.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily the axes of symmetry of the hyperbola, but they are just lines through the origin. So, points A and C lie on y = m x, and points B and D lie on y = (-1/m) x.\n\nSo, let's denote points A and C as (a, m a) and (-a, -m a), respectively. Similarly, points B and D would be (b, (-1/m) b) and (-b, (1/m) b), respectively.\n\nBut all these points need to lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, substituting point A into the hyperbola equation:\n\na\u00b2 / 20 - (m\u00b2 a\u00b2) / 24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B:\n\nb\u00b2 / 20 - ( (1/m\u00b2) b\u00b2 ) / 24 = 1.\n\nSo, I can write these as:\n\nFor A: a\u00b2 (1/20 - m\u00b2 /24 ) = 1.\n\nFor B: b\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) ) = 1.\n\nHmm, okay, so I can solve for a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 in terms of m.\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 from the first equation:\n\na\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2 /24 )\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) )\n\nWait, but 1/20 - m\u00b2 /24 must not be zero, so m\u00b2 \u2260 24/20 = 6/5. Similarly, the denominator for b\u00b2 must not be zero, so 1/(24 m\u00b2) \u2260 1/20, which implies m\u00b2 \u2260 20/24 = 5/6.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 cannot be 6/5 or 5/6. That makes sense because if m\u00b2 were 6/5, then the denominator for a\u00b2 would be zero, which would mean the hyperbola is tangent to the line y = m x, but perhaps that's a case we need to avoid.\n\nNow, the diagonals AC and BD have lengths 2a and 2b, respectively. So, the lengths of the diagonals are 2a and 2b.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for BD\u00b2. So, BD is the length of the diagonal BD, which is 2b. So, BD\u00b2 would be (2b)^2 = 4b\u00b2.\n\nSo, I need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2, which is 4b\u00b2, over all possible m, and then find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. Wait, no. Wait, the question says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. So, it's like, find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombuses. So, essentially, find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be the infimum.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, it's the supremum of all numbers that are less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. So, it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2 across all rhombuses. Because if I can find the minimum possible BD\u00b2, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be that minimum.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Suppose BD\u00b2 can be as small as some value, say m, and as large as infinity. Then, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be m, because for any number larger than m, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 smaller than that number. So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4b\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nSo, let's express BD\u00b2 in terms of m:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4b\u00b2 = 4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) ]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 / [ (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) ) ]\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) = (24 m\u00b2 - 20) / (20 * 24 m\u00b2 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 / [ (24 m\u00b2 - 20) / (480 m\u00b2) ) ] = 4 * (480 m\u00b2) / (24 m\u00b2 - 20 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n480 / 4 = 120, so 4 * (480 m\u00b2) = 1920 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 1920 m\u00b2 / (24 m\u00b2 - 20 )\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify this expression.\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\n1920 m\u00b2 / (24 m\u00b2 - 20) = (1920 m\u00b2) / [ 4*(6 m\u00b2 - 5) ) ] = (480 m\u00b2) / (6 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (480 m\u00b2) / (6 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nNow, since the hyperbola equation must be satisfied, the denominators in the expressions for a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 must be positive, right? Because a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, for a\u00b2, 1/20 - m\u00b2 /24 > 0 \u2192 m\u00b2 < 24/20 = 6/5.\n\nSimilarly, for b\u00b2, 1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) > 0 \u2192 1/(24 m\u00b2) < 1/20 \u2192 24 m\u00b2 > 20 \u2192 m\u00b2 > 20/24 = 5/6.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 must be between 5/6 and 6/5.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 \u2208 (5/6, 6/5).\n\nSo, let me denote t = m\u00b2. Then t \u2208 (5/6, 6/5).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes (480 t) / (6 t -5 )\n\nLet me write this as BD\u00b2 = 480 t / (6 t -5 )\n\nSo, I need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2 as t varies in (5/6, 6/5).\n\nSo, to find the minimum of BD\u00b2, let's consider the function f(t) = 480 t / (6 t -5 ), for t \u2208 (5/6, 6/5).\n\nWait, but when t approaches 5/6 from above, the denominator 6t -5 approaches zero from above, so f(t) approaches infinity. Similarly, when t approaches 6/5 from below, the denominator approaches 6*(6/5) -5 = 36/5 -25/5 = 11/5, so f(t) approaches 480*(6/5) / (11/5) ) = 480*(6/5)*(5/11) ) = 480*6 /11 \u2248 257. So, as t approaches 6/5, f(t) approaches 480*(6/5)/(11/5) = 480*6/11 \u2248 257.18.\n\nBut we need the minimum of f(t) over t in (5/6,6/5). Let's compute the derivative of f(t) to find its critical points.\n\nCompute f'(t):\n\nf(t) = (480 t) / (6 t -5 )\n\nUsing the quotient rule: f'(t) = [480*(6t -5) - 480 t *6 ] / (6t -5)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n480*(6t -5) - 480*6 t = 480*6t - 480*5 - 2880 t = (2880 t - 2400) -2880 t = -2400.\n\nSo, f'(t) = (-2400) / (6t -5)^2.\n\nWhich is always negative because numerator is negative and denominator is positive (since t >5/6, 6t -5 >0, so denominator squared is positive). So, f(t) is decreasing on (5/6,6/5).\n\nSo, since f(t) is decreasing, its minimum occurs at the right endpoint of the interval, which is t =6/5.\n\nBut wait, when t approaches 6/5 from below, f(t) approaches 480*(6/5)/(6*(6/5)-5) ) = let's compute that:\n\n6*(6/5) =36/5, so denominator is 36/5 -25/5=11/5.\n\nSo, f(t) approaches (480*(6/5)) / (11/5) )= (480*6/5)*(5/11) )=480*6 /11=2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought as t approaches 6/5, f(t) approaches approximately 257.18. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 480*(6/5) is 480*1.2 = 576. 576 divided by 11/5 is 576 *5/11= 2880/11\u2248261.818. Right, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t approaches 6/5, but in reality, t cannot be equal to 6/5, because then the denominator for a\u00b2 would be zero, which is not allowed. So, t approaches 6/5 from below, and f(t) approaches 2880/11.\n\nSimilarly, when t approaches 5/6 from above, f(t) approaches infinity.\n\nSo, since f(t) is decreasing on (5/6,6/5), the minimal value of f(t) is 2880/11, but it's approached as t approaches 6/5. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 2880/11.\n\nBut wait, is 2880/11 the minimal BD\u00b2? Or is it the limit as t approaches 6/5.\n\nWait, but since t cannot be equal to 6/5, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 2880/11, but never actually reaches it. Similarly, as t approaches 5/6, BD\u00b2 becomes very large.\n\nSo, the minimal value that BD\u00b2 approaches is 2880/11, but it's not attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but the question is a bit tricky. It says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 2880/11. Because for any number less than 2880/11, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number. Wait, no, actually, since BD\u00b2 can get as close to 2880/11 as we like, but can't be smaller than that. So, the infimum is 2880/11, meaning that for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < 2880/11 + \u03b5. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 2880/11, because any number larger than that would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually, the question is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 2880/11. Because for any \u03b5>0, you can have a BD\u00b2 as close as 2880/11 + \u03b5, but not less than 2880/11.\n\nWait, no, wait. The infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. But the problem says, \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all numbers that are less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nSo, in other words, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because if I take any number less than the infimum, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number, which would make that number not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, the supremum of all such numbers is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2880/11, which is approximately 261.818.\n\nBut let me confirm if my calculations are correct.\n\nWait, f(t) = 480t/(6t-5). Its derivative is -2400/(6t-5)^2, which is always negative, so f(t) is decreasing on (5/6,6/5). So, the minimum BD\u00b2 is approached as t approaches 6/5, which is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but 2880 divided by 11 is 261.818... So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 2880/11, and since BD\u00b2 can't be smaller than that, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but wait, is that correct? Because if BD\u00b2 can approach 2880/11, then for any number less than 2880/11, say 2880/11 - \u03b5, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number. So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would actually be 2880/11, because any number larger than that would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. Wait, but that's not possible because BD\u00b2 can be as small as just above 2880/11.\n\nWait, perhaps I have to think in terms of the supremum of lower bounds. So, the set of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is the interval (-\u221e, 2880/11). So, the greatest such number is 2880/11, but since BD\u00b2 can't be less than that, 2880/11 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum, because that's the greatest lower bound. So, the answer is 2880/11.\n\nSo, 2880 divided by 11 is equal to 261 and 9/11, which is approximately 261.818. So, as a fraction, it's 2880/11.\n\nLet me see if I can reduce that fraction. 2880 and 11 have no common factors because 11 is a prime number and 11 doesn't divide 2880 (since 2880 \u00f7 11 is approximately 261.818). So, 2880/11 is the simplest form.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again because I might have made a mistake in the derivative or the setup.\n\nWait, when I set up BD\u00b2 as 4b\u00b2, and then b\u00b2 = 1/(1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)).\n\nSo, b\u00b2 = 1/( (24 m\u00b2 -20)/(24*20 m\u00b2) )) = 24*20 m\u00b2 / (24 m\u00b2 -20 )\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 1/(1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) = 1/( (24 m\u00b2 -20)/(24*20 m\u00b2) ) = (24*20 m\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 -20 )\n\nWhich is 480 m\u00b2/(24 m\u00b2 -20 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4b\u00b2=4*(480 m\u00b2/(24 m\u00b2 -20 ))= 1920 m\u00b2/(24 m\u00b2 -20 )\n\nWait, earlier I think I had 480 m\u00b2/(6 m\u00b2 -5 ), which is correct because 24 m\u00b2 -20 = 4*(6 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nSo, 1920 m\u00b2/(24 m\u00b2 -20 )= 1920 m\u00b2/(4*(6 m\u00b2 -5 ))=480 m\u00b2/(6 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, f(t)=480 t/(6 t -5 )\n\nAnd f'(t)= -2400/(6 t -5 )\u00b2, which is always negative, so f(t) is decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but wait, when t approaches 6/5, m\u00b2 approaches 6/5, so m approaches sqrt(6/5). Then, the point B is (b, (-1/m)b ), which would be on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, substituting t=6/5 into f(t):\n\nf(6/5)=480*(6/5)/(6*(6/5) -5 )= (480*6/5)/(36/5 -25/5)= (576)/(11/5)=576*(5/11)=2880/11.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 2880/11, which is approximately 261.818.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 2880/11, but never less than that, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is indeed 2880/11.\n\nWait, but hold on, 2880/11 is approximately 261.818, and BD\u00b2 can be as small as just above that. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be 2880/11, because for any number larger than that, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if I pick a number larger than 2880/11, say 2880/11 + 1, then BD\u00b2 can be 2880/11 + 0.5, which is less than 2880/11 +1. So, in that case, the number 2880/11 +1 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, because some rhombuses have BD\u00b2 less than that number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The question is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 2880/11. Because for any number greater than 2880/11, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number. So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be the infimum, which is 2880/11.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. If I take the infimum, which is 2880/11, then for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < 2880/11 + \u03b5. So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 2880/11, because any number larger than that would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 2880/11, so I should present that as the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that is the infimum of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombuses. Since BD\u00b2 can approach 2880/11 from above, the infimum is 2880/11, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but 2880/11 is approximately 261.818. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, 2880 \u00f7 11: 11*261=2871, so 2880-2871=9, so 261 and 9/11, which is 261.818... So, yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2880/11, which is the infimum of BD\u00b2, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 2880/11.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, implying the rhombus is symmetric about both axes.\n\nLet the diagonals be \\( AC \\) along \\( y = mx \\) and \\( BD \\) along \\( y = -\\frac{1}{m}x \\). Points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are \\((a, ma)\\) and \\((-a, -ma)\\), while points \\( B \\) and \\( D \\) are \\((b, -\\frac{b}{m})\\) and \\((-b, \\frac{b}{m})\\).

Substituting \\( b^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nBD^2 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{24m^2}} = \\frac{480m^2}{6m^2 - 5}.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( t = m^2 \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, forming a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus has its diagonals bisecting each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, hold on. No, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, actually, no, I think in a rhombus the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at 90 degrees and bisect each other. So, that's an important point.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, with its diagonals intersecting there.\n\nSo, the points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nWait, but for a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they bisect each other at right angles. So, if I can find the lengths of the diagonals, I can find BD\u00b2, and then find the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, or perhaps the minimum possible BD\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD\u00b2 can vary, and I need the supremum of the lower bounds. So, perhaps the minimum value BD\u00b2 can take is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum itself? Wait, maybe I need to find the minimum possible BD\u00b2, because then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the minimum BD\u00b2. Hmm, but that might not necessarily be the case. Wait, no, because if BD\u00b2 can take a range of values, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some value from above, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that infimum.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by parameterizing the points on the hyperbola.\n\nSince the rhombus is centered at the origin, the points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, let's say that the diagonals AC and BD are along the coordinate axes. Wait, is that necessarily the case? Hmm, because the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, but the diagonals could be at any angle, not necessarily aligned with the axes. Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to assume that they are aligned with the axes, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, the diagonals are perpendicular, but they don't have to align with the coordinate axes. So, perhaps I should consider the diagonals as vectors. Let me denote point A as (x, y), then since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be at some other points on the hyperbola such that the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, actually, OA and OB would be perpendicular because the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors from the origin to A and B are perpendicular, meaning their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, if point A is (x, y), then point B would be (u, v), such that x*u + y*v = 0.\n\nBut both A and B lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, so (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 and (u\u00b2)/20 - (v\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use the properties of the rhombus and the hyperbola to find the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B in terms of angles or something. Let me think.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the rhombus is determined by two perpendicular vectors from the origin. So, points A and C are along one line through the origin, and points B and D are along another line through the origin, perpendicular to the first.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if I take a line through the origin, say with direction vector (p, q), then points A and C would be at (kp, kq) and (-kp, -kq) respectively, for some scalar k. Similarly, since the other diagonal is perpendicular, its direction vector would be (-q, p) or (q, -p), so points B and D would be at (lm, -lp) and (-lm, lp), where m and p are the components of the perpendicular direction.\n\nWait, maybe I can represent points A and C as (a, b) and (-a, -b), and points B and D as (c, d) and (-c, -d). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: a*c + b*d = 0.\n\nAlso, since A and B lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\n(a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1,\n\n(c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, that gives us two equations.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nWait, the distance from A to B is sqrt[(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2], and the distance from B to C is sqrt[(c - (-a))^2 + (d - (-b))^2] = sqrt[(c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2].\n\nSince it's a rhombus, these distances should be equal. So,\n\nsqrt[(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2] = sqrt[(a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2].\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n(a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2) = (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2).\n\nSubtracting the right side from the left:\n\n-2ac -2bd = 2ac + 2bd.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-4ac -4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nac + bd = 0.\n\nBut we already have ac + bd = 0 from the perpendicularity condition. So, this doesn't give us any new information.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal, so vectors AB and AD should have the same length.\n\nWait, vectors AB would be (c - a, d - b), and vectors AD would be (-c - a, -d - b). The lengths of these vectors must be equal.\n\nSo,\n\n(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (-c - a)^2 + (-d - b)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n(c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2) = (c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2).\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: c\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ac - 2bd.\n\nRight side: c\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSubtract right from left:\n\n-4ac -4bd = 0.\n\nWhich again gives ac + bd = 0, same as before.\n\nSo, this approach isn't giving me any new information. Maybe I should consider the properties of the rhombus in terms of its diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, the area can be expressed as (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, since the sides are equal and the diagonals are perpendicular, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals. For a rhombus, each side is equal to sqrt[(d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2].\n\nSo, if I let the diagonals be AC and BD, with lengths 2p and 2q respectively, then each side of the rhombus is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, the points A, B, C, D must satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, point A is (p, 0) if AC is along the x-axis, but wait, no. Wait, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the axes. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola such that OA and OB are perpendicular. Then, points A and C are (x, y) and (-x, -y), and points B and D are (u, v) and (-u, -v). Since OA and OB are perpendicular, their dot product is zero: x*u + y*v = 0.\n\nAdditionally, since A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that this leads to ac + bd = 0, which is already satisfied because OA and OB are perpendicular. So, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the coordinates of A and B in terms of angles, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use parametric equations of the hyperbola.\n\nThe standard parametric equations for a hyperbola are x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8, where a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24, so a = sqrt(20) = 2\u221a5, and b = sqrt(24) = 2\u221a6.\n\nSo, point A can be (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8), and point B, being perpendicular, would have a parameter \u03c6 such that OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nSo, the coordinates of B would be (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6).\n\nTheir dot product is zero:\n\n(2\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6) + (2\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) + (24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6) = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express tan in terms of sec.\n\nWe know that tan\u03b8 = sqrt(sec\u00b2\u03b8 - 1), but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express everything in terms of sine and cosine.\n\nLet me rewrite:\n\n5 * (1/cos\u03b8) * (1/cos\u03c6) + 6 * (sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8) * (sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6) = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n5 + 6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n5 + 6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = 0.\n\nWhich implies,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, that's a useful relation.\n\nNow, since points A and B are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are AC and BD, which are along the lines connecting (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) and (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8), and similarly for B and D.\n\nNow, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1. Wait, but we already used that in the dot product condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, the diagonal BD connects points B and D, which are (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) and (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). So, the length of BD is the distance between these two points.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6 - (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6))\u00b2 + (2\u221a6 tan\u03c6 - (-2\u221a6 tan\u03c6))\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (4\u221a5 sec\u03c6)^2 + (4\u221a6 tan\u03c6)^2.\n\nWhich is:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 16*5 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 16*6 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, that's an expression for BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6. But I also have the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 from earlier.\n\nWait, but I need to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6. Alternatively, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of a single variable.\n\nWait, since sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and we can express tan\u03b8 and tan\u03c6 in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find an expression for BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, let me think. Since sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and points A and B are on the hyperbola, perhaps we can find a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express tan\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, let me consider that:\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6,\n\nWe can write sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nBut since sin\u03c6 must be between -1 and 1, this constrains sin\u03b8 such that |5/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u2264 1, which implies |sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is such that sin\u03b8 \u2265 5/6 or sin\u03b8 \u2264 -5/6.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03c6, sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8), so the sign depends on \u03b8.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express tan\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWe know that tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6.\n\nFrom sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8), we can write cos\u03c6 = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) = sqrt(1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)).\n\nBut this might complicate things, as we have square roots. Alternatively, perhaps I can express tan\u03c6 in terms of tan\u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express BD\u00b2 in terms of tan\u03b8 and use the relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2 = 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe can express sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 (1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut I need to relate this to \u03b8.\n\nFrom earlier, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me try to express tan\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWe have sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nSo, cos\u03c6 = sqrt(1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)).\n\nHmm, but this leads to sqrt( (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ).\n\nSo, cos\u03c6 = sqrt(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25) / (6 |sin\u03b8| ).\n\nBut since we have to consider the sign, perhaps it's better to write cos\u03c6 = \u00b1 sqrt(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25) / (6 |sin\u03b8| ).\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of parametrizing with \u03b8, I can consider points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular, and both lie on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me consider point A as (x, y) and point B as (u, v), with x*u + y*v = 0.\n\nSo, points A and B lie on the hyperbola, and their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nand x*u + y*v = 0.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, etc., are equal. So, perhaps the vectors AB and AD should have the same length.\n\nWait, point A is (x, y), point B is (u, v), point D is (-u, -v), since diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\nWait, no, because if point B is (u, v), then point D is (-u, -v), because diagonals bisect each other at the origin.\n\nWait, but then the vectors AB and AD would be:\n\nAB = (u - x, v - y),\n\nAD = (-u - x, -v - y).\n\nThe lengths of these vectors should be equal:\n\nsqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2] = sqrt[(-u - x)^2 + (-v - y)^2].\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2.\n\nExpanding:\n\nu\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + 2vy + y\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-4ux -4vy = 0,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nux + vy = 0.\n\nBut from the perpendicularity condition, we have x*u + y*v = 0.\n\nSo, that's consistent. So, this doesn't give any new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express u and v in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom x*u + y*v = 0,\n\nWe can write v = (-x*u)/y.\n\nNow, since point B lies on the hyperbola,\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting v,\n\nu\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 u\u00b2)/(y\u00b2 * 24) = 1.\n\nFactor u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nHmm, so u\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)].\n\nBut from point A's equation,\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nWhich can be rearranged to y\u00b2 = (24/20)(x\u00b2 - 20).\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (6/5)(x\u00b2 - 20).\n\nNow, substituting y\u00b2 into the expression for u\u00b2,\n\nu\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 * (6/5)(x\u00b2 - 20))].\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24*(6/5)(x\u00b2 - 20)).\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n24*(6/5) = 144/5,\n\nSo, denominator becomes:\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/( (144/5)(x\u00b2 - 20) )\n\n= 1/20 - (5 x\u00b2)/(144 (x\u00b2 - 20)).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n= [144 (x\u00b2 - 20)] / [20 * 144 (x\u00b2 - 20)] - [5 x\u00b2 * 20] / [20 * 144 (x\u00b2 - 20)]\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to find a common denominator.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nDenominator D = 1/20 - (5 x\u00b2)/(144 (x\u00b2 - 20)).\n\n= [144 (x\u00b2 - 20) * 1 - 20 * 5 x\u00b2 ] / [20 * 144 (x\u00b2 - 20)].\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n144(x\u00b2 - 20) - 100x\u00b2.\n\n= 144x\u00b2 - 144*20 -100x\u00b2.\n\n= (144x\u00b2 -100x\u00b2) - 2880.\n\n= 44x\u00b2 - 2880.\n\nSo, D = (44x\u00b2 - 2880) / [20*144 (x\u00b2 - 20)].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n44x\u00b2 - 2880 = 4*(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nDenominator: 20*144 = 2880.\n\nSo, D = [4*(11x\u00b2 - 720)] / [2880 (x\u00b2 - 20)].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (11x\u00b2 - 720) / [720 (x\u00b2 - 20)].\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = 1 / D = [720 (x\u00b2 - 20)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nHmm, so u\u00b2 = [720 (x\u00b2 - 20)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nSimilarly, since u\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator and numerator must have the same sign.\n\nSo, 11x\u00b2 - 720 and x\u00b2 - 20 must be both positive or both negative.\n\nLet's check when x\u00b2 > 720/11 \u2248 65.45.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 -20 > 45.45, which is positive, so both numerator and denominator are positive.\n\nAlternatively, if x\u00b2 < 720/11, then denominator is negative, and x\u00b2 -20 < 45.45, which could be positive or negative.\n\nWait, but for point A to lie on the hyperbola, x\u00b2 must be greater than 20, because x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so x\u00b2 \u2265 20.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 \u2265 20.\n\nSo, if 20 \u2264 x\u00b2 < 720/11 \u2248 65.45, then denominator 11x\u00b2 - 720 is negative, and x\u00b2 -20 is positive. So, numerator and denominator have opposite signs, making u\u00b2 negative, which is impossible. So, in that case, u\u00b2 would be negative, which is not possible, so such points A and B cannot exist when 20 \u2264 x\u00b2 < 720/11.\n\nWait, but then when x\u00b2 \u2265 720/11, both numerator and denominator are positive, so u\u00b2 is positive, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, this implies that point A must lie on the hyperbola where x\u00b2 \u2265 720/11 \u2248 65.45.\n\nHmm, that's an important point.\n\nSo, for points A and B to exist such that OA and OB are perpendicular and both lie on the hyperbola, x\u00b2 must be at least 720/11.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 \u2265 720/11.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = [720 (x\u00b2 - 20)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nSo, now, I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 is the square of the distance between points B and D, which are (u, v) and (-u, -v).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (u - (-u))\u00b2 + (v - (-v))\u00b2 = (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 = 4u\u00b2 + 4v\u00b2.\n\nBut from point B lying on the hyperbola, u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nSo, v\u00b2 = (24/20)(u\u00b2 - 20) = (6/5)(u\u00b2 - 20).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4u\u00b2 + 4*(6/5)(u\u00b2 -20).\n\n=4u\u00b2 + (24/5)u\u00b2 - (96/5).\n\n= [4 + 24/5] u\u00b2 - 96/5.\n\n= (20/5 +24/5) u\u00b2 - 96/5.\n\n= (44/5) u\u00b2 - 96/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44 u\u00b2 - 96)/5.\n\nNow, substituting u\u00b2 from earlier,\n\nu\u00b2 = [720 (x\u00b2 - 20)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (44 * [720 (x\u00b2 - 20)/(11x\u00b2 -720)] - 96)/5.\n\nHmm, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 44 * 720:\n\n44 * 720 = (40*720) + (4*720) = 28,800 + 2,880 = 31,680.\n\nSo,\n\n44 * [720 (x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720)] = 31,680 (x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [31,680 (x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720) - 96]/5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this expression.\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\n31,680 (x\u00b2 -20) - 96*(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n31,680 (x\u00b2 -20) = 31,680 x\u00b2 - 633,600.\n\n96*(11x\u00b2 -720) = 1,056 x\u00b2 - 69,120.\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator = (31,680 x\u00b2 - 633,600) - (1,056 x\u00b2 - 69,120).\n\n= 31,680 x\u00b2 - 633,600 -1,056 x\u00b2 +69,120.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(31,680 -1,056) x\u00b2 + (-633,600 +69,120).\n\n= 30,624 x\u00b2 - 564,480.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (30,624 x\u00b2 - 564,480) / [5*(11x\u00b2 -720)].\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Let me see if I can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\n30,624 x\u00b2 -564,480.\n\nFactor out 48:\n\n48*(638 x\u00b2 - 11,760).\n\nWait, 30,624 \u00f748 = 638, 564,480 \u00f748 =11,760.\n\nWait, 30,624 \u00f748: 48*600=28,800, 30,624-28,800=1,824, 1,824/48=38. So, 600+38=638.\n\nSimilarly, 564,480 \u00f748: 48*11,760=564,480.\n\nSo, numerator is 48*(638x\u00b2 - 11,760).\n\nDenominator:5*(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nHmm, perhaps 638 and 11 have a common factor? 638 \u00f711=58. So, 638=11*58.\n\nSo, numerator is 48*11*(58x\u00b2 - 1,069.09...).\n\nWait, 11,760 \u00f711=1,069.09? Wait, 11*1,069=11,759, which is 1 less than 11,760. So, 11,760=11*1,069 +1. Hmm, that's messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor 11x\u00b2 -720 as part of the numerator.\n\nWait, numerator: 30,624 x\u00b2 -564,480 = 30,624 x\u00b2 -564,480.\n\nWait, 30,624 = 30,624 = 30,624 \u00f711=2,784.\n\nWait, 30,624 \u00f711=2,784, because 11*2,784=30,624.\n\nSimilarly, 564,480 \u00f711=51,316.36, which is not an integer. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write BD\u00b2 as a function of x\u00b2, and then find its minimum value.\n\nLet me denote t = x\u00b2, where t \u2265720/11 \u224865.45.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [30,624 t -564,480]/[5*(11t -720)].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n30,624 t -564,480 = 30,624(t - 564,480/30,624).\n\nCompute 564,480 \u00f730,624:\n\n30,624 * 18 = 551,232.\n\n564,480 -551,232=13,248.\n\n30,624 \u00f713,248 \u22482.309.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to factor numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, 30,624 t -564,480 = 30,624(t) -564,480.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor 48:\n\n=48*(638t - 11,760).\n\nDenominator:5*(11t -720).\n\nHmm, perhaps write as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [48*(638t - 11,760)] / [5*(11t -720)].\n\nHmm, maybe I can express 638t -11,760 in terms of (11t -720).\n\nLet me compute 638 \u00f711=58, and 11,760 \u00f711=1,069.09, which isn't an integer. So, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform polynomial division.\n\nLet me write numerator as 638t - 11,760, and denominator as 11t -720.\n\nExpress 638t -11,760 = a*(11t -720) + b.\n\nFind a and b.\n\nSo,\n\n638t -11,760 = a*11t + a*(-720) + b.\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\n11a =638 \u2192 a=638/11=58.\n\nThen,\n\n-720a + b = -11,760.\n\nSubstitute a=58,\n\n-720*58 + b = -11,760.\n\nCompute 720*58:\n\n720*50=36,000,\n\n720*8=5,760,\n\nTotal=36,000+5,760=41,760.\n\nSo,\n\n-41,760 + b = -11,760 \u2192 b=41,760-11,760=30,000.\n\nSo,\n\n638t -11,760=58*(11t -720) +30,000.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2= [48*(58*(11t -720) +30,000)]/[5*(11t -720)].\n\n= [48*58*(11t -720) +48*30,000]/[5*(11t -720)].\n\n= [48*58 + (48*30,000)/(11t -720)] * (11t -720)/(5*(11t -720)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the fraction:\n\n= [48*(58*(11t -720))]/[5*(11t -720)] + [48*30,000]/[5*(11t -720)].\n\nSimplify first term:\n\n= (48*58)/5 + [48*30,000]/[5*(11t -720)].\n\n= (2,784)/5 + (2,880,000)/(5*(11t -720)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 556.8 + 576,000/(11t -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 556.8 + 576,000/(11t -720).\n\nHmm, since t \u2265720/11 \u224865.45, 11t -720 \u22650.\n\nSo, as t increases beyond 720/11, 11t -720 increases, making the second term smaller.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of t, and as t approaches 720/11 from above, 11t -720 approaches 0, so 576,000/(11t -720) approaches infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nAs t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 556.8.\n\nWait, but that suggests that BD\u00b2 has a minimum value of 556.8, and can be as large as desired. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 556.8, which is 556.8, but perhaps expressed as a fraction.\n\nWait, 556.8 is 5568/10 = 2784/5.\n\nWait, 2784 \u00f75=556.8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 2784/5 as t approaches infinity, but when t is at its minimum, 720/11, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when t is at its minimum, point A is at the minimal x\u00b2, which would make BD\u00b2 minimal. Wait, no, when t approaches 720/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. As t increases, BD\u00b2 decreases towards 2784/5.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 2784/5 by choosing t very large, but it can't be smaller than that. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 2784/5, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 2784/5.\n\nBut wait, let me check.\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, x\u00b2 is very large, so point A is far along the hyperbola. Then, point B would be such that u\u00b2 is approximately [720 (x\u00b2)]/(11x\u00b2) )= 720/11.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 approaches 720/11, so u approaches sqrt(720/11).\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 approaches 44/5 * (720/11) -96/5.\n\nWait, 44/5 *720/11 = (44*720)/(5*11) = (4*720)/5 = 2880/5=576.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 576 - 96/5 = 576 -19.2=556.8, which is 2784/5.\n\nSo, yes, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 2784/5.\n\nSo, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 2784/5, but BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to it from above. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 2784/5.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 2784/5 from above, then 2784/5 is the infimum, and thus the greatest lower bound. So, the answer would be 2784/5.\n\nBut let me confirm the calculation:\n\nWe had BD\u00b2 = [30,624 t -564,480]/[5*(11t -720)].\n\nWhich we simplified to 556.8 + 576,000/(11t -720).\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the second term approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 556.8, which is 2784/5.\n\nSo, 2784 \u00f75 is indeed 556.8.\n\nBut let me check if I made any miscalculations earlier.\n\nWait, when I expressed BD\u00b2 as (44 u\u00b2 -96)/5, and u\u00b2 as [720 (x\u00b2 -20)]/(11x\u00b2 -720), substituting that in gives BD\u00b2 as a function of x\u00b2.\n\nThen, after simplifying, I found BD\u00b2 in terms of t =x\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 556.8 + 576,000/(11t -720).\n\nWhich, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 556.8.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 556.8, and it can be as large as desired when t approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 2784/5, which is 556.8.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 2784/5, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 2784/5.\n\nWait, but 2784/5 is exactly 556.8, which is the limit as t approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches 556.8 but never actually reaches it. So, 556.8 is the infimum, and thus the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2784/5, which is 556.8.\n\nBut let me check if 2784/5 is correct.\n\nWait, 2784 divided by 5:\n\n5*556 = 2780,\n\n2784-2780=4,\n\nSo, 556 and 4/5, which is 556.8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 2784/5, which can be written as \\boxed{\\dfrac{2784}{5}}.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what it's asking for. \n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x\u00b2. The a\u00b2 is 20, so a is sqrt(20), which is 2*sqrt(5). The b\u00b2 is 24, so b is 2*sqrt(6). \n\nNow, there's a rhombus ABCD whose diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals cross each other at the origin. I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, wait no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. I think that's correct. Let me recall: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's right. So, in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and we need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD\u00b2, such that this number is less than BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombuses.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm. So, we're looking for the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2. So, like the infimum of BD\u00b2? Or perhaps the maximum value that is always less than BD\u00b2? Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, let me parse that again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, for all such rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number. So, this number is the supremum of the lower bounds for BD\u00b2. So, the maximum number such that BD\u00b2 is always larger than it, regardless of the rhombus. So, we're looking for the minimal possible BD\u00b2, but the greatest number that's less than all BD\u00b2. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, if I can find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, then that would be the number we're looking for, because any number less than that would not be a lower bound for all BD\u00b2, but this number would be the greatest such that it's less than all BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The problem says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number. So, this number is a lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all such rhombi. And we need the greatest such lower bound, which is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2 that can occur for such a rhombus, because that minimal BD\u00b2 would be the greatest lower bound. So, any number less than that minimal BD\u00b2 would not be a lower bound for all BD\u00b2, since some BD\u00b2 might be equal to that minimal. But wait, BD\u00b2 can't be smaller than that minimal, right? So, the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2 would be the minimal BD\u00b2. Wait, no. Wait, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as some value, say m, then m is the infimum, and any number less than m is also a lower bound, but the greatest lower bound is m. So, if m is the minimal BD\u00b2, then m is the greatest number less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the greatest number that is strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Hmm, that would be the infimum if the infimum is not achieved. Because if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to m, but never actually reaches m, then m would be the infimum, and any number less than m would be less than all BD\u00b2. But if BD\u00b2 can actually reach m, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be m itself, but that's only if BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to m. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and the answer is that minimal value. So, perhaps I should just find the minimal BD\u00b2 possible for such rhombuses.\n\nAlright, let's try to model this.\n\nSince the rhombus is centered at the origin and the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are perpendicular, as in a rhombus. So, the rhombus can be considered as having vertices at points (p, q), (-p, -q), (-q, p), (q, -p), perhaps? Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think about the coordinates.\n\nIn a rhombus with perpendicular diagonals intersecting at the origin, the vertices can be represented as (a, b), (-a, -b), (-b, a), (b, -a). Wait, is that correct? Let me see. If the diagonals are along the lines y = x and y = -x, then the vertices would be symmetric in that way. But maybe not necessarily.\n\nWait, actually, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so if one diagonal is along the x-axis, the other would be along the y-axis. So, if the diagonals are along the coordinate axes, then the rhombus would have vertices at (p, 0), (0, q), (-p, 0), (0, -q). Wait, but that's a kite, not a rhombus, unless p = q. Hmm, but if p \u2260 q, it's a kite. So, for a rhombus, all sides must be equal.\n\nWait, so in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nSo, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the rhombus is formed by points that are symmetric with respect to both axes and diagonals. So, perhaps the four points can be represented as (a, b), (-a, b), (-a, -b), (a, -b), but that would form a rectangle, not a rhombus, unless a = b.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the vertices are at (a, b), (-b, a), (-a, -b), (b, -a). Let me check.\n\nIf I take a point (a, b), then rotate it 90 degrees around the origin, it becomes (-b, a). So, if I connect (a, b) to (-b, a), then to (-a, -b), then to (b, -a), and back to (a, b), that would form a rhombus with diagonals along the lines y = x and y = -x. But in that case, the sides would be equal because of the rotation.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, the rhombus is inscribed in this hyperbola. So, all four points (a, b), (-b, a), (-a, -b), (b, -a) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, plugging in (a, b) into the hyperbola equation: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, plugging in (-b, a): (-b)\u00b2/20 - a\u00b2/24 = 1 \u21d2 b\u00b2/20 - a\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n2) b\u00b2/20 - a\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n(1) (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\n(2) (b\u00b2)/20 - (a\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations.\n\nLet me denote equation (1) as:\n\n(3a\u00b2 - 5b\u00b2)/120 = 1 \u21d2 3a\u00b2 -5b\u00b2 = 120\n\nEquation (2):\n\n(5b\u00b2 - 3a\u00b2)/120 = 1 \u21d2 5b\u00b2 -3a\u00b2 = 120\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n3a\u00b2 -5b\u00b2 = 120 ...(1)\n\n5b\u00b2 -3a\u00b2 = 120 ...(2)\n\nWait, if I add these two equations:\n\n(3a\u00b2 -5b\u00b2) + (5b\u00b2 -3a\u00b2) = 120 + 120 \u21d2 0 = 240, which is impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be. That suggests that there is no solution, which can't be correct because the problem states that such rhombuses exist.\n\nHmm, perhaps my assumption about the coordinates is wrong. Maybe the rhombus is not formed by points that are rotated by 90 degrees, but by some other symmetry.\n\nWait, another approach: since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and are perpendicular, let's denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Let\u2019s assume that AC is along the x-axis and BD is along the y-axis. So, points A and C are on the x-axis, and points B and D are on the y-axis.\n\nWait, but in that case, all four points would be (p, 0), (-p, 0), (0, q), (0, -q). But then, connecting these points would form a kite, not a rhombus, unless p = q. Because in a kite, two pairs of adjacent sides are equal, but all four sides are equal only if it's a rhombus.\n\nSo, if p = q, then the figure is a rhombus. So, if we have points (p, 0), (-p, 0), (0, p), (0, -p), then all sides are equal: the distance between (p, 0) and (0, p) is sqrt(p\u00b2 + p\u00b2) = p*sqrt(2). Similarly, all sides are equal, so it's a rhombus.\n\nBut in this case, the points (p, 0) and (0, p) must lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, plugging (p, 0) into the hyperbola: p\u00b2/20 - 0 = 1 \u21d2 p\u00b2 = 20 \u21d2 p = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). Similarly, plugging (0, p) into the hyperbola: 0 - p\u00b2/24 = 1 \u21d2 -p\u00b2/24 = 1 \u21d2 p\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible. So, that can't be.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the rhombus cannot have its diagonals along the coordinate axes because the points on the y-axis would not satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, my initial assumption must be wrong. The diagonals cannot be along the coordinate axes because one of the points would have to be on the y-axis, which isn't possible for this hyperbola. So, the diagonals must be along some other lines, not the coordinate axes.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the diagonals are along lines with some slope, not zero or infinity.\n\nLet me consider that the diagonals are along lines y = m x and y = -m x, where m is some slope. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1, so if one has slope m, the other has slope -1/m.\n\nWait, but if the diagonals are along y = m x and y = -1/m x, then they are perpendicular. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to these two lines.\n\nSo, the four vertices of the rhombus can be written as (a, b), (-a, -b), (-b, a), (b, -a), similar to before, but perhaps with a different scaling.\n\nWait, but in this case, the points (a, b) and (-a, -b) are on one diagonal, and (-b, a) and (b, -a) are on the other diagonal.\n\nSo, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, plugging (a, b) into x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 gives a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSimilarly, plugging (-b, a) into the hyperbola equation gives (-b)^2 /20 - (a)^2 /24 =1 \u21d2 b\u00b2/20 - a\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, again, we have the same two equations as before:\n\n(1) a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1\n\n(2) b\u00b2/20 - a\u00b2/24 =1\n\nWhich led to the impossible result when adding. So, perhaps my parametrization is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the diagonals are not along y = m x and y = -1/m x. Maybe they are along arbitrary lines through the origin, but not necessarily with slopes m and -1/m.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, their slopes must multiply to -1. So, if one diagonal has slope m, the other must have slope -1/m.\n\nSo, let me consider that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the two diagonals as AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, and perpendicular to each other.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that points A and C are on diagonal AC, and points B and D are on diagonal BD.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nLet\u2019s parameterize the points on the diagonals.\n\nLet\u2019s let the diagonal AC have direction vector (p, q), and BD have direction vector (r, s), such that p*r + q*s =0 (since they are perpendicular). But since both diagonals pass through the origin, points A and C are scalar multiples of (p, q), and points B and D are scalar multiples of (r, s).\n\nBut all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, let me denote points A as t*(p, q), C as -t*(p, q), B as s*(r, s), D as -s*(r, s), where t and s are positive real numbers.\n\nSince A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nFor point A: (t p)^2 /20 - (t q)^2 /24 =1 \u21d2 t\u00b2 (p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24) =1\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (s r)^2 /20 - (s s)^2 /24 =1 \u21d2 s\u00b2 (r\u00b2 /20 - s\u00b2 /24) =1\n\nBut wait, we have two different equations here for t and s, but the same hyperbola. Also, since the diagonals are perpendicular, we have p*r + q*s =0.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should instead use a different parametrization.\n\nLet me denote the diagonals as lines through the origin with slopes m and -1/m.\n\nSo, one diagonal is y = m x, the other is y = (-1/m) x.\n\nSo, the points on the first diagonal are (a, m a) and (-a, -m a), and the points on the second diagonal are (b, (-1/m) b) and (-b, (1/m) b).\n\nSo, all four points: (a, m a), (-a, -m a), (b, (-1/m) b), (-b, (1/m) b).\n\nThese four points must lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, plugging in (a, m a):\n\na\u00b2 /20 - (m\u00b2 a\u00b2)/24 =1 \u21d2 a\u00b2 (1/20 - m\u00b2 /24) =1.\n\nSimilarly, plugging in (b, (-1/m) b):\n\nb\u00b2 /20 - ( (1/m\u00b2) b\u00b2 ) /24 =1 \u21d2 b\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) )=1.\n\nSo, from point A, we have:\n\na\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2 /24 )\n\nSimilarly, from point B:\n\nb\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) )\n\nNow, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. So, AC has length 2a (from (a, m a) to (-a, -m a)), and BD has length 2b (from (b, (-1/m) b) to (-b, (1/m) b)).\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the lengths of the diagonals can vary, but the sides are equal.\n\nWait, but in our case, the sides are formed by the distances between consecutive points. So, the distance between (a, m a) and (b, (-1/m) b) must be equal to the distance between (b, (-1/m) b) and (-a, -m a), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider the properties of a rhombus.\n\nIn a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nSo, the sides can be calculated as half the length of the diagonals, but wait, no. Wait, the sides are equal, so the distance between (a, m a) and (b, (-1/m) b) should equal the distance between (b, (-1/m) b) and (-a, -m a), etc.\n\nSo, let me compute the distance between (a, m a) and (b, (-1/m) b):\n\nDistance squared: (a - b)^2 + (m a + (1/m) b)^2.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between (b, (-1/m) b) and (-a, -m a):\n\nDistance squared: (b + a)^2 + ( (-1/m) b + m a )^2.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, these distances must be equal.\n\nSo, set them equal:\n\n(a - b)^2 + (m a + (1/m) b)^2 = (a + b)^2 + ( (-1/m) b + m a )^2\n\nWait, let me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: (a - b)^2 + (m a + (1/m) b)^2\n\nRight side: (a + b)^2 + ( (-1/m) b + m a )^2\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nLeft side:\n\n(a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2\n\n(m a + (1/m) b)^2 = m\u00b2 a\u00b2 + 2*(m a)*(1/m b) + (1/m\u00b2) b\u00b2 = m\u00b2 a\u00b2 + 2ab + (1/m\u00b2) b\u00b2\n\nSo, left side total: a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2 + m\u00b2 a\u00b2 + 2ab + (1/m\u00b2) b\u00b2 = (1 + m\u00b2) a\u00b2 + (1 + 1/m\u00b2) b\u00b2\n\nRight side:\n\n(a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2\n\n( (-1/m) b + m a )^2 = (m a - (1/m) b)^2 = m\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 2ab + (1/m\u00b2) b\u00b2\n\nSo, right side total: a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 + m\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 2ab + (1/m\u00b2) b\u00b2 = (1 + m\u00b2) a\u00b2 + (1 + 1/m\u00b2) b\u00b2\n\nSo, both sides are equal. So, this condition doesn't give us any new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need another condition.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors along the diagonals should be perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.\n\nWait, but in our parametrization, the diagonals are along (a, m a) and (b, (-1/m) b). So, vectors AC and BD are (2a, 2m a) and (2b, (-2/m) b). Wait, no, actually, the vectors from the origin to the vertices are (a, m a) and (b, (-1/m) b). So, the vectors along the diagonals are (a - (-a), m a - (-m a)) = (2a, 2m a) and (b - (-b), (-1/m b) - (1/m b)) = (2b, (-2/m) b).\n\nSo, the dot product of these two vectors should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (2a)(2b) + (2m a)( (-2/m) b ) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n4ab + (2m a)(-2b/m) = 4ab -4ab = 0.\n\nWhich is always zero, so that condition is automatically satisfied. So, that doesn't help us find a relation between a and b.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nLet me recall that in a rhombus, the area can be expressed as (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, the area can be expressed as side\u00b2 * sin(theta), where theta is one of the internal angles.\n\nBut perhaps that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, but since all four points lie on the hyperbola, and we have expressions for a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 in terms of m, perhaps I can relate them.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\na\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2 /24 )\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) )\n\nLet me denote m\u00b2 as k, so k >0.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - k /24 )\n\nAnd b\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 k) )\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 1 / [ (24 - 20k) / (24*20) ) ] = 24*20 / (24 - 20k) = 480 / (24 -20k )\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2 = 1 / [ (24k -20 ) / (24*20 k ) ] = 24*20 k / (24k -20 ) = 480k / (24k -20 )\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 480 / (24 -20k )\n\nb\u00b2 = 480k / (24k -20 )\n\nNote that denominators must be positive because a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 are positive.\n\nSo, 24 -20k >0 \u21d2 k < 24/20 = 6/5 =1.2\n\nSimilarly, 24k -20 >0 \u21d2 k >20/24=5/6\u22480.8333\n\nSo, k must be between 5/6 and 6/5.\n\nSo, k \u2208 (5/6, 6/5 )\n\nNow, the diagonals are AC and BD, with lengths 2a and 2b respectively.\n\nSo, AC\u00b2 = (2a)^2 =4a\u00b2=4*(480)/(24-20k)=1920/(24-20k )\n\nSimilarly, BD\u00b2= (2b)^2=4b\u00b2=4*(480k)/(24k -20 )= 1920k/(24k -20 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= 1920k/(24k -20 )\n\nWe can write this as BD\u00b2= (1920k)/(24k -20 )\n\nLet me denote this as BD\u00b2= f(k)=1920k/(24k -20 )\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, since we are looking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, which would be the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, to find the minimal value of f(k) for k \u2208 (5/6, 6/5 )\n\nWe can treat this as a calculus problem: find the minimum of f(k) in the interval (5/6, 6/5 )\n\nFirst, let's compute f(k):\n\nf(k) = 1920k/(24k -20 )\n\nLet me simplify f(k):\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\n1920k / (24k -20 ) = (1920/24) *k/(k - 20/24 )= 80 *k/(k - 5/6 )\n\nSo, f(k)=80k/(k -5/6 )\n\nNow, let me compute the derivative of f(k) with respect to k to find minima or maxima.\n\nf'(k)= [80*(k -5/6 ) -80k*(1) ] / (k -5/6 )\u00b2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n80(k -5/6) -80k =80k -80*(5/6) -80k= -80*(5/6 )= -400/6 = -200/3\n\nSo, f'(k)= (-200/3 ) / (k -5/6 )\u00b2\n\nSince (k -5/6 )\u00b2 is always positive for k \u22605/6, and our domain is k>5/6, so denominator is positive. Thus, f'(k) is negative throughout the interval (5/6, 6/5 )\n\nSo, f(k) is decreasing on (5/6, 6/5 )\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(k) occurs at the right endpoint, which is k=6/5.\n\nWait, but wait. If f(k) is decreasing on the interval, then as k increases, f(k) decreases. So, the minimal value would be at the maximum k, which is 6/5.\n\nWait, let me compute f(k) at k approaching 5/6 from the right and at k=6/5.\n\nFirst, as k approaches 5/6 from above, denominator (k -5/6 ) approaches 0 from positive side, so f(k)=80k/(k -5/6 ) approaches +infinity.\n\nAt k=6/5, f(k)=80*(6/5 )/(6/5 -5/6 )\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n6/5 -5/6 = (36 -25)/30=11/30\n\nSo, f(k)=80*(6/5 )/(11/30 )=80*(6/5 )*(30/11 )=80*(6*6)/11=80*36/11=2880/11\u2248261.818\n\nWait, but let me compute that step by step.\n\nWait, 80*(6/5 )= (80/5)*6=16*6=96\n\nThen, 96 divided by (11/30 )=96*(30/11 )= (96*30)/11=2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nSo, f(k) at k=6/5 is 2880/11.\n\nBut since f(k) is decreasing on the interval, the minimal value is 2880/11, and the maximal value is approaching infinity as k approaches 5/6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, but we need the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all rhombuses. Because if the infimum is m, then m is the greatest lower bound; any number less than m is also a lower bound, but m is the greatest.\n\nBut in our case, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large by taking k approaching 5/6 from above, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity. So, the infimum would be the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but wait, as k increases from 5/6 to 6/5, BD\u00b2 decreases from infinity to 2880/11. So, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 2880/11, but can be larger.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 2880/11, and BD\u00b2 can be any value greater than or equal to 2880/11.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 2880/11, and larger, the number we're looking for is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 2880/11, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u22652880/11. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 2880/11, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to that.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 2880/11, then 2880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=2880/11, the number would be equal, not less. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be the supremum of the lower bounds, which is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 2880/11, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, perhaps the answer is 2880/11, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2. Because if m is less than the minimal BD\u00b2, then it's less than all BD\u00b2. If m is equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=m, m is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2. Therefore, the greatest such m is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 2880/11. Because BD\u00b2 can approach 2880/11 from above, but cannot be less than that. So, the greatest m is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but wait, in our calculation, BD\u00b2 at k=6/5 is exactly 2880/11, so for that rhombus, BD\u00b2=2880/11. So, the number m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, including this one. So, m must be less than 2880/11. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if m is the greatest such number, then m must be 2880/11, because for any number greater than 2880/11, there exists a rhombus (the one with BD\u00b2=2880/11) where m is not less than BD\u00b2. So, the greatest m is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because 2880/11 is achieved by a rhombus, so m must be less than 2880/11. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum, which is 2880/11, and since it's achievable, the greatest number less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 2880/11. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" so perhaps m must be strictly less than 2880/11. But then, the greatest such m would be approaching 2880/11 from below, but since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 2880/11, m cannot be 2880/11. So, the answer would be 2880/11, but expressed as the limit.\n\nWait, but 2880/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 2880/11, but no smaller. So, any number less than 2880/11 would not be a lower bound for all BD\u00b2, because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=2880/11, that number would be less than BD\u00b2. But the problem is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, the number must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 2880/11. Therefore, the greatest such number is 2880/11, because for any number greater than 2880/11, there exists a rhombus (the one with BD\u00b2=2880/11) where the number is not less than BD\u00b2. So, the answer is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWe had f(k) = 80k/(k -5/6 )\n\nWe found that f(k) is decreasing on (5/6, 6/5 ), so its minimal value is at k=6/5, which is 2880/11.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 2880/11, and as large as infinity. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 2880/11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is m=2880/11, because for any m' >2880/11, there exists a rhombus (the one with BD\u00b2=2880/11) where m' is not less than BD\u00b2. Therefore, the greatest m is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but wait again. If m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, including the one with BD\u00b2=2880/11, then m must be less than 2880/11. But 2880/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, the greatest m less than all BD\u00b2 is 2880/11, because any m' >2880/11 would not satisfy m' < BD\u00b2 for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=2880/11. So, m=2880/11 is the answer.\n\nWait, but 2880/11 is exactly the minimal BD\u00b2, so m=2880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus, it's equal. So, perhaps the answer is 2880/11 minus some epsilon, but since we're looking for the greatest real number, it would be 2880/11.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is phrased in such a way that it allows m to be equal to the minimal BD\u00b2. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that BD\u00b2 can be exactly 2880/11. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWe found that when k=6/5, BD\u00b2=2880/11. So, that's a valid rhombus with BD\u00b2=2880/11. So, m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, including this one. Therefore, m must be less than 2880/11. But the problem is asking for the greatest such m. So, the answer would be 2880/11, because any number greater than that would fail for this rhombus. But since m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, m must be less than or equal to 2880/11. Wait, no. Because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=2880/11, m must be less than 2880/11. So, the greatest m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but the infimum is 2880/11, but it's achieved, so the infimum is actually the minimum. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 2880/11. Therefore, the greatest m is 2880/11, because for all rhombuses, BD\u00b2 \u22652880/11. So, m=2880/11 is the greatest number such that m \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, including the one with BD\u00b2=2880/11. Therefore, m must be less than 2880/11. So, the greatest such m is approaching 2880/11 from below, but since m must be a real number, the answer is 2880/11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the answer is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 2880/11, because for all rhombuses, BD\u00b2 \u22652880/11. So, 2880/11 is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, the answer is 2880/11.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2880/11, which is approximately 261.818. But since the problem asks for the integer answer, wait, no, the problem doesn't specify that. Wait, looking back: \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" It doesn't specify integer, but in the initial problem statement, the hyperbola has integer coefficients, so perhaps the answer is 2880/11, which is approximately 261.818. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, perhaps the answer is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. If BD\u00b2 can be as small as 2880/11, then any m less than or equal to 2880/11 would satisfy m \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if m is 2880/11, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=2880/11, m is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. Therefore, m must be less than 2880/11. So, the greatest such m is approaching 2880/11 from below. But since we can't have m equal to 2880/11, the answer is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, m must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. Therefore, m must be less than or equal to the infimum of BD\u00b2. But the infimum is achieved, so m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2. Therefore, the greatest m is the infimum, which is 2880/11. Because if m is less than 2880/11, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=2880/11, m is less than BD\u00b2, which is correct. But if m is equal to 2880/11, then for that rhombus, m is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. Therefore, the greatest m is 2880/11, because any m greater than that would fail for some rhombus, but m can be up to 2880/11. Wait, no. Because m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, including the one with BD\u00b2=2880/11. Therefore, m must be less than 2880/11. So, the greatest m is approaching 2880/11 from below, but in terms of exact value, it's 2880/11. So, the answer is 2880/11.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just accept that the answer is 2880/11, which is 261 and 9/11, but in fractional terms, it's 2880/11. So, the final answer is 2880/11.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular, and the rhombus's vertices lie on the hyperbola. \n\nWe parameterize the diagonals along lines \\( y = mx \\) and \\( y = -\\frac{1}{m}x \\), with vertices at \\( (a, ma) \\), \\( (-a, -ma) \\), \\( (b, -\\frac{1}{m}b) \\), and \\( (-b, \\frac{1}{m}b) \\). Substituting these points into the hyperbola equation, we derive expressions for \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) in terms of \\( m^2 \\), leading to the function \\( BD^2 = \\frac{1920k}{24k - 20} \\) where \\( k = m^2 \\).\n\nAnalyzing \\( BD^2 \\) as a function of \\( k \\) over the interval \\( \\frac{5}{6} < k < \\frac{6}{5} \\), we find that \\( BD^2 \\) is minimized at \\( k = \\frac{6}{5} \\), yielding \\( BD^2 = \\frac{2880}{11} \\). Since \\( BD^2 \\) can be as small as \\( \\frac{2880}{11} \\), the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi is \\( \\boxed{\\dfrac{2880}{11}} \\).",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. \n\nFirst, the hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. I remember that the standard form of a hyperbola is x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, which opens left and right. So here, a\u00b2 is 20 and b\u00b2 is 24. That means a is sqrt(20) and b is sqrt(24). Simplifying, a is 2*sqrt(5) and b is 2*sqrt(6). \n\nThe points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint for both diagonals. That means if one point is (x, y), the opposite point will be (-x, -y). So, points are symmetric about the origin.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. But in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the rhombus is centered at the origin.\n\nI need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and we're looking for the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD\u00b2. Alternatively, the maximum possible BD\u00b2 might be unbounded, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Maybe it's the infimum of the upper bounds? Or perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 possible? I think I need to clarify.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of BD\u00b2, but since BD\u00b2 could be as large as possible, maybe it's looking for a lower bound? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me read it again: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the largest number that is a lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2? Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least this number. So, the maximum lower bound.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. If I have a number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then the greatest such number would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, the problem is asking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest number that is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2 given that ABCD is a rhombus on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's denote the points. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are arranged such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parametrize the points. Let me suppose that points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, so if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D are (-u, -v) and (u, v), respectively.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if the origin is the midpoint, then if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). So, points are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nLet me write down the coordinates:\n\nA = (x, y)\nB = (p, q)\nC = (-x, -y)\nD = (-p, -q)\n\nSo, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nCompute AB: distance between (x,y) and (p,q). Which is sqrt[(x-p)^2 + (y - q)^2].\n\nSimilarly, BC: distance between (p,q) and (-x,-y). That's sqrt[(p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2].\n\nSince it's a rhombus, AB = BC.\n\nSo, setting AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2:\n\n(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: x\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2\nRight: p\u00b2 + 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2yq + y\u00b2\n\nSet equal:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2yq + y\u00b2\n\nSimplify by subtracting x\u00b2, y\u00b2, p\u00b2, q\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2xp - 2yq = 2xp + 2yq\n\nMove all terms to left:\n\n-2xp - 2yq - 2xp - 2yq = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-4xp -4yq = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nxp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is xp + yq = 0.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute other sides, but perhaps this is sufficient for now.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, each point must satisfy this equation. So, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, similarly for B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd from the rhombus condition: xp + yq = 0.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of the diagonal BD. Let's compute BD.\n\nPoints B and D are (p, q) and (-p, -q). So, the distance between them is sqrt[(p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2p)\u00b2 + (2q)^2] = sqrt(4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nOur aim is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, find the infimum of BD\u00b2. Wait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds for BD\u00b2.\n\nBut BD\u00b2 is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, we need to find the minimum possible value of p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 given the constraints.\n\nWait, but wait: the rhombus must have all sides equal, so we have the condition xp + yq = 0. So, we need to find the minimum of p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 subject to p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1, and xp + yq =0, and x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points on the hyperbola using hyperbola parametric equations. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Alternatively, using hyperbolic functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). Let me choose the hyperbolic parametrization because it might be easier.\n\nSo, let\u2019s set point A as (a cosh t, b sinh t), where a\u00b2=20 and b\u00b2=24. So, a = sqrt(20), b = sqrt(24).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (a cosh s, b sinh s). But we need to relate these points such that the diagonals intersect at the origin and the figure is a rhombus.\n\nWait, but in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD. Since A is (a cosh t, b sinh t), then C is (-a cosh t, -b sinh t). Similarly, B is (a cosh s, b sinh s), and D is (-a cosh s, -b sinh s).\n\nBut then, the diagonals are AC and BD. The midpoint is the origin, which is given.\n\nBut for it to be a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nBut let's compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nPoint A: (a cosh t, b sinh t)\nPoint B: (a cosh s, b sinh s)\n\nAB\u00b2 = [a cosh t - a cosh s]^2 + [b sinh t - b sinh s]^2\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2 = [a cosh s - (-a cosh t)]^2 + [b sinh s - (-b sinh t)]^2\n\nWhich is [a (cosh s + cosh t)]\u00b2 + [b (sinh s + sinh t)]\u00b2\n\nSet AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2:\n\n[a (cosh t - cosh s)]\u00b2 + [b (sinh t - sinh s)]\u00b2 = [a (cosh s + cosh t)]\u00b2 + [b (sinh s + sinh t)]\u00b2\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 (cosh t - cosh s)^2 + b\u00b2 (sinh t - sinh s)^2\n\nRight side: a\u00b2 (cosh t + cosh s)^2 + b\u00b2 (sinh t + sinh s)^2\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\na\u00b2 [(cosh t + cosh s)^2 - (cosh t - cosh s)^2] + b\u00b2 [(sinh t + sinh s)^2 - (sinh t - sinh s)^2] = 0\n\nCompute each difference:\n\nFor cosh terms: (A+B)^2 - (A-B)^2 = 4AB\n\nSimilarly for sinh terms: same.\n\nSo:\n\na\u00b2 * 4 cosh t cosh s + b\u00b2 * 4 sinh t sinh s = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 cosh t cosh s + b\u00b2 sinh t sinh s = 0\n\nSo, the equation is a\u00b2 cosh t cosh s + b\u00b2 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nBut a\u00b2 is 20, b\u00b2 is 24.\n\nSo:\n\n20 cosh t cosh s + 24 sinh t sinh s = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n20 cosh t cosh s = -24 sinh t sinh s\n\nDivide both sides by cosh t cosh s (assuming cosh t cosh s \u2260 0, which they aren't because cosh is always \u22651):\n\n20 = -24 (sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s) \n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n(sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s) = tanh t tanh s\n\nSo,\n\n20 = -24 tanh t tanh s\n\nWhich implies:\n\ntanh t tanh s = -20 / 24 = -5/6\n\nSo, tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, the product of tanh t and tanh s is -5/6.\n\nNow, since tanh is an odd function, and the product is negative, that means one of t or s is negative, but since t and s are real numbers, that's fine.\n\nLet me denote tanh t = u, tanh s = v. Then u*v = -5/6.\n\nBut we also have that u and v are hyperbolic tangents, so |u| < 1, |v| <1.\n\nSo, |u*v| \u2264 1, but here |u*v|=5/6 <1, so that's okay.\n\nNow, let's see if we can express this in terms of exponentials or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the identity for tanh(t + s) or something.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express u and v as tanh t and tanh s, and relate them.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach. Since we have tanh t * tanh s = -5/6.\n\nWe can write this as (sinh t / cosh t) * (sinh s / cosh s) = -5/6.\n\nBut maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since hyperbolic functions can be expressed in terms of exponentials.\n\nLet me recall that tanh t = (e^t - e^{-t})/(e^t + e^{-t}) = (e^{2t} -1)/(e^{2t} +1).\n\nSimilarly for tanh s.\n\nSo, let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set u = e^{2t}, so tanh t = (u - 1)/(u + 1).\n\nSimilarly, let\u2019s set v = e^{2s}, so tanh s = (v -1)/(v +1).\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n[(u -1)/(u +1)] * [(v -1)/(v +1)] = -5/6\n\nSo,\n\n(u -1)(v -1) / [(u +1)(v +1)] = -5/6\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n6(u -1)(v -1) = -5(u +1)(v +1)\n\nExpand both sides:\n\n6(uv - u - v +1) = -5(uv + u + v +1)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n6uv -6u -6v +6 +5uv +5u +5v +5 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(6uv +5uv) + (-6u +5u) + (-6v +5v) + (6+5) =0\n\n11uv -u -v +11 =0\n\nSo,\n\n11uv -u -v +11=0\n\nHmm, that's a diophantine-like equation but in u and v.\n\nWait, maybe we can rearrange this:\n\n11uv -u -v = -11\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n11uv -u -v +1 = -10\n\nFactor:\n\n(11uv -u -v +1) = -10\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\nLet me factor u terms:\n\nu(11v -1) -v +1 = -10\n\nNot sure if helpful. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of u:\n\n11uv -u -v = -11\n\nu(11v -1) = v -11\n\nSo,\n\nu = (v -11)/(11v -1)\n\nSimilarly, since u and v are positive real numbers (because exponentials are positive), we can write:\n\nu = (v -11)/(11v -1)\n\nWe need u >0 and v >0.\n\nSo, let's consider the numerator and denominator:\n\n(v -11) and (11v -1).\n\nCase 1: Both numerator and denominator positive.\n\nSo,\n\nv -11 >0 => v>11\n\n11v -1>0 => v>1/11\n\nSo, if v>11, then u is positive.\n\nCase 2: Both numerator and denominator negative.\n\nv -11 <0 => v<11\n\n11v -1 <0 => v<1/11\n\nSo, if v<1/11, then u is positive.\n\nBut v must be positive, so in case 2, 0 <v<1/11.\n\nSo, in both cases, u is positive.\n\nBut u = e^{2t} >0, same for v.\n\nSo, we can have two scenarios: v>11 or v<1/11.\n\nBut let's think about how this affects t and s.\n\nIf v = e^{2s} >11, then s is large positive.\n\nSimilarly, if v <1/11, then s is large negative.\n\nBut in either case, we can proceed.\n\nNow, our aim is to find BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). But p and q are the coordinates of point B, which is (a cosh s, b sinh s). So, p = a cosh s, q = b sinh s.\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4(a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 s)\n\nSimilarly, for point A: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t.\n\nWe have the equation tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nAlternatively, using u and v:\n\ntanh t = (u-1)/(u+1), tanh s = (v -1)/(v+1), and u*v = (v -11)/(11v -1) * v = (v -11)/ (11v -1) * v = (v\u00b2 -11v)/(11v -1)\n\nWait, perhaps that's complicating things. Maybe I should express BD\u00b2 in terms of s.\n\nBD\u00b2 =4(a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 s)\n\nWe can write this as 4( a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 s )\n\nLet me compute this expression:\n\nLet\u2019s factor out cosh\u00b2 s:\n\n4 cosh\u00b2 s (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 tanh\u00b2 s )\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's write BD\u00b2 as:\n\n4 [a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 s] =4 [ a\u00b2 (1 + sinh\u00b2 s) + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 s ] =4 [ a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) sinh\u00b2 s ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 a\u00b2 + 4 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of s, and we need to find its minimal value.\n\nBut since a and b are constants, and sinh\u00b2 s is always non-negative, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when sinh\u00b2 s is minimal. Since sinh\u00b2 s can be zero, but let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, sinh s =0 when s=0, but if s=0, then tanh s=0, so from tanh t tanh s = -5/6, we have 0 = -5/6, which is impossible. So, s cannot be zero.\n\nTherefore, sinh s cannot be zero. So, sinh\u00b2 s has a minimum value greater than zero.\n\nWait, but we can perhaps find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 given the constraint.\n\nBut I think another approach is needed. Since we have the condition tanh t tanh s = -5/6, and BD\u00b2 expressed in terms of s, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of tanh s or something.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of t and s.\n\nWe have tanh t * tanh s = -5/6.\n\nLet me denote k = tanh t, m = tanh s.\n\nSo, k * m = -5/6.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2 =4(a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 s).\n\nBut cosh\u00b2 s = 1/(1 - m\u00b2), and sinh\u00b2 s = m\u00b2/(1 - m\u00b2).\n\nWait, because cosh\u00b2 s - sinh\u00b2 s =1. So, if m = tanh s = sinh s / cosh s, then sinh s = m cosh s, and cosh\u00b2 s = 1/(1 - m\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 [ a\u00b2 * (1/(1 - m\u00b2)) + b\u00b2 * (m\u00b2/(1 - m\u00b2)) ]\n\n=4 [ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 m\u00b2) / (1 - m\u00b2) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 m\u00b2)/(1 - m\u00b2)\n\nBut we know that k * m = -5/6, and k = tanh t.\n\nBut tanh t = (e^{2t} -1)/(e^{2t} +1) = (u -1)/(u +1), where u = e^{2t}.\n\nWait, but earlier, we have u = (v -11)/(11v -1), where v = e^{2s}.\n\nBut maybe I can express k in terms of m.\n\nWait, k = tanh t, m = tanh s, and k * m = -5/6.\n\nSo, k = (-5)/(6 m).\n\nBut k = tanh t, which must satisfy |k| <1.\n\nSo,\n\n| (-5)/(6 m) | <1\n\nWhich implies |5/(6 m)| <1 => |m| >5/6.\n\nSo, |m| >5/6.\n\nSince m = tanh s, which is between -1 and 1, but not including \u00b11.\n\nSo, m must satisfy |m| >5/6, i.e., m>5/6 or m < -5/6.\n\nBut since in our case, k*m = -5/6, and k = tanh t.\n\nIf m>5/6, then k must be negative because k*m is negative.\n\nSimilarly, if m < -5/6, then k must be positive.\n\nSo, in either case, m is outside (-5/6, 5/6).\n\nBut given that, we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of m:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 m\u00b2)/(1 - m\u00b2)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 [ a\u00b2 (1 - m\u00b2) + a\u00b2 m\u00b2 + b\u00b2 m\u00b2 ] / (1 - m\u00b2)\n\nWait, that might not help. Alternatively, let me write it as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 [ a\u00b2 + (b\u00b2 - a\u00b2) m\u00b2 ] / (1 - m\u00b2 )\n\nBut a\u00b2 is 20, b\u00b2 is24, so b\u00b2 -a\u00b2=4.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 [20 +4 m\u00b2 ] / (1 - m\u00b2 )\n\n=4 * [20 +4 m\u00b2]/(1 - m\u00b2)\n\n=4 * [4(m\u00b2 +5)] / (1 - m\u00b2)\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, 20 +4 m\u00b2 is 4*(5) +4 m\u00b2 =4(m\u00b2 +5). Wait, 20 is 4*5, so 20 +4 m\u00b2 =4(5 +m\u00b2). So,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [4(5 + m\u00b2)]/(1 - m\u00b2)\n\n=16*(5 + m\u00b2)/(1 - m\u00b2)\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =16*(5 + m\u00b2)/(1 - m\u00b2)\n\nNow, our aim is to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, given that |m|>5/6.\n\nSo, m is either greater than 5/6 or less than -5/6.\n\nBut since m\u00b2 is same for m and -m, we can assume m>5/6 and find the minimal value.\n\nSo, let's consider m>5/6.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2 as a function of m:\n\nBD\u00b2(m) =16*(5 + m\u00b2)/(1 - m\u00b2)\n\nWe need to find the minimum of this function for m>5/6.\n\nTo find the minimum, take derivative with respect to m, set to zero.\n\nBut let's compute BD\u00b2(m):\n\nBD\u00b2(m) =16*(5 + m\u00b2)/(1 - m\u00b2) =16*(m\u00b2 +5)/( - (m\u00b2 -1)) = -16*(m\u00b2 +5)/(m\u00b2 -1)\n\nBut since m>5/6, m\u00b2 -1 is negative when m\u00b2 <1, which is when m <1. So, for m in (5/6, 1), m\u00b2 -1 is negative, making BD\u00b2 positive.\n\nFor m>1, m\u00b2 -1 is positive, so BD\u00b2 would be negative, but BD\u00b2 is a square, so it must be positive. Therefore, m cannot be greater than1 because that would make BD\u00b2 negative, which is impossible.\n\nSo, m must be in (5/6, 1).\n\nSo, the domain is m \u2208 (5/6, 1).\n\nNow, let's compute the derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to m.\n\nLet me denote f(m) = (m\u00b2 +5)/(1 - m\u00b2)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =16 f(m)\n\nCompute f'(m):\n\nf'(m) = [ (2m)(1 - m\u00b2) - (m\u00b2 +5)(-2m) ] / (1 - m\u00b2)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2m(1 - m\u00b2) + 2m(m\u00b2 +5) = 2m [ (1 - m\u00b2) + (m\u00b2 +5) ] =2m [1 -m\u00b2 +m\u00b2 +5] =2m*(6) =12m\n\nSo,\n\nf'(m) =12m / (1 - m\u00b2)^2\n\nSince m>5/6, which is positive, and denominator is positive (since 1 - m\u00b2 is negative, squared is positive), so f'(m) is positive.\n\nTherefore, f(m) is increasing on (5/6,1). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is increasing on (5/6,1).\n\nThus, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs at the left endpoint, m=5/6.\n\nSo, plug m=5/6 into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2=16*(5 + (25/36))/(1 -25/36)\n\nCompute numerator:5 +25/36 = (180 +25)/36=205/36\n\nDenominator:1 -25/36=11/36\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=16*(205/36)/(11/36)=16*(205/36)*(36/11)=16*205/11= (3280)/11 \u2248 298.1818...\n\nWait, but is that the minimal BD\u00b2? Wait, since BD\u00b2 is increasing for m>5/6, then the minimal BD\u00b2 is achieved at m=5/6, giving BD\u00b2= (16*(5 + (25/36)))/(1 -25/36)= as above.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation.\n\nNumerator:5 + (25/36) = (180 +25)/36=205/36.\n\nDenominator:1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo, (205/36)/(11/36)=205/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=16*(205/11)= (16*205)/11=3280/11.\n\n3280 divided by 11: 11*298= 3278, so 3280=11*298 +2, so 3280/11=298 +2/11\u2248298.1818...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 3280/11.\n\nBut wait, is this the minimal BD\u00b2? Because when m approaches 1 from below, BD\u00b2 tends to infinity. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is at m=5/6, giving BD\u00b2=3280/11.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Since m must be greater than5/6, but less than1. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is at m=5/6, which is the lower bound.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is minimized when m=5/6, giving BD\u00b2=3280/11\u2248298.1818.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 3280/11, which is approximately298.1818. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 3280/11, but since BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to this, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum itself, because BD\u00b2 can get as close as we like to 3280/11, but not less.\n\nWait, but no. Because the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, this number should be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. So, the infimum is the minimal BD\u00b2, so any number less than the infimum would not satisfy the condition. Wait, no.\n\nWait, the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, if the infimum is 3280/11, then for any number less than 3280/11, say 3280/11 - \u03b5, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that, which contradicts. So, actually, the infimum is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum itself, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to the infimum, but not less. Wait, but in reality, can BD\u00b2 actually achieve the infimum?\n\nWait, when m approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 3280/11. But when m=5/6, tanh s=5/6, but then tanh t= (-5/6)/(5/6)= -1.\n\nBut tanh t= -1 implies t approaches -infinity. So, point A would be (a cosh t, b sinh t) with t approaching -infinity. But cosh t approaches infinity as t approaches -infty, so point A would go to infinity, which is not possible on the hyperbola. Wait, but hyperbola extends to infinity, so perhaps it's allowed.\n\nWait, but if t approaches -infty, then cosh t approaches infinity, so point A would be very far away. Similarly, point B would be with s such that tanh s=5/6, which is a finite value, so point B is finite.\n\nBut in that case, the rhombus would have one vertex at infinity and the others finite, which might not be a proper rhombus. Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot actually reach 3280/11, but can approach it as the rhombus becomes very \"stretched.\" So, the infimum is 3280/11, but it's not attainable, so BD\u00b2 is always greater than 3280/11.\n\nBut then the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum, 3280/11, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to that number. Wait, but if the infimum is the minimal value, then BD\u00b2 is always \u2265 infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum, because for any number greater than the infimum, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number. So, the infimum is the maximum lower bound.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to the infimum, the supremum of such numbers is the infimum itself.\n\nWait, for example, suppose BD\u00b2 can take any value \u2265 L (L being the infimum). Then, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is L, because for any \u03b5>0, there's a rhombus with BD\u00b2 = L + \u03b5, so L is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but any number larger than L would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nSo, the answer is L=3280/11.\n\nBut let me verify the calculations again.\n\nWe had:\n\nBD\u00b2=16*(5 + m\u00b2)/(1 - m\u00b2)\n\nAt m=5/6:\n\nm\u00b2=25/36.\n\nSo,\n\n5 + m\u00b2=5 +25/36= (180 +25)/36=205/36.\n\n1 - m\u00b2=1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo,\n\n(5 + m\u00b2)/(1 -m\u00b2)= (205/36)/(11/36)=205/11.\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2=16*(205/11)=3280/11\u2248298.1818.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 3280/11, which is approximately298.18.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 3280/11.\n\nBut wait, 3280 divided by 11: 11*298=3278, so 3280/11=298 + 2/11=298.1818...\n\nSo, the answer is 3280/11, which is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 3280/11.\n\nWait, but let me check: if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 3280/11, then any number less than that would not be a lower bound for all rhombi because there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=3280/11. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 3280/11 itself, since BD\u00b2 is always \u22653280/11.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the set of numbers that are less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 3280/11, any number less than 3280/11 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, except for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=3280/11.\n\nWait, no, if there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2=3280/11, then any number greater than 3280/11 would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for that rhombus, BD\u00b2=3280/11, so numbers greater than that would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut numbers less than 3280/11 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi except for the one where BD\u00b2=3280/11. Wait, no. Because for that rhombus, BD\u00b2=3280/11, so numbers less than that would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including that one.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. If a number is less than 3280/11, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=3280/11, the number is less than BD\u00b2. So, the number is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the one where BD\u00b2=3280/11.\n\nBut if we take a number greater than 3280/11, say 3280/11 + \u03b5, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=3280/11, the number is greater than BD\u00b2, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 3280/11.\n\nSo, the answer is 3280/11, which is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if 3280/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2, then any number less than 3280/11 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the greatest such number is 3280/11 itself, because for any number greater than that, it's not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, no. If the number is 3280/11, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=3280/11, the number is equal to BD\u00b2, which doesn't satisfy \"less than.\" So, actually, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the one where BD\u00b2 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the greatest such number is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 3280/11, but since BD\u00b2 can actually be equal to 3280/11, the number must be less than that. So, the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum, but since the infimum is attainable, the supremum is just below 3280/11.\n\nWait, but in real numbers, the supremum is 3280/11, because you can approach it as close as you like from above.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently.\n\nThe set of numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the intersection of all intervals (-infty, BD\u00b2) for each rhombus. The supremum of this set is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all rhombi.\n\nBecause for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < infimum + \u03b5. So, the supremum of the set is the infimum.\n\nBut in our case, the infimum is 3280/11, which is attainable. So, the set of numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is (-infty, 3280/11), because for any number less than 3280/11, it's less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the one with BD\u00b2=3280/11.\n\nWait, no. If a number is less than 3280/11, then it's less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because BD\u00b2 is at least 3280/11.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the set of numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is (-infty, 3280/11], because 3280/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 3280/11, because any number less than that would not be the greatest. Wait, no, 3280/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi are all numbers less than or equal to 3280/11. So, the greatest such number is 3280/11.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of it as the numbers that are less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. So, the intersection of all (-infty, BD\u00b2(rhombus)] is (-infty, inf BD\u00b2]. So, the greatest number in this intersection is inf BD\u00b2.\n\nBut inf BD\u00b2 is 3280/11, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 3280/11.\n\nBut wait, if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 3280/11, then 3280/11 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so it can't be equal to the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 3280/11, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 3280/11, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is just below 3280/11. But in real numbers, there's no such number; the supremum is 3280/11.\n\nSo, the answer is 3280/11, which is approximately298.1818.\n\nWait, but let me check: is BD\u00b2 allowed to be exactly 3280/11? If m=5/6, then tanh s=5/6, which is allowed. So, point B would be (a cosh s, b sinh s), which is a valid point on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the rhombus exists with BD\u00b2=3280/11. Therefore, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including this one. So, the number must be less than 3280/11. Therefore, the greatest such number is just less than 3280/11, but since we're dealing with real numbers, the supremum is 3280/11.\n\nBut the problem asks for \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 3280/11.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the infimum is 3280/11, then for any \u03b5>0, there's a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < 3280/11 + \u03b5. So, the set of numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is (-infty, 3280/11]. Because for any x \u22643280/11, x < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 \u22653280/11.\n\nWait, no. If x is equal to 3280/11, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=3280/11, x is not less than BD\u00b2. So, x must be strictly less than 3280/11.\n\nTherefore, the set is (-infty, 3280/11). The supremum of this set is 3280/11, but it's not included.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 3280/11.\n\nBut since 3280/11 is the infimum, and the set is (-infty, 3280/11), the supremum is 3280/11, even though it's not included.\n\nSo, the answer is 3280/11.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3280}{11}}.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The goal is to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Hyperbola Parameters**: The hyperbola equation is \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), where \\(a^2 = 20\\) and \\(b^2 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Rhombus Properties**: The diagonals of the rhombus bisect each other at the origin. Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are \\((x, y)\\), \\((p, q)\\), \\((-x, -y)\\), and \\((-p, -q)\\) respectively.\n\n3. **Condition for Rhombus**: The distances between consecutive points must be equal. This leads to the condition \\(xp + yq = 0\\).\n\n4. **Diagonal BD**: The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is calculated as \\(2\\sqrt{p^2 + q^2}\\), so \\(BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\\).\n\n5. **Hyperbola Constraints**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) satisfy the hyperbola equation, leading to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1\n   \\]\n\n6. **Parametrization**: Using hyperbolic functions, points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are parametrized as \\((a \\cosh t, b \\sinh t)\\) and \\((a \\cosh s, b \\sinh s)\\) respectively.\n\n7. **Tanh Condition**: The condition \\(xp + yq = 0\\) translates to \\(\\tanh t \\tanh s = -\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\n8. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**: Substituting the parametrization into \\(BD^2\\), we find:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4 \\left(20 + 4m^2\\right) / (1 - m^2)\n   \\]\n   where \\(m = \\tanh s\\).\n\n9. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**: The function is minimized when \\(m = \\frac{5}{6}\\), leading to:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = \\frac{3280}{11}\n   \\]\n\n10. **Conclusion**: The greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is the infimum of \\(BD^2\\), which is \\(\\frac{3280}{11}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{3280}{11}}\n\\]",
