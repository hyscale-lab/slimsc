      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus is a bit like a donut with a big hole in the middle.\n\nNow, the sphere S has a radius of 11. The torus can rest on the inside of the sphere, meaning it's inside the sphere and touching it along a circle. Similarly, it can rest on the outside, touching the sphere externally along another circle. The problem is asking for the difference between the radii of these two circles, r_i and r_o, and then to express this difference as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm. I remember that when two surfaces are tangent, their centers are aligned along the same line. For the sphere and torus, this probably means that the center of the sphere and the center of the generating circle of the torus lie on the same line, and the point of tangency is along that line.\n\nLet me recall the properties of a torus. A torus can be described using two radii: R, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation (which is 6 in this case), and r, the radius of the generating circle itself (which is 3 here). So, this gives the major and minor radii of the torus.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is outside the torus, right? Wait, no. If the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center would coincide with the torus's center, perhaps? Or maybe not, because the torus is a surface, not a solid.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the distances. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is inside. The point of tangency would be the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere. Similarly, when it's outside, the point of tangency would be the farthest point on the torus from the center of the sphere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the torus mathematically. The equation of a torus can be written in 3D coordinates. Let me recall that. If the torus has major radius R (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and minor radius r (radius of the tube), then the equation in cylindrical coordinates is (R - sqrt(x^2 + y^2))^2 + z^2 = r^2.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think geometrically. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere touches the inner part of the torus. So the distance from the sphere's center to the center of the torus's tube must be such that the sphere's radius minus this distance equals the minor radius of the torus. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere's center is at the same point as the torus's \"center\", which is the center of the generating circle. Because when the torus is placed inside the sphere, it's symmetric. So, the point of tangency would be along the axis of rotation of the torus. So, the sphere's center is at the center of the generating circle of the torus.\n\nWait, so the sphere's radius is 11. The torus is inside the sphere, so the maximum distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is 11. But the torus's surface has points that are at a distance of R + r from the center, where R is 6 and r is 3. So R + r = 9. But 9 is less than 11, so the sphere is larger than the torus.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if the torus is inside the sphere, then the sphere's radius must be larger than the maximum distance from its center to the torus. But here, R + r = 9, which is less than 11, so that makes sense.\n\nBut how does the sphere and torus being tangent along a circle play into this? Hmm. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they are tangent along another circle.\n\nI think I need to find the radius of these circles of tangency. The problem defines r_i as the radius of the circle when the torus is inside, and r_o when it's outside.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's consider the sphere and the torus in a coordinate system where the center of the sphere is at the origin. Also, the torus's axis of rotation is along, say, the z-axis.\n\nWait, but the torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, which is at a distance of 6 from the center of that circle. So, the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0) in cylindrical coordinates, right? Because the distance from the origin is 6.\n\nSo, the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is generated by revolving the circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, with the generating circle's center at (6, 0, 0).\n\nSo, for the case where the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere of radius 11 is externally tangent to the torus. Wait, no. If the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is inside the sphere, and they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's externally tangent.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it is internally tangent. So, the sphere is larger, and the torus is inside, touching the sphere along a circle. The point of tangency is the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center.\n\nAlternatively, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, but the sphere is externally tangent. Wait, no, the sphere is fixed with radius 11, and the torus is either inside or outside. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere from the inside, and when it's outside, it's touching from the outside. So the sphere is fixed, and the torus is either inside or outside, touching the sphere along a circle.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface. The sphere's radius is 11, so the torus must be placed such that the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is 11.\n\nWait, but the torus is a surface of revolution, so every point on the torus is at a distance from the origin that depends on its position.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should model the points of tangency. The tangent circle on the sphere will lie in a plane, and all points on that circle are equidistant from the sphere's center.\n\nWait, but the sphere and the torus are tangent along a circle, so that circle must lie on both the sphere and the torus. So, that circle is a common intersection, and at each point on that circle, the sphere and torus share a common tangent plane.\n\nSo, for the internal tangency, the sphere is inside the torus, or the torus is inside the sphere? Wait, when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is inside the sphere, touching it. So, the sphere's center is at the same point as the torus's center? Or is it shifted?\n\nWait, no. The torus has its own center, which is the center of the generating circle, at a distance of 6 from the axis. Wait, no, the torus is symmetric around the axis, so its overall center is at the center of the generating circle, which is 6 units away from the axis.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's \"center\", which is 6 units. Because the generating circle is at (6,0,0), and the axis is the z-axis, which passes through the origin.\n\nSo, the center of the sphere is at (0,0,0), and the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0). So, the distance between the sphere's center and the generating circle's center is 6 units.\n\nNow, the sphere has a radius of 11, so the distance from the sphere's center to any point on the sphere is 11. The generating circle is at (6,0,0), radius 3.\n\nSo, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere must touch the torus at points closest to the sphere's center. So, the minimum distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is 11 - something?\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the distance from a point to a torus. The distance from the origin to a point on the torus can be as small as R - r, which is 6 - 3 = 3, and as large as R + r, which is 6 + 3 = 9. But the sphere's radius is 11, which is larger than 9, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere. So, how can the torus be externally tangent? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's placed such that it touches the sphere internally. The sphere's radius is 11, so the torus must be tangent to the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they're externally tangent along another circle.\n\nWait, so when the torus is inside, the sphere is larger, so the sphere's center is at the origin, and the torus is inside, touching the sphere. The points of tangency are on the side of the torus closest to the origin. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along a circle on the side of the torus farthest from the origin.\n\nSo, in both cases, the sphere's center is at the origin, and the torus is either inside or outside, touching the sphere along a circle.\n\nLet me think about the internal tangency first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is the closest point on the torus to the origin. So, the distance from the origin to this point is 11, because that's the sphere's radius. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the farthest point on the torus from the origin is 11.\n\nSo, the minimum distance from the origin to the torus is R - r = 6 - 3 = 3, and the maximum distance is R + r = 9. But the sphere has a radius of 11, which is larger than 9, so when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's surface is beyond the torus. So, the point where the sphere and torus touch must be where the torus is closest to the origin. But the closest distance is 3, which is less than 11, so the sphere must pass through points on the torus.\n\nWait, but the sphere's radius is 11, so the distance from the origin to any point on the sphere is 11. The torus's points vary between 3 and 9 from the origin. So, the sphere will intersect the torus in a circle when the torus is inside, but the problem states that it's tangent. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm modeling the problem incorrectly. Maybe the sphere is fixed, and the torus is inside or outside, and the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. So, the torus is either entirely inside the sphere, touching it along a circle, or entirely outside, touching along another circle.\n\nWait, but if the sphere is radius 11, and the torus's maximum distance from the origin is 9, then the torus is entirely inside the sphere. So, when it's placed inside, it's touching the sphere along a circle where the distance from the origin is 9? Because that's the farthest point on the torus. But that's inside the sphere of radius 11, so that point is 9 units from the origin, which is less than 11.\n\nWait, that can't be the point of tangency. Because if the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency must be where the torus is closest to the sphere's surface. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is fixed, and the torus is either inside or outside, and the sphere is tangent to the torus along a circle. So, for the internal tangency, the sphere is inside the torus, but that doesn't make sense because the torus is a surface, not a solid. Hmm, maybe the sphere is inside the torus when it's externally tangent.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem says, \"when T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent to S along a circle\", and when it rests on the outside, externally tangent. So, when T is inside S, it's touching S internally, meaning the sphere S is larger, and T is inside it. When T is outside S, S is inside T, and they're externally tangent.\n\nSo, in the internal case, the sphere is larger, and T is inside. The points of tangency are the closest points on T to the sphere's center. Wait, but earlier, the minimum distance from the origin to T is 3, and the sphere's radius is 11, so the sphere extends beyond T. So, the point where the sphere and T touch must be the point on T that is closest to the origin. But that point is only 3 units away, which is within the sphere's radius of 11. So, that doesn't make sense for tangency because the sphere would intersect the torus at that point, not just touch it.\n\nWait, maybe I have the direction wrong. Perhaps when T is inside S, it's placed such that the sphere S's surface is tangent to the torus's outer part. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the problem using the distance between the centers and the radii.\n\nWait, the torus is generated by a circle of radius 3, whose center is at a distance of 6 from the axis. So, the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis, which is the z-axis. So, in cylindrical coordinates, the center is at (6, 0, 0).\n\nThe sphere is centered at the origin, radius 11.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle. That means that at the point of tangency, the distance from the origin to the point on the torus is 11. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the distance from the origin to the point on the torus is 11 as well.\n\nWait, but the torus lies within a certain range of distances from the origin. The minimum distance is 6 - 3 = 3, and the maximum is 6 + 3 = 9. So, the torus is entirely within a sphere of radius 9, but our sphere is radius 11, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere. So, when it's placed inside, it's touching the sphere at points where the torus is farthest from the origin, at 9 units. So, the circle of tangency would have a radius of 9? But then, the problem says that when T rests on the inside, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. So, r_i would be 9? But wait, that's the distance from the origin, but the circle of tangency lies on the sphere, so the circle's radius in 3D space would be sqrt(11^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(121 - 81) = sqrt(40) = 2*sqrt(10). But wait, the problem defines r_i as the radius of the circle of tangency. Hmm, but is that the 3D radius or the radius in another sense?\n\nWait, no, the circle lies on the sphere, which is a 2D surface. So, the circle's radius on the sphere's surface would be the arc length, but I think the problem is referring to the planar radius, the radius in 3D space. So, the circle of tangency lies in a plane, and its radius is the distance from the center of that circle to any point on it.\n\nWait, but the sphere's center is at the origin, and the circle of tangency is a circle on the sphere. The distance from the origin to the plane of the circle would be some value, say d, and the radius of the circle would be sqrt(11^2 - d^2). That's because the sphere's cross-section perpendicular to the plane is a circle with radius sqrt(11^2 - d^2).\n\nSo, when the torus is inside the sphere, the circle of tangency lies in a plane at distance d from the origin, and the radius of that circle is sqrt(11^2 - d^2). Similarly, when it's outside, the same applies, but the distance would be different.\n\nSo, the problem is to find d_i for internal tangency and d_o for external tangency, then compute r_i = sqrt(11^2 - d_i^2) and r_o = sqrt(11^2 - d_o^2), then find r_i - r_o.\n\nWait, but how do I find d_i and d_o? I think this is where the geometry of the torus comes into play.\n\nLet me consider that the torus is generated by rotating a circle (radius 3) around the z-axis, with the center of that circle at (6, 0, 0). So, any point on the torus can be represented parametrically as ( (6 + 3 cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6, (6 + 3 cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6, 3 sin \u03b8 ), where \u03b8 and \u03c6 are angles parameterizing the torus.\n\nNow, for the sphere, the equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2.\n\nAt the point of tangency, the point on the torus lies on the sphere and has a common tangent plane. So, the gradients of the sphere and torus surfaces at that point must be parallel.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the point on the torus that is at distance 11 from the origin, and find the plane where this occurs, and then find the radius of that circle.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, the circle of tangency lies in a plane that is at a certain distance from the origin. Let me denote this distance as d. So, the points on the circle satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 and also lie on the plane, say, z = k or something. Wait, but the plane might not necessarily be aligned with the axes. Hmm.\n\nWait, but given the symmetry of the torus, which is around the z-axis, the plane of tangency should be perpendicular to the line connecting the origin to the center of the generating circle, which is along the x-axis. So, the plane of tangency would be perpendicular to the x-axis, so it would be a plane parallel to the y-z plane, at some x-coordinate, say x = a.\n\nSo, the points of tangency lie on the plane x = a, and also on the sphere x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121, and on the torus.\n\nSo, substituting x = a into the sphere equation, we get y^2 + z^2 = 121 - a^2. So, the radius of the circle of tangency in this plane is sqrt(121 - a^2).\n\nSimilarly, the points on the torus that lie on x = a must satisfy the torus equation.\n\nThe equation of the torus in Cartesian coordinates is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9.\n\nSo, substituting x = a, we have (sqrt(a^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nBut since the points lie on the plane x = a and on the sphere, y^2 + z^2 = 121 - a^2.\n\nLet me substitute y^2 + z^2 = 121 - a^2 into the torus equation.\n\nSo, (sqrt(a^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nExpanding the first term:\n\n= (sqrt(a^2 + y^2) )^2 - 12 sqrt(a^2 + y^2) + 36 + z^2 = 9\n\nSimplify:\n\n(a^2 + y^2) - 12 sqrt(a^2 + y^2) + 36 + z^2 = 9\n\nBut from the sphere equation, y^2 + z^2 = 121 - a^2.\n\nSo, substitute that in:\n\na^2 + (121 - a^2) - 12 sqrt(a^2 + y^2) + 36 = 9\n\nSimplify:\n\na^2 + 121 - a^2 - 12 sqrt(a^2 + y^2) + 36 = 9\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n121 + 36 - 12 sqrt(a^2 + y^2) = 9\n\nSo, 157 - 12 sqrt(a^2 + y^2) = 9\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n148 = 12 sqrt(a^2 + y^2)\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\nsqrt(a^2 + y^2) = 148 / 12 = 37/3 \u2248 12.333...\n\nWait, but sqrt(a^2 + y^2) is the radial distance in the x-y plane, which for the torus is at least 6 - 3 = 3 and at most 6 + 3 = 9. But 37/3 is approximately 12.333, which is way larger than 9. That can't be possible because the torus doesn't extend beyond 9 units in the x-y plane.\n\nHmm, that suggests that something is wrong in my approach. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The points of tangency lie on both the sphere and the torus, and the gradients at those points must be colinear.\n\nThe gradient of the sphere at a point (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2z), and the gradient of the torus at that point is the derivative.\n\nWait, the equation of the torus can be written as F(x, y, z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 - 9 = 0.\n\nSo, the gradient of F is ( ( (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 ) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) ), ( (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 ) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) ), 2z ).\n\nAt the point of tangency, the gradient of F must be a scalar multiple of the gradient of the sphere, which is (x, y, z). So,\n\n( ( (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 ) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) ), ( (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 ) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) ), 2z ) = \u03bb (x, y, z)\n\nfor some scalar \u03bb.\n\nSo, from the z-component, we get 2z = \u03bb z. So, either z = 0 or \u03bb = 2.\n\nIf z = 0, then from the sphere equation, x^2 + y^2 = 121. From the torus equation, (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + 0 = 9.\n\nSo sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 = \u00b13.\n\nSo, sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 6 \u00b1 3. So, 9 or 3.\n\nBut sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 9 would give x^2 + y^2 = 81, but from the sphere equation, x^2 + y^2 = 121. That's impossible. Similarly, sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 3 would give x^2 + y^2 = 9, which is less than 121. So, z cannot be zero, so we must have \u03bb = 2.\n\nSo, from the z-component, 2z = \u03bb z => \u03bb = 2.\n\nNow, looking at the x-component:\n\n( (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) ) = 2x.\n\nSimilarly for the y-component:\n\n( (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) ) = 2y.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(x^2 + y^2) as r. Then, the equations become:\n\n(r - 6) * (x / r) ) = 2x,\n\n(r - 6) * (y / r) ) = 2y.\n\nSo, for x \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by x:\n\n(r - 6)/r = 2.\n\nSimilarly for y \u2260 0:\n\n(r - 6)/r = 2.\n\nSo, same equation for both x and y, which implies that either both x and y are zero, or (r - 6)/r = 2.\n\nIf x and y are both zero, then from the sphere equation, z^2 = 121, so z = \u00b111. But the torus equation at x=0, y=0 would require (0 - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9 => 36 + z^2 = 9 => z^2 = -27, which is impossible. So, x and y cannot both be zero. Thus, we must have (r - 6)/r = 2.\n\nSolving that:\n\n(r - 6)/r = 2 => r - 6 = 2r => -6 = r.\n\nBut r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) which is always non-negative. So, r = -6 is impossible. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm, that suggests that there's no solution where \u03bb = 2 and z \u2260 0, which is confusing because I know that the sphere and torus do intersect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me recompute the gradient of F.\n\nF(x, y, z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 - 9.\n\nSo, the partial derivatives are:\n\ndF/dx = (2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) ) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) )\n\nSimilarly,\n\ndF/dy = (2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) ) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) )\n\ndF/dz = 2z.\n\nSo, the gradient is (dF/dx, dF/dy, dF/dz) as I had before.\n\nWait, but when I set dF/dx = 2x and dF/dy = 2y, I get the condition (r - 6)/r = 2, which gives r = -6, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that the only possible solution is when x = 0 and y = 0, which we saw is impossible. So, perhaps the sphere and torus don't intersect except at points where this condition is not met, which can't be right because the torus is entirely within the sphere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the point of tangency lies on the plane x = a. Maybe the plane isn't aligned with the x-axis? Alternatively, perhaps the point of tangency is at a different orientation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point of tangency isn't along the x-axis but lies somewhere else.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the points where the sphere and torus are tangent. Since the torus is symmetric around the z-axis, and the sphere is centered at the origin, the points of tangency should lie in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis, as the line connecting the origin to the center of the generating circle is along the x-axis.\n\nSo, perhaps the plane of tangency is x = a, as I thought earlier. So, let's go back to that approach.\n\nWe have the torus equation: (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nThe sphere equation: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nWe're looking for points where both equations are satisfied, and the gradients are colinear. Earlier, that approach led to a contradiction, which suggests that perhaps the points of tangency don't exist? But that can't be right because the problem states that the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the torus is placed such that its center is shifted, so that the sphere and torus are tangent at a single circle. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the distance from the origin to the torus's surface. The torus is a surface of revolution, so the minimum and maximum distances from the origin to the torus are 3 and 9, respectively.\n\nSo, for the internal tangency, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, which is larger than 9, so the sphere and torus must touch at the farthest point of the torus from the origin, which is 9 units away.\n\nSimilarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus must touch the sphere at the closest point on the torus, which is 3 units away from the origin. Wait, but 3 is less than 11, so that doesn't make sense because the sphere is larger. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, so the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus's inner radius is 3. So, the sphere is inside the torus, and touches it at the inner surface of the torus. But that would require the sphere's radius to be equal to the inner radius of the torus, which is 3, but the sphere's radius is 11, which is much larger. So, that can't be.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the cross-section. Let me think in 2D first. Imagine a circle of radius 3, centered at (6, 0), and we're revolving it around the z-axis to form the torus. The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is where the torus's outer surface is farthest from the origin, which is 6 + 3 = 9 units away. So, the sphere's surface at that point is at 11 units, but the torus is at 9 units, so the sphere is beyond the torus. So, the sphere and torus must intersect, not just touch at a single point.\n\nBut the problem says they are tangent along a circle, which suggests a single point of contact along a circle, not intersecting. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the torus is placed such that it's externally tangent to the sphere when it's outside. So, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside, and they touch along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is inside, it's touching along a circle. But I'm not sure how to compute the radii of these circles.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center (which is at (6,0,0)) and use some geometric relationships.\n\nThe distance between the sphere's center (origin) and the torus's center (6,0,0) is 6 units.\n\nThe sphere has a radius of 11, and the torus has a generating circle of radius 3. So, perhaps the point of tangency lies along the line connecting the two centers, which is the x-axis.\n\nWait, so the point of tangency would be along the x-axis at some point (a, 0, 0). On the sphere, this point must satisfy a^2 = 11^2, so a = \u00b111. But the torus's generating circle is at (6,0,0) with radius 3, so the point (6 + 3*1, 0, 0) is (9,0,0), which is the farthest point on the torus from the origin. So, 9 is less than 11, so (9,0,0) lies inside the sphere.\n\nWait, but if the torus is inside the sphere, the point (9,0,0) is on the torus and inside the sphere. So, how can the sphere and torus be tangent? Unless the sphere is just touching the torus at that point, but then the sphere's radius would have to be 9, not 11.\n\nThis is getting more confusing. Maybe I need to use some formula for the radius of the circle of tangency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the sphere's center to the torus's center. Wait, the line connecting the origin to (6,0,0) is along the x-axis, so the plane of tangency would be perpendicular to the x-axis, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, the points of tangency lie in this plane, and the radius of the circle in this plane is given by sqrt(11^2 - d^2), where d is the distance from the origin to the plane.\n\nBut how to find d?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance from the origin to the plane is the same as the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle minus the radius of the generating circle, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the generating circle is at (6,0,0) with radius 3. The plane of tangency is at x = a. So, the distance from (6,0,0) to the plane x = a is |6 - a|. Since the generating circle has radius 3, the point of tangency on the generating circle would be at a distance of 3 from (6,0,0) along the x-axis. So, a = 6 \u00b1 3, which gives a = 9 or a = 3.\n\nSo, the plane of tangency is at x = 9 or x = 3. But x = 9 is 9 units from the origin, which would be inside the sphere of radius 11, and x = 3 is inside as well.\n\nWait, but if the plane is at x = 9, then the radius of the circle of tangency is sqrt(11^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(121 - 81) = sqrt(40) = 2*sqrt(10). Similarly, at x = 3, the radius would be sqrt(11^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(121 - 9) = sqrt(112) = 4*sqrt(7).\n\nBut which one is which? When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along x = 9, giving r_i = 2*sqrt(10). When it's outside, it's tangent along x = 3, giving r_o = 4*sqrt(7). Then, the difference r_i - r_o = 2*sqrt(10) - 4*sqrt(7).\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the problem says r_i is for internal tangency and r_o for external. Also, 2*sqrt(10) is approximately 6.324, and 4*sqrt(7) is approximately 10.583, so their difference would be negative. But the problem says \"the difference r_i - r_o\", so perhaps I have them reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps when the torus is inside, the plane is at x = 9, so the circle's radius is 2*sqrt(10), and when it's outside, the plane is at x = 3, giving a larger circle? No, sqrt(112) is larger than sqrt(40). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm flipping the internal and external cases. Let me think again.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is the farthest point on the torus from the origin, which is at (9,0,0). So, the plane is at x = 9, and the radius of the circle is sqrt(11^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(40) = 2*sqrt(10). So, r_i = 2*sqrt(10).\n\nWhen the torus is outside, it's placed such that the sphere is inside the torus, and they are tangent along a circle. The closest point on the torus to the origin is at x = 3, so the plane is at x = 3, and the radius of the circle is sqrt(11^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(112) = 4*sqrt(7). So, r_o = 4*sqrt(7).\n\nThus, the difference r_i - r_o = 2*sqrt(10) - 4*sqrt(7). But wait, that's a negative number, which doesn't make sense if r_i is smaller than r_o. Perhaps I have the cases reversed.\n\nWait, when the torus is inside, the circle of tangency is at x = 9, with radius 2*sqrt(10), and when it's outside, the circle is at x = 3, with radius 4*sqrt(7). So, r_i = 2*sqrt(10) and r_o = 4*sqrt(7).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the difference r_i - r_o\". So, 2*sqrt(10) is about 6.324, and 4*sqrt(7) is about 10.583, so r_i - r_o is negative, which is -4.259. But the problem probably expects a positive difference, so perhaps I should take the absolute value, or maybe I have the definitions reversed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when the torus is outside, the circle of tangency is at x = 9, giving r_o = 2*sqrt(10), and when it's inside, it's at x = 3, giving r_i = 4*sqrt(7). That way, r_i - r_o would be positive.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because when the torus is inside, the sphere is larger, so the circle of tangency should be smaller. Wait, no. The radius of the circle of tangency on the sphere depends on how close the plane is to the origin. The closer the plane to the origin, the larger the circle's radius. So, when the torus is inside (tangent at x = 9), the plane is at x = 9, which is farther from the origin, so the circle's radius is smaller. When the torus is outside, the plane is at x = 3, closer to the origin, so the circle's radius is larger.\n\nSo, r_i (internal) would be the smaller radius, 2*sqrt(10), and r_o (external) would be the larger, 4*sqrt(7). So, r_i - r_o would be negative, but since the problem says to write the difference as m/n, perhaps they want the absolute value, or maybe I have the cases reversed.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assigning which case corresponds to which plane. Let me think.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is where the torus is farthest from the origin, at x = 9, which is still inside the sphere. So, the circle of tangency is smaller because it's farther from the origin. So, r_i = 2*sqrt(10).\n\nWhen the torus is outside the sphere, it's placed such that the sphere is inside the torus, and they are tangent at the closest point on the torus to the origin, which is x = 3. So, the plane is at x = 3, closer to the origin, leading to a larger circle on the sphere. So, r_o = 4*sqrt(7).\n\nThus, the difference r_i - r_o = 2*sqrt(10) - 4*sqrt(7). But this is negative, which may not be intended. Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines r_i as the internal tangent (smaller) and r_o as the external (larger), so the difference would be negative, but the problem might just take the absolute value.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the difference r_i - r_o can be written as m/n\". So, if it's negative, m would be negative, but the problem specifies m and n as positive integers. So, perhaps I have the assignments reversed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have the planes wrong. Let me try again.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is the farthest point from the origin on the torus, which is at x = 9, so the plane is at x = 9, and the circle's radius is sqrt(11^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(40) = 2*sqrt(10). So, r_i = 2*sqrt(10).\n\nWhen the torus is outside the sphere, the point of tangency is the closest point on the torus to the origin, which is at x = 3, so the plane is at x = 3, and the circle's radius is sqrt(11^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(112) = 4*sqrt(7). So, r_o = 4*sqrt(7).\n\nThus, r_i = 2\u221a10, r_o = 4\u221a7.\n\nSo, the difference is r_i - r_o = 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7.\n\nTo express this as a fraction, we need to rationalize or find a common denominator. But both terms are irrational, so perhaps we need to find a way to express them as a single fraction.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because they're unlike terms. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the radii of the circles of tangency in 3D and then find the difference.\n\nWait, another approach: The radius of the circle of tangency on the sphere can be found using the formula for the radius of a circle cut from a sphere by a plane at distance d from the center: r = sqrt(R^2 - d^2), where R is the sphere's radius, and d is the distance from the center to the plane.\n\nSo, for internal tangency, the plane is at x = 9, so d = 9. Then, r_i = sqrt(11^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(121 - 81) = sqrt(40) = 2*sqrt(10).\n\nFor external tangency, the plane is at x = 3, so d = 3. Then, r_o = sqrt(11^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(121 - 9) = sqrt(112) = 4*sqrt(7).\n\nThus, r_i = 2\u221a10 \u2248 6.324, r_o = 4\u221a7 \u2248 10.583.\n\nSo, the difference r_i - r_o = 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7.\n\nBut the problem states that the difference can be written as m/n, which suggests a rational number, but 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7 is irrational. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misapplied the concept of internal and external tangency.\n\nWait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the point of tangency would be where the torus is closest to the sphere's surface. But the closest point on the torus to the origin is 3 units away, but the sphere's radius is 11, so the sphere extends 11 units. So, perhaps the point of tangency is where the torus is closest to the origin, but that's at 3 units, which is much less than 11. That doesn't make sense because the sphere would pass through the torus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle that's not aligned with the x-axis. So, perhaps the plane of tangency is not perpendicular to the x-axis. That complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the circle of tangency lies in a plane that's at an angle, not perpendicular to the x-axis. But that would require more complex calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the distance from the origin to the torus's surface along the line of centers. The line of centers is the line connecting the origin to the center of the generating circle, which is along the x-axis.\n\nSo, the points on the torus along this line are at x = 6 \u00b1 3, so at x = 9 and x = 3. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is at x = 9, and when it's outside, at x = 3.\n\nWait, but then the sphere's radius is 11, so the sphere is larger than the torus, so when the torus is inside, the sphere touches the torus at x = 9, which is the farthest point on the torus from the origin, and when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and the sphere touches the torus at x = 3, which is the closest point on the torus to the origin.\n\nWait, but the sphere is radius 11, which is larger than the torus's maximum distance from the origin (9), so when the torus is outside, it can't contain the sphere. So, perhaps the external tangency is impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem states both internal and external tangency. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the torus is placed such that its center is at a different position relative to the sphere. Maybe the distance between the centers is important.\n\nWait, the torus is generated by a circle of radius 3, centered at (6,0,0), and the sphere is centered at (0,0,0) with radius 11. So, the distance between the centers is 6 units.\n\nSo, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus's maximum distance from the origin is 9, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere. So, the point of tangency would be where the torus is farthest from the origin, at x = 9. So, the sphere touches the torus at that point, and the circle of tangency lies in the plane x = 9, with radius sqrt(11^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(40) = 2*sqrt(10).\n\nWhen the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus's inner radius is 3, so to have the sphere inside the torus, the sphere's radius must be equal to or less than the torus's inner radius. But 11 is greater than 3, so the sphere can't be inside the torus. Therefore, perhaps the external tangency is impossible, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, that suggests that my understanding is incorrect. Maybe the torus is placed such that it's outside the sphere, and the sphere is inside the torus, but the sphere's radius is 11, which is larger than the torus's inner radius of 3. So, that's not possible.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the sphere and torus as surfaces and find the points where they are tangent. The torus can be parameterized as:\n\nx = (R + r cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6\n\ny = (R + r cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6\n\nz = r sin \u03b8\n\nwhere R = 6, r = 3.\n\nThe sphere's equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2.\n\nAt the point of tangency, the normals to the sphere and torus are colinear, so their gradients are proportional.\n\nThe gradient of the sphere at (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2z).\n\nThe gradient of the torus can be found by differentiating the equation F(x, y, z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 - r^2 = 0.\n\nSo, F = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 - r^2.\n\ndF/dx = 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)).\n\nSimilarly,\n\ndF/dy = 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R) * (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)).\n\ndF/dz = 2z.\n\nSo, the gradient of F is (dF/dx, dF/dy, dF/dz).\n\nAt the point of tangency, the gradients must be proportional, so there exists a scalar \u03bb such that:\n\ndF/dx = \u03bb * (2x)\n\ndF/dy = \u03bb * (2y)\n\ndF/dz = \u03bb * (2z)\n\nFrom dF/dz = 2z = \u03bb * 2z, if z \u2260 0, then \u03bb = 1. If z = 0, then from the sphere equation, x^2 + y^2 = 121, and from the torus equation, (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + 0 = 9 \u2192 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 6 \u00b1 3 \u2192 9 or 3. But x^2 + y^2 = 121 or 9, which is impossible, so z cannot be zero. So, \u03bb = 1.\n\nThus, dF/dx = 2x \u2192 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) ) = 2x \u2192 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) * (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) ) = x.\n\nAssuming x \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by x:\n\n(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(x^2 + y^2):\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).\n\nThis implies -6 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, there is no solution where \u03bb = 1, implying that the sphere and torus don't intersect except possibly at points where x = 0 or y = 0, but we saw that z cannot be zero either.\n\nThis suggests that the sphere and torus don't intersect, which contradicts the problem statement. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the point of tangency isn't on the x-axis. Let me try without assuming any symmetry.\n\nLet me consider a general point (x, y, z) on both the sphere and the torus, and where their gradients are colinear.\n\nFrom the sphere: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nFrom the torus: (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nSubtracting the torus equation from the sphere equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 - [ (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 ] = 121 - 9 \u2192 x^2 + y^2 - (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 = 112.\n\nLet me expand (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2:\n\n= x^2 + y^2 - 12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + 36.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - [x^2 + y^2 - 12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + 36] = 112 \u2192 x^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 + 12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 36 = 112 \u2192 12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 36 = 112 \u2192 12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 148 \u2192 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 148 / 12 = 37/3 \u224812.333.\n\nBut this is impossible because the torus's maximum distance from the origin in the x-y plane is 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 37/3 \u224812.333. So, this suggests that there are no points of intersection, which can't be right because the problem states that the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my approach. Maybe I should consider that the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle, meaning that they intersect at infinitely many points along that circle, and the gradients are colinear at all those points.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the circle of tangency lies in a plane that's not perpendicular to the x-axis. Let me suppose that the plane has a normal vector (a, b, c), and that the gradients of the sphere and torus are colinear in that plane.\n\nBut this approach seems too complicated for my current understanding. Maybe I should look for another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. The torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. The sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is larger, so the torus touches the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside, and they touch along another circle.\n\nThe radii of these circles can be found using the formula for the radius of a circle cut from a sphere by a plane at a certain distance from the center.\n\nFor internal tangency, the distance from the sphere's center to the plane is 6 + 3 = 9, so the radius of the circle is sqrt(11^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(40) = 2\u221a10.\n\nFor external tangency, the distance from the sphere's center to the plane is 6 - 3 = 3, so the radius of the circle is sqrt(11^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(112) = 4\u221a7.\n\nThus, r_i = 2\u221a10, r_o = 4\u221a7.\n\nThe difference is r_i - r_o = 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7.\n\nBut this is an irrational number, and the problem states that the difference can be written as m/n, a fraction of integers. So, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance from the sphere's center to the plane is not 6 \u00b1 3, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the problem using the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus's generating circle, which is 6 units. The sphere has radius 11, and the generating circle has radius 3.\n\nSo, when the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is where the generating circle is farthest from the sphere's center, which is 6 + 3 = 9 units away. So, the sphere touches the torus at that point, and the circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, at a distance of 9 from the origin.\n\nSimilarly, when the torus is outside, the point of tangency is where the generating circle is closest to the origin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 units away. So, the sphere touches the torus at that point, and the circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, at a distance of 3 from the origin.\n\nThus, the radii of the circles of tangency are sqrt(11^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(40) = 2\u221a10, and sqrt(11^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(112) = 4\u221a7.\n\nSo, r_i = 2\u221a10, r_o = 4\u221a7.\n\nThe difference r_i - r_o = 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7.\n\nBut this is irrational, which contradicts the problem statement that the difference is m/n, a fraction of integers. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the radii correctly. Let me compute 2\u221a10 and 4\u221a7.\n\n2\u221a10 is approximately 6.324, and 4\u221a7 is approximately 10.583. So, their difference is approximately -4.259.\n\nBut the problem says to write the difference as m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers. So, perhaps I have to rationalize or find a common expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the difference in radii to be expressed as a fraction after rationalizing. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the radius of the circle of tangency is not sqrt(R^2 - d^2), but something else.\n\nWait, no, that formula is correct. The radius of the circle where the sphere is cut by a plane at distance d from the center is indeed sqrt(R^2 - d^2).\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, but the problem statement might have a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the circle lying in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, but in a different orientation. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this and not making progress, perhaps I should accept that the difference is 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7, but that can't be expressed as a fraction of integers. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is in 2D and compute the radii in that context.\n\nImagine a circle (the generating circle of the torus) of radius 3, centered at (6, 0), and the sphere of radius 11 centered at (0,0). When the circle is inside the sphere, the sphere touches the circle at its farthest point, which is at (9,0), and when it's outside, it touches at (3,0). But in 2D, the circle of tangency would be a single point, not a circle. So, maybe this approach isn't applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the major and minor circles of the torus. The major radius is 6, and the minor radius is 3. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere touches the major circle, giving r_i = 6, and when it's outside, it touches the minor circle, giving r_o = 3. Then, the difference would be 3, which is 3/1, so m + n = 4. But that seems too simplistic and probably incorrect.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions circles of tangency, so they must be circles, not single points. So, this approach is likely wrong.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is r_i = 2\u221a10 and r_o = 4\u221a7, so the difference is 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7. But since this can't be expressed as a fraction of integers, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me go back.\n\nThe problem says the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance of 6 from the center. So, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is externally tangent to the torus along a circle with radius r_i.\n\nSimilarly, when the torus is outside, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_o.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this using the distance between the centers and the radii.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11, the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center (which is at (6,0,0)) is 6 units. The sphere's radius is 11, so the point of tangency is where the sphere's surface is closest to the torus's center, which is 11 - 6 = 5 units from the torus's center. But the torus's minor radius is 3, so 5 > 3, which suggests that the sphere doesn't touch the torus when it's inside. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point of tangency is where the sphere's surface is tangent to the outer part of the torus, which is at a distance of 6 + 3 = 9 from the origin. So, the sphere's radius is 11, so the distance from the origin to the point of tangency is 9, which is less than 11, so the sphere passes beyond the torus.\n\nWait, but how can the sphere and torus be tangent in that case? They should intersect at that point.\n\nI'm clearly missing something here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look up the formula for the radius of the circle of tangency between a sphere and a torus. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to proceed with what I have.\n\nAssuming r_i = 2\u221a10 and r_o = 4\u221a7, the difference is 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7. But since the problem expects this as a fraction m/n, I must have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should rationalize the difference:\n\n2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7 = 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7.\n\nBut this doesn't simplify to a fraction. So, maybe the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle, which is 6 units, and the sphere's radius is 11. The circle of tangency would then be at a distance from the origin such that the sphere's radius squared equals the sum of the square of the distance from the origin to the plane and the square of the circle's radius.\n\nSo, for internal tangency, the sphere's radius is 11, and the distance from the origin to the plane is d, so:\n\n11^2 = d^2 + r_i^2 \u2192 r_i = sqrt(121 - d^2).\n\nSimilarly, for external tangency, r_o = sqrt(121 - d'^2).\n\nNow, the distance d and d' are related to the torus's geometry.\n\nWhen the torus is inside, the point of tangency is on the outer part of the torus, so the distance from the origin to that point is 6 + 3 = 9, which is also the distance from the origin to the plane. So, d = 9, and r_i = sqrt(121 - 81) = sqrt(40) = 2\u221a10.\n\nWhen the torus is outside, the point of tangency is on the inner part of the torus, at distance 6 - 3 = 3 from the origin, so d' = 3, and r_o = sqrt(121 - 9) = sqrt(112) = 4\u221a7.\n\nThus, r_i = 2\u221a10, r_o = 4\u221a7.\n\nThe difference r_i - r_o = 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7.\n\nSince this can't be expressed as a fraction of integers, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the difference as (2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7) and rationalize it. But that's not possible as it stands.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the difference to be expressed as (2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7) = 2(\u221a10 - 2\u221a7), but that still doesn't give a fraction of integers.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to conclude that the difference is 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7, but since this can't be expressed as a fraction, I must have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is that the difference is 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7, but since the problem states it can be written as m/n, I'll have to consider that maybe the difference is zero, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the difference as 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7 and see if it can be simplified to a fraction. But I don't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the radii. Let me check:\n\nFor internal tangency, the plane is at x = 9, so the radius is sqrt(121 - 81) = sqrt(40) = 2\u221a10.\n\nFor external tangency, the plane is at x = 3, so the radius is sqrt(121 - 9) = sqrt(112) = 4\u221a7.\n\nThus, the difference is 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7.\n\nBut since this is irrational, perhaps the problem expects the absolute value, giving 4\u221a7 - 2\u221a10, which is positive.\n\nBut the problem says \"the difference r_i - r_o\", so it's possible that r_i < r_o, making the difference negative, but the problem might just want the magnitude.\n\nIn any case, I think I've reached the limit of my understanding, and I'll have to conclude that the answer is 2\u221a10 - 4\u221a7, but since that can't be expressed as a fraction, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the radii of the circles as measured on the sphere's surface, which would be angles, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the difference in the radii of the circles of tangency in 3D space, which are 2\u221a10 and 4\u221a7, and express their difference as a fraction. But that's not possible because they're irrational.\n\nSo, perhaps I should accept that I'm unable to solve this problem correctly at the moment.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the difference in radii of the circles where a torus is tangent to a sphere, both internally and externally. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, it is tangent along a circle whose radius is calculated as follows:\n- The distance from the sphere's center to the plane of tangency is 9 (the maximum distance from the origin on the torus).\n- The radius of the circle of tangency is \\( r_i = \\sqrt{11^2 - 9^2} = \\sqrt{40} = 2\\sqrt{10} \\).\n\nWhen the torus is outside the sphere, it is tangent along another circle:\n- The distance from the sphere's center to the plane of tangency is 3 (the minimum distance from the origin on the torus).\n- The radius of the circle of tangency is \\( r_o = \\sqrt{11^2 - 3^2} = \\sqrt{112} = 4\\sqrt{7} \\).\n\nThe difference \\( r_i - r_o \\) is \\( 2\\sqrt{10} - 4\\sqrt{7} \\). However, since this difference is irrational and the problem expects it in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are integers, it's likely that further simplification or a different approach is needed. Given the constraints and the calculations performed, the final answer based on the derived values is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10} - 4\\sqrt{7}}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since this doesn't fit the expected format, it's possible that the correct answer involves rationalizing or re-evaluating the approach. Due to the complexity and the time spent, the final answer is presented as above.",
