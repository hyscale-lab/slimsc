      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nWe have points O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point O is the origin, A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nThey're talking about a family of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ connects a point P (p, 0) on the x-axis to a point Q (0, q) on the y-axis, with the distance between P and Q being 1. \n\nSo, the first thing I should do is figure out the relationship between p and q for these segments PQ. Since PQ is a unit segment, the distance formula gives sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, all such segments PQ satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1, with p and q positive because they're in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, the family F consists of all such PQ segments where p and q are positive and satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nNow, the problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, we need to find this point C such that it's on AB, and no other PQ in F passes through it.\n\nOnce we find C, we need to compute OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then express this as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.\n\nLet me outline the steps I think I need to take:\n\n1. Find the equation of line AB.\n2. Parametrize point C on AB.\n3. Find the condition that C doesn't lie on any other segment PQ from F except AB.\n4. Use this condition to solve for the coordinates of C.\n5. Compute OC\u00b2 and simplify it to find p and q.\n\nLet's start with step 1: equation of line AB.\n\nPoints A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nStep 2: Parametrize point C on AB.\n\nLet me let point C be (x, y) lying on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, any point C can be expressed as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nAlternatively, since it's on AB, maybe using a parameter t where t ranges from 0 to 1. Let's see, when t=0, it's point B, and t=1, it's point A.\n\nWait, actually, let's parameterize AB. From A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)t\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t\n\nWhere t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be expressed as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ). That might be useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just express C as (x, y) with y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nStep 3: Find the condition that C doesn't lie on any other segment PQ from F except AB.\n\nSo, each segment PQ is from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe need to find that for point C, there is no other (p, q) besides the one corresponding to AB such that C lies on PQ.\n\nWait, but AB is itself a segment PQ in F? Let's check.\n\nWait, AB connects point A(1/2, 0) to point B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's see if this is a unit segment.\n\nCompute the distance between A and B: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a segment in F.\n\nSo, AB is PQ with p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which confirms AB is in F.\n\nSo, the point C lies on AB, and we need to find the unique C on AB (other than A and B) which is not on any other PQ in F.\n\nSo, the problem is that for this point C, there is no other PQ (i.e., with different p and q) such that C is on PQ.\n\nSo, if we can find the point C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ, except for AB itself.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to find the envelope of all segments PQ in F, and then find where AB intersects this envelope, which should be at point C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find the condition that for point C, there's no other segment PQ other than AB passing through it.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another approach: for a point C(x, y) on AB, to ensure that it doesn't lie on any other PQ (p, q) in F, except AB.\n\nSo, for C not to lie on any other PQ, the equations of PQ must not have solutions except for the specific PQ that is AB.\n\nSo, for any other PQ, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, since PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, q).\n\nSo, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, for point C(x, y), if we plug into this equation, x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nNow, for AB, p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, so x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2x + (2y)/sqrt(3) = 1.\n\nWhich is indeed the equation of AB: 2x + (2y)/sqrt(3) = 1. Which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, as before.\n\nNow, for point C to not lie on any other PQ in F, the equation x/p + y/q = 1 must have no solution (p, q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, except for p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, for point C(x, y), the equation x/p + y/q =1 must have only one solution (p, q) on the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, we can set up the problem as finding the point C(x, y) on AB such that the system:\n\nx/p + y/q = 1\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nhas exactly one solution, (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nIn other words, the equation x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 should have only this solution.\n\nSo, perhaps using the condition that the system has exactly one solution, which would imply that the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 at (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nWait, that seems promising.\n\nBecause if the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle, then it touches the circle at exactly one point, which would be (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, for point C, the line equation x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle at (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nWait, but in our case, the equation is x/p + y/q =1, but p and q are variables on the unit circle. So, perhaps treating p and q as variables, the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. That would mean that this line touches the circle at exactly one point, which would be the point (p, q) corresponding to the given x and y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can see that for a given point C(x, y), the equation x/p + y/q =1 must have exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle, which is the point (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, to find such a point C(x, y), we can set up the condition that the system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nhas exactly one solution, which is (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nThis should give us a condition on x and y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of duality. In projective geometry, the condition that a line is tangent to a circle is that the distance from the center to the line equals the radius. But wait, the circle here is p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, so the center is at (0,0), and the radius is 1.\n\nThe line is x/p + y/q =1. Wait, but that line is in terms of p and q. Hmm, perhaps I should treat p and q as variables, and x and y as constants. So, for the line x/p + y/q =1, the distance from the origin (0,0) to this line should be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1.\n\nWait, but wait, the distance from a point (p0, q0) to the line a/p + b/q =1 is not straightforward. Wait, perhaps I should rearrange the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the line equation in standard form. Let me see:\n\nx/p + y/q =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by pq: x q + y p = pq.\n\nBring all terms to one side: y p - x q + x q - pq =0? Wait, that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express it as y p + x q = p q.\n\nHmm, perhaps rearranged as y p + x q - p q =0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor:\n\np(y - q) + x q =0. Not sure if that's helpful.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the line x/p + y/q =1 as a linear equation in p and q.\n\nWait, for fixed x and y, the equation is x/p + y/q =1, which can be rewritten as (x q + y p) / (p q) ) =1, so x q + y p = p q.\n\nSo, the equation is p q - y p - x q =0.\n\nLet me factor this equation:\n\np q - y p - x q =0.\n\nI can factor it as:\n\np(q - y) -x q =0.\n\nHmm, not too helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rearrange terms:\n\np q - y p - x q =0.\n\np q - y p = x q.\n\np(q - y) = x q.\n\np = (x q)/(q - y).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the condition that the system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nhas exactly one solution (p, q).\n\nSo, for a given x and y, the equation x/p + y/q =1 must intersect the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 at exactly one point, which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, this line is tangent to the unit circle at that point.\n\nWait, but the line is in terms of p and q, so perhaps we can compute the condition that this line is tangent to the circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nThe condition for a line a p + b q +c =0 to be tangent to the circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=r\u00b2 is that the distance from the center to the line equals r.\n\nBut in our case, the equation is x/p + y/q =1, which can be rewritten as (x q + y p - p q)/ (p q) =0, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the equation as x/p + y/q =1 in standard form.\n\nLet me write it as x q + y p = p q.\n\nThen, the equation is x q + y p = p q.\n\nWait, perhaps rearranged as x q + y p - p q =0.\n\nWhich is x q + y p = p q.\n\nSo, bringing everything to one side: x q + y p - p q =0.\n\nI can factor this as p(y - q) + x q =0.\n\nHmm, not so helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write it as:\n\nx q + y p = p q.\n\nLet me rearrange this as:\n\np q - x q - y p =0.\n\nThen, factor:\n\nq (p - x) - y p =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of p and q:\n\np q - x q - y p =0.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider this as a quadratic equation in p and q.\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to consider the system:\n\nEquation 1: x/p + y/q =1.\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe can solve this system for p and q, and then impose that it has exactly one solution, which is (p, q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substitute variables.\n\nLet me consider Equation 1: x/p + y/q =1.\n\nLet me denote u =1/p and v=1/q. Then, Equation 1 becomes x u + y v =1.\n\nEquation 2: (1/u)^2 + (1/v)^2=1.\n\nSo, Equation 2 becomes 1/u\u00b2 + 1/v\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo, the system becomes:\n\nx u + y v =1,\n\n1/u\u00b2 + 1/v\u00b2=1.\n\nNow, we can try to find the condition where this system has exactly one solution (u, v), corresponding to (p, q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, u=2, v=2/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, plug u=2, v=2/sqrt(3) into Equation 1: x*2 + y*(2/sqrt(3))=1.\n\nWhich is 2x + (2 y)/sqrt(3) =1. Which is the equation of AB, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, we can set up the condition that this system has exactly one solution, which is when the line x u + y v=1 is tangent to the curve 1/u\u00b2 + 1/v\u00b2=1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding (x, y) on AB such that the line x u + y v=1 is tangent to 1/u\u00b2 +1/v\u00b2=1.\n\nSo, to find the condition for tangency, we can substitute v from the line equation into the curve equation and set the discriminant of the resulting equation to zero.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFrom Equation 1: x u + y v =1 \u2192 v = (1 -x u)/y.\n\nSubstitute this into Equation 2: 1/u\u00b2 + 1/v\u00b2=1.\n\nSo,\n\n1/u\u00b2 + 1/( (1 -x u)^2 / y\u00b2 ) =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/u\u00b2 + y\u00b2/(1 -x u)^2 =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by u\u00b2 (1 -x u)^2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(1 -x u)^2 + y\u00b2 u\u00b2 = u\u00b2 (1 -x u)^2.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, Equation 2 after substitution:\n\n1/u\u00b2 + y\u00b2/(1 - x u)^2 =1.\n\nSo, multiply both sides by u\u00b2*(1 -x u)^2:\n\n(1 -x u)^2 + y\u00b2 u\u00b2 = u\u00b2 (1 -x u)^2.\n\nWait, that would be:\n\n[1/u\u00b2]*u\u00b2*(1 -x u)^2 + [y\u00b2/(1 -x u)^2] *u\u00b2*(1 -x u)^2 =1 *u\u00b2*(1 -x u)^2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(1 -x u)^2 + y\u00b2 u\u00b2 = u\u00b2 (1 -x u)^2.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 -2x u +x\u00b2 u\u00b2) + y\u00b2 u\u00b2 = u\u00b2 (1 - 2x u + x\u00b2 u\u00b2).\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\nu\u00b2 (1 - 2x u +x\u00b2 u\u00b2) = u\u00b2 - 2x u^3 +x\u00b2 u^4.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n1 - 2x u +x\u00b2 u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 u\u00b2 = u\u00b2 - 2x u^3 +x\u00b2 u^4.\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n1 -2x u +x\u00b2 u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 u\u00b2 -u\u00b2 +2x u^3 -x\u00b2 u^4 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 -2x u + (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1) u\u00b2 + 2x u^3 -x\u00b2 u^4 =0.\n\nSo, this is a quartic equation in u:\n\n(-x\u00b2) u^4 + 2x u^3 + (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1) u\u00b2 -2x u +1 =0.\n\nWe can write it as:\n\nA u^4 + B u^3 + C u^2 + D u + E =0,\n\nwhere,\n\nA = -x\u00b2,\n\nB = 2x,\n\nC = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1,\n\nD = -2x,\n\nE =1.\n\nSince we want the line to be tangent to the curve, the quartic equation must have a double root. However, quartic equations can be complicated, but perhaps since we know that u=2 is a root (since the point (u, v)=(2, 2/sqrt(3)) is on the line and the curve), we can factor it out.\n\nSo, let's perform polynomial division to factor out (u - 2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that since u=2 is a double root, (u -2)^2 is a factor.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to substitute u=2 into the quartic equation and set both the equation and its derivative with respect to u to zero.\n\nBecause if u=2 is a double root, then both the quartic and its derivative will be zero at u=2.\n\nSo, let's compute the quartic equation at u=2 and set it to zero:\n\nAt u=2,\n\n(-x\u00b2)(2)^4 + 2x (2)^3 + (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1)(2)^2 + (-2x)(2) +1 =0.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(-x\u00b2)(16) = -16x\u00b2,\n\n2x*(8) =16x,\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1)*4 =4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 -4,\n\n-2x*2= -4x,\n\n+1.\n\nSum all terms:\n\n-16x\u00b2 +16x +4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 -4 -4x +1 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-16x\u00b2 +4x\u00b2) + (16x -4x) +4y\u00b2 + (-4 +1) =0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-12x\u00b2 +12x +4y\u00b2 -3 =0.\n\nSo, equation 1: -12x\u00b2 +12x +4y\u00b2 -3=0.\n\nNow, compute the derivative of the quartic equation with respect to u, evaluated at u=2.\n\nThe quartic equation is:\n\nF(u) = (-x\u00b2) u^4 + 2x u^3 + (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1) u^2 -2x u +1.\n\nThe derivative F\u2019(u) is:\n\nF\u2019(u) = -4x\u00b2 u^3 +6x u^2 + 2(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1) u -2x.\n\nEvaluate at u=2:\n\nF\u2019(2) = -4x\u00b2*(8) +6x*(4) + 2(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1)*2 -2x.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n-4x\u00b2*8 = -32x\u00b2,\n\n6x*4=24x,\n\n2*(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1)*2 =4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -1),\n\n-2x.\n\nSo, F\u2019(2)= -32x\u00b2 +24x +4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 -4 -2x.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-32x\u00b2 +4x\u00b2) + (24x -2x) +4y\u00b2 -4 = (-28x\u00b2) +22x +4y\u00b2 -4.\n\nSince u=2 is a double root, F\u2019(2)=0:\n\nEquation 2: -28x\u00b2 +22x +4y\u00b2 -4 =0.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. -12x\u00b2 +12x +4y\u00b2 -3=0,\n\n2. -28x\u00b2 +22x +4y\u00b2 -4=0.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate 4y\u00b2.\n\nEquation 2 minus equation 1:\n\n(-28x\u00b2 +22x +4y\u00b2 -4) - (-12x\u00b2 +12x +4y\u00b2 -3) =0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(-28x\u00b2 +22x +4y\u00b2 -4) +12x\u00b2 -12x -4y\u00b2 +3=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-28x\u00b2 +12x\u00b2) + (22x -12x) + (4y\u00b2 -4y\u00b2) + (-4 +3) =0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-16x\u00b2 +10x -1=0.\n\nSo, equation 3: -16x\u00b2 +10x -1=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n16x\u00b2 -10x +1=0.\n\nSolve for x using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [10 \u00b1 sqrt(100 - 64)] /32.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n100 -64=36.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [10 \u00b16]/32.\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\nx=(10+6)/32=16/32=1/2,\n\nx=(10-6)/32=4/32=1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/2 or x=1/8.\n\nBut x=1/2 corresponds to point A, which we're told to exclude, as we're looking for a point C distinct from A and B. So, x=1/8 must be the x-coordinate of point C.\n\nNow, find the corresponding y-coordinate.\n\nSince point C lies on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, when x=1/8,\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, compute OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nOC\u00b2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1/64) + (27/64) = (28)/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, because (3 sqrt(3))^2 is 9*3=27, so yeah.\n\nSo, 1 +27=28, over 64, which simplifies to 7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16. Therefore, p=7 and q=16, which are coprime.\n\nSo, p + q= 7 +16=23.\n\nSo, the answer is 23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the equation of line AB. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, \u221a3/2) define a line with slope -\u221a3. The equation is y = -\u221a3 x + \u221a3/2.\n\nWe then consider the family of segments PQ, each of unit length, where P(p, 0) and Q(0, q) satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. The equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nTo find the unique point C on AB that does not lie on any other PQ from F, we require that the line x/p + y/q = 1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1 at (1/2, \u221a3/2). This tangency condition leads to solving a system where the line touches the circle at exactly one point.\n\nBy substituting and simplifying, we find the coordinates of C on AB. Solving the resulting equations, we determine C to be (1/8, 3\u221a3/8). Finally, we compute OC\u00b2, which is (1/8)\u00b2 + (3\u221a3/8)\u00b2 = 7/16. Thus, p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.\n\n**Answer:** 23",
