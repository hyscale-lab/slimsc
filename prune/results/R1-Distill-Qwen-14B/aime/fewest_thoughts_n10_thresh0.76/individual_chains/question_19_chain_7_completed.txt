Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again. It says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC, with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product of AB and AC.

Alright, let's start by recalling some properties and formulas related to triangle centers and inradius and circumradius.

First, the circumradius R is given as 13. The inradius r is given as 6.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter I and the circumcenter O can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Oh yeah, I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Hmm. Let me verify.

Wait, no, I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, if R is 13 and r is 6, then OI² = 13² - 2*13*6.

Calculating that: 13² is 169, and 2*13*6 is 156. So, OI² = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13). So, OI = √13.

But wait, hold on. Is that formula correct? I think the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr, but let me make sure.

Wait, no, I think it's actually OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me check the formula.

Wait, another source says that in any triangle, OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, yes, that formula is correct. So, OI is sqrt(13). Got it.

Okay, now, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA ⊥ OI.

Hmm. IA is the segment from inradius I to vertex A, and OI is the segment from inradius I to circumradius O. So, these two are perpendicular.

I think maybe we can use coordinate geometry here. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) to simplify things. Then, since OI is a vector from I to O, and IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can align the coordinate system such that OI lies along one axis, say the x-axis, and IA lies along the y-axis.

So, let's let OI be along the x-axis. Since OI is sqrt(13), and I is at (0,0), then O is at (sqrt(13), 0).

Wait, but then IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, so IA would be along the y-axis. So, point A is somewhere along the y-axis.

Wait, but point A is a vertex of the triangle, so it's not necessarily on the y-axis. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps I can place I at (0,0), and O at (d, 0), where d is the distance between O and I. Wait, but we just calculated d as sqrt(13). So, O is at (sqrt(13), 0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, IA must be along the y-axis.

But wait, point A is a vertex of the triangle. So, point A is somewhere in the plane, and IA is the segment from I to A, which is along the y-axis. So, point A would have coordinates (0, a) for some a. Is that possible?

Wait, but if I is at (0,0) and IA is along the y-axis, then point A is at (0, a). Then, the line IA is vertical, and OI is along the x-axis, so they are perpendicular. That makes sense.

So, in this coordinate system, I is at (0,0), O is at (sqrt(13), 0), and A is at (0, a). Hmm.

But then, what about points B and C? They are other vertices of the triangle, but I don't know their coordinates yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use vector methods or coordinate geometry to find AB and AC.

Wait, but maybe there's a more straightforward approach using triangle properties.

Wait, let's recall that in a triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter: r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c by the formula R = (a b c)/(4A).

Hmm, but I don't know the sides yet. So, maybe I can find expressions for these.

Given that, maybe I can find the sides in terms of other variables.

But perhaps another approach: since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can use some properties related to vectors or coordinate geometry.

Wait, let me think. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.

If I set up a coordinate system with I at (0,0) and O at (sqrt(13), 0), then vector OI is (sqrt(13), 0). Vector IA would be from I (0,0) to A (x, y), which is (x, y). The dot product of OI and IA is (sqrt(13), 0) · (x, y) = sqrt(13) x + 0*y = sqrt(13) x. For them to be perpendicular, this must be zero. So, sqrt(13) x = 0 => x = 0. Therefore, point A must be at (0, y) for some y.

So, point A is (0, y), and I is at (0,0), O is at (sqrt(13), 0).

So, point A is on the y-axis. Now, the circumradius is 13, so the circumcircle has center O at (sqrt(13), 0) and radius 13. Therefore, point A lies on the circumcircle, so the distance from O to A must be 13.

Calculating that distance: O is at (sqrt(13), 0), A is at (0, y). So, the distance OA is sqrt[ (sqrt(13) - 0)^2 + (0 - y)^2 ] = sqrt(13 + y² ). This must equal 13.

So, sqrt(13 + y²) = 13 => 13 + y² = 169 => y² = 156 => y = sqrt(156) or y = -sqrt(156). Since y is a coordinate, it can be positive or negative, but since we're dealing with lengths, perhaps we can take y positive. So, y = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

So, point A is at (0, 2√39).

Now, point A is (0, 2√39), I is at (0,0), O is at (√13, 0).

Now, the inradius is 6, which is the radius of the incircle centered at I. The inradius is the distance from I to any side of the triangle.

Wait, but since A is at (0, 2√39), and I is at (0,0), the inradius is 6, so the distance from I to BC is 6.

But wait, I is the inradius, so the inradius is the distance from I to each side.

Hmm, perhaps I can find the coordinates of points B and C.

Wait, but without knowing the other points, this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the sides of the triangle in terms of coordinates.

Wait, but given that I is at (0,0), O is at (√13, 0), and A is at (0, 2√39), perhaps we can find the equations of the sides of the triangle.

But maybe another approach: since we know point A, O, and I, perhaps we can find other properties.

Wait, in this coordinate system, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I to BC is 6. So, the altitude from I to BC is 6. But I is at (0,0), so the equation of BC can be found if we know the distance from I to BC is 6.

But without knowing points B and C, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I can find the equation of BC in terms of the slope.

Let me assume that the equation of BC is y = m x + c. Then, the distance from I (0,0) to BC is |c| / sqrt(m² + 1) = 6.

So, |c| = 6 sqrt(m² + 1).

But I don't know m yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the coordinates of points B and C such that they lie on the circumcircle centered at O (√13, 0) with radius 13.

The circumcircle equation is (x - √13)^2 + y^2 = 13² = 169.

Point A is on this circle, as we found earlier, so plugging (0, 2√39) into the equation:

(0 - √13)^2 + (2√39)^2 = 13 + 4*39 = 13 + 156 = 169. Correct.

So, points B and C also lie on this circle. So, their coordinates (x, y) satisfy (x - √13)^2 + y^2 = 169.

Additionally, since I is the incenter, it must be the intersection of the angle bisectors. Hmm, but with I at (0,0), maybe we can find equations for the angle bisectors.

But perhaps another approach. Let me think about the sides of the triangle.

Wait, in triangle ABC, IA is the segment from inradius I to vertex A. The length of IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's parameters.

I remember that in a triangle, the length of the inradius to a vertex can be given by IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Hmm, actually, the formula for the distance from the inradius to a vertex is IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Or is it IA = 2r / (1 - cos A)?

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for the length of the inradius to the vertex.

Wait, perhaps it's better to derive it.

In triangle ABC, the inradius is r. The incenter is I. The angle at A is α. Then, in triangle AII_A (where I_A is the excenter opposite A), but maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, in triangle AIH, where H is the point where the inradius touches side BC, we have a right triangle.

Wait, the distance from I to BC is r = 6. The distance from I to A is IA, which we can find.

Wait, let me think of triangle AHI, where H is the foot of the perpendicular from I to BC. Then, AI is the hypotenuse, IH is r = 6, and AH is the distance from A to BC.

Wait, but I don't know AH. Hmm.

Alternatively, in triangle AIH, we can use trigonometry. Let θ = angle at I between IA and IH. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to use coordinates. Since I is at (0,0), and point A is at (0, 2√39), then IA is 2√39. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the distance from I (0,0) to A (0, 2√39) is sqrt( (0 - 0)^2 + (2√39 - 0)^2 ) = 2√39. So, IA = 2√39.

Wait, but we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA is along the y-axis, and OI is along the x-axis. So, they're perpendicular.

We also know that the inradius is 6, so the distance from I to BC is 6.

Hmm, so in this coordinate system, point A is at (0, 2√39), I is at (0,0), O is at (√13, 0).

Now, points B and C lie on the circumcircle, whose equation is (x - √13)^2 + y^2 = 169.

Also, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I to BC is 6.

Since the inradius is the distance from I to BC, and I is at (0,0), the equation of BC is y = m x + c, and the distance from (0,0) to this line is |c| / sqrt(m² + 1) = 6. So, |c| = 6 sqrt(m² + 1).

But also, the line BC must pass through points B and C, which are on the circumcircle.

Hmm, so points B and C are on the circumcircle and on the line y = m x + c, with |c| = 6 sqrt(m² + 1).

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe we can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the length of BC, AB, and AC using the coordinates.

Wait, but without knowing points B and C, it's challenging. Maybe we can find the coordinates of B and C by solving the system of equations: the line BC and the circumcircle.

But since I don't know the slope m, this might be difficult.

Wait, but perhaps I can use another property. Since I is the inradius, the coordinates of B and C must satisfy the condition that the distances from I to the sides are equal to the inradius. But I think that's already encapsulated in the line BC being at distance 6 from I.

Wait, maybe another approach: let's consider the formula for the product AB·AC.

Hmm, AB·AC. Wait, in a triangle, AB·AC can be expressed in terms of the sides. Wait, but AB and AC are sides from A, so AB is the length from A to B, AC is the length from A to C.

But without knowing B and C, it's hard to compute. Alternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity that relates AB·AC to other triangle parameters.

Wait, in triangle ABC, AB = c, AC = b, BC = a. Then, the product AB·AC would be b c.

Wait, so I need to find b c, where b and c are the lengths of AC and AB, respectively.

I know that in a triangle, the product b c can be related to the area, semiperimeter, etc.

Wait, area A = r s, where s is semiperimeter. Also, A = (a b c)/(4 R), from the formula involving the circumradius.

So, combining these, r s = (a b c)/(4 R).

Hmm, so if I can find a, b, c, or expressions for them, maybe I can find b c.

But I don't know a, b, c yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that OA = OB = OC = R =13, since they are radii of the circumcircle.

So, points B and C lie on the circumcircle centered at O (√13,0) with radius 13.

Given that, the distances from O to B and O to C are both 13.

Hmm, but we also have that the inradius is 6.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the sides using the formula for inradius: r = (A)/(s), where A is area, s is semiperimeter.

And the area can also be expressed using Heron's formula: A = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)).

But again, without knowing the sides, this might not help directly.

Wait, another approach: in triangle ABC, the distance from A to I is IA = 2√39, as we found earlier.

I also remember that in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the inradius can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.

Wait, in triangle AIH, where H is the point where the incircle touches BC, IH = r = 6, and AH is the distance from A to H.

Wait, but we can relate IA to the angles of the triangle.

Wait, in triangle AIH, IA is the hypotenuse, IH is 6, and angle at H is 90 degrees. Wait, no, that's not necessarily a right triangle. Wait, no, triangle AIH is not necessarily right-angled.

Wait, perhaps I can express IA in terms of the angles.

Wait, another formula: In any triangle, IA = r / sin(A/2). Wait, I think that's correct.

Yes, I found that formula online earlier. So, IA = r / sin(A/2). So, since IA is 2√39 and r is 6, we have:

2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)

So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = (√39)/13 * 3? Wait, no.

Wait, 3 / √39 can be rationalized as 3√39 / 39 = √39 / 13.

Wait, 3 divided by sqrt(39) is equal to sqrt(39)/13 * 3? Wait, let me compute 3 / sqrt(39):

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(39):

3 / sqrt(39) = (3 sqrt(39)) / (sqrt(39)*sqrt(39)) = (3 sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13.

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

So, A/2 = arcsin(sqrt(39)/13).

Hmm, let's compute cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, using the formula for the sides in terms of the angles.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the sides can be expressed as:

a = BC = 2 R sin A

Wait, no, that's the formula for the side opposite angle A: a = 2 R sin A.

Wait, but is that correct? Wait, in the Law of Sines, a / sin A = 2 R.

So, a = 2 R sin A. Similarly, b = 2 R sin B, c = 2 R sin C.

So, yes, a = 2 R sin A, and R is 13, so a = 26 sin A.

Similarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

So, if I can find angles B and C, perhaps I can find sides b and c.

But how?

Wait, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is A + B + C = π.

Also, we have some relations involving the inradius.

Wait, another formula: r = 4 R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).

Hmm, since we know r = 6, R =13, and we have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

So, let's plug in the values:

6 = 4 *13 * sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

So,

6 = 52 * (sqrt(39)/13) * sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

Simplify:

6 = 52 * (sqrt(39)/13) * sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

Simplify 52/13 = 4:

6 = 4 * sqrt(39) * sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

Therefore,

sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 6 / (4 sqrt(39)) = (3)/(2 sqrt(39)) = (3 sqrt(39)) / (2 * 39) )= sqrt(39)/26.

So, sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = sqrt(39)/26.

Hmm, that might be useful.

Additionally, since A + B + C = π, we have (B + C)/2 = (π - A)/2.

So, let me denote D = B/2, E = C/2. Then, D + E = (π - A)/2 = π/2 - A/2.

Thus, E = π/2 - A/2 - D.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since D + E = π/2 - A/2.

So, perhaps we can use product-to-sum identities.

Wait, the product sin D sin E can be expressed as [cos(D - E) - cos(D + E)] / 2.

So, sin D sin E = [cos(D - E) - cos(D + E)] / 2.

But D + E = π/2 - A/2, so cos(D + E) = cos(π/2 - A/2) = sin(A/2).

So, sin D sin E = [cos(D - E) - sin(A/2)] / 2.

Hmm, but I don't know D - E or cos(D - E). So, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express sin(B/2) sin(C/2) in terms of angle A.

Wait, since B + C = π - A, then (B + C)/2 = π/2 - A/2.

Hmm.

Wait, another formula: in triangle ABC, tan(A/2) tan(B/2) + tan(B/2) tan(C/2) + tan(C/2) tan(A/2) = 1.

But I don't know if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the formula for the inradius:

r = (a + b - c)/2 * tan(C/2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of inradius and semiperimeter: A = r s, where s is semiperimeter.

We also have A = (a b c)/(4 R).

So, equating these:

r s = (a b c)/(4 R).

So, 6 s = (a b c)/(4 *13).

Thus,

6 s = (a b c)/52

Therefore,

a b c = 312 s.

But since a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

So, a b c = 26^3 sin A sin B sin C.

So,

26^3 sin A sin B sin C = 312 s.

Hmm, but s is (a + b + c)/2 = (26 sin A + 26 sin B + 26 sin C)/2 = 13 (sin A + sin B + sin C).

So,

26^3 sin A sin B sin C = 312 * 13 (sin A + sin B + sin C)

Simplify:

26^3 = 26 * 26 * 26 = 17,576

312 *13 = 4056

So,

17,576 sin A sin B sin C = 4056 (sin A + sin B + sin C)

Divide both sides by 4056:

17,576 / 4056 = (4056 / 4056) * (sin A sin B sin C) / (sin A + sin B + sin C)

Wait, 17,576 / 4056 = let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4:

17,576 /4 =4394; 4056 /4 = 1014.

Again, divide by 2:

4394 /2=2197; 1014 /2=507.

Hmm, 2197 is 13^3, and 507 is 13*39=13*13*3=13²*3.

So,

2197 / 507 = (13^3)/(13^2 *3) )= 13/3.

So, 17,576 /4056 =13/3.

Thus,

13/3 sin A sin B sin C = sin A + sin B + sin C.

Hmm, that's an equation involving sines of the angles.

But I still don't know how to solve this. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the product AB·AC = c b.

Wait, but c = AB, b = AC.

Wait, but with A at (0, 2√39), I at (0,0), O at (√13, 0), and points B and C on the circumcircle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute AB and AC using coordinates.

Wait, point A is (0, 2√39). Points B and C are on the circumcircle (x - √13)^2 + y^2 = 169.

But I don't know their exact coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize points B and C.

Let me think: suppose point B is at (√13 + 13 cos θ, 13 sin θ), and point C is at (√13 + 13 cos φ, 13 sin φ).

But this seems complicated, as I don't know θ and φ.

But perhaps I can use the fact that the inradius is 6. The inradius is the distance from I to BC, which is 6.

So, the distance from (0,0) to the line BC is 6.

The line BC passes through points B and C, which are (√13 + 13 cos θ, 13 sin θ) and (√13 + 13 cos φ, 13 sin φ).

The equation of line BC can be found using two-point form.

But this might get too messy. Maybe another approach is better.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the area in two ways.

The area A can be expressed as r s = 6 s.

Also, area A can be expressed as (1/2) * AB * AC * sin A.

Wait, because in triangle ABC, the area is (1/2)ab sin C, so similarly, A = (1/2) AB AC sin A.

So,

6 s = (1/2) AB AC sin A

So,

AB AC sin A = 12 s

But AB is c, AC is b, so BC is a.

Wait, sorry, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.

So, the area is (1/2) b c sin A.

So,

6 s = (1/2) b c sin A

Thus,

b c sin A = 12 s.

Hmm, but s = (a + b + c)/2.

So,

b c sin A = 12 (a + b + c)/2 = 6(a + b + c)

So,

b c sin A = 6(a + b + c)

But I don't know a, b, c.

Wait, but we also know that a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

So,

b c sin A = 6(a + b + c)

Substituting:

(26 sin B)(26 sin C) sin A = 6(26 sin A + 26 sin B + 26 sin C)

Simplify:

676 sin A sin B sin C = 6*26 (sin A + sin B + sin C)

676 sin A sin B sin C = 156 (sin A + sin B + sin C)

Divide both sides by 52:

13 sin A sin B sin C = 3 (sin A + sin B + sin C)

Hmm, that's a similar equation to the one I had earlier.

Wait, earlier I had 13/3 sin A sin B sin C = sin A + sin B + sin C.

Wait, that equation is:

13/3 sin A sin B sin C = sin A + sin B + sin C.

Wait, but now, this equation is:

13 sin A sin B sin C = 3 (sin A + sin B + sin C)

Wait, so:

13 sin A sin B sin C = 3 (sin A + sin B + sin C)

Wait, but that seems different from the earlier equation. Wait, let me check the calculations.

Earlier, when I equated r s = (a b c)/(4 R):

r s = (a b c)/(4 R) → 6 s = (a b c)/(4*13) → a b c = 6*52 s = 312 s.

Since a =26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C,

a b c =26^3 sin A sin B sin C = 312 s.

But s = (a + b + c)/2 =13 (sin A + sin B + sin C).

So,

26^3 sin A sin B sin C = 312 *13 (sin A + sin B + sin C).

26^3 =17,576.

312 *13 = 4056.

So,

17,576 sin A sin B sin C =4056 (sin A + sin B + sin C).

Divide both sides by 4056:

17,576 /4056 = (sin A sin B sin C)/(sin A + sin B + sin C).

17,576 /4056 = let's compute:

17,576 ÷4056= approximately 4.333... which is 13/3.

Yes, as before, 17,576 /4056=13/3.

So,

13/3 sin A sin B sin C = sin A + sin B + sin C.

So, this is the equation I have.

But I also have another equation from the inradius formula involving sin(B/2) sin(C/2):

sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = sqrt(39)/26.

So, perhaps I can find a relation between angles B and C.

Wait, let me denote x = B/2, y = C/2.

So, x + y = (π - A)/2.

From the earlier equation, sin x sin y = sqrt(39)/26.

Also, x + y = π/2 - A/2.

We know sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, so A/2 = arcsin(sqrt(39)/13).

So, x + y = π/2 - arcsin(sqrt(39)/13).

Hmm.

Let me compute cos(x + y) = cos(π/2 - A/2) = sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Also, using the identity:

sin x sin y = [cos(x - y) - cos(x + y)] / 2.

We have sin x sin y = sqrt(39)/26.

So,

sqrt(39)/26 = [cos(x - y) - sqrt(39)/13]/2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

2*sqrt(39)/26 = cos(x - y) - sqrt(39)/13.

Simplify:

sqrt(39)/13 = cos(x - y) - sqrt(39)/13.

Thus,

cos(x - y) = sqrt(39)/13 + sqrt(39)/13 = 2 sqrt(39)/13.

So,

cos(x - y) = 2 sqrt(39)/13.

Hmm, so cos(x - y) = 2 sqrt(39)/13.

But we also have x + y = π/2 - A/2, and we know sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169)=sqrt(130)/13.

So, cos(x + y) = sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

So, x + y = some angle whose cosine is sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, but maybe using the sum and difference formulas.

Let me denote x + y = S, x - y = D.

So, S = x + y = π/2 - A/2.

D = x - y.

We have:

cos D = 2 sqrt(39)/13.

And,

cos S = sqrt(39)/13.

We also know that:

sin S = sin(π/2 - A/2) = cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

So, now, we can find sin D.

Using the identity:

sin D = sqrt(1 - cos² D) = sqrt(1 - (4*39)/(169)) = sqrt( (169 - 156)/169 ) = sqrt(13/169) = sqrt(13)/13.

So, sin D = sqrt(13)/13.

Now, using the sine addition formula:

sin(x + y) = sin S = sin(π/2 - A/2) = cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

But also, sin(x + y) = sin x cos y + cos x sin y.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find expressions for sin x and sin y.

Wait, since x + y = S and x - y = D,

x = (S + D)/2,

y = (S - D)/2.

So,

sin x = sin[(S + D)/2],

sin y = sin[(S - D)/2].

But this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the product sin x sin y.

Wait, sin x sin y = [cos(x - y) - cos(x + y)] / 2 = [cos D - cos S]/2.

We already have cos D = 2 sqrt(39)/13, cos S = sqrt(39)/13.

So,

sin x sin y = [ (2 sqrt(39)/13) - (sqrt(39)/13) ] / 2 = (sqrt(39)/13)/2 = sqrt(39)/(26).

Which matches the earlier result, so no new information.

Hmm, perhaps I can express sin B and sin C in terms of x and y.

Wait, B = 2x, C=2y.

So, sin B = 2 sin x cos x,

sin C = 2 sin y cos y.

So, sin B sin C = 4 sin x cos x sin y cos y = (sin 2x)(sin 2y).

But maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express sin B + sin C.

Wait, using sum to product:

sin B + sin C = 2 sin[(B + C)/2] cos[(B - C)/2] = 2 sin[(π - A)/2] cos(D).

Since B + C = π - A, so (B + C)/2 = (π - A)/2.

We know that sin[(π - A)/2] = sin(π/2 - A/2) = cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

And cos(D) = cos(x - y) = 2 sqrt(39)/13.

So,

sin B + sin C = 2 * (sqrt(130)/13) * (2 sqrt(39)/13) = 4 sqrt(130*39) / (13*13).

Wait, sqrt(130*39) = sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 factors: 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 *13².

So, sqrt(5070) = 13 sqrt(30).

Wait,

sqrt(130 *39) = sqrt(130 * 39) = sqrt( (13 *10) * (13 *3) ) = sqrt(13² * 30) )= 13 sqrt(30).

So,

sin B + sin C = 4 * (13 sqrt(30)) / (13²) )= (4 sqrt(30))/13.

So,

sin B + sin C = 4 sqrt(30)/13.

Hmm, that's a useful result.

So, going back to the equation:

13 sin A sin B sin C = 3 (sin A + sin B + sin C )

We can write this as:

13 sin A sin B sin C = 3 sin A + 3 sin B + 3 sin C.

We know sin B + sin C = 4 sqrt(30)/13.

So,

13 sin A sin B sin C = 3 sin A + 3*(4 sqrt(30)/13).

Hmm, but we also need sin B sin C.

Wait, let's compute sin B sin C.

Since sin B = 2 sin x cos x,

sin C = 2 sin y cos y,

so,

sin B sin C = 4 sin x cos x sin y cos y = (sin 2x)(sin 2y).

But 2x = B, 2y = C,

so,

sin B sin C = sin B sin C.

Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.

We have B + C = π - A,

so,

cos(B + C) = cos(π - A) = -cos A.

Also, cos(B - C) = cos(2x - 2y) = cos(2(x - y)) = cos(2D).

We have D = x - y,

so, cos(2D) = 2 cos² D -1 = 2*(4*39/169) - 1 = 8*39/169 -1 = (312 - 169)/169 = 143/169.

So,

cos(B - C) = 143/169.

Thus,

sin B sin C = [143/169 - (-cos A)] / 2.

But we need cos A.

Using the formula cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2).

We have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13,

so,

sin²(A/2) = 39/169,

so,

cos A = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169.

So,

cos A = 91/169.

Therefore,

sin B sin C = [143/169 - (-91/169)] / 2 = [143 +91)/169 ] /2 = (234/169)/2 = 117/169 = 9*13 / 169 = 9/13.

So,

sin B sin C = 9/13.

Hmm, that's helpful.

So, sin B sin C = 9/13.

Now, going back to the equation:

13 sin A sin B sin C = 3 sin A + 3 sin B + 3 sin C.

We know sin B + sin C = 4 sqrt(30)/13.

So,

13 sin A * (9/13) = 3 sin A + 3*(4 sqrt(30)/13).

Simplify:

sin A * 9 = 3 sin A + 12 sqrt(30)/13.

So,

9 sin A - 3 sin A = 12 sqrt(30)/13.

6 sin A = 12 sqrt(30)/13.

Thus,

sin A = (12 sqrt(30)/13) /6 = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

Great, now we have sin A.

From sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, we can find cos A.

cos A = sqrt(1 - sin² A) = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169) = sqrt(1 - 120/169) = sqrt(49/169) =7/13.

So, cos A =7/13.

Now, we can find sin A sin B sin C.

We have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13,

sin B sin C =9/13.

So,

sin A sin B sin C = (2 sqrt(30)/13) * (9/13) = (18 sqrt(30))/169.

Now, let's go back to the equation:

13 sin A sin B sin C =3 sin A +3 sin B +3 sin C.

We have:

13*(18 sqrt(30)/169) =3*(2 sqrt(30)/13) +3*(4 sqrt(30)/13).

Simplify left side:

(234 sqrt(30))/169 = (6 sqrt(30))/13 + (12 sqrt(30))/13.

Compute right side:

(6 sqrt(30) +12 sqrt(30))/13 = 18 sqrt(30)/13.

So,

Left side: 234 sqrt(30)/169 = (18 sqrt(30))/13.

Which is correct because 234/169 = (18*13)/169= 234/169= 18/13.

So, the equation holds. Good.

Now, let's get back to our main goal: finding AB·AC = b c.

From earlier, we have:

6 s = (1/2) b c sin A → b c sin A =12 s.

So, b c = (12 s)/ sin A.

We have sin A =2 sqrt(30)/13.

So,

b c = (12 s) / (2 sqrt(30)/13 )= (12 s *13)/(2 sqrt(30))= (156 s)/(2 sqrt(30))=78 s / sqrt(30).

So,

b c =78 s / sqrt(30).

But we need to find s, the semiperimeter.

Recall that s = (a + b + c)/2.

But a =26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

So,

s= (26 sin A +26 sin B +26 sin C)/2=13 (sin A + sin B + sin C).

We already know sin A =2 sqrt(30)/13,

sin B + sin C =4 sqrt(30)/13.

So,

sin A + sin B + sin C= 2 sqrt(30)/13 +4 sqrt(30)/13=6 sqrt(30)/13.

Thus,

s=13*(6 sqrt(30)/13)=6 sqrt(30).

So, s=6 sqrt(30).

Therefore,

b c=78 *6 sqrt(30)/ sqrt(30)=78*6=468.

Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait,

b c=78 s / sqrt(30).

s=6 sqrt(30).

So,

b c =78 *6 sqrt(30)/sqrt(30)=78*6=468.

Yes, because sqrt(30) cancels out.

So, AB·AC =468.

Therefore, the answer is 468.


To solve the problem, we start by noting the given conditions: the circumradius \( R = 13 \), inradius \( r = 6 \), and \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). 

First, we calculate the distance \( OI \) using the formula:
\[
OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr = 13^2 - 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \implies OI = \sqrt{13}.
\]
Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we place the incenter \( I \) at the origin \((0,0)\) and the circumcenter \( O \) at \((\sqrt{13}, 0)\). Point \( A \) lies on the y-axis at \((0, y)\) because \( IA \) is perpendicular to \( OI \).

The distance from \( O \) to \( A \) is the circumradius:
\[
\sqrt{(\sqrt{13} - 0)^2 + (0 - y)^2} = 13 \implies 13 + y^2 = 169 \implies y^2 = 156 \implies y = 2\sqrt{39}.
\]
Thus, \( A \) is at \((0, 2\sqrt{39})\).

Next, we use the inradius formula \( r = \frac{A}{s} \) and the area formula \( A = \frac{abc}{4R} \). Combining these, we get:
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 13} \implies abc = 312s.
\]
Expressing sides \( a, b, c \) in terms of angles:
\[
a = 26 \sin A, \quad b = 26 \sin B, \quad c = 26 \sin C.
\]
Thus, \( abc = 26^3 \sin A \sin B \sin C \). Substituting into the earlier equation:
\[
26^3 \sin A \sin B \sin C = 312s \implies s = \frac{26^3 \sin A \sin B \sin C}{312}.
\]
We also find \( \sin(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \) and \( \cos(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} \). Using these, we calculate \( \sin A = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \) and \( \cos A = \frac{7}{13} \).

Using the area formula \( A = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A \) and \( A = 6s \), we find:
\[
6s = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A \implies bc = \frac{12s}{\sin A}.
\]
Substituting \( s = 6\sqrt{30} \) and \( \sin A = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \):
\[
bc = \frac{12 \cdot 6\sqrt{30}}{\frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}} = 78 \cdot 6 = 468.
\]
Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = 468 \).

\[
\boxed{468}
\]
