Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. It says: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z], where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number z with |z| = 4 can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, right? Because the modulus is 4, so in polar form, it's 4 times e to the i times some angle θ. So maybe I can represent z as 4e^{iθ} for some θ.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to write z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Either way, both forms should be okay. But since I might need to compute real parts later, perhaps using cos and sin terms would be helpful.

So, substituting z into the expression, let's see: Let me rewrite the expression first.

Expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since |z| = 4, then 1/z is (1/z) = conjugate(z)/|z|^2. Because for any complex number z = a + bi, 1/z = (a - bi)/(a² + b²). And since |z|² = 16 here, so 1/z = conjugate(z)/16.

So, 1/z = (z̄)/16.

So, (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(z̄)/16.

Let me compute that: 96/16 is 6, 144/16 is 9. So, it's 6*(96/16 is 6, 144/16 is 9) so 6 + 9i multiplied by z̄.

Wait, that's 6*(96/16) and 9*(144/16)? Wait no, that's not right. Let me think again. Wait, (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(z̄)/16. So that's (96 + 144i)*(z̄)/16. Which can be written as (96/16 + 144i/16) * z̄. So 96/16 is 6, 144/16 is 9. So it becomes (6 + 9i) * z̄.

So now, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)*z + (6 + 9i)*z̄.

Hmm, okay. So now, we can write the entire expression in terms of z and z̄.

Let me write that: (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)z̄.

Since z is a complex number with |z|=4, I can express z in terms of θ as 4e^{iθ}, and then z̄ would be 4e^{-iθ}.

So substituting z = 4e^{iθ} and z̄ = 4e^{-iθ}, let's plug these into the expression.

So, (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} + (6 + 9i)*4e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i) * e^{iθ}.

Similarly, second term: (6 + 9i)*4e^{-iθ} = 4*(6 + 9i) * e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression is:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + 4*(6 + 9i)*e^{-iθ}.

Let me factor out the 4:

4 [ (75 + 117i) e^{iθ} + (6 + 9i) e^{-iθ} } ].

Hmm, but maybe I can write this as 4 times [ (75 + 117i) e^{iθ} + (6 + 9i) e^{-iθ} ].

Now, perhaps I can combine these terms by expressing them in terms of sine and cosine, since e^{iθ} is cosθ + i sinθ.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of this expression in terms of real and imaginary parts.

Wait, but since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, perhaps we can compute the real part of each term and sum them up.

So, let me denote the expression as E = 4 [ (75 + 117i) e^{iθ} + (6 + 9i) e^{-iθ} } ].

So, the real part of E is 4 times the real part of [ (75 + 117i) e^{iθ} + (6 + 9i) e^{-iθ} } ].

Let me compute Re[(75 + 117i) e^{iθ}] + Re[(6 + 9i) e^{-iθ} ].

Wait, because Re(A + B) = Re(A) + Re(B).

So, let me compute each Re separately.

First term: Re[(75 + 117i) e^{iθ}].

I can write this as Re[ (75 + 117i) (cosθ + i sinθ) ].

Multiplying out, (75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 75 cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ -117 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 75 cosθ - 117 sinθ.

Imaginary part: 75 sinθ + 117 cosθ.

So, Re[(75 + 117i) e^{iθ}] = 75 cosθ - 117 sinθ.

Similarly, for the second term, Re[(6 + 9i) e^{-iθ}].

So, let's compute that.

e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, (6 + 9i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 6 cosθ - 6i sinθ + 9i cosθ -9i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so this becomes 6 cosθ -6i sinθ +9i cosθ +9 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 6 cosθ +9 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (-6 sinθ +9 cosθ)i.

So, Re[(6 + 9i) e^{-iθ}] = 6 cosθ +9 sinθ.

So, putting it all together, the real part of the entire expression E is:

4 [ (75 cosθ -117 sinθ) + (6 cosθ +9 sinθ) ) ].

Let me simplify inside the brackets:

(75 cosθ +6 cosθ) + (-117 sinθ +9 sinθ) = 81 cosθ -108 sinθ.

So, the real part is 4*(81 cosθ -108 sinθ) = 4*(81 cosθ -108 sinθ).

We can factor 27 out from the terms inside the parentheses: 81 is 27*3, 108 is 27*4.

So, 81 cosθ -108 sinθ = 27*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ).

Thus, the real part becomes 4*27*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ) = 108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ).

So now, our problem reduces to finding the maximum of 108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ).

But wait, 3 cosθ -4 sinθ can be written as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2) = 5. Because the identity says a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²) and tanφ = b/a. Wait, but in this case, it's 3 cosθ -4 sinθ, which is 3 cosθ + (-4) sinθ, so a =3, b= -4.

So, R = sqrt(3² + (-4)^2) = sqrt(9 +16) = sqrt(25) =5.

So, 3 cosθ -4 sinθ =5 cos(theta + phi), where phi is such that cos phi = 3/R =3/5, and sin phi = -4/R = -4/5.

Wait, wait, the identity is a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(theta - phi), where R= sqrt(a² + b²), cos phi = a/R, sin phi = b/R.

Wait, but in our case, the expression is 3 cosθ -4 sinθ =3 cosθ + (-4) sinθ. So a=3, b=-4.

So, R=5, cos phi = a/R =3/5, sin phi = b/R = -4/5.

So, phi is in the fourth quadrant, since cos is positive and sin is negative.

So, 3 cosθ -4 sinθ =5 cos(theta - phi).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the identity is a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(theta - phi).

Wait, but in our case, it's a cosθ + b sinθ, where b is negative. So, I think it's correct.

So
