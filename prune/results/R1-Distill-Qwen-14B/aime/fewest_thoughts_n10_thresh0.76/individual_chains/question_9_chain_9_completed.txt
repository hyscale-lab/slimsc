Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write down what I know.

First, I remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So I can translate these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm property that log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a), this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, that's the same as log_x(y^x) = 10. Alternatively, if I use the definition, it's equivalent to x^(10) = y^x. Okay, that might be a better way to write it. So, x^10 = y^x. Got that.

Now the second equation: log_y(x^(4y)) = 10. Again, applying the same property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Alternatively, writing it as exponential form: y^10 = x^(4y). Hmm, that's the second equation.

So now I have two equations:
1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^(4y)

I need to find xy. Hmm, maybe I can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute into the second.

Looking at equation 1: x^10 = y^x. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier to handle. Taking ln, we get ln(x^10) = ln(y^x). Which simplifies to 10 ln x = x ln y. So, 10 ln x = x ln y. Let me rearrange that: ln y = (10 ln x)/x. So, y = e^{(10 ln x)/x}. Hmm, that's one expression for y in terms of x.

Let me see equation 2: y^10 = x^(4y). Let's take the natural logarithm here as well. ln(y^10) = ln(x^(4y)) => 10 ln y = 4y ln x. 

Wait a second, from equation 1 we have ln y in terms of ln x. So maybe I can substitute that here. From equation 1, ln y = (10 ln x)/x. Let's plug that into equation 2's transformed equation.

So equation 2 becomes: 10 * (10 ln x)/x = 4y ln x. Let me write that out: 10*(10 ln x)/x = 4y ln x. Simplify the left side: (100 ln x)/x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, so I can divide both sides by ln x, assuming ln x isn't zero, which it can't be since x > 1, so ln x is positive. So, 100/x = 4y. Let's solve for y here. Multiplying both sides by x gives 100 = 4y x. So, 4xy = 100. Divide both sides by 4: xy = 25. 

Wait, is that it? So xy is 25? That seems straightforward. But wait, maybe I should check if this is consistent with the original equations.

Let me verify. If xy = 25, then y = 25/x. Let's substitute y = 25/x into the first equation: x^10 = y^x = (25/x)^x. So, x^10 = (25^x)/(x^x). Let's rearrange: x^10 * x^x = 25^x. So, x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Hmm, taking both sides to the power of 1/x: x^{(10 + x)/x} = 25. Let me simplify the exponent: (10 + x)/x = 1 + 10/x. So, x^{1 + 10/x} = 25.

Let me write this as x * x^{10/x} = 25. Let me set t = x^{10/x}. So, the equation becomes x * t = 25.

Wait, but I also know from the first substitution that y = 25/x, so perhaps I can find another relation involving t.

Alternatively, maybe take the natural log of both sides again. So starting from x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Take ln: (1 + 10/x) ln x = ln 25.

Hmm, let's denote u = ln x. Then, (1 + 10/x) u = ln 25. But 10/x is 10/u * because x = e^u? Wait, no, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, let me express 1 + 10/x as (x +10)/x. So, ((x +10)/x) * ln x = ln 25.

So, (x + 10) ln x = x ln 25.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have a straightforward algebraic solution. Maybe I can find a value of x that satisfies this?

Wait, perhaps x is 5? Let me try x=5. Let's plug into the equation: (5 +10) ln 5 =5 ln 25. The left side is 15 ln5, right side is 5 ln25. Since 25 is 5^2, ln25=2 ln5. So right side is 5*(2 ln5) =10 ln5. Left side is 15 ln5. 15 ln5 ≠ 10 ln5. So x=5 doesn't work.

How about x=2? Left side: (2+10) ln2 =12 ln2≈12*0.693≈8.316. Right side: 2 ln25≈2*3.218≈6.436. Not equal.

x=4: (4+10) ln4=14 ln4≈14*1.386≈19.404. Right side:4 ln25≈4*3.218≈12.873. Not equal.

x= sqrt(25)=5, but that didn't work. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, from equation 1, we have x^10 = y^x, and from equation 2, y^10 = x^(4y). Since we found xy=25, perhaps we can find x and y individually.

But wait, the question only asks for xy, so maybe there's a way to find xy without finding each individually. But I thought I found that xy=25 earlier, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when I substituted back, the equation didn't hold for x=5 or 2 or 4.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back.

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Equation 2: y^10 = x^(4y).

We found that 100/x =4y, which gives y=25/(x), right? Wait, 100/x =4y, so y=25/x.

But if xy=25, then substituting y=25/x is correct. So that result is correct. Then, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution back into equation 1.

Wait, perhaps I should use y=25/x in equation 1: x^10 = y^x = (25/x)^x.

So x^10 = (25^x)/(x^x).

So multiplying both sides by x^x: x^{10 +x} =25^x.

Which can be written as (x^{(10 +x)/x}) =25.

Let me compute (10 +x)/x =1 +10/x.

So, x^{1 +10/x}=25.

But 1 +10/x = (x +10)/x. Wait, perhaps if I let t =x^{1/x}, then x^{1 +10/x} =x*(x^{10/x})=x*(t^10).

So, x*(t^10)=25.

But t= x^{1/x}, so t is equal to e^{(ln x)/x}.

Hmm, not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps take both sides to the power of 1/(1+10/x):

x =25^{1/(1 +10/x)}.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, maybe take the natural log of both sides again.

From x^{1 +10/x}=25,

Take ln: (1 +10/x) ln x = ln25.

Let me write this as (x +10)/x * ln x = ln25.

Multiply both sides by x: (x +10) ln x = x ln25.

Hmm, perhaps let me rearrange terms:

(x +10) ln x -x ln25=0.

Let me factor out x: x (ln x - ln25) +10 ln x =0.

Which is x ln(x/25) +10 ln x =0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe try to see if x=5 works again.

x=5: 5 ln(5/25) +10 ln5=5 ln(1/5)+10 ln5=5*(-ln5)+10 ln5= (-5 ln5 +10 ln5)=5 ln5≈5*1.609≈8.045, which is not zero. So x=5 doesn't work.

x=25: Let's try x=25. Then (25 +10) ln25 =35 ln25. RHS x ln25=25 ln25. So LHS 35 ln25, RHS 25 ln25. Not equal.

x= sqrt(25)=5, but that didn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps x= something else. Let me try x=10.

x=10: (10 +10) ln10=20 ln10≈20*2.302≈46.04. RHS:10 ln25≈10*3.218≈32.18. Not equal.

Hmm, perhaps this suggests that my earlier conclusion that xy=25 is correct, but that the individual values of x and y don't satisfy the equation? That can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's go back. From equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

We can write equation 1 as y = x^{10/x}.

Substitute this into equation 2:

(x^{10/x})^{10} =x^{4y}.

Simplify left side: x^{100/x} = x^{4y}.

Since the bases are same and x>1, the exponents must be equal: 100/x =4y.

Which gives y=25/x. So that's consistent with what we had earlier.

So, then, we have y=25/x, and from equation 1, y=x^{10/x}.

So, 25/x =x^{10/x}.

Let me write this equation: 25/x =x^{10/x}.

Let me take natural log: ln(25/x) = (10/x) ln x.

So, ln25 -lnx = (10/x) lnx.

Multiply both sides by x: x ln25 -x lnx =10 lnx.

Rearranged: x ln25 =x lnx +10 lnx.

Factor out lnx on the right: x ln25 = lnx (x +10).

So, lnx = (x ln25)/(x +10).

Hmm, so lnx = (x ln25)/(x +10).

This still looks tricky. Maybe I can let z= x +10, but not sure.

Alternatively, let me consider that lnx = (x ln25)/(x +10).

Let me write this as lnx = [ln25 *x]/(x +10).

Hmm, perhaps let me set t =x/(x +10). Then, x = t (x +10). Hmm, but that might not help.

Alternatively, think of it as lnx = k * [x/(x +10)], where k=ln25.

Not sure. Alternatively, maybe guess a value for x that satisfies this.

Wait, let me think, can x and y be the same? If x=y, then what?

If x=y, then from equation 1: x^10 =x^x =>x^{x-10}=1. Since x>1, x-10=0 =>x=10. So x=10, y=10.

Let me check in equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y} =>10^10=10^{40}? No, 10^10 is not equal to 10^40. So x=y is not a solution.

Hmm, okay, that doesn't work.

So maybe x and y are different. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, from equation 1: y= x^{10/x}.

From equation 2, as we saw, y=25/x.

So, set x^{10/x}=25/x.

So, x^{10/x} *x =25.

Which is x^{(10/x)+1}=25.

But (10/x)+1 = (10 +x)/x.

So, x^{(10+x)/x}=25.

Which is x^{(10 +x)/x}=25.

Wait, that's the same as what we had earlier. So perhaps I can write this as x^{(x +10)/x}=25.

Let me write this as (x^{1/x})^{x +10}=25.

But x^{1/x} is a function that decreases as x increases beyond e. Hmm, perhaps trying x=25.

Wait, x=25: (25^{1/25})^{25 +10}=25^{(35/25)}=25^{7/5}= (5^2)^{7/5}=5^{14/5}≈5^{2.8}≈ 5^2 *5^0.8≈25*3.311≈82.78, which is not 25. So no.

x=10: (10^{1/10})^{20}=10^{2}=100≠25.

x=5: (5^{1/5})^{15}=5^3=125≠25.

x= sqrt(25)=5, already tried.

Wait, perhaps x= something else. Let me try x= something where x^{1/x} is a square root or something.

Wait, 25=5^2. Maybe x^{(x+10)/x}=5^2.

So, perhaps x^{(x+10)/x}=5^2.

Let me write (x^{1/x})^{x+10}=5^2.

So, (x^{1/x})^{x+10}=25.

Hmm, but I don't know x.

Alternatively, take both sides to the power of x/(x+10):

x=25^{x/(x +10)}.

Hmm, taking natural log: lnx= (x ln25)/(x +10).

Wait, that's the same as the equation I had earlier.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Maybe I can let me denote f(x)=lnx - (x ln25)/(x+10). Then, I can try to solve f(x)=0.

Looking for x>1 where f(x)=0.

Let me try x=5:

f(5)=ln5 - (5 ln25)/(15)=ln5 - (5 * 2 ln5)/15 = ln5 - (10 ln5)/15= ln5 - (2 ln5)/3= (1/3) ln5≈0.597>0.

x=10:

f(10)=ln10 - (10 ln25)/(20)=ln10 - (10 * 2 ln5)/20= ln10 - (20 ln5)/20= ln10 - ln5= ln(10/5)=ln2≈0.693>0.

x=15:

f(15)=ln15 - (15 ln25)/(25)=ln15 - (15 * 2 ln5)/25= ln15 - (30 ln5)/25= ln15 - (6/5 ln5).

Compute numerically: ln15≈2.708, ln5≈1.609.

So, 6/5 *1.609≈1.931.

So, 2.708 -1.931≈0.777>0.

x=20:

f(20)=ln20 - (20 ln25)/30= ln20 - (20*2 ln5)/30= ln20 - (40 ln5)/30= ln20 - (4/3 ln5).

Compute: ln20≈2.996, 4/3 *1.609≈2.145.

2.996 -2.145≈0.851>0.

Hmm, f(x) is positive here. What about x=25:

f(25)=ln25 - (25 ln25)/35= ln25(1 -25/35)= ln25*(10/35)= ln25*(2/7).

Which is positive since ln25>0.

Wait, so f(x)=0 requires x where lnx is less than (x ln25)/(x+10). But when x=5, f(x) is positive; when x increases, f(x) remains positive. Hmm, so maybe x is less than 5?

Wait, let's try x=2:

f(2)=ln2 - (2 ln25)/(12)=0.693 - (2*3.218)/12≈0.693 - (6.436)/12≈0.693 -0.536≈0.157>0.

x=3:

f(3)=ln3 - (3 ln25)/13≈1.0986 - (3*3.218)/13≈1.0986 -9.654/13≈1.0986 -0.742≈0.356>0.

x=4:

f(4)=ln4 - (4 ln25)/14≈1.386 - (4*3.218)/14≈1.386 -12.872/14≈1.386 -0.919≈0.467>0.

Hmm, all x>1, f(x) is positive. But wait, when x approaches 1 from above, what happens?

As x→1+, ln x approaches 0, and (x ln25)/(x+10) approaches (ln25)/11≈3.218/11≈0.292. So, f(x) approaches 0 -0.292= -0.292. So, f(x) approaches -0.292 as x→1+.

So, f(x) is negative near x=1, and positive for x>1 tested. So, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a solution between x=1 and x=2.

Wait, but earlier at x=2, f(x)=0.157>0. So, the function crosses zero somewhere between x=1 and x=2. But earlier, when I tried x=1.5, f(x) is positive. Wait, let me compute f(1.5):

x=1.5: f(1.5)=ln1.5 - (1.5 ln25)/11.5≈0.4055 - (1.5*3.218)/11.5≈0.4055 -4.827/11.5≈0.4055 -0.419≈-0.0135.

So, f(1.5)≈-0.0135, which is negative.

So, between x=1.5 and x=2, f(x) goes from -0.0135 to +0.157. So, by IVT, there is a root between 1.5 and 2.

Similarly, let's compute f(1.6):

x=1.6:

f(1.6)=ln1.6≈0.4700 - (1.6*3.218)/11.6≈0.4700 -5.1488/11.6≈0.4700 -0.4439≈0.0261>0.

So, f(1.6)=~0.0261.

So, crossing zero between 1.5 and 1.6.

Using linear approximation:

At x=1.5, f=-0.0135; x=1.6, f=0.0261.

The change in x is 0.1, change in f is ~0.04. So, to reach f=0 from x=1.5, need delta_x where (-0.0135 + delta_x * (0.04/0.1))=0.

So, delta_x= (0.0135)/(0.04/0.1)= (0.0135)/(0.4)=0.03375.

So, x≈1.5 +0.03375≈1.53375.

Let me compute f(1.53375):

ln(1.53375)≈0.4263.

Compute (1.53375 *3.218)/(1.53375 +10)= (4.936)/11.53375≈0.428.

So, f(x)=0.4263 -0.428≈-0.0017.

Hmm, that's still negative. So, maybe a bit higher.

Next, try x=1.54:

ln(1.54)≈0.433.

Compute (1.54 *3.218)/(1.54 +10)= (4.954)/11.54≈0.429.

f(x)=0.433 -0.429≈0.004>0.

So, between x=1.53375 and x=1.54.

Using linear approx again:

At x=1.53375, f≈-0.0017; x=1.54, f≈0.004.

Change in x=0.00625, change in f=0.0057.

To reach f=0 from x=1.53375, need delta_x= (0.0017)/(0.0057/0.00625)= (0.0017)/0.912≈0.00186.

So, x≈1.53375 +0.00186≈1.5356.

Compute f(1.5356):

ln(1.5356)≈0.429.

Compute (1.5356 *3.218)/(1.5356 +10)= (4.942)/11.5356≈0.4284.

So, f(x)=0.429 -0.4284≈0.0006>0.

Almost zero. So, x≈1.535.

So, x≈1.535. Then, y=25/x≈25/1.535≈16.29.

Wait, but the problem says x and y are greater than 1, which they are.

So, even though the individual x and y are approximately 1.535 and 16.29, their product is indeed 25.

So, despite having to solve a transcendental equation for x, the product xy=25 holds.

Therefore, the answer is 25.


To solve the problem, we start by translating the given logarithmic equations into exponential form. 

1. From $\log_x(y^x) = 10$, we have $x^{10} = y^x$.
2. From $\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10$, we have $y^{10} = x^{4y}$.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the first equation gives $10 \ln x = x \ln y$, which simplifies to $\ln y = \frac{10 \ln x}{x}$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $10 \cdot \frac{10 \ln x}{x} = 4y \ln x$. Simplifying further, we find $\frac{100}{x} = 4y$, leading to $y = \frac{25}{x}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{25}{x}$ into the first equation, we have $x^{10} = \left(\frac{25}{x}\right)^x$. Simplifying this gives $x^{10 + x} = 25^x$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging terms confirms that $xy = 25$.

Thus, the product $xy$ is $\boxed{25}$.
