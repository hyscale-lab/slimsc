Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. I'm given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. I need to find the length AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let's jot down what I know.

First, triangle ABC has sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Let me check if this is a valid triangle. The sum of AB and BC is 5 + 9 =14, which is greater than AC=10. Similarly, other sides also satisfy the triangle inequality, so that's good.

Since ABC is inscribed in circle ω, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something related to triangle ABC? Wait, no. The point where the two tangents meet is called the ex-similicenter or something like that. Alternatively, in some contexts, it's called the symmedian point? Hmm, not exactly sure. Maybe I should think about the properties of tangents and power of a point.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: since D lies on the tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = (length of tangent)^2. That might come in handy.

Also, since AD intersects ω again at P, AP is the length from A to P. So, if I can find the length from A to where AD meets the circle again, that's AP. Perhaps using power of a point or some intersecting chord theorem?

Wait, power of point A with respect to ω: but A is on ω, so the power is zero. Hmm, maybe not directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem?

Alternatively, maybe using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts since we have tangents and intersections.

Wait, perhaps inversion could be useful here, but I'm not very familiar with inversion techniques. Maybe I should try coordinate geometry? But that might get messy with the given side lengths.

Wait, let me think about the properties of point D. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, triangle BDC is an isosceles triangle? Because the two tangents from D to ω are equal in length, so DB = DC.

So, DB = DC. That might be useful.

Also, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, line BD is tangent at B, so angle ABD is equal to angle ACB. Wait, that's because the angle between tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment.

Yes, that's a key property. So, angle ABD equals angle ACB. Similarly, angle ACD equals angle ABC.

Let me write that down.

Angle ABD = angle ACB.

Similarly, angle ACD = angle ABC.

Hmm, maybe I can use this to find some similar triangles or apply the sine law.

So, since angle ABD = angle ACB, and angle ADB is common between triangles ABD and ACB? Wait, maybe not exactly.

Wait, let me think. Triangle ABD and triangle ACB: if two angles are equal, maybe they are similar.

Wait, angle ABD = angle ACB (from tangent property), and angle BAD is common with angle BAC? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, triangle ABD: angle at B is ABD, angle at D is ADB, and angle at A is BAD.

Triangle ACB: angle at C is ACB, angle at B is ABC, angle at A is BAC.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to see if there's a similarity.

Alternatively, maybe using Ceva's theorem.

Wait, Ceva's theorem relates to concurrent lines, but here I have point D outside, so maybe not directly applicable.

Wait, another idea: maybe using power of a point D with respect to ω. Since D is outside ω, the power is DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Because DA is the secant from D passing through P and A, so power of D is DP * DA = DB².

So, DB² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, then I can write DP = (DB²)/DA.

But then, how do I find DA? Hmm, maybe I can express DA in terms of DP.

Wait, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DA = DP + PA? Or is it DA = DP - PA? Wait, depends on the direction. Since P is on AD between A and D, then DA = DP - PA? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, in the problem statement, AD intersects ω again at P. So, starting from A, going through P, and then extending to D outside the circle. So, the order is A --- P --- D along the line AD. So, DA is the length from D to A, which is equal to DP + PA. Wait, no, because DP is the length from D to P, which is the same as DA - PA. Wait, perhaps I should denote AP as x, then DP would be DA - x. Hmm, but without knowing DA, not sure.

Wait, but from power of a point, DB² = DP * DA.

So, DB² = DP * DA. But DP = DA - AP, because P is between A and D. So, substituting, DB² = (DA - AP) * DA.

But that's one equation with two variables, DA and AP. Hmm, I need another relation.

Alternatively, maybe I can express DA in terms of AP using similar triangles or some other properties.

Wait, maybe using Menelaus' theorem on triangle ABC with the transversal D-P somewhere? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using Stewart's theorem on triangle ABC with cevian AP? But I don't know where P is on BC. Wait, no, P is on the circumcircle.

Wait, maybe using intersecting chords: in circle ω, AP is a chord. So, perhaps some relations there.

Wait, maybe using the concept of similar triangles involving D, A, B, C.

Wait, let's go back to the tangent properties. Since DB and DC are tangents, DB=DC, as I said earlier. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB=DC.

If I can find the coordinates of these points, maybe coordinate geometry could help. Let me try that.

But with the given side lengths, maybe it's manageable. Let me assign coordinates.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10, 0), since AC=10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane.

Given that AB=5 and BC=9, so point B is at (x, y) such that distance from A is 5, from C is 9.

So, coordinates:

A = (10, 0)
C = (0, 0)
B = (x, y)

Then, distance from A to B: sqrt[(x-10)^2 + y^2] =5
Distance from C to B: sqrt[x^2 + y^2] =9

So, square both:

(x-10)^2 + y^2 =25
x^2 + y^2 =81

Subtracting first equation from second:

x^2 + y^2 - [(x-10)^2 + y^2] =81 -25
x^2 - (x^2 -20x +100) =56
x^2 -x^2 +20x -100=56
20x =156
x=156/20=39/5=7.8

So, x=7.8, which is 39/5.

Then, x^2 + y^2=81

So, (39/5)^2 + y^2=81

39/5 squared is (39^2)/(5^2)=1521/25.

So, y^2=81 -1521/25= (2025 -1521)/25=504/25

Thus, y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, no.

Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't integer. Let me factor 504.

504= 16*31.5, but that's not helpful. Let's factor 504: 504= 8*63=8*7*9=8*7*3^2. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(8*7*9)=sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7)=2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(14). Wait, wait.

Wait, 504= 16*31.5? No, 8*63=504. 63=9*7, so 504=8*9*7=72*7.

So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(72*7)=sqrt(36*2*7)=6*sqrt(14).

So, y=6*sqrt(14)/5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates:

A=(10,0)
B=(39/5, 6√14/5)
C=(0,0)

Now, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

Wait, how do I find the equations of the tangents at B and C?

First, the tangent at C: since C is (0,0), and the tangent at C to the circumcircle ω.

But to find the equation of the tangent at a point on a circle, we can use the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

So, the radius at point C is the line from the center of ω to C. Similarly, the radius at B is the line from the center to B.

So, first, I need to find the center of the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

Let me find the circumcenter O.

Given three points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

Let me compute the midpoints and slopes to find the perpendicular bisectors.

First, find the midpoint of AB.

Midpoint M of AB:

x-coordinate: (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 +39/5)/2=89/5 /2=89/10=8.9

y-coordinate: (0 + 6√14/5)/2= (6√14/5)/2=3√14/5.

So, M=(89/10, 3√14/5).

Slope of AB:

Slope from A(10,0) to B(39/5,6√14/5):

Δy=6√14/5 -0=6√14/5

Δx=39/5 -10=39/5 -50/5= -11/5

So, slope of AB is (6√14/5)/(-11/5)= -6√14/11.

Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6√14).

So, equation of perpendicular bisector of AB:

Using point-slope form, y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(x -89/10).

Similarly, find perpendicular bisector of AC.

Midpoint of AC: between A(10,0) and C(0,0) is (5,0).

Slope of AC: (0-0)/(0-10)=0. So, AC is horizontal. Therefore, perpendicular bisector is vertical, x=5.

So, the perpendicular bisector of AC is x=5.

Now, find the intersection point of x=5 and the perpendicular bisector of AB.

So, substitute x=5 into the first equation:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(5 -89/10)

Compute 5 -89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10= -39/10.

So,

y -3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))*(-39/10)

Compute RHS:

11 * (-39) / (6√14 *10) = (-429)/(60√14) = (-143)/(20√14)

Rationalize denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

(-143√14)/(20*14)= (-143√14)/280.

So,

y = 3√14/5 + (-143√14)/280

Convert 3√14/5 to denominator 280:

3√14/5 = (3√14 *56)/280 = 168√14/280.

So,

y = (168√14 -143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

So, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, let me check my calculation again. Hmm.

Wait, the perpendicular bisector of AB is y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(x -89/10).

At x=5,

y = 3√14/5 + (11/(6√14))(5 -89/10)

Compute 5 -89/10: 5 is 50/10, 50/10 -89/10 = (-39)/10.

So,

y = 3√14/5 + (11/(6√14))*(-39/10)

= 3√14/5 - (429)/(60√14)

Simplify 429/60: 429 ÷ 3=143, 60 ÷3=20. So, 143/20.

Thus,

= 3√14/5 - (143)/(20√14)

Multiply numerator and denominator of the second term by √14:

= 3√14/5 - (143√14)/(20*14)

= 3√14/5 - (143√14)/280

Convert 3√14/5 to 280 denominator:

3√14/5 = (3√14 *56)/280 = 168√14/280.

So,

y= (168√14 -143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = 5√14/56.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the circumradius center O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Now, I need the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, compute the slope of radius OB and the tangent at B.

Slope of radius OB: from O(5,5√14/56) to B(39/5,6√14/5).

Compute Δy: 6√14/5 -5√14/56

= (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5)/(5*56)

= (336√14 -25√14)/280

= (311√14)/280.

Δx: 39/5 -5 =39/5 -25/5=14/5.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5)= (311√14/280)*(5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14).

Simplify:

311 and 280: 311 is prime, 280=8*35=8*5*7.

So, 5 cancels with 280: 5/280=1/56.

So, slope is (311√14)/(56*14)=311√14/(784).

Wait, 280*14=3920. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 280*14= (28*10)*14=28*140=3920.

Wait, but the calculation was (311√14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555√14)/(3920). Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 1555/5=311, 3920/5=784.

So, slope is 311√14/784.

Since the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, its slope is the negative reciprocal.

So, slope of tangent at B: -784/(311√14).

Similarly, to find the equation of the tangent at B.

Equation of tangent at B: using point-slope form.

y - y_B = m*(x - x_B), where m is the slope.

So,

y - (6√14/5) = (-784)/(311√14)*(x -39/5).

Similarly, the tangent at C.

C is (0,0). The radius OC has slope from O(5,5√14/56) to C(0,0).

Slope of OC is (5√14/56 -0)/(5 -0)= (5√14/56)/5= √14/56.

So, slope of OC is √14/56.

Therefore, slope of tangent at C is negative reciprocal: -56/√14.

Simplify:

-56/√14 = -56√14/(14)= -4√14.

So, equation of tangent at C is y = -4√14 x.

Now, we have the equations of both tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.

We need to find point D, which is their intersection.

So, solving the two equations:

1. y = -4√14 x.

2. y - (6√14/5) = (-784)/(311√14)*(x -39/5).

Substitute y from equation 1 into equation 2.

So,

(-4√14 x) - (6√14/5) = (-784)/(311√14)*(x -39/5).

Let me write this equation.

Left side: -4√14 x - (6√14)/5.

Right side: (-784)/(311√14) * (x -39/5).

Let me multiply both sides by 311√14 to eliminate denominators.

Left side: (-4√14 x -6√14/5)*311√14

Right side: -784*(x -39/5)

Compute left side:

First term: (-4√14 x)*311√14 = (-4*311)*(√14 *√14)*x = (-1244)*(14)*x = (-1244 *14)x.

14 *1244: 1244*10=12440, 1244*4=4976, total 12440+4976=17416. So, first term is -17416x.

Second term: (-6√14 /5)*311√14 = (-6*311)*(√14 *√14)/5 = (-1866)*(14)/5 = (-26124)/5.

Right side: -784*(x -39/5) = -784x + (784*39)/5.

Compute 784*39:

Compute 700*39=27300, 84*39=3276. Total: 27300 + 3276 = 30576.

So, right side is -784x + 30576/5.

Now, put it all together:

Left side: -17416x -26124/5 = Right side: -784x +30576/5.

Bring all terms to left:

-17416x +784x -26124/5 -30576/5 =0.

Compute:

-17416x +784x = (-17416 +784)x = (-16632)x.

-26124/5 -30576/5 = (-26124 -30576)/5 = (-56700)/5= -11340.

So, equation becomes:

-16632x -11340=0.

So, -16632x =11340

x=11340 / (-16632)= -11340/16632.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 11340/12=945, 16632/12=1386.

So, x= -945/1386.

Simplify further: 945 and 1386.

Find GCD of 945 and 1386.

945: factors 5, 7, 3^3.

1386: 1386 ÷2=693, which is 693=3*231=3*3*77=3*3*7*11.

So, factors of 945: 3^3,5,7.

Factors of 1386: 2,3^2,7,11.

Common factors: 3^2,7.

So, GCD is 9*7=63.

Divide numerator and denominator by 63:

945 ÷63=15, 1386 ÷63=22.

So, x= -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Then, y= -4√14 x = -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, I need to find point P, which is the intersection of line AD with ω again.

First, find equation of line AD.

Points A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30√14/11).

Compute the slope of AD.

Slope m= (30√14/11 -0)/(-15/22 -10)

Compute denominator:

-15/22 -10= -15/22 -220/22= (-235)/22.

So, slope m= (30√14/11)/(-235/22)= (30√14/11) * (-22/235)= (30√14 * (-2))/235= (-60√14)/235.

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 5: (-12√14)/47.

So, slope m= -12√14/47.

Equation of AD: using point A(10,0):

y -0 = (-12√14/47)(x -10)

So, y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Now, need to find intersection of AD with ω, which is point P.

Equation of ω: since it's the circumcircle of ABC, we can write its equation.

We already found the center O(5,5√14/56). The radius can be computed from OA.

OA: distance from O(5,5√14/56) to A(10,0).

Compute Δx=5, Δy= -5√14/56.

So, OA^2=5^2 + (5√14/56)^2=25 + (25*14)/(56^2).

25 + (350)/(3136)=25 + (25*14)/(3136).

Wait, 25*14=350, 350/3136=25/224.

So, OA^2=25 +25/224= (25*224 +25)/224=25*(224 +1)/224=25*225/224=5625/224.

So, equation of ω: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2=5625/224.

Now, to find point P, which is another intersection of line AD with ω.

We have parametric equations for AD. Let me write parametric equations for AD.

Let parameter t go from 0 to 1, with t=0 at A(10,0) and t=1 at D(-15/22,30√14/11).

Parametric equations:

x=10 + t*(-15/22 -10)=10 + t*(-235/22)

y=0 + t*(30√14/11 -0)= t*(30√14/11)

So, x=10 - (235/22)t

y= (30√14/11) t

Now, substitute x and y into the circle equation.

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2=5625/224.

Substitute x=10 - (235/22)t, y=(30√14/11)t.

Compute each term.

First term: (x-5)^2= (5 - (235/22) t)^2= [5 - (235t)/22]^2.

Second term: (y -5√14/56)^2= [ (30√14/11)t -5√14/56 ]^2.

Let me compute each term.

First term:

[5 - (235t)/22]^2 =25 - 2*5*(235t)/22 + (235t/22)^2=25 - (2350t)/22 + (55225 t²)/484.

Second term:

Factor out √14:

√14 [ (30/11) t -5/56 ].

So, inside the square, becomes [√14 ( (30/11)t -5/56 )]^2=14*( (30/11 t -5/56 )^2.

Compute (30/11 t -5/56)^2:

= (30/11 t)^2 - 2*(30/11 t)*(5/56) + (5/56)^2

= (900/121)t² - (300/616)t +25/3136.

Multiply by 14:

= (900/121)*14 t² - (300/616)*14 t +25/3136*14.

Simplify:

= (12600/121)t² - (4200/616)t +350/3136.

Simplify fractions:

12600/121 is as is.

4200/616: Divide numerator and denominator by 28: 150/22=75/11.

350/3136: Divide numerator and denominator by 14:25/224.

So, second term becomes:

(12600/121) t² - (75/11) t +25/224.

Now, sum first and second terms:

First term:25 - (2350t)/22 + (55225 t²)/484.

Second term:12600/121 t² -75/11 t +25/224.

So, total left side:

25 + 25/224 - (2350t)/22 -75/11 t + (55225 t²)/484 +12600/121 t².

Let me compute each part.

Constants:25 +25/224= (25*224 +25)/224= (5600 +25)/224=5625/224.

Linear terms: -(2350t)/22 -75/11 t.

Convert to same denominator:

2350/22=117.5, but better to express in fractions.

2350/22=1175/11, so -(1175/11)t.

75/11 t.

So, total linear term: -(1175/11 +75/11) t= -1250/11 t.

Quadratic terms:

(55225 t²)/484 +12600/121 t².

Convert 12600/121 t² to denominator 484: multiply numerator and denominator by 4: 50400/484.

So, 55225 t² +50400 t²=105625 t².

So, quadratic term is 105625 t² /484.

So, left side equation:

5625/224 - (1250/11) t + (105625 t²)/484=5625/224.

Subtract 5625/224 from both sides:

- (1250/11) t + (105625 t²)/484=0.

Factor t:

t*(-1250/11 + (105625 t)/484)=0.

So, solutions are t=0 and t= (1250/11)*(484/105625).

Compute t=0 corresponds to point A(10,0). The other solution is t= (1250/11)*(484/105625).

Simplify.

First, 484=22^2, 105625=325^2.

Wait, 105625=10000*10.5625? Not sure. Let me compute 105625 ÷ 25=4225, which is 65^2.

So, 105625=25*4225=25*65^2.

Similarly, 484=4*121=4*11^2.

So, t= (1250/11)*(484/105625)= (1250/11)*(4*121)/(25*65^2).

Simplify:

1250=25*50.

484=4*121=4*11^2.

105625=25*65^2.

So,

t= (25*50 /11) * (4*11^2)/(25*65^2)

Simplify:

25 cancels, 4 remains.

50/11 * 4*11^2 /65^2.

50/11 *4 *11^2 =50*4*11=200*11=2200.

So, t=2200/(65^2).

Compute 65^2=4225.

So, t=2200/4225.

Simplify.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 2200/25=88, 4225/25=169.

So, t=88/169.

So, t=88/169.

Therefore, point P is at:

x=10 - (235/22)*(88/169)

y= (30√14/11)*(88/169)

Compute x:

235/22 *88/169.

235 and 22: 235=5*47, 22=2*11.

88=8*11, 169=13^2.

So, 235/22 *88/169= (235 *88)/(22*169).

Simplify:

88/22=4.

So, (235 *4)/169=940/169.

So, x=10 -940/169= (1690 -940)/169=750/169.

Similarly, y= (30√14/11)*(88/169)= (30√14 *88)/(11*169).

Simplify:

88/11=8.

So, (30√14 *8)/169=240√14/169.

So, point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, need to find the length AP.

Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169,240√14/169).

Compute the distance between A and P.

Δx=750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (-940)/169.

Δy=240√14/169 -0=240√14/169.

So, AP= sqrt[ (-940/169)^2 + (240√14/169)^2 ].

Factor out 1/169^2:

AP= (1/169)*sqrt[940^2 + (240√14)^2 ].

Compute inside the sqrt:

940^2= (900+40)^2=900^2 +2*900*40 +40^2=810000+72000+1600=883600.

(240√14)^2=240^2 *14=57600*14=806400.

So, total inside sqrt=883600 +806400=1,690,000.

So, sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.

So, AP=1300/169.

Simplify:

1300 ÷13=100, 169 ÷13=13.

So, 1300/169=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

Thus, m=100, n=13, which are coprime. So, m +n=113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) has sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). We need to find the length \(AP\), where \(P\) is the second intersection of line \(AD\) with the circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(ABC\).

1. **Coordinates of Points**:
   - Place \(C\) at the origin \((0, 0)\) and \(A\) at \((10, 0)\).
   - Determine coordinates of \(B\) using the given side lengths. Solving the system of equations from the distances, we find \(B\) at \(\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right)\).

2. **Circumcenter Calculation**:
   - The circumcenter \(O\) of triangle \(ABC\) is found by intersecting the perpendicular bisectors of \(AB\) and \(AC\). After calculations, \(O\) is located at \(\left(5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56}\right)\).

3. **Equations of Tangents**:
   - The tangent at \(C\) has the equation \(y = -4\sqrt{14}x\).
   - The tangent at \(B\) is derived using the slope perpendicular to the radius \(OB\), leading to the equation \(y - \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5} = -\frac{784}{311\sqrt{14}}\left(x - \frac{39}{5}\right)\).

4. **Intersection Point \(D\)**:
   - Solving the equations of the tangents, point \(D\) is found at \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

5. **Equation of Line \(AD\)**:
   - Using points \(A(10, 0)\) and \(D\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\), the equation of line \(AD\) is determined as \(y = -\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47}x + \frac{120\sqrt{14}}{47}\).

6. **Intersection with Circumcircle**:
   - Substituting the parametric equations of line \(AD\) into the circumcircle equation, we solve for the parameter \(t\) and find the coordinates of point \(P\) as \(\left(\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)\).

7. **Distance \(AP\)**:
   - Using the distance formula between \(A(10, 0)\) and \(P\left(\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)\), we calculate \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\).

Thus, \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\), and \(m + n = 100 + 13 = 113\).

\(\boxed{113}\)
