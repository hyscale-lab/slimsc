Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner. The condition is that each path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has 9 horizontal and 9 vertical lines, right? So, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner would require moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because each path is of length 16.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, what does it mean to change direction? Well, in a grid path, you can only move either right or up. So, a direction change happens when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right.

Let me think, if a path has exactly four direction changes, how does that translate to the number of straight segments? For example, if you start moving right, then up, then right, then up, each switch is a direction change. So, each direction change adds a new segment. Therefore, starting with one segment, each change adds another. So, four direction changes would mean five segments in total.

Wait, because starting with the first direction, each change adds a segment. So, four changes would split the path into five segments. Each segment is a straight line, either all right or all up.

So, the path has five segments. Now, these segments are alternately right and up. So, the path starts either right or up, and alternates each time it changes direction.

But wait, since the path starts at the lower left, which is the bottom-left corner, the first move has to be either right or up, but if it starts with up, it can't go beyond the grid. Hmm, no, actually, you can start with either direction as long as it doesn't go outside. So, the starting direction could be either right or up.

But, considering the grid is 8x8, the path has to make exactly 8 right moves and 8 up moves in total. So, the sum of all the right segments is 8, and the sum of all the up segments is 8.

Since the path is divided into five segments, which alternate between right and up, the number of right segments and up segments could be either three right and two up segments or two right and three up segments. Wait, no, because the starting direction affects that.

Let me clarify. If the path starts with a right segment, then the sequence of segments is right, up, right, up, right. So, that's three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, if it starts with an up segment, the sequence is up, right, up, right, up. So, that's three up segments and two right segments.

But wait, the total number of direction changes is four. So, the number of segments is five, as I thought earlier. So, the number of right segments and up segments depends on whether the path starts with right or up.

So, let me think about this: If the path starts with right, then the number of right segments is three and up segments is two. If it starts with up, then the number of up
