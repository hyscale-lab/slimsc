Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each of these boxes has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, we're told that r squared can be written as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime positive integers, and we need to find p + q.

Alright, so let me break this down. First, each box in set B has surface area 54 and volume 23. So, for a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume V is lwh. So, we have two equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

We need to find the minimal sphere that can contain the box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere has to enclose the entire box, the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius r will be (space diagonal)/2.

The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(l² + w² + h²). Therefore, r = sqrt(l² + w² + h²)/2. So, r squared is (l² + w² + h²)/4.

Our goal is to minimize r, which is equivalent to minimizing the space diagonal d, since r is proportional to d. So, we need to find the minimum possible value of sqrt(l² + w² + h²) given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Alternatively, since sqrt is a monotonic function, we can instead focus on minimizing l² + w² + h².

So, let me formalize the problem:

Minimize f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h²

Subject to:
1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

And l, w, h > 0.

This looks like a constrained optimization problem. So, I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me try to set that up.

We have two constraints, so we'll need two Lagrange multipliers, say λ and μ.

The Lagrangian function L would be:

L = l² + w² + h² - λ(2(lw + lh + wh) - 54) - μ(lwh - 23)

We can then take partial derivatives with respect to l, w, h, set them equal to zero, and solve the system of equations.

Let me compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂l = 2l - λ(2w + 2h) - μ(wh) = 0
∂L/∂w = 2w - λ(2l + 2h) - μ(lh) = 0
∂L/∂h = 2h - λ(2l + 2w) - μ(lw) = 0

So, we have three equations:

1. 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh = 0
2. 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh = 0
3. 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw = 0

Hmm, this seems complex. Maybe there's some symmetry here. If I assume that the box is a cube, then l = w = h. Let me check if that's possible.

If l = w = h, then the surface area would be 2(3 l²) = 6 l² = 54, so l² = 9, so l = 3. Then the volume would be l³ = 27, but in our case, the volume is 23, not 27. So, it's not a cube. Therefore, the minimal sphere probably isn't achieved by a cube, but maybe by some other proportions.

So, since it's not a cube, perhaps the minimal space diagonal occurs when two sides are equal, but not all three. Let's suppose that l = w, but h is different. Let me see if that assumption can hold.

Let me let l = w, so l = w. Then, the surface area equation becomes:

2(l² + 2lh) = 54 → l² + 2lh = 27

The volume is l² h = 23 → h = 23/(l²)

Substituting h into the surface area equation:

l² + 2l*(23/(l²)) = 27 → l² + (46/l) = 27

Multiply both sides by l to eliminate the denominator:

l³ + 46 = 27 l → l³ - 27 l + 46 = 0

Hmm, solving for l here. Let me see if I can find a real positive root.

Let me try l = 3: 27 - 81 +46 = -8. Not zero.

l=4: 64 - 108 +46= 2. Close.

l=3.5: 42.875 - 94.5 +46 = -3.625

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots of l³ -27 l +46=0 would be factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing l=2: 8 -54 +46= 0. Oh, l=2 is a root.

So, I can factor this as (l - 2)(l² + 2l -23) = 0

Wait, let's perform the polynomial division to confirm.

Divide l³ -27 l +46 by (l -2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23 0

So yes, it factors into (l -2)(l² + 2 l -23)=0

So, the roots are l=2, and l = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6)

Since l must be positive, we have l=2, or l= -1 + 2 sqrt(6). Let's compute 2 sqrt(6): sqrt(6)≈2.449, so 2*2.449≈4.898, so -1 +4.898≈3.898. So, l=2 or l≈3.898.

So, l=2 gives h=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75

But l=2: let's check if that makes sense.

Wait, let's compute the surface area when l=w=2, then h=5.75:

Surface area: 2( (2*2) + (2*5.75) + (2*5.75) ) = 2(4 + 11.5 +11.5) = 2(27)=54. Correct.

Volume: 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.

So, that's one possible box: a square base with sides 2 and height 5.75.

The other root is l≈3.898, so h=23/(3.898²). Let me compute 3.898 squared: approx 3.898^2 ≈15.19, so h≈23/15.19≈1.514.

Let me compute the surface area:

l=w≈3.898, h≈1.514

2*(lw + lh + wh) = 2*( (3.898)^2 + 2*3.898*1.514 )

Compute 3.898^2≈15.19

Then 2*3.898*1.514≈2*5.903≈11.806

So, lw + lh + wh≈15.19 +11.806≈26.996≈27, which is correct because surface area is 54.

So, that also gives a valid box.

Now, which of these two boxes has a smaller space diagonal?

Compute the space diagonal for the first case: l=w=2, h=5.75

d = sqrt(2² + 2² +5.75²) = sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.408...

So, r=6.408/2≈3.204, so r²≈10.268.

Second case: l≈3.898, w≈3.898, h≈1.514

d≈sqrt( (3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (1.514)^2 )

Compute each term:

3.898²≈15.19, so two of them add up to ~30.38

1.514²≈2.292

Total≈30.38 +2.292≈32.672

d≈sqrt(32.672)≈5.716

Thus, r≈5.716/2≈2.858, r²≈8.171

So, the second case has a smaller r², so that's better.

Wait, but is this the minimal? Or maybe the minimal occurs when all three sides are different?

Hmm, but our assumption was that l=w, but perhaps the minimal occurs when all three are different. Alternatively, maybe we can assume symmetry in some other way.

Wait, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers without assuming any symmetry would be better. Let's try that.

So, we have the three equations:

1. 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh = 0
2. 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh = 0
3. 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw = 0

Let me see if I can subtract equations to find some relations.

Subtract equation 1 and equation 2:

[2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh] - [2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh] = 0

Simplify:

2(l - w) - 2λ(w + h - l - h) - μ (wh - lh) = 0

Simplify terms:

2(l - w) - 2λ(w - l) - μ h (w - l) = 0

Factor (l - w):

[2 + 2λ + μ h] (l - w) = 0

So, either l = w, or 2 + 2λ + μ h = 0.

Similarly, subtract equation 1 and equation 3:

2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh - [2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw] = 0

Simplify:

2(l - h) - 2λ(w + h - l - w) - μ (wh - lw) = 0

Which becomes:

2(l - h) - 2λ (h - l)
