Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let's try to unpack it step by step. Sometimes geometry problems can be tricky, especially with all these conditions, but let's take it slow.

First, the hexagon is convex and equilateral. That means all its sides are equal in length, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal. Also, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, so if I label the hexagon ABCDEF, then AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. That makes sense because in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, but since this one is just equilateral and convex, the angles might differ.

The problem also mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Alright, let's visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon and are all equal in length, their extensions will form a larger triangle outside the hexagon. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. So, the triangle is scalene.

I think this problem might relate to similar triangles or perhaps using the properties of parallel lines and intercept theorems. Maybe the hexagon is similar to the triangle in some way, or maybe it's part of a larger triangle which is being divided by the hexagon.

Let me consider the properties of a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. Such a hexagon is known as a "parallelogon." Wait, no, a parallelogon is a polygon with opposite sides equal and parallel, but in two dimensions, the only such polygons are parallelograms and hexagons can be as well, but they aren't regular. So, in this case, the hexagon being equilateral and with opposite sides parallel must have some specific properties.

One approach I can think of is to model the hexagon as a combination of parallelograms. Since opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, each pair of opposite sides forms a parallelogram with the adjacent sides. Wait, but since it's a hexagon, maybe it's made up of three pairs of opposite sides, each pair forming a parallelogram with the adjacent sides.

Alternatively, I can try to model this hexagon in a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices and then try to find relationships based on the given conditions.

But before getting into coordinates, maybe there's a more straightforward geometric approach. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, I can think of it as being inscribed within a triangle, where each pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of the triangle.

Wait, that might not be accurate, but let's think. If I have a triangle, and I extend some sides of the hexagon to form that triangle, then perhaps the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down. But the sides of the hexagon are all equal, so scaling down might not directly apply.

Another thought: In a
