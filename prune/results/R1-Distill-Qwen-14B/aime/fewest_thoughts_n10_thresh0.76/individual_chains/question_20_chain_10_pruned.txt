Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. I need to place some of these chips in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, the arrangement should be such that if I try to place any more chip on the grid, it would violate one or both of the first two conditions.

And I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, each row and each column must be uniformly colored. So, for each row, I decide whether it's all white or all black, and same for each column. But wait, that might not hold, because if I decide a row is white, but a column is black, then their intersection would have conflicting colors. So that's a problem.

Wait, but each cell can be occupied by at most one chip, but the color is determined by the row or the column. So, for a cell at (i,j), its color is determined by row i and column j. However, to satisfy both row and column conditions, the color of the row must match the color of the column. Otherwise, the cell would have conflicting color requirements, which isn't possible. So, each cell's color is the same as both its row and column.

But wait, does that mean that all the rows and columns must have the same color? That would only be possible if all rows and columns are the same color, which would either be all white or all black. But that can't be because we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So, that approach must be wrong.

Wait, maybe not all rows and columns are the same color. Let me think differently.

Suppose I decide that each row is either all white or all black, but columns can also be all white or all black. But for a given cell (i,j), the color must be the same as both row i and column j. Therefore, for a row i and column j, their colors must be the same. So, if row i is white, then all columns that intersect row i must be white as well. Similarly, if a column j is black, then all rows that intersect column j
