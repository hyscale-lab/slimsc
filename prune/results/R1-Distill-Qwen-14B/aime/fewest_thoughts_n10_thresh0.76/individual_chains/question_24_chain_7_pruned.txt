Okay, so I need to solve this math problem. Let's read it again carefully.

We have a list of positive integers with three properties:
1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more times than any other number, and no other number has the same count as 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. Let's consider each property one by one and see how they can help us figure out the list.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers we have, they add up to 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. That means 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, for example, if 9 appears twice, no other number can appear twice or more. If 9 appears three times, no other number can appear three or more times. So the count of 9 is crucial here.

Third, the median is a positive integer not in the list. Hmm, the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If the median is not in the list, that suggests that the number of elements in the list is even because for an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But wait, the median is stated to be a positive integer. So if the list has an even number of elements, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer and not present in the list.

Wait, let me think about that. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which must be present in the list. But the problem says the median is not in the list. So that implies that the list must have an even number of elements because then the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not be present in the list.

So, the list must have an even number of elements. Let me write that down.

Let me denote the number of elements as n, which is even. So, n is an even integer. Let's denote the elements in increasing order as a1, a2, ..., a_n.

The median is (a_{n/2} + a_{n/2 +1}) / 2, and this is an integer not present in the list.

So, the sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list.

Now, let's think about the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. So, the number of times 9 appears must be at least 2, but actually, let's see. If the list has only one 9, it can't be the mode because other numbers could also appear once. So, 9 must appear at least twice. But wait, if 9 appears twice, can any other number appear twice as well? No, because the mode is unique. So if 9 appears twice, no other number can appear twice or more. So, in that case, 9 is the mode, appearing twice
