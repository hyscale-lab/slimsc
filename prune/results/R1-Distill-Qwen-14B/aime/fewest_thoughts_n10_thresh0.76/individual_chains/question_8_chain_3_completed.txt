Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, interesting.

Let me start by trying to understand what's going on here. The first equation is straightforward—it's the sum of a, b, and c equaling 300. The second equation is more complicated. It looks like it's a combination of terms where each variable is squared and multiplied by the other two. Let me write it out again: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, is there a way to factor this or simplify it?

Wait, I notice that each term is symmetric in two variables. For example, a²b and a²c both have a². Similarly, b²a and b²c both have b², and c²a and c²b both have c². So maybe I can factor each pair. Let me try that.

Looking at the first two terms, a²b + a²c, I can factor out a², which gives a²(b + c). Similarly, the next two terms are b²a + b²c, which factors to b²(a + c). The last two terms are c²a + c²b, which factors to c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), because a + b + c = 300 implies that b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Let me write that out:

= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So now, the equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can factor this differently or find a pattern. Let me think about each term. Each term is of the form 300x² - x³, where x is a, b, or c.

So, 300x² - x³ can be rewritten as x²(300 - x). So the entire left side is:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Wait, that's exactly what we had before. So perhaps I should think about what each individual term could contribute.

Let me consider the function f(x) = x²(300 - x). So, for each variable x (a, b, c), we're computing f(x) and summing them up.

I wonder if this function f(x) has a maximum or if it's increasing or decreasing. Let's take the derivative to see.

f(x) = x²(300 - x) = 300x² - x³

f'(x) = 600x - 3x²

Setting derivative to zero:

600x - 3x² = 0

x(600 - 3x) = 0

So x=0 or x = 600/3 = 200.

So the function f(x) has a maximum at x=200. Let's check the value at x=200:

f(200) = 200²*(300 - 200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000.

Wait, but our total sum is 6,000,000. Hmm, so if each f(x) for a, b, c can be up to 4,000,000, but the sum is 6,000,000. So perhaps each a, b, c is contributing around 2,000,000 each? But that doesn't make sense because 3*4,000,000 is 12,000,000, which is way larger than 6,000,000. Wait, no, 300 is the sum, so if a is 200, then b + c is 100. So perhaps the variables can't all be 200. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that since a + b + c = 300, and each is non-negative, perhaps each of them is at most 300. So, the maximum any one of them can be is 300. Let me check f(300):

f(300) = 300²*(300 - 300) = 90,000 * 0 = 0.

So, when x is 300, f(x) is zero. So the function f(x) increases from x=0 to x=200, reaching a maximum of 4,000,000, then decreases back to 0 at x=300.

So each term a²(300 - a) can range from 0 to 4,000,000, depending on a's value.

So, our total sum is 6,000,000. Let's see, 6,000,000 divided by 3 is 2,000,000. So if each of a, b, c contributes about 2,000,000, that might be a way to approach it.

Wait, but each f(x) goes up to 4e6, so it's possible for two variables to be 200 each, but that would make their sum 400, which is more than 300. So that can't happen. So perhaps one variable is 200, and the others are smaller.

Alternatively, maybe all variables are around 100.

Wait, maybe I should consider specific cases where one or more variables are 200, as that's where f(x) is maximized.

Let me try that.

Case 1: Suppose one variable is 200. Let's say a = 200. Then b + c = 100.

So, our sum would be:

f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 4,000,000 + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

So f(b) + f(c) = 2,000,000.

But since b + c = 100, let me see what f(b) + f(c) would be.

Express f(b) + f(c) as b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c). But since c = 100 - b, we can write this as:

f(b) + f(100 - b) = b²(300 - b) + (100 - b)²(300 - (100 - b)).

Simplify that:

= b²(300 - b) + (100 - b)²(200 + b)

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe we can compute this for some specific values.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider that for b + c = 100, the maximum f(b) + f(c) would be when one of them is 100, and the other is 0.

Wait, let me compute f(100) + f(0):

f(100) = 100² * (300 - 100) = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000.

f(0) = 0.

So f(100) + f(0) = 2,000,000.

Similarly, if b = 100 and c = 0, then f(b) + f(c) = 2,000,000.

So that's exactly what we need. So in this case, when a = 200, b = 100, c = 0, the sum f(a) + f(b) + f(c) would be 4e6 + 2e6 + 0 = 6e6. That fits.

Similarly, if a = 200, b=0, c=100, same result.

So, these are valid triples: (200, 100, 0), (200, 0, 100), and any permutation where one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0.

Wait, but how many such triples are there?

Since the variables are ordered, so for each permutation where one is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0, we have 3! = 6 permutations. But wait, in this case, 100 and 0 are distinct, so each of the three variables can be assigned to 200, and then the other two can be arranged in 2 ways (which is 100 and 0). So for each choice of the variable being 200, there are 2 permutations, so total of 3 * 2 = 6 triples.

So that's 6 triples so far.

But wait, are there other possibilities where a, b, c are not 200, 100, 0?

Let me check.

Suppose instead that two variables are 200. But wait, a + b + c = 300, so if two variables are 200, the third would be 300 - 400 = -100, which is negative. Not allowed since we're dealing with nonnegative integers. So that's impossible.

What if a variable is more than 200? For example, 250. Let's compute f(250):

f(250) = 250² * (300 - 250) = 62,500 * 50 = 3,125,000.

If a = 250, then b + c = 50. Then f(b) + f(c) would need to be 6,000,000 - 3,125,000 = 2,875,000. Let's see if that's possible.

Wait, but the maximum f(b) + f(c) when b + c = 50 would be if one of them is 50 and the other is 0. So f(50) + f(0) = 50² * 250 + 0 = 2500 * 250 = 625,000. Which is way less than 2,875,000. So that's not possible. So a can't be 250.

Similarly, any a larger than 200 would have a higher f(a), but the remaining two variables would have a sum less than 100, so their f(b) + f(c) would be too small. So the only possibility for a being 200 is when the other two are 100 and 0. So that's the only case where one variable is 200, and others are 100 and 0.

What about if a variable is less than 200, say 150. Let's see.

If a = 150, then b + c = 150.

Compute f(a) = 150² * 150 = 22500 * 150 = 3,375,000.

So f(b) + f(c) would need to be 6,000,000 - 3,375,000 = 2,625,000.

Now, since b + c = 150, the maximum f(b) + f(c) occurs when one is 150 and the other is 0. So f(150) + f(0) = 3,375,000 + 0 = 3,375,000, which is more than 2,625,000. So maybe there are solutions here.

But wait, how would that work? Let me try to find integer solutions where a=150, and b + c=150, and f(b) + f(c) = 2,625,000.

So, we have:

f(b) + f(c) = b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 2,625,000.

But since c = 150 - b, we can substitute:

= b²(300 - b) + (150 - b)²(300 - (150 - b)).

Simplify the second term:

300 - (150 - b) = 150 + b.

So:

= b²(300 - b) + (150 - b)^2 (150 + b)

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to compute for specific values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a quadratic equation. Let me set b as a variable and try to find possible integer solutions.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider that a=150 and b and c are such that their sum is 150, and their f(b) + f(c) is 2,625,000.

Wait, but maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me think if there's another way.

Wait, another thought: since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of symmetric sums or use substitution.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

We have the equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I can factor this equation as:

ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) = 6,000,000.

But since S = a + b + c, then a + b = S - c, etc.

So substituting, we get:

ab(S - c) + bc(S - a) + ca(S - b) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

ab(S - c) = abS - abc

Similarly, bc(S - a) = bcS - abc

ca(S - b) = caS - abc

So adding them together:

(abS + bcS + caS) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Factor S from the first part:

S(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Since S = 300, we have:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So now, the equation simplifies to:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, how can I approach this?

Let me denote P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca.

So the equation becomes:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

But I don't know P or Q. But perhaps I can relate Q and P through the known sum S = a + b + c = 300.

We know from algebra that for three variables,

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the correct identity.

The identity is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) + 6abc.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it differently. Another identity:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) - 3abc.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the equation:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a^2b + a^2c + ab^2 + b^2c + ac^2 + bc^2 + 3abc.

Wait, no, let me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):

= a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)

But that seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

= a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)

= a^2b + a b c + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c a + a c^2 + b c^2 + c^2 a

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should think of it another way.

Wait, another approach: we have S = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

We can write the equation as 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Now, let me think about the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c. It can be written as:

x^3 - Sx^2 + Qx - P = 0

So, substituting S=300, Q=..., P=..., the equation becomes:

x^3 - 300x^2 + Qx - P = 0.

But since P = 100Q - 2,000,000, we can write:

x^3 - 300x^2 + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x^3 - 300x^2 + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express Q in terms of S and the other variables.

Wait, I know that for three variables, we have:

(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, S^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2Q.

So, Q = (S^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)) / 2.

But I don't know a^2 + b^2 + c^2. Hmm.

Wait, let me go back to the original equation. We had:

300a² + 300b² + 300c² - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute a³ + b³ + c³.

Wait, another identity: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Which is S^3 - 3 S Q + 3 P.

So, substituting that into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c^2) - [S^3 - 3 S Q + 3 P] = 6,000,000.

We know S = 300, so S^3 = 27,000,000.

So,

300(a² + b² + c^2) - [27,000,000 - 3*300 Q + 3 P] = 6,000,000.

But from earlier, we have 100 Q - P = 2,000,000, so P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

Let me substitute P into the equation.

So,

300(a² + b² + c^2) - [27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3*(100 Q - 2,000,000)] = 6,000,000.

Simplify inside the brackets:

= 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 300 Q - 6,000,000.

= 27,000,000 - 6,000,000 - 600 Q.

= 21,000,000 - 600 Q.

So, the equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c^2) - (21,000,000 - 600 Q) = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

300(a² + b² + c^2) - 21,000,000 + 600 Q = 6,000,000.

Bring constants to the right:

300(a² + b² + c^2) + 600 Q = 27,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300:

(a² + b² + c^2) + 2 Q = 90,000.

Now, from earlier, we have:

S^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2 Q.

Which means:

a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S^2 - 2 Q = 300^2 - 2 Q = 90,000 - 2 Q.

Substituting this into the equation we just obtained:

(90,000 - 2 Q) + 2 Q = 90,000.

Simplify:

90,000 = 90,000.

Hmm, that's an identity, which suggests that our manipulations are correct but don't give us new information. So perhaps this path isn't helpful.

Let me think again. So, we have:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

And we also have that S = 300.

Wait, perhaps I can write Q and P in terms of the variables, but I'm not sure. Let me try another approach.

Wait, maybe I can consider specific cases where two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, perhaps I can find some symmetry.

Let me assume that a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.

Now, let's compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b, this becomes:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Which is 2a³ + 2a²c + 2c²a.

Factor this:

= 2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c².

Factor 2a:

= 2a(a² + a c + c²).

But since c = 300 - 2a, let's substitute:

= 2a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2].

Simplify inside the brackets:

= 2a [a² + 300a - 2a² + (90,000 - 1200a + 4a²)].

Combine like terms:

= 2a [a² - 2a² + 4a² + 300a -1200a + 90,000].

= 2a [3a² - 900a + 90,000].

So, the entire expression is 2a(3a² - 900a + 90,000).

We are told that this equals 6,000,000.

So,

2a(3a² - 900a + 90,000) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2:

a(3a² - 900a + 90,000) = 3,000,000.

Hmm, that's:

3a³ - 900a² + 90,000a - 3,000,000 = 0.

Divide both sides by 3:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me see if I can find integer roots. Let's try a=100.

100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000.

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.

Yes, a=100 is a root. So, we can factor this as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0.

Wait, let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Divide a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100):

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000

            100      -20,000      1,000,000

        1    -200      10,000          0

So the quadratic factor is a² - 200a + 10,000.

Now, solving a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0:

Using quadratic formula:

a = [200 ± sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 ± 0]/2 = 100.

So, the equation has a triple root at a=100.

So, the only real solution is a=100. But since a must be an integer, we have a=100.

So, when a = b = 100, then c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.

So, we get the triple (100, 100, 100). Let me check if this satisfies the original equation.

Compute a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b:

Each term would be 100²*100 = 1,000,000.

There are six terms, so 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Perfect.

So, this is a valid solution. Now, how many such triples are there when a = b = 100, c=100.

But wait, since all three are equal, this is just one triple: (100, 100, 100).

So, that's another solution. So far, we have 6 triples from the case where one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0, and one triple where all are 100.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if there are other cases where two variables are equal but not 100.

Wait, in the case where a = b, we found a=100 is the only solution. So, no other solutions in that case.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider other cases where two variables are equal but perhaps not a = b.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of other possibilities where none of the variables are equal. But that might be complicated.

Wait, another thought: since we have the triple (200, 100, 0) and its permutations, and the triple (100, 100, 100), perhaps these are the only possible solutions. But let me check.

Wait, another possibility: what if two variables are 200, but that's impossible since a + b + c = 300, so 2*200 = 400 > 300. So that's not possible.

What about if one variable is 150, another is 150, and the third is 0. Let's see.

a = 150, b = 150, c = 0. Does this satisfy the equation?

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Which is:

150²*150 + 150²*0 + 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 0²*150 + 0²*150.

Simplify:

= 150^3 + 0 + 150^3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000.

Which is more than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.

Another possibility: a=150, b=75, c=75.

Wait, let's compute S = 150 +75 +75 = 300. Good.

Now compute the sum:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

= 150²*75 + 150²*75 + 75²*150 + 75²*75 + 75²*150 + 75²*75.

Hmm, let's compute each term:

150²*75 = 22500 * 75 = 1,687,500.

There are two such terms, so 2*1,687,500 = 3,375,000.

75²*150 = 5625 * 150 = 843,750.

There are two such terms, so 2*843,750 = 1,687,500.

75²*75 = 5625 *75 = 421,875.

There are two such terms, so 2*421,875 = 843,750.

Adding them all together: 3,375,000 + 1,687,500 + 843,750 = 5,906,250. Which is less than 6,000,000.

Hmm, not quite enough. So perhaps that's not a solution.

Alternatively, maybe a=100, b=100, c=100 is the only case where variables are equal, and the other case is when one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0.

Wait, but let me think again about the initial case when a=200, b=100, c=0.

Is there any other case where variables are arranged differently?

Wait, what if a=200, b=50, c=50.

Then, a + b + c = 200 +50 +50 = 300. Good.

Compute the sum:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

= 200²*50 + 200²*50 + 50²*200 + 50²*50 + 50²*200 + 50²*50.

Compute each term:

200²*50 = 40,000*50 = 2,000,000. Two terms: 4,000,000.

50²*200 = 2,500*200 = 500,000. Two terms: 1,000,000.

50²*50 = 2,500*50 = 125,000. Two terms: 250,000.

Total sum: 4,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 250,000 = 5,250,000. Which is less than 6,000,000.

Hmm, so that's not enough.

Wait, maybe if b=200 and a=100, c=0, but that's the same as the first case.

Alternatively, perhaps the only possible cases are (200, 100, 0) and permutations, and (100, 100, 100).

Wait, but let me check another case where one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0, which gives us 6 triples. Plus the one triple where all are 100. So total of 7 triples.

Wait, but wait, when I considered a=200, b=100, c=0, and all permutations, that's 6 triples. Then, the case where all are 100 is another one, so total 7.

Wait, but that might not be all. Let me see if there's any other case where, say, one variable is 200, another is 50, and the third is 150. Wait, a=200, b=50, c=50. Wait, but that sums to 300.

Wait, let's compute the sum:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

=200²*50 + 200²*50 +50²*200 +50²*50 +50²*200 +50²*50.

As before, that was 5,250,000, which is less than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.

Alternatively, maybe a=200, b=200, c=-100, but that's invalid because c can't be negative.

Alternatively, perhaps if a=150, b=75, c=75. Wait, I tried that earlier and got 5,906,250, which is close but not enough.

Wait, maybe trying another approach, let's consider that the equation 100 Q - P = 2,000,000 can be rewritten as P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

We also know that for non-negative integers a, b, c, the product abc is non-negative.

So, P = 100 Q - 2,000,000 must be ≥ 0.

So, 100 Q - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 → Q ≥ 20,000.

So, the sum of products ab + bc + ca must be at least 20,000.

But when a=200, b=100, c=0, Q = (200*100) + (100*0) + (0*200) = 20,000 + 0 + 0 = 20,000.

Which is exactly the minimum. So, that's the case where Q=20,000, P=0.

In the case when all are 100, Q = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 30,000.

And P = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000.

So, P = 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 → 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000, which matches.

So, perhaps these are the only two cases: either Q=20,000 and P=0, or Q=30,000 and P=1,000,000.

Let me see if there are other possibilities. Suppose Q=25,000.

Then P = 100*25,000 - 2,000,000 = 2,500,000 - 2,000,000 = 500,000.

So, we'd have P=500,000 and Q=25,000.

Can this happen? Let's see if there are non-negative integers a, b, c with a + b + c=300, ab + bc + ca=25,000, and abc=500,000.

Hmm, but solving this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the only solutions are the ones we found earlier.

So, if that's the case, then the only triples are those where either one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0, or all variables are 100.

So, the number of such triples would be the number of permutations of (200, 100, 0) plus the single triple (100,100,100).

The permutations of (200, 100, 0): since all three are distinct, there are 3! = 6 permutations.

Plus the one triple where all are equal: (100, 100, 100).

So, total of 6 + 1 = 7 triples.

Wait, but let me check if there are any other possibilities where Q is between 20,000 and 30,000.

Wait, suppose Q=25,000 and P=500,000.

Then, the variables would have to satisfy a + b + c=300, ab + bc + ca=25,000, and abc=500,000.

But finding such integers is non-trivial. Alternatively, perhaps this isn't possible, so the only solutions are the ones we found.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is 6 + 1 = 7.


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of nonnegative integers satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\).

### Key Steps:

1. **Equation Transformation**:
   The given equation can be rewritten as:
   \[
   a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000
   \]
   Using \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\), leading to:
   \[
   300a^2 - a^3 + 300b^2 - b^3 + 300c^2 - c^3 = 6,000,000
   \]

2. **Function Analysis**:
   Define \(f(x) = x^2(300 - x)\). The equation becomes:
   \[
   f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000
   \]
   The function \(f(x)\) has a maximum at \(x = 200\), where \(f(200) = 4,000,000\). Thus, each term \(f(a), f(b), f(c)\) can contribute up to \(4,000,000\).

3. **Case 1: One Variable is 200**:
   Assume \(a = 200\). Then \(b + c = 100\). The equation becomes:
   \[
   4,000,000 + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000 \implies f(b) + f(c) = 2,000,000
   \]
   The only solution is \(b = 100\) and \(c = 0\) (or permutations thereof). This gives 6 valid triples:
   \[
   (200, 100, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 200, 0), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200)
   \]

4. **Case 2: All Variables are Equal**:
   Assume \(a = b = c = 100\). Then:
   \[
   a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6 \times 100^3 = 6,000,000
   \]
   This gives one additional valid triple:
   \[
   (100, 100, 100)
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   Combining both cases, there are a total of \(6 + 1 = 7\) valid triples.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
