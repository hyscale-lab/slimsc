Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says that a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. 

My task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me break down the problem.

First, let's think about what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, the two-digit numbers range from b (which is 10_b) to b² - 1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b). So, in decimal, the number n must satisfy b ≤ n ≤ b² - 1. 

But n is also equal to the sum of its two digits times the base plus the units digit. Let me represent the two-digit number in base b as d1 d0, where d1 and d0 are the digits. So, n = d1*b + d0. 

The sum of the digits is d1 + d0, and according to the problem, this sum must equal sqrt(n). So, we have:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it or find a way to express it differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat this as a quadratic equation in terms of d1 or d0.

Wait, let's think about the constraints on d1 and d0. Since they are digits in base b, d1 must be at least 1 (since it's a two-digit number) and at most b-1. Similarly, d0 can be from 0 to b-1.

So, d1 ranges from 1 to b-1, and d0 ranges from 0 to b-1.

Also, since n must be a perfect square (because sqrt(n) must be an integer, as it's the sum of two integers d1 and d0), so n is a square number between b and b² - 1.

Wait, that's an important point. So n must be a perfect square in that range. So for each base b, I'm looking for perfect squares n such that when written in base b, they have two digits, and the sum of the digits equals sqrt(n).

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this by letting s = d1 + d0, so sqrt(n) = s. Then, n = s². Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b ≤ s² ≤ b² - 1.

So, for each base b, I can iterate over possible s such that s² is within [b, b² - 1], and then check if s² can be written in base b with two digits d1 and d0 where d1 + d0 = s.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express s² as d1*b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits (d1 >=1,
