Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because I think drawing a diagram will help me understand the relationships between the rectangles and the points mentioned.

Alright, the problem says there are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic or lie on the same circle. 

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

First, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17.

Wait, let me make sure I have the sides right. In rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths. So, AB = 107, BC = 16. So, the rectangle is longer along AB and CD, and shorter along BC and AD.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF is 184, FG is 17. So, EF and GH are the longer sides, and FG and EH are the shorter sides.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line in that order? Or maybe a different order? Hmm, the way it's written, D, E, C, F are in a straight line. So, starting from D, moving to E, then to C, then to F. So, D---E---C---F on a straight line.

Additionally, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That must mean that these four points are concyclic, so they lie on the circumference of the same circle.

I think I should assign coordinates to these points to make it easier to work with. Let me choose a coordinate system where point D is at the origin (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, I can assign coordinates to A, B, C, D.

Let me think: if D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC = 16, AD = 16. So, point A would be at (0, 16). Then, AB is 107, so moving from A to B is along the x-axis, so B would be at (107, 16). Then, point C would be at (107, 0), since it's directly below B. So, ABCD has coordinates: A(0,16), B(107,16), C(107,0), D(0,0).

Now, let's consider rectangle EFGH. Since points D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). So, the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). Points E and F must lie somewhere on this line.

Given that EFGH is a rectangle, and FG = 17, EF = 184. So, EFGH must be placed such that E and F lie on the x-axis, and the rectangle extends upward or downward from there. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is 184, which is a long side, so EF is one of the longer sides.

Wait, but EF is 184, FG is 17. So, EF is the length, FG is the width. So, if E and F are on the x-axis, then G and H would be either above or below the x-axis.

But since points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, and A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), so H and G must also lie somewhere such that all four points lie on a circle.

Hmm, perhaps the circle is the circumcircle of rectangle EFGH? Wait, no, because EFGH is a rectangle; its circumcircle would have its center at the intersection of its diagonals and radius equal to half the diagonal length. But A, D, H, G are on a circle, so maybe they form another rectangle or something?

Wait, let's get back to assigning coordinates.

Let me denote point E as (e, 0) and point F as (f, 0). Since E and F are on the x-axis between D(0,0) and C(107,0
