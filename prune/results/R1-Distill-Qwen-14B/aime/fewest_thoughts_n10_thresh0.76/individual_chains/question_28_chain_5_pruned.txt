Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths and find the distance from a certain point inside it to each face. Hmm, the tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and the edges have some symmetrical lengths. Let me try to visualize this.

Given:
AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems like a special kind of tetrahedron. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron might be isohedral or something similar, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.

The point I is inside the tetrahedron such that its distance to each face is equal. That point is called the incenter, right? In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, similar to the incenter in a triangle. So, this distance is like the radius of the inscribed sphere (inradius) of the tetrahedron.

So, the problem is to find the inradius of this tetrahedron. The formula for the inradius 'r' of a tetrahedron is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. But wait, in a tetrahedron, the formula is a bit different. Let me recall: in a tetrahedron, the inradius is indeed 3 times the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces. So, r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4), where A1, A2, A3, A4 are the areas of each face.

So, to find r, I need to compute the volume V and the areas of all four faces.

But first, let me see if I can find the volume. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, maybe I can use a formula for the volume in such cases. Alternatively, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to calculate the volume.

Yes, placing it in a coordinate system might be a good approach. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that calculations are easier.

Let me think. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way. Maybe I can place the points such that midpoints of opposite edges coincide or something. Alternatively, maybe I can set some points along coordinate axes to simplify things.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume. I remember that the volume of a tetrahedron can be found using the determinant of a matrix constructed from the edge lengths. That might be a good approach here, especially since all edges are given.

Yes, let me recall the Cayley-Menger determinant formula. The volume V is given by:

288 VÂ² = | CM |

where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a determinant of a matrix constructed from the edge lengths. For a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e
