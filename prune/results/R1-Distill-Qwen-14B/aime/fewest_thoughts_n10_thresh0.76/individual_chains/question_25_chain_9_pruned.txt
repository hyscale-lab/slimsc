Okay, so I've got this problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which I guess means that's a given for everyone. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. 

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- And everyone owns candy hearts, so that's 900.

Additionally, it says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things and 234 who own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things.

Hmm, okay. So this seems like a problem involving sets and their intersections. I remember that for problems like this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. But since there are four sets here (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts), it can get a bit complicated. Also, the fact that everyone owns candy hearts might simplify things because that set is universal.

Let me define the sets:
- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring. So |D| = 195.
- Let G be the set of people who own golf clubs. So |G| = 367.
- Let S be the set of people who own a garden spade. So |S| = 562.
- Let C be the set of people who own candy hearts. Since everyone owns this, |C| = 900.

We're told that 437 own exactly two things, 234 own exactly three, and we need to find how many own all four.

In inclusion-exclusion problems, the formula for four sets can be a bit complex, but maybe since C is the universal set, it might simplify things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Venn diagram regions.

I remember that for four sets, the inclusion-exclusion formula can get really long, but since all the residents own C, which is the candy hearts, it's like all other sets are subsets of C. So perhaps we can ignore C in our calculations beyond knowing that it's the universal set.

Let me think about the total number of residents, which is 900. So the sum of all the individual ownerships plus the overlaps, but adjusted for overcounting, should equal 900.

Wait, but actually, each resident owns at least one thingâ€”candy hearts, so the total number of residents is 900, which is the same as the total in the union of all four sets. But since C is universal, the union is just C, which has 900.

But maybe I should think about the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets first, and then see how to extend it to four. Wait, but actually, the problem is about four things, but since C is universal, perhaps it's equivalent to three sets (D, G, S) with the universe being C.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider all four sets
