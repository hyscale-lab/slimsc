Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem states that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall some basic definitions. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, while the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use some properties related to the incenter and circumradius here.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check if that's correct. Yes, I think that's Euler's formula relating the inradius, circumradius, and the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. So, OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Given R is 13 and r is 6, let me compute OI².

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6
= 169 - 156
= 13.

So, OI = sqrt(13). Okay, that's useful.

Now, we also know that IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me try to visualize this. IA is the segment from incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the segment from incenter I to circumcenter O. These two are perpendicular. So, the triangle formed by points I, A, and O is a right-angled triangle at I.

So, triangle IAO is right-angled at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:

IA² + OI² = AO².

Wait, AO is the distance from vertex A to the circumcenter O. But in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the circumcenter can be related to the sides of the triangle.

Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the circumcenter can be found using the formula: AO = R. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, in a triangle, the circumradius R is the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex. So, AO = R = 13. Wait, but AO is from A to O, which is the circumradius, so AO is indeed 13. Hmm, that might not be correct because in some cases, like in obtuse triangles, the circumradius is outside, but regardless, AO is always equal to R, which is 13.

Wait, but if AO is 13, then in triangle IAO, which is right-angled at I, we have IA² + OI² = AO². Plugging in the known values:

IA² + (sqrt(13))² = 13²
IA² + 13 = 169
IA² = 169 -13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Okay, so IA is 2√39.

Hmm, but how does this help me find AB*AC?

I remember that the length of the inradius (r) can be related to the area (Δ) and the semiperimeter (s) of the triangle by the formula r = Δ/s.

Also, the area can be expressed in terms of the circumradius R and the sides of the triangle as Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities. Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe setting up coordinate axes would help. Let me try that.

Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0),
