Okay, so I've got this problem from Aimeville, and I need to find the number of residents who own all four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let me see how I can approach this.

First, I remember that this is a problem involving sets and their intersections. It probably uses the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I've heard of that before—it's a way to calculate the union of multiple sets by including and excluding their intersections appropriately.

Let me note down all the given information to organize my thoughts.

Total residents: 900.

Number owning each item:
- Diamond ring (D): 195
- Golf clubs (G): 367
- Garden spade (S): 562
- Candy hearts (C): Well, actually, every resident owns a candy heart, so that's 900.

Wait, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So C = 900.

Additionally, we know:
- Residents who own exactly two of these things: 437.
- Residents who own exactly three of these things: 234.

We need to find the number who own all four, which I'll denote as x.

Hmm, okay. So, let's think about it. The principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets is a bit complex, but maybe I can model this with a Venn diagram approach.

The formula for the union of four sets D, G, S, C is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since every resident owns at least a candy heart, the union |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| is equal to the total number of residents, which is 900. Because even if someone doesn't own any of D, G, or S, they still own C, so they're included in the union.

So, the equation becomes:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since C is owned by everyone, every intersection with C is actually the same as the other set. For example, |D∩C| is just |D|, because everyone who owns D also owns C. Similarly, all the pairwise intersections involving C are equal to the sizes of the other sets. Let me think about that.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because if someone
