Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by revolving a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside and outside this sphere. When it's inside, it's internally tangent to the sphere along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I think this involves understanding the geometry of the torus and how it touches the sphere in these two different configurations.

First, let me recall the properties of a torus. The torus can be described using two radii: R, the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus), and r, the minor radius (radius of the tube itself). In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is resting inside, the sphere is larger. The torus will be tangent to the sphere at some points, forming a circle of radius r_i. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's like the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle with radius r_o.

Wait, actually, no. When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, it's like the sphere is enclosing the torus. So the sphere's surface will just touch the torus at points that form a circle. Similarly, when the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch at another circle.

I think I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency. Let me consider both cases.

Case 1: Torus inside the sphere (internally tangent). The sphere is bigger, so the torus fits inside. The point of tangency will be the point on the torus that's farthest from the center of the sphere. Wait, no, perhaps it's the point where the sphere just touches the torus without intersecting it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the torus and sphere mathematically and find their points of tangency.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's place the center of the sphere at the origin (0,0,0). The torus is symmetric, so let's align its axis of revolution along the z-axis. So the center of the generating circle is at (R, 0, 0) where R is 6. The generating circle has radius r = 3.

So, the parametric equations for the torus can be written as:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

where θ and φ are angles varying from 0 to 2π.

But maybe that's more complicated than I need. Perhaps I should think about the distance from the origin to a point on the torus. For tangency, the distance from the origin to the torus should equal the sphere's radius, which is 11, in both cases. But wait, when the torus is inside, the sphere is outside, and when it's outside, the sphere is inside. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to the torus.

Wait, actually, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere must touch the torus at its farthest point from the origin. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere would touch at the closest point.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the sphere and torus equations and find the conditions for tangency. The sphere has equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

The torus can be represented by the equation sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = R ± sqrt((z - R)^2 + r^2). Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, the standard equation for a torus centered at the origin with the z-axis as its axis is:

( sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R )^2 + z^2 = r^2.

So in this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So the equation is:

( sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 )^2 + z^2 = 9.

Yes, that's correct.

So now, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. So, the points of tangency satisfy both equations, and the gradients (normals) at those points are the same. Similarly for the external tangency.

So, let's find the points where the torus and sphere are tangent.

First, internal tangency. The sphere is larger, so the torus is inside it. The points of tangency would be the points on the torus that are farthest from the origin. Because the sphere touches the torus at its outermost points.

Alternatively, the sphere's surface is tangent to the torus, meaning that at the point of tangency, their normals are colinear.

So, to find the points of tangency
