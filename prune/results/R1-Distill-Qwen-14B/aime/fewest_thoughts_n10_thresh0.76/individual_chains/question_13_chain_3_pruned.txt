Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's walking and coffee breaks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says she walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops at a coffee shop. 

First, when she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, her entire walk takes 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes at the coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including 't' minutes. We need to find out how long her walk will take if she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the coffee time.

Alright, let me break this down. I think I need to set up equations based on the information given. 

When she walks at speed 's', the time taken for the walk without coffee would be distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours. But the total time is 4 hours, which includes the coffee time 't' minutes. Wait, t is in minutes, so I need to convert that to hours to keep the units consistent. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, the first equation would be:
Walk time at speed s + coffee time = total time.
Which is:
9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, when she walks at speed 's + 2', the walk time without coffee is 9/(s + 2) hours. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.

So the second equation is:
9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these equations to find s and t.

Let me write them again:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, maybe subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t. 

So subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4
Simplify this:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me combine the terms on the left:

9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the difference inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So substituting back:

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

So 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Now, let me solve for s. Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2):

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

So equation becomes:

18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

Let me rearrange this:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply all terms by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, 1.6 *10=16, 3.2*10=32, 18*10=180. So yes:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, let me check: 1.6 s^2 *10 is 16 s^2, 3.2 s *10=32 s, 18 *10=180. Yes.

Now, let's simplify this equation. Perhaps divide all terms by 4 to make it simpler:

(16/4)s^2 + (32/4)s - (180/4) = 0
Which is:
4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

Now, quadratic equation: 4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0.

Let me apply the quadratic formula. s = [ -b ± sqrt(b^2 -4ac) ] / (2a)

Here, a =4, b=8, c=-45.

Compute discriminant D = b^2 -4ac = 8^2 -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784.

sqrt(D) = sqrt(784) = 28.

So s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2*4) = [ -8 ± 28 ] /8

We can discard the negative solution because speed can't be negative.

So s = ( -8 +28 ) /8 = 20 /8 = 2.5.

So s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, 2.5 km/h seems a bit slow for a walking speed. Maybe, but let's proceed.

Now, let's find t.

From the first equation: 9/s + t/60 =4.

s is 2.5, so 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So 3.6 + t/60 =4.

Subtract 3.6 from both sides: t/60 = 0.4.

Multiply both sides by 60: t=24 minutes.

So t is 24 minutes.

Now, the problem asks: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. So s is 2.5, so s + 1/2= 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time including t minutes.

So, walk time is 9/(s + 1/2) =9/3=3 hours.

Plus t=24 minutes, so total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

But wait, the question says to find the number of minutes including t minutes.

3 hours is 180 minutes, so 180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Because sometimes in these problems, the coffee time is included in the total time, but in the first two cases, it's included. So when we change the speed, the coffee time remains the same, so yes, we add t.

So, 3 hours walking plus 24 minutes coffee: 3*60 +24= 180+24=204 minutes.

So the answer is 204 minutes.

Wait, just to double
