Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y and z in terms of x, and then plug back into one of the equations.

But let me see: I have x = 2^(-7/24). Let me compute 2^(-7/24). Maybe it's helpful to express all variables in terms of exponents of 2.

Let me denote x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c.

Then, equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)

So, 2^a / (2^b * 2^c) = 2^(1/2) => 2^(a - b - c) = 2^(1/2)

Therefore, a - b - c = 1/2  — equation (1a)

Similarly, equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)

So, 2^b / (2^a * 2^c) = 2^(1/3) => 2^(b - a - c) = 2^(1/3)

Thus, b - a - c = 1/3 — equation (2a)

Equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)

So, 2^c / (2^a * 2^b) = 2^(1/4) => 2^(c - a - b) = 2^(1/4)

Thus, c - a - b = 1/4 — equation (3a)

So now I have a system of three equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. b - a - c = 1/3
3. c - a - b = 1/4

Hmm, okay, let's write them as:

Equation (1a): a - b - c = 1/2

Equation (2a): -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation (3a): -a - b + c = 1/4

This is a linear system in variables a, b, c.

Let me write it in matrix form:

[1  -1  -1 | 1/2]

[-1 1  -1 | 1/3]

[-1 -1 1 | 1/4]

I need to solve for a, b, c.

Maybe adding all three equations together:

(1 -1 -1)a + (-1 +1 -1)b + (-1 -1 +1)c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Wait, no, that approach might not be straightforward. Alternatively, I can solve the system step by step.

Let me number the equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2 — equation (1a)
2. -a + b - c = 1/3 — equation (2a)
3. -a - b + c = 1/4 — equation (3a)

Let me try to eliminate variables.

First, add equation (1a) and equation (2a):

Equation (1a) + (2a): (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3

Simplifies to: 0a
