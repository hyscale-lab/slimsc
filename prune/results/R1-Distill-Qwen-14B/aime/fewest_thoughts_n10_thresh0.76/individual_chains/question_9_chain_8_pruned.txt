Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are greater than 1. Let me read the problem again carefully.

It says: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. So, both expressions equal 10. I need to find xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some basic properties. Let me write down what I know.

First, let's translate the logarithmic equations into exponential form. I'll do this step by step.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a), I can simplify this.

So, log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, is that right? Yeah, because the exponent x can be moved in front as a multiplier. So that's correct.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, applying the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10

2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. Now, let me think about how to relate these two. I notice that both equations involve log_x(y) and log_y(x). I remember that log_b(a) and log_a(b) are reciprocals of each other. Let me verify that.

Yes, because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, if I let log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k.

That's a useful relationship. Let me assign variables to make this easier.

Let me set k = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) = 1/k.

So, substituting into the equations:

1) x * k = 10

2) 4y * (1/k) = 10

So, equation 1 becomes x*k = 10.

Equation 2 becomes (4y)/k = 10.

Now, I have two equations:

1) xk = 10

2) (4y)/k = 10

I can try to solve these equations for x and y in terms of k, and then find k.

From equation 1: x = 10 / k.

From equation 2: 4y = 10k â†’ y = (10k) / 4 = (5k)/2.

So, now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k.

But I also know that k is log_x(y). Let me express that in terms of k.

Since k = log_x(y), that means x^k = y.

Wait, that's another property of logarithms. If log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a.

So, x^k = y.

But from earlier, x = 10/k and y = (5k)/2.

So, substituting x and y into this equation: (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can solve for k.

Let me write it again:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2

Let me take both sides and see if I can manipulate them.

First, let's write 10/k as 10 * (1/k). So, (10/k)^k = (10)^k * (1/k)^k.

Which is 10^k / k^k.

So, 10^k / k^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that might not help directly, but maybe taking logarithms on both sides would help.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides.

ln(10^k / k^k) = ln( (5k)/2 )

Using logarithm rules, the left side is ln(10^k) - ln(k^k) = k ln(10) - k ln(k).

The right side is ln(5k/2) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2).

So, putting it together:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

I can factor out k on the left:

k [ ln(10) - ln(k) ] = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can express ln(10) as ln(2*5) = ln(2) + ln(5). Let's see.

Left side: k [ ln(2) + ln(5) - ln(k) ]

Right side: ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Hmm, perhaps rearranging terms would help.

Bring all terms to one side:

k [ ln(2) + ln(5) - ln(k) ] - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider substituting variables or looking for an integer solution.

Wait, since x and y are both greater than 1, and k is log_x(y), which would be positive. Also, since x and y are greater than 1, k is positive as well.

Let me try to
