Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer such that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number, the largest possible, with this special property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. That's interesting. So, for example, if N is abcd, then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, which is divisible by 7; changing b to 1 gives a1cd, which is also divisible by 7; same with c and d. So all four possible single-digit changes to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7.

I need to find the largest N possible with this property. Then, once I have N, I divide it by 1000, get Q as the quotient and R as the remainder, and add them together.

Alright, let me think about how to approach this. Since N is a four-digit number, it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest N, so I'll probably start checking numbers from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the condition. But that seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = WXYZ, where W, X, Y, Z are its digits, with W being the thousands digit, X the hundreds, Y the tens, and Z the units. So, N = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z.

The condition is that if we replace any one digit with 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.

So, replacing W with 1: 1XYZ = 1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z. This number must be divisible by 7.

Replacing X with 1: W1YZ = 1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z. This must be divisible by 7.

Replacing Y with 1: WX1Z = 1000W + 100X + 10 + Z. Divisible by 7.

Replacing Z with 1: WXY1 = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1. Divisible by 7.

So, all four modified numbers must be divisible by 7. Hmm, that's four conditions. Maybe I can express each of these conditions in terms of N and the digit being changed.

Let me try that. Let's denote the original number N as 1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z.

When we replace a digit with 1, the new number can be written as:

1. If we replace W with 1: N' = 1000*1 + 100X + 10Y + Z = 1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z.
   So, N' = 1000 + (N - 1000W). Because N = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z, so N - 1000W = 100X + 10Y + Z.

So, N' = 1000 + (N - 1000W). And this must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, for replacing X with 1: N'' = 1000W + 100*1 + 10Y + Z = 1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z.
Which is N'' = (N - 100X) + 100. Since N = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z, so N - 100X = 1000W + 10Y + Z. So N'' = (1000W + 10Y + Z) + 100.

Similarly, replacing Y with 1: N''' = 1000W + 100X + 10*1 + Z = 1000W + 100X + 10 + Z, which is N''' = (N - 10Y) + 10.

Replacing Z with 1: N'''' = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1 = N - Z + 1.

So, all four modified numbers can be expressed in terms of N and the digit being replaced.

Let me write each condition as a divisibility by 7:

1. (1000 + (N - 1000W)) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. ((N - 100X) + 100) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. ((N - 10Y) + 10) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. (N - Z + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

So, these are four congruence conditions that N must satisfy.

Alternatively, we can write each condition as:

1. 1000 + (N - 1000W) ≡ 0 mod 7 → (N - 1000W) ≡ -1000 mod 7
2. (N - 100X) + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (N - 100X) ≡ -100 mod 7
3. (N - 10Y) + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (N - 10Y) ≡ -10 mod 7
4. (N - Z) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (N - Z) ≡ -1 mod 7

Hmm, but I don't know what W, X, Y, Z are. Maybe I can express N in terms of its digits and then see.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the original number N modulo 7. Since all four modified numbers must be ≡0 mod 7, perhaps I can express each modified number in terms of N.

Let me consider the first condition: changing W to 1. Let me denote D as the digit which is W, so when I change W to 1, the number becomes 1XYZ. Then, 1XYZ - N = (1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z) - (1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z) = 1000 - 1000W = 1000(1 - W).

So, 1XYZ = N + 1000(1 - W). And since 1XYZ is divisible by 7, N + 1000(1 - W) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, when changing X to 1, the new number is W1YZ. W1YZ - N = (100W + 100 + 10Y + Z) - (1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z) = 100W + 100 - 1000W - 100X = -900W + 100 - 100X.

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe better to think in terms of the modified number.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express each modified number in terms of N and the digit being changed.

Wait, let's see: For each digit, when we replace it with 1, the difference between the modified number and N is 1*10^k - D*10^k, where D is the original digit, and k is the position (from 0 for units to 3 for thousands).

Wait, that might be a better way. Let me think:
