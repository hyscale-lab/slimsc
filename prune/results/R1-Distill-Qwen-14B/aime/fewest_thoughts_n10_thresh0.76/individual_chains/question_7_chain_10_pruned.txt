Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's 50% red and 50% blue for each one. The question is about finding the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention expressing this probability as m/n where m and n are coprime, and then finding m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, the octagon has 8 vertices, right? Each can be red or blue. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That will be our denominator n when we express the probability.

Now, the numerator m is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to the original red positions. Let me think about what that means. Essentially, we need a rotation such that every blue vertex in the original coloring moves to a position that was originally red. But wait, how do we ensure that the rotation exists?

I think this has something to do with the concept of group actions in combinatorics, maybe Burnside's lemma. Burnside's lemma relates the number of orbits of a set under a group action to the average number of fixed points of the group elements. But I'm not entirely sure how to apply it here.

Wait, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider the rotations of the octagon. The octagon has rotational symmetries of order 8, corresponding to rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°. Each rotation can be represented as a permutation of the vertices.

So, the problem is asking for colorings where there's some rotation (other than the identity, maybe?) such that applying that rotation will swap the colors. But wait, not exactly swap, but map the blue vertices to the red ones.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a permutation. Each rotation is a permutation of the vertices. Suppose I have a permutation σ which is a rotation, and I want σ to map the set B (blue vertices) to the complement of B, which is the set R (red vertices). So σ(B) = R.

But since the octagon is regular, any rotation that maps B to R must satisfy σ^k(B) = R for some k. But also, since R is the complement of B, σ^k(B) must equal the complement of B, which implies that σ^k is an involution on B? Wait, maybe not necessarily. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since σ is a rotation, it's a cyclic permutation. So maybe what I need is that the coloring is such that when you rotate it by some multiple of 45°, all the blue vertices move to red positions and vice versa. So the coloring must be symmetric with respect to some rotation such that blue and red are swapped.

But wait, is that possible? Because the octagon is regular, any rotation can be composed with the color swap, but the color swap isn't a symmetry unless the coloring is symmetric in a certain way.

Alternatively,
