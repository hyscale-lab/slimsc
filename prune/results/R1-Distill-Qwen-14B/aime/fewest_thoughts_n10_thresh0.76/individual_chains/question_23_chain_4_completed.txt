Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a rhombus on a hyperbola. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

We have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. The question asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, I need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible such rhombuses and then give the greatest number less than that.

Hmm, rhombus properties: All sides are equal, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, not necessarily. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, I think that's correct. So the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin. So the points A, B, C, D are symmetric with respect to the origin. 

Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are points B and D. So if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, etc.

But maybe it's easier to work with coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to A and B, then express the rest in terms of those.

Let’s denote A as (x, y) and B as (u, v). Then, since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.

Wait, let me think again. The diagonals are AC and BD. So the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD is (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So (y/x) * (v/u) = -1.

Which implies yv = -xu.

That's one condition.

Another condition is that all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C.

Wait, let's write the distances.

Distance AB: sqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2]
Distance BC: sqrt[(-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2]

Set them equal:

sqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2] = sqrt[(-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2]

Squaring both sides:

(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (u^2 - 2ux + x^2) + (v^2 - 2vy + y^2)
Right side: (x^2 + 2ux + u^2) + (y^2 + 2vy + v^2)

So,

Left: u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y²
Right: x² + 2ux + u² + y² + 2vy + v²

Subtract left from right:

0 = [x² + 2ux + u² + y² + 2vy + v²] - [u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y²]

Simplify:

0 = (2ux - (-2ux)) + (2vy - (-2vy))

Which is:

0 = 4ux + 4vy

Divide both sides by 4:

ux + vy = 0

So, we have another condition: ux + vy = 0.

But we already had yv = -xu from the slopes.

Wait, so from the slopes, yv = -xu. So, substituting into ux + vy = 0.

Let me write that:

From yv = -xu, so uy = -vx.

Wait, but in the condition ux + vy = 0, substituting y = (-xu)/v from the first equation.

Wait, perhaps I should express one variable in terms of the others.

Wait, let's see.

We have two equations:

1. yv = -xu
2. ux + vy = 0

Let me plug equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1, yv = -xu, so we can write equation 2 as:

ux + v*(-xu/v) = 0

Wait, because y = (-xu)/v.

Wait, substitution: equation 2 is ux + vy = 0.

Substitute y from equation 1: y = (-xu)/v.

So equation 2 becomes:

ux + v*(-xu/v) = ux - xu = 0

Which is 0=0. Hmm, that's always true, so it's not giving any new information.

So, the two conditions are not independent. So perhaps I need another condition.

Wait, maybe the fact that all four points lie on the hyperbola.

So, points A(x,y), B(u,v), C(-x,-y), D(-u,-v) must all lie on the hyperbola (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1.

So, for point A: (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1  ...(3)

Similarly, for point B: (u²)/20 - (v²)/24 = 1  ...(4)

So, equations (3) and (4) must hold.

So, we have equations (1), (3), (4), and the rhombus conditions.

Wait, but perhaps I can model the points A and B such that the diagonals are perpendicular and the distances are equal.

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize points on the hyperbola.

Wait, hyperbola parametrization: For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, a parametrization can be (a secθ, b tanθ). Alternatively, since hyperbola can also be parametrized using hyperbolic functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). But since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps using angle parameters is better.

Wait, let me think: For hyperbola, the standard parametrization is (a secθ, b tanθ). So for our hyperbola, a²=20, so a=2√5, and b²=24, so b=2√6.

So, let’s parametrize points A and B as:

A: (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ)
B: (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ)

Then, points C and D are (-2√5 secθ, -2√6 tanθ) and (-2√5 secφ, -2√6 tanφ), respectively.

Now, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is already satisfied because of the symmetry.

Now, the diagonals are AC and BD.

Slope of AC: (y_C - y_A)/(x_C - x_A) = (-2√6 tanθ - 2√6 tanθ)/(-2√5 secθ - 2√5 secθ)

Which simplifies to (-4√6 tanθ)/(-4√5 secθ) = (√6 tanθ)/(√5 secθ) = (√6/√5) sinθ.

Similarly, slope of BD: (v_D - v_B)/(u_D - u_B) = (-2√6 tanφ - 2√6 tanφ)/(-2√5 secφ - 2√5 secφ)

Which is (-4√6 tanφ)/(-4√5 secφ) = (√6 tanφ)/(√5 secφ) = (√6/√5) sinφ.

Since diagonals are perpendicular, product of their slopes is -1.

So,

(√6/√5 sinθ) * (√6/√5 sinφ) = -1

Which is (6/5) sinθ sinφ = -1

So,

sinθ sinφ = -5/6

Hmm, that's one equation.

Now, the other condition comes from the fact that ABCD is a rhombus, so all sides are equal.

So, the distance AB must equal BC.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute vectors AB and AD and set their magnitudes equal.

Wait, but maybe using coordinates.

Point A: (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ)
Point B: (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ)
Point C: (-2√5 secθ, -2√6 tanθ)
Point D: (-2√5 secφ, -2√6 tanφ)

So, vector AB: (2√5 (secφ - secθ), 2√6 (tanφ - tanθ))
Vector BC: (-2√5 (secθ + secφ), -2√6 (tanθ + tanφ))

Wait, the length of AB and BC should be equal.

Compute the squared distances:

|AB|² = [2√5 (secφ - secθ)]² + [2√6 (tanφ - tanθ)]²
|BC|² = [-2√5 (secθ + secφ)]² + [-2√6 (tanθ + tanφ)]²

Set them equal:

[2√5 (secφ - secθ)]² + [2√6 (tanφ - tanθ)]² = [2√5 (secθ + secφ)]² + [2√6 (tanθ + tanφ)]²

Divide both sides by (2√5)^2 and (2√6)^2 to simplify.

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term on left: [2√5 (secφ - secθ)]² = 20 (secφ - secθ)^2
Second term on left: [2√6 (tanφ - tanθ)]² = 24 (tanφ - tanθ)^2

Similarly, right side:

First term: 20 (secθ + secφ)^2
Second term: 24 (tanθ + tanφ)^2

So, equation becomes:

20 (secφ - secθ)^2 + 24 (tanφ - tanθ)^2 = 20 (secθ + secφ)^2 + 24 (tanθ + tanφ)^2

Let me move all terms to the left:

20[(secφ - secθ)^2 - (secθ + secφ)^2] +24[(tanφ - tanθ)^2 - (tanθ + tanφ)^2] = 0

Let me expand each bracket.

First, for the sec terms:

(secφ - secθ)^2 - (secφ + secθ)^2 = [sec²φ - 2 secφ secθ + sec²θ] - [sec²φ + 2 secφ secθ + sec²θ] = -4 secφ secθ

Similarly, for tan terms:

(tanφ - tanθ)^2 - (tanφ + tanθ)^2 = [tan²φ - 2 tanφ tanθ + tan²θ] - [tan²φ + 2 tanφ tanθ + tan²θ] = -4 tanφ tanθ

So, the equation becomes:

20*(-4 secφ secθ) + 24*(-4 tanφ tanθ) = 0

Factor out -4:

-4[20 secφ secθ + 24 tanφ tanθ] = 0

Which implies:

20 secφ secθ + 24 tanφ tanθ = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

5 secφ secθ + 6 tanφ tanθ = 0

So, 5 secφ secθ = -6 tanφ tanθ

Express sec in terms of cos, and tan in terms of sin/cos.

5 (1/cosφ)(1/cosθ) = -6 (sinφ/cosφ)(sinθ/cosθ)

Simplify:

5/(cosφ cosθ) = -6 (sinφ sinθ)/(cosφ cosθ)

Multiply both sides by cosφ cosθ:

5 = -6 sinφ sinθ

So,

sinφ sinθ = -5/6

Wait, but earlier we had from the slopes:

sinθ sinφ = -5/6

So, that's consistent. So, that condition is already satisfied.

Hmm, so that doesn't give any new information. So, perhaps the condition for the sides being equal is automatically satisfied given the slopes are perpendicular. So, perhaps the only condition is that sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

But then, how do we find BD²?

Wait, BD is one of the diagonals. Let me think, BD connects points B and D.

Wait, points B and D are (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ) and (-2√5 secφ, -2√6 tanφ). So, the length BD is the distance between these two points.

Distance BD: sqrt[(-2√5 secφ - 2√5 secφ)^2 + (-2√6 tanφ - 2√6 tanφ)^2]

Simplify:

sqrt[(-4√5 secφ)^2 + (-4√6 tanφ)^2] = sqrt[16*5 sec²φ + 16*6 tan²φ] = 4 sqrt[5 sec²φ + 6 tan²φ]

So, BD² = (4)^2 [5 sec²φ + 6 tan²φ] = 16[5 sec²φ + 6 tan²φ]

So, BD² = 16[5 sec²φ + 6 tan²φ]

But we can express this in terms of sinφ and cosφ. Remember that sec²φ = 1/cos²φ, tan²φ = sin²φ / cos²φ.

So,

BD² = 16[5/cos²φ + 6 sin²φ / cos²φ] = 16[ (5 + 6 sin²φ)/cos²φ ]

Hmm, perhaps we can write this in terms of sinφ.

But we also have that sinθ sinφ = -5/6. But we might need another relation between θ and φ.

Wait, perhaps we can express cos²φ in terms of sinφ.

Alternatively, since points A and B are on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 =1.

Wait, for point B, which is (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ), substituting into hyperbola equation:

( (2√5 secφ)^2 ) /20 - ( (2√6 tanφ)^2 ) /24 =1

Compute:

(4*5 sec²φ)/20 - (4*6 tan²φ)/24 =1

Simplify:

(20 sec²φ)/20 - (24 tan²φ)/24 =1

Which becomes:

sec²φ - tan²φ =1

But sec²φ - tan²φ =1 is a trigonometric identity, which always holds. So, that doesn't give any new information.

Hmm, so perhaps we need another approach. Let's see.

We have BD² = 16[5 sec²φ + 6 tan²φ]

We can express this as 16[5/cos²φ + 6 sin²φ/cos²φ] = 16[(5 + 6 sin²φ)/cos²φ]

Express in terms of sinφ.

Let me write in terms of sinφ:

Let’s recall that sin²φ = s, so cos²φ = 1 - s.

So,

BD² = 16*(5 + 6s)/(1 - s)

So, BD² is a function of s, where s = sin²φ.

We need to find the minimal value of BD² given that sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Wait, but we have to relate θ and φ. So, perhaps we can express sinθ in terms of sinφ.

From earlier, sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

So, sinθ = (-5)/(6 sinφ)

But sinθ must be between -1 and 1, so:

| (-5)/(6 sinφ) | ≤1

Which implies |5/(6 sinφ)| ≤1 → |sinφ| ≥5/6

So, |sinφ| ≥5/6, which implies that sin²φ ≥25/36.

So, s ≥25/36, since s = sin²φ.

So, s ≥25/36.

So, our function for BD² is BD² =16*(5 +6s)/(1 - s), where s ≥25/36.

We need to find the minimal BD², because the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD² is the minimal value BD² can take, and hence, the answer is just below that.

So, let’s analyze BD² as a function of s, s ≥25/36.

Define f(s) = (5 +6s)/(1 - s), with s ≥25/36.

We can compute f(s) = (5 +6s)/(1 - s).

To find the minimal value of f(s), let's find the derivative and see if it's increasing or decreasing.

Compute derivative f’(s):

f’(s) = [6*(1 - s) - (5 +6s)*(-1)] / (1 - s)^2

Simplify numerator:

6(1 - s) + (5 +6s) = 6 -6s +5 +6s =11

So, f’(s) =11/(1 - s)^2

Since denominator is positive, and numerator is positive, f’(s) is always positive for s <1. Thus, f(s) is strictly increasing on the interval (25/36,1).

Therefore, the minimal value of f(s) occurs at s=25/36.

So, minimal f(s) is f(25/36)= (5 +6*(25/36))/(1 -25/36)

Compute numerator:

5 + (150/36) = 5 + (25/6) = (30/6 +25/6)=55/6

Denominator:

1 -25/36=11/36

So,

f(25/36)= (55/6)/(11/36)= (55/6)*(36/11)= (55*6)/11=5*6=30

Therefore, minimal BD² is 16*30=480.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no, because f(s)= (5 +6s)/(1 -s), and BD²=16*f(s)=16*(5 +6s)/(1 -s). So when s=25/36, f(s)=30, so BD²=16*30=480.

But wait, hold on. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the calculation.

Compute f(s) when s=25/36:

Numerator: 5 +6*(25/36) =5 + (150/36)=5 + (25/6)= (30/6 +25/6)=55/6≈9.1667

Denominator:1 -25/36=11/36≈0.3056

So f(s)= (55/6)/(11/36)= (55/6)*(36/11)= (55*6)/11= (5*11*6)/11=5*6=30. So yes, f(s)=30, so BD²=16*30=480.

But wait, BD is the diagonal, and in the hyperbola, points can't be too close or too far, but according to this, the minimal BD² is 480.

Wait, but we have to make sure that when s=25/36, θ is such that sinθ = (-5)/(6 sinφ). So sinφ is sqrt(s)=5/6, but wait, since s=25/36, sinφ=5/6 or -5/6.

So, sinφ=5/6 or -5/6.

If sinφ=5/6, then sinθ= (-5)/(6*(5/6))= (-5)/5= -1.

So, sinθ=-1, which is possible, θ= -π/2 or 3π/2.

Similarly, if sinφ=-5/6, then sinθ= (-5)/(6*(-5/6))= (-5)/(-5)=1, so sinθ=1, θ= π/2.

So, these are valid θ and φ.

So, these correspond to points where φ is arcsin(5/6) or arcsin(-5/6), and θ is -π/2 or π/2.

So, points A will be at θ= -π/2 or π/2, meaning that for A, the coordinates are (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ). Let's compute for θ=π/2.

Wait, sec(π/2) is undefined, as cos(π/2)=0, so sec(π/2) is infinity. So, point A would be at infinity. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. When θ approaches π/2, secθ approaches infinity, so point A goes to infinity. But in our case, when sinθ=-1, θ=-π/2, so cosθ=0, so secθ is undefined. So, point A would be at infinity.

Wait, but in reality, points A and B can't be at infinity because they're on the hyperbola. So, perhaps this suggests that the minimal BD² is achieved when points A and B are at certain positions, but not exactly at θ=-π/2 or π/2 because those are asymptotes.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, when sinθ=-1, which is θ=-π/2, point A is (2√5 sec(-π/2), 2√6 tan(-π/2)), but sec(-π/2) is undefined, so point A is at infinity. Similarly for sinθ=1, point A is at infinity.

So, perhaps BD² approaches 480 as points A and B approach these positions, but can't actually reach it.

Wait, so perhaps 480 is the infimum, but it's not achieved. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi would be 480, but since BD² can't be less than 480, but can approach it arbitrarily closely. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, f(s) is increasing, so as s approaches 25/36 from above, f(s) approaches 30, so BD² approaches 480 from above. So, BD² is always greater than 480, but can get as close as we want to 480. So, the infimum is 480, but BD² can't be less than that.

Wait, but the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, since BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, the greatest number less than all BD² would be 480 itself. Because for any number greater than 480, you can find a rhombus with BD² just above 480, making that number less than BD². But 480 is the infimum.

Wait, but wait, no. The infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, BD² can be as close to 480 as we like, but never less than 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, since BD² is always ≥480. So, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than all BD² is 480.

Wait, but wait. The problem says 'the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.' So, it's the infimum of BD², which is 480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because BD² is always greater than or equal to 480.

But wait, actually, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480. Because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than that number (but BD² can't be less than 480). So, the answer is 480.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. If the infimum is 480, then BD² is always ≥480, so the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombuses is 480, because 480 is the smallest possible value of BD², and BD² can't be smaller than that. So, any number less than 480 would be less than BD² for all rhombuses, but 480 is the greatest such number.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 480.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

We had BD² =16*(5 +6s)/(1 -s), where s = sin²φ, s ≥25/36.

So, f(s) = (5 +6s)/(1 -s). We found that as s approaches 25/36 from above, f(s) approaches 30, so BD² approaches 480.

But when s=25/36, f(s)=30, so BD²=480. However, when s=25/36, sinφ=±5/6, which leads to sinθ=-1 or 1, which makes point A go to infinity, which is not allowed because points A and B must be finite points on the hyperbola.

So, BD² can approach 480 but can't actually reach it. Therefore, the infimum is 480, but it's not attainable. So, BD² can be as close to 480 as we want, but never actually 480. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombuses would be 480, since for any ε>0, there's a rhombus with BD² <480 + ε, but BD² is always ≥480.

Wait, no, the problem says 'the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.' So, that number must be less than every BD². Since BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, then the greatest such number is 480, because if you pick any number greater than 480, say 480 + ε, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than 480 + ε. But 480 is the infimum, so BD² is always ≥480.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it differently. If I have an infimum L, then for any ε>0, there exists a rhombus with BD² < L + ε. So, the greatest number that is less than all BD² is L, because any number larger than L will fail to be less than some BD².

So, in this case, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than all BD² is 480.

Wait, but in reality, BD² can't be less than 480, but can approach it. So, the numbers less than all BD² are all numbers less than or equal to 480. So, the greatest such number is 480.

Yes, that's right. So, the answer is 480.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.


To solve the problem, we consider the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and a rhombus \(ABCD\) with vertices on the hyperbola and diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular, and the rhombus is symmetric about the origin.

We parametrize points \(A\) and \(B\) on the hyperbola using hyperbola parametrization:
- \(A = (2\sqrt{5} \sec\theta, 2\sqrt{6} \tan\theta)\)
- \(B = (2\sqrt{5} \sec\phi, 2\sqrt{6} \tan\phi)\)

The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at the origin, and their slopes are perpendicular, leading to the condition:
\[
\sin\theta \sin\phi = -\frac{5}{6}
\]

We express \(BD^2\) in terms of \(\phi\):
\[
BD^2 = 16 \left(5 \sec^2\phi + 6 \tan^2\phi\right)
\]
Simplifying using trigonometric identities:
\[
BD^2 = 16 \cdot \frac{5 + 6\sin^2\phi}{1 - \sin^2\phi}
\]

Let \(s = \sin^2\phi\). Since \(\sin\theta \sin\phi = -\frac{5}{6}\), we find \(s \geq \frac{25}{36}\). The function \(BD^2\) becomes:
\[
BD^2 = 16 \cdot \frac{5 + 6s}{1 - s}
\]

Analyzing this function, we find it is increasing for \(s \geq \frac{25}{36}\). Thus, the minimum value occurs at \(s = \frac{25}{36}\), giving:
\[
BD^2 = 16 \cdot 30 = 480
\]

Since \(BD^2\) can approach 480 but never be less than it, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombuses is \(\boxed{480}\).
