Okay, let's try to figure out this hexagon problem. Hmm, so ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. That means each side is equal in length, and opposite sides are parallel. Also, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, I remember that in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's called a "parallelogon." But I'm not entirely sure about that term. Anyway, the key here is that opposite sides are parallel and equal in a regular hexagon, but this one is just equilateral, not necessarily regular. So the angles might not all be equal, but all sides are equal.

Since the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300, maybe I can use similar triangles or some proportionality here. Let me visualize the hexagon. Let's denote each side as 's,' which is the side length we need to find.

If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Let me think about how these extensions relate to the hexagon. Each extension is a side of the triangle, which is larger than the hexagon's sides.

Wait, maybe I can consider the concept of similar triangles here. If the sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300, perhaps each side of the triangle is a multiple of the hexagon's side. But how?

Alternatively, I remember that in such hexagons, the extensions of the sides form a triangle where each side is divided by the hexagon into segments. Maybe using the intercept theorem or something like that.

Let me try to break down each side. Let's say when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet at some points to form the triangle. Let me denote the triangle as TUV, where each side corresponds to the extensions.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is similar to the smaller triangles formed within the hexagon. Or maybe the sides of the triangle are related to the sides of the hexagon through some ratio.

I think this might involve the concept of similar triangles where the sides are scaled by some factor. Since the hexagon is equilateral and the opposite sides are parallel,
