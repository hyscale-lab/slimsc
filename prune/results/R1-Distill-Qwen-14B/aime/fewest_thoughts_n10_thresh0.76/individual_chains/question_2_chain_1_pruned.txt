Okay, so I'm trying to solve this coordinate geometry problem. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's parse the problem. We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. Then there's this family F of segments PQ where each PQ is of unit length, lies in the first quadrant, has P on the x-axis, and Q on the y-axis.

So, each segment PQ is like a line segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers because it's in the first quadrant, and the length of PQ is 1. So, we can model this with the equation sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which simplifies to p² + q² = 1.

So, the family F consists of all such segments PQ where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1, and both p and q are positive because we're in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem says that AB is a segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me visualize this. A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, about 0.866 units up. So, the segment AB connects these two points.

We are told that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from the family F except AB itself. So, point C is on AB, and for any other segment PQ in F, C isn't on PQ. Our goal is to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p+q.

Hmm. So, I think the idea is that point C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because each PQ is a line segment that could be part of a family of lines, and the envelope is the curve tangent to all of them. So, maybe AB is tangent to this envelope at point C, which is unique.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model each PQ as a line and find the envelope of all such lines. Then, find where AB intersects this envelope, which would give point C.

So, let's try to find the equation of a general segment PQ. Since P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), the equation of the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. Because it's the intercept form of the line equation.

But we know that sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. So, each line in F is x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1.

Now, to find the envelope of these lines, we can use the method of finding the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter being zero.

In this case, the parameter can be thought of as either p or q, but since p and q are related by p² + q² = 1, maybe it's better to express one variable in terms of the other.

Let me consider parameterizing by an angle θ, where p = cosθ and q = sinθ, since p² + q² = 1. So, θ ranges from 0 to π/2 because p and q are positive.

So, the equation of PQ becomes x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1.

Now, to find the envelope, we can use the method where we take F(x,y,θ) = x/cosθ + y/sinθ - 1 = 0, and compute the partial derivative of F with respect to θ, set it to zero, and solve together with F=0.

So, let's compute ∂F/∂θ.

First, F = x secθ + y cscθ - 1.

So, ∂F/∂θ = x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ.

Set this equal to zero:

x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ = 0.

Let me write that again:

x (secθ tanθ) - y (cscθ cotθ) = 0.

Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this equation.

We know that secθ = 1/cosθ, tanθ = sinθ/cosθ, cscθ = 1/sinθ, cotθ = cosθ/sinθ.

So, substituting:

x [ (1/cosθ) * (sinθ / cosθ) ) ] - y [ (1/sinθ) * (cosθ / sinθ) ) ] = 0

Simplify each term:

First term: x [ (sinθ) / cos²θ ]
Second term: y [ (cosθ) / sin²θ ]

So the equation becomes:

x sinθ / cos²θ - y cosθ / sin²θ = 0

Move one term to the other side:

x sinθ / cos²θ = y cosθ / sin²θ

Multiply both sides by cos²θ sin²θ to eliminate denominators:

x sin³θ = y cos³θ

So, x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

So, from this, we can express y in terms of x:

y = x (sin³θ / cos³θ) ) = x tan³θ.

So, we have y = x tan³θ.

Now, from the original equation F = 0: x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1.

We can substitute y from above into this equation.

So, x/cosθ + (x tan³θ)/sinθ = 1.

Let me simplify tanθ: tanθ = sinθ / cosθ, so tan³θ = (sin³θ)/(cos³θ).

Thus, y = x (sin³θ)/(cos³θ).

So, substituting into F=0:

x / cosθ + [x (sin³θ / cos³θ)] / sinθ = 1.

Simplify the second term:

[x (sin³θ / cos³θ)] / sinθ = x (sin²θ / cos³θ).

So, the equation becomes:

x / cosθ + x (sin²θ / cos³θ) = 1.

Factor out x / cosθ:

x / cosθ [1 + (sin²θ / cos²θ)] = 1.

Note that 1 + (sin²θ / cos²θ) = (cos²θ + sin²θ)/cos²θ = 1 / cos²θ.

So, substituting back:

x / cosθ * (1 / cos²θ) ) = 1.

So, x / cos³θ = 1.

Which gives x = cos³θ.

Now, from earlier, we had y = x tan³θ. Substitute x = cos³θ:

y = cos³θ * tan³θ.

But tanθ = sinθ / cosθ, so tan³θ = (sin³θ)/(cos³θ).

Thus, y = cos³θ * (sin³θ)/(cos³θ) ) = sin³θ.

So, so far, we have x = cos³θ and y = sin³θ.

So, the envelope is parametrized by θ in [0, π/2], with x = cos³θ and y = sin³θ. That's a well-known parametric equation; it's the astroid curve.

Wait, the astroid is usually given by x = a cos³θ, y = a sin³θ, but in this case, a=1, so it's x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ.

So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Let me check that quickly. If x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ, then x^(1/3) = cosθ, y^(1/3) = sinθ. So, (x^(1/3))² + (y^(1/3))² = cos²θ + sin²θ = 1. So, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1. Yep, that's correct.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Now, the problem states that AB is a segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if AB lies on the astroid. Because if AB is part of the envelope, then point C is where AB is tangent to the astroid.

Wait, but AB is a straight line. The astroid is a curve, so perhaps AB is tangent to the astroid at point C, which is unique on AB.

So, perhaps C is the point where AB meets the astroid, and it's the only such point except A and B, which lie on the astroid as well.

Wait, let me check if A is on the astroid. A is at (1/2, 0). Let's plug into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3). (1/2)^(2/3) + 0 = (1/2)^(2/3) which is approximately 0.63, not 1. So, A is not on the astroid. Similarly, B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866). Plugging into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3): 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3). Let's compute that:

(sqrt(3)/2) = (3^(1/2))/2. So, (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) = (3^(1/2))^(2/3) / (2^(2/3)) )= 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3).

Which is approximately 1.442 / 1.587 ≈ 0.909, which is less than 1, so B is also not on the astroid.

Wait, but earlier we thought that AB is part of the envelope, but since A and B are not on the astroid, perhaps AB is a line that's tangent to the astroid at point C.

So, the idea is that AB is a tangent to the astroid at some point C, which is the unique point on AB not lying on any other PQ in F. So, we need to find the point C where AB is tangent to the astroid, and then compute OC².

So, the plan is:

1. Find the equation of AB.

2. Find the condition for AB to be tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

3. Find the point C of tangency.

4. Compute OC².

So, let's proceed.

First, the equation of AB. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the slope first.

Slope m = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2).

So, y = -sqrt(3) x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, that's the equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, to find where this line is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

The condition for a line to be tangent to a curve is that it intersects the curve at exactly one point, and at that point, the line's slope is equal to the derivative of the curve.

So, let's find the points of intersection between AB and the astroid, and then impose that there's exactly one solution, which would give us point C.

Alternatively, using the condition for tangency: substituting y from AB into the astroid equation, and ensuring that the resulting equation has exactly one solution, which would give the condition for the discriminant to be zero.

Let me try that approach.

Substitute y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 into the astroid equation.

So, x^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe we can parametrize the astroid differently.

Wait, the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1. Alternatively, we can use parametric equations: x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ.

So, any point on the astroid can be written as (cos³θ, sin³θ).

The tangent to the astroid at this point can be found by differentiating implicitly.

So, differentiating x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) dx/dy + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0.

Wait, perhaps better to compute dy/dx.

Differentiating implicitly:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) (dy/dx) = 0.

So, solving for dy/dx:

dy/dx = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).

So, the slope of the tangent at (x,y) on the astroid is - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).

Now, the line AB has a slope of -sqrt(3). So, for the line AB to be tangent to the astroid, the slope at the point of tangency must be equal to -sqrt(3).

So, at the point (cos³θ, sin³θ), the slope is:

- ( (sin³θ)^(1/3) ) / ( (cos³θ)^(1/3) ) ) = - (sinθ)/(cosθ) = -tanθ.

Set this equal to -sqrt(3):

-tanθ = -sqrt(3) ⇒ tanθ = sqrt(3) ⇒ θ = π/3.

So, θ = 60 degrees.

Therefore, the point of tangency C is (cos³(π/3), sin³(π/3)).

Compute cos(π/3) = 1/2, so cos³(π/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.

Similarly, sin(π/3) = sqrt(3)/2, so sin³(π/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3*sqrt(3))/8.

So, point C is at (1/8, (3*sqrt(3))/8).

Now, let's verify that this point lies on AB.

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Plugging x = 1/8:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) )= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

Which matches the y-coordinate of C. So, C is correctly found.

So, point C is (1/8, 3√3/8).

Now, compute OC². Since O is at (0,0), OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2.

Compute each term:

(1/8)^2 = 1/64.

(3√3/8)^2 = (9 * 3) / 64 = 27/64.

So, OC² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Wait, that's 7/16. So, p =7, q=16. They are coprime. So, p + q = 23.

Wait
