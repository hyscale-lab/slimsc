Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where I have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let me recall some properties about triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and it's equidistant from all three vertices, which is the circumradius, given as 13. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors and is equidistant from all three sides, with that distance being the inradius, which is 6 here.

The problem mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key piece of information. I'm trying to visualize this. So, in triangle ABC, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. That must mean that triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, OI is perpendicular to IA, making angle OIA a right angle. Interesting.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me verify that. So, R is 13 and r is 6. Plugging in, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). Wait, but in our case, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle OIA, which is right-angled at I, we have sides OI, IA, and OA.

Wait, OA is the circumradius, so OA is 13. So, in triangle OIA, OA is the hypotenuse because it's opposite the right angle at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = OI² + IA². We know OA is 13, so OA² is 169. OI² is 13, as we found earlier. So, 169 = 13 + IA², which means IA² = 169 - 13 = 156, so IA = sqrt(156). I think sqrt(156) can be simplified, but maybe I'll leave it for now.

So, IA = sqrt(156). Hmm, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I wonder if that relates to the formula for the length of the angle bisector or something else. Wait, no, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A, not along the angle bisector. Let me think. There is a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.

I think the formula is IA = (r)/sin(A/2), where r is the inradius. Let me
