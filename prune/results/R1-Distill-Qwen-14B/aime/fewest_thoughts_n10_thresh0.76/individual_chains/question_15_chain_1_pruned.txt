Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, going from the lower left to the upper right would require moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order.

The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the number of ways to arrange these steps. That's a combination problem, right? So, it would be 16 choose 8, which is 12870. But wait, the problem isn't asking for all pathsâ€”it's specifically asking for paths that change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, okay. So, changing direction exactly four times. Let me think about what that means. Each time the path changes direction, it goes from moving right to up or from up to right. So, each direction change is a switch between R and U.

Wait, but the path starts with either R or U. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments, I think. Because each segment is a straight line either to the right or up, and each change in direction starts a new segment. So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many segments does it have?

Let me see. If you start moving right, then change direction to up, that's one change and two segments. Then change back to right, that's two changes and three segments. So, each change adds another segment. So, four changes would mean five segments in total. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or up.

So, the path is made up of five segments, alternating between R and U. But how does that work with the starting direction? If the path starts with R, then the segments go R, U, R, U, R, etc. Or starting with U, it's U, R, U, R, etc.

Wait, but since each direction change is a switch, and we have four changes, that makes five segments. So, for the path that starts with R, the number of
