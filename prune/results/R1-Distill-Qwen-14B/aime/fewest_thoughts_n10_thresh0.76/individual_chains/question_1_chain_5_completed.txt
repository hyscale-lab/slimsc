Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

So numerator is x y z, denominator is x² y² z². So the entire product is (x y z) / (x² y² z²) = 1/(x y z). 

So left side is 1/(x y z).

Right side: 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute the exponent:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12

1/3 = 4/12

1/4 = 3/12

So sum is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 over 12, so 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12).

Putting it together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies that x y z = 2^(-13/12)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me denote that as equation (4):

x y z = 2^(-13/12)  ...(4)

So the product of x, y, z is 2^(-13/12). Cool.

Now, I need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Let me write that expression in terms of logarithms.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x^4) + log₂(y^3) + log₂(z^2) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z

So I need to find 4a + 3b + 2c, where a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z.

Alternatively, I can let a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z, and express the given equations in terms of a, b, c.

Let me try that substitution. Since log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2, which is a - (b + c) = 1/2. Similarly for the others.

So:

Equation 1: a - (b + c) = 1/2

Equation 2: b - (a + c) = 1/3

Equation 3: c - (a + b) = 1/4

So now we have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c.

Let me write them out:

1. a - b - c = 1/2  ...(A)

2. -a + b - c = 1/3 ...(B)

3. -a - b + c = 1/4 ...(C)

Hmm, this seems manageable. Let me write this system:

Equation A: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation B: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation C: -a - b + c = 1/4

So three equations, three variables. Let's solve for a, b, c.

Let me arrange the equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2

2. -a + b - c = 1/3

3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I can solve this system using elimination or substitution. Let me try adding equations to eliminate variables.

First, let's add equations A and B:

Equation A + Equation B:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = 1/2 + 1/3

Simplify left side:

a - a cancels. -b + b cancels. -c - c = -2c

Right side: 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6

So: -2c = 5/6 → c = -(5/6)/2 = -5/12

So c = -5/12

Wait, that's interesting. So log₂z = -5/12, which would mean z = 2^(-5/12). But let's proceed.

Now, knowing c, let's find a and b.

Let me plug c into equation A:

a - b - (-5/12) = 1/2 → a - b + 5/12 = 1/2 → a - b = 1/2 - 5/12

Convert 1/2 to 6/12: 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12

So equation D: a - b = 1/12

Similarly, plug c into equation B:

Equation B: -a + b - c = 1/3 → -a + b - (-5/12) = 1/3 → -a + b + 5/12 = 1/3

Convert 1/3 to 4/12: 4/12

So: -a + b = 4/12 - 5/12 = -1/12

So equation E: -a + b = -1/12

Now, we have two equations:

Equation D: a - b = 1/12

Equation E: -a + b = -1/12

Let me write them together:

a - b = 1/12

- a + b = -1/12

If I add these two equations:

(a - b) + (-a + b) = 1/12 - 1/12 → 0 = 0

Hmm, that's not helpful. It means the equations are dependent. So I can't get a unique solution from these two; I need another equation.

Wait, maybe I should use equation C to find another relationship.

Equation C: -a - b + c = 1/4

We know c = -5/12, so:

- a - b + (-5/12) = 1/4 → -a - b = 1/4 + 5/12

Convert 1/4 to 3/12: 3/12 + 5/12 = 8/12 = 2/3

So equation F: -a - b = 2/3

Now, let's use equation D and equation F to solve for a and b.

From equation D: a - b = 1/12

From equation F: -a - b = 2/3

Let me write these as:

Equation D: a - b = 1/12

Equation F: -a - b = 2/3

Let me add equations D and F:

(a - b) + (-a - b) = 1/12 + 2/3 → -2b = 1/12 + 8/12 = 9/12 = 3/4

So, -2b = 3/4 → b = -(3/4)/2 = -3/8

So b = -3/8

Now, plug back into equation D: a - (-3/8) = 1/12 → a + 3/8 = 1/12

So a = 1/12 - 3/8

Convert to 24 denominators:

1/12 = 2/24

3/8 = 9/24

So a = 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24

So a = -7/24

So now, we have a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12

Let me recap:

a = log₂x = -7/24 → x = 2^(-7/24)

b = log₂y = -3/8 → y = 2^(-3/8)

c = log₂z = -5/12 → z = 2^(-5/12)

So now, we have x, y, z expressed in terms of exponents of 2.

Now, the expression we need is |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²):

= log₂x⁴ + log₂y³ + log₂z²

= 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z

Substitute in the values:

= 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6

3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8

2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

So adding these:

(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Combine the terms:

First, the negative signs can be factored out.

= - [7/6 + 9/8 + 5/6]

Combine the fractions. Let's find a common denominator for 6 and 8, which is 24.

Convert each term:

7/6 = 28/24

9/8 = 27/24

5/6 = 20/24

So sum inside the brackets:

28/24 + 27/24 + 20/24 = (28 + 27 + 20)/24 = 75/24

Simplify 75/24: divide numerator and denominator by 3 → 25/8

So log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8

Thus, the absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8

So m = 25, n =8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m +n =25 +8= 33.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Calculating log₂(x⁴ y³ z²):

=4a +3b +2c

With a=-7/24, b=-3/8, c=-5/12

So 4a =4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6

3b=3*(-3/8)= -9/8

2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6

Adding them:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Combine terms for easier calculation:

(-7/6 -5/6) = (-12/6) = -2

Then -2 -9/8 = (-16/8 -9/8)= (-25/8)

So the total is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the answer is 25/8, so m +n=25 +8=33.


To solve the system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\), so \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\), so \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\), so \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side gives \(\frac{1}{xyz}\), and the right side combines exponents:

\[
2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Thus, \(\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12}\), so \(xyz = 2^{-13/12}\).

We then express the logarithms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). Substituting these into the original equations, we get a system of linear equations:

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

Solving this system, we find:

- Adding equations 1 and 2: \(-2c = \frac{5}{6}\) implies \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\).
- Substituting \(c\) into equations 1 and 2, we solve for \(a\) and \(b\):
  - \(a - b = \frac{1}{12}\)
  - \(-a + b = -\frac{1}{12}\)
  - Solving these, we find \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\) and \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\).

Finally, we compute \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \(\frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
