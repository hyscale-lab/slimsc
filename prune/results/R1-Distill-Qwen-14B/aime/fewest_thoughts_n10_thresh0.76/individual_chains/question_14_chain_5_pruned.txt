Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, the largest one possible, such that if you change any single digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, when I divide N by 1000, Q is the quotient and R is the remainder. Then, Q + R is what I need to find.

Let me break this down. First, I need to find N, which is a four-digit number. So N is between 1000 and 9999.

The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, if I take N and change its thousands digit to 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing the hundreds digit to 1, the tens digit, or the ones digit, each time resulting in a number divisible by 7.

So, N has four digits: let's denote them as A, B, C, D, so N = ABCD in digits. So, A is the thousands digit (1-9), B is hundreds (0-9), C is tens (0-9), D is ones (0-9).

Now, if I change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which must be divisible by 7. Changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. All four of these must be divisible by 7.

So, the strategy is to find the largest N = ABCD such that all four of these modified numbers are divisible by 7.

I need to find the maximum N, so I can start from 9999 and go downwards, checking each number to see if it satisfies the condition. But that's time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model each condition mathematically.

Let me represent N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change A to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.

Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D must be divisible by 7.

Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

I can compute each of these modulo 7.

But before that, let me note the values of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7.

Because 10^k mod 7 cycles every 6, perhaps. Let's compute:

10^0 mod 7 = 1

10^1 mod 7 = 3 (since 10 /7 is 1 with remainder 3)

10^2 mod 7: 10^2 = 100. 100 /7 is 14*7=98, so 100 mod7=2.

10^3 mod7: 10^3 =1000. 1000 /7: 7*142=994, so remainder 6. So 1000 mod7=6.

10^4 mod7: 6*10=60 mod7. 60/7=8*7=56, so 4. 10^4 mod7=4.

But since N is a four-digit number, we only need up to 10^3.

So, 1000 mod7=6, 100 mod7=2, 10 mod7=3, 1 mod7=1.

So, for the four conditions:

1. 1*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + D ≡ 0 mod7.

Which is 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

2. A*1000 + 1*100 + C*10 + D ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. A*1000 + B*100 + 1*10 + D ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. A*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + 1 ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡0 mod7.

So, all four of these must be congruent to 0 modulo7.

So, equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7. (Equation 1)

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (Equation 2)

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7. (Equation 3)

4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡0 mod7. (Equation4)

So, four equations with four variables: A, B, C, D.

Wait, but A, B, C, D are digits, so A is from 1-9, B, C, D from 0-9.

Hmm, but how to solve these equations? Maybe express some variables in terms of others.

Let me see if I can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let's consider Equations 1 and 2.

Equation1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0

Equation2:6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0

Subtract Equation1 from Equation2:

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡0 -0 mod7.

Simplify: 6A + 2 -6 -2B ≡0 mod7.

6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

Divide all terms by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, it's allowed
