Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, the list consists of positive integers. So all numbers are 1 or higher.

Second, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers we pick, their total should be 30.

Third, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently, and "unique" means no other number appears as many times as 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

Fourth, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So the median is some integer, say M, which is not in the list, but it's the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order.

Our goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items. So once we figure out the list, we can square each number and add them up.

Alright, let's start by considering the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it has to appear more times than any other number. Let's think about how many times 9 appears.

Let me denote the list as a sorted list: a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ, where a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ ... ≤ aₙ.

The mode is 9, so 9 appears more often than any other number. Let's say it appears k times. Then, every other number can appear at most k-1 times.

Also, since the median is not in the list, that tells me something about the length of the list. The median is the middle value, so if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers.

Wait, but the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, for an even-length list, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers, which has to be an integer not present in the list. So that average must be an integer, meaning the two middle numbers are either both equal to that median or perhaps they average to it without being equal.

Wait, but if the two middle numbers are the same, then that number would be the median, but the median isn't in the list. So that can't happen. Therefore, for the median to be an integer not in the list, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, so their average is an integer not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the list length is even, but the two middle numbers are different, and their average is an integer not in the list.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd length, the median is the middle number, which would have to be an integer not present in the list. But wait, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is part of the list. So that can't be—it's required that the median is not in the list. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements because only then the median can be the average of two middle numbers, which isn't necessarily in the list.

So the list has even length. Let's denote the number of elements as n, which is even. So n = 2m for some m.

Therefore, the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which is an integer, and this integer is not in the list.

So the first step is to figure out the possible lengths of the list. Let me think about possible n's.

The sum is 30, so the average is 30/n. Since all numbers are positive integers, n can't be more than 30, obviously. But considering that 9 is a mode, it's likely that n is somewhere between, say, 5 and 15. Let me think.

Wait, if 9 is the mode, it must appear more than any other number. So if 9 appears twice, others can appear once. If 9 appears three times, others can appear at most twice, but since it's the unique mode, others can't also appear three times.

So, let me consider how many times 9 can appear. Let's say t is the number of times 9 appears. Then, t must be at least 2, because if t was 1, then other numbers could also appear once, making the mode not unique. So t ≥ 2.

Also, other numbers can appear at most t-1 times.

So, let me try to find the possible values of t and n.

Also, since the median is not in the list, and the list is sorted, let's think about how the numbers are arranged. The median is the average of the m-th and (m+1)-th terms, which is an integer not present in the list.

So, let's denote that median as M = (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which is an integer.

Therefore, a_m and a_{m+1} must add up to 2M, and M is not in the list.

So, for example, if M is 8, then a_m and a_{m+1} could be 7 and 9, which add to 16, so M would be 8, which is not in the list. Or a_m and a_{m+1} could be 6 and 10, adding to 16, so M=8 again. Or other combinations.

But let's think: Since 9 is the mode, perhaps 9 appears multiple times near the end of the list.

Let me consider that the list is sorted, so the first few numbers could be smaller, then 9s, etc.

Wait, let me think about possible n.

Let me try n=6. Then the median is (a3 + a4)/2, which is an integer not in the list.

Sum of 6 numbers is 30, so average is 5. So numbers are positive integers, sum 30.

Also, 9 is the
