Okay, so I have this problem with two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That seems important because if four points lie on a circle, maybe I can use some circle theorems or properties. I need to find the length of CE.

Given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. Hmm. Let me try to visualize the problem.

First, let me sketch the rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has AB=107 and BC=16, so AB is the length, and BC is the width. So, ABCD is a rectangle where opposite sides are equal. That means AB=CD=107, and BC=AD=16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has FG=17 and EF=184. So EF is the length, and FG is the width. So EFGH is a rectangle with sides 184 and 17.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line in that order. So, if I imagine the line, D is connected to E, which is connected to C, which is connected to F.

Wait, but D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, and F is a corner of rectangle EFGH. Hmm.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic, or lie on the same circumference. That must mean that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

So, maybe I can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here. I remember that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. But I'm not sure how that directly helps yet.

Wait, but maybe I can also think about similar triangles or something related to the rectangles.

Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points can help. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (107, 0) because BC=16, which is the height. So, point B would be at (0,16), and point A at (0,16) but wait, no, AB is the length 107. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107 and BC is 16. So, if I imagine the rectangle, AB is the base, BC is the side. So, if I place D at (0,0), then C is at (107,0) because DC is equal to AB, which is 107. Then, since BC is 16, point B would be at (107,16), and point A at (0,16). Wait, no, because ABCD is a rectangle, so moving from A to B to C to D and
