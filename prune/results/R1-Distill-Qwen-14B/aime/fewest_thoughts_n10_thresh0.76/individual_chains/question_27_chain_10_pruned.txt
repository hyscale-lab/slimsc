Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the torus is pretty large compared to the circle.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere or outside of it, and in each case, they're tangent along a circle. The radii of these circles are r_i (inside) and r_o (outside), and I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to find the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere in both cases. Let me recall some geometry about tori and spheres.

First, the torus T is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius R of the torus is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So, R = 6, r = 3.

The sphere S has radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, they're tangent along a circle, and when it's outside, they're also tangent along another circle.

I think I need to find the radii of these tangent circles. Let me consider the two cases: internal tangency and external tangency.

Let me start with internal tangency. When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere except for the point of tangency. The point of tangency is along a circle, so that circle must lie on both the torus and the sphere.

Similarly, for external tangency, the torus is outside the sphere, touching it along a circle.

I think I need to find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus when they are tangent, and then use that to find the radius of the tangent circle.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so its center isn't a single point. Hmm, maybe I should model the torus mathematically.

The standard equation for a torus is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. In this case, R = 6, r = 3. So, the equation is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

The sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, their surfaces touch at a single circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they touch along another circle.

I think I can find the points where the torus and sphere are tangent by solving their equations together and ensuring that they have exactly one solution (i.e., the condition for tangency).

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the centers of these tangent circles.

Wait, another approach: when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at the origin, and the torus is centered at the origin as well, right? Because the torus is symmetric around the axis, which is the z-axis, I suppose, so the center of the torus is at the origin in some sense. Or perhaps the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is centered at the origin too.

Wait, I need to clarify: the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that
