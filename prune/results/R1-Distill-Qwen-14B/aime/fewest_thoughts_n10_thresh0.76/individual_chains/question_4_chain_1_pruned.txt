Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, regardless of how Alice plays. The game is between Alice and Bob, taking turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. The person who takes the last token wins.

Hmm, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the key here is to determine for which values of n Bob can force a win. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only guarantee a win if the starting position n is a losing position for Alice. That is, if n is a losing position, then Bob can win regardless of Alice's moves.

So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position. Let's try to model this.

Let me define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there's at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

Starting from n=0: Well, if there are zero tokens, the game is over. But since the last token taken wins, the player who cannot make a move loses. Wait, but n=0 would mean the previous player took the last token and won. So, n=0 is a losing position because you can't make a move. But in our case, the game starts with n≥1, so perhaps n=0 is a losing terminal state.

Wait, let's think again. For n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: Current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take the last one and win. Alternatively, the current player can take 4 tokens, but that's not possible since n=2 <4. So, the current player has only one move: take 1, leading to n=1. Since n=1 is a winning position for the opponent, n=2 must be a losing position
