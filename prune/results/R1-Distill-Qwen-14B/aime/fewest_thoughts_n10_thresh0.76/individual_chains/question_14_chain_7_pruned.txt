Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Alright, so N is a four-digit number, which is the largest such number with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. So, for example, if the number is ABCD, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, etc., and each of these should be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N. Once we have N, we divide it by 1000, getting Q as the quotient (which is the thousands digit) and R as the remainder (the last three digits). Then add Q and R together.

First, I need to figure out what N is. To do that, I should probably analyze the properties of N.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits, and A is not zero because it's a four-digit number.

So, the conditions are:

1. Changing the first digit (A) to 1: 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing the second digit (B) to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing the third digit (C) to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing the fourth digit (D) to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So all four of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such four-digit number, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find a number that satisfies all four conditions.

But checking each number one by one seems inefficient. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about modular arithmetic. Since each modified number is divisible by 7, their remainders when divided by 7 must be 0.

So, for each case:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But N is ABCD, which is the original number. Let me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then, each modified number can be expressed in terms of N and the digit being changed.

For example, when we change A to 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. But N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, 1BCD = N - 1000(A - 1).

Similarly, when we change B to 1, the new number is 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. So, A1CD = N - 100B + 100.

Similarly, changing C to 1: AB1D = N - 10C + 10.

Changing D to 1: ABC1 = N - D + 1.

So, for each modified number, we can write:

1. 1BCD = N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD = N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D = N - 10(C - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 = N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me write these congruences:

1. N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ N ≡ 1000(A - 1) mod 7
2. N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ N ≡ 100(B - 1) mod 7
3. N - 10(C - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ N ≡ 10(C - 1) mod 7
4. N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

So, all four congruences must hold. Therefore, N must be congruent to 1000(A - 1), 100(B - 1), 10(C - 1), and (D - 1) modulo 7.

But since all these are congruent to N mod 7, they must all be equal to each other mod 7.

So, 1000(A - 1) ≡ 100(B - 1) ≡ 10(C - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod 7.

This seems a bit complex, but perhaps we can compute each coefficient modulo 7 to simplify.

First, compute 1000 mod 7. Let's see:

7 * 142 = 994, 1000 - 994 = 6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, 100-98=2 ⇒ 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, putting it all together:

1. 1000(A - 1) mod 7 = [6*(A - 1)] mod 7
2. 100(B - 1) mod 7 = [2*(B - 1)] mod 7
3. 10(C - 1) mod 7 = [3*(C - 1)] mod 7
4. (D - 1) mod 7 = [1*(D - 1)] mod 7

So, all four expressions above must be congruent mod 7.

Therefore, 6(A - 1) ≡ 2(B - 1) ≡ 3(C - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod 7.

Let me denote this common value as k mod 7. So:

6(A - 1) ≡ k mod 7  
2(B - 1) ≡ k mod 7  
3(C - 1) ≡ k mod 7  
(D - 1) ≡ k mod 7

So each of these expressions is equal to k modulo 7, which we can use to relate the digits.

But since N is the largest four-digit number, we want N to be as large as possible. So, ideally, we want A to be 9, then B to be 9, etc. But the constraints may limit that.

Wait, but N is 9999? Let's see if that works. But probably not, because changing any digit to 1 would require that number to be divisible by 7. So 1999, 9199, 9919, 9991 would all have to be divisible by 7.

Wait, let me check 1999 divided by 7: 1999 ÷ 7 is approximately 285.571. Let me compute 7*285=1995, 1995+7=2002. So 1999 is 2002 -3, so 1999 ≡ -3 mod 7, which is 4 mod 7. So 1999 is not divisible by 7. So N cannot be 9999.

Therefore, we need to find N less than 9999 that satisfies the conditions.

Given that, perhaps we can model the four congruences.

Let me note that N is ≡ k mod 7, but also, from the four conditions:

N ≡ 6(A - 1) mod 7  
N ≡ 2(B - 1) mod 7  
N ≡ 3(C - 1) mod 7  
N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

But since all of these are equal to N mod 7, they must all equal each other.

So, 6(A - 1) ≡ 2(B - 1) mod 7  
6(A - 1) ≡ 3(C - 1) mod 7  
6(A - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

Similarly, 2(B - 1) ≡ 3(C - 1) mod 7  
2(B - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod 7  
3(C - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

But perhaps it's better to express all variables in terms of A.

Let me attempt that. Let's solve for k in terms of A.

From 6(A - 1) ≡ k mod 7.

So, k ≡ 6(A - 1) mod 7.

Similarly, from 2(B - 1) ≡ k mod 7:

2(B - 1) ≡ 6(A - 1) mod 7  
=> Multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, (B - 1) ≡ 4*6*(A -1) mod7  
=> (B - 1) ≡ 24*(A -1) mod7  
24 mod7: 7*3=21, 24-21=3 ⇒ 24≡3 mod7  
So, (B -1) ≡3*(A -1) mod7  
Thus, B ≡3*(A -1) +1 mod7

Similarly, from 3(C -1) ≡k mod7  
3(C -1) ≡6(A -1) mod7  
Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7. Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, inverse is 5.

So, (C -1) ≡5*6*(A -1) mod7  
=> 5*6=30≡2 mod7  
So, (C -1) ≡2*(A -1) mod7  
Thus, C ≡2*(A -1)+1 mod7

From the last congruence: (D -1) ≡k mod7  
=> (D -1) ≡6(A -1) mod7  
Thus, D ≡6(A -1)+1 mod7
