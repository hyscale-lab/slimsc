Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the grid left to right is 999. The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the grid top to bottom is 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, which means there are 2 rows and 3 columns. So, the first row has three cells, and the second row has three cells. When reading left to right, the first row becomes a three-digit number, and the second row becomes another three-digit number. Adding these two numbers should give me 999. 

Similarly, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is the two digits from the first cell of each row, the second column is the two digits from the second cell of each row, and the third column is the two digits from the third cell of each row. Adding these three two-digit numbers should give me 99.

Hmm, okay. Let me denote the grid with variables to make it easier. Let me label the grid cells as follows:

First row: A B C

Second row: D E F

So, the two numbers formed by reading left to right are ABC and DEF. Their sum is ABC + DEF = 999. 

The three numbers formed by reading top to bottom are AD, BE, and CF. Their sum is AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, but each of these is a number. So ABC is a three-digit number. Similarly, DEF is a three-digit number. AD is a two-digit number, as is BE and CF.

Let me express each of these as numerical values. 

So, ABC is 100*A + 10*B + C.

Similarly, DEF is 100*D + 10*E + F.

The sum ABC + DEF = 999.

So, (100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999.

Similarly, AD is 10*A + D.

BE is 10*B + E.

CF is 10*C + F.

And the sum of these is (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

So, I have two equations:

1) 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

2) 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

I need to find the number of possible digit assignments (A,B,C,D,E,F) that satisfy these two equations, where each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit from 0 to 9. 

Wait, but A and D might be zero? Because in ABC, A is the hundreds digit, so A can be zero, making ABC a two-digit number. Similarly, D is the hundreds digit of DEF, so D can be zero as well. But in the top to bottom numbers, AD is a two-digit number where A is the tens digit, so if A is zero, AD would be a one-digit number. Hmm, but the problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99." So, I think each of AD, BE, CF must be a valid two-digit number, meaning that A, B, C cannot be zero. Wait, no. Because, for example, AD could be 05 if A is zero, but that's a two-digit number. So, actually, A, B, C can be zero. Because, for example, if A is zero, then AD is just a two-digit number starting with zero, but digits can indeed be zero. So, A, B, C, D, E, F can all be from 0 to 9. 

Wait, but in the example given, in the first row, the digits are 0, 0, 8. So A is zero, making ABC a two-digit number 008, which is 8. Similarly, DEF is 991. 8 + 991 = 999, which works. So, yes, A can be zero. So, all the digits can be zero. So, I don't have to worry about making sure A, B, C are non-zero.

So, moving on. Let me write down the two equations again.

Equation 1: 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99.

Hmm. Let me see if I can manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Let me subtract Equation 2 multiplied by 10 from Equation 1. Wait, let's see.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the equations. Equation 1 is the sum of two three-digit numbers, and Equation 2 is the sum of three two-digit numbers. Maybe if I subtract or combine them, I can find some relations.

Wait, Equation 1: 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99.

Let me subtract 10 times Equation 2 from Equation 1. Let's compute that.

Equation 1: 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

10*Equation 2: 100A + 10D + 100B + 10E + 100C + 10F = 990.

Subtracting 10*Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F) - (100A + 10D + 100B + 10E + 100C + 10F) = 999 - 990.

Let me compute each term:

100A - 100A = 0.

10B - 100B = -90B.

C - 100C = -99C.

100D - 10D = 90D.

10E - 10E = 0.

F - 10F = -9F.

So, overall:

(-90B) + (-99C) + (90D) + (-9F) = 9.

Let me factor out the common terms.

-90B -99C +90D -9F =9.

I can factor out  -9 from the first three terms? Wait, not exactly. Let me see:

-90B = -9*10B,

-99C = -9*11C,

90D = 9*10D,

-9F = -9F.

So, factoring out -9:

-9*(10B + 11C) + 9*10D -9F = 9.

Wait, maybe it's better to factor out 9:

9*(-10B -11C +10D -F) =9.

Divide both sides by 9:

-10B -11C + 10D - F =1.

Hmm, that's a new equation: 

Equation 3: -10B -11C + 10D - F =1.

Now, let me see if I can find another equation. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can express Equation 1 and Equation 2 in terms of variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others. Let me think.

Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99.

Let me rearrange it as:

(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

But each of those terms is a two-digit number. So, each term is between 0 and 99. But since A, B, C can be zero, the two-digit numbers can be as low as 0 (if A is zero, D can be zero as well, but AD would be 00, which is zero, but 10A + D would be 0 + 0 = 0 in that case). Wait, but in the example given, A is zero, D is 9, so 10A + D is 9. So, perhaps the two-digit numbers can be from 00 (which is zero) up to 99. 

But in any case, the sum of the three two-digit numbers is 99. So, each term is a two-digit number, summing to 99.

Hmm. Maybe I can approach this by considering the three two-digit numbers, AD, BE, CF, which sum to 99. So, their sum is 99. Since each is a two-digit number, which can be from 0 to 99, but in reality, each two-digit number is between 00 and 99, which is 0 to 99, but for AD, since A is the tens place, and D is the units. So, AD can be as low as 0 (if A and D are zero) and as high as 99 (if A is 9 and D is 9).

But the sum of three numbers each between 0 and 99 is 99. So, the average per two-digit number is 33. So, each is around 33, but they can be higher or lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the three two-digit numbers as x, y, z where x + y + z =99, and x=10A+D, y=10B+E, z=10C+F.

Similarly, in Equation 1, the sum of ABC and DEF is 999.

But ABC is 100A + 10B + C, and DEF is 100D + 10E + F.

So, ABC + DEF = 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F =999.

Which can be written as 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) =999.

Wait, that's an interesting way to write it. So, 100*(A+D) +10*(B+E) + (C + F) =999.

So, if I can express (A + D), (B + E), and (C + F), maybe I can relate it to the sum of the two-digit numbers.

Wait, from Equation 2, the sum of the two-digit numbers is 10A + D + 10B + E +10C + F =99.

Which can be written as 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) =99.

So, 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) =99.

Let me denote S1 = A + B + C,

and S2 = D + E + F.

So, Equation 2 becomes 10*S1 + S2 =99.

Equation 1 is 100*(A + D) +10*(B + E) + (C + F) =999.

Let me denote:

A + D = a,

B + E = b,

C + F = c.

So, Equation 1 becomes 100a +10b +c =999.

So, 100a +10b +c =999.

Which is a three-digit number where a is the hundreds digit, b the tens, and c the units. So, 999 is the number, so a=9, b=9, c=9. Thus, 100a +10b +c=999 implies that a=9, b=9, c=9.

So, a = A + D =9,

b= B + E=9,

c= C + F=9.

So, each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) sums to 9.

So, A + D =9,

B + E=9,

C + F=9.

That's a key insight. So, each of these pairs must sum to 9. So, for each column, the two digits in the column add up to 9. That's a significant constraint.

So, now, that simplifies things.

So, moving forward, A + D =9,

B + E=9,

C + F=9.

So, in each column, the two digits are complements to 9. So, for example, if A is 3, then D is 6, because 3+6=9.

Therefore, in each column, once a digit is chosen for the top cell, the bottom cell is determined as 9 minus the top digit.

So, for each column, there are 10 possible pairs (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), ..., (9,0). So, 10 possibilities per column. But wait, since the digits can be from 0 to 9, each column has 10 possible combinations where A + D =9, etc. So, for each column, 10 possibilities.

Since there are three columns, that would suggest 10^3 =1000 possibilities. But we also have the constraint from Equation 2, which is 10*S1 + S2 =99, where S1 = A + B + C, S2 = D + E + F.

Given that A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9,

So, S1 = A + B + C,

S2 = D + E + F = (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) = 27 - (A + B + C) =27 - S1.

So, S2 =27 - S1.

Plugging into Equation 2: 10*S1 + (27 - S1) =99.

Compute 10*S1 +27 -S1 =99.

So, 9*S1 +27 =99.

Subtract 27: 9*S1=72.

Divide by9: S1 =8.

So, S1=8, and S2=27 -8=19.

So, the sum of the first row digits is 8, and the sum of the second row digits is19.

So, now, we have:

A + D =9,

B + E=9,

C + F=9,

and

A + B + C=8,

D + E + F=19.

But since D=9 -A,

E=9 - B,

F=9 - C,

Then, D + E + F= (9 - A)+(9 - B)+(9 - C)=27 - (A + B + C)=27 -8=19, which checks out.

So, the main constraints are:

A + B + C=8,

and for each column, A+D=9, B+E=9, C+F=9.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, where A, B, C are digits between 0 and9, inclusive.

Wait, but each of A, B, C can be between 0 and9, but their sum is 8. So, any combination where A, B, C are non-negative integers adding up to8, with each digit at most9.

But since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each digit can be at most9, all solutions will automatically have A, B, C <=8, so no need to worry about exceeding 9.

So, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, where A, B, C are digits (0 to9). 

The number of non-negative integer solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)= C(10,2)=45.

So, 45 solutions.

But wait, each solution (A,B,C) corresponds to a unique grid, because D=9 -A, E=9 -B, F=9 -C.

So, each (A,B,C) gives a unique grid. So, 45 possible grids.

Wait, but hold on. Are all these solutions valid? Because A, B, C must be digits (0-9), which they are, as 8 is the largest sum, and the individual digits can't exceed 8, which is <=9.

So, yes, each solution is valid.

Therefore, the number of ways is45.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me verify. Because in the example given, A=0, B=0, C=8. So, that's a solution where A=0, B=0, C=8, sum is8. Then D=9, E=9, F=1. So, yes, it fits.

Another example: A=1, B=2, C=5. Sum is 8. Then D=8, E=7, F=4. So, the grid would be:

1 2 5

8 7 4

Then, ABC is125, DEF is 874. 125 +874=999. 

And the sums top to bottom: 18, 27, 54. 18+27+54=99. So that works.

So, each solution (A,B,C) gives exactly one grid.

Therefore, the number of such grids is45.

Wait, but let me think again: are there any constraints on D, E, F? Because D=9 -A, E=9 - B, F=9 -C.

Since A, B, C are digits (0-9), D, E, F are also digits (0-9). So, no problem. For example, if A=9, then D=0. But since A can be at most 8 (as A + B + C=8), the maximum A can be is8, so D can be 1, as 9 -8=1.

Wait, no: A can be 8, then D is 1.

Wait, A can be 0, D=9.

Wait, but if A=8, D=1, which is a valid digit.

So, all D, E, F are also digits.

Therefore, each (A,B,C) in the solutions to A+B+C=8 gives a valid grid.

Therefore, the number is45.

Wait, so is that the final answer?

Wait, but in the example given, the sum of the two-digit numbers is99. Let me verify that.

In the example, AD=09, BE=09, CF=81.

So, 09 +09 +81=99, which is correct.

Wait, but in the example, A=0, D=9, so AD is 09, which is 9. Similarly, B=0, E=9, so BE=09=9, and C=8, F=1, so CF=81=81. 9 +9 +81=99.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought of the two-digit numbers as x, y, z with x+y+z=99, but in reality, the sum of x, y, z is 99. So, x, y, z are two-digit numbers, each between 0 and99, summing to99.

In the example, x=9, y=9, z=81. So, 9+9+81=99.

But in my earlier equation, Equation 2, I had 10A + D + 10B + E +10C + F=99. Which, in the example, is 0 +9 +0 +9 + 0 +8=17? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. Wait, 10A + D is 10*0 +9=9.

10B + E is 10*0 +9=9.

10C + F is10*8 +1=81.

So, 9 +9 +81=99. So, the sum is99. So, correct.

But in the way I set up, Equation 2 is 10A + D +10B + E +10C + F=99.

Which is correct.

But when I considered S1 = A + B + C=8,

and S2= D + E + F=19,

and 10*S1 + S2=99, which is correct.

So, all the constraints are satisfied.

So, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, where each of A, B, C is between0 and9.

Which is C(8 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

So, the answer is45.

Wait, but wait, in the example, A=0, B=0, C=8 is a solution, so 0+0+8=8. So, that's valid.

Another example: A=1, B=1, C=6: sum is8. Then D=8, E=8, F=3.

So, grid is:

1 1 6

8 8 3

Check sum ABC + DEF=116 +883=999.

Sum of two-digit numbers:18,18,63. 18+18+63=99.

Yes, that works.

Wait, another case: A=2, B=3, C=3. Sum=8.

D=7, E=6, F=6.

Grid:

2 3 3

7 6 6

Check ABC=233, DEF=766. 233+766=999.

Sum of two-digit numbers:27,36,36. 27+36=63; 63+36=99.

So, correct.

Therefore, all these cases work.

Thus, the number of such grids is45.


To solve the problem, we need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

### Key Steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the grid be:
     ```
     A B C
     D E F
     ```
   - The two three-digit numbers are `ABC` and `DEF`, with `ABC + DEF = 999`.
   - The three two-digit numbers are `AD`, `BE`, and `CF`, with `AD + BE + CF = 99`.

2. **Express Numerical Values:**
   - `ABC = 100A + 10B + C`
   - `DEF = 100D + 10E + F`
   - `AD = 10A + D`, `BE = 10B + E`, `CF = 10C + F`

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From `ABC + DEF = 999`:
     \[
     100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999
     \]
   - From `AD + BE + CF = 99`:
     \[
     10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99
     \]

4. **Manipulate Equations:**
   - Subtracting 10 times the second equation from the first gives:
     \[
     -10B - 11C + 10D - F = 1
     \]
   - Simplify further to find that each column sums to 9:
     \[
     A + D = 9, \quad B + E = 9, \quad C + F = 9
     \]

5. **Sum Constraints:**
   - Let `S1 = A + B + C` and `S2 = D + E + F`. From the second equation:
     \[
     10S1 + S2 = 99
     \]
   - Since `S2 = 27 - S1`, substituting gives:
     \[
     10S1 + (27 - S1) = 99 \implies 9S1 = 72 \implies S1 = 8
     \]
   - Thus, `A + B + C = 8` and `D + E + F = 19`.

6. **Count Solutions:**
   - The number of non-negative integer solutions to `A + B + C = 8` is given by the stars and bars method:
     \[
     \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
     \]
   - Each solution corresponds to a valid grid, as `D = 9 - A`, `E = 9 - B`, and `F = 9 - C` ensure all digits are valid.

### Final Answer:
The number of valid grids is \(\boxed{45}\).
