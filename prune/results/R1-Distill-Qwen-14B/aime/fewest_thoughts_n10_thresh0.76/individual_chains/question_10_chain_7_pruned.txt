Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers, and then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers. The condition is that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step. Alice picks a set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob creates a list of all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of all elements in A.

So, first, I think I need to figure out how the number of sets B relates to the set A. For a given set A, each element in A can be the maximum of some set B. The sets B would then consist of all subsets of the positive integers where the maximum is a specific element from A.

Wait, but the positive integers are infinite. So, how can we have finite nonempty sets B? Oh, right, each B is a finite nonempty set, so for each maximum element m in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum m is equal to the number of subsets of the positive integers that include m and only elements less than m.

But wait, the positive integers less than m are finite. So for each m in A, the number of possible B's where m is the maximum is 2^{m-1}. Because each such B is a subset of {1, 2, ..., m-1} union {m}, and since it must include m, the subsets are all subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1} with m added. So the number is 2^{m-1}.

So, for each m in A, the number of B's with maximum m is 2^{m-1}. Therefore, the total number of such B's is the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1}.

But Bob's list has 2024 sets, so the total number is 2024. Therefore, the equation is:

Sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

So, now I need to find all possible sets A such that the sum of 2^{m-1} for each m in A equals 2024. Then
