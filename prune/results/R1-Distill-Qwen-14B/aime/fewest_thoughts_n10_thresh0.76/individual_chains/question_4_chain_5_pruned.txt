Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in such games, it's often useful to analyze the positions as winning or losing. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's define the positions. The key is to figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position for the player whose turn it is. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position for the first player, then Bob can win.

Let me start by examining small values of n and see if I can spot a pattern.

n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice. Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take the last one and win. Wait, no, Alice wants to win. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no. If n=2, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes the last token and wins. So Alice doesn't want that. Alternatively, Alice could take 4 tokens, but she can't because there are only 2. So she can only take 1. So Alice is forced to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which means it's a winning position for Bob. Therefore, n=2 is a Bob win. So for n=2, Bob can win.

Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaves 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Alice can't force a win, so Bob can. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which is a winning position for Bob.

Similarly, n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob.
