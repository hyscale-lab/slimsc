Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when you read the numbers left to right, the two numbers add up to 999. The second condition is that when you read the numbers top to bottom, the three numbers add up to 99. 

Let me start by visualizing the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid, so it looks like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 
a & b & c \\ \hline 
d & e & f \\ \hline 
\end{array}
\]

So, the digits a, b, c are in the first row, and d, e, f are in the second row. 

The first condition says that when we read left to right, the two numbers formed sum to 999. So the first number is the three-digit number abc, and the second number is def. So, mathematically, this condition can be written as:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

The second condition is that when we read top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. So the three numbers here are ad, be, and cf. So, adding them up:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

So now I have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, I think I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate some variables. Let me try that.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f) - (10a +d +10b +e +10c +f) = 999 - 99

Let's compute the left side:

100a -10a = 90a

10b -10b = 0

c -10c = -9c

100d -d =99d

10e -e =9e

f -f =0

So adding these together:

90a -9c +99d +9e = 900

I can factor out a 9:

9(10a -c +11d +e) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10a -c +11d +e = 100

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let's note that down as equation 3:

3. 10a - c +11d + e = 100

Now, I have equation 2 which is:

10a + d +10b + e +10c +f =99.

I need to find digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each 0-9) that satisfy both equation 2 and equation 3.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others. Maybe I can solve for one variable in equation 3 and substitute into equation 2.

Looking at equation 3: 10a -c +11d +e = 100

Let me try to solve for e:

e = 100 -10a +c -11d.

But e has to be a digit between 0 and 9, so 0 ≤ e ≤9.

So 0 ≤ 100 -10a +c -11d ≤9.

Which can be rewritten as:

100 -10a +c -11d ≥0 → 100 +c -10a -11d ≥0

and

100 -10a +c -11d ≤9 → 100 -10a +c -11d ≤9 → -10a +c -11d ≤ -91 → 10a -c +11d ≥91.

So from these inequalities:

1. 10a -c +11d ≥91 (from the upper bound)
2. 10a -c +11d ≤100 (from the lower bound)

Wait, but from equation 3, 10a -c +11d +e =100, and since e is at least 0, 10a -c +11d ≤100.

And since e is at most 9, 10a -c +11d ≥91.

So 91 ≤ 10a -c +11d ≤100.

That's a useful range for 10a -c +11d.

Now, since all variables a, c, d are digits (0-9), let's see what possible values 10a -c +11d can take.

Let me consider a, c, d as digits from 0-9, so:

10a can be from 0 to 90 (a=0 to 9)
11d can be from 0 to 99 (d=0 to 9)
-c can be from 0 to -9 (so -9 to 0)

So 10a +11d can be from (0+0) to (90+99)=189
But then subtract c, so 189 -0=189 down to 0 -9= -9.

Wait, but according to our earlier constraints, 10a -c +11d is between 91 and 100, inclusive. So the possible values are 91,92,...,100.

So 10a -c +11d ∈ {91,92,...,100}

Now, let's consider variable a. Since 10a is part of this sum, a can be from 0 to 9.

But 10a needs to be such that 10a ≥91 +c -11d. Wait, but perhaps it's better to approach this by considering possible values of d and a, and then see what c would be.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find possible (d, a) pairs such that 11d +10a is in a certain range.

Let me think. Since 10a -c +11d is between 91 and 100, and c is between 0 and 9, let's consider that 10a +11d -c is between 91 and 100. But since c can be up to 9, 10a +11d must be between 91 +0=91 and 100 +9=109.

So 91 ≤10a +11d ≤109.

Hmm, because if c is 0, then 10a +11d =91, and if c is 9, then 10a +11d=100, but wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no.

Wait, 10a -c +11d = total. So if total is between 91 and 100, then 10a +11d = total + c.

Since c is between 0 and9, 10a +11d can be from 91+0=91 to 100+9=109.

So 10a +11d is between 91 and 109.

Now, 10a +11d. Let's find all possible (a, d) pairs where 10a +11d is between 91 and 109.

So let me consider d from 0 to9, and for each d, see possible a's such that 10a is within 91-109 -11d.

Let me make a table for d from 0 to 9:

d=0: 10a must be between 91 and 109 → a must be between 9.1 and 10.9. But a is a digit, so a=10, which is impossible. So no solutions for d=0.

d=1: 11*1=11. So 10a must be between 91-11=80 and 109-11=98. So 80 ≤10a ≤98 → a is between 8 (80) and 9.8, so a=8 or 9.

So for d=1, a can be 8 or 9.

d=2: 11*2=22. So 10a must be between 91-22=69 and 109-22=87. So 69 ≤10a ≤87 → a=7 (70), 8 (80). Because 70 and 80 are within 69-87.

So a=7 or 8 for d=2.

d=3: 33. So 10a between 91-33=58 and 109-33=76. So a=6 (60), 7 (70). 

d=4: 44. So 10a between 91-44=47 and 109-44=65 → a=5 (50), 6 (60).

d=5:55. 10a between 91-55=36 and 109-55=54 →a=4 (40),5 (50).

d=6:66. 10a between 91-66=25 and 109-66=43 →a=3 (30),4 (40).

d=7:77. 10a between 91-77=14 and 109-77=32 →a=2 (20),3 (30).

d=8:88. 10a between 91-88=3 and 109-88=21 →a=0 (0),1 (10),2 (20). Wait, 10a must be ≥3, so a must be ≥1, since a=0 gives 0 which is less than 3.

So for d=8, a can be 1,2,3 (since 30 is 30 which is ≤21? Wait, 10a ≤21 → a ≤2.1, so a=1 or 2.

Wait, 10a must be between 3 and 21.

So a=1:10a=10, which is between 3 and 21 → yes.

a=2:20, which is also between 3 and21.

a=3:30, which is above 21, so no.

So a=1 or 2 for d=8.

d=9:99. 10a between 91-99= -8 and 109-99=10. So 10a must be ≥-8 and ≤10.

But a is a digit, so 10a can be 0,10.

So a=0 (0) or a=1 (10).

So for d=9, a can be 0 or 1.

Wait, let me summarize all possible (a,d) pairs:

d=1: a=8,9

d=2: a=7,8

d=3: a=6,7

d=4: a=5,6

d=5: a=4,5

d=6: a=3,4

d=7: a=2,3

d=8: a=1,2

d=9: a=0,1

d=0: no solutions

Now, for each (a,d) pair, we can find the possible c values.

From equation 3: 10a -c +11d + e =100 → e = 100 -10a +c -11d.

But e must be between 0 and9, inclusive.

So for each (a,d), let's compute 100 -10a -11d, and then e = (100 -10a -11d) + c.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. Since e =100 -10a +c -11d.

So e = (100 -10a -11d) + c.

But e must be between 0 and9, so:

0 ≤ (100 -10a -11d) + c ≤9.

Which implies:

- (100 -10a -11d) ≤ c ≤ 9 - (100 -10a -11d).

But c is a digit between 0 and9, so c must satisfy:

max(0, 10a +11d -91) ≤ c ≤ min(9, 10a +11d - (100 -9)).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute for each (a,d) pair, the possible c values that make e between 0 and9.

Let me take each (a,d) pair and compute the possible c.

Starting with d=1:

d=1, a=8:

Compute 100 -10a -11d =100 -80 -11=9.

So e =9 +c.

But e must ≤9, so 9 +c ≤9 → c=0.

But let's check:

e
