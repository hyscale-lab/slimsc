Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So, f(x) is the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2, and g(x) is similar but with 1/4. These functions are probably creating some V-shaped graphs or maybe multiple segments because of the absolute values.

I think I should graph f(x) and g(x) first to understand their shapes. Let me consider f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner |x| makes it symmetric about the y-axis. Then subtracting 1/2 and taking absolute value again would create a V shape with the vertex at x=0.5 and x=-0.5. Wait, no, actually, the function inside the outer absolute is |x| - 1/2. So, the expression inside the outer absolute would be negative when |x| < 1/2 and positive otherwise. So, f(x) would be:

- When |x| >= 1/2: |x| - 1/2
- When |x| < 1/2: 1/2 - |x|

So, f(x) is a V-shape that has its minimum at |x|=1/2 where f(x)=0, and it increases linearly with slope 1 as you move away from those points. So, the graph of f(x) would have a V at x=0.5 and x=-0.5, forming a sort of diamond shape between x=-1 and x=1, maybe?

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let me do the same analysis. The inner |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So, when |x| >=1/4, it's |x| - 1/4, and when |x| <1/4, it's 1/4 - |x|. So, g(x) has vertices at |x|=1/4, creating a V shape there. So, it's a smaller V compared to f(x), centered at x=0 with the tips at x=1/4 and x=-1/4.

So now, f(x) and g(x) are both piecewise linear functions with their own V shapes.

Now, the functions y and x are defined in terms of compositions of f and g with sin and cos functions, respectively. Let me write down the functions again:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

Hmm, so to find their intersections, I need to find points (x, y) that satisfy both equations. That is, substituting y from the first equation into the second equation, or vice versa.

But given the complexity, perhaps it's better to analyze each function separately and then see how they interact.

Let me first analyze y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break this down:

1. Start with sin(2πx): This is a sine wave with period 1, since the period of sin(2πx) is (2π)/(2π) = 1. So, it's a wave that goes up and down once between x=0 and x=1, and repeats every integer x.

2. Then, compute f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 will be between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value, f(sin(2πx)) will be between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, no: Let me compute f(sin(2πx)):

Let me denote s = sin(2πx). Then, f(s) = | |s| - 1/2 |. So, since |s| is between 0 and 1, subtracting 1/2, so |s| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.

Case 1: |s| >= 1/2: Then f(s) = |s| - 1/2.

Case 2: |s| < 1/2: Then f(s) = 1/2 - |s|.

So, f(s) is a function that, for each s in [-1,1], outputs the distance from |s| to 1/2. So, when |s| is exactly 1/2, f(s) is 0. When |s| is 1, f(s) is 1/2. Similarly, when |s| is 0, f(s) is 1/2.

So, the graph of f(s) is a V shape with minima at |s|=1/2 and peaks at s=0 and s=±1.

Then, g(f(s)) is 4 times g of that.

Wait, no: Let's see, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). So, after f(s), which is between 0 and 1/2, we pass it to g.

Given that g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, so let's compute g(f(s)).

Let me denote t = f(s). So, t is in [0, 1/2]. Then, g(t) = | |t| - 1/4 |. But since t is non-negative, it's |t - 1/4|.

So, when t >= 1/4, g(t) = t - 1/4.

When t < 1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t.

So, g(t) is another V shape with a vertex at t=1/4.

So, since t ranges from 0 to 1/2, g(t) will range from 0 up to:

At t=0: g(0) = 1/4.

At t=1/4: g(1/4) = 0.

At t=1/2: g(1/2) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

So, the graph of g(t) is a V that starts at (0, 1/4), goes down to (1/4, 0), then up to (1/2, 1/4).

So, g(f(s)) will have a similar shape, but since t = f(s), which itself is a function of s = sin(2πx), the overall function y is going to be periodic.

Therefore, y = 4 * g(f(s)) = 4 * g(t)
