Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. We need to find Q + R, where Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number, and it's the largest such number with the given property. I need to figure out what N is, then divide it by 1000 to find Q and R, and finally add them together.

Let me break down the problem. First, N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is abcd (where a, b, c, d are digits), then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives ab1c. Each of these must be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest N such that this holds true. Then, compute Q + R where N = 1000*Q + R, so R is the last three digits of N, and Q is the first digit (since 1000*Q shifts it to the thousands place).

Wait, actually, when you divide N by 1000, Q is the quotient (which is the thousands digit) and R is the remainder, which is the last three digits. So for example, if N is 9876, then Q is 9 and R is 876. So Q + R is 9 + 876 = 885.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, we need to find N.

So, N is a four-digit number. Let me represent it as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, with a ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, changing a to 1 gives 1000 + 100b + 10c + d, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing b to 1 gives 1000a + 100 + 10c + d, and so on.

So, let's write down these conditions:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Additionally, N itself doesn't necessarily have to be divisible by 7, but all the numbers obtained by replacing one digit with 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, perhaps we can model these conditions as congruences modulo 7.

Let me recall that 1000 mod 7 is equal to (since 7*142=994, 1000-994=6). So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7 is 2 (since 14*7=98, 100-98=2), 10 mod 7 is 3, and 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's compute each of these modified numbers modulo 7.

1. Changing a to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So now, we have four congruence equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Our variables are digits a, b, c, d, each from 0 to 9, with a ≠ 0.

We need to find the largest N (i.e., the largest possible number, so we should start checking from 9999 downwards), so perhaps we can find constraints on a, b, c, d from these equations.

But since it's four-digit and we're looking for the maximum N, perhaps starting from 9999 and moving down, but that's a lot of numbers to check. Maybe we can find some relationships between these equations to reduce the variables.

Let me write down the four equations:

Equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod 7 → 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7 (since -6 ≡ 1 mod 7)

Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod 7 → 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7 (since -2 ≡5 mod7)

Equation3: 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod 7 → 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7)

Equation4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod7 → 6a +2b +3c≡6 mod7 (since -1≡6 mod7)

So, Equations:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7
2. 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7
3. 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7
4. 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7

Hmm. Let me see if I can relate these equations.

Let me subtract equation1 from equation2:

(6a +3c +d) - (2b +3c +d) =6a -2b ≡5 -1=4 mod7

So, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me note this as Equation5: 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, subtract equation3 from equation2:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) =3c -2b ≡5 -4=1 mod7

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation6.

Also, equation4 is 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation5: 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me try to solve for a or b.

Multiply equation5 by the modular inverse of 2 mod7. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, the inverse of 2 is 4.

So, multiply both sides by 4:

4*(6a -2b) ≡4*4 mod7 → (24a -8b) ≡16 mod7.

24 mod7 is 3 (since 7*3=21, 24-21=3), and 8 mod7 is 1. So 3a -1b ≡16 mod7.

16 mod7 is 2 (since 14 is 2*7, 16-14=2). So:

3a - b ≡2 mod7 → 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Let me write that as Equation7: 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

So, from equation7, we can express b in terms of a:

b ≡3a -2 mod7.

So, b is congruent to 3a -2 mod7.

Similarly, from equation6: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

We can substitute b from equation7 into equation6.

So, substitute b=3a -2 +7k (for some integer k). But since b is a digit (0-9), we can think of b as (3a -2) mod7, but let's see.

Wait, equation6: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Substitute b ≡3a -2 mod7 into equation6:

3c -2*(3a -2) ≡1 mod7.

Compute that:

3c -6a +4 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

3c -6a ≡-3 mod7 → 3c -6a ≡4 mod7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7).

We can factor 3:

3(c - 2a) ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, the inverse is 5.

So, multiply both sides by 5:

5*3(c - 2a) ≡5*4 mod7 → 15(c - 2a) ≡20 mod7.

15 mod7 is 1, 20 mod7 is 6 (since 14 is 2*7, 20-14=6).

So, (c - 2a) ≡6 mod7.

Thus, c ≡2a +6 mod7.

So, equation8: c ≡2a +6 mod7.

So, now, from equation7 and equation8, we have expressions for b and c in terms of a.

Now, let's proceed.

We also have equation4: 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

We can substitute b and c from equations7 and 8.

From equation7: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

From equation8: c ≡2a +6 mod7.

So, substitute into equation4:

6a + 2*(3a -2) + 3*(2a +6) ≡6 mod7.

Compute each term:

6a + (6a -4) + (6a +18) ≡6 mod7.

Combine like terms:

6a +6a -4 +6a +18 = (6a +6a +6a) + (-4 +18) = 18a +14.

Now, 18a mod7: 18 ÷7 is 2 with remainder 4, so 18a ≡4a mod7.

14 mod7 is 0.

So, 4a ≡6 mod7.

So, 4a ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod7. Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, the inverse is 2.

So, 2*(4a) ≡2*6 mod7 → 8a ≡12 mod7 → 1a ≡5 mod7 → a ≡5 mod7.

Since a is a digit from 1 to9 (since N is four-digit), possible values for a are 5 and 12, but 12 is not a digit. So a must be 5.

So, a=5.

Now, let's find b and c.

From equation7: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

a=5, so 3*5=15, 15-2=13. 13 mod7 is 6 (since 7*1=7, 13-7=6).

So, b≡6 mod7. So, b can be 6 or 13, but 13 is invalid. So b=6.

From equation8: c ≡2a +6 mod7.

a=5, so 2*5=10, 10+6=16. 16 mod7 is 2 (since 14 is 2*7, 16-14=2).

So, c≡2 mod7. So, c can be 2 or 9 (since 2+7=9, which is a digit). Wait, 2 is the smallest, then 9. So c can be 2 or 9.

So, possible c values: 2 or 9.

Now, let's go back to equation1:
