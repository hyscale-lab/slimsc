Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me try to understand the problem first.

Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop afterward. The problem gives me two scenarios with different walking speeds and the total time each takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk will take if she walks at a speed that's halfway between her original speed and the increased speed, and include the coffee shop time in this calculation.

Let me break down the information:

1. When Aya walks at a constant speed of 's' km/h, the total time taken is 4 hours. This includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop.
2. When she increases her speed to 's + 2' km/h, the total time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is still including 't' minutes in the coffee shop.
3. We need to find the total time when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, again including 't' minutes.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me note that the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. So, the walking time plus 't' minutes equals the total time given in each scenario.

Wait, but the problem says "including t minutes". So, the total time includes the coffee shop time. So, if I subtract the coffee shop time from the total time, I'll get the actual walking time.

Wait, but in both scenarios, the coffee shop time is the same, 't' minutes. So, the difference in total time must be due to the difference in walking time.

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote:

- Distance walked: D = 9 km (constant)
- Speed in first case: s km/h
- Speed in second case: s + 2 km/h
- Total time in first case: 4 hours = 240 minutes
- Total time in second case: 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes
- Coffee shop time in both cases: t minutes

So, the walking time in the first case is (240 - t) minutes, and in the second case, it's (144 - t) minutes.

Wait, but walking time is in hours
