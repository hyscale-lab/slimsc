Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The condition is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the greatest such number, so I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the condition.

The condition is that changing any one digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So for each digit in N (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones), replacing it with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. That seems pretty strict.

Let me think about how to approach this. For a four-digit number ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits), each of the four numbers: A1CD, B1CD, AB1D, ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

Wait, no, actually, when you change one digit to 1, it's not necessarily replacing the first digit with 1. It depends on the original digit. For example, if the original digit is 5, changing it to 1 would decrease it, but if it's 0, changing it to 1 would actually increase the number.

But regardless, the condition is that each of these modified numbers is divisible by 7. So for each digit, replacing it with 1 gives a number that is 0 mod 7.

So for each position, the modified number must be congruent to 0 mod 7. Let me represent N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is not zero because it's a four-digit number.

Then, the four modified numbers would be:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Divisible by 7.

4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Divisible by 7.

So, these four expressions must each be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let me write these as congruences:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, perhaps I can compute the modulo 7 of each term to simplify.

First, let's compute the coefficients of each digit modulo 7.

1000 mod 7: Let's calculate 1000 / 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 /7 is 14*7=98, so 100 -98=2. So 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite each condition using these mod7 equivalents.

Condition 1: (6) + (2)b + (3)c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

Condition 2: (6)a + (2) + (3)c + d ≡0 mod7.

Condition 3: (6)a + (2)b + (3) + d ≡ 0 mod7.

Condition 4: (6)a + (2)b + (3)c + 1 ≡0 mod7.

So, the four equations become:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7.

4. 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

That's four congruence equations involving a, b, c, d.

Now, I need to find a, b, c, d (digits, with a from 1-9, others 0-9) such that all four equations are satisfied. And N should be as large as possible, so we'd prefer a=9, then b=9, etc.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can subtract some equations to find relationships between a, b, c, d.

Let me label the equations for clarity.

Equation (1): 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

Equation (2): 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

Equation (3): 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7.

Equation (4): 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (6a + 2 +3c +d) - (6 + 2b +3c +d) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6a +2 -6 -2b ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

So, equation (2)-(1) gives: 3a - b ≡2 mod7. Let's call this equation (5).

Similarly, subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

(6a +2b +3 +d) - (6 +2b +3c +d) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6a +3 +d -6 -3c -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -3 -3c ≡0 mod7.

Factor: 6a -3(c +1) ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, that's equation (3)-(1): 6a -3(c +1) ≡0 mod7.

Let me write it as 6a ≡3(c +1) mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 3 mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7).

So, multiply both sides by 5: (6a)*5 ≡ (3(c +1))*5 mod7.

Which is 30a ≡15(c+1) mod7.

But 30 mod7 is 2 (since 7*4=28, 30-28=2), and 15 mod7 is 1.

So, 2a ≡ (c +1) mod7.

So, equation (3)-(1) gives 2a ≡ c +1 mod7. Let's call this equation (6).

Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (4):

(6a +2b +3c +1) - (6 +2b +3c +d) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6a +1 -6 -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -5 -d ≡0 mod7.

Which implies d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So equation (4)-(1) gives d ≡6a -5 mod7. Let's call this equation (7).

Now, let's see what we have so far.

Equation (5): 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Equation (6): 2a ≡c +1 mod7.

Equation (7): d ≡6a -5 mod7.

We can also perhaps subtract other equations.

Subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

(6a +2b +3 +d) - (6a +2 +3c +d) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 2b +3 +d -2 -3c -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 2b +1 -3c ≡0 mod7.

Which is 2b -3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, equation (3)-(2) gives 2b -3c ≡-1 mod7, which is same as 2b -3c ≡6 mod7. Let's call this equation (8).

Hmm, maybe now we can create a system of equations. Let's list what we have:

Equation (5): 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Equation (6): 2a ≡c +1 mod7.

Equation (7): d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Equation (8): 2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

So, four equations with variables a, b, c, d.

We can try to express b, c, d in terms of a.

From equation (5): b ≡3a -2 mod7.

From equation (6): c ≡2a -1 mod7.

From equation (8): 2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

Let me substitute b and c from equations (5) and (6) into equation (8).

So, b=3a -2 mod7, and c=2a -1 mod7.

Substitute into equation (8):

2*(3a -2) -3*(2a -1) ≡6 mod7.

Compute:

6a -4 -6a +3 ≡6 mod7.

Simplify:

(6a -6a) + (-4 +3) ≡6 mod7.

Which is 0a -1 ≡6 mod7.

So, -1 ≡6 mod7. Which is true because 6 ≡ -1 mod7.

So, that doesn't give any new information. It's an identity, meaning our substitutions are correct.

So, now, we can express b, c, d in terms of a.

So, b ≡3a -2 mod7.

c ≡2a -1 mod7.

d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Now, since a, b, c, d are digits (a from 1-9, others 0-9), let's find for each possible a (preferably starting from 9 downwards as we want the largest N), the possible b, c, d that satisfy the above conditions and are digits.

We can also note that a, b, c, d are digits, so 0 ≤ b, c, d ≤9, and 1 ≤a ≤9.

So, let's try a=9 first, since we want the largest N.

Compute for a=9:

b ≡3*9 -2 mod7.

3*9=27; 27-2=25.

25 mod7: 7*3=21, 25-21=4. So b≡4 mod7.

But b is a digit, so possible b=4 or 11, but 11 is invalid. So b=4.

Similarly, c≡2*9 -1=18-1=17 mod7: 17-14=3. So c≡3 mod7.

So c can be 3 or 10, but 10 is invalid. So c=3.

d≡6*9 -5=54-5=49 mod7. 49 is 0 mod7. So d≡0 mod7.

d is a digit, so d=0 or 7. But since we want the largest N, we should choose d=7.

So, for a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7.

So the number N would be 9437.

Now, let's check if this satisfies all four conditions.

When we change each digit to 1, check if the number is divisible by 7.

1. Change a to 1: 1437.

Compute 1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. Not divisible by 7. Wait, that's a problem.

Hmm, so N=9437 when changing the thousands digit to 1 gives 1437, which is not divisible by 7. So this number doesn't satisfy the condition. So, a=9 is invalid. So, perhaps, the next a.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, for a=9, equation (5): b ≡3*9 -2 mod7. 3*9=27, 27-2=25. 25 mod7 is 4, yes. So b=4.

Equation (6): c≡2*9 -1 mod7. 2*9=18-1=17, mod7 is 3, correct. c=3.

Equation (7): d≡6*9 -5=54-5=49. 49 mod7=0, so d=0 or 7. As d=7 is larger, we take d=7.

So N=9437.

But changing a=9 to 1 gives 1437. Let me compute 1437 ÷7.

7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. So remainder 2. So not divisible by 7. So condition fails.

So, this N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition. So a=9 is invalid.

So, we need to try a=8.

a=8.

Compute b≡3*8 -2=24-2=22 mod7. 22/7=3*7=21, 22-21=1. So b≡1 mod7.

So b can be 1 or 8. Since we want the largest possible number, we prefer larger digits, so b=8.

c≡2*8 -1=16-1=15 mod7. 15-14=1. So c≡1 mod7. So c=1 or 8. Again, prefer larger, so c=8.

d≡6*8 -5=48-5=43 mod7. 43-42=1. So d≡1 mod7. So d=1 or 8 (since 8 is less than 10). To maximize, d=8.

So, N=8888.

Wait, let's check if this N=8888 satisfies the conditions.

Changing any digit to 1:

1. Changing a=8 to 1: 1888.

Check if 1888 is divisible by 7.

Compute 7*269=1883. 1888-1883=5. Not divisible by 7.

So condition fails. So N=8888 is invalid.

Hmm, so a=8 is also invalid. Let's try a=7.

a=7.

Compute b≡3*7 -2=21-2=19 mod7. 19-14=5. So b≡5 mod7. So b=5 or 12, which is invalid. So b=5.

c≡2*7 -1=14-1=13 mod7. 13-14=-1≡6 mod7. So c≡6 mod7. So c=6 or 13, invalid. So c=6.

d≡6*7 -5=42-5=37 mod7. 37-35=2. So d≡2 mod7. So d=2 or 9. Prefer larger, so d=9.

So N=7569.

Wait, let's check if changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7.

1. Change a=7 to 1: 1569.

1569 ÷7: 7*224=1568. 1569-1568=1. Not divisible by7.

So condition fails. So a=7 is invalid.

Proceeding to a=6.

a=6.

b≡3*6 -2=18-2=16 mod7. 16-14=2. So b≡2 mod7. So b=2 or 9. Prefer larger, so b=9.

c≡2*6 -1=12-1=11 mod7. 11-7=4. So c≡4 mod7. So c=4 or 11, invalid. So c=4.

d≡6*6 -5=36-5=31 mod7. 31-28=3. So d≡3 mod7. So d=3 or 10, invalid. So d=3.

So N=6943.

Check the conditions.

Change a=6 to 1: 1943.

1943 ÷7: 7*277=1939. 1943-1939=4. Not divisible. Condition fails.

So a=6 is invalid.

Next, a=5.

a=5.

b≡3*5 -2=15-2=13 mod7. 13-7=6. So b≡6 mod7. So b=6 or 13, invalid. So b=6.

c≡2*5 -1=10-1=9 mod7. 9-7=2. So c≡2 mod7. So c=2 or 9. Prefer larger, c=9.

d≡6*5 -5=30-5=25 mod7. 25-21=4. So d≡4 mod7. So d=4 or 11, invalid. So d=4.

So N=5694.

Check the condition.

Change a=5 to 1: 1694.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. Oh, that's exactly divisible. So 1694 is divisible by7.

Now, check changing b=6 to 1: 5194.

5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Exactly divisible.

Changing c=9 to 1: 5614.

5614 ÷7: Let's compute 7*802=5614. So yes, divisible.

Changing d=4 to 1: 5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Exactly
