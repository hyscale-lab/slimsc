Okay, so I need to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, but I don't know if that's immediately relevant here.

The problem is about finding rectangles. So, rectangles are quadrilaterals with four right angles. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various shapes, including rectangles. I need to count all such possible rectangles.

I think the key here is to consider the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it's highly symmetrical, which should help in counting the rectangles without missing any or counting duplicates.

Let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with vertices equally spaced around a circle. So, each vertex is 30 degrees apart (since 360/12 = 30). The sides are adjacent vertices, and the diagonals connect non-adjacent vertices.

For a rectangle to be formed, we need four points (vertices) such that the sides are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and the angles between them are 90 degrees.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles. How do I ensure that the sides of the rectangle are at right angles?

Maybe I should think in terms of vectors. Each side or diagonal can be represented as a vector from one vertex to another. For two vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero. But since all the vectors lie on a circle, maybe there's a property I can use here.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to think about the properties of rectangles in a regular polygon. In a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, there are multiple sets of parallel sides and diagonals. For example, sides are obviously parallel to their opposite sides. Diagonals can also be parallel, depending on how many vertices they skip.

So, perhaps I can categorize the possible rectangles based on the lengths of their sides, which are determined by how many vertices apart the sides or diagonals are.

Let me consider the possible ways to form a rectangle. Each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel sides. Each pair must be parallel, and the two pairs must be perpendicular to each other.

In a regular polygon, two sets of parallel lines can form a rectangle if they are perpendicular. So, I need to find all pairs of such lines that are perpendicular.

Let me think about the vectors again. Each side can be represented as a vector in the complex plane. The angle between two vectors is determined by the number of vertices they skip. For example, a side skips 1 vertex, a diagonal skips 2, 3, etc.

Wait, each side is between two adjacent vertices, so the angle between adjacent vertices is 30 degrees. So, the angle between two vertices separated by k steps is 30k degrees.

So, the
