Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. They mention that the probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's understand the setup. A regular octagon has eight vertices, each colored red or blue, each color having a 50% chance. So each vertex is independently red or blue, so the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. Each coloring is equally likely.

Now, the key part is that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices move to positions where there were originally red vertices. So, if I imagine rotating the octagon, the blue points should align with red points, and all the red points should now be where the blue points were. Wait, actually, no—maybe it's the other way around. Let me clarify.

If we rotate the octagon, each vertex moves to a new position. The problem says that after the rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, the positions that were red before the rotation are now blue. So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Or, more precisely, the set of blue vertices must be equal to a rotated version of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but the octagon can be rotated by any multiple of 45 degrees, right? Since it's regular, so it can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which are 8 possible rotations. So, the group of rotations here is the cyclic group of order 8.

So, for a given coloring, we need that there exists some rotation such that when we apply that rotation to the octagon, every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices must be a rotated copy of the set of red vertices. Alternatively, the coloring of blue vertices is a rotation of the red vertices.
