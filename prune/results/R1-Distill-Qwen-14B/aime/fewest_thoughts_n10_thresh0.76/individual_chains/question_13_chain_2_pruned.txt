Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. Her walking speed affects how long the walk takes, and she also spends some time at the coffee shop, which is the same each time, denoted by t minutes. 

The problem gives me two different scenarios:

1. When she walks at a speed of s kilometers per hour, her total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop.
2. When she increases her speed to s + 2 kilometers per hour, the total time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes at the coffee shop.

I need to find out how long the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes at the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. 

First, I think I should figure out how long the actual walking time is, excluding the coffee shop time, for each scenario. Because the coffee shop time is t minutes in both cases, and it's included in the total time, the difference in total times must be due to the walking time.

Let me denote:
- In the first case, walking at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which is 4*60 = 240 minutes. Out of these 240 minutes, t minutes are spent at the coffee shop. So the walking time is (240 - t) minutes.

- In the second case, walking at speed s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to minutes: 2*60 + 24 = 120 + 24 = 144 minutes. Similarly, the walking time is (144 - t) minutes.

Since the distance walked is the same in both cases, 9 kilometers, the time taken to walk should be distance divided by speed. But wait, time is in minutes, while speed is in km/h. I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Let me convert the walking times into hours because the speed is in km/h. 

In the first case, walking time is (240 - t) minutes. To convert to hours, divide by 60. So, walking time is (240 - t)/60 hours.

Similarly, in the second case, walking time is (144 - t)/60 hours.

So now, I can set up equations based on the distance formula: distance = speed × time.

For the first scenario:
9 km = s km/h × [(240 - t)/60] hours.

For the second scenario:
9 km = (s + 2) km/h × [(144 - t)/60] hours.

Let me write these equations out:

1) 9 = s * [(240 - t)/60]
2) 9 = (s + 2) * [(144 - t)/60]

Now, I can simplify these equations.

Starting with equation 1:
Multiply both sides by 60:
9 * 60 = s * (240 - t)
540 = s*(240 - t)
Let me rewrite that as:
s*(240 - t) = 540    ...(Equation A)

Equation 2:
Multiply both sides by 60:
9 * 60 = (s + 2)*(144 - t)
540 = (s + 2)*(144 - t)
So,
(s + 2)*(144 - t) = 540    ...(Equation B)

Now, I have two equations:

Equation A: s*(240 - t) = 540
Equation B: (s + 2)*(144
