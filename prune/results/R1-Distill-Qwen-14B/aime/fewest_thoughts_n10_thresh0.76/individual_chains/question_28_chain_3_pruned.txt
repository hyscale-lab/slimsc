Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. That point is called the incenter, right? It's like the 3D version of the inradius in a triangle. So, the inradius in a tetrahedron is the distance from the incenter to each of the four faces. 

The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and the edges are given in a symmetric way: AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). Hmm, so each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems like a symmetrical tetrahedron. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron is called "isohedral" or maybe "edge-transitive," but I'm not sure about the exact term. Anyway, this symmetry might help in calculating the volume and other properties.

First, I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron because the formula for the inradius (r) involves the volume (V) and the surface area (A). The formula is r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Wait, actually, in 3D, it's the volume divided by the surface area times 3? Let me check: for a tetrahedron, the inradius r satisfies V = (1/3) * r * A, where A is the total surface area. So, rearranged, r = 3V / A. Yep, that's right.

So, my plan is to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A, then compute r = 3V / A.

But how do I compute the volume of this tetrahedron? I know one formula is using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which can compute the volume from the edge lengths. That might be the way to go here, especially since all the edge lengths are given.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

Wait, let me make sure. Yes, the Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D in 3D is a 5x5 determinant, but I might have the exact form wrong. Let me recall.

The determinant is:

CM = determinant of:
[ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, AB², AC², AD²],
  [1, AB², 0, BC², BD²],
  [1, AC², BC², 0, CD²],
  [1, AD², BD², CD², 0] ]

So, with AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD as edges. Then, the volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ).

Wait, but the determinant is 5x5, right? So, perhaps I need to compute it correctly.

Given that, let me list all the edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) => AB² = 41

AC = sqrt(80) => AC² = 80

AD = sqrt(89) => AD² = 89

BC = sqrt(89) => BC² = 89

BD = sqrt(41) => BD² = 41

CD = sqrt(41) => CD² = 41

Wait, no, CD is given as sqrt(41), so CD² is 41.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)

AC = BD = sqrt(80)

BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, the edges:

AB, CD: sqrt(41) => squared is 41

AC, BD: sqrt(80) => squared is 80

BC, AD: sqrt(89) => squared is 89

So, in the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix, the entries would be:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, AB², AC², AD²] = [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, AB², 0, BC², BD²] = [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, AC², BC², 0, CD²] = [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, AD², BD², CD², 0] = [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Hmm, so the matrix is symmetric, which is good.

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That sounds a bit tedious, but maybe there's a pattern or symmetry I can exploit.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to note that the tetrahedron is isohedral, so maybe all its faces are congruent? Wait, no, because the edges aren't all the same. Each pair of opposite edges are equal, but the faces might not be congruent. Let me think.

Wait, each face is a triangle. Let's see:

Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC: which are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80)

Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD: sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89)

Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD: sqrt(80), sqrt(41), sqrt(89)

Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD: sqrt(89), sqrt(41), sqrt(80)

So, each face
