Okay, so I have this problem here: find the greatest four-digit positive integer N such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the maximum such N, so I should probably start looking near 9999 and work my way down.

The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means if I take N and replace the thousands digit with 1, the number is divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing the hundreds, tens, or units digit with 1 should also result in a number divisible by 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, changing any digit to 1 gives four different numbers:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, for each of these four modified numbers, when divided by 7, the remainder should be 0.

I think a good approach might be to set up congruences for each of these modified numbers modulo 7. Then, I can solve these congruences to find constraints on A, B, C, D.

Let me write down the four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Expressed in terms of A, B, C, D, this would be:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

I can calculate each coefficient modulo 7 to simplify these expressions.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

- 1000 ÷ 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 → 1000 ≡ 6 mod7
- 100 ÷7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod7
- 10 ÷7: 3*7=21, but 10-7=3 → 10 ≡3 mod7
- 1 ≡1 mod7.

So, substituting these into each condition:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡ 0 mod7

So now, the four congruences are:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 (mod7)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 (mod7)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 (mod7)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡ 0 (mod7)

Hmm, that's four equations with four variables: A, B, C, D. But A, B, C, D are digits, so they are between 0 and 9, except A which is between 1 and 9.

I think I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables. Let me see.

First, let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2. Equation2 - Equation1:

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod7
6A + 2 -6 -2B ≡0 mod7
6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7

Simplify this: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract equation3 from equation2:

Equation2 - Equation3: (6A + 2 +3C + D) - (6A + 2B +3 + D) ≡0 -0 mod7
2 -2B +3C -3 ≡0 mod7
-2B +3C -1 ≡0 mod7
Which can be written as 3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, Equation4 - Equation1: (6A +2B +3C +1) - (6 +2B +3C + D) ≡0 -0 mod7
6A +2B +3C +1 -6 -2B -3C -D ≡0 mod7
6A -5 -D ≡0 mod7
So, 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Hmm, so now I have three new equations:

Equation5: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7
Equation6: 3C -2B ≡1 mod7
Equation7: 6A - D ≡5 mod7

I can also try subtracting other equations. Let me try Equation3 - Equation4:

Equation3 - Equation4: (6A +2B +3 + D) - (6A +2B +3C +1) ≡0 -0 mod7
3 + D -3C -1 ≡0 mod7
2 + D -3C ≡0 mod7
Which is D -3C ≡-2 mod7 → D -3C ≡5 mod7.

Alternatively, 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So, Equation8: 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Looking back, Equation7 is 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So, combining Equation7 and Equation8:

Equation7: 6A - D ≡5 mod7 → D ≡6A -5 mod7.

Equation8: 3C - D ≡2 mod7 → D ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, setting them equal:

6A -5 ≡3C -2 mod7 → 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, this is allowed):

2A - C ≡1 mod7.

So, Equation9: 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Also, from Equation5: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → Let's write this as 6A ≡2B +4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime):

3A ≡B + 2 mod7 → Equation10: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Similarly, Equation6:3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

But from Equation10: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Substitute into Equation6:

3C -2*(3A -2) ≡1 mod7 → 3C -6A +4 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify: 3C -6A ≡-3 mod7 → 3C -6A ≡4 mod7.

Factor 3: 3(C - 2A) ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, the inverse is 5.

So, (C -2A) ≡4*5 mod7 → 20 mod7 →20-14=6 → (C -2A) ≡6 mod7.

Thus, Equation11: C ≡2A +6 mod7.

But from Equation9: 2A - C ≡1 mod7 → 2A - C =1 +7k for some integer k.

But Equation11 says C =2A +6 mod7. Substitute into Equation9:

2A - (2A +6) ≡1 mod7 → -6 ≡1 mod7 → -6 -1 ≡0 mod7 → -7 ≡0 mod7 → which holds. So, these are consistent.

So, now, I can express C in terms of A: C ≡2A +6 mod7.

Similarly, B is expressed in terms of A: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

And D is expressed in terms of A: D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, now, all variables B, C, D can be expressed in terms of A modulo7. Since A is a digit from 1-9, but mod7, A can be from 1-6,7, etc. Wait, actually, let's think about how A relates mod7.

So, since N is a four-digit number, A can be 1 to 9. But in mod7, A can be 1,2,...,7, and then 8≡1,9≡2 mod7.

Wait, so when A is 8, A≡1 mod7, and when A=9, A≡2 mod7.

So, perhaps it's better to think of A in terms of its value mod7, but since A is a digit, it's 1-9, but mod7, it's 1-6,0 (but A can't be 0 since it's the first digit).

Wait, 7 is 0 mod7, but A can be 7, so A can be 0 mod7 when A=7.

So, A can be 1-9, which are 1,2,3,4,5,6,0,1,2 mod7 for A=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

So, A can be in 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 mod7.

But A=7 is 0 mod7.

So, perhaps I can consider A mod7 and then express B, C, D accordingly.

But the problem is that I need to find the maximum N, so I should probably start with A=9 and work my way down.

But since N is as large as possible, I need the largest possible A, which is 9, then 8, etc.

So, let me try A=9 first.

If A=9, then:

B ≡3A -2 mod7 → 3*9=27 →27 mod7: 7*3=21 →27-21=6 →6-2=4 → B≡4 mod7.

So, B can be 4 or 11, but B is a digit, so B=4 or 11 invalid, so B=4.

Similarly, C ≡2A +6 mod7 → 2*9=18 +6=24 →24 mod7: 7*3=21 →24-21=3 →C≡3 mod7.

So, C can be 3 or 10, but 10 is invalid, so C=3.

D ≡6A -5 mod7 →6*9=54 -5=49 →49 mod7 is 0, so D≡0 mod7.

So, D can be 0 or 7, since D is a digit. So, D=0 or 7.

So, for A=9, B=4, C=3, D can be 0 or 7.

So, possible N=9430 or
