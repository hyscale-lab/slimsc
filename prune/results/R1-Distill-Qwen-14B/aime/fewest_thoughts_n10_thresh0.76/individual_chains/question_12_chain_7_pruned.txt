Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when I read the grid left to right on the top row and the bottom row, the sum of the two numbers formed is 999. The second condition is that when I read the grid top to bottom in each column, the sum of those three numbers is 99. 

Hmm, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so it has two rows and three columns. I'll denote the cells as follows:

Top row: A, B, C
Bottom row: D, E, F

So, the two numbers formed by reading left to right are ABC and DEF. Their sum should be 999. That means ABC + DEF = 999. 

Additionally, when I read top to bottom in each column, I get A followed by D (which forms AD), B followed by E (BE), and C followed by F (CF). The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Let me write down these two equations more formally.

First, ABC is a three-digit number. So, ABC = 100*A + 10*B + C. Similarly, DEF = 100*D + 10*E + F. Their sum is:

100*A + 10*B + C + 100*D + 10*E + F = 999.

Simplifying, that's:

100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

So, 100*(A+D) + 10*(B+E) + (C + F) = 999.

Let me call S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F. Then:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

So, this equation must hold. Now, the digits A, B, C, D, E, F are each between 0 and 9. So, their sums S1, S2, S3 can range between 0 and 18, but likely much less.

Wait, but 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999. So, 100*S1 is the hundreds place, 10*S2 is the tens, and S3 is the units.

So, 999 is 9*100 + 9*10 + 9. So, comparing, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 should equal 999. So, S1 must be 9, S2 must be 9, and S3 must be 9.

Wait, because 100*9 + 10*9 +9 = 999, right? So, that gives S1 = 9, S2 = 9, and S3 = 9.

So, that means:

A + D = 9,

B + E = 9,

C + F = 9.

So, now each of these pairs (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must sum to 9.

That's interesting. So, each pair of digits in the same column adds up to 9. Wait, no, because A and D are in the same column, right? Let me check. The grid is:

A B C

D E F

So, columns are (A,D), (B,E), (C,F). So, each of these columns' digits sum to 9. So, yes, S1 = A+D =9, S2 =B+E=9, S3=C+F=9.

So, each column sums to 9. So, in each column, the two digits must add to 9. That's a key insight.

So, the problem now reduces to finding the number of 2x3 grids where each column's two digits sum to 9. Because then, ABC + DEF would be 999, and the sum of the column-wise two-digit numbers AD + BE + CF would be 99, since each is a two-digit number where each digit is 9. Wait, no. Wait, each column's digits sum to 9, but AD is a two-digit number where A is the first digit and D is the second. But if A + D =9, that doesn't necessarily make AD a number like 99. Wait, AD is 10*A + D, right? Similarly for BE and CF.

So, the sum AD + BE + CF is (10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F). Since A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9, then each of these two-digit numbers is 10*A + D = 9*A + 9, because D=9 - A. Similarly, 10*B + E =9*B +9, and 10*C + F =9*C +9.

Wait, let me see: 10*A + D = 10*A + (9 - A) = 9*A +9.

Similarly, 10*B + E =9*B +9, and 10*C + F =9*C +9.

So, the sum AD + BE + CF = (9*A +9) + (9*B +9) + (9*C +9) =9*(A + B + C) + 27.

According to the problem, this sum must be 99. So:

9*(A + B + C) +27 =99.

Subtracting 27 from both sides:

9*(A + B + C) =72.

Divide both sides by 9:

A + B + C =8.

So, now I have two key equations:

1. A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9 (each column sums to 9).

2. A + B + C =8.

Our variables are A, B, C, D, E, F. Each is a digit (0-9), and they must satisfy these equations.

So, now the problem reduces to finding the number of possible digits A, B, C, D, E, F such that:

- A + D =9,

- B + E=9,

- C + F=9,

- A + B + C =8.

Each variable is a digit from 0 to9.

So, let's think about how to compute this.

Given that A + D =9, then D =9 - A.

Similarly, E=9 - B, and F=9 - C.

So, once A, B, C are chosen, D, E, F are determined.

But, we also have the condition that A + B + C=8.

So, the variables A, B, C must each be 0-9, and their sum must be exactly 8. Additionally, D=9 - A must be a digit, so 9 - A must be between 0 and9, inclusive.

But since A is a digit (0-9), D will automatically be a digit as well because if A is 0, D=9; if A is9, D=0. So, no problem.

So, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of possible triples (A,B,C) where each is 0-9, and A + B + C=8.

Each such triple (A,B,C) will determine D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C. Then, each of D, E, F will be digits as well,
