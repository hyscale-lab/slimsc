Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere, and I need to find the difference in radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere both internally and externally. Then, express that difference as a fraction m/n and find m + n. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I should visualize the setup. A torus is like a donut shape, created by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus has a major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) of 6 and a minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) of 3.

The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, they're internally tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, they're externally tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these two circles, r_i and r_o, and compute their difference.

I remember that the equations for a torus and a sphere can be written in 3D coordinates. Maybe setting them up and solving for their intersection points would help. Let me recall the standard equations.

The equation of a torus with major radius R and minor radius a is given by:
\[
\left( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R \right)^2 + z^2 = a^2
\]
In our case, R is 6 and a is 3, so plugging those in:
\[
\left( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 6 \right)^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
And the equation of the sphere with radius 11 centered at the origin is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121
\]

Since both the torus and the sphere are symmetric around the z-axis, their intersection (the tangent circle) lies in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis. Let's say the intersection is in the plane z = k for some k. Wait, but actually, in the case of internal and external tangency, the tangent point is a circle, so the plane containing this circle will be some distance from the origin. Hmm, maybe it's better to consider the cross-section in the x-z plane for simplicity.

Let me consider the cross-sectional view in the x-z plane by setting y = 0. Then the torus equation becomes:
\[
\left( |x| - 6 \right)^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
And the sphere's equation becomes:
\[
x^2 + z^2 = 121
\]
So, in this cross-section, the torus is a circle of radius 3 centered at (6, 0) in the x-z plane, and the sphere is a circle of radius 11 centered at (0, 0). 

Wait a second, that makes sense. So the cross-sectional view simplifies the problem to two circles in 2D: one with radius 3 at (6,0), and another with radius 11 at (0,0). The points where they are tangent will lie along the line connecting their centers, which is the x-axis in this cross-section.

But the problem states that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, they're tangent along a circle. So, in cross-section, that would correspond to the point where the smaller circle (torus) is inside the larger sphere circle, and they touch at one point. Similarly, when it's on the outside, the torus is outside the sphere, touching at another point.

Wait, but in reality, a torus is a surface, so when it's inside the sphere, the sphere must enclose the torus except for a small part. But perhaps the point of tangency is where the
