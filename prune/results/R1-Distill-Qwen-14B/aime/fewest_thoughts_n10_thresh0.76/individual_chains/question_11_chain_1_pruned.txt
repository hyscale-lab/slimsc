Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, alright, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number \( z \), if its magnitude is given as \( |z| = 4 \), then \( z \) can be expressed in polar form. That is, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, \( z \) can also be written as \( 4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \). This might come in handy later.

Now, looking at the expression, there are two parts: the first term is \( (75 + 117i)z \) and the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). I need to find the real part of the sum of these two terms and then determine its maximum value.

Let me denote \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) as mentioned. Then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because \( |z| = 4 \) implies \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \), but since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \), so \( 1/z = (4e^{-i\theta})/16 = (1/4)e^{-i\theta} \). Got that.

So substituting \( z \) and \( 1/z \) into the expression:

First term: \( (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \)
Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \)

Let me compute each term separately.

Starting with the first term:

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Similarly, the second term:

\( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \)

So the entire expression becomes:

\( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \)

Hmm, maybe it's easier if I express both terms in terms of sine and cosine. Let me also factor out the constants:

First term: \( 4 \times (75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i \). So the first term is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i \). So the second term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression is:

\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

Now, let me expand each exponential term using Euler's formula. Remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Expanding the first term:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
(since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Similarly, expanding the second term:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
(since \( i^2 = -1 \), so \( -i^2 = 1 \))

Now, let's collect like terms for both expansions.

First term after expansion:

Real parts: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \)

Second term after expansion:

Real parts: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \)

Adding both terms together:

Total real parts: \( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) \)
= \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)
= \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Total imaginary parts: \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) \)
= \( (300 - 24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta \)
= \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)

So the entire expression is:

\( [324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta] + i[276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta] \)

But since we only care about the real part, we can focus on the real part, which is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part as \( \theta \) varies over all real numbers.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

I remember that expressions of the form \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(B/A) \) or something like that. Wait, actually, depending on the signs, it might be \( R\cos(\theta - \phi) \) or something else, but the idea is that the maximum value is \( R \).

Wait, yes, more precisely, \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta = R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(B/A) \). So the maximum value is \( R \), since the maximum of cosine is 1.

But in our case, it's \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So that's like \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) with \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \).

So let's compute \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \).

Calculating:

\( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \)
= \( \sqrt{(324)^2 + (432)^2} \)

Let me compute \( 324^2 \) and \( 432^2 \).

First, 324 squared. 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400. So 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared. 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600.

So 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600, plus 1,024 is 186,624.

So R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

Wait, 291,600. Let me compute sqrt(291600). Hmm, 540 squared is 291,600 because 500^2 is 250,000, 40^2 is 1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So (500+40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So yes, sqrt(291,600) = 540.

So R is 540. Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the signs.

Because in our expression, it's \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So it's equivalent to \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) where \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \). So when we compute R, it's sqrt(A^2 + B^2), which is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2), which is the same as sqrt(324^2 + 432^2), which we found as 540. So yes, R is 540.

Therefore, the maximum of the real part is 540.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me make sure that the method is correct. So the general formula is that \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta = R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(B/A) \). So the maximum value is indeed R, occurring when \( \theta = \phi \).

Alternatively, when you think of \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) as a dot product between vectors, the maximum is the magnitude of the
