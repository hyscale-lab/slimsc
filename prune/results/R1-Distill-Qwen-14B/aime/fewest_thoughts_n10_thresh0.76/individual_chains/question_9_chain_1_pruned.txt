Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. It says that there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and also log base y of x^(4y) is equal to 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down what I know.

First, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help. The logarithm log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, I can bring the exponent x down. Wait, the power rule says that log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a). So applying that here, log_x(y^x) = x*log_x(y) = 10.

So, x*log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, I can also recall that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) is the same as 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to simplify. Let's say a = log_x(y). Then, the first equation becomes x*a = 10.

From the definition of a, a = log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as b. Then a = 1/b. So, substituting back into x*a =10, we have x*(1/b) =10.

But I also know that log_y(x) = b, which implies that y^b = x. Because if log_y(x) = b, then y^b = x. So x = y^b.

Wait, so x = y^b, and from earlier, x*a =10, where a=1/b. So substituting x and a into x*a:

x*a = y^b*(1/b) =10.

But since x = y^b, and a = 1/b, this gives y^b*(1/b) =10.

Hmm, maybe I can express b in terms of y.

Wait, maybe I should also look at the second equation to get another equation involving x and y.

The second equation is log_y(x^{4y})=10. Again, using the power rule: 4y*log_y(x) =10. And since log_y(x) is b, this becomes 4y*b =10.

So 4y*b =10. Let me write down the two equations I have now.

First equation: x*a =10, where a=1/b and x= y^b. So substituting, y^b*(1/b) =10.

Second equation: 4y*b =10.

So now I have two equations:

1. y^b*(1/b) =10
2. 4y*b=10

Maybe I can solve the second equation for y in terms of b, then substitute into the first equation.

From the second equation: 4y*b=10 => y = 10/(4b) = (5)/(2b).

So y=5/(2b). Now, substitute this into the first equation:

y^b*(1/b) =10.

So, (5/(2b))^b * (1/b) =10.

Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

Let me denote the left side as L. So,

L = (5/(2b))^b * (1/b) =10.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln(L) = ln(10).

So,

ln[(5/(2b))^b * (1/b)] = ln(10)

Using logarithm properties, ln(ab) = ln a + ln b, so:

ln[(5/(2b))^b] + ln(1/b) = ln(10)

Now, ln[(5/(2b))^b] = b*ln(5/(2b)), and ln(1/b) = -ln(b). So,

b * ln(5/(2b)) - ln(b) = ln(10)

Let me write this as:

b * [ln(5) - ln(2b)] - ln(b) = ln(10)

Because ln(5/(2b)) = ln5 - ln(2b).

Expanding that, it's:

b*ln5 - b*ln(2b) - ln(b) = ln(10)

Now, let's see. We can write ln(2b) as ln2 + ln b. So,

b*ln5 -b*(ln2 + ln b) - ln b = ln(10)

Which simplifies to:

b*ln5 - b*ln2 - b*ln b - ln b = ln(10)

Now, let's collect like terms.

Terms with ln5 and ln2 are linear in b:

= (b ln5 - b ln2) + (-b ln b - ln b)

Factor where possible:

= b (ln5 - ln2) - (b ln b + ln b)

Notice that ln5 - ln2 is ln(5/2), so:

= b ln(5/2) - ln b (b +1) = ln(10)

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I can consider substitution or see if there's a value of b that satisfies this equation.

Wait, perhaps if I assume that b
