Okay, so I have this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the infimum or the lower bound of BD squared. Hmm, I think I should approach this step by step.

First, let me recall that a rhombus has all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, they are perpendicular. So, that's an important property.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin. So, the center is at (0,0), and the origin is where the diagonals meet.

Given that ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that A is opposite to C, and B is opposite to D, with the diagonals AC and BD crossing at the origin.

Let me think about the coordinates of these points. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each pair of opposite points are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q). So, points are arranged as A, B, C, D going around the rhombus.

Now, all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, substituting each point into the hyperbola equation, we have for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, same for B, C, D.

Since A and C are opposites, their coordinates are negatives, so they satisfy the same hyperbola equation. Similarly for B and D.

Now, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Let me denote the lengths of the diagonals as |AC| and |BD|. The rhombus area can also be expressed in terms of the diagonals: Area = (|AC| * |BD|)/2. But I'm not sure if the area is needed here.

Wait, actually, the problem is asking for BD squared, specifically the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, I need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

So, perhaps I can parameterize points A, B, C, D on the
