Okay, I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1. So, for a 13th root, ω^13 = 1. That might come in handy later. Also, ω is a complex number, so it's on the unit circle in the complex plane. But I don't know if I need to work with the complex numbers directly here.

The expression given is a product over k from 0 to 12. So, that's 13 terms multiplied together. Each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it or simplify it somehow.

Let me look at the term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. I wonder if that can be written in a different form. Let me try to rearrange the terms: ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of ω^k. If I let x = ω^k, then the term becomes x^2 - 2x + 2.

So, each term is (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x is ω^k. So, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k.

Wait, but x is ω^k, which is a 13th root of unity. So, for each k, x is a root of x^13 = 1. So, each x satisfies x^13 = 1.

I'm trying to think if there's a way to relate the product over all roots. Maybe I can think in terms of polynomials. Since the product is over all 13th roots of unity, perhaps I can construct a polynomial whose roots are x = ω^k, and then evaluate the product as the value of that polynomial at certain points.

Wait, the product we're looking at is the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) for each x being a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, except x=1 because ω ≠ 1. Wait, but in our case, k goes from 0 to 12, so ω^0 is 1. So, when k=0, the term is (2 - 2*1 + 1^0) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So, the term when k=0 is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So, the product is the same as the product from k=
