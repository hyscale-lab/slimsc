Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. 

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait again. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, they are perpendicular bisectors of each other. That's an important point.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that tells me that the points are arranged symmetrically around the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C, which is opposite to A, should be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D should be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint of AC is the origin, and the midpoint of BD is the origin as well. So, that fits.

Now, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Since ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.

So, let's denote the coordinates of the points. Let me assign coordinates to A, B, C, D. Let me say that point A is (x, y), so point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B is (p, q), so point D is (-p, -q). 

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, so substituting each point into the equation:

For A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

For B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

Similarly for C and D, but since they're just negatives, they satisfy the same equation.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But another property is that the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the slopes of AC and BD should be negative reciprocals of each other.

Let me compute the slopes. The slope of AC is (
