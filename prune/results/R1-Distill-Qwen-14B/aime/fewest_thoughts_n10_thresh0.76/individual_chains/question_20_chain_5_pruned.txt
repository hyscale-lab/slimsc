Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the number of ways to place chips on a 5x5 grid. The conditions are a bit specific, so I need to parse them carefully.

First, there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips. Each cell can hold at most one chip. So, each cell is either empty, has a white chip, or a black chip, but since each cell can have at most one, it's either empty or one color.

The next condition is that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for columns. So, in any given row, if there's a chip, all chips in that row must be the same color. Similarly, for any column, all chips in that column must be the same color. Hmm, that's interesting. So, each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Same for each column.

Wait, but there's an additional condition: any additional chip placed would violate the previous two conditions. So, the arrangement is maximal; you can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column uniformity or exceeding the cell's capacity.

Let me try to understand this. So, if I have a grid where some rows are all white, some all black, others empty. Similarly, for columns. But since the grid is 5x5, each row and column can be in one of three states: white, black, or empty.

But wait, there's a catch. If a row is white, then every white chip in that row is accounted for, and no more can be placed. Similarly for black. But what about empty rows? If a row is empty, can I place some chips there? But wait, the placement must be such that all chips in a row are the same color, so if I add a chip to an empty row, I have to color the entire row either white or black.

But the condition says that the arrangement is maximal, meaning I can't add any more chips without violating the conditions. So, for each row and column, if it's possible to add a chip without violating the row or column condition, then it's not maximal. So, every row and column must already be in a state where adding a single chip would require that the entire row or column be of that color, which can't happen because the other cells in the row/column might already be different.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. For the arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell must be such that adding a chip there would require that the entire row or column be of that color, which contradicts the current setup.

Alternatively, perhaps every row and column must already be either all white, all black, or entirely empty. But wait, if a row is entirely empty, then I can just place a chip there, which would require that the entire row be of that color, but the condition says that the arrangement is maximal, so we can't add any more. But if the row is empty, we can add a chip, which would mean the row can't stay empty anymore. So, how does that fit?

Wait, maybe if a row is empty, it's because all the columns intersecting it are already monochromatic, so adding a chip in that row would require that the entire row be of the same color, but because the columns are already set, that's not
