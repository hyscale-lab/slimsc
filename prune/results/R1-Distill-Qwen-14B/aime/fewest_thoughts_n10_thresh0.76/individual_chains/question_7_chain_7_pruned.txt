Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for red or blue. The question is about finding the probability that there exists some rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention that this probability can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to understand what exactly is being asked here. So, we color each vertex red or blue randomly. Then, we can rotate the octagon, and we want all the blue vertices after rotation to be in positions that were originally red. So, essentially, we're trying to find the probability that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. So, rotations by multiples of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45) are symmetries of the octagon. So, for some rotation by k*45 degrees, the blue vertices after rotation should align with the original red vertices.

Alternatively, we can think of it as the set of blue vertices being a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the blue set must be a shifted version of the red set under some rotation.

But since each coloring is random, maybe I should think about the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability, so the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256.

We need to count the number of colorings where there exists some rotation (by 45, 90, etc.) such that when we apply that rotation, all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the original coloring has some red and blue vertices. Then, after a rotation, all blue vertices should end up where red vertices were. So, if we rotate the octagon, the blue vertices move to positions, and we want those positions to have been red in the original coloring.

So, in other words, the rotated blue set is a subset of the original red set.

Alternatively, the blue set is a translated (rotated) version of the red set.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a permutation. The rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices. So, the blue set after rotation is the image of the blue set under this permutation, which must be a subset of the red set.

Wait, actually, more precisely: the set of blue vertices after rotation must exactly coincide with the set of red vertices in the original coloring. Because all blue vertices must end up where red vertices were, and vice versa? Or is it just that blue vertices must be where red were, but red could go anywhere?

Wait, the problem says "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, it's only a condition on the blue vertices; the red vertices can go anywhere, right? Because the original red vertices could end up on blue or red, but the blue ones must end up on red. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Let me read the problem again.

"The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices."

So, after rotation, every blue vertex is now on a position that was red before rotation. It doesn't say anything about the red vertices, so they can end up anywhere. So, maybe the original red set must contain the image of the blue set under some rotation.

In other words, the blue set is a subset of a rotated red set. But since it's a regular octagon, the rotations are cyclic permutations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the blue set being a cyclic shift of the red set. Because when you rotate the octagon, you shift the colors around.

Wait, but each vertex is either red or blue. So, the original coloring is a subset S of the 8 vertices (the blue ones), and the red ones are the complement. Then, we're looking for a rotation that maps S to a subset of the red set. So, the image of S under rotation must be a subset of the red set, which is the complement of S.

Hmm, so in terms of set operations, we have that there exists a rotation r such that r(S) is a subset of S^c, which is the complement of S.

But S^c is just the red set. So, the image of S under some rotation must be entirely within the red set. So, the blue set S must be such that when rotated by some k positions, it lies entirely within the red set.

But since the octagon is regular, the rotations are cyclic shifts by
