Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. The point I is such that its distances to all four faces are equal. Hmm, I think this point is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The incenter is equidistant from all faces, and that distance is like the radius of the inscribed sphere or inradius.

Alright, the problem states the edge lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). So, all opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical, which might help simplify things. I remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron or sometimes a disphenoid. These have some nice properties, like the inradius can be found using a formula involving the volume and the surface area.

Wait, in a tetrahedron, the inradius (r) is equal to 3 times the volume (V) divided by the total surface area (A). So, r = 3V / A. So, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area.

First, let me try to compute the volume. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe I can use a formula for the volume of a disphenoid. I remember that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 72

Wait, is that right? Or maybe I'm confusing it with Heron's formula. Let me think again. Alternatively, another formula I saw somewhere is:

If a tetrahedron has opposite edges of lengths a, b, c, then the volume is (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2) )) / (6*sqrt(2)).

Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct either. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way. Maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the centroid is at the origin or something. Let me try that.

Let me place the points in 3D space. Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD, it might make sense to arrange the points such that they are symmetric with respect to the origin. Maybe like A = (x, y, z), B = (-x, -y, z), C = (-x, y, -z), D = (x, -y, -z). Let me check if this satisfies the opposite edges being equal.

So, compute AB: distance between A and B. A is (x,y,z), B is (-x,-y,z). The distance squared would be (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2 = 4x² + 4y². Similarly, CD is between C and D: C is (-x,y,-z), D is (x,-y,-z). Distance squared is (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (0)^2 = 4x² +4y². So AB = CD as given.

Similarly, AC is between A(x,y,z) and C(-x,y,-z). Distance squared is (2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2 = 4x² +4z². BD is between B(-x,-y,z) and D(x,-y,-z). Distance squared is (2x)^2 +0^2 + (2z)^2 = same as AC. So AC=BD. Good.

Similarly, BC is between B(-x,-y,z) and C(-x,y,-z). Distance squared is 0^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 =4y² +4z². AD is between A(x,y,z) and D(x,-y,-z). Distance squared is 0^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = same as BC. So all opposite edges are equal, as desired.

So, this coordinate system works. Now, the given edge lengths are AB=CD=sqrt(41), so AB's squared length is 4x² +4y² =41.

AC=BD=sqrt(80),
