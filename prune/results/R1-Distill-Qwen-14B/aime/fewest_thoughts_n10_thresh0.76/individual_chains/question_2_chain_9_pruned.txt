Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point A is on the x-axis, halfway between O and (1,0), and point B is on the y-axis, somewhere above sqrt(3)/2 which is approximately 0.866. So, they form a triangle OAB.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment starting on the x-axis, ending on the y-axis, and has length 1. So, for example, if P is at (a,0), then Q must be at (0,b) such that the distance between (a,0) and (0,b) is 1. So, sqrt(a² + b²) = 1. Therefore, a² + b² = 1.

The problem states that there is a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which are on the x and y axes, and the distance between them is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, the family F includes all such unit segments from the x-axis to the y-axis. Now, there's a point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, we need to find this point C, compute OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p+q.

Alright, so to find point C, I need to find a point on AB that isn't intersected by any other segment PQ in F. So, AB is one such segment, but any other PQ in F shouldn't pass through C.

Let me parameterize AB first. AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equations for AB can be written as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t
y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B. So, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, we need to find the point C such that no other segment PQ in F passes through it. So, for point C, the only segment in F that contains it is AB itself.

So, to find C, we can think about what the other segments PQ in F look like. Each PQ is a line from (a,0) to (0,b) where a² + b² = 1. So, the equation of the line PQ can be written as (x/a) + (y/b) = 1.

So, for any other segment PQ ≠ AB, the line PQ should not pass through point C. So, if we can find a point C on AB such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ in F, that's our point.

Alternatively, for all other lines PQ in F (other than AB), the point C is not on PQ. So, we need to find C such that for all other PQ in F, substituting the coordinates of C into the equation of PQ doesn't satisfy it.

So, let's suppose C is (x, y) on AB. So, x = 1/2 - (1/2)t, y = (sqrt(3)/2)t for some t. So, for any other PQ, which is from (a, 0) to (0, b), with a² + b² = 1, the equation is x/a + y/b = 1.

We need that for any a, b with a² + b² =1, except for a=1/2, b=sqrt(3)/2, the equation x/a + y/b ≠ 1.

Wait, but AB corresponds to a=1/2, b=sqrt(3)/2.
