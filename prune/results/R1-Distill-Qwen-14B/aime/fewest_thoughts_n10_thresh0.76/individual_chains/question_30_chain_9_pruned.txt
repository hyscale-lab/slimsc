Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a primitive 13th root, all the powers ω^k for k=0 to 12 are distinct and satisfy ω^13 = 1. Also, the sum of all ω^k from k=0 to 12 is zero. That might come in handy later.

The expression we're dealing with is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let's denote this product as P. So,

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I need to find P mod 1000. Hmm, maybe I can find the value of P first and then compute it modulo 1000.

Looking at each term in the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. That seems like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me check:

Let x = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². So, each term is x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, that factors as (x - 1)^2 + 1. Wait, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor x² - 2x + 2 as a product of linear terms. Let me try to factor it:

The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, each term can be written as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the product P becomes:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)) = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))]

Hmm, okay, so now I have two products. Each product is over all 13th roots of unity of (ω^k - a), where a is 1 + i and 1 - i respectively.

Wait, I remember that for a primitive nth root of unity ω, the product over k=0 to n-1 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x^n - 1. Because the minimal polynomial for ω is cyclotomic, and all roots are the nth roots.

But in our case, x is replaced by (1 + i) and (1 - i). So, the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - a) would be equal to (a^13 - 1). Because if we set x = a in the polynomial x^13 - 1, which factors as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k), so it's equal to a^13 - 1.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. The product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if I set x = a, then the product becomes (a)^13 - 1.
