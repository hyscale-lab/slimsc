Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize and understand the problem step by step.

First, the problem mentions two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. I know that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, and DA, and EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, and HE.

It says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm, so that means all four points lie on a straight line. Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Let's say rectangle ABCD is placed such that side BC is vertical, and AB is horizontal. Then, rectangle EFGH must be placed in such a way that points E and F are on the line connecting D, E, C, F.

Also, it's given that points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might come into play later, perhaps using properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

Given measurements: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find CE.

Let me jot down these lengths:

- AB = 107 (so in rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, BC is 16, making ABCD a rectangle with length 107 and width 16).
- BC = 16 (so the height of rectangle ABCD is 16).
- EF = 184 (so in rectangle EFGH, EF is one side, FG is 17, making EFGH a rectangle with length 184 and width 17).
- FG = 17 (so the height of EFGH is 17).

Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so for ABCD, AD = BC = 16, and AB = CD = 107. For EFGH, EH = FG =17, and EF = GH = 184.

Now, the rectangles are placed such that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine ABCD and EFGH, perhaps they are adjacent along a line, but with E and F somewhere on the line that also includes D and C.

Since A, D, H, G are concyclic, that must form a cyclic quadrilateral. So, maybe there's a circle that passes through all four points. That might help us find some relations between the sides or angles.

Let me try to assign coordinates to each point to make this more concrete.

Let's choose a coordinate system where point D is at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, which is vertical, let me orient it so that AB is horizontal. So, if D is (0,0), then C would be at (107,0), B at (107,16), and A at (0,16).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. If ABCD is a rectangle, then if AB is 107 and BC is 16, then moving from A to B is 107 units, and then from B to C is 16 units. So perhaps if D is at (0,0), then C is at (107,0), B is at (107,16), and A is at (0,16). Yes, that works.

So, in this coordinate system:

- D: (0,0)
- C: (107,0)
- B: (107,16)
- A: (0,16)

Now, rectangle EFGH is such that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line DC is
