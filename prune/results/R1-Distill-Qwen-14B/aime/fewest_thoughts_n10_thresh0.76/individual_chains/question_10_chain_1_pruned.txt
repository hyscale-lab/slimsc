Okay, so I have this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step. Alice picks a set A. Then Bob considers all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element in A, Bob can form sets where that element is the maximum. The total number of such sets is 2024.

I think I need to figure out how many such sets B exist for a given set A. Let me break it down. Suppose A is a set with elements a1, a2, ..., an where a1 < a2 < ... < an. Then for each ai in A, the number of sets B where ai is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, since each set B can include any combination of numbers less than ai, but must include ai itself to have it as the maximum.

Wait, that makes sense. For each ai, the number of possible sets B with maximum ai is 2^{ai-1}, because for each number less than ai, we have a choice of including it or not. But since B has to be non-empty, we don't have to worry about the empty set because ai is always included.

Wait, no, actually, B is a non-empty set, but when we fix the maximum as ai, the rest can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, including the empty subset. Because if we include ai alone, that's a valid set. So for each ai, the number of sets B with maximum ai is 2^{ai-1}.

So the total number of sets Bob lists is the sum over each ai in A of 2^{ai-1}. And this total is given as 2024.

So, if I let A be a set {a1, a2, ..., an}, then the total number of sets is sum_{i=1 to n} 2^{ai - 1} = 2024.

My goal is to find the sum of the elements of A, which is a1 + a2 + ... + an.

So I need to find a set A where the sum of 2^{(ai - 1)} for each ai in A equals 2024. Then, once I have such a set A, I can sum up its elements.

But how do I find such a set A? Well, maybe the elements of A are consecutive integers, starting from 1, or maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, 2024 is the total, so it's equal to the sum of 2^{a1-1} + 2^{a2-1} + ... + 2^{an-1}.

I know that 2024 is a specific number, so perhaps I can factor it or find a binary representation.

Let me compute 2024 in binary because powers of two come into play here.

2024 divided by 2: 1012
