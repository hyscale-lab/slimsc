Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down. First, I know that the minimal enclosing sphere of a rectangular box will have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius r would be half of that space diagonal. That makes sense.

So, if I can find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, then I can find the radius r. But wait, actually, the problem says it's the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes. So, the sphere must be big enough to contain any box from B. That means I need the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B, right? Because the sphere needs to fit the largest possible box.

Therefore, my goal is to maximize the space diagonal of the box given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Let me denote the edge lengths of the box as x, y, z. So, the space diagonal D is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). I need to maximize D given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, so that's equation one.

Volume is xyz = 23, that's equation two.

I need to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Or equivalently, maximize x² + y² + z².

So, set up the problem: maximize x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This seems like a constrained optimization problem. I can use Lagrange multipliers, but maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

I remember that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, from that, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz).

Given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, so (xy + yz + xz) = 27. Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, if I can find (x + y + z), then I can find x² + y² + z².

But I don't have a direct way to find x + y + z. Hmm. Let me think about other relations.

I also have the volume xyz = 23.

Wait, perhaps using the AM ≥ GM inequality or something similar.

But I'm not sure. Maybe we can let me set variables a = x, b = y, c = z.

Then, the problem is to maximize a² + b² + c² with 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Alternatively, perhaps I can reduce the problem to two variables.

Let me consider expressing one variable in terms of the others. For example, from the volume: z = 23/(xy).

Then, substitute into the surface area equation: 2(xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy))) = 54.

Let me compute that:

2[ xy + (23/(x)) + (23/(y)) ] = 54.

Divide both sides by 2:

xy + (23/x) + (23/y) = 27.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe I can let u = x + y and v = xy.

Wait, if I let u = x + y and v = xy, then perhaps I can express the equation in terms of u and v.

But let me see:

We have:

v + (23/x) + (23/y) = 27.

But (23/x) + (23/y) = 23(1/x + 1/y) = 23*(y + x)/(xy) = 23*u / v.

So, substituting back:

v + (23 u)/v = 27.

So, we have v + (23 u)/v = 27.

But I also know that for real numbers x and y, u² = x² + 2xy + y² ≥ 4xy = 4v, by AM ≥ GM.

But I'm not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, so the equation is v + (23 u)/v = 27. Let me denote this as equation (1): v + (23 u)/v = 27.

But I also have that the space diagonal squared, which is x² + y² + z², equals x² + y² + (23/(xy))².

Wait, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, since I have z =23/(xy), then x² + y² + z² = x² + y² + (23/(xy))².

But I also have that x² + y² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = u² - 2v.

So, x² + y² + z² = u² - 2v + (23/(xy))² = u² - 2v + (529)/(v²).

So, the function to maximize is f(u, v) = u² - 2v + 529/(v²).

But I also have equation (1): v + (23 u)/v = 27.

Let me see if I can express u in terms of v from equation (1):

From equation (1): 23 u = (27 - v) v.

So, u = [ (27 - v) v ] / 23.

So, u² = [ (27 - v)^2 v² ] / (23²).

So, now, substitute u² into f(u, v):

f(u, v) = [ (27 - v)^2 v² ] / 529 - 2v + 529/(v²).

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe I can set w = v and write f(w) as:

f(w) = [ (27 - w)^2 w² ] / 529 - 2w + 529/(w²).

This is a function of a single variable w. So, now I can try to find its maximum by taking the derivative with respect to w and setting it to zero.

But before I dive into calculus, perhaps I can assume some symmetry. Maybe the maximum occurs when the box is a cube or something close to it. But wait, the volume is 23, which is not a perfect cube, so maybe it's not a cube.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Let me suppose that x = y. Then, maybe the problem becomes easier.

Let me try that. Let x = y. Then, z = 23/(x²).

Surface area becomes 2(x² + x z + x z) = 2x² + 4x z = 54.

But z = 23/(x²), so:

2x² + 4x*(23/(x²)) = 54.

Simplify:

2x² + (92)/x = 54.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:

2x^3 + 92 = 54x.

Bring all terms to one side:

2x³ -54x +92 =0.

Divide both sides by 2:

x³ -27x +46 =0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation.

Let me see if there is an integer root. Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0.

x=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, factor out (x-2). Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x-2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
          2   4  -46
        1  2  -23   0

So, the cubic factors as (x -2)(x² + 2x -23)=0.

Set x² +2x -23=0.

Solutions: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4 sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6).

Since x is a length, it must be positive. So, x = -1 + 2 sqrt(6) ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

So, possible x values are x=2 and x= -1 + 2 sqrt(6).

So, for x=2, then y=2, z=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z²: 2² + 2² + (23/4)^2 = 4 +4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625, which is 41.0625.

Alternatively, in fraction: 8 is 128/16, so 128/16 + 529/16 = 657/16 ≈41.0625.

For x= -1 + 2 sqrt(6): Let me compute x² + y² + z². Since x=y, it's 2x² + z².

z =23/(x²). So, z² = (529)/(x^4).

So, let me compute x²:

x = -1 + 2 sqrt(6). Let's compute x²:

x² = (-1 + 2 sqrt(6))² = 1 -4 sqrt(6) + 24 =25 -4 sqrt(6).

So, 2x² = 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6))=50 -8 sqrt(6).

z² =529/(x^4). Hmm, x^4 is (25 -4 sqrt(6))².

Compute that: (25)^2 =625, (4 sqrt(6))²=16*6=96, cross terms: 2*25*(-4 sqrt(6))= -200 sqrt(6).

So, x^4 =625 - 200 sqrt(6) +96=721 -200 sqrt(6).

So, z²=529/(721 -200 sqrt(6)).

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe rationalizing the denominator.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (721 +200 sqrt(6)):

z²=529*(721 +200 sqrt(6)) / [ (721)^2 - (200 sqrt(6))^2 ]

Compute denominator:

721² = let's calculate 700² + 2*700*21 +21²=490000 + 29400 +441=520, 841?

Wait, 721 *721: 700²=490000, 2*700*21=2*14700=29400, 21²=441. So, total is 490000 +29400=519400 +441=519841.

Similarly, (200 sqrt(6))²=40000*6=240000.

So, denominator is 519841 -240000=279841.

So, z²=529*(721 +200 sqrt(6))/279841.

Wait, 279841 is 529 * 529. Because 529²=279841.

So, 529=23².

So, z²=529*(721 +200 sqrt(6))/(529²)= (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

So, z²= (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Therefore, x² + y² + z² = 2x² + z²= (50 -8 sqrt(6)) + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Hmm, let me write all in terms of a common denominator, which is 529.

So, 50 is 50*529/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8 sqrt(6)= -8 sqrt(6)*529/529= -4232 sqrt(6)/529.

So, 2x² + z²= [26450/529 -4232 sqrt(6)/529] + [721 +200 sqrt(6)]/529.

Combine the numerators:

26450 +721 =27171.

-4232 sqrt(6) +200 sqrt(6)= (-4032) sqrt(6).

So, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.

Wait, let me compute that:

27171 /529: 529*
