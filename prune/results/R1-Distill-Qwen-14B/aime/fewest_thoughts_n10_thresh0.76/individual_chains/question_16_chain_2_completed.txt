Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p squared divides some n^4 +1. Then, once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m that satisfies the divisibility condition.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, looking for primes p where p^2 divides n^4 + 1 for some n. So, for each prime, I need to check if there's an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to first consider modulo p, and then see if we can lift that solution to modulo p^2.

Because if n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, then maybe we can find an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2 using Hensel's lemma or something like that.

But first, for a prime p, I should check whether -1 is a quartic residue modulo p.

I remember that for primes p, the existence of solutions to x^k ≡ a mod p depends on the conditions related to the order of a modulo p and whether k divides the order.

Wait, but for the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p, I can think of it as x^8 ≡ 1 mod p, assuming that x^4 ≡ -1. So, the order of x modulo p would have to divide 8. Also, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, so 8 must divide p-1 for such elements x to exist.

So, p ≡ 1 mod 8, or maybe p=2?

Wait, wait. Let's think. For p=2, n^4 +1. Let's see, n even: n^4 is 0 mod 2, so n^4 +1 is 1 mod 2, which isn't divisible by 4. If n is odd: n^4 is 1 mod 2, so n^4 +1 is 2 mod 2, which is 0 mod 2, but not necessarily mod 4.

Wait, n^4 when n is odd: n is odd, so n=2k+1. Then (2k+1)^4 expands to... Well, modulo 4, any odd number is 1 mod 2, so (1)^4=1 mod 4. So, n^4 +1 is 2 mod 4, which isn't divisible by 4. So, for p=2, p^2=4, there's no n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 4. Because n^4 +1 is 2 mod 4 if n is odd, and 1 mod 4 if n is even. So, p=2 is out.

So, the primes we need to consider are odd primes where p≡1 mod 8. Because for x^4 ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, the multiplicative order of -1 must divide (p-1)/gcd(4,p-1). Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, let me recall Euler's criterion. For a prime p, -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. But here, we're dealing with quartic residues. So, to have x^4 ≡ -1 mod p, we need that -1 is a quartic residue. So, the conditions would be more restrictive.

So, first, for the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, it's necessary that the order of -1 in the multiplicative group modulo p divides (p-1)/4, perhaps?

Wait, maybe it's better to use the fact that if x^4 ≡ -1 mod p, then x^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So, the order of x modulo p would be 8, which must divide the order of the multiplicative group, which is p-1. Therefore, 8 must divide p-1, so p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, the primes p must be ≡1 mod 8. So, the smallest primes to consider are 17, 97, etc. Wait, no. Wait, 17 is 1 mod 8, yes, 17 is 1 more than 16, which is 2^4. Then 97 is next, but 41 is 1 mod 8 as well, since 40 is 8*5.

Wait, let me list primes ≡1 mod 8: 17, 97, 41, 73,  etc. Wait, is 17 the smallest? Let me check:

Primes less than 17: 2,3,5,7,11,13.

Check if any of these are 1 mod 8.

2: 2 mod8=2.

3:3.

5:5.

7:7.

11:3 mod8.

13:5 mod8.

So, yes, 17 is the smallest prime ≡1 mod8.

Wait, but wait, 17 is 1 mod 8. So, perhaps p=17 is the minimal prime where n^4 +1 is divisible by p^2.

But wait, maybe p=5 is possible? Let me check.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe p=5 could have n^4 +1 ≡0 mod25.

So, n^4 ≡24 mod25. Is 24 a quartic residue mod25?

Wait, maybe I can check for small n:

n=1: 1 mod25.

n=2: 16.

n=3:81≡6.

n=4:256≡6.

n=5:0.

n=6:6^4=1296. 1296/25=51*25=1275, so 1296-1275=21. So, 21 mod25.

n=7:7^4=49^2=2401. 2401 mod25: 2401/25=96*25=2400, so 2401≡1.

n=8:8^4=4096. 4096-25*163=4096-4075=21. So, 21.

n=9:9^4=6561. 6561-25*262=6561-6550=11.

n=10:0.

n=11:11^4=14641. 14641 mod25: 25*585=14625, so 14641-14625=16.

n=12:12^4=20736. 20736 mod25: 25*829=20725, 20736-20725=11.

n=13:13^4=28561. 28561 mod25: 25*1142=28550, 28561-28550=11.

n=14:14^4=38416. 38416 mod25: 38416-25*1536=38416-38400=16.

n=15:0.

n=16:16^4=65536. 65536 mod25: 65536 -25*2621=65536-65525=11.

n=17:17^4=83521. 83521 mod25: 83521-25*3340=83521-83500=21.

n=18:18^4=104976. 104976 mod25: 104976-25*4199=104976-104975=1.

n=19:19^4=130321. 130321 mod25: 130321-25*5212=130321-130300=21.

n=20:0.

n=21:21^4=194481. 194481 mod25: 194481-25*7779=194481-194475=6.

n=22:22^4=234256. 234256 mod25: 234256-25*9370=234256-234250=6.

n=23:23^4=279841. 279841-25*11193=279841-279825=16.

n=24:24^4=331776. 331776-25*13271=331776-331775=1.

Wait, so after checking n from 1 to 24 modulo25, I didn't find any n where n^4 ≡24 mod25. So, p=5 is out because n^4 ≡-1 mod25 has no solution. So, 5 is not a candidate.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 mod25 is 1, right? Because 25*96=2400, so 2401-2400=1. So, 7^4=1 mod25.

Similarly, n=18:18^4 mod25 is 1. So, perhaps 1 is a quartic residue, but 24 isn't.

Wait, so for p=5, p^2=25, and n^4 +1 mod25.

Looking for n where n^4 ≡24 mod25.

From the computations above, n=2 gives 16, n=3 gives 6, n=4 gives 6, n=6 gives 21, n=7 gives 1, n=8 gives 21, n=9 gives 11, n=10 gives 0, n=11 gives 16, n=12 gives 11, n=13 gives 11, n=14 gives 16, n=15 gives 0, n=16 gives 11, n=17 gives 21, n=18 gives 1, n=19 gives 21, n=20 gives 0, n=21 gives 6, n=22 gives 6, n=23 gives 16, n=24 gives 1.

So, no n in 1..24 satisfies n^4 ≡24 mod25. Hence, p=5 doesn't work.

Next prime is 13: 13 mod8=5, so not 1 mod8. So, the next candidate is 17.

So, p=17. Let me check if there's an n such that n^4 ≡-1 mod17^2=289.

Wait, maybe before that, let's check modulo17 first. Because if there's no solution mod17, there's no solution mod289.

So, check if x^4 ≡-1 mod17 has a solution.

Since 17≡1 mod8, perhaps it does.

Alternatively, let's compute x^4 mod17 for x=1 to 8, since in mod17, we can check up to 8 because of symmetry.

Compute x^4 mod17:

x=1:1

x=2:16

x=3:81 mod17: 81-4*17=81-68=13.

x=4:256 mod17. 256 /17: 17*15=255, so 256≡1.

x=5:625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13.

x=6:6^4=1296. 1296 mod17: 17*76=1292, so 1296-1292=4.

x=7:7^4=2401. 2401/17: 17*141=2397, so 2401-2397=4.

x=8:8^4=4096. 4096 mod17: 17*241=4097, so 4096≡-1 mod17.

Ah, so x=8: 8^4 ≡-1 mod17.

So, yes, there exists a solution mod17, and that's x=8. So, perhaps we can lift this solution to mod289 using Hensel's lemma.

So, the idea is that if f(x) = x^4 +1, then we have f(8) ≡0 mod17. We want to find an x ≡8 mod17 such that f(x) ≡0 mod289.

We can apply Hensel's lemma if f'(8) is not congruent to 0 mod17, which would allow us to lift the solution uniquely.

Compute f'(x) =4x^3.

So, f'(8) mod17: 4*(8)^3 mod17.

Compute 8^3=512. 512 mod17: 17*30=510, so 512≡2 mod17.

Then, 4*2=8 mod17. So, f'(8)=8 mod17, which is not zero. Therefore, Hensel's lemma applies, and there's a unique lift of 8 mod17 to a solution mod289.

So, let's denote x =8 +17k, where k is to be determined such that x^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Compute x^4 mod289.

Let’s expand (8 +17k)^4.

But that might be tedious, so let's compute step by step.

First, compute x =8 +17k. Let me compute x mod17=8, so x^4 ≡-1 mod17, as expected.

We can write x^4 ≡-1 +17*m for some integer m, and we need x^4 ≡-1 mod17^2, which is 289.

So, expanding x^4:

x^4 = (8 +17k)^4 = 8^4 +4*8^3*(17k) +6*8^2*(17k)^2 +4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Compute each term modulo289 (17^2):

17^2=289, so any term with 17^2 or higher power will be 0 mod289. So, up to the linear term in 17k:

x^4 ≈8^4 +4*8^3*(17k) mod289.

Compute each term:

8^4 =4096. 4096 mod289: 289*14=4046. 4096-4046=50. So, 8^4 ≡50 mod289.

4*8^3: 8^3=512. 512 mod289: 289*1=289, 512-289=223, so 8^3≡223 mod289. Then, 4*223=892. 892 mod289: 289*3=867, 892-867=25. So, 4*8^3 ≡25 mod289.

So, 4*8^3*(17k) ≡25*(17k) mod289.

So, x^4 ≡50 +25*17k mod289.

We need x^4 ≡-1 mod289, which is 288 mod289.

So, 50 +25*17k ≡288 mod289.

Compute 25*17=425. 425 mod289: 425-289=136.

So, 50 +136k ≡288 mod289.

Subtract 50 from both sides: 136k ≡238 mod289.

We can write this as 136k ≡238 mod289.

We can solve for k:

First, note that 136 and 289: since 289 is 17^2, and 136=8*17. So, gcd(136,289)=17.

Check if 17 divides 238: 238/17=14, yes. So, the equation is solvable.

Divide both sides by17:

(136/17)k ≡238/17 mod289/17.

136/17=8, 238/17=14, 289/17=17.

So, 8k ≡14 mod17.

Solve 8k ≡14 mod17.

Find the inverse of8 mod17. 8 and17 are coprime.

Find x such that8x ≡1 mod17.

8*2=16≡-1 mod17.

So, 8*(-2)=1 mod17. So, inverse of8 mod17 is -2≡15 mod17.

So, k≡15*14 mod17.

15*14=210.

210 mod17: 17*12=204, so 210-204=6.

So, k≡6 mod17.

So, the solution is k=6 +17t, where t is an integer. But since we're working mod289, and k is multiplied by17, the minimal solution for k is6.

Thus, x=8 +17k=8 +17*6=8 +102=110.

So, x=110 is a solution, but perhaps there's a smaller positive integer m=110 mod289.

Wait, but 110 is less than289, so that's the minimal positive integer.

Wait, but let me check if this is correct.

Compute 110^4 +1 mod289.

But computing 110^4 is a bit tedious. Alternatively, maybe we can compute it mod289 step by step.

Compute 110 mod289=110.

Compute 110^2: 110*110=12100.

12100 mod289: let's compute how many times 289 goes into 12100.

289*41=289*40 +289=11560 +289=11849.

12100 -11849=251. So, 110^2 ≡251 mod289.

Then, compute 251^2 mod289.

251^2=63001.

Compute 63001 mod289.

Find how many times 289 goes into 63001.

Well, 289*217=?

Let me compute 289*200=57800.

289*17=4913.

So, 289*217=57800+4913=62713.

63001-62713=288.

So, 251^2 ≡288 mod289. Which is -1 mod289.

So, 110^4=(110^2)^2≡251^2≡288≡-1 mod289.

So, 110^4 +1≡-1 +1≡0 mod289.

So, yes, m=110 is a solution.

But wait, is 110 the minimal positive integer m?

Wait, 110 is less than289, so it's the minimal positive solution. So, the minimal m is110.

Wait, but wait, another thing: perhaps there's a smaller m than110 that satisfies m^4 +1≡0 mod289.

Wait, but 289 is17^2, so the multiplicative group mod289 has order17^2 -1=288.

So, the solutions to m^4 ≡-1 mod289 would have orders dividing 8, because m^8≡1 mod289.

Wait, but 8 divides 288, so that's possible.

Wait, but the minimal solution might be less than110.

Wait, maybe I can check smaller numbers.

Wait, for example, 110-289= -179, but we are looking for positive integers, so 110 is the minimal positive.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another solution mod289.

Wait, but when we applied Hensel's lemma, we found x=8 mod17 lifted to x=110 mod289. So, perhaps the solutions are x=110 and x=-110 mod289, which is179.

So, 179 is another solution, but it's larger than110, so 110 is the minimal positive solution.

Therefore, the minimal positive integer m is110.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure there isn't a smaller m.

Wait, 110 is one solution. But perhaps another solution exists with m less than110.

Wait, let me think: in mod289, the solutions to x^4 ≡-1 would be x=110 and x=179, as above. So, 110 is less than179, so it's the minimal positive m.

So, to confirm:

We checked p=5: no solution.

Then p=17: yes, solution exists with m=110, which is the minimal positive integer.

Hence, the answer is110.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) with \( n^4 + 1 \) divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) for which \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step 1: Identify the smallest prime \( p \)

1. **Check primes less than 17**: For primes \( p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 \), we find that none satisfy \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod p^2 \) for any \( n \).
   
2. **Consider \( p = 17 \)**:
   - First, check modulo 17: Compute \( n^4 \mod 17 \) for \( n = 1, 2, \dots, 8 \). We find \( 8^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \), so \( n = 8 \) is a solution modulo 17.

### Step 2: Lift the solution to modulo \( 17^2 = 289 \) using Hensel's Lemma

1. **Apply Hensel's Lemma**:
   - Let \( f(x) = x^4 + 1 \) and \( f'(x) = 4x^3 \).
   - At \( x = 8 \), \( f(8) \equiv 0 \mod 17 \) and \( f'(8) \equiv 8 \mod 17 \), which is non-zero, so Hensel's Lemma applies.
   
2. **Find \( k \) such that \( x = 8 + 17k \)**:
   - Expand \( (8 + 17k)^4 \mod 289 \) and solve for \( k \) to satisfy \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod 289 \).
   - After calculations, we find \( k = 6 \), leading to \( x = 110 \).

### Step 3: Verify \( m = 110 \) is the minimal solution

1. **Check \( 110^4 + 1 \mod 289 \)**:
   - Compute \( 110^2 \equiv 251 \mod 289 \) and \( 251^2 \equiv 288 \equiv -1 \mod 289 \).
   - Thus, \( 110^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 289 \).

2. **Confirm minimality**:
   - Since \( 110 < 289 \) and no smaller positive integer satisfies the condition, \( m = 110 \) is the minimal solution.

### Final Answer

The least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \(\boxed{110}\).
