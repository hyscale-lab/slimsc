Okay, let's try to solve this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, right? And some points are collinear: D, E, C, F. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. So, rectangle ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle with sides EF, FG, GH, HE.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, that means these four points lie on the same straight line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the circumference of a circle. That should give us some properties to work with, maybe something related to cyclic quadrilaterals.

Let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is a vertical side if I imagine the rectangle upright. So, BC = 16, which means AD = 16 as well because opposite sides in a rectangle are equal.

- AB = 107. AB is the base of the rectangle, so the horizontal side. So, AB = CD = 107.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH:

- FG = 17. So, FG is one of the vertical sides. Since EF is given as 184, which is the horizontal side. So, EF = 184, FG = 17, so GH = 184 and HE = 17.

So, the two rectangles are placed in such a way that D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm. Let me think about how they could be positioned.

Since both are rectangles, and D and C are adjacent corners of ABCD, E and F are adjacent corners of EFGH, and they lie on the same line. So, perhaps the line D-E-C-F is a straight line that connects these points.

I think the key here is to figure out the positions of these rectangles relative to each other. Maybe one rectangle is attached to the other along this line D-E-C-F.

Given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle, perhaps this gives us a cyclic quadrilateral, so we can apply the cyclic quadrilateral properties, like the power of a point or something related to the intersecting chords.

Wait, since A, D, H, G are on a circle, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, the opposite angles of this quadrilateral should sum to 180 degrees. Alternatively, the power of a point might come into play if lines intersect outside the circle.

But perhaps more straightforward is to use coordinates. Let's assign coordinate systems to the points to model the problem mathematically.

Let's set a coordinate system where point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then:

- If ABCD is placed with D at (0,0), then since AB is 107 and BC is 16, the coordinates of the other points would be:

- Point A: Since AB is horizontal, and AB=107, then A would be at (107, 0). Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a rectangle, the sides are connected in order, so if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (0, BC). Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the points are labeled in order. So, ABCD would have AB, BC, CD, DA as sides. So, starting at A, moving to B, then to C, then to D, then back to A.

Wait, maybe it's better to fix the coordinate system such that point D is at (0,0). Let me define the rectangle ABCD as follows:

- Point D: (0,0)
- Point C: (0, BC) since BC is vertical. BC is 16, so C is at (0,16).
- Point B: Since AB is 107 and ABCD is a rectangle, AB is horizontal. So, point B is at (107,16).
- Point A: Then, since AD is vertical, from D(0,0) to A(0, something). Wait, but AB is 107, which is horizontal, so from A to B is 107 units
