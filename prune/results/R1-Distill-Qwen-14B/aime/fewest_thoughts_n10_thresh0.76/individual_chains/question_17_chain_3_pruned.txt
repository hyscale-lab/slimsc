Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm, let me start by recalling that for a rectangular box with length, width, and height as x, y, z, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume is xyz. 

Given that the surface area is 54, so:
2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
Which simplifies to:
xy + yz + zx = 27

And the volume is 23, so:
xyz = 23

Okay, so we have two equations:
1. xy + yz + zx = 27
2. xyz = 23

Now, the sphere that contains the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So the radius r of the sphere is d/2. Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So I need to find x² + y² + z² and then divide by 4. To find x² + y² + z², I can use the identity:

(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx)

I know that xy + yz + zx is 27, so:

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2*27 = (x + y + z)² - 54

But I don't know x + y + z. Hmm, maybe I can find an expression for x + y + z in terms of other variables? Alternatively, perhaps I can maximize or find the minimum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints.

Wait, but I think since we're trying to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box, the sphere must be large enough to contain the box with the maximum space diagonal. So I think I need to maximize x² + y² + z² given that the surface area is 54 and volume is 23.

So perhaps I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

This seems like a constrained optimization problem. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers? Or perhaps find a relationship between the variables to express it in terms of fewer variables.

Let me consider symmetry. If the box is a cube, then x = y = z. Let's see if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, so x = 3. Then the volume would be 3³ = 27. But in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So the box can't be a cube. Thus, the optimal box (that requires the largest sphere) might not be a cube. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe two sides are equal, making it a square-based box. Let's assume that x = y, so the box is a square prism.

Then, let me set x = y, so variables are x, x, z.

Then, surface area: 2(x² + xz + xz) = 2x² + 4xz = 54
So, x² + 2xz = 27.

Volume: x² z = 23.

I can solve these two equations for x and z.

From the volume equation: z = 23/(x²)

Plugging into the surface area equation:
x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27
Simplify:
x² + (46/x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:
x³ + 46 = 27x
Bring all terms to one side:
x³ -27x +46 = 0

So, I need to solve x³ -27x +46 = 0.

Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 divided by factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, factor out (x -2) from x³ -27x +46.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46 (constant)

Divide by x=2:

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1*2=2. Add to next coefficient: 0+2=2.

Multiply 2*2=4. Add to next coefficient: -27+4=-23.

Multiply -23*2=-46. Add to 46: 0.

So, the polynomial factors as (x-2)(x² + 2x -23)=0.

Set each factor to zero:

x-2=0 → x=2

x² +2x -23=0 → x=(-2 ± sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

Since x must be positive, x = -1 + 2√6.

So, the roots are x=2, x=-1+2√6, x=-1-2√6. The last is negative, so discard.

So, possible x values are 2 and -1+2√6 (~3.449).

So, for x=2, z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75. So, the box is 2x2x5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z² for x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

Which is 4 +4 + (5.75)^2.

5.75 squared is 33.0625. So total is 4+4+33.0625=41.0625, which is 41.0625.

Alternatively, for x = -1 + 2√6, let's compute x numerically: sqrt(6) is about 2.449, so 2*2.449=4.898, minus 1 is 3.898. So x≈3.898. Then, z=23/(x²). Compute x²: approx 3.898^2 = ~15.19.

So z≈23/15.19≈1.515.

Then, compute x² + y² + z². Since x = y, it's 2x² + z².

2*(15.19) + (1.515)^2≈30.38 + 2.296≈32.676.

Comparing the two, 32.676 is less than 41.0625. So, when x=2, the sum is larger. So, perhaps the maximum x² + y² + z² occurs when x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

But wait, maybe I should check if there are other configurations where x, y, z are all different, leading to a larger x² + y² + z².

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal, as we considered.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the problem.

We need to maximize f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z²

Subject to constraints:

g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + zx =27

h(x,y,z) = xyz=23

So, we can use Lagrange multipliers with two constraints.

Set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx -27) - μ(xyz -23)

Take partial derivatives:

dL/dx = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

dL/dy = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

dL/dz = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx =27

xyz=23

So, we have a system of equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)

2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)

3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)

4. xy + yz +zx =27

5. xyz=23

This looks complicated, but perhaps we can find a symmetric solution.

Suppose that two variables are equal, say x=y.

Then, from 1 and 2, since x=y, let's substitute.

Equation 1: 2x = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)

Equation 2: 2x = λ(x + z) + μ(xz) [same as equation 1]

Equation 3: 2z = λ(2x) + μ(x²)

So, equations 1 and 2 are the same, and equation 3 is different.

So, we have:

From equation 1: 2x = λ(x + z) + μ x z

From equation 3: 2z = 2 λ x + μ x²

And constraints:

x² + 2x z =27

x² z=23

Which is the same as what we had when assuming x=y.

So, solving these equations would lead us back to the case where x=2, y=2, z=23/4, which gives x² + y² + z²=4 +4 + (23/4)^2= 8 + 529/16 = (128 +529)/16=657/16≈41.0625.

Alternatively, when x=-1 + 2√6, which is approximately 3.898, but that gives a lower x² + y² + z².

So, perhaps the maximum x² + y² + z² is 657/16, which occurs when x=y=2, z=23/4.

But wait, is that the maximum? Or could there be a case where all three variables are different, leading to a larger sum?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the box is as "stretched out" as possible, which might happen when one dimension is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible, given the constraints.

But that's a bit vague. Maybe I should check if when all three variables are equal, but we saw that for a cube, the volume is too high, so it's not possible. So, perhaps the maximum is when x=y=2, z=23/4.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the problem in terms of variables a, b, c, which are the edges. Using AM >= GM or other inequalities.

Wait, but in our case, the variables are constrained by two equations, so maybe I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of variables.

Wait, another thought: From the surface area, we have xy + yz + zx =27. From the volume, xyz=23.
