Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has two important centers: the circumcenter (O) and the incenter (I). The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

The goal is to find the product of the lengths of sides AB and AC. So, AB * AC. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c, and the area. The formula is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area. The inradius r is related to the area and the semi-perimeter: r = Δ/s, where s is the semi-perimeter, (a + b + c)/2.

Given that, we know R = 13 and r = 6. So, R = 13, r = 6.

Also, we have that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. IA is the line from the incenter to vertex A, and OI is the line connecting the circumcenter and incenter.

I think I should recall some properties or formulas that relate the inradius, circumradius, and the distance between the incenter and circumcenter.

Wait, yes, there's a formula that relates OI (the distance between the inradius and circumradius) with other elements of the triangle. The formula is OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me confirm that. Hmm, I think that's correct. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Let me write that down.

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Given R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI².

OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13*(1) = 13.

So, OI = sqrt(13). That's useful.

Now, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA ⊥ OI.

Let me visualize this. The incenter I is connected to vertex A, and the line from I to O is perpendicular to IA.

Wait, maybe I can consider the coordinates or use vector methods? Alternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric relation I can use.

Alternatively, perhaps coordinate geometry could be useful here. Let me set up a coordinate system to model this.

Let me place point O at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since O is the circumcenter, the triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle of radius 13 centered at O.

The incenter I is at some point (x, y). The line OI has direction vector (x, y), and IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, point A is a vertex of the triangle.
