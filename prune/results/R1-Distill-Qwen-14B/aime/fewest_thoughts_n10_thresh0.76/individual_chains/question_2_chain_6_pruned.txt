Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC² where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me try to unpack the problem step by step.

First, let me parse the given information. We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is somewhere on the x-axis, and B is somewhere on the y-axis. The segment AB connects these two points. 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is a line segment from some point P(p, 0) to some point Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1. So, for each such segment, p² + q² = 1 since the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) would be sqrt(p² + q²), and that equals 1.

Now, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, for all these other segments PQ in F, C isn't on them, but C is on AB. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Hmm. So, I think the strategy here is to parametrize point C on AB and then find conditions under which this point C doesn't lie on any other segment PQ from the family F except for AB itself.

First, let me find the equation of line AB. Points A are at (1/2, 0) and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), since it passes through A(1/2, 0). Let me confirm that: when x = 1/2, y = 0. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can write it in intercept form: x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1. So, 2x + (2y)/sqrt(3) = 1.

But maybe parametric equations would be more useful here. Let me parameterize AB. Let's let t vary from 0 to 1, where t=0 corresponds to point A and t=1 corresponds to point B. So, the parametric equations would be x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2)t. That way, when t=0, x=1/2, y=0 (point A), and when t=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2 (point B). So, point C can be represented as ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2)t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

So, OC² would be x² + y². Plugging in, that's [(1 - t)/2]^2 + [(sqrt(3)/2 t]^2. Let me compute that: (1 - 2t + t²)/4 + (3 t²)/4 = [1 - 2t + t² + 3t²]/4 = [1 - 2t + 4t²]/4. So, OC² = (4t² - 2t + 1)/4.

But I don't know t yet. The key is to find t such that point C does not lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB itself. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, what's the condition for point C lying on a segment PQ?

Given that PQ is a segment from P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), with p² + q² = 1. The parametric equation for PQ can be written as (x, y) = (p(1 - s), q s) where s ranges from 0 to 1. So, any point on PQ can be written as (p(1 - s), q s) for some s between 0 and 1.

So, if point C is on PQ, then there exists s such that:

(1 - t)/2 = p(1 - s)

and

(sqrt(3)/2) t = q s.

Since p² + q² =1, because PQ is of unit length.

So, given that point C is on AB and also on PQ (another segment from F), then these equations must hold for some s and p, q with p² + q² =1.

We want to find the C on AB such that the only PQ from F that contains C is AB itself.

So, for all other PQ segments in F, the system of equations:

(1 - t)/2 = p(1 - s)

(sqrt(3)/2) t = q s

p² + q² =1

has no solution. But for AB itself, which is also a member of F, this system does have a solution.

So, for the point C, when we plug into the equations, we must have that the only solution is when PQ is AB. So, other PQs in F must not have solutions for these equations when C is plugged in.

Alternatively, for point C, when we write the system for some PQ ≠ AB, there's no solution (s, p, q) that satisfies the equations with p² + q²=1.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to find t such that the line PQ (for some p and q with p² + q²=1) passes through C, but since C is on AB, which is already in F, we need to ensure that no other PQ in F passes through C.

So, maybe the condition is that C is the only point on AB that lies on AB itself among all the PQs in F. So, for other PQs, the lines don't pass through C.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for point C, the line AB is the only PQ in F that contains C. So, if I write the equation of AB as y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, since when x=0, y= sqrt(3)/2 and when x=1/2, y=0.

Wait, earlier I had the equation as y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, yes, that's correct.

Now, for other PQ segments in F, which are lines from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² =1, we can write their equations as x/p + y/q =1.

So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q =1.

Now, if point C is not on any other PQ's line except AB, then the system:

x/p + y/q = 1

and

y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2

has no solution except when PQ is AB.

Wait, but AB is itself a PQ in F. So, AB is PQ with p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2, because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2, and p² + q² = (1/4) + (3/4) =1, which checks out.

So, AB is a PQ in F, and it's the only one that contains point C. So, for other PQs, the line x/p + y/q =1 should not pass through point C.

So, for point C, which is ((1-t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)t ), we can plug into the equation x/p + y/q =1.

So, ((1-t)/2)/p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / q = 1.

But for this to be true, it would require that p and q satisfy:

(1-t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 q) = 1.

But for other PQs in F (so p² + q²=1), we don't want this equation to hold except when p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, for point C, if we plug into the equation of PQ, we get:

( (1 - t)/2 )/p + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 )/q = 1.

Multiplying both sides by 2:

(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.

Now, for a given t, this is an equation in p and q. But since p² + q²=1, we can consider this as a system of equations:

(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2,

p² + q² =1.

We can solve this system for p and q, and we want this system to have only one solution when p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2. So, for other values of p and q on the unit circle, this equation shouldn't hold.

So, perhaps we can find t such that the system has exactly one solution (p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2). So, the solution is unique.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as the point C lying on AB, and we need to make sure that for all other PQs in F, the point C is not on PQ. So, the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2 must have no solutions except when p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2.

So, perhaps we can consider the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2, along with p² + q² = 1
