Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, let me recall some concepts. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumradius is given as 13, and the inradius is 6.

The triangle has circumcenter O and incenter I. The incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from O to I.

I think I need to find some relationship between the sides of the triangle. The problem asks for AB multiplied by AC, so that's the product of two sides. Let me denote AB as c, AC as b, and BC as a. So, the sides opposite angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively. Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC, opposite angle B; c is AB, opposite angle C. So, AB is c, AC is b, and BC is a. So, the product we need is b*c.

I remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can sometimes be related to other elements like the area, semiperimeter, etc. Maybe I can find expressions involving b and c.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a key condition. Let me think about that. IA is the line from incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the line from circumcenter O to incenter I. So, IA is perpendicular to OI, which means that the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees.

I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this. Let me sketch triangle ABC with incenter I and circumcenter O. IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm. I recall that in some triangles, the incenter and circumcenter can have particular relationships, but I'm not sure about this specific case.

Let me think about properties involving the inradius (r) and the circumradius (R). I know that for any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r))

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. Yes, I think that's a known formula. So, OI squared is equal to R(R - 2r). Let me compute that. R is 13, r is 6.

So, OI^2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI is sqrt(13).

But wait, we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle at I. So, in triangle IAO, we have that angle at
