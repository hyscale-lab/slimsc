Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by revolving a circle around an axis that's in the plane of the circle but doesn't pass through the center. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the torus would have two main measurements: the major radius, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus (which is 6 here), and the minor radius, which is the radius of the tube itself (3 here).

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside or the outside of this sphere. When it's inside, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm. So, I think I need to figure out the radii of these tangent circles in both cases. Let me think about how the torus and sphere interact.

First, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the sphere is larger, so the torus fits inside. The point of tangency would be a circle on both the sphere and the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's larger, and the sphere is inside, touching the torus along another circle.

I remember that the sphere and the torus are both surfaces of revolution, so maybe we can model this in a cross-sectional view. Let me try to think in 2D first, like a cross-section through the axis of the torus.

In the cross-section, the torus would look like two circles: the outer circle with radius 6 + 3 = 9, and the inner circle with radius 6 - 3 = 3. The sphere, when intersected with this plane, would be a circle with radius 11. 

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere touches the torus at the "top" and "bottom" of the torus. So, the point of tangency is at the farthest point from the center of the sphere. Wait, no. Maybe it's the point where the sphere just touches the outer part of the torus.

Wait, no, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is bigger, so the point of tangency is where the sphere just touches the outer surface of the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside, so the point of tangency is where the sphere just touches the inner surface of the torus.

Let me think about the internal tangent case. The torus is inside the sphere. The sphere has a radius of 11. The torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3. So, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be such that the sphere touches the torus externally.

Wait, maybe I should model this as the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus's center. Let me denote the center of the sphere as point O, and the center of the torus (the center around which the circle is revolved) as point C. 

In the internal tangent case, the sphere and torus touch along a circle. So, the distance between O and C must be equal to the sum of their radii minus the minor radius of the torus? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the torus is inside the sphere. So, the sphere's center is at some distance from the torus's center. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus's outer radius is 6 + 3 = 9. So, if the sphere is to contain the torus and be tangent
