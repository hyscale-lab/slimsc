Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. I need to figure out how many own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me list out the given numbers:

- Total residents: 900.

- Number owning a diamond ring (let's call this set D): 195.

- Number owning a set of golf clubs (set G): 367.

- Number owning a garden spade (set S): 562.

- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (set C), so that's 900.

Wait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, C has 900 members. Oh, that's the whole population.

Next, it mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things. And 234 own exactly three of them. I'm supposed to find how many own all four.

Hmm, so this is a problem involving sets and their intersections. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let's recall that formula.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is:

Total = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think if there's another way.

Wait, the problem states that 437 own exactly two things and 234 own exactly three. Also, the number who own all four is what we're looking for. Let's denote the number who own all four as x.

So, how does this fit into the inclusion-exclusion principle?

Wait, let me think about the different cases of ownership.

Each resident can own 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of these items. But since everyone owns the candy hearts, which is one item, no one owns zero. So, everyone owns at least one item.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, yes, C is 900, so everyone owns C. So, the minimum number of items each resident owns is 1, and the maximum is 4.

So, the total number of residents is 900, and each of them has at least one of the four items.

Now, let's consider the number of people who own exactly 1, exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 items.

But the problem gives us the numbers for exactly 2 and exactly 3. So, 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and the rest must own exactly one or exactly four.

Wait, but wait: the problem says that 437 own exactly two, 234 exactly three, and we need to
