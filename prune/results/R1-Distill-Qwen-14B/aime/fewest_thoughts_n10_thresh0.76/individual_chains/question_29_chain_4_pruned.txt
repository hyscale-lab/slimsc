Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me visualize this. So, rectangle ABCD has sides AB=107 and BC=16. That means AB is the longer side, so ABCD is a tall, narrow rectangle. Then there's another rectangle EFGH with sides FG=17 and EF=184, which is a much longer and wider rectangle.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they must lie on a straight line. So, I imagine that line as maybe the base or top of the two rectangles? Not sure yet. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That seems important because four points lying on a circle means they're concyclic or lie on the same circumference. So, maybe that can give us some properties to work with, like cyclic quadrilaterals.

Let me try to sketch this in my mind. Rectangle ABCD: Let's say A is at the top-left, B at top-right, C at bottom-right, D at bottom-left. Then rectangle EFGH: E at top-left, F at top-right, G at bottom-right, H at bottom-left. Wait, but according to the problem, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D is on the bottom-left of ABCD, and E is on the top-left of EFGH. If they are collinear with C and F, which are the bottom-right of ABCD and top-right of EFGH, perhaps the line passes through the bottom of ABCD and the top of EFGH?

Alternatively, maybe E is somewhere along DC, and F is another point on DC? Wait, but in that case, D, E, C, F being collinear would mean E and F are on DC. But E is part of rectangle EFGH. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to the points to get a clearer picture. Let me assign coordinates to rectangle ABCD.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (BC,0) = (16,0). Then point B would be at (16, AB) = (16,107), and point A would be at (0,107).

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in a rectangle, the sides AB and BC are adjacent, so if ABCD is labeled in order, it's A, B, C, D. So, AB is one side, BC is the next. So, if I place point D at (0,0), then since DC is BC=16, point C is at (16,0). Then, since BC is 16 and AB is 107, the height from B to C is 16, but AB is the vertical side. Wait, no, AB is 107, so AB is the vertical side. So, point A would be at (0, 16), but wait, no, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe it's better to define ABCD with AB as the base. Wait, no, the problem says BC=16 and AB=107. So, in rectangle ABCD, AB is adjacent to BC. So, if ABCD is a rectangle, then AB and BC are perpendicular. So, if AB is 107, BC is 16, then ABCD is a rectangle with length AB=107 and height BC=16.

So, perhaps assigning coordinates as follows: Let me place point D at (0,0). Then, since DC is BC=16, point C is at (16,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point B would be at (16,107), and point A at (0,107). Wait, that makes sense. Because AB is 107 units long, from (0,107) to (16,107), but that would make AB diagonal, which isn't correct because AB should be a side, not a diagonal.

Oh wait, no, if D is at (0,0), then moving along DC to C is 16 units, so C is (16,0). Then, moving up from C to B is 107 units, so point B is (16,107). Then, moving left from B to A is 16 units again, but wait, no, AB should be 107. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as AB being the vertical side. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (x,0), and B would be at (x, y), and A at (0, y). But wait, that's a rectangle. So, AB is vertical, BC is horizontal.

Wait, in that case, AB would be the height, BC the base. So, AB=107, BC=16.

So, point D is (0,0), point C is (16,0), point B is (16,107), and point A is (0,107). That makes ABCD a rectangle with width 16
