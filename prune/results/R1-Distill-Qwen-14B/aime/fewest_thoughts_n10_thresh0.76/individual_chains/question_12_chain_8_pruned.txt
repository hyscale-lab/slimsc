Okay, so I've got this math problem here about filling a 2x3 grid with digits. The goal is to have the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right equal 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom equal 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So, the first row has three cells, and the second row has three cells. Let me denote the grid like this:

```
a b c
d e f
```

Where a, b, c are the first row, and d, e, f are the second row. Each of these letters represents a single digit (0-9).

Now, the problem says that reading left to right gives two numbers. So, I think that means the first row is a three-digit number, abc, and the second row is another three-digit number, def. So, the sum of abc and def should be 999. 

Wait, hold on. Wait, the example given in the problem is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

So, the first number is 008, which is 8, and the second is 991. 8 + 991 = 999, which matches. So, the left-to-right reading is each row as a number, and their sum is 999.

Similarly, reading top to bottom gives three numbers. So, the first column is a two-digit number ad, the second column is be, and the third column is cf. So, ad + be + cf = 99. 

In the example, ad is 09, which is 9, be is 09, which is 9, and cf is 81. 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. That's correct.

So, the problem is to find the number of ways to fill the grid with digits so that:

1. The sum of the two three-digit numbers (abc and def) is 999.
2. The sum of the three two-digit numbers (ad, be, cf) is 99.

I need to find how many such grids exist.

Let me think about the first condition: abc + def = 999.

Since abc and def are both three-digit numbers, their sum is 999. So, each of them must be a three-digit number, right? Because if abc were less than 100, then def would have to be 999 - abc, which would be at least 900, but it's a three-digit number. Wait, actually, for abc, if a is zero, then abc would be a two-digit or one-digit number. Hmm, but in the example, the first row is 008, which is treated as 8, so maybe it's allowed to have leading zeros. So, each row is a three-digit number, possibly with leading zeros.

So, abc and def are each three-digit numbers (including leading zeros), and their sum is 999.

Similarly, the columns: each is a two-digit number, possibly with leading zeros. So, ad, be, cf are two-digit numbers (e.g., 09 is 9), and their sum is 99.

So, the problem is to fill the grid such that:

- abc + def = 999
- ad + be + cf = 99

We need to find the number of possible grids (i.e., assignments of digits a,b,c,d,e,f) satisfying these two equations.

Let me represent these as equations.

First, the sum of the two three-digit numbers:

Let me write abc as 100a + 10b + c,
def as 100d + 10e + f.
So, 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Which can be rewritten as 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly, the sum of the three two-digit numbers:

ad is 10a + d,
be is 10b + e,
cf is 10c + f.
So, (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me rewrite this as 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So now, I have two equations:

1. 100(a + d
