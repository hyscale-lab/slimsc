Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me break this down. So Alice picks a set A, and then Bob considers all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum of B is an element of A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of elements in A.

First, maybe I should figure out how the size of A relates to the number of sets B that Bob can list. Let's think about it. If A has some elements, say a1, a2, ..., an, then for each ai in A, Bob can form sets where ai is the maximum element.

What's the number of such sets? Well, if the maximum element is ai, then the other elements of B must be less than ai. So for each ai, the number of possible subsets B where the maximum is ai is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, plus the set containing just ai itself. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, actually, for each ai, the sets B with maximum ai can be constructed by selecting any subset of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} and then adding ai to it. So the number of such subsets is 2^{ai-1}. Because each element less than ai can be either included or excluded.

But wait, each ai is a positive integer, so they are ordered. But does A have to be ordered? Or is it just a set, so the elements can be in any order? But when we talk about the maximum, it's about the largest element in B, so the order of the elements in A doesn't matter for the count. So A is just a set of positive integers, say {a1, a2, ..., an} where a1 < a2 < ... < an} for simplicity.

Then, for each ai, the number of sets B where the maximum is ai is 2^{ai -1}. Because for each element less than ai, you can choose to include it or not. So the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over each ai in A of 2^{ai -1}.

But wait, is that correct? Let's take a small example. Suppose A = {1}. Then the only set B possible is {1}, since the maximum has to be in A. So the number of sets is 1, which is 2^{1-1} = 1. That works.

Another example: if A = {2}. Then B can be {2}, or any subset of {1} with 2 added. So {2}, {1,2}. So that's 2 sets. 2^{2-1} = 2. So yes, that works.

Another example: A = {1, 2}. Then for ai=1: 2^{0}=1 set ({1}). For ai=2: 2^{1}=2 sets ({2}, {1,2}). So total sets is 1 +
