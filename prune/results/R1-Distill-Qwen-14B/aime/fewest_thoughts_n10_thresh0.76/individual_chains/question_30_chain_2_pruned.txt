Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's not equal to 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct. So, they form the set of all 13th roots of unity except 1. 

The product I need to compute is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that as Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). 

I wonder if there's a way to simplify each term in the product. Let's look at the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor it or rewrite it in a more manageable form.

Let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, perhaps I can factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Let's denote x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x². So, 2 - 2x + x². Let me rearrange that: x² - 2x + 2. 

So, each term is x² - 2x + 2 where x = ω^k. So, the product becomes Π_{x=ω^k} (x² - 2x + 2) for x ranging over all 13th roots of unity except 1? Wait, no, when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so that term is included. So, actually, x runs through all 13th roots of unity, including 1. Because k goes from 0 to 12, so ω^0 is 1, and ω^1 to ω^{12} are the other roots.

So, the product is the product over all x where x is a 13th root of unity of (x² - 2x + 2). That is, the product is equal to Π_{x ∈ Roots}(x² - 2x + 2), where Roots are all the 13th roots of unity.

Hmm, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - α) where α are the roots gives us the minimal polynomial. But here, it's not just x -
