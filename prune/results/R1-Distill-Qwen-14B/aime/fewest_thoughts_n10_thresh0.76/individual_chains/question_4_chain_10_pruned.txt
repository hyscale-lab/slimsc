Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how these kinds of games work. It's similar to the classic Nim game, but with specific move options. So, each player can take 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The key is to find the losing positions, which are the numbers n where the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

Wait, so in this context, a losing position for the current player would mean that no matter what move they make (taking 1 or 4 tokens), the opponent can always respond in a way that leads to the current player's loss. Conversely, a winning position is one where the current player can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position.

So, to model this, I should probably look for patterns or cycles in the winning and losing positions. Let me try to list out the positions starting from n=1 and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and false otherwise.

Base cases:
- P(0): Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over. But since the last token was taken by the previous player, the current player (who is to move) loses. So P(0) is false because the current player can't make a move.
- P(1): The current player can take 1 token and win. So P(1) is true.
- P(2): The current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. Since P(1) is true, the opponent can then take that 1 and win. Wait, but that would mean P(2) is false? Wait, no. Wait, if the current player takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So the current player can't force a win, meaning P(2) is false. Alternatively, the current player could take 4 tokens, but n=2, so they can't take 4. So P(2) is false.

Wait no, hold on. Let me correct that. For P(2), the current player can only take 1 token because they can't take 4. So after taking 1, the opponent is left with 1 token, which is a winning position for them. So the current player can't force a win, so P(2) is false.

Similarly, for P(3):
- The current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for the opponent (since P(2) is false). So if the current player takes 1, the opponent is left with a losing position, so P(3) would be true.

Wait, so if P(3) is true, that means the current player can take 1, leaving the opponent with n=2, which is a losing position for them. So yes, P(3) is true.

Now P(4):
- The current player can take 1, leaving n=3. Since P
