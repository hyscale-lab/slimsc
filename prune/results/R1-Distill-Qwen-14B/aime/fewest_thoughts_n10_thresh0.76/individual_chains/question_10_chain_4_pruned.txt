Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what Bob is doing. He's creating sets B where each B is a finite, nonempty set of positive integers, and the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum, and the rest of the elements are less than a.

Wait, so for each a in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, right? Because each such B must include a and any combination of numbers less than a. Since B has to be nonempty, and the maximum is a, the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty subset? Wait no, because B has to be nonempty. So for each a, the number of possible Bs is 2^{a-1}. Because the subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} include the empty set. So for each a, the number of sets B where max(B) = a is 2^{a-1}.

But wait, no. Because B has to be a nonempty set, so when a is the maximum, the set B can be just {a}, or {a, x} where x is less than a, etc. So yes, the number is 2^{a-1} because for each element less than a, you can choose whether to include it or not, but since B has to include a, the rest can be any subset of the lower numbers.

So the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over a in A of 2^{a-1}. And the problem says that this sum is 2024. So:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So I need to find the set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A equals 2024. Then, the question is asking for the sum of the elements of
