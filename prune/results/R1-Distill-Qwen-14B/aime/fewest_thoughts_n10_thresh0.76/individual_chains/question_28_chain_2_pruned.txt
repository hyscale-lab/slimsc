Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (which is like the 3D equivalent of the incenter in a triangle) to each of the faces. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I need to find m + n + p.

First, I need to get a clear picture of the tetrahedron. The edges are given in pairs: AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. So, it seems like the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron, opposite edges are equal, which is exactly the case here. So, I think that might help because such tetrahedrons have some nice properties, like having an incenter and that the inradius can be found using a formula.

Wait, what's the inradius in a tetrahedron? In a triangle, the inradius is the radius of the incircle, which is tangent to all three sides. In a tetrahedron, the inradius is the radius of the inscribed sphere (inradius) that is tangent to all four faces. This point where the distances to each face are equal is called the incenter.

So, how do I find the inradius? I think the formula is similar to the triangle case but in 3D. For a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume V divided by the total surface area S. So, r = 3V/S. That makes sense because in a tetrahedron, the volume can be related to the inradius and the surface area.

So, my plan is to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, then compute r = 3V/S.

But wait, how do I compute the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edges? I don't have any face areas or coordinates, so maybe I need another approach. Hmm, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. I've heard of that before; it's a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron based on the lengths of its edges.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume V = √[ determinant / 288 ]

Where the determinant is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, I need to plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant. But first, let's note down all the edges.

Given:
AB = √41, so a² = 41
AC = √80, so b² = 80
AD = √89, so c² = 89
BC = √89, so d² = 89
BD = √80, so e² = 80
CD = √41, so f² = 41

So, plugging these into the Cayley-Menger matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Hmm, looks symmetric. So, the determinant might simplify nicely.

Calculating the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is going to be a bit tedious, but maybe there's some symmetry we can exploit here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of an isosceles tetrahedron. I recall that for a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, it's called a disphenoid. And for a disphenoid, the volume can be found using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² +
