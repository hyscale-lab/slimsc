Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges have specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter point I to each face, and express it in the form m sqrt(n)/p, then find m + n + p.

Hmm, tetrahedrons can be tricky, especially with all these edge lengths. But the key here is that it's an isosceles tetrahedron because all opposite edges are equal. I remember that in such tetrahedrons, the incenter coincides with the centroid, circumcenter, and orthocenter. So maybe I can use some properties of isosceles tetrahedrons to simplify the problem.

First, maybe I should find the volume of the tetrahedron. Once I have the volume, I can relate it to the inradius using the formula Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. Wait, actually, for a tetrahedron, the formula is similar to a triangle's area = (1/3)*perimeter*inradius, but in 3D, it's Volume = (1/3) * (sum of areas of faces) * inradius. So the inradius r = 3 * Volume / Surface Area.

So, I need to compute the volume and the total surface area.

But how do I compute the volume of this tetrahedron? Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. I think there's a formula for the volume of an isosceles tetrahedron. Let me recall... Oh, right! If it's an isosceles tetrahedron, it can be inscribed in a rectangular box. The formula for the volume is sqrt( (a² + b² + c²)/4 * (a² + b² + c² - d² - e² - f²)/4 ), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Yes, that sounds right. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is a way to compute its volume without knowing the coordinates. Let me write down the formula.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:

| 0    1     1     1     1  |
| 1    0   AB²  AC²  AD² |
| 1  AB²   0   BC²  BD² |
| 1  AC²  BC²   0   CD² |
| 1  AD²  BD²  CD²   0  |

And the volume V is sqrt( CM / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of this 5x5 matrix.

Wait, actually, the formula is V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where |CM| is the determinant. But I'm not entirely confident about the exact formula, so let me check.

Yes, the correct formula is:

288 * V² = |CM|

So, V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

Alright, let's assign the given edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) => AB² = 41
AC = sqrt(80) => AC² = 80
AD = sqrt(89) => AD² = 89
BC = sqrt(89) => BC² = 89
BD = sqrt(80) => BD² = 80
CD = sqrt(41) => CD² = 41

So, plug these into the Cayley-Menger determinant:

The determinant matrix is:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]
Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]
Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]
Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Wait, no, let me clarify. The first row and column are for the points, but the positions might be a bit different. Wait, no, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], and then the next rows correspond to each point with the squared distances to the other points. So, point A is the first point, then B, C, D.

So, the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD²
Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD²
Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD²
Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0

So substituting the values:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That's going to be a bit tedious, but maybe there's some symmetry I can exploit.

Let me denote the determinant as D. So,

D = | 0 1 1 1 1 |
    |1 0 41 80 89|
    |1 41 0 89 80|
    |1 80 89 0 41|
    |1 89 80 41 0 |

Calculating a 5x5 determinant manually is really error-prone, but perhaps I can use some properties or row operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, maybe since the tetrahedron is isosceles, there
