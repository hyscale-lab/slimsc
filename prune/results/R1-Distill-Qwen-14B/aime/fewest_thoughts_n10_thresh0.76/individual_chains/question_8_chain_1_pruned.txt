Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I know that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and sums of their products, sometimes it's helpful to consider symmetric expressions or try to factor them in some way. Let me see if I can express the second equation in terms of a + b + c or something similar.

The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me factor this. Each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. So, maybe I can factor it as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Let's check:

a²(b + c) = a²b + a²c
b²(a + c) = b²a + b²c
c²(a + b) = c²a + c²b

Yes, that adds up to the given expression. So, the second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let's substitute these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

a² * 300 - a³ + b² * 300 - b³ + c² * 300 - c³ = 6,000,000.

Factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can find another equation involving these terms using the known sum a + b + c.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, given a + b + c = 300, let's compute that:

300² = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + ac + bc)
90,000 = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + ac + bc).

So, if I can find ab + ac + bc, I can find a² + b² + c². Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + ac + bc, and Q = a² + b² + c².

From the above, Q = S² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

Now, let's go back to the equation I had earlier:

300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I need to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, P, or Q. I remember a formula for a³ + b³ + c³:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Substituting S, P, and Q,

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3abc = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3abc.

300³ is 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.

Now, plugging this into the earlier equation:

300Q - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

300Q - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Now, substitute Q with 90,000 - 2P:

300*(90,000 - 2P) - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Compute 300*(90,000 - 2P):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2P) = -600P.

So, the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify terms:

27,000,000 cancels with -27,000,000.

-600P + 900P = 300P.

So,

300P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me divide both sides by 3 to make it simpler:

100P - abc = 2,000,000.

So,

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now, I have expressions for Q, a³ + b³ + c³, and abc in terms of P.

But I'm not sure yet how to proceed. Maybe I can find another equation involving P.

Wait, since S = a + b + c = 300, Q = 90,000 - 2P, and I have abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

I think perhaps I can use these to find possible values for P, and then find the possible triples (a, b, c). But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can think of a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. If a, b, c are roots of x³ - Sx² + Px - abc = 0, which would be x³ - 300x² + Px - abc = 0.

From above, abc = 100P - 2,000,000. So, substituting:

x³ - 300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor out P:

x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000 + P(x - 100) = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, let's think
