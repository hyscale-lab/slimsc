Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, that's interesting. I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns. So, from the lower left corner (let's say point (0,0)) to the upper right corner (point (8,8)), the path must move right and up. Each step can be either right or up, but the total number of steps is 16 because to get from (0,0) to (8,8), you need 8 right steps and 8 up steps. 

Wait, but how does changing direction exactly four times factor into this? Let me think. Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, if the path changes direction four times, how many segments does it have? Well, each direction change adds a new segment. So, if you start in one direction, each direction change adds another segment. So, four direction changes would result in five segments. 

Let me confirm that. For example, if a path starts moving right, then changes direction to up, then back to right, then up, then right, that's three direction changes, making four segments. Yeah, so four direction changes would give five segments. So, the path is made up of five straight line segments, alternating between right and up.

So, the path alternates between right and up moves. Now, the key is that these segments must be of varying lengths. Each segment has to be at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero steps. So, each segment is at least length 1.

Since the path is made of five segments, and each segment alternates between right and up, let's say the first segment is right, then up, then right, then up, then right, or some other combination depending on how it starts. Wait, but since the grid is 8x8, the number of right steps and up steps must both be 8. So, the sum of the lengths of the right segments must equal 8, and the sum of the lengths of the up segments must equal 8.

So, let me model this. Let's say the path starts with a right segment, then up, then right, then up, then right. So, it's R, U, R, U, R. Each R segment adds to the total right steps, and each U segment adds to the total up steps. Similarly, if it starts with U, then R, etc., but since the grid is square, the starting direction might not matter, but let me check.

Wait, actually, the starting direction must be either right or up, but since the grid is symmetric, the number of paths starting with right and the number starting with up should be the same. So, maybe I can compute one and double it? Or maybe not, because the direction changes might affect it differently. Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a problem of composing the number 8 into a certain number of parts, considering the alternation
