Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says that a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is that 81 is 13-beautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

My task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers are b-eautiful, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Alright, let me break this down. To start, I should express n in base b as a two-digit number. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are the digits. Importantly, d1 must be between 1 and b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and d0 must be between 0 and b-1.

So, n can be written as n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is s = d1 + d0, and according to the problem, s must equal sqrt(n). Therefore, sqrt(n) = s, which implies that n = s^2.

Putting these together: d1 * b + d0 = s^2, and s = d1 + d0. So substituting s into the first equation, we get:

d1 * b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2.

Let me rewrite this equation:

d1 * b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2

Let me rearrange the terms:

(d1 + d0)^2 - d1 * b - d0 = 0

Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of s (since s = d1 + d0):

s^2 - d1 * b - d0 = 0

But since s = d1 + d0, perhaps I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can express d0 in terms of d1 and s. Since d0 = s - d1, substituting back into the first equation:

d1 * b + (s - d1) = s^2

Simplify:

d1 * b + s - d1 = s^2

Factor out d1:

d1 (b - 1) + s = s^2

Then, rearranged:

d1 (b - 1) = s^2 - s

So,

d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Hmm, that looks interesting. Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, d0 = s - d1, so d0 must be between 0 and b-1. 

So, for a given base b, to find all possible s, d1, and d0, I need to find s such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then d1 must be an integer in [1, b-1], and d0 = s - d1 must also be in [0, b-1].

Wait, but for each base b, s can vary. So perhaps for each b, I can iterate over possible s values and check the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe I can rephrase the equation:

From n = d1*b + d0 = s^2, and s = d1 + d0.

So, substituting n = s² into the first equation, we get:

d1*b + d0 = s²

But since d0 = s - d1, substituting:

d1*b + s - d1 = s²

Which simplifies to:

d1*(b - 1) = s² - s

So, d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be a positive integer (as it's a digit in base b, so 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1), (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer in [1, b-1].

So, for each b, we can consider possible s values and see if (s² - s) is divisible by (b - 1). Then, the quotient (d1) must be in [1, b-1], and d0 = s - d1 must be in [0, b-1].

Wait, but s is the sum of the digits, so s = d1 + d0. Since d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, s is at least 1. Also, since d1 is at most b-1 and d0 is at most b-1, s is at most 2*(b-1). So s can range from 1 to 2*(b-1). But since d0 can be up to b-1, and d1 is up to b-1, the maximum s is 2b-2.

But wait, since n = s², n must be a two-digit number in base b. The maximum two-digit number in base b is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1. So s² must be less than or equal to b² -1. So s must be less than or equal to sqrt(b² -1) ≈ b.

But wait, s is at least 1 and at most 2b-2, but s² must be ≤ b² -1, so s must be ≤ b-1 (since (b)^2 = b² which is larger than b² -1). Therefore, s can be at most b-1.

So s ∈ [1, b-1].

So for each base b, s can range from 1 to b-1. For each s in this range, we can check if (s² - s) is divisible by (b-1), and if so,
