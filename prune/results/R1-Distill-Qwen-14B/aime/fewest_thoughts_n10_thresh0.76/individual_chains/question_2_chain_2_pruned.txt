Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out OC² where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the given points are O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, plotting these in my mind, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis, and B is a bit higher up on the y-axis, at sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So, AB is a line segment connecting these two points.

The family of segments F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ has P somewhere on the x-axis, Q somewhere on the y-axis, and the distance between them is 1. So, for example, if P is at (a, 0), then Q must be at (0, b) such that the distance between (a,0) and (0,b) is 1. That means sqrt(a² + b²) = 1, so a² + b² = 1.

So, each PQ is a line segment from (a, 0) to (0, b) where a² + b² = 1. That's a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, but only in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem says there is a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, C is on AB, and only AB from the family F passes through C. All other segments in F do not pass through C.

Our goal is to find OC², where O is the origin, and express it as a fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Alright, so I need to find point C on AB such that only the segment AB passes through it among all possible segments in F.

First, let me figure out the equation of line AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the slope is -sqrt(3).

Using point-slope form, the equation of AB can be written as y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). Alternatively, I can write it as sqrt(3)x + y = sqrt(3)/2.

Now, any point on AB can be parametrized. Let me parameterize AB. Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1, where t=0 is at A and t=1 is at B.

So, the parametric equations would be x = (1/2) - (1/2)t, and y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t. So,

x = (1 - t)/2,

y = (sqrt(3)/2) t.

So, any point C on AB can be written as ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, the idea is that C is on AB and not on any other segment PQ in F except for AB itself. So, for C, there is exactly one segment PQ in F passing through it, which is AB. So, for all other PQ segments in F, they shouldn't pass through C.

So, for C, we need to ensure that there's no other PQ from F that passes through it. So, if we take C's coordinates, ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t ), then for any other PQ in F, this point shouldn't lie on PQ.

But how do we ensure that? Let me think.

Each PQ is a segment from (a, 0) to (0, b) with a² + b² = 1. So, the equation of PQ is x/a + y/b = 1.

So, for a point (x, y) to lie on PQ, it must satisfy x/a + y/b = 1.

But since a² + b² = 1, we can parametrize each PQ by a single parameter, say a, then b = sqrt(1 - a²), since in the first quadrant, b is positive.

So, the equation becomes x/a + y/sqrt(1 - a²) = 1.

Now, we can substitute C's coordinates into this equation:

[ (1 - t)/2 ] / a + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ] / sqrt(1 - a²) = 1.

This equation must hold for exactly one value of a, which is the one corresponding to AB. But for all other a, this equation shouldn't hold. So, for C to not lie on any other PQ, the equation above should have exactly one solution for a, which is when PQ is AB.

Wait, but AB is part of the family F? Let me check: AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is a segment in F.

So, for point C, the equation [ (1 - t)/2 ] / a + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ] / sqrt(1 - a²) = 1 must have exactly one solution for a, which is the specific a that gives AB.

So, if I can find t such that this equation has exactly one solution a, then C is that point.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the equation has exactly one solution for a, which would correspond to AB.

So, if I write the equation as:

( (1 - t)/2 ) / a + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / sqrt(1 - a²) = 1.

Let me denote (1 - t)/2 as A, and
