Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, ω is a complex number on the unit circle, right? It's e^(2πi/13) or something like that.

The expression I need to compute is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That seems a bit complicated, but maybe there's a way to simplify it. I remember that products over roots of unity often relate to cyclotomic polynomials or something like that. Maybe I can express each term in the product in a more manageable form.

Let me look at each factor: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, can I factor this? Let's see. Let me treat ω^k as a variable, say x. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². Let's see if that quadratic factors. The discriminant is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over complex numbers? Or perhaps another approach.

Wait, maybe I can write it differently. Let me see: 2 - 2x + x² = x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, maybe complete the square? Let's try: x² - 2x + 1 +1 = (x - 1)^2 + 1. So, 2 - 2x + x² = (x - 1)^2 + 1. Interesting. So each term is (x - 1)^2 + 1, where x = ω^k.

So, substituting back, each term is (ω^k - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, so the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of [(ω^k - 1)^2 + 1]. 

Wait, maybe I can relate this to a polynomial whose roots are ω^k. Because the product over (x - ω^k) is the minimal polynomial for ω, which is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. But here, each term is a quadratic in ω^k, so perhaps I can relate the entire product to some cyclotomic polynomial.

Alternatively, maybe I can pair terms or find symmetries. Since ω is a root of unity, ω^k for k=0,...,12 are all the 13th roots of unity except 1, but wait, when k=0, ω
