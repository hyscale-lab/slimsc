Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that after coloring, the octagon can be rotated so that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability, so each has a 1/2 chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's the denominator for my probability.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out the numerator: the number of colorings where there's a rotation that maps all blue vertices to red positions. Wait, does that mean that after some rotation, the set of blue vertices becomes exactly the set of red vertices? Or is it that each blue vertex is moved to a position that was originally red? Hmm, I think it's the latter. So, for each blue vertex, after rotation, it should land on a position that was previously red. So, the set of blue vertices should be a rotation of the set of red vertices.

But wait, in a regular octagon, rotations are cyclic, so the set of red and blue vertices must form orbits under rotation. Oh, but the octagon is regular, so it's symmetric under rotations by multiples of 45 degrees, right? So, the group of rotations is cyclic of order 8.

So, for a coloring to satisfy the condition, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. That is, the blue vertices must form a rotationally symmetric set that, when rotated by some multiple of 45 degrees, aligns with the red vertices.

But wait, since the octagon is regular, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the blue set must be a rotation of the red set by some angle. But since the octagon is regular, if the red set is fixed, then the blue set must be a rotated version of the red set. So, in other words, the blue set must be equal to the red set rotated by some k positions, where k is from 0 to 7.

But in that case, the blue set is a rotation of the red set, meaning that the coloring is such that the blue and red sets are rotations of each other.

Wait, but the octagon has rotational symmetry, so for each coloring, if the blue and red sets are rotations of each other, then the coloring is symmetric in some way.

Wait, but how can we count the number of such colorings?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as: for a given coloring, if the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices, then the coloring must be such that the blue and red sets are equal under some rotation.

But how do we count the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to model the problem
