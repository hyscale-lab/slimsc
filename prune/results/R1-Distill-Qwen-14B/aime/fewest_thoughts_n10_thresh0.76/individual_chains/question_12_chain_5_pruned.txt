Okay, so I've got this math problem here about filling a 2x3 grid with digits, and there are some conditions on the sums. Let me try to wrap my head around this.

First, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. Each cell will have a digit from 0 to 9. The problem says that when we read the numbers left to right, each row forms a number, and the sum of these two numbers should be 999. Also, when we read the numbers top to bottom, each column forms a three-digit number (since each column has two digits, wait, noâ€”actually, each column has two digits, so maybe each column is a two-digit number? Hmm, the example given has a grid where the top row is 0,0,8 and the bottom is 9,9,1. When reading top to bottom, the columns are 09, 09, and 81. So each column is a two-digit number. The sum of these three numbers is 99.

Wait, let me check the example. The grid is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

So reading left to right, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991. Their sum is 8 + 991 = 999, which matches the condition.

Reading top to bottom, the first column is 0 and 9, so 09, which is 9. The second column is 0 and 9, so another 9. The third column is 8 and 1, which is 81. Adding these together: 9 + 9 + 81 = 99, which also matches.

So, the problem is: How many ways can we fill the grid such that the sum of the two row numbers is 999 and the sum of the three column numbers is 99?

Let me represent the grid with variables to make it clearer. Let's denote the grid as:

a b c
d e f

So the top row is abc (a three-digit number: 100a + 10b + c), and the bottom row is def (another three-digit number: 100d + 10e + f). So according to the condition, their sum should be 999:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Similarly, the columns are:

First column: ad (a two-digit number: 10a + d)
Second column: be (10b + e)
Third column: cf (10c + f)
So their sum is:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So we have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Our goal is to find the number of possible (a,b,c,d,e,f) tuples that satisfy both equations, where each letter is a digit (0-9).

Hmm, okay. Let me try to manipulate these equations to find some constraints.

First, let's write equation 1 as:

(100a + 100d) + (10b + 10e) + (c + f) = 999

Which can be written as:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly, equation 2 is:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Which can be written as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Wait, that might not help directly. Let me see if I can subtract or combine these equations.

Alternatively, let me denote S = a + d, T = b + e, U = c + f.

From equation 1:

100S + 10T + U = 999

From equation 2:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

But a + b + c is the sum of the top row digits, and d + e + f is the sum of the bottom row digits.

Alternatively, let's express equation 2 in terms of S, T, U.

Wait, S = a + d, T = b + e, U = c + f.

So equation 2 becomes:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Which is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But (a + b + c) is the sum of the top row digits, and (d + e + f) is the sum of the bottom row digits.

Alternatively, we can write equation 2 as:

10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let me denote P = a + b + c, Q = d + e + f.

Then equation 2 becomes 10P + Q = 99.

So Q = 9
