Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, alright, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, I think the cyclotomic polynomial for 13 is going to come into play here. Let me recall that the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that connects to the product given.

Looking at the product, each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. Let me write that as (2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2). So each term is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe there's a way to factor this or relate it to the cyclotomic polynomial.

Wait, but for each k, ω^k is another root of unity, since raising a root of unity to an integer power still gives a root of unity. So each term is of the form 2 - 2x + x² where x = ω^k.

Let me compute the quadratic 2 - 2x + x². Maybe I can factor it or relate it to something else. Let's see: x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, that doesn't factor over the integers, does it? The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are complex. But maybe if I think in terms of complex numbers, I can express it as something involving other roots of unity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this quadratic as a product of linear factors. Let's find its roots. The roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Interesting. So each term in the product is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Since multiplication is commutative, I can rearrange this as the product over k of (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over k of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

Now, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all primitive roots of (x - ω^k) is Φ_n(x). But in this case, ω is a primitive 13th root, so the product over all k from 0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x¹³ - 1. Because the roots of x¹³ - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity.

But wait, here I have products of (ω^k - a) for some a, not (x - ω^k). So perhaps if I let x = a, then the product becomes (a - ω^0)(a - ω^1)...(a - ω¹²) = a¹³ - 1. Because substituting x = a into the product gives x¹³ - 1, which is equal to the product.

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a¹³ - 1.

Therefore, in our case, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = product_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) * (-1)^{13} because each term is (ω^k - a) = -(a - ω^k). So, since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. So,

product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = (-1)^{13} * product_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) = -[(1 + i)^13 - 1].

Similarly, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω
