Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, let's list out what's given:

- Total residents: 900
- Number of residents who own a diamond ring: 195
- Number who own a set of golf clubs: 367
- Number who own a garden spade: 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's 900 people owning that.

Additionally, 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. We need to find how many own all four.

Hmm. So, four items in total: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Since every resident owns at least the candy hearts, that might simplify things a bit because C is universal. Wait, that's an important point. So C is present in everyone. So, when considering overlaps, do I need to include C in all the sets?

Wait, let me think again. So each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, if someone owns exactly two things, it could be any two of D, G, S, or C. But since C is always owned, owning exactly two things would mean they own C plus one other. Or maybe not? Wait, no. Because if someone owns exactly two, then C is one of them, right? Because they have to own C. So, the other thing they own would be one of D, G, or S. So for example, someone might own C and D, but not G or S. Similarly for the others.

Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things would have C plus two others. And those who own all four have all D, G, S, and C.

Hmm, okay. So, in this case, the problem is about inclusion-exclusion with four sets, where one set (C) is universal. That might make things a bit easier.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since everyone owns C, the size of C is 900, which is the total number of residents. So |C| = 900.

But also, since C is universal, any intersection involving C would just be the set of people who own the other items along with C. So, for example, D∩C is just D, because if you own D, you automatically own C. Similarly, G∩C is G, and S∩C is S.

Wait, that's a key insight. So, for example, D∩C is just D, because all D owners also have C. Similarly for G and S.

So that simplifies the inclusion-exclusion formula because all the pairwise intersections with C become just the individual sets. Let me try to rewrite the inclusion-exclusion formula with this in mind.

But first, since C is universal, the union of all four sets is just C, which is 900. Because everyone owns C, so the union can't be bigger than 900.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = 900.

So, putting it into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But since |D∩C| is |D|, |G∩C| is |G|, and |S∩C| is |S|, let's substitute those:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |D| + |G∩S| + |G| + |S|) + (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C|) - |D∩G∩S∩C|

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me try to organize it.

First, let me compute each part step by step.

Compute the sum of individual sets:

|D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.

Let me add these up:

195 + 367 = 562

562 + 562 = 1124

1124 + 900 = 2024

So the sum is 2024.

Next, subtract the pairwise intersections. But as we established, some of these intersections include C, which simplifies to just the individual sets.

Wait, but in the inclusion-exclusion formula, the pairwise intersections are all possible combinations. So, the pairwise intersections would be D∩G, D∩S, D∩C, G∩S, G∩C, S∩C.

But as we saw, D∩C = D, G∩C = G, S∩C = S.

So, the sum of pairwise intersections is |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |D| + |G∩S| + |G| + |S|.

But we don't know |D∩G| or |D∩S| or |G∩S|. So, let me denote:

Let’s denote:

a = |D∩G| (number who own both D and G)

b = |D∩S| (number who own both D and S)

c = |G∩S| (number who own both G and S)

So, the sum of pairwise intersections is a + b + c + |D| + |G| + |S|

We know |D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562.

So, sum of pairwise intersections = a + b + c + 195 + 367 + 562.

Let me compute 195 + 367 +562:

195 + 367 = 562

562 +562 = 1124

So, sum of pairwise intersections is a + b + c + 1124.

Now, moving on to the next part of inclusion-exclusion: adding back the triple intersections.

Triple intersections would be D∩G∩S, D∩G∩C, D∩S∩C, G∩S∩C.

Again, since C is universal, D∩G∩C is the same as D∩G, because owning D and G automatically includes owning C. Similarly, D∩G∩S would be the people who own all three D, G, S, and since they also have C, this is the same as D∩G∩S∩C.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the triple intersections are:

1. D∩G∩S
2. D∩G∩C
3. D∩S∩C
4. G∩S∩C

But since C is universal, any intersection with C is just the other sets. So, D∩G∩C is the same as D∩G. Similarly, D∩S∩C is D∩S, and G∩S∩C is G∩S. So, triple intersections that include C are just the pairwise intersections.

But wait, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, triple intersections that don't include C would be different. Hmm, but in this case, all the triple intersections would include C because the fourth set is C, which is universal.

Wait, no. The triple intersections are all possible combinations of three sets from D, G, S, C. So, for example, D∩G∩S is one, D∩G∩C is another, D∩S∩C, G∩S∩C, and also, the triple intersection of D∩G∩S∩C, but wait no, that's four sets.

Wait, no, the triple intersections are any three of the four sets. So, the triple intersections are D∩G∩S, D∩G∩C, D∩S∩C, G∩S∩C.

Since C is universal, any intersection involving C with other sets is just the set of people who own those other sets. So, D∩G∩C is D∩G, D∩S∩C is D∩S, etc.

But in the inclusion-exclusion formula, these are being added back. So, in the formula, we have:

+ |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C|

Which becomes:

+ |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|

Because D∩G∩C = D∩G, etc.

Wait, but then the triple intersections are including the same terms as the pairwise intersections.

Wait, that can't be right. Am I getting this wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

In our case, the four sets are D, G, S, and C, with C being universal.

So, in this formula, the triple intersections include all combinations of three sets, including those that include C.

But since C is universal, any intersection involving C is just the intersection of the other two sets. So, for example:

- |D∩G∩C| = |D∩G|
- |D∩S∩C| = |D∩S|
- |G∩S∩C| = |G∩S|
- |D∩G∩S∩C| is the intersection of all four, which is the same as |D∩G∩S| since C is universal.

But wait, no. Wait, if C is universal, then D∩G∩S∩C is the same as D∩G∩S. Because everyone has C, so adding C to the intersection doesn't change it.

So, perhaps I can represent this as:

The triple intersections (A∩B∩C, etc.) become equivalent to A∩B, since C is universal.

Wait, but let's clarify.

Let me denote the four sets as A (D), B (G), C (S), and U (C). So U is the universal set (candy hearts).

So, the inclusion-exclusion formula becomes:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ U| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |U| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩U| - |B∩C| - |B∩U| - |C∩U| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩U| + |A∩C∩U| + |B∩C∩U| - |A∩B∩C∩U|

But since U is universal, A∩U = A, B∩U = B, C∩U = C, and A∩B∩U = A∩B, etc.

So substituting:

= |A| + |B| + |C| + |U| - (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A| + |B∩C| + |B| + |C|) + (|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) - |A∩B∩C|

Hmm, that seems complicated, but let me try to simplify term by term.

First, let me write it out:

= |A| + |B| + |C| + |U| 
- (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A| + |B∩C| + |B| + |C|)
+ (|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|)
- |A∩B∩C|

Now, let's substitute |U| = 900.

Let me also collect like terms.

Expand all terms:

= |A| + |B| + |C| + 900
- |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A| - |B∩C| - |B| - |C|
+ |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|
- |A∩B∩C|

Now, let's cancel terms where possible.

Looking at the terms:

- The +|A| and -|A| cancel.

- Similarly, +|B| and -|B| cancel.

- +|C| and -|C| cancel.

Now, for the intersections:

- The -|A∩B| and +|A∩B| cancel.

- Similarly, -|A∩C| and +|A∩C| cancel.

- -|B∩C| and +|B∩C| cancel.

Now, what's left?

We have:

900 + |A∩B∩C| - |A∩B∩C|

Because the last term is -|A∩B∩C|.

So, 900 + |A∩B∩C| - |A∩B∩C| = 900.

Which makes sense because the union is equal to U, which is 900.

So, this shows that with U being universal, the inclusion-exclusion formula simplifies to 900, as expected.

But how does this help us find the number of people who own all four, which is |A∩B∩C∩U| = |A∩B∩C| since U is universal.

Wait, so |A∩B∩C∩U| = |A∩B∩C|.

So, the problem is asking for the number of residents who own all four things, which is |A∩B∩C| = x (let's say x is the number we're looking for).

But from the inclusion-exclusion, we see that all the terms involving intersections cancel out, leaving us with 900.

Hmm, but that doesn't directly give us x. So, perhaps we need another approach.

Let me think about the given data again.

We know that 437 residents own exactly two of the things, and 234 own exactly three.

Wait, but since C is universal, owning exactly two things would mean owning two of D, G, S, and C. But since they must have C, owning exactly two would mean they have C plus one other. So, for example, C and D, but not G or S.

Similarly, owning exactly three would mean they have C plus two others. So, for example, C, D, and G, but not S.

And owning all four would mean C plus D, G, and S.

So, the problem gives us the number of people owning exactly two or exactly three, but not all four.

Wait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we're to find those who own all four (exactly four).

But wait, can someone own exactly four? Since C is universal, if someone owns all three other items, they automatically have C, so they would be owning all four. So, the number of people owning exactly four is the same as those who own all three of D, G, and S.

Wait, but the problem states that 234 own exactly three. Wait, but in this context, does "exactly three" include C or not?

Wait, that's a crucial point. The problem states that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, when it says "exactly two", that would include the candy hearts. So, someone who owns exactly two would have C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would have C plus two others, and exactly four would have all four.

But wait, in the problem statement, the 437 own exactly two of these things. Are these the number of people who own exactly two, regardless of whether they include C?

Wait, no, because C is a given for everyone. So, when someone owns exactly two things, they must include C and one other. So, the two things are C and, say, D.

Similarly, someone owning exactly three things would have C plus two others, like C, D, and G.

So, the counts for exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four are as follows:

- Exactly two: C plus one other. So, the number of people owning exactly two is 437.

- Exactly three: C plus two others. So, 234 people.

- Exactly four: C plus all three others. So, the number we're looking for, let's call it x.

But wait, the problem also says that 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we're to find those owning all four.

But we also have the counts for each individual item:

- D: 195
- G: 367
- S: 562
- C: 900

So, the total number of people owning each item can be broken down into those who own only that item plus those who own it along with others.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion with the given numbers.

Alternatively, since C is universal, let's consider the other three items: D, G, S.

Let me think of it as each resident owns C plus some subset of D, G, S.

So, the problem reduces to: each resident owns C and some combination of D, G, S.

So, the number of people owning exactly two of the four items is the number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S in addition to C. Because exactly two would mean C plus one other.

Similarly, exactly three would mean C plus two others, and exactly four would mean C plus all three.

So, let me denote:

- a: number of people owning exactly two items: so, C plus one of D, G, S.

- b: number of people owning exactly three items: C plus two of D, G, S.

- c: number of people owning exactly four items: C plus all three of D, G, S.

But according to the problem, a = 437, b = 234, and c is what we're trying to find.

Now, we can also compute the total number of people owning each of D, G, S.

Let me compute for D:

The number of people owning D is 195. This can be broken down into:

- Those who own only D and C: let's call this number d.

- Those who own D and G and C: let's call this e.

- Those who own D and S and C: f.

- Those who own D, G, S, and C: c.

So, |D| = d + e + f + c = 195.

Similarly, for G:

|G| = e + f + g + c = 367.

Wait, wait, maybe I should better define these variables.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the total number of people owning D as the sum of those who own only D and C, those who own D and G and C, those who own D and S and C, and those who own all four.

Similarly for G and S.

But perhaps an alternative approach is to think in terms of the number of people owning each of D, G, S, considering that they may own one, two, or all three along with C.

So, the total number of people owning D is equal to the number of people who have D and exactly one other (C), plus those who have D and exactly two others (C and another), plus those who have all three (C, D, G, S).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

Each person who owns D must have C, so the number of D owners is the number of people who own D and exactly one other (C) plus those who own D and exactly two others (C and another item) plus those who own D and all three others (C, G, S).

So, |D| = (number with D and C only) + (number with D, C, and G) + (number with D, C, and S) + (number with D, C, G, and S).

Similarly for G and S.

But perhaps we can find the total number of people owning each item in terms of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.

Let me denote:

- Let x be the number of people owning all four (C, D, G, S).

- Let y be the number of people owning exactly three (C, D, G; C, D, S; or C, G, S).

Wait, but the problem says that exactly three is 234, so y = 234.

- Let z be the number of people owning exactly two (C plus one other).

Wait, no, wait: the problem states that exactly two is 437, so z = 437.

Wait, but each of these exactly two, three, and four includes all combinations.

But perhaps I can model the total number of people owning each item.

For example, the number of people owning D is equal to the number of people who own D and exactly one other (C), plus those who own D and exactly two others (C and another), plus those who own D and all three others.

So, |D| = a + b + x, where:

- a is the number of people owning exactly two items (C and D).

- b is the number of people owning exactly three items that include D (C, D, G; C, D, S).

- x is the number of people owning all four.

Similarly for G and S.

So, let me write equations for each of D, G, S.

For D:

a + b + x = 195

For G:

c + d + x = 367

For S:

e + f + x = 562

But I need to figure out what a, b, c, d, e, f are.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the sum of all a, b, c, d, e, f.

Wait, the total number of people who own exactly two is 437, which includes all combinations of C plus one other.

The possible exactly two ownerships are:

- C and D

- C and G

- C and S

So, the number of people owning exactly two is the sum of the number of people owning each of these three pairs.

So, let me denote:

Let a = number owning C and D only.

b = number owning C and G only.

c = number owning C and S only.

So, a + b + c = 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three is 234, which includes:

- C, D, G

- C, D, S

- C, G, S

Let me denote:

d = number owning C, D, G only.

e = number owning C, D, S only.

f = number owning C, G, S only.

So, d + e + f = 234.

And the number of people owning all four is x.

Now, let's express the total number of owners for each item.

For D:

Owners of D include:

- a (C and D only)

- d (C, D, G)

- e (C, D, S)

- x (all four)

So, a + d + e + x = 195.

Similarly for G:

b (C and G only) + d (C, D, G) + f (C, G, S) + x = 367.

For S:

c (C and S only) + e (C, D, S) + f (C, G, S) + x = 562.

Now, we have a system of equations.

Equation 1: a + d + e + x = 195.

Equation 2: b + d + f + x = 367.

Equation 3: c + e + f + x = 562.

We also know:

Equation 4: a + b + c = 437.

Equation 5: d + e + f = 234.

We need to find x.

Now, let's see if we can add Equations 1, 2, and 3 together.

Adding them:

(a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) = 195 + 367 + 562.

Simplify the left side:

a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x.

Because:

- a + b + c from the first terms.

- d appears twice: once in equation 1 and once in equation 2.

Similarly, e appears in equation 1 and 3.

f appears in equation 2 and 3.

And x appears three times.

So left side: a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x.

Right side: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, 195 + 367 = 562, plus 562 is 1124.

So, equation 6: a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x = 1124.

Now, from equation 4: a + b + c = 437.

From equation 5: d + e + f = 234.

So, substituting into equation 6:

437 + 2*(234) + 3x = 1124.

Compute 2*234: 468.

So,

437 + 468 + 3x = 1124.

437 + 468 = 905.

So,

905 + 3x = 1124.

Subtract 905 from both sides:

3x = 1124 - 905 = 219.

So, x = 219 / 3 = 73.

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data about the residents of Aimeville. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the Variables**:
   - Total residents: 900.
   - Residents owning diamond ring (D): 195.
   - Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367.
   - Residents owning garden spade (S): 562.
   - Everyone owns candy hearts (C), so |C| = 900.
   - Residents owning exactly two items: 437.
   - Residents owning exactly three items: 234.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of residents owning all four items.

2. **Breakdown of Ownership**:
   - Residents owning exactly two items (C + one other) sum to 437.
   - Residents owning exactly three items (C + two others) sum to 234.
   - Residents owning all four items (C + D + G + S) is \( x \).

3. **Formulate Equations**:
   - For D: \( a + d + e + x = 195 \), where \( a \) owns C and D only, \( d \) owns C, D, G only, \( e \) owns C, D, S only.
   - For G: \( b + d + f + x = 367 \), where \( b \) owns C and G only, \( f \) owns C, G, S only.
   - For S: \( c + e + f + x = 562 \), where \( c \) owns C and S only.
   - Total exactly two: \( a + b + c = 437 \).
   - Total exactly three: \( d + e + f = 234 \).

4. **Combine the Equations**:
   - Adding the equations for D, G, and S gives:
     \[
     a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x = 1124.
     \]
   - Substitute \( a + b + c = 437 \) and \( d + e + f = 234 \):
     \[
     437 + 2(234) + 3x = 1124.
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     437 + 468 + 3x = 1124 \implies 905 + 3x = 1124 \implies 3x = 219 \implies x = 73.
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   The number of residents who own all four items is **73**.

\boxed{73}
