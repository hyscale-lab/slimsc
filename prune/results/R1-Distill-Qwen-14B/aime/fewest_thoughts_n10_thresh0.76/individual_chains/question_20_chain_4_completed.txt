Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white and 25 black chips, but they're indistinct, so the color matters but not which specific chip. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, all chips in the same column must be the same color, and that any additional chip would violate these conditions.

Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, each row must have all chips of the same color. So for each row, I can choose either white or black. Similarly, each column must be all white or all black. But wait, if all the rows are white, then the entire grid is white. But then, the condition says that we can't place any more chips, but if all cells are already filled, then each cell has a chip, but the count is 25 white and 25 black. Wait, no, that can't happen because a 5x5 grid has 25 cells, so if all are white, we have 25 white chips used, but the problem allows up to 25 white and 25 black. So maybe the grid can't be completely filled because that would require 25 chips, but since we have two colors, it's possible to have some rows or columns as white or black.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Each row and each column must be entirely one color. So each row is either all white or all black, and each column is either all white or all black. But that creates a situation where the color assignments for rows and columns have to be consistent.

Wait, if a row is white, does it mean that all the cells in that row are white chips, and similarly for black. But then, if a column is white, all the cells in that column must be white, but if a row is white, all the cells in that row are white. So the color assignments for rows and columns must agree where they intersect.

Wait a minute, this seems like a problem where each row and each column is assigned a color, but the color assignments must be consistent in the grid. Because if a row is white and a column is black, then their intersection would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So that can't happen. Therefore, the color assignments for the rows and columns must be such that wherever a row and column intersect, their colors agree.

Wait, but how can this be? Let's model this. Suppose I assign a color to each row and a color to each column. Then, for each cell (i,j), the color must be the same as the color of row i and the color of column j. So, if row i is white and column j is black, that cell would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, in order to avoid that, the assignments of row and column colors must be such that all the row colors and column colors agree in some way.

Wait, maybe all row colors and column colors must be the same? Because if some row is white and some column is black, then their intersection would be a problem. So perhaps all the rows must be the same color, say white, and all the columns must be the same color, say black, but that can't happen because then all the cells would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, perhaps all the rows and columns must be assigned colors in a way that for each cell (i,j), the row i's color and column j's color are the same.

Wait, but how can that be? Let me think of it as a matrix where each cell's color is determined by both its row and column. So, maybe all rows are white and all columns are white, so the grid is entirely white. Or all rows are black and all columns are black, so grid is entirely black. But that's the extreme case. Alternatively, perhaps some rows are white, others are black, and similarly for columns, but arranged in a way that no row and column have conflicting colors.

Wait, maybe this is possible only if all the rows are assigned the same color as the columns in some way. Let me see. Let me think of each row being either white or black, and each column being either white or black, but ensuring that for every cell (i,j), the row i's color equals the column j's color. So, the colors for rows and columns must be consistent across the entire grid.

Wait, but how? Let me think of it as a bipartite graph where rows are one set and columns are another, and edges represent cells. Each edge must be assigned a color, but in such a way that all edges connected to a row have the same color, and all edges connected to a column have the same color. So, that's equivalent to the rows and columns being assigned colors such that every edge (cell) has the same color as its row and column. So, this can only happen if all the row colors are the same, and all the column colors are the same, but that would require that if any row is white, all columns must also be white, and vice versa. Or maybe if some rows are white and others black, but then the columns would have to align with that.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if I have a row colored white and another row colored black, then the columns intersecting these rows would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possible assignments are when all rows have the same color and all columns have the same color as the rows. So, either all rows and columns are white, or all are black.

Wait, but that can't be right because then the grid would be either all white or all black. But then, the number of such grids would be two (all white or all black), but I feel like that's not the case because the problem mentions placing some of the chips, which suggests that not all cells are filled.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it.

The problem says: "each cell contains at most one chip." So, some cells can be empty. Then, "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So, any chips in a row must be the same color, same for columns. Also, "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions." So the placement is maximal: you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column color conditions.

Wait, so perhaps the grid is partially filled, with some rows or columns being all white or all black, but in such a way that any additional chip would cause a conflict in either row or column.

Wait, perhaps the grid is such that each row is either all white or all black, and each column is either all white or all black, but not necessarily all rows being the same or all columns being the same. But if a row is white and a column is black, then their intersection cell can't have a chip because it would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, the placement must be such that all the filled cells are in rows and columns that agree in color.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that for any filled cell at (i,j), row i and column j must have the same color. So, if row i is white, then column j must be white, or if row i is black, column j must be black.

Wait, that's an interesting thought. So, let's model this. Suppose I have a subset of rows assigned white and others black, and a subset of columns assigned white and others black, such that for any cell (i,j) that is filled, the color of row i must be equal to the color of column j. So, if I have a white row and a white column, their intersection can be filled with a white chip. Similarly, a black row and black column can be filled with a black chip. But a white row and a black column cannot have any chips because their colors don't match.

So, in this model, the filled cells are exactly the intersections of same-colored rows and columns. So, if I have W rows colored white and B rows colored black (W + B =5), and Wc columns colored white and Bc columns colored black (Wc + Bc=5), then the number of filled cells would be W*Wc (for white intersections) and B*Bc (for black intersections).

But wait, because each white row can only be placed in white columns, and black rows in black columns. So, the total filled cells is W*Wc + B*Bc, where W + B =5, Wc + Bc=5.

But the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip, but the color is determined by the row and column. So, each filled cell is either white or black, depending on whether its row and column are white or black.

Wait, but in this case, each filled white cell is in a white row and a white column, so all the white chips are in those cells. Similarly for black.

But wait, the chips are indistinct except for color. So, the number of white chips used would be W*Wc, and the number of black chips would be B*Bc.

But the problem allows up to 25 white and 25 black chips, but in this case, the number of white chips used is W*Wc, which can be at most 25, same for black.

But the problem also says that the placement is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column color constraints.

So, for each row, if it's white, then all the columns that it's connected to must also be white, otherwise, you can't place any more chips in that row or column.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If a row is white, then any column that intersects it must also be white in order for that cell to be filled. But if the column isn't white, then that cell can't have a chip. So, perhaps the assignment of row colors and column colors determines which cells can be filled.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement must be such that all the white-filled cells are in a rectangle (possibly the entire grid) where all those rows are white and columns are white, and the black-filled cells are in a rectangle where all those rows are black and columns are black. But in this case, the grid is divided into four quadrants: white rows and white columns, white rows and black columns, black rows and white columns, and black rows and black columns. But only the white-white and black-black intersections can have chips.

Wait, but that's only possible if the white rows and black rows are completely separate from the white columns and black columns. Wait, perhaps not. Let me consider an example.

Suppose I have W white rows and Wc white columns. Then, the cells where white rows and white columns intersect can have white chips. Similarly, B black rows and Bc black columns can have black chips. But the cells where white rows meet black columns and black rows meet white columns cannot have any chips because their colors would conflict.

So, the total number of white chips is W*Wc, and black chips is B*Bc. Since W + B = 5 and Wc + Bc =5, the maximum number of chips is W*Wc + B*Bc.

But the problem says that the placement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips. That would mean that for any cell not filled, adding a chip there would violate the row or column color condition.

So, for any empty cell (i,j), either row i is already assigned a color that conflicts with column j's color, or the row or column can't accept another chip of that color without violating the same-color condition.

Wait, but if a row is white, then all the cells in that row must be white. So, if any cell in that row is not filled, it's because the column of that cell is black. But then, since the row is white, and the column is black, the cell can't be filled. So, the placement is such that all white rows are filled only in white columns, and all black rows are filled only in black columns.

Moreover, any cell not filled implies that either its row is white and the column is black, or the row is black and the column is white. So, the placement is determined by the choice of white rows and white columns.

Wait, perhaps the number of such configurations is the number of ways to choose subsets of rows and columns such that the white rows and white columns form a rectangle where the grid is filled with white chips, and similarly for black rows and black columns.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's model this as selecting some white rows and some white columns, and then the intersection of white rows and white columns forms a white rectangle. Similarly, the remaining rows (black) and remaining columns (black) form a black rectangle. The cells in white-black and black-white intersections are empty.

So, the total number of white chips is W * Wc, and black chips is B * Bc, where W is the number of white rows, Wc the number of white columns, B =5 - W, Bc=5 - Wc.

But we also have the constraints that the number of white chips cannot exceed 25, but since W and Wc can be at most 5 each, W*Wc can be up to 25, so that's fine. Similarly for black chips.

But the problem requires that the placement is maximal, meaning that no more chips can be added. So, for any empty cell, adding a chip would violate the row or column condition. So, for any empty cell (i,j), either row i is white and column j is black, or row i is black and column j is white.

Wait, that makes sense because if row i is white, then any chip in that row must be white, but if column j is black, then any chip in that column must be black. So, cell (i,j) can't be both white and black, hence it's empty. So, the placement is such that the white rows and white columns are completely filled, and the black rows and black columns are completely filled. The other cells are empty.

Wait, but that would mean that for any white row and white column, their intersection is filled with a white chip. Similarly, for any black row and black column, their intersection is filled with a black chip. And the other cells are empty.

So, the problem reduces to choosing a subset of white rows (W) and white columns (Wc), such that the number of white chips is W * Wc, and the number of black chips is (5 - W) * (5 - Wc). Additionally, the total number of chips is W * Wc + (5 - W) * (5 - Wc), which must be <=25 +25=50, but since each cell can have at most one chip, the maximum is 25, but wait, no, because some cells can be white and others black, as long as their row and column colors match.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let's think of it as a bipartition of the grid into four blocks:

1. White rows and white columns: filled with white chips.
2. White rows and black columns: empty.
3. Black rows and white columns: empty.
4. Black rows and black columns: filled with black chips.

So, the total number of white chips is W * Wc, and black chips is (5 - W) * (5 - Wc). Since W can range from 0 to 5 and Wc can range from 0 to 5.

But the problem states that each cell can have at most one chip, which is already handled because each cell is either white, black, or empty.

Now, the condition that the placement is maximal implies that no more chips can be added. So, for any cell not in the white rectangle or the black rectangle, adding a chip would require that row and column to have the same color, but since the row and column are of conflicting colors, you can't add any more chips there.

Wait, no, because if a cell is in a white row and a black column, adding a chip there would require that all chips in that row are white, which they are, but all chips in that column would have to be black, which they are. Wait, but the cell is in a white row and a black column, so the chip would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, such cells can't have any chips, which means that the placement is maximal because you can't add any more chips without violating the color conditions.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is the number of ways to choose W white rows and Wc white columns, where W can be from 0 to 5 and Wc can be from 0 to 5, but with the constraint that the placement is maximal.

Wait, but in our earlier model, the placement is determined entirely by W and Wc, so each pair (W, Wc) defines a unique configuration.

But wait, the problem also states that "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions." So, we must ensure that no more chips can be added. In our model, that's automatically satisfied because any empty cell is either in a white row and a black column or a black row and a white column, both of which can't have any chips without causing a color conflict.

Therefore, the number of valid configurations is the number of possible pairs (W, Wc), where W is the number of white rows (0 ≤ W ≤5) and Wc is the number of white columns (0 ≤ Wc ≤5). But wait, no, because for each W and Wc, the black rows and black columns are determined as B =5 - W and Bc =5 - Wc.

But wait, there's a problem here. Because if we choose W and Wc, the number of white chips is W*Wc, and the number of black chips is B*Bc = (5 - W)(5 - Wc). The total number of chips is W*Wc + (5 - W)(5 - Wc), which must be <=25 since each cell can have at most one chip.

Wait, but W*Wc + (5 - W)(5 - Wc) = W*Wc + (25 -5W -5Wc + W Wc) ) = 25 -5W -5Wc + 2W Wc.

Wait, but this must be less than or equal to 25. So, 25 -5W -5Wc +2W Wc ≤25.

Which simplifies to -5W -5Wc + 2W Wc ≤0.

So, 2W Wc ≤5W +5Wc.

Hmm, but for W and Wc in 0 to5, let's see.

For example, when W=0, Wc can be 0 to5. Then 2*0*Wc =0 ≤5*0 +5 Wc → 0 ≤5 Wc, which is true.

Similarly, when W=5, Wc can be 0 to5. 2*5*Wc ≤0 +5 Wc →10 Wc ≤5 Wc → which implies 10 Wc ≤5 Wc → 5 Wc ≤0, which is only possible when Wc=0. But wait, when W=5, Wc must be 0, because 10 Wc ≤5 Wc → 5 Wc ≤0 → Wc=0.

Wait, this suggests that when W=5, Wc must be 0, because otherwise, the inequality isn't satisfied. So, let's check some values.

Wait, let me consider W=3 and Wc=3. Then 2*3*3=18 ≤5*3 +5*3=30 →18 ≤30, which is true.

But when W=5, Wc=5: 2*5*5=50 ≤5*5 +5*5=50 →50 ≤50, which holds. But when W=5 and Wc=5, the number of white chips is 5*5=25, and black chips is 0*0=0, so total is 25, which is within the limit.

Wait, but earlier when I thought W=5 requires Wc=0, that's not correct. Because when W=5 and Wc=5, the number of white chips is 25, which is allowed, and the number of black chips is 0, which is also allowed. So, the inequality 2W Wc ≤5W +5Wc is satisfied as equality when W=5, Wc=5.

Wait, but when W=5, Wc=5, the condition holds because 2*5*5=50 and 5*5 +5*5=50, so 50 ≤50.

So, perhaps my earlier conclusion that when W=5, Wc must be 0 is incorrect. Let me re-examine the inequality.

The inequality is 2W Wc ≤5W +5Wc.

Let me rearrange it:

2W Wc -5W -5Wc ≤0.

Factor terms:

W Wc (2) -5W -5Wc ≤0.

Hmm, perhaps factorization isn't straightforward. Let me consider that for W and Wc between 0 and5, the maximum value of 2W Wc is 50 (when W=Wc=5). The maximum value of 5W +5Wc is 50 (when W=Wc=5). So, when W and Wc are 5, both sides are equal to 50.

So, for all W and Wc, 2W Wc ≤5W +5Wc. Let's see:

Take W=1, Wc=1: 2 ≤5+5 →2 ≤10, which holds.

Take W=2, Wc=2: 8 ≤10+10 →8 ≤20, holds.

Take W=3, Wc=3: 18 ≤15+15 →18 ≤30, holds.

Take W=4, Wc=4: 32 ≤20+20 →32 ≤40, holds.

Take W=5, Wc=5:50 ≤25+25 →50 ≤50, holds.

Take W=5, Wc=0: 0 ≤25+0 →0 ≤25, holds.

So, for all possible W and Wc between 0 and5, the inequality holds, meaning that the total number of chips is ≤25, which is acceptable.

Therefore, the number of configurations is the number of possible (W, Wc) pairs, where W is the number of white rows (0 ≤ W ≤5) and Wc is the number of white columns (0 ≤ Wc ≤5). For each (W, Wc), the number of ways to choose the white rows is C(5, W), and the number of ways to choose white columns is C(5, Wc). So, the total number of configurations would be the sum over W=0 to5 and Wc=0 to5 of C(5, W) * C(5, Wc).

Wait, but wait a minute. Because in our model, for each (W, Wc), the white rows and white columns are fixed, and the black rows and black columns are also fixed. So, the number of configurations would be the product of choosing W rows out of5 and Wc columns out of5, which is C(5, W) * C(5, Wc). But then, the total number of configurations would be the sum over W=0 to5 and Wc=0 to5 of C(5, W) * C(5, Wc).

But wait, let's compute that sum. The sum over W=0 to5 of C(5, W) is 2^5=32. Similarly, the sum over Wc=0 to5 of C(5, Wc) is also 32. So, the total sum would be 32 * 32 =1024, but that can't be right because that would imply 1024 configurations, which seems too high.

Wait, but perhaps not. Because for each W and Wc, the configuration is determined by selecting W rows and Wc columns. So, for example, choosing W=2 rows and Wc=3 columns would give C(5,2)*C(5,3)=10*10=100 configurations. But when you sum over all W and Wc, you get 1024, which seems way too high because the grid is only 5x5.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcounting because some configurations might be equivalent under different W and Wc choices. Wait, no, each choice of W and Wc gives a distinct configuration because the placement is determined by which rows and columns are white.

Wait, but let's think about this differently. Each cell can be in a white row and white column, white row and black column, black row and white column, or black row and black column. The white rows and white columns form a subgrid where all cells are white, and the black rows and black columns form another subgrid where all cells are black. The other cells are empty.

Wait, but perhaps the count is more than 1024 because each cell can be independently chosen? No, because the rows and columns have to be uniformly colored.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that each row can be independently white or black, and each column can be independently white or black, but with the constraint that for any cell (i,j), the color of row i and column j must be the same. So, if row i is white, then column j must be white for cell (i,j) to be white, but if row i is white and column j is black, then cell (i,j) must be empty.

Wait, but in this case, the assignment of row colors and column colors must be such that the color assignments are consistent for all cells. So, for example, if I decide that row 1 is white, then for column 1 to have any white cells, column 1 must also be white. Similarly, if row 1 is white and column 1 is black, then cell (1,1) must be empty.

Wait, but perhaps the only way to have a consistent assignment is if all the white rows are assigned white to the same set of columns, and the black rows to the same set of columns. So, perhaps the entire assignment is determined by choosing a subset of rows to be white and a subset of columns to be white, with the intersection being filled with white chips, and the intersection of black rows and black columns being filled with black chips.

Wait, that's the same model as before. So, the number of configurations is the number of ways to choose W white rows and Wc white columns, which is C(5, W) * C(5, Wc) for each W and Wc.

But then, the total number is the sum over W=0 to5 and Wc=0 to5 of C(5, W) * C(5, Wc). Which is (sum_{W=0 to5} C(5, W))^2 = (2^5)^2=1024.

But that can't be right because the problem states that each cell can have at most one chip, and that the placement is maximal. So, this approach must be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

"each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."

Wait, maybe the problem requires that in the current placement, all chips in any row are the same color, and all chips in any column are the same color. Also, the placement is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the first two conditions.

So, perhaps the grid is partitioned into some rows that are all white, some that are all black, some columns that are all white, some that are all black, and the cells where a white row meets a white column can have a white chip, and where a black row meets a black column can have a black chip. The other cells are empty.

In this model, the number of white chips is W * Wc, and black chips is B * Bc, where W is the number of white rows, B=5-W, Wc the number of white columns, Bc=5 - Wc.

Moreover, the placement is maximal, meaning that for any empty cell (i,j), either row i is white and column j is black, or row i is black and column j is white. Thus, no more chips can be added without causing a conflict.

So, the number of configurations is the number of possible (W, Wc) pairs, where W is from 0 to5 and Wc is from 0 to5, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the white rows and white columns.

Wait, that would mean for each W and Wc, the number of configurations is C(5, W) * C(5, Wc), and the total is sum_{W=0 to5} sum_{Wc=0 to5} C(5, W)*C(5, Wc).

Which is (2^5)^2 =1024, but that seems too high. But perhaps it's correct because for each row and column, you can choose their colors independently, as long as the cell colors are consistent.

Wait, but let's think: for each cell (i,j), if row i is white and column j is white, then cell (i,j) is white. If row i is black and column j is black, cell (i,j) is black. Otherwise, the cell is empty.

So, each cell's state is determined by the colors of its row and column. So, the entire grid's configuration is determined by the choice of which rows are white and which columns are white.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is indeed 2^5 (for rows) multiplied by 2^5 (for columns), which is 1024. But wait, that can't be right because the problem says that the placement is maximal, but in this model, some configurations might not be maximal.

Wait, no. Because in this model, every configuration is maximal. Because for any empty cell (i,j), either row i is white and column j is black, or row i is black and column j is white. So, you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column color rules.

Wait, but in this model, the number of configurations is 2^5 * 2^5=1024. But the problem allows up to 25 white and 25 black chips, but each configuration could use more or fewer.

Wait, but the problem states that you have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but you can use any number up to that. But in our model, the number of white chips is W*Wc and black chips is B*Bc. So, W*Wc + B*Bc must be ≤25, but as we saw earlier, for all W and Wc, this holds.

Wait, but in our model, each configuration is determined by choosing W and Wc, and the number of chips is W*Wc + (5-W)(5-Wc). So, the total number of configurations is 1024.

But that seems too high. Let me check with a smaller grid, like 1x1. For a 1x1 grid, the number of configurations would be 2 (white or black), but according to our model, it would be 2^1 * 2^1=4, which is incorrect. So, our model is wrong.

Wait, that's a problem. So, the model where each row and column can be independently chosen to be white or black leads to overcounting because in the 1x1 case, it's impossible to have four configurations. So, our earlier approach must be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the error is that for each row and column, their colors must be consistent. That is, the color of row i and column j must agree for all cells. So, for example, if row 1 is white, then all columns that intersect row 1 must be white in their respective rows. Wait, no, that's not correct because each column's color is independent of the rows.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think of the color assignments as matrices where each cell is either white or black, with the constraints that all cells in a row are the same color and all cells in a column are the same color. Wait, but that's only possible if all rows are the same color and all columns are the same color, which is not the case.

Wait, no. Let me think: If all rows are white, then all columns must be white as well, because otherwise, a column that's black would conflict with the white rows. So, the only possible configurations are where all rows and columns are the same color, which would give two configurations: all white or all black. But that can't be correct because the problem allows for some rows and columns to be white and others black.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that each row can be either white or black, and each column can be either white or black, but the color assignments must be consistent in the sense that for any cell (i,j), if row i is white and column j is white, then the cell is white. If row i is black and column j is black, the cell is black. Otherwise, the cell is empty.

In this model, the colors of the rows and columns can be chosen independently, but the cells are determined by the AND of the row and column colors. So, the number of possible color assignments for rows is 2^5, and for columns 2^5, giving 2^10=1024 possible assignments. But each such assignment determines which cells are filled (white or black) and which are empty.

But wait, in this case, the number of configurations would be 1024, but as we saw in the 1x1 case, this leads to overcounting because some assignments would require more than one chip in a cell, which is impossible. So, perhaps not all assignments are valid.

Wait, no. Because for each cell, it's either filled with a white chip (if row and column are white), filled with a black chip (if row and column are black), or empty otherwise. So, each cell is either white, black, or empty, but no cell can have more than one chip. So, each assignment of row and column colors leads to a valid configuration.

But in the 1x1 case, this would give 2 (row colors) * 2 (column colors) =4 configurations. But in reality, for a 1x1 grid, there are only 3 possible configurations: white chip, black chip, or empty. So, our model is overcounting by one.

Ah, so the problem is that when both the row and column are white, the cell is white, and when both are black, the cell is black. But when the row is white and column is black, the cell is empty, and vice versa. So, in the 1x1 case, the possible configurations are:

1. Row white, column white: cell is white.

2. Row white, column black: cell is empty.

3. Row black, column white: cell is empty.

4. Row black, column black: cell is black.

So, four configurations, but only three are valid because the cell can't be both white and black. Wait, no, in this model, each configuration is possible, but in reality, for a 1x1 grid, the cell can be either white, black, or empty, but our model gives four possibilities. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the model is correct, but the problem counts the configurations where the row and column colors can be chosen independently, leading to four possible configurations, but in reality, the cell can't be both white and black. So, perhaps the model is correct, and the 1x1 grid does have four configurations:

- Cell white (row white, column white).

- Cell black (row black, column black).

- Cell empty with row white and column black.

- Cell empty with row black and column white.

But in reality, the grid can only have one state at a time, so perhaps the model is correct, and the 1x1 grid does have four configurations. But that doesn't make sense because the cell can't be both white and black. So, perhaps the model is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the color assignments for rows and columns must be such that for each cell (i,j), the color is the same as the row's color if the column's color is white, or the same as the column's color if the row's color is white. Hmm, this is getting too confusing.

Let me try a different approach. Let's think of the grid as being partitioned into four blocks by selecting a subset of rows and columns. The intersection of white rows and white columns is filled with white chips. The intersection of black rows and black columns is filled with black chips. The other cells are empty.

In this case, the number of configurations is determined by choosing W white rows and Wc white columns. The number of ways to choose W white rows is C(5, W), and the number of ways to choose Wc white columns is C(5, Wc). So, the total number of configurations is sum_{W=0 to5} sum_{Wc=0 to5} C(5, W) * C(5, Wc).

Which is (2^5) * (2^5) =1024.

But earlier, in the 1x1 case, this would give 4 configurations, but in reality, there are only 3 possible states: white, black, or empty. So, perhaps our model is overcounting by one because when W=1 and Wc=1, the cell is white, when W=0 and Wc=0, it's black, and the other two cases are empty. Wait, but no, in the 1x1 case, the model would have:

- W=1, Wc=1: cell is white.

- W=0, Wc=0: cell is black.

- W=1, Wc=0: cell is empty.

- W=0, Wc=1: cell is empty.

So, four configurations, but only three distinct states. So, the model counts some configurations as different when they result in the same cell state. So, perhaps the model is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for different color assignments that result in the same grid state, which would mean that the model counts correctly, but the problem's conditions might not allow some of those configurations.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that all white chips are placed, and all black chips are placed, but that's not the case because the problem allows for some cells to be empty.

Wait, no, the problem says "some of these chips", so we can have varying numbers.

But perhaps I should proceed with the initial model, accepting that the number of configurations is 1024, but that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting because the problem requires that the placement is maximal, which may impose additional constraints.

Wait, let's think again about the maximal condition. The placement is maximal if no more chips can be added without violating the row or column conditions. So, for any empty cell (i,j), adding a chip there would require that the row i's color and column j's color are the same. But if row i is white and column j is black, then adding a white chip would violate the column's color (which must be black), and adding a black chip would violate the row's color (which must be white). So, such cells can't have any chips, which means that the configuration is maximal.

So, any configuration where the colors of the rows and columns are chosen such that for any empty cell (i,j), the row i's color is different from column j's color, is maximal.

Therefore, the number of maximal configurations is indeed the number of ways to choose the colors of the rows and columns, which is 2^5 (for rows) * 2^5 (for columns) =1024. But that can't be right because when I choose row colors and column colors, some of these configurations would have overlapping white and black chips, which is impossible.

Wait, no. Because in our model, a cell can only be white or black, not both. So, each cell is either white, black, or empty, but not both colors. So, the model is correct, and the number of configurations is 1024. But wait, the problem specifies that the chips are placed on the grid, meaning that at least one chip must be placed. So, perhaps we need to subtract the cases where all cells are empty, which would be when all rows and columns are colored such that their intersections are empty. But that's only one case: all rows and columns are colored oppositely. Wait, no, because if all rows are white and all columns are black, then all cells are empty. Similarly, all rows black and all columns white also result in all cells being empty. So, there are two cases where all cells are empty. So, the total number of configurations would be 1024 -2=1022.

But that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the empty grid as a valid configuration, as it satisfies the conditions, because you can't add any chips without violating the rules. So, perhaps the total is 1024.

But let's think again. The problem says "some of these chips", which implies that at least one chip is placed. So, the empty grid (all cells empty) would not be counted, as it doesn't place any chips. Therefore, the total number of configurations would be 1024 -2=1022.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check with a smaller grid, say 1x1. The possible configurations where at least one chip is placed would be:

1. White chip (row white, column white).

2. Black chip (row black, column black).

So, two configurations, but according to our model, it would be 2^1 *2^1 -2=2*2-2=2, which matches. So, that seems correct.

Another test: 2x2 grid. According to our model, the number of configurations with at least one chip is 2^2 *2^2 -2=16-2=14.

Let's see: each cell can be white, black, or empty, but the placement must satisfy that all chips in a row are the same color and all in a column are the same color.

In a 2x2 grid, possible configurations with at least one chip:

Each row can be all white or all black, and each column can be all white or all black. But the placement must be such that for any cell (i,j), if row i is white and column j is white, it's white; if row i is black and column j is black, it's black; else, empty.

So, for 2x2 grid, the possible non-empty configurations are:

- All rows white and all columns white: all white chips.

- All rows white and columns: some white, some black.

Wait, no, each column is either all white or all black. So, for example:

1. All rows white, all columns white: all four cells white.

2. All rows white, column 1 white, column 2 black: cells (1,1) and (2,1) white; cells (1,2) and (2,2) empty.

3. All rows white, column 1 black, column 2 white: cells (1,2) and (2,2) white; others empty.

4. All rows white, all columns black: all cells empty (but this is excluded because we have to have at least one chip).

Similarly, all rows black:

5. All columns white: all four cells black.

6. Columns 1 white, 2 black: cells (1,1) and (2,1) black; others empty.

7. Columns 1 black, 2 white: cells (1,2) and (2,2) black; others empty.

8. All columns black: all cells empty (excluded).

Additionally, mixed row colors:

Wait, but no. Because in this model, all rows are either white or black, and all columns are either white or black. So, for example, if some rows are white and others are black, and similarly for columns, we get more configurations.

Wait, but in this case, the number of configurations would be 2^2 (row color options) *2^2 (column color options) -2 (all empty cases) =16-2=14, which matches our previous calculation.

So, our model seems to hold for smaller grids, implying that for the 5x5 grid, the number of configurations is 2^5 *2^5 -2=1024-2=1022.

But the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can use any number up to that, as long as the conditions are satisfied. So, in our model, the number of white chips is W*Wc, and black chips is B*Bc, where W is the number of white rows, Wc the number of white columns, B=5-W, Bc=5-Wc.

But the problem allows up to 25 white and 25 black chips, which is more than sufficient because the maximum number of white chips is 5*5=25, and same for black.

So, the total number of configurations is 1024, but excluding the two cases where all cells are empty, giving 1022.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips", which implies that at least one chip is placed. So, the two all-empty cases (all rows and columns white vs black, leading to all cells empty) should be excluded. So, the answer is 1024-2=1022.

But wait, wait a minute. Because when all rows are white and all columns are white, all 25 cells are white, which uses 25 white chips. Similarly, when all rows are black and all columns are black, all 25 cells are black, using 25 black chips. These are valid configurations, so they shouldn't be excluded. The only case that should be excluded is when all rows and columns are colored such that all cells are empty, which happens when all rows are white and all columns are black, or all rows are black and all columns are white. So, those are the two cases where all cells are empty. Therefore, the total number of configurations is 1024-2=1022.

But wait, no. Because in our model, when all rows are white and all columns are white, we have all 25 cells filled with white chips, which is allowed. Similarly, when all rows are black and all columns are black, all 25 cells are black chips, which is allowed. The only cases where all cells are empty are when all rows are white and all columns are black, or all rows are black and all columns are white. So, those two cases should be subtracted.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is 1024-2=1022.

But the problem mentions placing some of the chips, which implies that at least one chip is placed, so the two all-empty cases should be excluded. Therefore, the answer is 1022.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Each configuration is determined by the choice of white rows (W) and white columns (Wc). The number of such configurations is C(5, W) * C(5, Wc) for each W and Wc. Summing over all W and Wc gives 1024. But in two of these configurations, all cells are empty: when W=0 and Wc=0 (all rows black, all columns black, but wait, no, if W=0, all rows are black, and Wc=0, all columns are black. Then, the intersection of black rows and black columns would be all cells, filled with black chips. So, that configuration is not empty. Similarly, when W=5 and Wc=5, all cells are white. The only configurations where all cells are empty are when W=5 and Wc=0, or W=0 and Wc=5. Because in those cases, white rows and white columns don't overlap, and black rows and black columns don't overlap either. So, those are the two cases where all cells are empty. So, those two configurations should be excluded if we require at least one chip to be placed.

Thus, the total number of configurations is 1024-2=1022.


The problem requires placing some white and black chips on a 5×5 grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row and column have the same color, and the placement is maximal (no additional chip can be placed without violating the conditions).

To solve this, we consider the grid as being determined by the colors of its rows and columns. Each row can be either white or black, and each column can be either white or black. The color assignments must be consistent: a cell is white if its row and column are both white, black if its row and column are both black, and empty otherwise. This ensures that all chips in a row or column are of the same color.

The total number of ways to assign colors to the rows and columns is \(2^5 \times 2^5 = 1024\). However, two of these configurations result in all cells being empty: when all rows are white and all columns are black, and when all rows are black and all columns are white. Since the problem specifies that "some of these chips" must be placed, these two all-empty configurations are excluded.

Thus, the number of valid configurations is \(1024 - 2 = 1022\).

The final answer is:

\boxed{1022}
