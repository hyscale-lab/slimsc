Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to make sense of it. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I'm supposed to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm. First, let me remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they are in a square. Wait, no, wait—no, actually in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C should be (-x, -y), because the midpoint between A and C is the origin. Similarly, points B and D would be such that their midpoint is also the origin. So if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

So, all four points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola. So, each of them satisfies the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all four sides are equal in length. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.

But maybe instead of dealing with the sides, since we're dealing with diagonals, we can use the properties of the rhombus. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1.

Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. So diagonal AC goes from A(x, y) to C(-x, -y), and diagonal BD goes from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q).

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the slopes of AC and BD multiply to -1.

First, let's find the slopes. The slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p.

Since they are perpendicular, (y/x) * (q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1, which implies y q = -x p. So, y q + x p = 0.

That's one condition.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, the lengths of the diagonals relate to the sides. The area of a rhombus
