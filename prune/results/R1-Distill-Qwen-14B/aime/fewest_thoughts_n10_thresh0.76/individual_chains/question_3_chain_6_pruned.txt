Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event we're interested in, and B is the condition.

In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, we need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But wait, if A is a subset of B (since winning the grand prize automatically means winning a prize), then P(A and B) is just P(A). So, it simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So, first, I need to compute P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and P(B), the probability that she wins a prize.

Let's break it down.

First, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is the combination of 10 choose 4. C(n, k) is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!).

So, C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, the total number of possible winning combinations is 210.

Now, P(A): the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since Jen has already picked 4 numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (only her specific set of 4). So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, P(B): the probability that Jen wins a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are chosen. This can be a bit trickier because "at least two" includes the cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers are chosen. So, we need to compute the number of favorable outcomes for each case and sum them up.

Let me think. So, for B, the number of favorable combinations is the sum of the number of ways to choose exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four of Jen's numbers.

So, let's denote that:

- Number of ways to choose exactly 2 of Jen's numbers: C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because she has 4 numbers, we choose 2 from those, and the remaining 2 from the other 6 numbers not chosen by her.

Similarly, for exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1).

And for exactly 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Then, the total number of favorable outcomes for B is [C(4,2)*C(6,2)] + [C(4,3)*C(6,1)] + [C(4,4)*C(6,0)].

Let me compute each term.

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2) = 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.

C(4,3) = 4, C(6,1) = 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.

C(4,4) = 1, C(6,0) = 1. So, 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115. Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait a second, let me check that. So, 90 + 24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yep, that's correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210.

Then, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) divided by (115/210). The 210s cancel out, so it's 1/115.

Wait, is that right? So, the probability is 1/115, and since 1 and 115 are coprime, m is 1 and n is 115, so m + n is 116?

Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me verify if I didn't make a mistake in calculating P(B). Let me recount.

The formula for the number of ways to have exactly k matches is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k). Because you choose k numbers from Jen's 4 and the remaining (4−k) from the other 6 numbers.

So, for exactly 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Exactly 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Total: 90 +24 +1 = 115.

Yes, that seems correct. So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, but another way to compute P(B) is to compute 1 minus the probability that she doesn't win a prize, which is when less than two numbers match. So, that would be 1 - [prob of exactly 0 or exactly 1 matches]. Let me compute that and see if I get the same.

Number of ways for exactly 0 matches: C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1 * 15 = 15.

Number of ways for exactly 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, total non-winning cases: 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of winning cases is total (210) - 95 = 115. So, same result. So, P(B) is indeed 115/210.

So, P(A|B) is (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115.

So, m is 1, n is 115. They are coprime because 115 is 5*23, both primes, and 1 shares no common factors with them. So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.

Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four are chosen. So, given that
