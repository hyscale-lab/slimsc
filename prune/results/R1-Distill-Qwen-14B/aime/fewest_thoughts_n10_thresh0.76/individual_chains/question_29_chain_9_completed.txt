Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So AB is 107, BC is 16. That would make CD also 16, and AD equal to BC, which is 16? Wait, no, wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB and CD are both 107, while BC and AD are both 16. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, AB is 107, BC is 16. So in rectangle ABCD, AB is the length and BC is the width. So the sides are AB=107, BC=16, so CD=107, DA=16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has FG=17 and EF=184. Wait, EF is one side, FG is another. So EF=184, FG=17. So in rectangle EFGH, EF is the length, FG is the width. So sides EF=184, FG=17, GH=184, HE=17.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So they lie on a straight line. Let me think about their positions. Since D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, and C is the opposite corner. So in rectangle ABCD, the order of the points is probably A, B, C, D, going around the rectangle. So D is connected to A and C.

But now, E is a corner of rectangle EFGH, and F is another point. So since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line must be passing through D, then E, then C, then F.

Wait, but in rectangle EFGH, F is a corner. So perhaps EFGH is placed such that F is on the same line as D and C. Hmm.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So those four points are concyclic. That suggests that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. Hmm, cyclic quadrilaterals have properties like the sum of opposite angles equals 180 degrees, or the power of a point, etc.

I think I should assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, AB is 107. Wait, let me define the coordinates step by step.

Let me place point D at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, AB is 107. So if D is at (0,0), then C, which is adjacent to D, would be at (16, 0). Wait, no, because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if D is at (0,0), then C could be at (16,0), and B would be at (16, 107), and A would be at (0,107). Wait, hold on. Wait, no, that can't be. Because in a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So if AB is 107, BC is 16.

Wait, perhaps it's better to define the rectangle with AB as the vertical side. Wait, no, wait, in rectangles, the sides are length and width, but without loss of generality, maybe I should just assign coordinates accordingly.

Let me think, if ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then if we move along DC, which is length BC=16, so point C would be at (16,0). Then, since AB is 107, and ABCD is a rectangle, point B would be at (16, 107), and point A would be at (0,107). So ABCD has coordinates A(0,107), B(16,107), C(16,0), D(0,0). Is that correct? Let me check: AB is from (0,107) to (16,107), so that's length 16? Wait, no, no. AB is 107, BC is 16. Wait, so if AB is 107, then the distance from A to B is 107, so that would be a vertical line if AB is vertical. Wait, perhaps I mixed up the sides.

Alternatively, maybe AB is the length and BC is the width. So, I might have placed AB as the vertical side, but that would make AB=16, which contradicts AB=107. So I need to adjust my coordinate system.

Let me try again. Let me place point D at (0,0). Let me assume that DC is along the x-axis, so point C is at (16,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point B will be at (16, y) and point A at (0, y). The length AB is 107, so the distance from A(0,y) to B(16,y) is 16 units. But AB is given as 107. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I have the sides mixed up. So, if AB is 107, and BC is 16, then AB is the length of the side from A to B, which would be the vertical side if ABCD is arranged with AB and CD as vertical sides. So, perhaps A is at (0,0), B at (0,107), C at (16,107), and D at (16,0). Then AB is 107, BC is 16, CD is 107, DA is 16. That makes sense. So ABCD is placed vertically.

Wait, but in that case, point D would be at (16,0), point C at (16,107). But wait, that can't be because BC is the width. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps AB is the base, so A is at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). So that AB is 107, BC is 16. That makes more sense. So ABCD is a rectangle with length 107 and height 16.

Yes, that seems correct. So in this coordinate system, A is (0,0), B is (107,0), C is (107,16), and D is (0,16). So now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So the line passes through D(0,16), E, C(107,16), F.

Wait, so D is at (0,16), and C is at (107,16). So the line DC is horizontal, at y=16. So points E and F must lie on this line as well. So E and F are somewhere on the line y=16.

Wait, but E is a corner of rectangle EFGH. So EFGH is another rectangle. Let me see, EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. So EF is one side, FG is another. So in rectangle EFGH, sides EF and GH are 184, and sides FG and HE are 17.

Hmm, so EFGH is a rectangle with length 184 and width 17. Now, in the problem, E is a point on the line DC (y=16), and F is another point on the same line. So in rectangle EFGH, E and F are two adjacent corners. So, E is connected to F and to H, and F is connected to E and G.

Wait, in the rectangle EFGH, the points are E, F, G, H. So the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. So E is connected to F and H, F is connected to E and G.

Since E and F are on the line DC, which is horizontal at y=16, and EF is a side of rectangle EFGH, which is 184 units long. So the distance from E to F is 184 units along the line y=16.

But wait, in the coordinate system, DC is from D(0,16) to C(107,16), which is only 107 units long. But E and F are points on this line, with EF=184. That's longer than DC itself. That doesn't seem possible.

Wait, that can't be. There must be something wrong with my assumption.

Wait, perhaps E and F are not on DC but on the extension of DC beyond D and C. So D, E, C, F are collinear, but the line is not DC itself, but a line that passes through D, E, C, F in that order, meaning that E is beyond D, and F is beyond C.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, point D is at (0,16), point C is at (107,16). So if we have points D, E, C, F collinear, with E and F on the same line as DC but extended beyond D and C.

So the line is y=16, extending to the left from D(0,16) to E, and to the right from C(107,16) to F. So E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C.

So E is at some point (x, 16), where x < 0, and F is at some point (y, 16), where y > 107.

Now, in rectangle EFGH, EF is a side of length 184. So the distance between E and F is 184. But E and F are on the line y=16, so the distance is |y - x| = 184.

But in our coordinate system, E is left of D, which is at (0,16), so x < 0. F is right of C, at (107,16), so y > 107. So the distance between E and F is y - x = 184.

But D is at (0,16), and E is at (x,16), so the distance between E and D is |0 - x| = |x|. Similarly, the distance between C and F is |y - 107|.

But since E is on the line extending left from D, and F is on the line extending right from C, the total length from E to F is (distance from E to D) + (distance from D to C) + (distance from C to F).

Wait, so E to D is |x|, D to C is 107, C to F is (y - 107). So E to F is |x| + 107 + (y - 107) = |x| + y = 184.

But since x is negative, |x| = -x. So, -x + y = 184.

We also know that, in rectangle EFGH, FG is 17. FG is another side, connected to F. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is perpendicular to EF. Since EF is along the line y=16, FG must be vertical. So from F, which is at (y,16), moving up or down 17 units.

So point G is at (y, 16 + 17) = (y, 33) or (y, 16 -17) = (y, -1). But since the rectangle is EFGH, the order is E-F-G-H-E. So from F, moving to G, which is up or down.

Similarly, from E, moving to H, which is also perpendicular to EF. Since EF is horizontal, EH must be vertical as well. So H is at (x, 16 +17) or (x, 16 -17).

But the problem says that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So these four points are concyclic. Let's see: A is at (0,0), D is at (0,16), H is at (x, 33) or (x, -1), and G is at (y,33) or (y,-1). Hmm.

Wait, let's think. If H is at (x, 16 +17) = (x,33), then G would be at (y,33) if we move from F up, or (y,-1) if we move down. Similarly, H could be (x,-1) if we move down from E.

But let's suppose that the rectangle EFGH is above the line EF. So H is at (x,33) and G is at (y,33). So both H and G are at y=33.

Alternatively, if the rectangle is below, H and G would be at y=-1. But let me check if that makes sense.

Wait, but points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So if H and G are above EF, then H is at (x,33), G at (y,33). Let me see.

So A is at (0,0), D at (0,16), H at (x,33), G at (y,33). These four points lie on a circle.

Alternatively, if H and G are below, at (x,-1) and (y,-1), but then A is at (0,0), which is above these points. Maybe a circle could pass through them, but let me see.

But let's first consider the case where H and G are above at y=33.

So, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33), G(y,33) lie on a circle. Let me try to find the equation of the circle passing through these four points.

The general equation of a circle is (X - h)^2 + (Y - k)^2 = r^2.

Since points A, D, H, G lie on this circle, plugging in each point:

For A(0,0):
h² + k² = r² ... (1)

For D(0,16):
h² + (16 - k)² = r² ... (2)

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):
(16 - k)² - k² = 0
256 -32k +k² -k² =0
256 -32k =0
32k =256
k=8

So the center of the circle is at (h,8). Now, using equation (1): h² + 8² = r² => h² +64 = r².

Now, plug in point H(x,33):

(x - h)^2 + (33 -8)^2 = r²
(x - h)^2 + 25² = r²
(x - h)^2 +625 = r² ... (3)

Similarly, plug in point G(y,33):

(y - h)^2 +625 = r² ... (4)

From equations (3) and (4):

(x - h)^2 = (y - h)^2

Taking square roots, considering that x < 0 and y >107, it's possible that x - h = -(y - h). So:

x - h = - (y - h)
x - h = -y + h
x + y = 2h

So, x + y = 2h ... (5)

We also know from earlier that -x + y = 184 ... (from EF=184). So:

Equation (5): x + y = 2h

Equation (6): -x + y = 184

Let me add equations (5) and (6):

(x + y) + (-x + y) = 2h + 184
2y = 2h + 184
y = h + 92 ... (7)

Subtracting equation (6) from equation (5):

(x + y) - (-x + y) = 2h -184
2x =2h -184
x = h -92 ... (8)

So from equations (7) and (8):

x = h -92

y = h +92

So now, from equation (3):

(x - h)^2 +625 = r²

But x = h -92, so x - h = -92.

So (-92)^2 +625 = r²

92² = 8464

So 8464 +625 = 9089 = r²

So r² =9089

But from equation (1):

h² +64=9089

h² =9089 -64 =9025

h= sqrt(9025)=95 or h=-95

But since in our coordinate system, E is to the left of D, which is at x=0, so E is at (x,16), where x <0. Similarly, F is to the right of C at (107,16), so y>107.

From equation (7), y= h +92.

If h=95, then y=95+92=187. Which is greater than 107, which fits F's position.

If h=-95, then y= -95 +92= -3. But that would place F at (y,16) where y=-3, which is to the left of D(0,16). But we have F to the right of C(107,16), so y must be >107. So h can't be -95.

So h=95, which gives y=187, which is correct. Then x= h-92=95-92=3. Wait, but x=3, which is positive. But E is supposed to be to the left of D(0,16), so x should be negative. So that's a problem.

Hmm, that suggests a mistake. Because if h=95, x=3, which is to the right of D, which contradicts our initial assumption that E is to the left of D.

So perhaps the other case where H and G are below EF at y=-1.

Let me try that.

So H is at (x, -1), G is at (y, -1).

So points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1), G(y,-1) lie on a circle.

Again, general equation:

(X - h)^2 + (Y -k)^2 = r^2.

Plug in A(0,0):

h² + k² = r² ... (1)

Plug in D(0,16):

h² + (16 -k)^2 = r² ... (2)

Subtract (1) from (2):

(16 -k)^2 -k²=0

256 -32k +k² -k²=0

256 -32k=0

32k=256

k=8

So center is at (h,8). Then equation (1):

h² +64 = r²

Now, plug in H(x,-1):

(x - h)^2 + (-1 -8)^2 = r²

(x - h)^2 +81 = r² ... (3)

Similarly, plug in G(y,-1):

(y - h)^2 +81 = r² ... (4)

From (3) and (4):

(x - h)^2 = (y - h)^2

Which leads to x - h = ±(y - h)

Case 1: x - h = y - h → x = y. But EF is of length 184, so y =x +184. But that would imply x =x +184, which is impossible.

Case 2: x - h = - (y - h) → x - h = -y + h → x + y = 2h ... (5)

Same as before.

We also have from EF=184, which is |y -x|=184. Since E is at (x,16) and F is at (y,16), and x <0, y >107, we have y -x =184.

So:

y -x =184 ... (6)

From (5): x + y =2h

From (6): y -x =184

Let me add (5) and (6):

(x + y) + (y -x) = 2h +184

2y =2h +184 → y =h +92 ... (7)

Subtract (6) from (5):

(x + y) - (y -x )=2h -184

2x =2h -184 → x =h -92 ... (8)

So, same as before.

Now, from equation (3):

(x - h)^2 +81 = r²

But x =h -92, so x -h = -92

So (-92)^2 +81= r²

92²=8464, so 8464 +81=8545= r²

From equation (1):

h² +64 =8545 → h²=8545 -64=8481

h= sqrt(8481). Let me compute sqrt(8481).

Hmm, 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So sqrt(8481) is between 92 and 93.

Compute 92.1^2=92^2 +2*92*0.1 +0.1^2=8464+18.4+0.01=8482.41, which is bigger than 8481. So 92.1^2=8482.41.

So 92^2=8464, 92.05^2= ?

Wait, 92.05^2= (92 +0.05)^2=92^2 + 2*92*0.05 +0.05^2=8464 +9.2 +0.0025=8473.2025. Hmm, less than 8481.

So 92.05^2=8473.2025; 92.1^2=8482.41.

So 8481 is between 92.05 and 92.1.

But perhaps 8481 is a perfect square. Let me check.

Wait, 8481 divided by 3: 8+4+8+1=21, which is divisible by 3, so 8481/3=2827.

Wait, 2827: 2+8+2+7=19, not divisible by 3. Let me check if 2827 is divisible by 7: 2827 /7=403.857... Not exact.

Wait, perhaps 8481 is 92.06^2? Not sure, but perhaps it's not a perfect square. But maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

From equation (3): (x - h)^2 +81 = r².

x = h -92, so x -h = -92. So (-92)^2=8464. 8464 +81=8545. So r²=8545.

Then from equation (1): h² +64=8545 → h²=8545-64=8481.

Wait, 8481: Let me check if it's 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So 8481 isn't a perfect square. So h= sqrt(8481)= approximately 92.1.

But let's see, in equation (7): y= h +92. If h is approximately 92.1, then y≈184.1, which is more than 107, which fits F being to the right of C.

And x= h -92 ≈92.1 -92=0.1. But x must be less than 0 since E is to the left of D(0,16). So x≈0.1, but that's to the right of D, which is at 0. So this is a problem.

Wait, so x= h-92. If h is 95, x=3. If h is 92, x=0. But in the case where H and G are below, the h is sqrt(8481)=~92.1, which gives x= h-92≈0.1, which is barely to the right of D, which is at x=0. But E is supposed to be to the left of D.

This suggests that perhaps the assumption that H and G are below EF might not hold, but the calculation leads to x being positive, which is conflicting.

Wait, maybe I got the assignment of H and G wrong. Maybe in the rectangle EFGH, H is to the left and G is to the right, but their y-coordinates are different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in rectangle EFGH, from E, we move to H, which is either up or down, and from F, we move to G, which is either up or down. But in the case where H is at (x,33) and G is at (y,-1), but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle EFGH is such that H is at (x,33) and G is at (y,33), but in that case, we saw that x=3, which is to the right of D, which conflicts with E being to the left.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is placed such that from E, we move down to H, and from F, we move up to G, but that would make H and G at different y-coordinates, complicating the circle.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently, using the cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Since points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the power of point E with respect to this circle can be used. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since ADHG is cyclic, the angles at A and G should be supplementary.

Wait, maybe using coordinates is the way to go, but perhaps I made an error in the initial setup.

Wait, let me re-examine the coordinate system. Perhaps I should have placed point D at a different location.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that ABCD is placed such that AB is vertical. So A is at (0,0), B at (0,107), C at (16,107), D at (16,0). Hmm, but then BC is 16, which would be the width. So then, DC is from D(16,0) to C(16,107). So the line DC is vertical. Then points D(16,0), E, C(16,107), F are collinear along a vertical line. But that would make EF=184 impossible, since the line DC is only 107 units long. So E and F would have to be beyond D and C on the vertical line x=16.

But in that case, E is below D, at (16, -something), and F is above C at (16, 107 + something). Then, EF would be the distance between E and F, which is (107 + something) - (-something) =107 + 2*something=184. So 2*something=77 → something=38.5. So E is at (16,-38.5), F at (16, 145.5).

But then, in rectangle EFGH, EF is vertical of length 184, and FG is 17. So FG is horizontal from F(16,145.5) to G(16 +17,145.5)=(33,145.5). Similarly, EH is horizontal from E(16,-38.5) to H(16 -17, -38.5)=(-1,-38.5).

So points A, D, H, G would be A(0,0), D(16,0), H(-1,-38.5), G(33,145.5). Wait, but these four points need to lie on a circle. Let me check if they lie on a circle.

To check if four points lie on a circle, we can use the determinant method.

The determinant for concyclic points is:

|x y x² + y² 1|
for each point.

But maybe it's easier to compute the circle equation.

Let me try to find the circle passing through A(0,0), D(16,0), H(-1,-38.5), G(33,145.5).

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps this setup is correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in this coordinate system, the line DC is vertical, so E and F are along the same vertical line, which makes EF vertical, and FG horizontal. So the rectangle EFGH is placed such that E is at (16,-38.5), F at (16,145.5), G at (33,145.5), H at (-1,-38.5).

Now, checking if A(0,0), D(16,0), H(-1,-38.5), G(33,145.5) lie on a circle.

Let me find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H.

General equation: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c=0.

Plug in A(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 → c=0.

So equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy=0.

Plug in D(16,0):

16² +0 +2g*16 +0=0 → 256 +32g=0 → 32g= -256 → g= -8.

Plug in H(-1,-38.5):

(-1)^2 + (-38.5)^2 + 2*(-8)*(-1) + 2f*(-38.5)=0.

Compute:

1 + 1482.25 + 16 -77f=0 → (1 +1482.25)=1483.25, plus 16 is 1499.25.

So 1499.25 -77f=0 → 77f=1499.25 → f=1499.25 /77.

Calculating 77*19=1463, 77*19.5=1463 +38.5=1501.5. Which is more than 1499.25.

So f=19.5 - (2.25/77)= approximately 19.5 -0.029=19.471.

So the circle equation is x² + y² -16x + 2*19.471y=0.

Now, check if G(33,145.5) lies on this circle.

Compute x² + y² -16x + 38.942y.

33²=1089, y²=145.5²=21170.25, -16x= -528, 38.942y ≈38.942*145.5≈38.942*140=5451.88 +38.942*5.5≈214.181 → total≈5451.88+214.181≈5666.061.

So total=1089 +21170.25 -528 +5666.061.

Compute step by step:

1089 +21170.25=22259.25

22259.25 -528=21731.25

21731.25 +5666.061≈27397.311.

Which is not zero. So G does not lie on the circle. Thus, this configuration is invalid.

Hmm, that suggests that my initial assumption about the placement of rectangles might be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the line D, E, C, F is not vertical but horizontal. Let me try that again.

Wait, earlier I thought DC was horizontal at y=16, but that led to some inconsistencies.

Let me try placing ABCD such that AB is horizontal.

So, let me place A at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), D at (0,16). So, AB is 107, BC is 16.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear on a horizontal line. So line y=16, from D(0,16) to C(107,16). So E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C.

So E is at (x,16), x<0, and F is at (y,16), y>107.

EF is 184 units long, so |y -x|=184 → y -x=184.

In rectangle EFGH, FG=17. Since EF is horizontal, FG must be vertical. So from F(y,16), moving up or down 17 units to get G. Similarly, from E(x,16), moving up or down 17 units to get H.

So, if we move up, G would be at (y,16+17)=(y,33), H at (x,33).

Alternatively, moving down, G at (y, -1), H at (x,-1).

Now, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33 or -1), G(y,33 or -1) lie on a circle.

Let's try the case where H and G are above at y=33.

So H is at (x,33), G at (y,33).

Now, four points on circle: A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33), G(y,33).

Let's find the equation of the circle passing through these points.

Using the general equation: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy +c=0.

Plug in A(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 → c=0.

So equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy=0.

Plug in D(0,16):

0 + 256 +0 +32f=0 → 256 +32f=0 → f= -8.

So equation becomes x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Now, plug in H(x,33):

x² + (33)^2 +2g x -16*33=0 → x² +1089 +2gx -528=0 → x² +2gx +561=0 ... (3)

Similarly, plug in G(y,33):

y² +1089 +2g y -528=0 → y² +2g y +561=0 ... (4)

From (3) and (4):

For point H: x² +2g x +561=0

For point G: y² +2g y +561=0

So both satisfy the same equation.

Thus, x and y are roots of the equation t² +2g t +561=0.

So, the sum of roots x + y = -2g.

The product x*y=561.

Also, from EF=184, y -x=184.

So, we have:

x + y = -2g ... (5)

y -x=184 ... (6)

From (5) and (6):

Adding: 2y= -2g +184 → y= (-g +92)

Subtracting: 2x= -2g -184 → x= (-g -92)

Now, from product: x*y=561.

Substitute x= -g -92, y= -g +92.

So:

(-g -92)(-g +92) =561

This is (g +92)(g -92)=561 → g² - (92)^2=561 → g²=561 + 8464=9025 → g= sqrt(9025)=95 or g=-95.

So, two cases:

Case 1: g=95

Then,

y= -95 +92= -3

x= -95 -92= -187

But y must be >107, but here y=-3, which is to the left of D. So this is invalid.

Case 2: g=-95

Then,

y=95 +92=187

x=95 -92=3

So, y=187, which is >107, valid.

x=3, which is >0, so E is at (3,16), which is to the right of D(0,16). But E is supposed to be to the left of D. So this is invalid.

Hmm, this is a problem. It seems that in both cases, either y is invalid or x is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let's see: the equation for H is x² +2gx +561=0.

If g is positive, then x would be negative because product x*y=561 is positive, so x and y have same signs.

Wait, but in our setup, E is to the left of D (x<0), and F is to the right of C (y>107). So x and y should have opposite signs, which would make their product negative, but our product is 561, positive. So this is a contradiction.

So, perhaps the assumption that H and G are above EF is wrong. Let me try the case where H and G are below EF at y=-1.

So H is at (x,-1), G at (y,-1).

So, four points on circle: A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1), G(y,-1).

Using the circle equation x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0.

Plug in A(0,0): c=0.

So equation becomes x² + y² +2gx +2fy=0.

Plug in D(0,16):

0 + 256 +0 +32f=0 → 32f= -256 → f= -8.

So equation: x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Now, plug in H(x,-1):

x² +1 +2g x -(-16)=0 → x² +2g x +17=0 ... (3)

Plug in G(y,-1):

y² +1 +2g y -(-16)=0 → y² +2g y +17=0 ... (4)

So, from (3) and (4), x and y are roots of t² +2g t +17=0.

Sum of roots: x + y = -2g.

Product: x*y=17.

Also, from EF=184: y -x=184.

So, we have:

x + y= -2g ... (5)

y -x=184 ... (6)

Adding (5) and (6):

2y= -2g +184 → y= (-g +92) ... (7)

Subtracting (6) from (5):

2x= -2g -184 → x= (-g -92) ... (8)

Product x*y=17.

Substitute (7) and (8):

x= -g -92

y= -g +92

So,

(-g -92)*(-g +92)=17

Which is (g +92)(g -92)=17 → g² - 92²=17 → g²=17 + 8464=8481.

So g= sqrt(8481)= approximately 92.1, but more precisely, 92.1^2=8482.41, which is more than 8481. So g= sqrt(8481)= about 92.05.

But let's compute sqrt(8481).

Wait, 92^2=8464. 92*92=8464.

92*92= (90+2)^2=8100+360+4=8464.

So, 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So 8481 is 17 units above 92^2, so sqrt(8481)=92 + 17/(2*92) approximately, using linear approximation.

Which is about 92 + 0.0923≈92.0923.

So, g≈92.0923.

Then,

From (7): y= -g +92= -92.0923 +92= -0.0923.

From (8): x= -g -92= -92.0923 -92= -184.0923.

So, E is at (x,16)= (-184.0923,16), which is far to the left of D(0,16), which is correct.

F is at (y,16)= (-0.0923,16), which is just to the left of D. But according to our setup, F should be to the right of C(107,16). So y should be >107, but here y≈-0.0923, which is to the left of D. So this is a problem.

This suggests that something is wrong with the setup. Maybe I need to consider that FG is 17 and EF is 184, but perhaps the direction is different.

Wait, perhaps in rectangle EFGH, the sides are FG=17 and EF=184, but they could be arranged differently. Maybe EF is vertical and FG is horizontal. But then EF=184 would be the vertical side, which would make the rectangle taller than wide.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that EF=184 and FG=17. So EF is one side, FG is another, so they are adjacent sides. So if EF is horizontal, FG is vertical, or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with vectors or coordinate transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the position of point E and F.

Since points D, E, C, F are collinear, and E is to the left of D, F is to the right of C, with EF=184.

So ED + DC + CF=EF=184.

Wait, but DC is 107, so ED + CF=77.

But I don't know ED or CF individually.

Alternatively, perhaps CE is the segment we're asked to find, which is the distance from C to E.

Wait, but E is to the left of D, so CE would be CD + DE=107 + DE.

But without knowing DE, how can I find CE?

Wait, but from the problem, maybe CE can be found using the cyclic quadrilateral condition.

Wait, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which might give us some geometric constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps using similar triangles or the British flag theorem, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe using coordinate geometry again, but correctly this time.

Let me try again with the initial placement where ABCD is A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). So DC is from D(0,16) to C(107,16). So the line y=16.

Points E and F are on this line, E to the left of D, F to the right of C.

So E is at (e,16), e <0, F is at (f,16), f>107.

EF=184, so f -e=184.

Rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. So FG is perpendicular to EF, so vertical.

From F(f,16), moving up or down 17 units to G(f,16±17).

Similarly, from E(e,16), moving up or down 17 units to H(e,16±17).

Now, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,16±17), G(f,16±17) lie on a circle.

Case 1: Both H and G are above EF, so H(e,33), G(f,33).

So four points: A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,33), G(f,33).

As before, the circle equation.

We can set up the equations as done earlier.

But earlier, this led to x=3, which is to the right of D, which is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct setup is that H is above and G is below, but that complicates.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle passes through A, D, H, G, which are A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,33), G(f,33).

Wait, maybe using the cyclic quadrilateral condition, the power of point E with respect to the circle.

Alternatively, perhaps using the property that the cross product is zero.

Wait, another approach: The condition that four points lie on a circle can be checked using the cyclic quadrilateral condition, that opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, but that might not be straightforward here.

Alternatively, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the power of point E with respect to this circle can be used.

Wait, point E is at (e,16). Since E is on the line y=16, which is the line DC.

The power of point E with respect to the circle is |EA| * |ED| = |EH| * |EG|.

Wait, no, the power of a point E with respect to a circle is equal to the product of the lengths from E to the points of intersection with the circle along any line through E.

In this case, line EH and EG are two points on the circle, but perhaps that's not the right line.

Wait, perhaps the power of point E with respect to the circle is equal to EH * EK, where K is another intersection point, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the power of a point:

Power(E) = (distance from E to center)^2 - r^2.

But since E is on the line y=16, and the circle passes through A, D, H, G, perhaps we can find the equation of the circle and compute the power.

But this might be complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to use coordinate geometry again, but more carefully.

Let me try to find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,33), G(f,33).

As before, the general equation is x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0.

Since A(0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 → c=0.

So equation becomes x² + y² +2gx +2fy=0.

Plug in D(0,16):

0 + 256 +0 +32f=0 → 32f= -256 → f= -8.

So equation is x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Now, plug in H(e,33):

e² + 33² +2g e -16*33=0 → e² +1089 +2g e -528=0 → e² +2g e +561=0 ... (1)

Similarly, plug in G(f,33):

f² +1089 +2g f -528=0 → f² +2g f +561=0 ... (2)

So both e and f satisfy the same quadratic equation: t² +2g t +561=0.

So, e and f are roots of t² +2g t +561=0.

So, sum of roots: e + f= -2g.

Product: e*f=561.

Also, from EF=184: f -e=184.

So, we have:

e + f= -2g ... (3)

f -e=184 ... (4)

From (3) and (4):

Adding: 2f= -2g +184 → f= (-g +92) ... (5)

Subtracting: 2e= -2g -184 → e= (-g -92) ... (6)

Now, product e*f=561.

Substitute e= -g -92, f= -g +92.

So,

(-g -92)*(-g +92)=561 → (g +92)(g -92)=561 → g² - (92)^2=561 → g²=561 +8464=9025 → g=95 or g=-95.

Case 1: g=95

Then,

f= -95 +92= -3

e= -95 -92= -187

But f= -3, which is to the left of D(0,16), which contradicts F being to the right of C(107,16). So invalid.

Case 2: g=-95

Then,

f=95 +92=187

e=95 -92=3

So f=187, which is >107, valid.

e=3, which is to the right of D(0,16), which contradicts E being to the left of D. So invalid.

Hmm, this suggests that the assumption that H and G are above EF leads to E being to the right, which is invalid.

So perhaps the correct case is that H and G are below EF at y=-1.

So, H is at (e,-1), G at (f,-1).

Now, four points on circle: A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,-1), G(f,-1).

Equation of circle: x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0.

A(0,0): c=0.

So equation becomes x² + y² +2gx +2fy=0.

Plug in D(0,16):

0 +256 +0 +32f=0 → f= -8.

So equation: x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Now, plug in H(e,-1):

e² +1 +2g e -(-16)=0 → e² +2g e +17=0 ... (1)

Plug in G(f,-1):

f² +1 +2g f -(-16)=0 → f² +2g f +17=0 ... (2)

So, e and f are roots of t² +2g t +17=0.

Sum: e + f= -2g ... (3)

Product: e*f=17 ... (4)

Also, EF=184: f -e=184 ... (5)

So,

From (3): e + f= -2g

From (5): f -e=184

Adding (3) and (5):

2f= -2g +184 → f= (-g +92) ... (6)

Subtracting (5) from (3):

2e= -2g -184 → e= (-g -92) ... (7)

Product e*f=17.

Substitute (6) and (7):

e= -g -92

f= -g +92

So,

(-g -92)*(-g +92)=17 → (g +92)(g -92)=17 → g² -92²=17 → g²=17 +8464=8481 → g= sqrt(8481)=92.05 (approx)

So,

f= -g +92= -92.05 +92= -0.05

e= -g -92= -92.05 -92= -184.05

So E is at (e,16)= (-184.05,16), which is far to the left of D(0,16), correct.

F is at (f,16)= (-0.05,16), which is just to the left of D, but should be to the right of C(107,16). So this is invalid.

Hmm, this suggests that there's no solution with H and G below EF, because F ends up on the wrong side.

So perhaps the only possible case is that E is to the right of D, which contradicts the problem statement. But the problem statement says D, E, C, F are collinear, with E and F on the line. So maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. Wait, but then E would not be to the left of D.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement: "D,E,C,F are collinear." It doesn't specify the order. So perhaps the order is D, E, C, F from left to right. So D is at (0,16), E is to the right of D, then C at (107,16), then F further to the right.

In this case, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

So line is D(0,16) -> E -> C(107,16) -> F.

Then, EF=184 would mean that F is at (107 +184,16)= (291,16).

But then, from E to F is 184 units, so E is at (0 + (107 - x),16), but perhaps the placement is different.

Wait, in this case, E is between D and C, so E is at (e,16), where 0 < e <107, and F is at (e +184,16).

But then, since C is at (107,16), F would be at (e +184,16), which must be beyond C, so e +184 >107 → e > -77, which is always true since e>0.

Now, in this scenario, from E(e,16), moving to F(e+184,16), then FG=17 would be vertical.

So from F, moving up or down 17 units to G(e+184,16±17).

Similarly, from E(e,16), moving up or down 17 units to H(e,16±17).

Now, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,16±17), G(e+184,16±17) lie on a circle.

Wait, perhaps this is possible.

Let me try with H and G above EF at y=33.

So H(e,33), G(e+184,33).

Now, four points: A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,33), G(e+184,33).

Let me find the equation of the circle passing through these points.

Using general equation: x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0.

Plug in A(0,0): c=0.

So equation becomes x² + y² +2gx +2fy=0.

Plug in D(0,16): 0 +256 +0 +32f=0 → f= -8.

So equation: x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Now, plug in H(e,33):

e² +1089 +2g e -528=0 → e² +2g e +561=0 ... (1)

Plug in G(e+184,33):

(e+184)^2 +1089 +2g(e+184) -528=0 → e² +368e + 184² +1089 +2g e + 368g -528=0.

Simplify:

e² +2g e + (368e + (184)^2 +1089 -528 +368g)=0.

But from equation (1), e² +2g e = -561.

So,

-561 +368e + (33856) +1089 -528 +368g=0.

Compute constants: 33856 +1089=34945; 34945 -528=34417.

So,

-561 +368e +34417 +368g=0 → 368e +368g=561 -34417= -33856.

Divide both sides by 368:

e +g= -33856 /368= -92.

So e +g= -92 ... (2)

From equation (1): e² +2g e +561=0.

We can write this as e² +2g e = -561.

But e +g= -92 → g= -92 -e.

Substitute into equation (1):

e² +2*(-92 -e)*e = -561 → e² -184e -2e² = -561 → -e² -184e = -561 → e² +184e -561=0.

Solve for e:

e = [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*561)] /2.

Compute discriminant:

184^2=33856; 4*561=2244 → total=33856+2244=36100.

sqrt(36100)=190.

So,

e= [-184 ±190]/2.

Two cases:

Case 1: e=( -184 +190 )/2=6/2=3.

Case 2: e=( -184 -190 )/2= (-374)/2= -187.

Now, since E is between D(0,16) and C(107,16), e must be between 0 and 107. So e=3 is valid, e=-187 is invalid.

So e=3.

Then, g= -92 -e= -92 -3= -95.

So, equation of the circle is x² + y² +2*(-95)x -16y=0 → x² + y² -190x -16y=0.

Now, check if G(e+184,33)= (3+184,33)= (187,33) lies on this circle.

Plug in (187,33):

187² +33² -190*187 -16*33.

Compute:

187²=34969; 33²=1089; 190*187=35530; 16*33=528.

So,

34969 +1089 -35530 -528 = ?

34969 +1089=36058

35530 +528=36058

So, 36058 -36058=0. So yes, G lies on the circle.

Thus, this configuration is valid.

So, E is at (3,16), F at (187,16). So CE is the distance from C(107,16) to E(3,16).

Since they are on the same horizontal line, distance is |107 -3|=104.

So, CE=104.


To solve the problem, we place the rectangles in a coordinate system and use the given conditions to determine the positions of points E and F. We find that the length of CE is 104 units.

$\boxed{104}$
