Okay, so Iâ€™ve got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \)."

Hmm, so I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, once I find that \( p \), I need to find the smallest \( m \) where \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let me start by understanding the problem better. I know that if \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \), then \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). That seems like a key point. So \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). This implies that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \mod p^2 \) because if I square both sides, \( (n^4)^2 \equiv (-1)^2 = 1 \mod p^2 \). So the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must divide 8. But I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful.

Wait, maybe I should look for primes \( p \) where the equation \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution. Because if it doesn't have a solution modulo \( p \), then it certainly can't have a solution modulo \( p^2 \). So the first step is to find primes \( p \) where \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) is solvable.

I remember that for a prime \( p \), the equation \( x^k \equiv a \mod p \) has a solution depending on whether \( a \) is a power residue. Specifically, \( -1 \) is a quartic residue modulo \( p \) if and only if \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \). Let me double-check that. 

Yes, I think that's correct. Because the multiplicative group modulo \( p \) is cyclic of order \( p-1 \), so the equation \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution only if \( -1 \) is in the subgroup of 4th powers. Since \( -1 \) has order 2, for it to be a 4th power, 2 must divide the order of the group divided by the gcd of 4 and the group order. So \( p-1 \) must be divisible by 8, I believe. Wait, no, that might not be the exact condition. Let me think.

The multiplicative group mod \( p \) is cyclic of order \( p-1 \). So, the equation \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution only if the order of \( -1 \) modulo \( p \) divides \( (p-1)/\gcd(4, p-1) \). The order of \( -1 \) is 2, so 2 must divide \( (p-1)/\gcd(4, p-1) \). So for this to hold, \( (p-1)/\gcd(4, p-1) \) must be even, meaning that \( p-1 \) must be divisible by 4 or 2. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, another approach: since \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) implies that \( x^8 \equiv 1 \mod p \). So the order of \( x \) modulo \( p \) divides 8. But the multiplicative group has
