Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then determine r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the boxes are rectangular, so they have length, width, and height—let's call them x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume is xyz = 23.

So, I have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

And I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's diameter has to be at least as large as the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box. The space diagonal of a box with sides x, y, z is √(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius of the sphere would be half of that, which is (1/2)√(x² + y² + z²). So, to minimize the radius, I need to minimize the space diagonal, which in turn means minimizing x² + y² + z².

So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum value of x² + y² + z² given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, how do I approach this? I remember that for optimization problems with constraints, Lagrange multipliers can be used, but since this is likely an algebra problem, maybe I can express variables in terms of each other.

Alternatively, I can use the method of symmetric functions. Let me think. The variables x, y, z are the roots of some cubic equation. If I denote s = x + y + z, p = xy + yz + xz = 27, and q = xyz = 23.

Wait, but we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of s and p. Because x² + y² + z² = s² - 2p. So, x² + y² + z² = s² - 2*27 = s² - 54.

So, if I can find s, then I can find x² + y² + z². Therefore, to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize s², since subtracting 54 is a constant.

But how to find s? Hmm, perhaps I can use AM ≥ GM or other inequalities. But wait, with the given constraints, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers after all. Let me try that.

Let me set up the function to minimize: f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz = 27 and h(x,y,z
