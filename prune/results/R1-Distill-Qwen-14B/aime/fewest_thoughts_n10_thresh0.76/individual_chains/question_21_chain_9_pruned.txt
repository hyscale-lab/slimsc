Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me try to understand what a b-eautiful integer is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n must be a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

So, to rephrase, for a base b, we need to find all two-digit numbers in base b such that the sum of their digits equals the square root of the number. And we need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers.

First, let me figure out how two-digit numbers look in base b. A two-digit number in base b is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. So, a is at least 1, and both a and c are less than b. So, a ranges from 1 to b-1, and c ranges from 0 to b-1.

The number n can be written as n = a * b + c. The sum of the digits is a + c. The condition given is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, substituting n, we get:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c

Let's rearrange the equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it or find another way.

Alternatively, since n is a perfect square because sqrt(n) is an integer (as a + c is an integer). So, n must be a perfect square. So, for each base b, I can look at all two-digit numbers in base b, which are perfect squares, and check if the sum of their digits equals the square root.

But that might be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a relationship between a, b, and c.

Wait, let's think about the equation again:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Let me write it as:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Rearranged:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

a^2 + (2c - b) * a + (c^2 - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a, given c and b.

But since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, perhaps for each base b, I can iterate through possible c values and solve for a. Or maybe for each possible a and c, check if the equation holds.

Alternatively, maybe I can express b in terms of a and c.

From the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Rearranged:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Simplify numerator:

(a + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2

So,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

Simplify term by term:

= (
