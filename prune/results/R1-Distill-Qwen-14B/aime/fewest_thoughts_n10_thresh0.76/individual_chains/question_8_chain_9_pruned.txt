Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to break this down.

First, the first condition is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. That means each of them can range from 0 up to 300, but of course, their sum must be exactly 300. Now, the second condition is a bit more complex. It looks like a symmetric expression involving squares and products of the variables. Maybe I can factor this or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Let me write out the second equation more clearly:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I notice that this can be factored by grouping terms. Let me see: take a²b + a²c, which is a²(b + c), and similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me try that.

So substituting, the expression becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly for the others.

So the entire equation is:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can divide both sides by 300 to make it a bit simpler:

(a² + b² + c²) - (1/300)(a³ + b³ + c³) = 20,000.

Wait, that fraction might complicate things. Maybe it's better to keep it as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me think about whether I can relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ to the sum a + b + c, which is 300.

I remember that there are formulas that relate these sums. For example, we can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, and abc.

Similarly, a² + b² + c² can be expressed in terms of (a + b + c)² and ab + bc + ca.

Let me write down those relations.

First, (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So that means:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Calculating 300²: that's 90,000.

So a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Next, for a³ + b³ + c³, the formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Let me compute that:

(a + b + c)³ = 300³ = 27,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Now, let's plug these expressions back into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting each term:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)):

= 300*90,000 - 300*2(ab + bc + ca)
= 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca).

Then, subtract [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc]:

= 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Simplify terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600(ab + bc + ca) + 900(ab + bc + ca) = 300(ab + bc + ca).

So now we have:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So, the equation reduces to:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's a nicer equation. Now, let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca.

So, from the equation:

100
