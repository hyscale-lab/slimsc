Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since z is a complex number and |z| = 4, I can represent z in its polar form. That might make things easier when dealing with multiplication and division. So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That makes sense because the modulus is 4, and the exponential form captures both modulus and argument.

Now, substituting z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression, let's see what we get.

The first term is (75 + 117i)z. So that becomes (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

The second term is (96 + 144i)/z. Since z = 4e^{iθ}, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, so this term becomes (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, putting it all together, the expression is:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (75 + 117i) * 4. That's 75*4 + 117i*4 = 300 + 468i.

Similarly, (96 + 144i) * (1/4) is (96/4) + (144/4)i = 24 + 36i.

So now the expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm, that's better. Now, I can express each term using Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

Let me distribute each term:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Let me compute each part separately.

Starting with the first term:
(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:
300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Now, group the real and imaginary parts:
Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

Similarly, for the second term:
(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so it becomes:
24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary part: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

Now, add the two real parts and the two imaginary parts together.

Real parts combined:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts combined:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So the entire expression is:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)

But the problem asks for the largest possible real part of this expression. So we focus on the real part: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. To find the maximum of an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, we can use the formula that the maximum is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait no, actually, it's A cosθ + B sinθ = C cos(θ - φ), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and tanφ = B/A. So the maximum value is indeed C, which is sqrt(A² + B²).

But wait, in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ. So A = 324, B = -432.

So, the maximum value of Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Let me compute that.

First, 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300² = 90,000, and 24²=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14,400. So (300+24)² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400²=160,000, 32²=1,024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So (400+32)² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Let's see, 540 squared is 291,600 because 500²=250,000, 540² = (500+40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 + 40² = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) is 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check because sometimes I might mix up the signs or the formula. Our expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So in the formula, A is 324, B is -432. So when calculating sqrt(A² + B²), it's sqrt(324² + (-432)^2), which is indeed sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. So that's correct.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure that the expression's real part is indeed 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me retrace my steps.

We had (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.
