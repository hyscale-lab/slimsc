Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, starting from the lower left corner and ending at the upper right corner. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me understand the grid. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So, to move from the lower left to the upper right, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. That makes sense. So, each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves, totaling 16 steps. The number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for either direction. So, that's C(16,8), which is 12,870. But we need paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction exactly four times—what does that mean? Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, the number of direction changes corresponds to the number of times the path switches between R and U.

Let me think. If a path changes direction k times, how does that relate to the number of runs of R's and U's? A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, each direction change starts a new run. For example, if a path starts with R, then U, then R again, that's two direction changes, resulting in three runs: R, U, R.

Wait, no. Wait, if you have a path with four direction changes, that would mean the path alternates between R and U five times. So, the number of runs is one more than the number of direction changes. So, four direction changes mean five runs.

So, if I have four direction changes, the path alternates between R and U a total of five times. So, the path could start with R, then U, R, U, R, U, R, U, but wait, that's four direction changes and five runs. Alternatively, it could start with U, R, U, R, U, R, U, R, but again, four direction changes and five runs.

Wait, but for our grid, we start at the lower left and end at the upper right. So, the first step must be either right or up. If the path starts with R, then the next direction is U, and so on, alternating. Similarly, if it starts with U, it alternates the other way. Either way, the number of runs is five.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of such paths that have exactly five runs, alternating between R and U, starting with either R or U. And each run must consist of at least one step, since you can't have a run of zero steps.

Wait, but each run has to have at least one step. So, for each starting direction, I need to calculate the number of ways to partition the 8 R's and 8 U's into five runs, alternating between R and U.

Let me think more carefully. Suppose the path starts with R. Then the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. Wait, that's five runs, starting and ending with R. Each R run must have at least one R, and each U run must have at least one U.

So, in this case, the number of R runs is three, and U runs is two. Wait, no. Wait, starting with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, there are three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, if starting with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U, which is three U runs and two R runs.

So, for each case, whether starting with R or U, the number of runs is five, with three runs of one direction and two runs of the other.

Let me formalize this. Let’s denote starting with R: runs = R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, starting with U: runs = U, R, U, R, U. Three U runs and two R runs.

Since the total number of R steps is 8 and U steps is 8, for the starting with R case:

We need to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs, each run at least 1. Similarly, distribute 8 U's into 2 runs, each at least 1.

Similarly, starting with U, distribute 8 U's into 3 runs and 8 R's into 2 runs.

So, the number of ways for each starting direction can be calculated using stars and bars.

For the starting with R case:

Number of ways to distribute R's: C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Number of ways to distribute U's: C(8-1, 2-1) = C
