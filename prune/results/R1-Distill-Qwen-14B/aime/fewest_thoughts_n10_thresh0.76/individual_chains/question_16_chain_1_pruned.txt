Okay, so I have this problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I think I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I find that p, then I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue play a role here. That is, primes p where the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Because if such a solution exists, then p divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. But since we're dealing with p², it's not just about whether p divides it, but whether p² does.

So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p such that p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Let me list some small primes and check their conditions.

Starting with p=2: Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ modulo 4. For n odd, n is 1 mod 2, so n⁴ is 1 mod 4, so n⁴ +1 is 2 mod 4, which isn't 0. For n even, n is 0 mod 2, so n⁴ is 0 mod 4, so n⁴ +1 is 1 mod 4, again not 0. So 2²=4 doesn't divide any n⁴ +1. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3: Let's check if there exists an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. So, n⁴ ≡ 8 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 repeats every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9 → 1
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: 256 mod9= (256-27*9)=256-243=13→13 mod9=4
n=5: 625 mod9: 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4 →4. Hmm, same as 4?
Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, 4⁴ is 256, 256 mod9: 2+5+6=13→4. No, wait, that's the digital root, but actually 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So yes, 4.

n=5: 5⁴=625. 625 mod9: 625 - 69*9=625-621=4. So same as 4.

n=6: 6 is 0 mod9, 6⁴=0 mod9.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7. So 2401 mod9=7.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: Let's sum the digits: 4+0+9+6=19→10→1. Wait, that can't be right. Let's compute 4096/9: 9*455=4095, so 4096 mod9=1.

Wait, that seems inconsistent. Let me compute more carefully:

n=7: n=7 mod9. So 7²=49≡4 mod9. Then 7⁴=(7²)²=4²=16≡7 mod9.

n=8: 8 mod9. 8²=64≡1 mod9. So 8⁴=(8²)²=1²=1 mod9.

So the residues for n⁴ mod9 are:

n=1:1, n=2:7, n=3:0, n=4:4, n=5:4, n=6:0, n=7:7, n=8:1.

Looking for n⁴ ≡8 mod9. But in the residues above, the
