Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then line AD intersects ω again at point P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. Hmm, okay.

First, I should probably sketch the figure to visualize everything. So triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D, forming the point outside the circle. Then AD intersects ω again at P.

I remember that tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So DB and DC should be equal since they're both tangents from D to ω. That might come in handy later.

I think I need to find some lengths or angles in this triangle to find AP. Maybe I can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or power of a point. Let me recall, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Because D lies outside the circle, and AD is a secant that intersects ω at A and P, so the power of D would be DA * DP = DB².

So if I can find DB, then I can relate it to DA and DP. But I don't know DA yet. Wait, maybe I can find DB first.

But how? Let me think. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle with DB = DC. Also, the line OD (O is the center of ω) is the angle bisector of angle BDC because D is equidistant from B and C.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find coordinates for everything. Maybe place the triangle in a coordinate system to calculate the necessary points. Let me consider that approach.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, since AC is 10, let me place point A at (10,0). Now, point B is somewhere in the plane. Given that AB=5 and BC=9, I can find the coordinates of B.

Let me denote point B as (x, y). Then, the distance from A to B is 5, so:

√[(x - 10)² + y²] = 5 → (x -10)² + y² = 25 ...(1)

Distance from B to C is 9:

√[x² + y²] = 9 → x² + y² = 81 ...(2)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

(x -10)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81 → x² -20x +100 + y² - x² - y² = -56 → -20x +100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x
