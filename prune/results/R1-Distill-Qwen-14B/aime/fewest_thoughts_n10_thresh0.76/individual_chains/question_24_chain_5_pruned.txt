Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in a list that has some specific properties. Let me try to break it down and think it through step by step.

First, let's list out the properties again to make sure I don't miss anything:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And my goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in this list.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by understanding each property one by one and see how they can help me figure out what the list looks like.

Starting with the mode. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list, and it's unique, so no other number can appear as many times as 9. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. That gives me a starting point.

Next, the sum of all the numbers is 30. So, whatever list I come up with, when I add all the numbers together, it should equal 30.

The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting. So, the median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order, but it's not one of the actual numbers in the list. That means the list has an even number of elements because if it were odd, the median would be the middle number, which would have to be in the list. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Wait, let me think again. If the list has an odd number of elements, say 5, then the median is the 3rd element, which is in the list. But in this problem, the median is not in the list, so that suggests that the list has an even number of elements. Because for even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But wait, the median is a positive integer, so the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer, and that integer must not be present in the list. So, that gives me some constraints on the two middle numbers.

So, let's consider the list must have an even number of elements because, otherwise, the median would be one of the numbers in the list. So, the length of the list, n, is even. Let's denote n as 2k, where k is an integer. So, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements.

So, the median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, where a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_{2k} are the numbers in the list arranged in order.

And this median is an integer, let's call it m, and m is not in the list. So, m is an integer, and the two middle numbers, a_k and a_{k+1}, must add up to 2m.

So, a_k + a_{k+1} = 2m.

Also, m is not in the list, so m is different
