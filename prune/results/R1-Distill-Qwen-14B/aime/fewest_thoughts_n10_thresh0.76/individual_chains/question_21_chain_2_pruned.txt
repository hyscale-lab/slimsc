Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the problem is about finding the least integer base \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers. 

First, let me make sure I understand what a \( b \)-eautiful number is. The problem says a positive integer \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When \( n \) is written in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of \( n \).

So, breaking it down, if a number \( n \) is represented as \( \underline{d_1}\underline{d_0}_b \) in base \( b \), then:
- \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \)
- \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \)

Also, since it's a two-digit number in base \( b \), \( d_1 \) must be at least 1 (since leading zeros aren't allowed) and less than \( b \). Similarly, \( d_0 \) must be between 0 and \( b-1 \).

So, the first thing I should do is express \( n \) in terms of \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \), and then relate that to the sum \( d_1 + d_0 \).

Given:
\( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \)
and
\( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \).

If I square both sides of the second equation, I get:
\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = n \)
But \( n \) is also equal to \( d_1 b + d_0 \). So substituting:
\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Let me write this equation clearly:
\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Let me expand the left-hand side:
\( d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can rearrange terms to make it more manageable. Let's move everything to one side:
\( d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 - d_1 b - d_0 = 0 \)

Let me group like terms:
- Terms with \( d_1^2 \): \( d_1^2 \)
- Terms with \( d_1 d_0 \): \( 2 d_1 d_0 \)
- Terms with \( d_0^2 \): \( d_0^2 \)
- Terms with \( d_1 \): \( -d_1 b \)
- Terms with \( d_0 \): \( -d_0 \)

So, the equation is:
\( d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 - d_1 b - d_0 = 0 \)

Hmm, perhaps factor this differently or find a way to express \( b \) in terms of \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \). Let me try that.

Starting from the equation:
\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Let me solve for \( b \):
\( d_1 b = (d_1 + d_0)^2 - d_0 \)
So,
\( b = \frac{(d_1 + d_0)^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

Simplify numerator:
\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 - d_0 = d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0 \)
So,
\( b = \frac{d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

Let me separate the terms:
\( b = \frac{d_1^2}{d_1} + \frac{2 d_1 d_0}{d_1} + \frac{d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)
Simplify each term:
\( b = d_1 + 2 d_0 + \frac{d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

So,
\( b = d_1 + 2 d_0 + \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \)

Since \( b \) must be an integer, this expression must result in an integer value. Therefore, \( \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \) must be an integer. Let me denote this term as \( k = \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \), which must be an integer.

So, \( k = \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \) must be integer.

Therefore, \( d_1 \) must divide \( d_0(d_0 - 1) \). 

Also, considering the digits:
- \( d_1 \) is from 1 to \( b - 1 \)
- \( d_0 \) is from 0 to \( b - 1 \)
But in the two-digit number, \( d_1 \) must be at least 1, and \( d_0 \) can be 0.

Moreover, since \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \), and \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \), let's see what constraints we can get on \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \).

Firstly, \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{d_1 b + d_0} \). Let me square both sides:
\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)
Which is the same as earlier.

Given that \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) are digits, their values are limited. So perhaps I can consider possible values of \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) that satisfy the condition \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0(d_0 - 1) \), and then compute \( b \) accordingly.

But perhaps instead, for a given base \( b \), I can find all pairs \( (d_1, d_0) \) such that:

1. \( d_1 \) is from 1 to \( b - 1 \)
2. \( d_0 \) is from 0 to \( b - 1 \)
3. \( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

And count how many such pairs exist for each \( b \), then find the smallest \( b \) where the count is more than ten.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express \( b \) in terms of \( s = d_1 + d_0 \) and see what possible values come up.

Let me let \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), so \( s = \sqrt{n} \). Then \( n = s^2 \). But \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \), so \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \).

Also, since \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), we can write \( d_0 = s - d_1 \). Substituting into the equation:

\( s^2 = d_1 b + (s - d_1) \)
Simplify:
\( s^2 = d_1 b + s - d_1 \)
\( s^2 - s = d_1 (b - 1) \)
So, \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \)

Since \( d_1 \) must be a positive integer (digit) and \( d_1 \leq b - 1 \), this equation gives a condition on \( s \) and \( b \). 

Moreover, \( d_1 \) must be at least 1, so \( s^2 - s \geq b - 1 \)
But since \( d_1 \leq b -1 \), \( \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \leq b -1 \)
So, \( s^2 - s \leq (b -1)^2 \)

Alternatively, let's solve for \( b \) in the equation:

\( b - 1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{d_1} \)
So, \( b = 1 + \frac{s^2 - s}{d_1} \)

Since \( b \) must be an integer, \( d_1 \) must divide \( s^2 - s \).

So, for each possible \( s \), and each possible divisor \( d_1 \) of \( s^2 - s \), we can compute \( b \), and then check if \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) is a valid digit in base \( b \), meaning \( 0 \leq d_0 \leq b -1 \).

Moreover, since \( d_1 \) is a digit in base \( b \), \( d_1 \) must be less than \( b \), which is already considered because \( b = 1 + \frac{s^2 - s}{d_1} \). So, \( d_1 < b \) implies \( d_1 < 1 + \frac{s^2 - s}{d_1} \), which is equivalent to \( d_1^2 < s^2 - s + d_1 \), but this might be more complicated than I thought.

Alternatively, let me consider that for a given \( b \), \( s \) must satisfy certain conditions.

Each \( b \) can be written as \( b = 1 + \frac{s^2 - s}{d_1} \). So for each \( s \), \( d_1 \) must be a divisor of \( s^2 - s \), and then \( b \)
