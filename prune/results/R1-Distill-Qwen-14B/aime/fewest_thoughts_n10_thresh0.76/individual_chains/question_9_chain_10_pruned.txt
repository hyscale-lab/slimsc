Okay, so I've got this problem here: there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but let's see. Maybe I can start by writing down the given equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Wait, logarithms have properties that let me bring exponents outside. So, for the first equation, log_x(y^x) can be simplified. Since log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a), so this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) is 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10

2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). That might be useful here.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So substituting into the equations:

Equation 1: x * A = 10

Equation 2: 4y * (1/A) = 10

So now I have:

x = 10 / A, from equation 1.

And 4y / A = 10, so 4y = 10A => y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2.

So now I have x in terms of A and y in terms of A. Maybe I can express one in terms of the other.

But wait, I also know that A is log_x(y). Let's express A in terms of x and y.

Since A = log_x(y), which means x^A = y.

So, y = x^A.

But from earlier, y = (5A)/2. So,

x^A = (5A)/2.

But x is 10 / A, so substituting:

(10 / A)^A = (5A)/2.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me write that again.

(10 / A)^A = (5A)/2.

This looks messy. Maybe I can take natural logs on both sides to make it easier.

Taking ln on both sides:

A * ln(10 / A) = ln( (5A)/2 )

Simplify the left side:

A * (ln(10) - ln(A)) = ln(5A) - ln(2).

Hmm, let's expand both sides:

Left side: A ln(10) - A ln(A)

Right side: ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

So, bringing all terms to one side:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) - ln(5) - ln(A) + ln(2) = 0
