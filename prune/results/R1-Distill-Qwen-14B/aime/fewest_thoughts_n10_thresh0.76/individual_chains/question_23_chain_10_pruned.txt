Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about points A, B, C, and D on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral where all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at 90 degrees. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A, B, C, D are points on the hyperbola, their diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint.

So, if I can model the coordinates of these points, perhaps I can express them in terms of variables and then use the hyperbola equation to find constraints.

Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are bisected there, if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D would be (-p, -q). So, this makes sense because the diagonals are AC and BD, each connecting a point to its opposite such that the origin is the midpoint.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. That is, AB = BC = CD = DA. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in terms of the diagonals.

Wait, but maybe another approach is better. Let me think in terms of vectors or coordinates.

Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the product of their slopes should be -1. But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, their midpoints are at the origin.

So, the diagonals are AC and BD. The slope of AC would be (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD would be (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p.

Since they are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. So, (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. Therefore, (yq)/(xp) = -1. So, yq = -xp.

Okay, so that's one condition.

Now, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, substituting their coordinates into the equation:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Similarly, for point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

And since C and D are just negatives of A and B, they also satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, that's good.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on. But maybe it's easier to use vectors or use the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and the sides are equal.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors would be better. Let me denote vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Then, since ABCD is a rhombus, vectors OA and OB satisfy |OA + OB| = |OA - OB|, because the sides AB and AD must be equal.

Wait, let me think. If A is (x, y) and B is (p, q), then vector AB is (p - x, q - y). Similarly, vector AD would be (-p - x, -q - y). Since it's a rhombus, |AB| = |AD|.

Calculating |AB|²: (p - x)² + (q - y)².

Calculating |AD|²: (-p - x)² + (-q - y)² = (p + x)² + (q + y)².

Setting them equal:

(p - x)² + (q - y)² = (p + x)² + (q + y)².

Expanding both sides:

Left: p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y².

Right: p² + 2px + x² + q² + 2qy + y².

Subtracting right from left:

(-4px - 4qy) = 0.

So, -4px -4qy = 0 → -px - qy = 0 → px + qy = 0.

So, that's another condition: px + qy = 0.

Earlier, we had from the slopes: yq = -xp → yq + xp = 0. So, same as px + qy = 0. So, that's consistent.

So, so far, we have two conditions:

1. yq = -xp (from the slopes being perpendicular)
2. px + qy = 0 (from the equal sides)

Wait, these are the same equation. So, that gives me only one condition, which is px + qy = 0.

So, that's one equation, but we have other constraints as well because points A and B lie on the hyperbola.

So, let's write down the equations:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

For point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Also, from the condition of the diagonals being perpendicular, px + qy = 0.

So, now, we have three equations:
