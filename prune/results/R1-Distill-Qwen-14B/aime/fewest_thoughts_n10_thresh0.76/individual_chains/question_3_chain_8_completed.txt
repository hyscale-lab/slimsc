Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand it.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen 4. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize, because if you win the grand prize, you definitely have at least two numbers matching. So actually, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the probability we're looking for is P(A)/P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize and B is the event of winning a prize.

So first, let's define:

- A: Jen wins the grand prize. This means all four of her numbers are chosen.
- B: Jen wins a prize. This means at least two of her numbers are chosen.

So, we need to compute P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

I think the problem will be easier if we compute the number of possible lottery draws and the number of favorable cases for both A and B.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is 210. So, that's the denominator for all probabilities.

Now, let's compute P(A). For the grand prize, all four of Jen's numbers must be chosen. Since she picks 4 numbers, and 4 are drawn, there's only 1 favorable outcome for A: the 4 numbers she picked are exactly the 4 drawn. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, compute P(B). B is the event that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. To find this, it's easier to compute the probability of the complementary event (i.e., fewer than two numbers are chosen) and subtract from 1.

So, the complementary event is that 0 or 1 of Jen's numbers are chosen.

- Number of ways to choose 0 numbers from Jen's 4: C(4,0) = 1. Then, the remaining 4 numbers must come from the other 6 numbers not chosen by Jen. So, the number of ways is C(6,4) = 15.

- Number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4: C(4,1) = 4. Then, the remaining 3 numbers come from the other 6, so C(6,3) = 20. So, total for 1 number is 4 * 20 = 80.

So, total number of ways for complementary event (0 or 1) is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways for event B (at least 2) is total ways minus complementary: 210 - 95 = 115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me verify that. So, 210 total possible draws. 95 have 0 or 1 of Jen's numbers, so 210 - 95 = 115 have at least 2. That seems correct.

So, P(B) = 115/210.

Now, P(A) is 1/210. So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.

So, the number of favorable for A is 1. The number of favorable for B is 115. So, the probability is 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115, which are coprime. So, m + n is 116. Is that right?

Wait a second, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of favorable cases for B.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the number of possible draws where at least two of Jen's numbers are present, which is the same as the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two from Jen's 4.

So, another way to compute that is to sum the number of ways to choose exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 of Jen's numbers.

So, exactly 2: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Exactly 4: C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So, total for B is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So that's the same as before. So, yes, 115.

So, that part is correct.

So, the probability of A given B is 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, since 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with them.

Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but I just thought, is there another way this could be approached? Maybe using combinations.

Alternatively, think about the conditional probability formula. So, P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B). But since A is a subset of B (if you have 4 matching numbers, you certainly have at least two), then P(A and B) is just P(A). So, this gives the same result: 1/115.

So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 116.


To determine the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, we use conditional probability. Let \( A \) be the event of winning the grand prize, and \( B \) be the event of winning a prize. We need to find \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \).

1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

2. **Probability of Winning the Grand Prize (\( P(A) \))**: There is only 1 favorable outcome where all four numbers match, so \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

3. **Probability of Winning a Prize (\( P(B) \))**: This is the probability of at least two numbers matching. We calculate the complementary probability (0 or 1 numbers matching) and subtract from 1.
   - **0 numbers matching**: \( \binom{4}{0} \binom{6}{4} = 1 \times 15 = 15 \).
   - **1 number matching**: \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).
   - Total complementary outcomes: \( 15 + 80 = 95 \).
   - Favorable outcomes for \( B \): \( 210 - 95 = 115 \).
   - Thus, \( P(B) = \frac{115}{210} \).

4. **Conditional Probability \( P(A|B) \)**: 
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]
   Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), which are coprime. Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

**Answer**: \boxed{116}
