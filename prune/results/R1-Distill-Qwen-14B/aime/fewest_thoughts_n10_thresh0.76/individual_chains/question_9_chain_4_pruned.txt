Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10 and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can use the change of base formula or some properties of logarithms to simplify these equations. Let me write down the given equations first.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Using logarithm properties, I know that log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a). So applying that here, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. 

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the same logarithm property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Okay, so now I have two equations:
1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I remember that log_b(a) is the reciprocal of log_a(b). So log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say log_y(x) = k. Then, log_x(y) would be 1/k.

Substituting into the first equation:
x * (1/k) = 10 => x = 10k.

Substituting into the second equation:
4y * k = 10 => 4yk = 10 => yk = 10/4 => yk = 5/2.

So now I have two equations in terms of x, y, and k:
1. x = 10k
2. yk = 5/2

But remember that k is log_y(x), which is log base y of x. So k = log_y(x) implies that y^k = x.

Because from the definition of logarithm, if log_y(x) = k, then y^k = x.

So now, substituting x from the first equation into this, we have y^k = 10k.

So we have y^k = 10k, and from equation 2, y = (5/2)/k.

So substitute y into y^k = 10k:

[(5/2)/k]^k = 10k.

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of k. Let me write that again:

( (5/2) / k )^k = 10k.

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln( (5/2 / k)^k ) = ln(10k).

Using the logarithm power rule, ln(a^b) = b ln(a), so:

k * ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k).

Let me write that as:

k * [ ln(5) - ln(2k) ] = ln(10k).

Expanding the left side:

k ln(5) - k ln(2k) = ln(10k).

Let's distribute the k in the second term:

k ln(5) - k (ln(2) + ln(k)) ) = ln(10) + ln(k).

Because ln(2k) = ln(2) + ln(k), and ln(10k) = ln(10) + ln(k).

So expanding further:

k ln(5) - k ln(2) - k ln(k) = ln(10) + ln(k).

Let me rearrange the terms:

[k ln(5) - k ln(2)] - k ln(k) - ln(k) - ln(10) = 0.

Factor terms with ln(k):

[k ln(5) - k ln(2) - ln(10)] - [k ln(k) + ln(k)] = 0.

Factor ln(k) from the second group:

[k ln(5) - k ln(2) - ln(10)] - ln(k)(k + 1) = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can collect like terms:

Bring all terms to one side:

k ln(5) - k ln(2) - k ln(k) - ln(k) - ln(10) = 0.

Factor out k from the first three terms:

k [ ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(k) ] - ln(k) - ln(10) = 0.

Let me see, ln(5) - ln(2) is ln(5/2), so:

k [ ln(5/2) - ln(k) ] - ln(k) - ln(10) = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor ln(5/2) and ln(k):

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me set t = ln(k). Then, k = e^t.

Let me try substituting t into the equation.

So, k = e^t.

Plugging into the equation:

e^t [ ln(5/2) - t ] - t - ln(10) = 0.

This becomes:

e^t * ln(5/2) - e^t * t - t - ln(10) = 0.

Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can rearrange it:

e^t * ln(5/2) = e^t * t + t + ln(10).

Or:

e^t (ln(5/2) - t) = t + ln(10).

This still looks complicated. Maybe I can see if there's a value of t that satisfies this equation. Let me try some integer values for t.

Wait, but t = ln(k), and k = log_y(x). Since x and y are greater than 1, k is positive. Hmm, perhaps trying t=1.

If t=1, left side: e^1 (ln(5/2) - 1) = e (ln(2.5) -1) ≈ e*(0.9163 -1) ≈ e*(-0.0837) ≈ -0.228.

Right side: 1 + ln(10) ≈ 1 + 2.3026 ≈ 3.3026.

Not equal. So t=1 not a solution.

How about t=0? If t=0, left side: e^0 (ln(5/2) -0) = 1*(ln(2.5)) ≈0.9163. Right side: 0 + ln(10)=2.3026. Not equal.

t=0.5: left side: e^0.5*(ln(2.5) -0.5) ≈1.6487*(0.9163 -0.5)=1.6487*(0.4163)≈0.686.

Right side: 0.5 + ln(10)=0.5+2.3026≈2.8026. Not equal.

t=2: left side: e^2*(ln(2.5)-2)≈7.389*(0.9163 -2)=7.389*(-1.0837)≈-8.05.

Right side:2 + 2.3026≈4.3026. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe negative t? But t = ln(k), and k is positive, so t can be any real except perhaps negative if k is less than 1. Wait, k is log_y(x). Since x and y are both greater than 1, if x > y, then log_y(x) >1, so k>1. If x < y, then k<1, so t would be negative.

But earlier, when I tried t=1, which corresponds to k=e^1≈2.718, but that didn't work. So let's try t= ln(2)≈0.693. Maybe that.

t=0.693: left side: e^0.693*(ln(2.5)-0.693). e^0.693≈2. So 2*(0.9163 -0.693)=2*(0.2233)≈0.4466.

Right side: 0.693 +2.3026≈2.9956. Not equal.

Hmm, perhaps t= ln(5/2)≈0.9163
