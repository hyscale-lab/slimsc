Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the triangle ABC. The triangle is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then line AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then I need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, when I draw AD, it intersects ω again at P. I need to find AP.

First, I think I should recall some properties of tangents and circles. Tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω. Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC. Since D is the intersection of these two tangents, triangle DBC is a right triangle at B and C? Wait, no. Because DB is tangent at B, so DB is perpendicular to OB, but DC is tangent at C, so DC is perpendicular to OC. So, actually, DB and DC are both tangents, and D is the ex-pole or something.

I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole, and there's a relation involving power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC² since DB and DC are tangents. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. Hmm, but wait, no—wait, actually, in a circle, the lengths from an external point to the points of tangency are equal. So, yes, DB = DC.

That's useful. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

But how does this help me find AP? Maybe I can use some power of a point or harmonic division or something.

Wait, let me think about the power of point D with respect to ω. The power is DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Because AD is a secant that intersects ω at A and P. So, by power of a point, DB² = DA * DP. So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then AP = AD - DP, or something like that? Wait, no, because AP is from A to P, which is on ω. So, maybe AP = DP - AD? Wait, no, AD is from A to D, and P is on AD beyond D? Wait, no, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, AD is a line from A to D. Since D is outside the circle, and AD passes through the circle at A and then exits at P. So, A is one intersection point, and P is the other. So, the power of D with respect
