Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal chance. The question is about the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem first. We have a regular octagon, so it has 8 vertices, each connected to form a regular shape. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each color with a probability of 1/2, and each vertex is colored independently. So, each vertex is like a coin flip—red or blue.

The key part is: the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red ones. So, after rotation, every blue vertex must be in a position that was red before the rotation. That means, essentially, the set of blue vertices must be a shifted version (rotated) of the set of red vertices.

Wait, maybe another way: If I have a coloring, can I rotate the octagon such that the new blue vertices align with the original red positions? So, the blue positions after rotation should exactly match the red positions before rotation.

Let me think about what that implies. Let's denote the positions of the octagon as 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 (like a clock). Each coloring is a subset of these positions where each is either red or blue. So, a coloring can be represented as a binary string of length 8, where each bit is 0 (red) or 1 (blue).

Now, the octagon can be rotated by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. Each rotation corresponds to shifting the octagon by k positions, where k is from 0 to 7. So, for a given coloring, we need to check if any of these rotations will transform the blue vertices to the original red vertices.

Wait, more precisely, if we consider the set of blue vertices as B and the set of red vertices as R, then for some rotation k, the rotated set of blue vertices B' must equal R.

But since the octagon is regular, R is the complement of B. So, R = all vertices not in B. So, B' = R implies that B' = complement of B. So, after rotation by k, the blue set maps to the red set, which is the complement of the original blue set.

So, this implies that B is a rotation of its own complement. That is, B is a set such that when you rotate it by k positions, you get the complement of B.

Hmm, okay, so we need to count the number of colorings where B is a rotation of its complement. Then the probability will be that number divided by 2^8, which is 256.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets B of the octagon's vertices such that B is a rotation of its complement. Then, the probability is that number divided by 256.

I think the key here is to consider rotational symmetries. The octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, which correspond to shifts by 0,1,2,...,7 positions.

So, for a subset B, if there exists a rotation k such that B shifted by k equals the complement of B, then this coloring satisfies the condition.

But how do we count such subsets? Maybe it's easier to consider that B is a subset such that B and its complement are in the same orbit under rotation. So, B is a subset whose complement is a rotation of B.

Wait, another thought: For a subset B, if shifting it by k positions gives the complement, then shifting it by 2k positions would give the complement shifted by k, which is B again? Or not necessarily. Let
