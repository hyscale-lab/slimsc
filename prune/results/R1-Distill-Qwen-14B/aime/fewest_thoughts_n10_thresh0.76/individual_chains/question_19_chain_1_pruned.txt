Okay, so I have this geometry problem here: Triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, let's recall some properties about triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.

The key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line segment from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the segment from O to I. That must form a right angle at point I.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me verify that. Yes, I think that's correct. Let me plug in the given values: OI = sqrt(13(13 - 2*6)) = sqrt(13*(13 -12))=sqrt(13*1)=sqrt(13). So, OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but in this case, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle AIO must be a right-angled triangle at I. That means we can apply the Pythagorean theorem here. So, in triangle AIO, AI^2 + IO^2 = AO^2.

I know AO is the circumradius, so AO = R = 13. IO we already found as sqrt(13). So, let's compute AI.

So, AI^2 + (sqrt(13))^2 = 13^2.

That simplifies to AI^2 + 13 = 169.

So, AI^2 = 169 -13 = 156. Hence, AI = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So, AI is 2*sqrt(39).

Okay, so AI is the length of the inradius from A to I. Wait, no, AI is the length from A to the incenter I. I remember that in a triangle, the length from a vertex to the inradius can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.

In particular, the formula for AI is (r)/(sin(A/2)), where r is the inradius. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. I think the distance from the inradius to a vertex involves the inradius and the angle at that vertex.

Alternatively, another formula I recall is AI = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Let me check that.

Yes, I think that's right. The distance from the vertex A to the incenter I is AI = (r)/(sin(A/2)). So, if AI is 2*sqrt(39), and r is 6, then:

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)

So, solving for sin(A/2):

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, that simplifies to sqrt(39)/13. Hmm, let me confirm:

6 divided by 2 is 3, so 3/sqrt(39). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(39) to rationalize, so 3*sqrt(39)/39. Which is sqrt(39)/13. Yes, correct.

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Now, using the identity that sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) =1, we can find cos(A/2).

So, cos^2(A/2) = 1
