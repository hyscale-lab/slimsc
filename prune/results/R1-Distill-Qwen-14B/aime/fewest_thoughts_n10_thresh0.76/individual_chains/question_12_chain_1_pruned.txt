Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0 through 9) such that when I read the two numbers formed left to right in each row, their sum is 999. Additionally, when I read the three numbers formed top to bottom in each column, their sum is 99.

Hmm, let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So each row has three digits, and each column has two digits. Let me denote the grid cells as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, the first row forms the number 100a + 10b + c, and the second row forms 100d + 10e + f. Their sum should be 999.

Similarly, each column forms a two-digit number. So the first column is 10a + d, the second is 10b + e, and the third is 10c + f. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

So, to recap:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

I need to find all possible assignments of digits a, b, c, d, e, f that satisfy these two equations.

Let me write these equations more clearly.

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm. Maybe I can manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Let me subtract equation 2 multiplied by 10 from equation 1 to see if that helps. Wait, let me see:

Wait, equation 1 is 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Equation 2 is 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

If I subtract 10 times equation 2 from equation 1, perhaps?

Let me compute 10*(equation 2):

10*(10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 100a + 10d + 100b + 10e + 100c + 10f

Now, equation 1 minus 10*(equation 2):

(100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f) - (100a +10d +100b +10e +100c +10f) = 999 - 10*99

Simplify the left side:

100a -100a + 10b -100b + c -100c +100d -10d +10e -10e +f -10f

Which simplifies to:

(0)a + (-90)b + (-99)c + (90)d + (0)e + (-9)f = 999 - 990

Because 10*99=990, so 999-990=9.

So the equation becomes:

-90b -99c +90d -9f = 9

Hmm, that's a manageable equation. Let me factor out 9:

9*(-10b -11c +10d -f) =9

Divide both sides by 9:

-10b -11c +10d -f = 1

So, equation 3: -10b -11c +10d -f =1

Okay, so now I have equation 3 and equation 2. Maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f =99

Let me rearrange equation 2:

10a +10b +10c + d + e + f =99

So, 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about that.

Similarly, equation 1: 100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f =999

Which is: 100(a + d) +10(b + e) + (c + f) =999

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of equation 3 and equation 2.

So, equation 3: -10b -11c +10d -f =1

Let me try to write f in terms of other variables.

f = -10b -11c +10d -1

Hmm, since f is a digit, it must be between 0 and 9, inclusive.

So, f = (-10b -11c +10d) -1

Therefore, (-10b -11c +10d) must be between 1 and 10, because f has to be 0-9.

So, 1 ≤ (-10b -11c +10d) ≤ 10

Because f = (expression) -1, so expression must be f +1, which is 1 to 10.

Wait, wait: f = (-10b -11c +10d) -1, so for f to be ≥0,

-10b -11c +10d -1 ≥0 → -10b -11c +10d ≥1

And for f ≤9,

-10b -11c +10d -1 ≤9 → -10b -11c +10d ≤10

So,

1 ≤ (-10b -11c +10d) ≤10

Equation 4: 1 ≤ (-10b -11c +10d) ≤10

Hmm, so I have that.

Now, going back to equation 2: 10a + d +10b + e +10c + f =99

I can substitute f from equation 3 into equation 2.

So,

10a + d +10b + e +10c + [ -10b -11c +10d -1 ] =99

Simplify:

10a + d +10b + e +10c -10b -11c +10d -1 =99

Combine like terms:

10a + (d +10d) + (10b -10b) + (10c -11c) + e -1 =99

So,

10a +11d -c + e -1 =99

Which simplifies to:

10a +11d -c + e =100

Equation 5: 10a +11d -c + e =100

Hmm, okay. Now, equation 5 gives a relationship between a, d, c, and e.

I can rearrange equation 5:

10a +11d + e = c +100

Since c is a digit (0-9), c +100 is between 100 and 109.

Similarly, 10a +11d + e must be between 100 and 109.

Let me note that.

So,

100 ≤10a +11d + e ≤109

Because c is between 0 and 9, c +100 is 100 to 109.

Thus, 10a +11d + e must be in that range.

Now, a, d, e are digits (0-9). So, let's think about possible values for a, d, e such that 10a +11d + e is between 100 and 109.

Let me denote S = 10a +11d + e.

We have 100 ≤ S ≤109.

Let's think about possible values for a. Since 10a is part of S, and S is between 100 and 109, 10a must be at least 100 minus the maximum possible contributions from 11d and e.

Wait, 11d can be at most 11*9=99, but that's not helpful. Maybe instead, let's solve for a in terms of S.

But maybe it's better to think about the possible a values.

Since 10a ≤ S ≤109, 10a ≤109 → a ≤10.9, but a is a digit, so a ≤9.

Wait, but 10a must contribute enough so that 10a +11d +e is ≥100.

The minimum value for S is 100, so 10a +11d +e ≥100.

Since a is a digit, 0 ≤a ≤9.

So, 10a can be from 0 to 90.

But for S to be ≥100, 10a +11d +e ≥100.

So, 11d +e ≥100 -10a.

But 11d can be up to 99 (if d=9), and e can be up to 9.

So, 11d + e can be up to 108 (99 +9). So, 100 ≤10a +11d +e ≤109.

Let me think about possible a values. Let's see:

If a=9:

10a=90. So, 90 +11d +e ≥100 → 11d +e ≥10.

But 11d +e can be as small as 0 (if d=0, e=0), but here it needs to be at least 10.

But since a=9, S=90 +11d +e, which must be ≤109.

So 11d +e ≤19.

Because 90 +19=109.

So, 11d +e must be between 10 and 19.

Similarly, for a=9, we can have 11d +e between 10 and 19.

Now, for each a, let's see.

But maybe it's better to consider a from 9 down because higher a will require smaller 11d +e.

Wait, let's see.

If a=9:

We have 11d +e between 10 and 19.

What possible (d,e) pairs satisfy this?

Let me list the possible d from 0 to 9 and see:

For each d, find e such that 10 ≤11d +e ≤19.

Given d is a digit (0-9).

Let me go through d:

d=0: 11*0=0. Then e must be between 10 and 19, but e is a digit (0-9). So no solution here.

d=1: 11*1=11. So e must be between 10-19 -11= -1 to 8. Wait, wait: 11d +e ≥10 and ≤19.

So for d=1: 11*1=11. So, 11 +e must be between 10 and19.

11 +e ≥10 → e≥-1, which is always true since e≥0.

11 +e ≤19 → e≤8.

So e can be 0 to 8. So 9 possibilities.

For d=1, e can be 0-8.

So 9 possibilities.

Similarly, d=2: 11*2=22.

22 +e must be between10 and19.
