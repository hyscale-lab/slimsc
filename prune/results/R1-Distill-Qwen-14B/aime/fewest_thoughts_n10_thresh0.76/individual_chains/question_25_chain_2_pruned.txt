Okay, so I have this math problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me see. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which I guess is a given for everyone. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. 

The numbers are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. Also, there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. I'm being asked to find how many own all four of these items—so that's the candy hearts plus the other three.

Wait, but the candy hearts are a given, so if someone owns all four, they have the bag of candy hearts and the other three items. So actually, the four items are the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has the candy hearts, it's kind of the base. So the question is about the overlap among the other three.

But I need to model this with set theory. Let me think. Let’s denote:

- D = set of residents owning a diamond ring.
- G = set owning golf clubs.
- S = set owning a garden spade.
- C = set owning candy hearts, but since everyone owns this, C is the universal set here. So C has 900 elements.

But actually, I think the key is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, D, G, S, since everyone already has the candy hearts. Wait, but the problem mentions four things: the three items and the candy hearts. So maybe I should model it as four sets, but that might complicate things because the candy hearts are universal. Alternatively, perhaps treat the problem as three sets (D, G, S) within the universal set of 900, and the candy hearts are just a given.

But according to the problem, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's universal. So, the four things are D, G, S, and C, but C is always present. So, any ownership of exactly two or three things refers to D, G, and S, because C is already included in all counts.

Wait, this is a bit confusing.
