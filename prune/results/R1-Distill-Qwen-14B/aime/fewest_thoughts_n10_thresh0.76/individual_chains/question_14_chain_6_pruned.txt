Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find this N, I have to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient Q and the remainder R. 

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find the right one. But that might take too long, so maybe there's a smarter way.

The key property is that changing any digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, if N is the number, and let's say its digits are a, b, c, d (from thousands to units place), then:

- If I change a to 1, the number becomes 1bcd, which must be divisible by 7.
- If I change b to 1, the number becomes a1cd, which must be divisible by 7.
- Similarly, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, which must be divisible by 7.
- Changing d to 1 gives abc1, which must be divisible by 7.

So, all four modified numbers must be divisible by 7. That gives me four conditions. Maybe I can model each condition as an equation.

Let me denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. When I change a to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d. Similarly for the others.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. So:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, okay. Since N itself is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, perhaps I can express these conditions in terms of N.

Wait, let's see:

1. When a is changed to 1, the number is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's write this as (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - 1000a + 1000. So, N - 1000a + 1000 must be divisible by 7.

Similarly:

2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = N - 100b + 100. So, N - 100b + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. Changing c to 1: N - 10c + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. Changing d to 1: N - d + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Wait, that seems useful. So, each condition can be written as:

1. N - 1000a + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ N ≡ 1000a - 1000 mod 7
2. N ≡ 100b - 100 mod 7
3. N ≡ 10c - 10 mod 7
4. N ≡ d - 1 mod 7

Hmm, maybe I can write these as:

1. N ≡ (1000 (a - 1)) mod 7
2. N ≡ 100 (b - 1) mod 7
3. N ≡ 10 (c - 1) mod 7
4. N ≡ (d - 1) mod 7

But I need to compute each of these mod 7. Let me recall that 1000 mod 7 is... because 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod7. Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2 ⇒ 100 ≡2 mod7. 10 mod7 is 3, and 1 mod7 is 1.

So, rewriting the conditions:

1. N ≡ 6*(a -1) mod7
2. N ≡ 2*(b -1) mod7
3. N ≡3*(c -1) mod7
4. N ≡ (d -1) mod7

But also, N is equal to 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, which we can write as N ≡ (1000a mod7) + (100b mod7) + (10c mod7) + d mod7.

Calculating each term mod7:

1000a mod7 = 6a mod7,
100b mod7 = 2b mod7,
10c mod7 = 3c mod7,
d mod7 = d mod7.

So, N mod7 = (6a + 2b + 3c + d) mod7.

But from the four conditions above, N must also be congruent to:

1. 6(a -1) mod7
2. 2(b -1) mod7
3. 3(c -1) mod7
4. (d -1) mod7

So, putting it together, we have:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 6(a -1) mod7
Similarly, 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 2(b -1) mod7
And 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡3(c -1) mod7
And 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡d -1 mod7

Let me write each of these congruences:

First condition:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡6a -6 mod7
Subtract 6a from both sides:

2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7
But -6 mod7 is 1, so:

2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7  ...(1)

Second condition:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡2b -2 mod7
Subtract 2b:

6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod7
-2 mod7 is 5, so:

6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7  ...(2)

Third condition:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡3c -3 mod7
Subtract 3c:

6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod7
-3 mod7 is 4, so:

6a + 2b + d ≡4 mod7  ...(3)

Fourth condition:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡d -1 mod7
Subtract d:

6a + 2b + 3c ≡-1 mod7
-1 mod7 is 6, so:

6a + 2b + 3c ≡6 mod7  ...(4)

Okay, so now I have four congruences:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7
2. 6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7
3. 6a + 2b + d ≡4 mod7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡6 mod7

Hmm, maybe I can solve this system step by step.

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

Looking at equations (3) and (4):

From equation (3): 6a + 2b + d ≡4 mod7
From equation (4): 6a + 2b + 3c ≡6 mod7

Let me subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

(6a + 2b + 3c) - (6a + 2b + d) ≡6 -4 mod7
So, 3c - d ≡2 mod7
Which implies d ≡3c -2 mod7 ...(5)

Similarly, from equation (2): 6a +3
