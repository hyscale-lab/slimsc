Alright, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand it.

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. For example, they gave that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 6 and 3, and 6+3=9, which is sqrt(81). 

The task is to find the least integer b (b >= 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Okay, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the two conditions: n is a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its digits equals sqrt(n).

Let me break this down.

First, understanding two-digit numbers in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is written as 'ab'_b, where a is the digit in the b's place and b is the units place. So, in decimal, that would be a*b + b.

Wait, no. Wait, 'ab'_b is a*b^1 + b*b^0, which is a*b + b? Wait, no, the second digit is the units place, so it's a*b + c, where c is the units digit. So, n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b, so a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

So, n is a two-digit number in base b, which means n is between b (when a=1, c=0) and b*(b-1) + (b-1) = b^2 -1. So n is in [b, b^2 -1].

Second condition: the sum of the digits, a + c, equals sqrt(n). So,

a + c = sqrt(n)

But n is a*b + c, so substituting:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe rearrange it differently.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Perhaps factor or find a way to express this equation.

Alternatively, maybe express n as (a + c)^2, since sqrt(n) is a + c.

So, n = (a + c)^2.

But n is also equal to a*b + c.

So,

a*b + c = (a + c)^2

So,

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

Hmm, let me factor that:

a*b = (a + c)(a + c) - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

Wait, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe express this as:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a

Since b must be an integer >=2, and a and c are digits (a >=1, c >=0), both a and c are integers.

So, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers corresponds to the number of pairs (a, c) such that:

1. 1 <= a <= b-1

2. 0 <= c <= b-1

3. (a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Or, equivalently,

b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a

But since b must be an integer, [ (a + c)^2 - c ] must be divisible by a.

So, for given a and c, compute [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a, and check if it's an integer >= 2, and also within the base constraints.

Wait, but the problem is that for each base b, we need to find how many n's exist, which would correspond to the number of pairs (a, c) that satisfy the condition. Then, we need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

So, the approach would be: for each base b starting from 2 upwards, find all possible pairs (a, c) such that:

- a is between 1 and b-1,
