Okay, so I need to solve this math problem. Let me read it again carefully.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, her walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they're asking me to find out how many minutes her walk takes her when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes again.

Hmm, so the problem is about relating speed, time, and distance. The distance is constant at 9 kilometers each time. But the time varies depending on her walking speed, and each time, she spends 't' minutes in the coffee shop. So the total time mentioned includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time.

Let me break this down. First, when she walks at speed 's' km/h, the walking time plus 't' minutes equals 4 hours. Similarly, when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, the walking time plus 't' minutes equals 2 hours and 24 minutes.

Wait, but 2 hours and 24 minutes needs to be converted into hours or minutes to make the units consistent. Since the first time is given in hours, maybe I'll convert everything to hours.

24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2.4 hours.

So, let's define the variables:

- Let the walking time without coffee shop be T1 when speed is 's' km/h.
- Let the walking time without coffee shop be T2 when speed is 's + 2' km/h.

So, the total time for the first scenario is T1 + t/60 = 4 hours. Because 't' is in minutes, so to convert it to hours, divide by 60.

Similarly, for the second scenario: T2 + t/60 = 2.4 hours.

But wait, actually, since the problem says the walk takes her 4 hours including 't' minutes, that means the walking time plus 't' minutes equals 4 hours. So, T1 is the time she spends walking, and 't' is the time spent in the coffee shop. So, T1 + t = 4 hours, but since t is in minutes, I need to convert it to hours.

Wait, maybe I should work entirely in minutes to avoid confusion. Because all time durations can be converted to minutes, and then the equations will be consistent.

Let me try that approach.

So, 4 hours is 240 minutes. So, walking time T1 plus t minutes equals 240 minutes.

Similarly, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 144 minutes. So, walking time T2 plus t minutes equals 144 minutes.

So now, I can write two equations:

1. T1 + t = 240
2. T2 + t = 144

But I also know that the walking time T1 is equal to the distance divided by speed, which is 9 km divided by s km/h. But that would give time in hours. So, T1 (in hours) is 9/s, and to convert that to minutes, it's (9/s)*60.

Similarly, T2 is 9/(s + 2) hours, which is (9/(s + 2))*60 minutes.

So, putting that into equations:

1. (9/s)*60 + t = 240
2. (9/(s + 2))*60 + t = 144

Now, I can write these as:

1. (540/s) + t = 240
2. (540/(s + 2)) + t = 144

So, I have two equations with two variables: 's' and 't'. I can solve these equations to find 's' and 't'.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate 't':

(540/s + t) - (540/(s + 2) + t) = 240 - 144

Simplify the left side:

540/s - 540/(s + 2) = 96

Factor out 540:

540 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 96

Compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = (s + 2 - s) / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, substituting back:

540 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 96

Simplify:

(1080) / [s(s + 2)] = 96

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

1080 = 96 * s(s + 2)

Divide both sides by 96:

1080 / 96 = s(s + 2)

Simplify 1080 / 96. Let's see, both are divisible by 12: 1080/12=90, 96/12=8. So 90/8 = 11.25.

Wait, 96*11=1056, 96*11.25= 96*(11 + 0.25) = 1056 + 24 = 1080. Yes.

So, 11.25 = s^2 + 2s

Bring all terms to one side:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, need to solve this quadratic equation for 's'.

Quadratic equation: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Using quadratic formula:
