Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, I know that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes start from 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. I'm looking for the smallest such prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². So, I guess I should check each prime starting from the smallest and see if such an n exists.

Let me start with p = 2. Does there exist an n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 2² = 4? Let's check n = 1: 1⁴ + 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 4. n = 2: 16 + 1 = 17, which isn't divisible by 4. Wait, maybe n = 3: 81 + 1 = 82. 82 divided by 4 is 20.5. Not an integer. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think. For any n, n⁴ is always either 0 or 1 mod 4 because (even)⁴ is 0 mod 4 and (odd)⁴ is 1 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 would be 1 or 2 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 can never be 0 mod 4. Therefore, p=2 doesn't work.

Moving on to p=3. Let's see if n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9. So I need n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let me compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers). 

n=1: 1⁴=1 → 1 mod9. 1 +1=2 mod9. Not 0.

n=2: 16 mod9 is 7. 7 +1=8 mod9. Not 0.

n=3: 81 mod9 is 0. 0 +1=1 mod9. Not 0.

n=4: 256 mod9. 256 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, remainder 4. So 4 +1=5 mod9. Not 0.

n=5: 625 mod9. Let's sum the digits: 6+2+5=13 → 1+3=4. So 4 mod9. 4 +1=5 mod9. Not 0.

n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod9 is 0. 0 +1=1 mod9. Not 0.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2+4+0+1=7. So 7 mod9. 7 +1=8 mod9. Not 0.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4+0+9+6=19 → 1+9=10 → 1+0=1. So 1 mod9. 1 +1=2 mod9. Not 0.

So for p=3, there's no n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next, p=5. We need n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod25. So n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24, but that's a lot. Maybe I can find patterns or use Euler's theorem.

Euler's theorem says that if n and 25 are coprime, then n^φ(25) ≡1 mod25. φ(25)=20. So n^20≡1 mod25. So n^4 would be a 5th root of unity mod25.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 24, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as n^4 ≡24 mod25. Because -1 mod25 is 24.

Let me check small n:

n=1: 1 → 1 mod25. Not 24.

n=2: 16 mod25. 16. Not 24.

n=3: 81 mod25 is 6. Not 24.

n=4: 256 mod25. 256 -10*25=256-250=6. So 6. Not 24.

n=5: 0 mod25. 0+1=1. Not 24.

n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod25. 25*51=1275. 1296-1275=21. So 21. Not 24.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod25. 2400 is 96*25, so 2401 mod25=1. 1. Not 24.

n=8:8^4=4096. 4096 mod25. 25*163=4075. 4096-4075=21. 21. Not 24.

n=9: 9^4=6561. 6561 mod25. 6560 is 262*25=6550, 6561-6550=11. So 11. Not 24.

n=10:10^4=10000 mod25=0. 0+1=1. Not 24.

n=11:11^4=14641. 14641 mod25. 14625 is 585*25, so 14641-14625=16. So 16. Not 24.

n=12:12^4=20736. 20736 mod25. 25*829=20725. 20736-20725=11. 11. Not 24.

n=13:13^4=28561. 28561 mod25. Let's see, 25*1142=28550. 28561-28550=11. 11. Not 24.

n=14:14^4=38416. Mod25. 25*1536=38400. 38416-38400=16. 16. Not 24.

n=15:15^4=50625 mod25=0. 0+1=1. Not 24.

n=16:16^4=65536. Mod25. 65536-25*2621=65536-65525=11. 11. Not 24.

n=17:17^4=83521. 83521 mod25. Let me sum the digits: 8+3+5+2+1=19→1+9=10. 10 mod25 is 10. 10. Not 24.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe n=7, 17, etc., don't work. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a smarter way.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that n^4 ≡24 mod25. Let me think about solving this congruence.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about modulo 5 first. Because if n^4 ≡ -1 mod25, then n^4 ≡-1 mod5 as well. So first, let's see if n^4 ≡-1 mod5.

n mod5: 0,1,2,3,4.

n=0: 0 mod5. 0^4=0. Not -1.

n=1:1^4=1≡1 mod5. Not -1.

n=2:16≡1 mod5. Not -1.

n=3:81≡1 mod5. Not -1.

n=4:256≡1 mod5. Not -1.

Wait, so n^4 mod5 is always 0 or 1. So there's no solution to n^4 ≡-1 mod5 because -1 mod5 is 4. So n^4 can't be 4 mod5. Therefore, there's no solution for n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25, which implies p=5 doesn't work either.

Hmm, that's a problem. So p=5 is out. Next prime is 7.

So for p=7, we need n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod49. So n⁴ ≡-1 mod49. Let's check if such n exists.

Again, maybe first check modulo7. Because if n⁴ ≡-1 mod49, then n⁴ ≡-1 mod7.

So let's compute n⁴ mod7 for n=0 to 6.

n=0:0^4=0 mod7.

n=1:1 mod7.

n=2:16 mod7=2.

n=3:81 mod7. 7*11=77, 81-77
