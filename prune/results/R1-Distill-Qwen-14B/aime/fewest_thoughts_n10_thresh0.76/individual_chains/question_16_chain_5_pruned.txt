Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². So, my goal is to find p first, the smallest prime where n⁴ +1 is a multiple of p², and then find the smallest m for that p.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime p such that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some positive integer n. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That means that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p² because if I square both sides, (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² mod p², which is 1 mod p². So, the order of n modulo p² divides 8, but since n⁴ ≡ -1, the order isn't 4, but 8. Therefore, 8 must divide the order of the multiplicative group modulo p². Wait, the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic with order p(p-1). So, 8 must divide p(p-1). Since p is prime, p is either 2 or an odd prime.

Wait, let me think. If p is 2, then p² is 4. Let's see if there's an n with n⁴ +1 divisible by 4. Let's check n=1: 1+1=2, not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which mod4 is 1, so not. n=3: 81 +1=82, which mod4 is 2. Not. n=4: 256+1=257, mod4 is 1. Hmm, seems like for p=2, no n satisfies n⁴ ≡ -1 mod4 because n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod4. If n is even, 0; if odd, 1. So, n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2 mod4. So, p=2 can't be the prime we're looking for because n⁴ +1 can't be 0 mod4.

So, p must be an odd prime. So, for p odd, 8 divides p(p-1). Since p is an odd prime, p is odd, so p-1 is even. So, to have 8 divide p(p-1), either p ≡1 mod8, or p-1 is divisible by 8. Wait, p is a prime, so if p is 2, which we already handled, or p is odd. So, for odd primes, p-1 must be divisible by 8, because p is odd, so p is 1 mod2, so p-1 is 0 mod2. So, if p-1 is divisible by 8, then 8 divides p(p-1). So, p ≡1 mod8.

So, the primes p we're considering are primes where p ≡1 mod8. So, the smallest primes are 17, 97, etc. Wait, no. Wait, 17 is the first prime after 2 that is 1 mod8? Wait, let's list primes:

Primes: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...

Looking for primes where p ≡1 mod8. So, let's compute each p mod8.

2 mod8 is 2.

3 mod8 is 3.

5 mod8 is5.

7 mod8 is7.

11 mod8 is3.

13 mod8 is5.

17 mod8 is1.

So, 17 is the first prime
