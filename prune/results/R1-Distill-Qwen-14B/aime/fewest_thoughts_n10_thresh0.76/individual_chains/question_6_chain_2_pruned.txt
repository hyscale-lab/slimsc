Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f and g are given as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I should probably understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. Since both are absolute value functions, their graphs will have V-shapes or something similar. Let me start by analyzing f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

The outer absolute value makes any negative result inside positive. So, let's consider |x|. The function |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 from |x| shifts the graph down by 1/2. So, |x| - 1/2 would have vertices where |x| was 1/2. That would be at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2, but since we take the absolute value again, I need to think about how that affects the graph.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider different cases for x:

Case 1: x >= 0. Then, |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|. This is a V-shape with a vertex at x = 1/2. For x >= 1/2, it's (x - 1/2), and for 0 <= x < 1/2, it's -(x - 1/2) = 1/2 - x.

Case 2: x < 0. Then, |x| = -x, so f(x) = |-x - 1/2| = | - (x + 1/2)| = |x + 1/2|. So, for x < 0, it's a V-shape with a vertex at x = -1/2. For x >= -1/2 (but x < 0), it's (x + 1/2), and for x < -1/2, it's -(x + 1/2) = -x - 1/2.

So, putting this all together, f(x) is a W-shaped graph. It has vertices at x = -1/2, 1/2, and 0. Wait, no. Let me sketch it mentally.

For x >= 1/2: f(x) = x - 1/2, which is an upward line.

For 0 <= x < 1/2: f(x) = 1/2 - x, which is a downward line.

For -1/2 <= x < 0: f(x) = x + 1/2, which is an upward line.

For x < -1/2: f(x) = -x - 1/2, which is a downward line.

So, f(x) is actually a V-shape that's been "reflected" in the middle, making a sort of M or W shape, but symmetric around the y-axis. It's a piecewise linear function with changes at x = -1/2, 0, and 1/2.

Similarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|. Let me analyze that too.

Again, considering |x|, then subtracting 1/4, then taking absolute value. So, let's break it into cases:

Case 1: x >= 0. Then |x| = x, so g(x) = |x - 1/4|. This is a V-shape with vertex at x = 1/4.

Case 2: x < 0. Then |x| = -x, so g(x) = |-x - 1/4| = |x + 1/4|. So, for x >= -1/4 and x < 0, it's x + 1/4; for x < -1/4, it's -(x + 1/4) = -x - 1/4.

Therefore, g(x) is a V-shaped graph with vertices at x = -1/4 and x = 1/4, again symmetric about the y-axis.

So, now I have f and g. Next, the functions in the problem involve compositions of these.

First function: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me parse this.

We have sin(2πx). The sine function oscillates between -
