Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths:
- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. We need to find this distance, which is given in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So point I is equidistant from all four faces. That makes me think of the incenter of a tetrahedron. In a triangle, the incenter is the point where the angle bisectors meet and is equidistant from all sides. Similarly, in a tetrahedron, the incenter is equidistant from all four faces. So, I is the incenter of tetrahedron ABCD.

To find the distance from I to each face, I think I need to find the inradius of the tetrahedron. The formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is:

r = 3V / S

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces).

So, my plan is:
1. Calculate the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD.
2. Calculate the areas of each of the four triangular faces.
3. Sum those areas to get S.
4. Plug V and S into the formula to find r.

But wait, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edge lengths? I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths known, we can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

Where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix:

| 0    1     1     1     1   |
| 1    0    a²    b²    c²  |
| 1   a²    0     d²    e²  |
| 1   b²   d²     0     f²  |
| 1   c²   e²    f²     0   |

So, let me list out all the edge lengths:

AB = √41 ⇒ a = √41 ⇒ a² = 41

AC = √80 ⇒ b = √80 ⇒ b² = 80

AD = √89 ⇒ c = √89 ⇒ c² = 89

BC = √89 ⇒ d = √89 ⇒ d² = 89

BD = √80 ⇒ e = √80 ⇒ e² = 80

CD = √41 ⇒ f = √41 ⇒ f² = 41

So plugging these into the Cayley-Menger matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That sounds complicated. Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry here that can simplify things.

Looking at the edge lengths, they come in pairs: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So this tetrahedron is "equifacial" in a way, but not regular. It's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron, where opposite edges are equal. I recall that in such tetrahedrons, the volume can be calculated using a formula similar to that of a regular tetrahedron, but with some scaling factors.

Alternatively, maybe the Cayley-Menger determinant can be simplified due to the symmetry.

Let me think about the structure of the matrix. The Cayley-Menger matrix is symmetric, which might help.

The matrix is:

0 1 1 1 1

1 0 41 80 89

1 41 0 89 80

1 80 89 0 41

1 89 80 41 0

Hmm, it's symmetric across the main diagonal, but not in the way that a regular tetrahedron would be. Wait, maybe I can exploit the symmetry by permuting the points or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that this is a "biscribed" tetrahedron or something else, but I might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe I can note that this is a tetrahedron where all opposite edges are equal. Such tetrahedrons are called "equilic" or "isohedral," but I'm not sure about the exact term.

Wait, I think in such cases, the tetrahedron can be orthoc
