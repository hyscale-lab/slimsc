Okay, so I have this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the problem states there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable. I need to place some of them into the 25 cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. So, no cell can have more than one chip. That's straightforward.

Next, there are two main conditions:
1. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color.
2. Any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Hmm, so the first condition is about the colors of chips in each row and column. So, for every row, if there are any chips, they must all be the same color. Similarly for each column. But wait, does that mean that each row and column must be entirely one color if they have any chips? Like, a row can't have both white and black chips. It's either all white, all black, or empty.

Then, the second condition says that the placement is maximal. That is, you can't add any more chips without breaking the first condition. So, the arrangement is such that every empty cell is adjacent (in the same row or column) to a cell that already has a chip, which would cause a conflict if you tried to add another chip there.

Wait, no, actually, the condition is that any additional chip would violate the first condition. So, if I try to place a chip in an empty cell, it would cause either its row or column to have different colors. So, how does that happen?

Let me think. Suppose I have a row that already has some chips. If I add a chip to that row, it must be of the same color as the existing chips in that row. Similarly, for a column.

But if a cell is empty, and I try to place a chip there, I must check if the row and column it's in already have some chips. If the row has any chips, they are all of a single color. Similarly for the column. So, the color I can place in that cell must match both the color of the row (if any) and the color of the column (if any). But wait, if the row has a color and the column has another color, then that cell can't
