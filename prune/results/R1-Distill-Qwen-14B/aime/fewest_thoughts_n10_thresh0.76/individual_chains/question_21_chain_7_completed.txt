Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. 

First, let me make sure I understand what a b-eautiful number is. According to the problem, a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met:

1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1 in decimal. So, n is in the range [b, b² - 1].

2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So, if the two digits in base b are a and c, then a + c = sqrt(n).

Wait, okay, let me break that down. In base b, a two-digit number is represented as a*c, where a is the digit in the b's place and c is the digit in the units place. So the value of n in decimal is a*b + c. 

But the problem says that the sum of the digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c.

But n is equal to a*b + c. So, sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c. 

So, squaring both sides, we get:
a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Let me write that equation down:
a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Let me rearrange this equation to see if I can solve for b or something else. Expanding the right side:

(a + c)^2 = a² + 2ac + c²

So:
a*b + c = a² + 2ac + c²

Let's bring everything to one side:
a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Wait, maybe I can factor this or express b in terms of a and c.

Let me solve for b:

a*b = a² + 2ac + c² - c

So,

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c)/a

Simplify the numerator:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = a² + 2ac + c(c - 1)

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, factor the numerator:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a

Wait, that might not help much. Maybe I can express it differently.

Alternatively, considering that a and c are digits in base b, so they must satisfy 0 ≤ a, c < b. But since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1 (since leading zeros aren't allowed). So, a is in [1, b-1], and c is in [0, b-1].

So, given that, for each base b, I need to find all pairs (a, c) such that:

1. a is from 1 to b-1
2. c is from 0 to b-1
3. a*b + c is a perfect square (since sqrt(n) is an integer, because a + c is an integer)
4. sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c

Wait, but actually, if a + c is equal to sqrt(n), and n is a*b + c, which is an integer, then a + c must be an integer, which it is because a and c are digits (integers). So, n must be a perfect square. So each b-eautiful number is also a perfect square.

So, for a given b, we need to find the number of two-digit numbers in base b (i.e., numbers from b to b² -1) that are perfect squares, and whose digits sum to their square roots.

Wait, that's a key point. So, for each base b, the b-eautiful numbers are the perfect squares in [b, b² -1] where the sum of the digits (in base b) equals the square root of the number.

But since the digits sum to sqrt(n), which is an integer, each such n must be a perfect square. So, for each b, we need to consider the perfect squares between b and b² -1, check if their base-b digits sum to their square roots.

Wait, but thinking about it, the number n is a*b + c, which is between b and b² -1. So sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b² -1) ≈ b. So, sqrt(n) is between roughly sqrt(b) and b.

But sqrt(n) must be an integer, so n is a perfect square k², where k is an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b² -1)) which is b-1. So k is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].

Wait, for example, when b=13, 81 is 6*13 + 3=81. So, sqrt(81)=9, and 6 +3=9. So, k=9, which is in [ceil(sqrt(13))=4, 12]. So that works.

So, for each base b, the possible k values are from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.

Wait, but sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so k can go up to b-1.

So, for each b, the possible k values are integers from k_min = ceil(sqrt(b)) to k_max = b -1.

Now, for each k in this range, we can write n = k². Then, n must be representable as a two-digit number in base b, which is a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b (so 0 <= c < b, and 1 <= a < b).

Also, the sum of digits a + c must equal k.

So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of k's in [k_min, k_max] such that n =k² can be written as a*b + c with a + c = k.

So, let's write the equations:

n = a*b + c = k²
a + c = k

So, we can substitute c = k - a into the first equation:

a*b + (k - a) = k²

Simplify:

a*b + k - a = k²

Factor a:

a*(b -1) + k = k²

Then,

a*(b -1) = k² - k

So,

a = (k² -k)/(b -1)

Since a must be an integer (as it's a digit in base b), (k² -k) must be divisible by (b -1). Also, a must satisfy 1 <= a < b. So, (k² -k)/(b -1) must be an integer between 1 and b-1 inclusive.

So, for each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], we can compute a = (k² -k)/(b -1). If a is integer, and satisfies 1 <= a < b, then (a, c = k -a) is a valid pair, and n=k² is a b-eautiful number.

Therefore, to find the number of b-eautiful numbers for a base b, we can iterate over each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], compute a = (k² -k)/(b -1), check if a is integer, and if so, whether a is in [1, b-1].

So, for each b, the count is the number of such k's that satisfy these conditions.

Our goal is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

So, perhaps the approach is:

For each b starting from 2 upwards, compute the number of b-eautiful numbers, and find the first b where this number is greater than 10.

But doing this manually for each b is time-consuming, so perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.

Wait, let's think about it.

Given that a = (k² -k)/(b -1), and a must be integer and 1 <= a < b.

So, b -1 must divide k² -k. So, (k² -k) mod (b -1) = 0.

Which is equivalent to k(k - 1) ≡ 0 mod (b -1).

So, (b -1) divides k(k -1). So, for each k, we can see if (b -1) divides k(k -1). 

But since we are looking for each b, perhaps it's better to fix b and find the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where (b -1) divides k(k -1).

So, for a given b, let d = b -1.

Then, for each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], check if d divides k(k -1).

So, the problem reduces to, for each d >=1 (since b >=2), find the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] such that d divides k(k -1).

Hmm, that's interesting.

So, d divides k(k -1), which implies that d is a divisor of k(k -1). Since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, d must be a product of factors from k and k-1.

But since d is fixed for each base b, we can factor d into two coprime parts: d1 and d2, such that d1 divides k and d2 divides k -1. Because since k and k -1 are coprime, d1 and d2 must be coprime as well.

Therefore, for each d, the number of k's is equal to the number of solutions to the congruence:

k ≡ 0 mod d1
k ≡ 1 mod d2

where d1*d2 = d, and gcd(d1, d2) = 1.

This is because d1 divides k and d2 divides k-1.

So, the number of solutions for each such pair (d1, d2) is determined by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But for each d, the number of such pairs (d1, d2) is equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime factors d1 and d2, where d1 >=1 and d2 >=1.

Each such coprime factorization corresponds to a system of congruences, which has a solution for k.

But the number of such k's in the range [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] would depend on how many solutions exist and whether they fall within that interval.

This is getting a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to proceed with some examples to see if we can find a pattern.

Let me try small values of b and see how the count of b-eautiful numbers behaves.

Starting with b=2:

b=2, so d=1.

k must be in [ceil(sqrt(2))=2, 1]. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2 >1. So, there are no k's in this range. So, no b-eautiful numbers for b=2.

b=3, d=2.

k must be in [ceil(sqrt(3))=2, 2]. So, k=2.

Check if 2 divides k(k -1)=2*1=2. Yes, 2 divides 2.

So, a=(4 -2)/(3 -1) = 2/2=1.

So, a=1, c=k -a=1.

Check if a <3: yes, 1<3. So, n=1*3 +1=4, which is 2². So, n=4 is 3-eautiful. So, count is 1.

b=4, d=3.

k must be in [ceil(sqrt(4))=2, 3]. So, k=2,3.

For k=2:

k(k-1)=2*1=2. Does 3 divide 2? No.

For k=3:

3*2=6. Does 3 divide 6? Yes. So, a=(9 -3)/(4 -1)=6/3=2.

Check a <4: yes, 2<4. So, c=3-2=1.

So, n=2*4 +1=9, which is 3². So that's valid. So, count is 1.

Wait, but k=2 didn't work, so only k=3 works. So, count=1.

b=5, d=4.

k must be in [ceil(sqrt(5))=3,4].

k=3:

k(k -1)=3*2=6. Does 4 divide 6? No.

k=4:

4*3=12. Does 4 divide 12? Yes. a=(16 -4)/(5 -1)=12/4=3.

a=3 <5, so yes. c=4-3=1.

n=3*5 +1=16, which is 4². So, count=1.

So, b=5 has one b-eautiful number.

b=6, d=5.

k must be in [ceil(sqrt(6))=3,5].

k=3:

3*2=6. 5 divides 6? No.

k=4:

4*3=12. 5 divides 12? No.

k=5:

5*4=20. 5 divides 20? Yes.

a=(25 -5)/(6 -1)=20/5=4.

a=4<6, yes. c=5-4=1.

n=4*6 +1=25, which is 5². So, count=1.

b=6 has one.

b=7, d=6.

k in [3,6].

Check for each k:

k=3: 3*2=6. 6 divides 6? Yes. So, a=(9 -3)/(7-1)=6/6=1. So, a=1, c=3-1=2.

Check a <7: yes. c=2<7: yes.

So, n=1*7 +2=9, which is 3². So, that's valid.

k=4: 4*3=12. 6 divides 12? Yes. a=(16 -4)/6=12/6=2.

a=2<7: yes. c=4-2=2.

n=2*7 +2=16, which is 4². Valid.

k=5:5*4=20. 6 divides 20? 20 ÷6=3 with remainder 2. No.

k=6:6*5=30. 6 divides 30? Yes. a=(36 -6)/6=30/6=5.

a=5<7: yes. c=6-5=1.

n=5*7 +1=36, which is 6². Valid.

So, for b=7, we have k=3,4,6, which give a=1,2,5 respectively. So, count=3.

So, b=7 has 3 b-eautiful numbers.

Hmm, count increased. Let's continue.

b=8, d=7.

k in [3,7].

Check each k:

k=3:3*2=6. 7 divides 6? No.

k=4:4*3=12. 7? 12 ÷7=1 rem 5. No.

k=5:5*4=20. 20 ÷7=2 rem 6. No.

k=6:6*5=30. 30 ÷7=4 rem 2. No.

k=7:7*6=42. 42 ÷7=6. Yes.

So, a=(49 -7)/7=42/7=6.

a=6 <8: yes. c=7-6=1.

n=6*8 +1=49, which is 7². So, count=1.

So, b=8 has one.

Hmm, back to 1. Interesting.

b=9, d=8.

k in [3,8].

k=3:3*2=6. 8 divides 6? No.

k=4:4*3=12. 8? 12 ÷8=1 rem 4. No.

k=5:5*4=20. 20 ÷8=2 rem 4. No.

k=6:6*5=30. 30 ÷8=3 rem 6. No.

k=7:7*6=42. 42 ÷8=5 rem 2. No.

k=8:8*7=56. 56 ÷8=7. Yes.

a=(64 -8)/8=56/8=7.

a=7 <9: yes. c=8-7=1.

n=7*9 +1=64, which is 8². So, count=1.

b=9 has 1.

b=10, d=9.

k in [4,9].

k=4:4*3=12. 9 divides 12? 12 ÷9=1 rem 3. No.

k=5:5*4=20. 20 ÷9=2 rem 2. No.

k=6:6*5=30. 30 ÷9=3 rem 3. No.

k=7:7*6=42. 42 ÷9=4 rem 6. No.

k=8:8*7=56. 56 ÷9=6 rem 2. No.

k=9:9*8=72. 72 ÷9=8. Yes.

a=(81 -9)/9=72/9=8.

a=8<10: yes. c=9-8=1.

n=8*10 +1=81, which is 9². So, count=1.

Hmm, so b=10 has 1.

Wait, but earlier, for b=7, we had 3. Maybe the counts can sometimes be higher.

Let's try b=13, since the example given was 81 (which is 9²) in base 13.

Wait, let me check b=13.

b=13, d=12.

k in [4,12].

For each k from 4 to 12:

Check if 12 divides k(k-1).

k=4:4*3=12. 12 divides 12: yes.

So, a=(16 -4)/12=12/12=1. a=1 <13: yes. c=4-1=3.

n=1*13 +3=16=4². Valid.

k=5:5*4=20. 20 ÷12=1 rem8. No.

k=6:6*5=30. 30 ÷12=2 rem6. No.

k=7:7*6=42. 42 ÷12=3 rem6. No.

k=8:8*7=56. 56 ÷12=4 rem8. No.

k=9:9*8=72. 72 ÷12=6. Yes.

a=(81 -9)/12=72/12=6. a=6 <13: yes. c=9-6=3.

n=6*13 +3=81=9². Valid.

k=10:10*9=90. 90 ÷12=7 rem6. No.

k=11:11*10=110. 110 ÷12=9 rem2. No.

k=12:12*11=132. 132 ÷12=11. Yes.

a=(144 -12)/12=132/12=11. a=11<13: yes. c=12-11=1.

n=11*13 +1=143 +1=144=12². Valid.

So, for b=13, we have k=4,9,12, which gives 3 numbers:16,81,144. So, count=3.

Wait, but the problem said 81 is 13-eautiful, which is one of them. So, 3 in total.

So, seems like for some bases, the count is 3, but not more.

Wait, but we need to find the least b where count exceeds 10. So, maybe we need to find a base where more k's satisfy the condition.

Perhaps, let's think about when d divides multiple k(k-1)s.

Since d divides k(k-1), and since d =b -1, perhaps if d is highly composite, it's more likely to have multiple k's.

So, perhaps bases with d being a composite number with many factors would have more k's.

Perhaps d=30, which has many factors.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to look for d with many divisors, so that there are more pairs (d1, d2) where d1*d2 =d and gcd(d1,d2)=1.

Each such pair gives rise to a solution for k via the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Each solution k must lie in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d].

So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime pairs (d1, d2) with d1*d2=d, and k in the range.

Wait, but how many coprime pairs are there for a given d?

The number of such pairs is 2^{m-1}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Because each prime factor can go to d1 or d2, but since d1 and d2 must be coprime, the factors can't overlap.

So, for a given d with m distinct prime factors, the number of coprime pairs (d1, d2) is 2^{m-1} (since each prime can be assigned to d1 or d2, but we count unordered pairs, so divide by 2).

Wait, actually, the number of unordered coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=d is 2^{m-1}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Because each prime can go to d1 or d2, but since the pair is unordered, we divide by 2.

So, for example, d=6=2*3. m=2. So, number of coprime pairs is 2^{1}=2. Which are (1,6) and (2,3). Wait, but (1,6) and (6,1) are same as unordered pairs.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think about ordered pairs. For ordered coprime pairs, it's 2^{m}.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If d has prime factorization d= p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an.

Then, the number of ways to write d as d1*d2 where d1 and d2 are coprime is equal to 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Because for each prime, we can assign it entirely to d1 or to d2.

So, for each prime, 2 choices, leading to 2^m ordered pairs. Since d1 and d2 are ordered (d1 divides k, d2 divides k-1), the number of ordered pairs is 2^m.

But in our case, since d1 and d2 are positive integers, each coprime pair (d1, d2) with d1*d2=d gives a unique solution to the congruence.

So, for each such pair, we can solve the congruence:

k ≡0 mod d1

k ≡1 mod d2

And by Chinese Remainder Theorem, since d1 and d2 are coprime, there is a unique solution modulo d.

So, for each of the 2^m ordered coprime pairs (d1, d2), we get a solution for k modulo d. So, in the range [1, d], there will be exactly one solution for each pair.

Therefore, the number of solutions k in [1, d] is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But in our problem, k must be in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d]. So, only those solutions k which lie in this interval are counted.

So, the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b is equal to the number of solutions k in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] for each coprime pair (d1, d2). So, the total number could be up to 2^{m}, but some of the solutions may lie below ceil(sqrt(d+1)).

So, to maximize the count, we want d to be such that as many of the solutions k lie in the upper range of [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d].

So, perhaps when d is a number with many small prime factors, and d is large enough that sqrt(d +1) is small compared to d, so that most solutions k are in the upper range.

So, perhaps d=2^k, which has m=1, so 2^1=2 solutions. But that's not enough.

Wait, maybe d=product of first several primes. Let's try d=30, which is 2*3*5. So, m=3. So, number of solutions is 2^3=8.

So, for d=30, we can have up to 8 solutions, but need to check how many lie in [ceil(sqrt(31))=6, 30].

So, the number of k's would be up to 8, but perhaps some are below 6.

Hmm, let me compute for d=30.

But wait, we're looking for b=31, since d=b-1=30.

So, b=31.

Now, for d=30, which is 2*3*5, m=3, so 8 ordered coprime pairs.

Each pair (d1,d2) gives a solution for k.

But let's see how many of those k's are in [6,30].

Alternatively, let's compute the number of k's for b=31.

Wait, but this might take a while. Maybe I can find a better approach.

Wait, let me think about the equation again.

We have a = (k² -k)/(b -1).

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, for each k, (k² -k) must be divisible by (b -1), and (k² -k)/(b -1) must be less than b.

So, (k² -k)/(b -1) < b

=> k² -k < b(b -1)

But since k <= b-1, let's plug in k = b-1:

(b-1)^2 - (b-1) = (b² - 2b +1) -b +1 = b² -3b +2

So, b² -3b +2 < b(b-1)=b² -b

Which simplifies to:

b² -3b +2 < b² -b

Subtract b² from both sides:

-3b +2 < -b

Add 3b to both sides:

2 < 2b

=> 1 < b

Which is true for b >=2.

So, the condition (k² -k)/(b -1) < b is automatically satisfied for all k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

But we need a >=1:

(k² -k)/(b -1) >=1

=> k² -k >= b -1

So, for each k, k² -k >= b -1.

But since k <= b-1, let's see when k² -k >= b -1.

Let me consider the minimal k in the range, which is ceil(sqrt(b)).

So, for k=ceil(sqrt(b)), we have k² -k >= b -1.

So, k² -k >= b -1.

But k ≈ sqrt(b), so k² ≈ b.

So, k² -k ≈ b - sqrt(b).

So, we require b - sqrt(b) >= b -1 => -sqrt(b) >= -1 => sqrt(b) <=1 => b<=1.

But b>=2, so this is not possible. So, for the minimal k, the inequality k² -k >= b-1 may not hold. So, only for larger k's.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, for each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], we can compute whether (k² -k) is divisible by (b-1), and if so, then a is an integer and a >=1.

So, perhaps we can find for a given d (where d = b-1), the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] such that d divides k(k -1).

So, the number of such k's is equal to the number of solutions to the congruence k(k -1) ≡0 mod d, with k in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d].

So, for d=30, which is 2*3*5.

The number of coprime pairs (d1, d2) is 2^3=8.

Each such pair gives a unique solution for k modulo 30.

So, there are 8 solutions for k in [1,30].

But how many of these are in [6,30]?

Since the solutions are spread across the entire range, perhaps about half of them are in the upper half.

But without computing each, it's hard to say.

But perhaps, for d=30, the number of solutions in [6,30] is 8.

But let's compute.

Wait, for each coprime pair (d1, d2), solve:

k ≡0 mod d1

k ≡1 mod d2

Each of these will give a unique solution modulo 30.

So, for each of the 8 pairs, we can compute k and see if it's in [6,30].

But 8 solutions is manageable.

Let me list all the coprime pairs (d1, d2) where d1*d2=30 and gcd(d1,d2)=1.

The coprime pairs are:

(1,30), (2,15), (3,10), (5,6), (6,5), (10,3), (15,2), (30,1).

Wait, but since d1 and d2 are ordered, each pair is unique.

Now, for each pair, solve:

k ≡0 mod d1

k ≡1 mod d2

Find k in [1,30], then check if it's >=6.

Let me compute each:

1. d1=1, d2=30:

k ≡0 mod1 → always true.

k ≡1 mod30 → k=1,31,...

In [1,30], k=1.

But 1 <6, so not counted.

2. d1=2, d2=15:

k≡0 mod2 → k even.

k≡1 mod15.

Looking for k even and k ≡1 mod15.

Find k in [1,30].

Numbers ≡1 mod15:1,16,31,...

Even numbers:16 is even.

So, k=16.

16 is in [6,30], so count it.

3. d1=3, d2=10:

k≡0 mod3

k≡1 mod10.

Find k in [1,30].

Numbers ≡1 mod10:1,11,21,31,...

Check which are divisible by3:

1: 1 not divisible by3.

11: 11/3=3 rem2.

21:21/3=7 → yes.

So, k=21.

21 is in [6,30], count it.

4. d1=5, d2=6:

k≡0 mod5

k≡1 mod6.

Find k in [1,30].

Numbers ≡1 mod6:1,7,13,19,25,31,...

Check which are divisible by5:

1: no.

7: no.

13: no.

19: no.

25: 25/5=5 → yes.

So, k=25.

In range, count it.

5. d1=6, d2=5:

k≡0 mod6

k≡1 mod5.

Find k in [1,30].

Numbers ≡1 mod5:1,6,11,16,21,26,31,...

Check which are divisible by6:

6: 6/6=1 → yes.

So, k=6.

In range, count it.

6. d1=10, d2=3:

k≡0 mod10

k≡1 mod3.

Numbers ≡1 mod3:1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28,31,...

Check which are divisible by10:

10:10/10=1 → yes.

So, k=10.

In range, count it.

7. d1=15, d2=2:

k≡0 mod15

k≡1 mod2.

Numbers ≡1 mod2: odd numbers.

Looking for k divisible by15 and odd.

In [1,30], k=15.

15 is odd and divisible by15.

So, k=15.

In range, count it.

8. d1=30, d2=1:

k≡0 mod30

k≡1 mod1.

k≡0 mod30 and any number ≡1 mod1 is any integer.

So, k=30.

30 is in [6,30], count it.

So, for d=30, the solutions k in [1,30] are:

1,16,21,25,6,10,15,30.

Of these, the ones >=6 are:

6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That's 7 solutions.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's 8, but one solution (k=1) is below 6, so 7 solutions.

So, for b=31, d=30, we have 7 b-eautiful numbers.

But we're looking for more than 10. So, 7 is still less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount.

Wait, the solutions are:

1 (excluded), 6,10,15,16,21,25,30.

So, 7 k's in the range [6,30].

So, 7 b-eautiful numbers for b=31.

Hmm, not enough.

So, perhaps we need a d with more prime factors.

Wait, if d=2*3*5*7=210, which has m=4 distinct primes, so 2^4=16 ordered coprime pairs.

Thus, 16 solutions for k in [1,210].

But how many of these are in [ceil(sqrt(211))=15, 210]?

Well, it's possible that many of these solutions are in the upper range.

But computing all 16 would be tedious, but maybe we can find how many k's would be >=15.

Alternatively, perhaps for d=210, the number of solutions in [15,210] is 16. But likely, not all of them, since for each pair, k can be in any part of the range.

But it's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a d with multiple small factors, leading to more solutions.

Wait, perhaps d=105=3*5*7.

m=3, so 8 coprime pairs.

Wait, but 8 solutions is similar to d=30.

Alternatively, perhaps d=24=2^3*3.

m=2 (primes 2 and 3). So, 4 coprime pairs.

Wait, but let's try b=25, d=24.

Compute the number of k's in [5,24] where 24 divides k(k-1).

Each coprime pair (d1,d2) where d1*d2=24, gcd(d1,d2)=1.

The coprime pairs are:

(1,24), (3,8), (8,3), (24,1).

So, 4 pairs.

For each pair:

1. d1=1, d2=24:

k≡0 mod1 → any k.

k≡1 mod24 → k=1,25,...

In [5,24], k=1 is below 5, so no solution here.

2. d1=3, d2=8:

k≡0 mod3

k≡1 mod8.

Find k in [5,24].

Numbers ≡1 mod8:1,9,17,25,...

Check which are divisible by3:

1: no.

9:9/3=3 → yes. So, k=9.

9 is in [5,24], so count.

3. d1=8, d2=3:

k≡0 mod8

k≡1 mod3.

Numbers ≡1 mod3:1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,...

Check which are divisible by8:

16:16/8=2 → yes.

So, k=16.

In range, count.

4. d1=24, d2=1:

k≡0 mod24

k≡1 mod1 → any k.

So, k=24.

In range, count.

So, total solutions in [5,24]:9,16,24. So, 3 solutions.

Thus, count=3.

Not enough.

Hmm, perhaps try d=60=2^2*3*5, m=3, so 8 pairs.

But let's see:

b=61, d=60.

Number of solutions is 8, but how many are in [8,60].

But to compute, I'd need to solve for each coprime pair.

But perhaps this is time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of solutions is when d is a factorial, which has many factors.

Wait, d=24 is 4!, but that's not enough.

Wait, perhaps d=120=5!, which has many factors.

But perhaps we can find a pattern.

Wait, going back, for each d, the number of solutions is up to 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors.

So, to get more than 10 solutions, we need 2^m >10, which is m>=4, since 2^4=16.

So, d must have at least 4 distinct prime factors.

The smallest such d is 2*3*5*7=210.

So, d=210.

Thus, b=211.

For d=210, m=4, so 16 coprime pairs.

Each pair will give a solution for k modulo 210.

Thus, there are 16 solutions for k in [1,210].

But how many of these are in [ceil(sqrt(211))=15, 210]?

It's likely that all 16 solutions are in this range, except possibly the smallest k=1.

Wait, let's check.

But actually, each solution k is unique modulo 210, so the smallest solution is k=1, next is k=1+210, which is beyond our range.

Wait, no, in [1,210], each solution is unique.

But for each coprime pair (d1,d2), the solution k is in [1,210].

But how many of these are >=15?

Probably, most of them.

Let's compute how many solutions are >=15.

If we have 16 solutions in [1,210], and one of them is k=1, then 15 solutions are >=1.

But we need them to be >=15.

But without computing each, it's hard to say exactly, but likely, most of the 16 solutions are greater than 15.

Wait, 1 is the only solution less than 15, so 16-1=15 solutions >=15.

So, for d=210, the number of solutions in [15,210] is 15.

Thus, b=211 would have 15 b-eautiful numbers.

But 15 is more than 10, so b=211 would be a candidate.

But is 211 the smallest such b?

Wait, perhaps there is a smaller d with m=4.

But 210 is the smallest number with 4 distinct prime factors. So, the next smaller d with 4 distinct prime factors is 210.

But wait, 210 is 2*3*5*7.

No smaller number than 210 has 4 distinct prime factors.

Because 2*3*5*7=210.

So, any d with 4 distinct prime factors must be at least 210.

Thus, b=211 is the smallest base where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10.

Wait, but let me check if there's a d= multiple of a square with more factors.

Wait, for example, d=30=2*3*5, which has m=3, but has exponents 1 for each prime.

But what about d=48=16*3=2^4*3.

m=2, so 4 coprime pairs.

But that gives only 4 solutions, which is less than 10.

Alternatively, d=60=2^2*3*5, m=3, 8 solutions.

But earlier, for d=60, I think the number of solutions in [8,60] would be around 8, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but 2^3=8, so if we have d=2^4*3*5*7=840, which is larger than 210, so 211 is smaller.

Thus, perhaps 211 is the answer.

But wait, let's think again.

Wait, the number of solutions for d=210 is 16, but the number of k's in [15,210] is 16 -1=15, as k=1 is the only one below 15.

So, 15 solutions.

Thus, b=211 would have 15 b-eautiful numbers.

But we need more than 10, so 15 is sufficient.

But is 211 the smallest such b?

Is there a smaller d with m=4?

Wait, no. Because the smallest d with 4 distinct prime factors is 210, as 2*3*5*7=210.

So, the next possible b is 211.

But wait, perhaps a d with m=3 but higher exponents could have more solutions.

Wait, for d=60=2^2*3*5.

m=3, so 8 solutions.

But let's see how many of them are >=8.

Wait, for d=60, the solutions would be spread across 1 to 60.

But perhaps some are below 8.

But without computing, it's hard to say, but likely not all 8 are above 8.

Thus, perhaps 8 solutions, but some are below 8, so maybe 7 or 6 above.

Which is still less than 10.

So, perhaps the first b where the count exceeds 10 is b=211.

But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps there is a d with m=4, but d=2*3*5*7=210, which is the minimal.

Thus, b=211 is the minimal base.

But wait, let's think about this differently.

Suppose d=2^k, which is not square-free, but has only one prime factor.

So, m=1, 2 solutions.

Not enough.

Alternatively, d=30=2*3*5, m=3, 8 solutions.

But as we saw earlier, for d=30, only 7 solutions are in the upper range.

So, 7 <10.

So, need more.

Thus, perhaps the minimal d is 210, leading to b=211.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think if there's a way to get more than 10 solutions without d being 210.

Alternatively, perhaps d= multiple with more exponents but fewer primes.

Wait, for example, d=24=2^3*3.

m=2, so 4 solutions.

But as we saw earlier, only 3 solutions in the upper range.

Not enough.

Alternatively, d=12=2^2*3.

m=2, 4 solutions.

Compute for d=12, b=13.

k in [4,12].

Compute solutions:

d1=1, d2=12: k=1, excluded.

d1=3, d2=4:

k≡0 mod3

k≡1 mod4.

Numbers ≡1 mod4:1,5,9,13,...

Check which are divisible by3:

9:9/3=3 → yes. So, k=9.

d1=4, d2=3:

k≡0 mod4

k≡1 mod3.

Numbers ≡1 mod3:1,4,7,10,13,...

Check divisible by4:

4:4/4=1 → yes. So, k=4.

d1=12, d2=1:

k=12.

So, solutions are k=4,9,12.

Which are in [4,12], so count=3.

So, 3 solutions.

Not enough.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps d= multiple exponents with same primes.

Wait, perhaps m=3 with d= p^a q^b r^c, but that doesn't increase the number of coprime pairs beyond 2^3=8.

So, perhaps the only way to get more solutions is to have more distinct prime factors.

Thus, the minimal d with m=4 is 210.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.

But wait, let me check for d= 2*3*5*7=210.

Number of solutions is 16.

But how many are in [15,210].

Assuming only k=1 is below 15, so 15 solutions.

So, 15>10.

Thus, b=211 is the minimal base.

But wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, actually, the number of solutions is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct primes.

So, for m=4, 16 solutions.

But each solution is unique modulo d.

Thus, in the range [1,d], each solution is unique, so k=1, k2, k3,...,k16.

But in the interval [ceil(sqrt(d+1)),d], which is [15,210], we have k must be between 15 and 210.

Thus, all solutions except possibly k=1 are in the range.

Thus, 16-1=15 solutions.

Thus, 15>10.

So, b=211 is the minimal base.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, the number of solutions is 2^{m}, but m=number of distinct prime factors.

So, for d=210, m=4, so 16 solutions.

But in the range [15,210], all except k=1 are included, so 15 solutions.

Thus, the count is 15>10.

So, the minimal b is 211.

But wait, let me check for d=210.

Wait, but let me compute one of the solutions.

For example, take d1=2, d2=105.

Solve:

k≡0 mod2

k≡1 mod105.

Find k in [1,210].

Numbers ≡1 mod105:1,106,211,...

Even numbers:

106 is even.

So, k=106.

Which is in [15,210], so count.

Another pair: d1=3, d2=70.

k≡0 mod3

k≡1 mod70.

Numbers ≡1 mod70:1,71,141,211,...

Check which are divisible by3:

71 ÷3=23 rem2 → no.

141 ÷3=47 → yes. So, k=141.

In range, count.

Similarly, for each pair, the solution k is in [15,210], except k=1.

So, 15 solutions.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.

But wait, is 211 really the minimal base?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than b, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the equation a = (k² -k)/(b -1).

We can think of this as a quadratic in k:

k² -k -a(b -1) =0.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) multiplied by something.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of this as a function f(b) which counts the number of b-eautiful numbers.

We need to find the minimal b where f(b) >10.

From earlier examples, f(7)=3, f(13)=3, f(31)=7, f(211)=15.

So, perhaps 211 is the minimal b.

But I'm not sure if there's a smaller b.

Wait, perhaps d= multiple with higher exponents.

Wait, for example, d= multiple of 2,3,5,7, but with exponents.

But no, the number of coprime pairs is determined by the number of distinct primes, not exponents.

Thus, the minimal d with m=4 is 210.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.

But wait, is 211 the minimal base?

Wait, perhaps I can check for d=240=16*3*5.

m=3, so 8 solutions.

But in the range [16,240], how many solutions?

Probably 8.

But 8<10.

So, no.

Thus, seems like the minimal b is 211.

But before finalizing, let me check for d=210, b=211.

Number of solutions is 16, but in the range [15,210], 15 solutions.

Thus, f(b)=15>10.

Thus, 211 is the minimal base.

Wait, but let me check for d=105=3*5*7.

m=3, so 8 solutions.

In the range [11,105], how many solutions?

Probably, 7 or 8.

But 8<10, so not enough.

Thus, moving up, the next is d=210, leading to b=211.

So, the answer is 211.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer base \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). 

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding \( b \)-eautiful Numbers**:
   - A two-digit number in base \( b \) is represented as \( a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) (i.e., \( 1 \leq a < b \) and \( 0 \leq c < b \)).
   - For \( n \) to be \( b \)-eautiful, \( \sqrt{n} = a + c \) and \( n = a \cdot b + c \).

2. **Equation Derivation**:
   - From the conditions, we derive the equation:
     \[
     a \cdot b + c = (a + c)^2
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     a \cdot (b - 1) = k^2 - k \quad \text{where} \quad k = a + c
     \]
   - Thus, \( a = \frac{k^2 - k}{b - 1} \), which must be an integer.

3. **Finding Valid Bases**:
   - For each base \( b \), we need to find all \( k \) in the range \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \leq k \leq b - 1 \) such that \( b - 1 \) divides \( k(k - 1) \).
   - The number of valid \( k \) values determines the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers.

4. **Maximizing the Count**:
   - The number of valid \( k \) values is maximized when \( b - 1 \) has many divisors. This occurs when \( b - 1 \) is a product of several distinct primes.
   - The smallest \( b - 1 \) with enough divisors to yield more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers is \( 210 \) (since \( 210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \)), which has \( 2^4 = 16 \) divisors.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The smallest \( b \) such that \( b - 1 = 210 \) is \( b = 211 \). This base yields 15 \( b \)-eautiful numbers, exceeding the required count of ten.

Thus, the least integer \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers is:

\[
\boxed{211}
\]
