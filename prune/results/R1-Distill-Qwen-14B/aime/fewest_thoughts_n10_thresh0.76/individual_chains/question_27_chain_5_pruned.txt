Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3. 

The sphere S has a radius of 11. So, when the torus T is placed inside the sphere, it's tangent internally along a circle with radius r_i. When it's placed outside, it's tangent externally along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, let me think about the geometry here. 

First, the torus T. The standard way to represent a torus is using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this problem, R is 6 and r is 3. 

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, they are tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, respectively.

Let me consider the internal tangent case first. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The point of tangency would be a circle on both the sphere and the torus. 

I think the key is to find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus when they are tangent. Wait, but the torus is a surface, so its "center" isn't a single point. Maybe it's the center of the generating circle? Or maybe the center of the sphere and the center of the torus's generating circle are the same? 

Wait, when the torus is resting inside the sphere, their centers would coincide, right? Because otherwise, the torus might not be symmetrically placed inside the sphere. So, the center of the sphere S is the same as the center of the generating circle of the torus T. 

So, for the internal tangency: the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The point where they touch will be on the outer part of the torus. The farthest point on the torus from the center would be along the major radius direction. So, the major radius of the torus is 6, and the minor radius is 3. So, the maximum distance from the center to a point on the torus is R + r = 6 + 3 = 9. But wait, the sphere has a radius of 11. That's larger, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere. Hmm, but then how does it become tangent? Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency. Let me denote O as the center of the sphere, and C as the center of the generating circle of the torus, which is also the center of the sphere since they are concentric. 

When the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency would be where the outer surface of the torus just touches the inner surface of the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the point of tangency is where the inner surface of the torus touches the outer surface of the sphere. 

So, in the internal tangent case, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is inside. The point of tangency is on the outer equator of the torus. So, the distance from the center O to this point is the major radius plus minor radius: 6 + 3 = 9. But that's less than 11, so it's inside the sphere. But the sphere's radius is 11, so the point of tangency is at a distance of 11 from O? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus mathematically. The equation of a torus in 3D can be written in terms of its major and minor radii. If the torus is centered at the origin, and its generating circle lies in the xy-plane, then the parametric equations for the torus are:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

where θ and φ are angles parameterizing the torus. Here
