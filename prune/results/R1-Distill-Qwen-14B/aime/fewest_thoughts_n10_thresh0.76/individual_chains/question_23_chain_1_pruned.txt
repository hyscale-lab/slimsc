Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola equation is given as (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally because the positive term is with x². The rhombus is called ABCD, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay. So, BD is one of the diagonals of the rhombus, and we're looking for the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD² such that for every possible rhombus ABCD on this hyperbola, BD² is greater than this number. Wait, no, actually, the question says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's the maximum lower bound, meaning the smallest possible BD² across all possible such rhombi, but the greatest number that is still less than BD² for all of them. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The way it's phrased is: "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, we need a number m such that m < BD² for every possible rhombus ABCD on this hyperbola, and m is as large as possible. So m is the infimum of BD² over all such rhombi. So, m would be the minimum possible BD², but the question is phrased to find the greatest number less than all BD², which is the same as the minimum BD² because m has to be less than every BD², so the maximum such m is the minimal BD².

Wait, no, that's if m is the infimum. Let me clarify. Suppose that for all rhombi, BD² is greater than or equal to some value m. Then m is a lower bound for BD², and the greatest such lower bound is the infimum of BD². So, the problem is asking for the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola, which is the maximum m such that m ≤ BD
