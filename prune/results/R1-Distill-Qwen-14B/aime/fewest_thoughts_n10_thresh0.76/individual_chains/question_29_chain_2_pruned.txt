Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me start by understanding the given information and what's being asked.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on the same straight line. Additionally, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, those four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference.

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let's try to visualize or sketch the problem. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles.

Let me note down the properties of rectangles:

- All angles are 90 degrees.
- Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- The diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.

Given that, let's assign coordinates to the points to model this. Coordinates might help me calculate the distances and figure out the relationships.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then:

- Point C will be at (BC, 0) because BC is the horizontal side. Since BC = 16, point C is at (16, 0).
- Point B will be at (0, AB) because AB is the vertical side. AB is 107, so point B is at (0, 107).
- Point A, which is opposite to D, will be at (BC, AB) = (16, 107).

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If ABCD is a rectangle, the order of the points is important. If we traverse from A to B to C to D and back to A, each adjacent pair is connected by a side.

If I place D at (0,0), then C is next. Since BC is 16, but BC is the side opposite to AD. Wait, I might be getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to assign coordinates differently.

Let me consider rectangle ABCD with points labeled in order: A, B, C, D. So, sides AB, BC, CD, DA.

In that case, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (a, 0), B at (a, b), and A at (0, b). But wait, that might not fit with the given side lengths.

Wait, given that BC = 16 and AB = 107. So, AB is the vertical side, BC is the horizontal side.

So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (16, 0) because BC = 16. Then, since AB is 107, point B is at (16, 107). Point A would then be at (0, 107).

Wait, let me confirm:

- AB is the vertical side, length 107. So from A(0,107) to B(16,107).
- BC is the horizontal side, length 16, from B(16,107) to C(16,0).
- CD is vertical from C(16,0) to D(0,0). Wait, that would make CD length 16 as well, but that's the same as BC, which makes sense for a rectangle.

Wait, no. If D is at (0,0), and C is at (16,0), then CD is from (16,0) to (0,0), which is 16 units. So that's consistent. Then DA is from D(0,0) to A(0,107), which is 107 units. That makes sense.

So rectangle ABCD has coordinates:
- A(0,107)
- B(16,107)
- C(16,0)
- D(0,0)

Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So the line passes through points D(0,0), E, C(16,0), F.

Wait, since C is at (16,0) and D is at (0,0), the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (16,0). So, points E and F must lie somewhere on this line as well.

But wait, EFGH is another rectangle. Let me think about the structure.

Points E, F, G, H form a rectangle. So, the sides EF, FG, GH, HE are all connected at right angles. Given that EF = 184 and FG =17.

Wait, EF is a side of the rectangle, and FG is another side. So, EF is 184, FG is 17. So, the rectangle EFGH has sides of length 184 and 17.

But wait, EF and FG are adjacent sides, so the rectangle has sides 184 and 17.

But how are E, F, G, H placed? Since E and F are on the line through D, C, E, F, which is the x-axis from (0,0) to (16,0). So E and F are somewhere on the x-axis.

Wait, but if E and F are on the x-axis, then the rectangle EFGH would have two points (E and F) on the x-axis, and G and H somewhere else.

But in the problem statement, it's given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A(0,107), D(0,0), H, and G lie on a circle.

Hmm, so G and H are part of rectangle EFGH. So, let's think about the positions of E, F, G, H.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, and E and F are on the x-axis, then sides EF and FG are the sides of the rectangle. So, EF is 184, which is a horizontal side on the x-axis. Then FG would be a vertical side of length 17.

Wait, but E and F are on the x-axis, so EF is along the x-axis. Then FG would go upwards from F. So, point G would be at (F_x, F_y +
