Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner. The catch is that they have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, interesting.

First, let me make sure I understand the grid. An 8x8 grid, so it's like a chessboard, right? That means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, making 64 squares. But when we talk about paths from the lower left to the upper right, we're moving from (0,0) to (8,8), I think. Wait, no, actually, since it's an 8x8 grid, the coordinates go from (0,0) to (8,8), because each step moves either right or up. So, the number of steps required is 16: 8 right and 8 up.

Each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. So, the total number of paths without any restrictions is C(16,8), which is the binomial coefficient. But this problem adds the condition that the path changes direction exactly four times.

Wait, what's a direction change? So, each time the path switches from moving right to up or vice versa, that's a direction change. For example, if you have RRUU, that's one change from R to U. If you have RURU, that's three changes: R to U, U to R, R to U.

So, changing direction exactly four times means that the path alternates between R and U four times. But wait, how does that translate into the number of runs in the sequence? A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, if we change direction four times, that implies five runs. Because each change adds a new run. For example, two changes would mean three runs.

So, in our case, four direction changes result in five runs. Each run is either a sequence of R's or U's. Now, the path must start with either R or U, right? So, the first run could be R's or U's. But since we're going from (0,0) to (8,8), we need exactly eight R's and eight U's. So, the five runs must consist of three R runs and two U runs, or vice versa.

Wait, let me think. If we have five runs, they alternate between R and U. So, if the first run is R, then the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. That's three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, if the first run is U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U, which is three U runs and two R runs.

So, in either case, the total number of runs is five. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the runs is determined by whether the first run is R or U. Let's denote the two cases:

Case 1: First run is R. Then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.

Case 2: First run is U. Then the runs are U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs.

Therefore, we need to compute the number of paths for each case and sum them.

Wait, but since the grid is symmetric, the number of paths in Case 1 and Case 2 should be the same, right? Because swapping R and U would mirror the grid. So, maybe I can compute one case and double it, but I'm not sure. Let me check.

Wait, no, actually, because the total number of R's and U's is the same, 8 each. So, both cases would have the same number of paths. So, perhaps I can compute one case and then multiply by 2. But let's see.

Alternatively, I can model both cases separately and sum them. Maybe it's safer to do both.

So, let's take Case 1: runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Each R run must have at least one R, same for U runs.

Similarly, in Case 2: runs are U, R, U, R, U. Three U runs and two R runs.

So, for each case, the number of paths is the number of ways to partition the 8 R's into three runs and the 8 U's into two runs, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange these runs. Wait, actually, the arrangement is fixed once we decide the starting direction.

Wait, no. For Case 1, the runs are fixed as R, U, R, U, R. So, the first run is R, then U, etc. So, the number of ways is the number of ways to split 8 R's into three parts (each at least 1) and 8 U's into two parts (each at least 1).

Similarly, for Case 2, split 8 U's into three parts and 8 R's into two parts.

So, the number of ways for each case is [C(7,2) * C(7,1)] because for splitting into k runs, it's C(n-1, k-1). Wait, let me remember: the number of ways to split n identical items into k non-empty groups is C(n-1, k-1). So, for R runs in Case 1: 8 R's into 3 runs. So, it's C(7,2). Similarly, for U runs in Case 1: 8 U's into 2 runs, which is C(7,1).

Similarly, for Case 2: U runs into 3 parts: C(7,2), and R runs into 2 parts: C(7,1).

So, for Case 1: C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 * 7 = 147.

For Case 2: same, 21 * 7 = 147.

So, total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Is each arrangement of runs a unique path? Because each run's length is determined by how we split the R's and U's.

Yes, because each split corresponds to a different sequence of steps. So, for example, in Case 1, splitting R into 1,1,6 would mean the first run is R once, then U once, then R six times, then U once, then R once. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the runs are R, U, R, U, R, but each run must be at least 1. So, the splits for R would be into three parts, each at least 1, and similarly for U into two parts.

So, for example, in Case 1, R is split into a, b, c where a, b, c ≥1 and a + b + c =8. Similarly, U is split into d, e where d, e ≥1 and d + e =8.

Each such split corresponds to a unique path. So, the number of such paths is indeed the number of ways to split R into 3 parts times the number of ways to split U into 2 parts, and same for Case 2.

So, for each case, it's C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 *7=147. So, both cases add to 294.

Wait, but let me think about the direction changes. Each time the direction changes, it's when the run switches. So, in Case 1, with five runs, there are four direction changes, which is exactly what the problem requires.

So, that seems to fit. Therefore, the total number of paths is 294.

But wait a moment. Let me think again. So, the problem says "change direction exactly four times." Each direction change is a switch from R to U or U to R. So, for a path with five runs, there are four direction changes. So, that is correct.

But is there any other way to have exactly four direction changes? Hmm, no. Because the number of direction changes is equal to the number of runs minus one. So, five runs correspond to four direction changes. So, that's exactly what we need.

So, putting it all together, the number of such paths is 294.

Wait, but let me think about another approach to confirm. Maybe using generating functions or something else.

Alternatively, the problem can be modeled as the number of lattice paths with exactly four turns. So, each turn is a direction change.

I recall that in combinatorics, the number of paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with exactly k turns can be calculated using some formula. Let me try to remember.

I think the formula is something like 2 * C(m-1, t) * C(n-1, t), where t is the number of turns, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe not exactly.

Wait, perhaps when you have exactly t turns, you have t+1 runs. So, for each direction, you can model the number of runs.

Wait, perhaps for each direction, it's similar to the way I thought before. So, if the path starts with R, then the number of R runs is t+1 if t is even or something? Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, another approach: The number of paths with exactly k direction changes is equal to 2 * C(r-1, k/2) * C(u-1, k/2) when k is even? No, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe it's better to stick with my initial approach. Because I think I got it right.

Wait, but wait, so in my initial approach, for each case, whether starting with R or U, the number of ways is C(7,2)*C(7,1) = 147 each, summing to 294. So, that's 294 paths.

But let me check for a smaller grid to see if the reasoning holds. Let's take a 2x2 grid. So, from (0,0) to (2,2). The number of paths that change direction exactly once. Hmm.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the total number of paths is 6. The number of paths that change direction exactly once: that's the paths that go right twice and up twice, but arranged as RRUU or UURR. So, that's two paths.

Wait, according to my initial approach: for a 2x2 grid, each path has length 4, with two R's and two U's.

If direction changes exactly once: so, two runs. So, for starting with R, the runs are R, U. Number of ways: split R into one run (2) and U into one run (2). But wait, the number of ways to split R into 1 run is 1, same for U. So, 1*1=1 path starting with R. Similarly, starting with U, 1 path. So, total 2, which matches.

So, that seems correct.

Another test: 3x3 grid, paths with exactly two direction changes.

So, in a 3x3 grid, each path is 6 steps: 3 R's and 3 U's.

Two direction changes correspond to three runs. So, runs can be R, U, R or U, R, U.

Each case: splitting R into 2 runs and U into 1 run, or vice versa.

For starting with R: number of ways to split R into 2 runs: C(2,1) =2. U into 1 run: 1. So, 2*1=2 paths.

Similarly, starting with U: 2*1=2 paths.

Total 4 paths.

Let me count manually. The possible paths with exactly two direction changes.

Starting with R: The first run can be 1 or 2 R's.

If first run is 1 R, then U run can be 1 or 2 U's.

Wait, but in three runs, we have R, U, R.

Wait, for 3 R's and 3 U's:

Case 1: R runs are a and b, where a + b =3, a≥1, b≥1. So, a can be 1 or 2.

Similarly, U runs are c, where c=3.

So, for a=1, b=2: R, U, R. So, R once, U thrice, R twice? Wait, no, U run is only once in this case, because it's split into one run. So, R once, U thrice, R twice? Wait, that's 1+3+2=6, which exceeds.

Wait, no, in the case of starting with R, with two R runs, the splits are a and b, a + b =3, so a=1, b=2 or a=2, b=1.

Similarly, U runs are one run, which is 3.

So, the paths are:

1. R1, U3, R2: R U U U R R

2. R2, U3, R1: R R U U U R

Similarly, starting with U:

U1, R3, U2: U R R R U U

U2, R3, U1: U U R R R U

So, that's four paths, which matches the count from my initial approach. So, which is correct.

So, that gives me more confidence that my initial approach is correct.

Therefore, returning to the 8x8 grid problem, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is 294.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think if there's another way to model this problem.

Another approach: Each time the path changes direction, it's a switch from R to U or U to R. So, the number of direction changes is the number of times the path alternates between R and U.

So, in a path with four direction changes, there are five runs. Each run is a consecutive series of R's or U's.

So, in the case where the path starts with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.

Similarly, starting with U, three U runs and two R runs.

So, in each case, the number of ways is the number of ways to partition 8 R's into three runs and 8 U's into two runs, or vice versa.

Each partition can be computed as combinations:

For R into three runs: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) =21.

For U into two runs: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147 for each case. So, 147*2=294.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, the formula is:

Number of paths = 2 * C(m-1, k) * C(n-1, k-1), where m and n are the number of steps in each direction, and k is the number of runs in one direction.

Wait, not exactly. Wait, in this case, for four direction changes, we have five runs.

If the path starts with R, then it has three R runs and two U runs.

So, the number of ways to split R into three parts is C(7,2) as above, and U into two parts is C(7,1). So, 21 *7 =147.

Similarly, starting with U, it's the same.

So, the formula would be:

If we have a grid of size m x n, and we want the number of paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with exactly t direction changes, then:

If t is even, the number of runs is t+1, which is odd. So, one direction will have (t+2)/2 runs, and the other will have (t)/2 runs.

Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.

Wait, for t direction changes, the number of runs is t+1.

If the path starts with R, then the number of R runs is (t+2)/2 if t is even, and (t+1)/2 if t is odd? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, in our case, t=4, which is even. So, runs are 5. If starting with R, R runs are 3 and U runs are 2.

Similarly, starting with U, U runs are 3 and R runs are 2.

So, in general, for t direction changes, the number of runs is t+1.

If t is even, then the number of R runs is (t+2)/2 and U runs is (t)/2, or vice versa.

Wait, for t=4: (4+2)/2=3 R runs, 4/2=2 U runs.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the formula would be:

Number of paths = 2 * C(m-1, (t+2)/2 -1) * C(n-1, (t)/2 -1 )

Wait, let me test with our problem.

Here, m=8 (R steps), n=8 (U steps), t=4.

So, (t+2)/2=3, so C(m-1, 3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

(t)/2=2, so C(n-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

Multiply them: 21*7=147.

Then multiply by 2: 147*2=294.

Yes, that gives the same result.

So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula.

So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 294.


To solve the problem of finding the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths. Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or vice versa. 

Exactly four direction changes imply five runs (consecutive sequences of the same move). These runs can either start with R or U, leading to two cases:

1. **Case 1: The path starts with R.**  
   The runs alternate as R, U, R, U, R, resulting in three R runs and two U runs.  
   - The number of ways to partition 8 R's into 3 runs is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).  
   - The number of ways to partition 8 U's into 2 runs is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).  
   - Total for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

2. **Case 2: The path starts with U.**  
   The runs alternate as U, R, U, R, U, resulting in three U runs and two R runs.  
   - The number of ways to partition 8 U's into 3 runs is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).  
   - The number of ways to partition 8 R's into 2 runs is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).  
   - Total for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

Summing both cases gives the total number of paths:  
\( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

Thus, the number of such paths is \(\boxed{294}\).
