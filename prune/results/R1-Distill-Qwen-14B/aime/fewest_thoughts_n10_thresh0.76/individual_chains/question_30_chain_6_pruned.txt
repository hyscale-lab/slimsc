Alright, so I've been given this math problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's a 13th root and not equal to 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, ω has order 13. That's important because it might relate to cyclotomic polynomials or properties of roots of unity.

The expression I'm dealing with is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out more clearly:

Product = Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I need to compute this product and then find its remainder modulo 1000.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since ω is a root of unity, maybe there's a way to relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at a certain point. Or perhaps factor it in terms of cyclotomic polynomials.

Wait, cyclotomic polynomials are minimal polynomials over the integers for roots of unity, right? The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is Φ_13(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that ties into this product.

Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite the term inside the product in a more manageable form. Let's look at (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, can I factor this or write it as a power or something?

Let me try to manipulate the expression:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2

Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set z = ω^k. Then the expression becomes z² - 2z + 2.

So, the term is z² - 2z + 2, where z is ω^k.

Therefore, the product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (z² - 2z + 2) evaluated at z = ω^k.

Wait, but z is ω^k, which for k from 0 to 12 gives all the 13th roots of unity.

So, the product is the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for all 13th roots of unity z, except z=1? Wait, no, when k=0, z=ω^0=1. So, I should
