Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon). Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. The diagram shows three examples, but I don't have the visual, so I'll have to imagine it or perhaps sketch some in my mind.

First, I need to understand what a regular dodecagon looks like. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about rectangles formed inside this dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the rectangle's sides are aligned with the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. That probably means that the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon, i.e., connecting two non-adjacent vertices.

Wait, but how exactly do these rectangles form? Let me think. A rectangle requires four points, each pair connected by sides or diagonals. But in a regular polygon, sides and diagonals have specific lengths and angles. So, for a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and all angles must be 90 degrees.

But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals have different lengths. So, the sides of a rectangle can only be certain diagonals or sides of the dodecagon that are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, but the sides of the dodecagon are adjacent vertices. Diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a regular polygon, the length of a diagonal depends on the number of sides it spans.

In a regular dodecagon, the number of distinct diagonals is given by n(n-3)/2. For n=12, that's 12*9/2 = 54. So, 54 diagonals, but some are of the same length.

I think the key here is to realize that for a rectangle to be formed, the sides must be pairs of parallel chords (sides or diagonals) that are perpendicular to each other.

So, perhaps I should model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Then each vertex can be represented by a point on the circumference, spaced at 30-degree increments (since 360/12=30). 

In this model, each vertex is at an angle of 30*k degrees, where k=0,1,2,...,11.

Now, the chords (sides and diagonals) correspond to arcs between these points. For a chord between two vertices, the central angle is 30*k degrees, where k is the number of steps between the vertices. For example, adjacent vertices have a central angle of 30 degrees, next-nearest have 60 degrees, etc., up to 180 degrees for the diameter.

Wait, but in a dodecagon, the maximum chord that
