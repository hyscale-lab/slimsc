Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

So, there are 900 residents total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Then there are other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. Also, everyone owns a candy heart. 

Now, additional information: 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four—so, the candy hearts plus the other three items.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like a problem that involves sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how that works.

Inclusion-exclusion is used to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by considering all possible intersections. The formula for four sets would be a bit complicated, but since we're dealing with exactly two and exactly three, maybe I can approach it differently.

Wait, the problem mentions exactly two and exactly three. So, perhaps I should think about this in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle but adjusted for the overlaps.

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- D = set of residents who own a diamond ring
- G = set of residents who own a golf clubs
- S = set of residents who own a garden spade
- C = set of residents who own candy hearts (which is everyone, so C has 900 elements)

We know that everyone owns C, so C is the universal set here. So, every resident is in C. Therefore, all other sets (D, G, S) are subsets of C.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C is the universal set, this is just |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

The given numbers are:
- |D| = 195
- |G| = 367
- |S| = 562
- |C| = 900
- Number of people owning exactly two items = 437
- Number owning exactly three items = 234
