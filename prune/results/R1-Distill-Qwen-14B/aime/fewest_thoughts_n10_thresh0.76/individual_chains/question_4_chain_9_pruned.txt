Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with tokens. The rules are that they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make Bob the winner, no matter how Alice plays. Hmm, okay.

Let me start by understanding the game mechanics. Alice goes first, so the initial move is hers. Each turn, a player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. So, the possible moves from any given n are n-1 and n-4, as long as those numbers are non-negative.

I think the key here is to figure out which positions are winning and which are losing. A losing position is one where no matter what move you make, the opponent can force a win. Conversely, a winning position is one where you can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position.

Let me try to model this with some small n values and see if I can spot a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who would then take it and win. Wait, no. Wait, n=2. Alice can take 1, leaving 1. Bob's turn: he can take 1 and win. So Alice would lose if she takes 1. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So her only move is to take 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, no. Wait, when n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So n=2 would be a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So for n=2, the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally. So if Alice is at n=2, she will lose because whatever she does, Bob can win. Wait, so n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So for Alice, starting at n=2, she can't win. So Bob can force a win. So n=2 is
