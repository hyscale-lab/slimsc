Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, okay, let's break down what a b-eautiful number is.

A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

Wait, so if n is a two-digit number in base b, that means n can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. So, a must be between 1 and b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c must be between 0 and b-1.

Also, the sum of the digits a + c should equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, right? So, n must be a perfect square.

So, let's formalize this. Let n = a * b + c. Then, sqrt(n) = a + c. Therefore, n = (a + c)^2.

So, we have a * b + c = (a + c)^2. Let's rearrange this equation to find a relationship between a, c, and b.

Expanding the right side: (a + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

So, a * b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

Let's bring all terms to one side: a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe we can express b in terms of a and c. Let's try that.

From a * b + c = (a + c)^2, solving for b gives:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a.

Simplify that: (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

Wait, since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, this expression must result in an integer. Therefore, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. Let's write that condition:

a | (c^2 - c) => a divides c(c - 1).

Since a and c are digits in base b, a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

But since a is the leading digit, it's at least 1 and at most b-1. So, for a given base b, a can range from 1 to b-1, and c can range from 0 to b-1.

But wait, we're trying to find bases b where there are multiple such n. The problem states that we need more than ten b-eautiful integers, so we need more than ten pairs (a, c) such that a * b + c = (a + c)^2, and a and c satisfy the digit constraints.

So, perhaps we can fix a and c, then solve for b, and then see for each b how many pairs (a, c) satisfy the equation.

Alternatively, since we need to find the minimal b where the number of solutions exceeds ten, maybe we can model this equation to find for each b, the number of valid (a, c) pairs.

Let me think. Let's define variables:

Let s = a + c. Then, n = s^2, and n = a * b + c.

So, s^2 = a * b + c.

But since c = s - a, substituting:

s^2 = a * b + (s - a).

Rearranging:

s^2 - s + a = a * b.

So, b = (s^2 - s + a) / a.
