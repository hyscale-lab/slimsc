Okay, I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down.

First off, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially cyclotomic polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. The cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x) is equal to the product of (x - ω^k) for k from 1 to 12, because ω^0 = 1 and it's not included since Φ₁₃(x) is for primitive roots.

But wait, in the problem, we're dealing with a product that involves 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. I need to evaluate the product for k from 0 to 12. Let me write down the product:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm, that's a product over all 13th roots of unity, including ω^0 = 1. I wonder if I can relate this product to the cyclotomic polynomial or some other polynomial evaluated at a specific value.

Let me try to rewrite the expression inside the product. Let's see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}

Alternatively, maybe factor it differently. Let me see if I can write it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x². So, 2 - 2x + x² = x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic equation.

So, the product becomes P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k. So, P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2)

Wait a second, that's the same as ∏_{k=0}^{12} ( (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2 )

But since ω^k are the 13th roots of unity, each term in the product is a quadratic evaluated at each root.

I remember that if you have a polynomial f(x) and you take the product of f(ω^k) for all k from 0 to 12, that's equivalent to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 - 1, but maybe that's too abstract.

Alternatively, I know that the product of (x - ω^k) for k from 0 to 12 is x^13 - 1 because it's the factorization of x^13 - 1. But in our case, the product is over (a quadratic evaluated at ω^k). So, maybe I can relate this to evaluating another polynomial at a specific value.

Wait, let's think: If f(x) = x² - 2x + 2, then ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). But since ω^k runs through all 13th roots of unity, including 1, maybe this product relates to the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at the roots.

Alternatively, I can note that ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if I can relate the product of f(ω^k) to the product over (x - ω^k), but f(x) is a quadratic, not linear. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product P is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of f(ω^k), where f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Then, I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all n-th roots of unity of f(ω^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1, which might be complex, but maybe
