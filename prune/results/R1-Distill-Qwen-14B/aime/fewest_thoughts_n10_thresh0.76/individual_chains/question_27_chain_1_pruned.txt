Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the problem describes a torus T. It says that T is formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, I remember that a torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an external axis.

I think the standard way to describe a torus is using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So, that makes sense.

Now, the problem introduces a sphere S with radius 11. So, S is just a regular sphere, and we're comparing the torus T to this sphere in two scenarios: when T is inside S and tangent internally, and when T is outside S and tangent externally. In each case, the tangency is along a circle, and we need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

Let me visualize both situations.

1. **Internal Tangency (T inside S):** Here, the torus T is resting on the inside of the sphere S. So, the outer surface of T is touching the inner surface of S along a circle. The point of tangency is a single circle on both surfaces.

2. **External Tangency (T outside S):** In this case, T is outside S, and they touch along another circle. The sphere S is inside the torus T, touching it along a circle.

I need to find the radii of these two circles, r_i and r_o, and then find r_i - r_o.

I think the key here is to figure out the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in both cases, and then use some geometry to find the radii of the tangent circles.

Wait, but how are the centers related here? The sphere S has its own center, and the torus T is generated by revolving around an axis. But when we place T inside or outside S, the centers might be different.

Wait, actually, when T is inside S, the center of S is probably at the same point as the center of the torus. Because otherwise, the torus would be shifted, but the problem doesn't mention any shifting. Similarly, when T is outside S, the sphere is probably inside the torus, and their centers coincide.

So, I can assume that the centers of the sphere S and the torus T are the same point. That simplifies things.

Now, let's model the torus mathematically.

A torus can be described parametrically, but perhaps it's easier to use the equation in 3D coordinates. The standard equation for a torus with major radius R and minor radius r is:

√(x² + y²
