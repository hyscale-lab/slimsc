Okay, I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that any complex number z can be written in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ}, since the magnitude |z| is 4. So θ is the argument of z, which can vary between 0 and 2π. That might simplify things because dealing with exponentials might be easier than dealing with the rectangular form.

Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since 1/z has magnitude 1/4 and the negative of the argument.

So substituting back into the original expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First part: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}

75 * 4 is 300, and 117 * 4 is 468. So this becomes (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.

Second part: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So this becomes (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression is (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, my goal is to find the real part of this expression and maximize it. So let me compute the real part.

I can write each term as a product of a complex number and e^{iθ} or e^{-iθ}. Let me expand them using Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Let me multiply these out.

Starting with the first term:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i

Similarly for the second term:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so this becomes:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i

Now, let's add the real parts from both terms and the imaginary parts from both terms.

Real parts total: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts total: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i
= (300 sinθ -24 sinθ) i + (468 cosθ + 36 cosθ) i
= 276 sinθ i + 504 cosθ i
= (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i

So the entire expression is:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i

But we only care about the real part, which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So now, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of the real part, which is the expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, how do I find the maximum of this expression? I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is |C|.

Wait, but in this case, the expression is A cosθ + B sinθ, but with A positive and B negative. Let me write it as 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I can factor out a common factor to make it simpler. Let's see, 324 and 432 are both divisible by 36. 324 ÷ 36 = 9, 432 ÷ 36 = 12. So I can factor out 36:

36*(9 cosθ - 12 sinθ)

So the expression is 36*(9 cosθ - 12 sinθ). Now, the maximum value of (9 cosθ -12 sinθ) is sqrt(9^2 + (-12)^2) because the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, actually, more precisely, the maximum is sqrt(A^2 + B^2), regardless of the sign.

So sqrt(9^2 + 12^2) = sqrt(81 + 144) = sqrt(225) = 15.

Therefore, the maximum value of (9 cosθ - 12 sinθ) is 15, so the maximum of the entire expression is 36*15 = 540.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Since the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is equal to 36*(9 cosθ - 12 sinθ), and the maximum of (9 cosθ -12 sinθ)
