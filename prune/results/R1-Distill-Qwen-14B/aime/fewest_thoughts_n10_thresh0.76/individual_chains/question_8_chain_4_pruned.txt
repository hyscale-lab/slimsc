Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me first understand what the problem is asking. I need to find all possible triples (a, b, c) where each of a, b, c is a nonnegative integer, their sum is 300, and the sum of these terms involving their squares and products is 6,000,000.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I think it might help to manipulate these equations to find a relationship between a, b, and c.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Let me factor out the common terms. For the first part, a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, the next two terms, b²a + b²c, can be factored as b²(a + c), and the last two terms, c²a + c²b, can be factored as c²(a + b). So the equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that looks better. Since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me try that.

So substituting:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can find another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can use symmetric sums or other algebraic identities to simplify this.

I recall that (a + b + c)^3 can be expanded, but I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can express a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b in terms of symmetric sums.

Wait, let me consider the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I can factor each term as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) which is what I did earlier.

Alternatively, I can factor this expression as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Let me check that.

Yes, because:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 3abc.

So subtracting 3abc gives a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + ac² + bc², which is exactly the expression we have.

So, a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Given that a + b + c = 300, this becomes:

300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me write that:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

I can factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's a simpler equation. Let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. So the equation becomes:

100P - Q = 2,000,000.

But I also know that S = 300, P is the sum of products, and Q is the product.

Wait, perhaps I can express this in terms of S, P, and Q.

I think I can relate it using the identity for cubic
