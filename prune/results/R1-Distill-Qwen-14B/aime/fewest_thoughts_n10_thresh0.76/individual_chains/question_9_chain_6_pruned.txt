Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have two logarithmic equations:

1. log base x of (y^x) equals 10.
2. log base y of (x^{4y}) equals 10.

And we need to find the product xy where both x and y are greater than 1.

Hmm, let me recall some logarithm properties. I know that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite both equations in exponential form.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Converting this, it should be x^10 = y^x. Right? Because the base x raised to the power 10 equals y^x.

Wait, let me check that again. Remember, log_x(y^x) = 10 means that x^10 = y^x. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, converting this, it should be y^10 = x^{4y}. Because the base y raised to 10 equals x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x.
2. y^10 = x^{4y}.

Hmm, okay. So maybe I can express both equations in terms of x and y and then find a relationship between them.

Let me think about taking logarithms of both sides to make it easier. Or perhaps express y in terms of x from one equation and substitute into the other.

Starting with the first equation: x^{10} = y^x.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponents.

ln(x^{10}) = ln(y^x).

Which simplifies to 10 ln x = x ln y.

So equation (1a): 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation: y^{10} = x^{4y}.

Take natural log: ln(y^{10}) = ln(x^{4y}).

Which becomes 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Equation (2a): 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Hmm, so now I have two equations:

(1a) 10 ln x = x ln y.

(2a) 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

I can maybe solve one equation for ln y and substitute into the other.

From (1a): ln y = (10 ln x) / x.

Substitute this into (2a):

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

Simplify left side: 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, both sides have ln x. Assuming ln x is not zero (which it can't be since x >1, so ln x >0), we can divide both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y.

So 100/(x) =4y → y = 25 / x.

So we have y = 25/x. Okay, that relates y and x.

Now let's substitute y =25/x into one of the original equations. Let's pick equation (1a): 10 ln x = x ln y.

Express ln y as ln(25/x) = ln25 - lnx.

So equation (1a) becomes:

10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x).

Let me write that out:

10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 =0.

Factor out ln x:

ln x (10 +x) -x ln25 =0.

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

ln x (10 +x) = x ln25.

So ln x = (x ln25)/(10 +x).

Hmm, that seems manageable.

Alternatively, maybe we can express x in terms of y or vice versa, but let's see.

Wait, perhaps I can substitute y =25/x into another equation. Let's try equation (1): x^10 = y^x.

So x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Which is x^10 =25^x /x^x.

Multiply both sides by x^x to get:

x^{10 +x} =25^x.

So x^{x +10} =25^x.

Take both sides to the power of 1/x:

x^{(x +10)/x} =25.

Simplify exponent: (x+10)/x = 1 + 10/x.

So x^{1 +10/x} =25.

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of x.

Wait, let me write it as:

x * x^{10/x} =25.

Hmm, can I let t = x^{1/x}? Because t is a common substitution when dealing with exponents and variables in exponents.

Wait, x^{1/x} is a function that has a maximum at x=e, but perhaps that route will complicate things. Let me think.

Alternatively, take natural log of both sides:

ln(x * x^{10/x}) ) = ln25.

Which is ln x + (10/x) ln x = ln25.

Factor ln x:

ln x (1 +10/x) = ln25.

Hmm, okay. So:

ln x ( (x +10)/x ) = ln25.

So ln x = (x ln25)/(x +10), which matches what I had earlier. So that's consistent.

So I have that ln x = (x ln25)/(x +10).

Hmm. So I need to solve for x.

This seems a bit tricky because x is both in the exponent and multiplied. Maybe I can make a substitution.

Let me set z = x +10. Then x = z -10.

Wait, let's see:

ln(z -10) = ( (z -10) ln25 ) / z.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me think about possible integer values for x and y since the answer is likely an integer.

Wait, looking back, we have y =25/x. So if x is 5, y would be 5. Let me check if that works.

If x=5, y=5.

Check first equation: log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) =5. But the problem says it's equal to 10. So that's not right.

Hmm, maybe x=25, then y=1. But y has to be greater than 1, so that's not acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe x= 25^{1/ something}.

Wait, another approach. Let me take the two original equations:

1. x^10 = y^x.

2. y^10 =x^{4y}.

And since we have y=25/x, let's substitute that into the second equation.

So substituting y=25/x into equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

So (25/x)^10 =x^{4*(25/x)}.

Simplify left side: 25^10 /x^{10}.

Right side: x^{100/x}.

So equation is 25^10 /x^{10} =x^{100/x}.

Multiply both sides by x^{10}:

25^10 =x^{10 +100/x}.

So 25^10 =x^{ (10x +100)/x }.

Take natural logs:

ln(25^10) = ln(x^{(10x +100)/x}).

Which is 10 ln25 = (10x +100)/x * lnx.

Simplify RHS: (10x +100)/x =10 + 100/x.

So 10 ln25 = (10 + 100/x) ln x.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, maybe we can write this as:

(10 +100/x) lnx =10 ln25.

Divide both sides by 10:

(1 +10/x) lnx = ln25.

So lnx = (ln25)/(1 +10/x).

Hmm, perhaps make substitution t = lnx.

Then, x = e^t.

So let's substitute:

t = (ln25)/(1 +10/e^t).

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. But maybe we can find a value for t that satisfies this.

Alternatively, perhaps let me think if x is 25. Let me check:

If x=25, then from y=25/x, y=1. But y must be greater than 1, so that's not allowed.

Wait, but x=5, as I tried earlier, gives y=5, but that didn't work. Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, if x=5, then from equation 1: x^10 = y^x →5^10= y^5. So y=5^(10/5)=5^2=25.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought y=5, but that was incorrect. So if x=5, then y=25.

Wait, that's different. So let me correct that.

Wait, no, original substitution was y=25/x. So if x=5, y=5. But wait, that contradicts the first equation.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.

Wait, when I substituted y=25/x into the first equation, I should get x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Wait, when x=5:

Left side:5^10= 9765625.

Right side: (25/5)^5=5^5=3125.

So 9765625 ≠3125. So x=5 doesn't work.

So perhaps x=25/x, but then x^2=25 →x=
