Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

The list of positive integers has three properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. 

First, let's recall what each term means:

- **Sum**: The total when all numbers are added together. Here, it's 30.

- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, so only 9 appears more times than any other number.

- **Median**: The middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of items, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, if the median is an average, it must be between two numbers, right?

Wait, no. If the median is an integer and doesn't appear in the list, that implies that the two middle numbers must average to an integer that's not present. Let me think about that.

Hmm, okay. So, let's start by considering the mode. The mode is 9, and it's unique. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. So, the other numbers can appear at most as many times as 9 minus one.

Now, the sum is 30. So, the numbers in the list add up to 30.

Also, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if the median is between two numbers, say, a and b, then (a + b)/2 is an integer, let's say m, and m is not in the list.

Wait, but if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the median is an integer, then the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd so their sum is even. But in this case, the median is an integer not present in the list.

So, let's think about the possible number of elements in the list. Since the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, the list must have at least 1 number (but that's impossible because the sum would be 30, which is the only number, but then the median would be 30, which is the same as the number, but the problem says the median doesn't appear in the list. So, the list can't have only one number.

Wait, no. Let's see: If the list has an odd number of elements, say n=2k+1, then the median is the (k+1)th term. If the median is an integer not in the list, that would mean that the (k+1)th term is m, which is not present in the list.

But all the numbers in the list are positive integers, and the mode is 9. So, 9 has to appear more times than any other number.

Let me think about the possible lengths of the list.

The sum is 30, and each number is at least 1. So, the maximum possible number of elements is 30 (all 1s), but that's probably too many. Since the mode is 9, which is a relatively large number, the list can't have too many elements because the sum is only 30.

Wait, let's see: if 9 is the mode, it has to appear at least twice (if all others appear once), but since it's the unique mode, it has to appear more than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times.

But wait, let me think. Suppose another
