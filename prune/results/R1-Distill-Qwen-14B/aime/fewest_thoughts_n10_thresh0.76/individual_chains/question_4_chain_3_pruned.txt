Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about this. It seems like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of the opponent's moves, while a losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

So, in this case, the starting player is Alice. Bob wants to have a strategy that ensures he can win regardless of Alice's moves. That means for certain values of n, Bob can always respond in a way that leads him to victory. So I need to find all such n up to 2024 where Bob can force a win.

Let me try to model the game. Let's think recursively. For each number of tokens, we can determine if it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position for the player whose turn it is.

The base case is when there are 0 tokens left. That means the previous player has taken the last token and won, so the current player loses. So n=0 is a losing position.

Now, for n=1: the current player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position (W).

n=2: current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. Wait, but if the opponent is faced with n=1, which is a W position, they can take the last token and win. Oh, wait, no—Wait, the current player at n=2 can take 1 token, leaving n=1. Then the opponent can take that 1 and win. Alternatively, the current player could take 4 tokens, but wait, there are only 2, so that's not possible. So for n=2, the current player can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then win. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So n=2 is L.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me
