Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number is a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its two digits equals the square root of the number itself.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's understand what a two-digit number in base b looks like. A two-digit number in base b would be something like "xy" where x is the digit in the b's place and y is the digit in the units place. So, in decimal, that would be x*b + y.

Given that, the number n in base 10 is x*b + y. The sum of the digits is x + y, and this sum equals the square root of n. So, the condition is that x + y = sqrt(n) = sqrt(x*b + y). 

Wait, so if I square both sides, I get (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. Let me write that equation down:

(x + y)^2 = x*b + y.

I can expand the left side:

x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = x*b + y.

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - x*b - y = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a better way to express it. Let's see:

Alternatively, I can write (x + y)^2 = x*b + y as:

x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = x*b + y.

Hmm, perhaps grouping terms:

x^2 - x*b + 2xy + y^2 - y = 0.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can write it in terms of x and y.

Alternatively, let me try to express b in terms of x and y.

Starting from (x + y)^2 = x*b + y,

So,

x*b = (x + y)^2 - y,

Therefore,

b = [(x + y)^2 - y]/x.

Simplify that:

b = [(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) - y]/x

= [x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - y]/x

= x + 2y + (y^2 - y)/x.

Hmm, since b has to be an integer, the term (y^2 - y)/x must be an integer as well. Because x and y are digits in base b, so x must be at least 1 (since it's the leading digit of a two-digit number) and at most b-1. Similarly, y can be from 0 to b-1.

Wait, another way to think about this: Since x and y are digits in base b, x ranges from 1 to b-1, and y ranges from 0 to b-1.

So, for each base b, we can look for pairs (x,y) such that x + y = sqrt(x*b + y), and then count how many such pairs exist for each b. We need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

But this might be computationally intensive if I have to check each base one by one. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the equation again:

(x + y)^2 = x*b + y.

Let me denote s = x + y. Then, s^2 = x*b + y.

But since s = x + y, we can write y = s - x.

Substituting into the equation:

s^2 = x*b + (s - x).

Simplify:

s^2 = x*b + s - x

= s + x*(b - 1).

So,

s^2 - s = x*(b - 1).

Therefore,

x = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1).

But x must be a positive integer, and since x is the leading digit in base b, x must be at least 1 and at most b-1.

So, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and x must satisfy 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1.

Also, y = s - x must satisfy 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1.

So, for each s, we can compute x as (s^2 - s)/(b - 1), and then check if x is an integer within 1 to b-1, and that y = s - x is also within 0 to b-1.

Wait, but s = x + y, so s must be at least 1 (since x is at least 1 and y is at least 0) and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.

But s is the square root of n, which is a two-digit number in base b. The smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1. So sqrt(n) must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 -1), which is between about sqrt(b) and just below b.

Wait, so s = sqrt(n) must satisfy sqrt(b) ≤ s < b, because n is at most b^2 -1, so sqrt(n) is less than b.

So s is an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1.

Wait, because s must be an integer since x and y are integers. So s must be an integer.

Wait, no, wait a second: x and y are integers, so s = x + y is an integer. So s must be an integer.

But sqrt(n) is equal to s, so n = s^2.

Therefore, n must be a perfect square, and s must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1.

Wait, let's correct that. The two-digit number in base b is n = x*b + y.

n must be a perfect square, and s = sqrt(n) must be an integer. So n is s^2, and s must be an integer.

Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b^2 -1. So s^2 is between b and b^2 -
