Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Let me draw rectangle ABCD. Let's say ABCD has AB as the top side, BC as the right side, CD as the bottom side, and DA as the left side. So, AB is 107 units long, BC is 16 units. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle; I'm not sure where it's placed yet.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, these four points lie on a straight line. Let me think about how the rectangles could be placed. Since D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, and F is a corner of EFGH, perhaps EFGH is placed such that one of its sides is along the line DC extended. Hmm.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, the four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Maybe this can give us some information about the angles or distances.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Rectangle ABCD: points A, B, C, D in order, so AD is vertical (since BC is vertical with length 16, so AD is also 16). AB is horizontal with length 107, so CD is also 107. Now, rectangle EFGH: since FG = 17 and EF = 184, which are the sides of the rectangle. So, EF is 184, FG is 17. So, sides EF and GH are 184, and sides FG and EH are 17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E and F are on the line passing through D and C. Let me consider this line. Since D is a corner of ABCD, and C is the opposite corner, the line DC is the base of the rectangle. So, points E and F are on this line. So, the rectangle EFGH is somehow attached along the line DC.

Wait, but since EFGH is a rectangle, and E and F are on DC, perhaps EFGH is placed such that one of its sides is along DC? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe EFGH is placed such that E is on DC, and F is also on DC, with E and F extending beyond the rectangle.

Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order is D, E, C, F along a straight line. So, starting from D, going through E, then C, then F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

So, the line goes D-E-C-F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C on the same line.

So, since D is a corner of ABCD, which is a rectangle, the side DC is of length 107. So, DC is 107 units long.

Now, the line DC has points E and F on it, with E between D and C, and F beyond C. So, the distance from D to E is some value, E to C is another, and C to F is another.

Given that, perhaps we can assign variables to these segments.

Let me denote DE = x, EC = y, and CF = z. So, the total distance from D to F would be x + y + z. But maybe that's getting ahead of myself.

Now, considering the other rectangle EFGH. Since E and F are on DC, and EFGH is a rectangle, then the sides EF and FG are the sides of the rectangle. So, EF is 184 and FG is 17.

Wait, EF is a side of EFGH, so EF would be one side, and FG is another. So, EFGH is a rectangle with sides 184 and 17.

But since E and F are on DC, the line where DC is, the rectangle EFGH must be constructed such that EF is along DC, and FG is perpendicular to DC. So, FG would be a vertical side if DC is horizontal.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, DC is horizontal because AB is horizontal (AB = 107). So, DC is also horizontal. So, FG, being a side of EFGH, which is a rectangle, would be vertical.

Wait, but EFGH is a
