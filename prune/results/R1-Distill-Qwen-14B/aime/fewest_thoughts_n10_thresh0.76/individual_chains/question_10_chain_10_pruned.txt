Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me parse this. So, set A is chosen by Alice. Then Bob considers all finite non-empty sets B where each B has a maximum element that's in A. The total number of such B is 2024. We need to find the sum of elements in A.

Wait, so the problem is about counting the number of finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element is in A. So, for each element a in A, how many such sets B have maximum a?

Let me think. For a given a in A, the sets B with maximum a must be subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} where the maximum is a. So, the number of such sets is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because the maximum is a, so we can include any combination of the smaller elements along with a.

Each subset corresponds to a set B. So, for each a in A, the number of such sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Because the number of subsets of a set with (a-1) elements is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, is that right? Let me check. If a is 1, then the only set is {1}, so 1 set, which is 2^{0}=1. If a is 2, the sets are {1,2} and {2}, so 2 sets, which is 2^{1}=2. If a is 3, the sets are all subsets that include 3 and any combination of 1 and 2. There are 2^2=4 sets. Yeah, that works. So, for each a in A, the number of such B is 2^{a-1}.

So, if A has elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. And this sum is 2024.

So, the equation we have is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of the elements of A, i.e., sum_{a in A} a.

So, first, we need to find all possible sets A where the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A is 2024. Then, compute the sum of a in A.

Wait, but 2024 is a specific number. Let me see what 2024 is in terms of powers of 2. Let me compute 2^10: 1024, 2^11: 2048. So 2024 is between 2^10 and 2^11.

Wait, 2024 is 2048 - 24, which is 2048 - 16 -
