Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and that segment IA is perpendicular to segment OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties about triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius 13. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's the center of the inscribed circle with radius 6.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this. Although I can't draw here, I can imagine triangle ABC with O and I somewhere inside. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the line from I to A forms a right angle with the line from O to I.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me calculate that.

Given R = 13 and r = 6,

OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*1 = 13

So OI = sqrt(13). 

Wait, but in the problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. So in triangle OIA, we have:

OI² + IA² = OA²

Because in a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs equals the square of the hypotenuse.

We know OI is sqrt(13), and OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So let's plug in the numbers.

(√13)² + IA² = 13²

13 + IA² = 169

IA² = 169 -13 = 156

So IA = sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39)

Alright, so IA is twice the square root of 39. 

Now, I need to find AB * AC. I remember that in a triangle, the length of the angle bisector can be related to the sides, but IA is the inradius along the angle bisector. Wait, no, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A, which is along the angle bisector. 

I think there's a formula for the length of the inradius in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let me recall. The inradius r is given by r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. But I don't know the semiperimeter yet.

Alternatively, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Let me see if that's correct.

Yes, I think that is a formula. The distance from the incenter to a vertex is equal to r divided by the sine of half the angle at that vertex. So IA = r / sin(A/2). 

Given that IA = 2*sqrt(39) and r = 6,

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)

So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = 3*sqrt(39) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13

So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Hmm, maybe I can find cos(A/2) from this. Since sin²θ + cos²θ =1,

cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39)/(169) = (169 -39)/169 = 130/169

So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. Since A is an angle in a triangle, A/2 is between 0 and 90 degrees, so cos is positive.

Now, I also remember that in a triangle, the sides are related to the angles through the Law of Sines. Let me denote the sides as a, b, c, opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. So, a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. Wait, actually, standard notation is a opposite A, b opposite B, c opposite C. So it's a = BC, b = AC, c = AB.

Wait, but the problem asks for AB * AC, which is c * b.

From the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A, where R is the circumradius. So a = 2*13*sin A = 26 sin A.
