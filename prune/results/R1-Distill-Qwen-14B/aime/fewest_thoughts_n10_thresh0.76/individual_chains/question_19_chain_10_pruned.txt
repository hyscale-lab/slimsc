Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the circumradius is 13 and the inradius is 6. Also, the incenter I is perpendicular to the circumcenter O, specifically IA is perpendicular to OI. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the area. The formula is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. The inradius r is given by r = Δ/s, where s is the semi-perimeter, (a+b+c)/2.

Given that R is 13 and r is 6, maybe I can find some relationship between the sides. Also, the condition IA perpendicular to OI might be key here. I'm not exactly sure how that plays in, but perhaps it relates to some properties of the triangle or the positions of I and O.

I recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and the circumcenter is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Yes, I think that's correct. So if that's the case, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1=13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm.

But in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. That must mean that triangle OIA is a right triangle, with the right angle at I. So in triangle OIA, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. Let's denote some variables.

Let me denote OI as d. So from earlier, d² = 13. So d = sqrt(13). Then, in triangle OIA, since IA is perpendicular to OI, OA² = OI² + IA². Wait, OA is the circumradius, so OA is 13. IA is the length from the inradius to A, which is the ex-radius? Or wait, IA is just the distance from incenter I to vertex A.

Wait, no, IA is the inradius? No, the inradius is the distance from I to any side, not to a vertex. So IA is actually the length of the segment from the incenter to vertex A, which is not necessarily equal to the inradius.

So, in triangle OIA, OA is 13, OI is sqrt(13), IA is perpendicular to OI, so by Pythagoras, OA² = OI² + IA². Plugging in the numbers: 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA². So 169 = 13 + IA². So IA² = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Hmm, that's something.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Maybe using trigonometric identities. Let me think.

The formula for IA is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). Wait, is
