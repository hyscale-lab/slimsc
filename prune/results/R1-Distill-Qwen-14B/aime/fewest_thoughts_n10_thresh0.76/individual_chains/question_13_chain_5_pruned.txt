Okay, so I have this problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Every morning, Aya walks for 9 kilometers and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios where she walks at different speeds, and I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed that's halfway between her original speed and the increased speed. Also, the time includes the coffee shop time, which is the same in both scenarios.

Let me break it down. First, let's list out the given information:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at (s + 2) km/h, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

We need to find the total time when she walks at (s + 1/2) km/h, including the t minutes again.

Hmm, so the key here is to find s and t first, right? Because once I know those, I can calculate the time for the new speed.

Let's think about how to model this. The total time for each walk is the time spent walking plus the time spent in the coffee shop. 

Since the distance is the same in both cases (9 km), we can write equations based on the time she spends walking.

Wait, but the time also includes the coffee shop time, so I need to include that in the equations.

So, for the first scenario:
Total time = walking time + coffee time
4 hours = walking time + t minutes

Similarly, for the second scenario:
2 hours 24 minutes = walking time + t minutes

But wait, the units for time are in hours and minutes. Maybe I should convert everything to hours or minutes to make it consistent. Let's go with hours since the speed is given in km per hour.

So, 4 hours is already in hours.

2 hours and 24 minutes: 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.

Now, let's represent the walking time. Walking time is distance divided by speed. So for the first case, walking time is 9/s hours, and for the second case, it's 9/(s+2) hours.

So, putting it into equations:

First equation:
Walking time + coffee time = 4 hours
9/s + t = 4

Wait, but t is in minutes. Oh, right, that's a problem. Because in the first equation, 4 hours is in hours, but t is given in minutes. So I need to convert t to hours or convert 4 hours to minutes.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's written as t minutes, so maybe it's better to convert the total time into minutes as well.

Let me try that approach. So:

First scenario:
Total time = 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
Walking time + coffee time = 240
Walking time is 9 km / s km/h, which is 9/s hours. To convert to minutes, multiply by 60: (9/s) * 60 minutes.
So, equation 1: (9/s)*60 + t = 240

Second scenario:
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = (2*60 +24) = 144 minutes
Walking time is 9/(s+2) hours, which is (9/(s+2))*60 minutes.
Equation 2: (9/(s+2))*60 + t = 144

Now, we have two equations with two variables, s and t. Let's write them:

1. (540)/s + t = 240
2. (540)/(s+2) + t = 144

So, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1 might help eliminate t.

Equation 1 - Equation 2:
(540/s) - (540/(s+2)) = 240 - 144
(540/s) - (540/(s+2)) = 96

Let me compute the left side:

540 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 96

Factor 540:
540 * [ (s+2 - s) / (s(s+2)) ] = 96
540 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 96

Simplify:
(540 * 2) / [s(s+2)] = 96
1080 / [s(s+2)] = 96

Now, let's solve for s(s+2):

s(s+2) = 1080 / 96
Calculate 1080 / 96:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 90 / 8 = 11.25

So, s(s+2) = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

That's a quadratic equation. Let's solve for s.

Quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 -4ac)] / 2a

Here, a = 1, b=2, c= -11.25.

Discriminant: b^2 -4ac = 4 + 45 = 49

sqrt(49) =7

So, s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:

s = (5)/2 = 2.5

s = (-9)/2 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

So, s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, we can find t from one of the equations. Let's take equation 1:

540/s + t = 240

s=2.5, so 540 / 2.5 = 216

So, 216 + t = 240 => t=2
