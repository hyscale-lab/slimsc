Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let's visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So moving from the lower left (which I'll consider as (0,0)) to the upper right (8,8)) requires moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up. Therefore, the total number of steps is 16, which makes sense because the problem mentions paths of length 16.

Now, the key part is that the path changes direction exactly four times. I think direction changes happen when you switch from moving right to up or up to right. For example, if you move right a few times, then switch to up, that's one direction change. So, in this problem, each time the path switches between right and up, that's a direction change.

Let me think: How do direction changes relate to the number of segments in the path? Each time you change direction, you start a new segment. So, if you have four direction changes, how many segments does that result in?

Wait, if you start moving right, then change direction once to up, then change back to right (that's two changes), and so on. Hmm, so each direction change alternates the direction. So, starting with right, each change flips the direction. So, for four direction changes, how many segments?

Let me model this. Suppose the path starts moving right. Then a direction change would switch to up, that's the first change. Then another change would switch back to right, that's the second. Then third change to up, fourth change back to right. So, after four changes, the path ends with the same direction it started? No, wait, starting with right, after four changes, since each change flips, it would be right -> up -> right -> up -> right. So, the last segment is right. But the endpoint is (8,8), which requires that the last step must be either right or up. Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, to reach (8,8), you must have 8 rights and 8 ups. So, the last move could be either, depending on how you arrange the steps.

Wait, but actually, the path must end at (8,8). So, the number of right steps is 8 and up steps is 8. So, the last step could be right or up. But in the context of direction changes, perhaps the number of direction changes affects how we partition the steps.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the path as a sequence of horizontal and vertical segments. Each time you change direction, you start a new segment. So, if you have four direction changes, how many segments would that be? Let's see, starting with direction right, then each change alternates. So, direction changes are between segments. So, the number of segments is equal to the number of direction changes plus one. Because the first segment is one direction, then each change adds another segment.

So, for four direction changes, there would be five segments. Because the first segment, then four changes lead to five segments. Wait
