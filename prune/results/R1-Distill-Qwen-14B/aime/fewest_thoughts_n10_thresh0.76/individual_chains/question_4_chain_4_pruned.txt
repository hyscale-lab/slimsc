Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like a game theory problem, probably involving winning and losing positions. I remember in such games, certain positions are called losing positions because no matter what move the player makes, the opponent can always win. So, if Bob can force Alice into a losing position, he can win.

Let me think about the possible moves. Each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. So, from any position n, the next player can move to n-1 or n-4, provided those are non-negative.

I think I should start by analyzing small values of n and see if there's a pattern. Let's list out the outcomes for n=1,2,3,4,... and see if a pattern emerges.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, Bob can't win here. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. But wait, when Bob faces n=1, he can take it and win. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Alice goes first. So, n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 token for Bob. But Bob can then take that 1 token and win. So, if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. But wait, maybe Alice can take 1 or 4. But n=2, she can't take 4. So, she can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So, in this case, Bob can win if Alice is forced to leave him with 1. Wait, but Alice is the first player. So, for n=2, Alice has no choice but to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So, n=2 is a winning position for Bob? No, wait, no. Wait, no, Bob is the second player. So, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins.
