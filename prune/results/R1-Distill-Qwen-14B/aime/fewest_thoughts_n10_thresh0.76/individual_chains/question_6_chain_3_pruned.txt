Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of two equations: 

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)

Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the functions f and g are. The problem defines \( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \) and \( g(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{4}| \). So both are absolute value functions with some transformations.

Let me sketch out what these functions look like.

Starting with \( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \). The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape graph with its vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so that would shift the graph down by 1/2. So the vertex would be at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value of that, it reflects any negative parts back up. So the graph would have a V-shape, but now the vertex is at (0, 0) again, but it's shifted. Wait, actually, let me think more carefully.

Wait, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So, the first |x| is a V with vertex at 0. Then subtract 1/2: that would create a V that's shifted down by 1/2. But then taking the absolute value of that would reflect any part that goes negative back upward. So the graph of f(x) will have vertices where |x| -1/2 is 0, which is at x = ±1/2. So at x=1/2 and x=-1/2, f(x)=0. Then, for |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. For |x| < 1/2, f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So, the graph of f(x) is a V-shape with vertices at (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0), and (-1/2, 0). So it's a diamond shape, peaking at the center.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that. The inner |x| is the V-shape. Subtracting 1/4 shifts the graph down by 1/4. Then taking the absolute value would reflect the negative parts. So the points where |x| -1/4 =0 are at x=±1/4. So at x=1/4 and x=-1/4, g(x)=0. For |x| >=1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. For |x| <1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. So the graph of g(x) is another diamond shape, peaking at (0,1/4), with vertices at (1/4,0) and (-1/4,0).

Okay, so now I have f and g defined. Next, I need to compute 4g(f(...)) for both functions.

Starting with the first equation: \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \).

Let me break this down. Let's see:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1 because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so 2π/(2π)=1. So sin(2πx) is a sine wave that completes one full cycle as x goes from 0 to 1.

2. Then, f is applied to this sine wave: f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Let me think about the range of sin(2πx). It's between -1 and 1. So | sin(2πx) | is between 0 and 1. Then subtract 1/2, so | sin(2πx) | - 1/2 can range from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value, f(sin(2πx)) will be between 0 and 1/2.

3. Then, g is applied to that result: g(f(...)) = || f(...) | - 1/4 |. Since f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, | f(...) | is the same as f(...). So, f(...) ranges from 0 to 1/2. So, subtracting 1/4 gives a value between -1/4 and 1/4. Taking the absolute value, g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

4. Finally, multiply by 4: 4 * g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1. So, the entire expression for y is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1 as x varies.

Similarly, the second equation is \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3πy))) \).

Let me analyze that one:

1. Start with cos(3πy). The period of cos(ky) is 2π/k, so here it's 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So cos(3πy) completes a full cycle as y increases by 2/3. The range is between -1 and 1.

2. Apply f: f(cos(3πy)) = || cos(3πy) | - 1/2 |. The same logic as before applies. |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1. Subtract 1/2, so it ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking absolute value, f(cos(3πy)) is between 0 and 1/2.

3. Then, apply g: g(f(...)) = || f(...) | - 1/4 |. Since f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, subtracting 1/4 ranges from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking absolute value, g(f(...)) is between 0 and 1/4.

4. Multiply by 4: 4 * g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1. So, the entire expression for x is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1 as y varies.

So both equations y and x range between 0 and 1. Hmm, interesting.

But wait, in the first equation, y is a function of x, and in the second, x is a function of y. So the problem is to find all points (x,y) where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, it's like a system of equations where each variable is defined in terms of the other.

Wait, but both x and y are defined in terms of each other through these functions. So, to find intersections, we need to find points (x, y) where both equations are satisfied.

This seems similar to solving a system where x and y are each functions of the other. It might involve some symmetry or periodicity.

Let me consider possible approaches. One way is to analyze the nature of these functions and see how they intersect.

Alternatively, since both equations are periodic, perhaps the number of intersections can be found by analyzing over a specific interval and then multiplying by the number of periods.

But first, let's try to understand the behavior of the functions.

First, for the first equation: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's think about how y behaves as x varies.

Since sin(2πx) has a period of 1, and x is going to be between 0 and 1 because x = 4g(...) which is between 0 and 1, so x is in [0,1]. Similarly, y is between 0 and 1 because y = 4g(...), which is between 0 and 1.

So, the domain and range for both x and y are [0,1]. So, the problem is essentially looking for the number of intersections in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].

So, I can focus on x and y between 0 and 1.

Now, let's think about the functions more carefully.

First, consider the inner function for y: sin(2πx). As x goes from 0 to 1, sin(2πx) goes from 0 up to 1 at x=1/4, back to 0 at x=1/2, down to -1 at x=3/4, and back to 0 at x=1.

But since we take the absolute value in f, |sin(2πx)|, which means the function is always non-negative. So, |sin(2πx)| has peaks at x=1/4 and x=3/4, with value 1, and is 0 at x=0, 1/2, and 1.

Then, f(|sin(2πx)|) = || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. As we saw earlier, f(z) is a diamond shape with peaks at 0 and 1/2. So, when |sin(2πx)| is 1, f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 1/2, f(1/2)=0.

So, f(|sin(2πx)|) will have a shape that peaks at 1/2 when |sin(2πx)| is 0 or 1, and is 0 when |sin(2πx)| is 1/2.

Wait, so for |sin(2πx)| = 1, f(z)=1/2; for |sin(2πx)|=1/2, f(z)=0; and for |sin(2πx)| between 0 and 1/2, f(z) increases from 1/2 to 0 and back to 1/2. No, wait, let me think.

Wait, f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|. So, for z >= 0, it's |z - 1/2|. So, for z < 1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - z. For z >= 1/2, f(z) = z - 1/2.

So, when |sin(2πx)| is 0, f(z)=1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 1/2, f(z)=0. When |sin(2πx)| is 1, f(z)=1/2.

So, the f(|sin(2πx)|) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with maxima at x=0, 1/2, 1, and minima at x=1/4, 3/4.

Then, we apply g to this. So, g(f(...)) = || f(...) - 1/4 |.

Since f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, let's denote w = f(...). So, g(w) = |w - 1/4|.

So, when w >= 1/4, g(w) = w - 1/4. When w <1/4, g(w) = 1/4 -w.

So, the function g(w) is a V-shape with vertex at w=1/4, g(w)=0, and it goes up on either side.

So, when w is 0, g(w) = 1/4. When w is 1/2, g(w)=1/2 -1/4=1/4.

Wait, so when w is 0, g(w)=1/4, and when w is 1/2, g(w)=1/4. So, the graph of g(w) is a V shape with minima at w=1/4 (g(w)=0), and maxima at w=0 and w=1/2 (g(w)=1/4 each).

So, putting it all together, 4g(f(...)) is 4 times this V-shaped function. So, when w is 1/4, 4g(w)=0; when w is 0 or 1/2, 4g(w)=1.

So, the first equation, y =4g(f(sin(2πx))), is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1. Let's think about how this behaves over x from 0 to 1.

Since |sin(2πx)| is symmetric around x=1/4 and x=3/4, etc., the function f(|sin(2πx)|) will also be symmetric. Similarly, g(f(...)) will reflect these symmetries.

Similarly, the second equation is x=4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's analyze that.

First, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3. So, as y increases from 0 to 2/3, cos(3πy) completes a full cycle. But since y is between 0 and 1, we'll have one and a half periods in the interval [0,1].

But since we're taking the absolute value, |cos(3πy)|, it will reflect the negative parts to positive, effectively having a period of 1/3. Hmm, wait, no. The function |cos(ky)| has a period of π/k instead of 2π/k. So, for cos(3πy), the period is 2π/(3π)=2/3. So |cos(3πy)| has a period of (π)/(3π) = 1/3. So, in the interval y=0 to 1, |cos(3πy)| completes three cycles.

So, |cos(3πy)| is a function that goes from 1 at y=0, down to 0 at y=1/6, up to 1 at y=1/3, down to 0 at y=1/2, up to 1 at y=2/3, down to 0 at y=5/6, and back to 1 at y=1.

Then, applying f to this: f(|cos(3πy)|) = |||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. So, similar to before, when |cos(3πy)| is 1, f(z)=1/2; when it's 1/2, f(z)=0; and when it's 0, f(z) =1/2.

So, f(|cos(3πy)|) will oscillate between 0 and 1/2, with minima at y=1/6, 1/2, 5/6, and maxima at y=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1.

Then, applying g to this: g(f(...))=|f(...) -1/4|.

Again, since f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, let’s denote w = f(...). So, when w <1/4, g(w)=1/4 -w; when w >=1/4, g(w)=w -1/4.

Thus, 4g(f(...)) will be 4*(1/4 -w) when w <1/4, and 4*(w -1/4) when w >=1/4.

So, 4g(f(...)) is equal to 1 -4w when w <1/4 and 4w -1 when w >=1/4.

Now, since w = f(|cos(3πy)|), which is between 0 and 1/2, the function 4g(f(...)) will be between 0 and 1.

So, the second equation is x=4g(f(cos(3πy))), which is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1 as y varies.

Now, to find the intersections between these two graphs, we need to find all (x,y) in [0,1]x[0,1] such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Hmm, this seems quite involved. Maybe it's better to analyze the behavior of these functions over their periods and see how they might intersect.

Let me consider the first function, y = 4g(f(sin(2
