Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). The question is about finding the distance from the incenter (I think that's what they mean by the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer needs to be in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, and then find m + n + p.

Hmm, first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found if we know the volume and the surface area. I think the formula is similar to the 2D case, where the inradius is 3 times the volume divided by the surface area. So, maybe for a tetrahedron, the inradius r is 3V divided by the total surface area A.

So, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A. Then, r = 3V / A.

First, let's think about the surface area. The tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is a triangle, and since the edges are given in pairs, each face must be congruent to the opposite face. Wait, no, not necessarily congruent, but maybe each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, for example, AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD.

Wait, does that mean the tetrahedron is "isohedral"? Or maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such a tetrahedron is called "equifacial" or "isohedral" but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal.

Yes, looking it up in my mind, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces, but wait, no, a disphenoid has opposite edges equal, but the faces are congruent in pairs. So, each pair of opposite faces are congruent.

Wait, in this problem, each pair of opposite edges is equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, that makes it a disphenoid. So, all four faces are congruent triangles, each pair of opposite faces being congruent. So, each face is congruent to the one opposite. So, that would mean that the surface area is 4 times the area of one face.

Wait, but in our case, each face is a triangle, but since opposite edges are equal, but not necessarily all edges equal. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me check: For example, face ABC has edges AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD has AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), and AD = sqrt(89). So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all four faces are congruent triangles.

Wait, so each face is congruent, so the surface area is 4 times the area of one face. So, I'll need to compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.

So, first, let me compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). To find the area, I can use Heron's formula.

Heron's formula: For a triangle with sides a, b, c, the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter, (a + b + c)/2.

So, let's compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

Hmm, that looks a bit messy, but maybe we can compute it numerically or find a way to simplify.

Wait, another approach: Since all edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), maybe the triangle is right-angled? Let me check if (sqrt(41))^2 + (sqrt(80))^2 equals (sqrt(89))^2.

sqrt(41)^2 is 41, sqrt(80)^2 is 80, sum is 121. sqrt(89)^2 is 89. 121 ≠ 89. So that's not right. How about 41 + 89? 130, which is not equal to 80. Hmm. So, it's not a right-angled triangle. So, Heron's formula is needed.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates. Maybe setting up coordinates for the tetrahedron.

Wait, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal, maybe it can be embedded in a coordinate system with certain symmetries. Let me think: If I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that opposite edges are equal, maybe it's easier to compute the volume.

Yes, perhaps setting coordinates for the tetrahedron would be a good approach. Let me think about how to place the points.

In a disphenoid, the coordinates can be chosen such that the opposite edges are equal, and the midpoints of the edges are at the origin. Alternatively, maybe I can place the points in a symmetric way.

Wait, maybe I can place the points as follows:

Let me denote the coordinates as A, B, C, D.

Suppose I place A, B, C, D such that the midpoints of AC and BD are at the origin, and the midpoints of AB and CD are also at the origin. Hmm, that might complicate things, but perhaps it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe we can use vectors to represent the points such that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin.

Alternatively, perhaps using the property that in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed if we know the lengths of the edges.

Wait, I remember that for a disphenoid, the volume can be found using the formula:

V = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2d^2)]) ) / 12

Wait, not sure about that. Maybe better to think in terms of coordinates.

Alternatively, since all the opposite edges are equal, we can model the tetrahedron such that the coordinates of the points can be expressed in terms of vectors that are symmetric.

Wait, perhaps setting the centroid at the origin, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the tetrahedron as follows:

Let me consider points A, B, C, D in 3D space such that vectors OA, OB, OC, OD satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume.

Yes, Cayley-Menger determinant is a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron given the lengths of its edges. The formula is:

V = sqrt( det(CM) / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is the determinant of the following matrix:

[ 0  1    1    1    1  ]
[ 1  0  AB² AC² AD² ]
[ 1 AB²  0  BC² BD² ]
[ 1 AC² BC²  0  CD² ]
[ 1 AD² BD² CD²  0  ]

So, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix, but since the first row and column are [0,1,1,1,1], and the rest follow.

But in our case, the edge lengths are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), BC = AD = sqrt(89).

So, AB² = 41, AC² = 80, AD² = 89, BC² = 89, BD² = 80, CD² = 41.

So, plugging into the Cayley-Menger determinant:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix. The first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T. The diagonal from (1,1) to (4,4) are the squares of the edges. Wait, no, actually, the diagonal from (1,1) is (AB)^2, (2,2) is AC^2, (3,3) is AD^2, (4,4) is BC^2, but wait, no, perhaps I need to make sure.

Wait, no, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the entries CM[1][2] is AB², CM[1][3] is AC², CM[1][4] is AD², CM[2][3] is BC², CM[2][4] is BD², CM[3][4] is CD².

So, the matrix is:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, AB², AC², AD²]

Row 2: [1, AB², 0, BC², BD²]

Row 3: [1, AC², BC², 0, CD²]

Row 4: [1, AD², BD², CD², 0]

So, using the given edge lengths:

AB² = 41, AC² = 80, AD² = 89,

BC² = 89, BD² = 80, CD² =41.

So, plugging in:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. Hmm, that's a 5x5 determinant, which is a bit tedious by hand, but maybe we can find some patterns or use symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the disphenoid has certain properties that can simplify the determinant.

Wait, let me compute the determinant step by step.

First, write out the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, computing the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is quite involved. Maybe we can perform row operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps we can exploit that symmetry.

Wait, let's denote the matrix as M. The determinant is det(M).

Alternatively, maybe we can subtract rows to create zeros.

For example, subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4, 5 (but wait, in the problem, it's a 5x5 matrix, so Rows 0 to 4). So, subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4.

Wait, let me try that.

Row 2' = Row 2 - Row 1:

Row 2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9

Similarly, Row 3' = Row 3 - Row 1:

1-1=0, 80-0=80, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48

Row 4' = Row 4 - Row 1:

1-1=0, 89-0=89, 80-41=39, 41-80=-39, 0-89=-89

So, the new matrix after these row operations is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9

Row 3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48

Row 4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89

Now, the determinant remains the same, because we performed row subtraction (which doesn't change the determinant). Now, let's expand the determinant along the first column, which has four zeros and a 1.

The determinant is equal to the element at (1,1) times the minor of that element, which is a 4x4 determinant.

But wait, no. The first column is [0,1,0,0,0]^T. So, when expanding along the first column, only the element at Row 1, Column 1 is 1, and the rest are 0. So, the determinant is equal to (-1)^(1+1) * 1 * det(minor at Row1, Column1).

The minor is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing Row 1 and Column 1:

Row 0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 2: 41, -41, 9, -9

Row 3: 80, 48, -80, -48

Row 4: 89, 39, -39, -89

So, the minor matrix is:

[1, 1, 1, 1]

[41, -41, 9, -9]

[80, 48, -80, -48]

[89, 39, -39, -89]

Now, we need to compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.

Hmm, 4x4 determinant is still a bit lengthy, but maybe we can perform more row operations to simplify.

Looking at the first row: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Maybe we can subtract the first row from the others to create zeros.

Let's do that.

Row 2' = Row 2 - 41*Row 1: Wait, but 41 is the first element of Row 2. Alternatively, perhaps subtracting Row 1 multiplied by 1 from Row 2, 3, 4.

Wait, perhaps subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4.

Row 2' = Row2 - Row1: [41-1=40, -41-1=-42, 9-1=8, -9-1=-10]

Row 3' = Row3 - Row1: [80-1=79, 48-1=47, -80-1=-81, -48-1=-49]

Row 4' = Row4 - Row1: [89-1=88, 39-1=38, -39-1=-40, -89-1=-90]

Wait, no. Wait, if I subtract Row 1 from Row 2, 3, 4, the first element of Row 2 is 41, so Row2 - 41*Row1 would zero out the first element.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach. Let's try that.

Compute Row2' = Row2 - 41*Row1.

Row2: [41, -41, 9, -9]

Row1: [1, 1, 1, 1]

So, 41*Row1: [41, 41, 41, 41]

Row2' = Row2 - 41*Row1: [41-41=0, -41-41=-82, 9-41=-32, -9-41=-50]

Similarly, Row3' = Row3 - 80*Row1.

Row3: [80, 48, -80, -48]

80*Row1: [80, 80, 80, 80]

Row3' = Row3 -80*Row1: [80-80=0, 48-80=-32, -80-80=-160, -48-80=-128]

Row4' = Row4 -89*Row1.

Row4: [89, 39, -39, -89]

89*Row1: [89,89,89,89]

Row4' = Row4 -89*Row1: [89-89=0, 39-89=-50, -39-89=-128, -89-89=-178]

So, the new matrix after these operations is:

Row 0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 2': [0, -82, -32, -50]

Row 3': [0, -32, -160, -128]

Row 4': [0, -50, -128, -178]

Now, the determinant of the minor is the same as the determinant of this new 4x4 matrix.

Now, let's expand this determinant along the first column, which now has 1 followed by three zeros. So, the determinant is equal to (-1)^(0+0) * 1 * det(minor at Row0, Column0).

The minor is the 3x3 matrix:

[ -82, -32, -50 ]

[ -32, -160, -128 ]

[ -50, -128, -178 ]

So, the determinant we need is det of this 3x3 matrix.

Let's compute that.

The determinant of:

| -82   -32    -50 |

| -32  -160   -128 |

| -50  -128  -178 |

We can compute this using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.

Let me use cofactor expansion along the first row.

= -82 * det( [ -160, -128 ], [ -128, -178 ] ) 
- (-32) * det( [ -32, -128 ], [ -50, -178 ] )
+ (-50) * det( [ -32, -160 ], [ -50, -128 ] )

Compute each minor:

First minor: det( [ -160, -128 ], [ -128, -178 ] )

= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128)
= (160*178) - (128*128)
Compute 160*178: 160*(180-2) = 160*180=28,800 - 160*2=320 → 28,800 - 320 = 28,480
Compute 128*128=16,384
So, first minor = 28,480 - 16,384 = 12,096

Second minor: det( [ -32, -128 ], [ -50, -178 ] )

= (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50)
= (32*178) - (128*50)
32*178: 32*(170 + 8) = 32*170=5,440 + 32*8=256 → 5,696
128*50=6,400
So, second minor=5,696 - 6,400= -704

Third minor: det( [ -32, -160 ], [ -50, -128 ] )

= (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50)
= 4,096 - 8,000
= -3,904

Now, putting it all together:

Determinant = (-82)*12,096 - (-32)*(-704) + (-50)*(-3,904)

Compute each term:

First term: (-82)*12,096
= -82 * 12,096
Compute 80*12,096= 967,680
2*12,096=24,192
Total: 967,680 +24,192=991,872
So, first term: -991,872

Second term: -(-32)*(-704) = -32*704
32*700=22,400
32*4=128 → 22,400+128=22,528
So, second term: -22,528

Third term: (-50)*(-3,904) = 50*3,904 = 195,200

Now, sum all terms:

-991,872 -22,528 +195,200

= (-991,872 -22,528) +195,200

= (-1,014,400) +195,200

= -819,200

So, the determinant of the 3x3 minor is -819,200.

But remember, the determinant of the 4x4 minor was equal to that, and the determinant of the 5x5 matrix was equal to 1 times that, so det(M) = -819,200.

Wait, no, let me retrace:

Wait, in the 5x5 determinant, we had:

det(M) = 1 * det(4x4 minor)

Then, the 4x4 minor was transformed by row operations, and its determinant turned out to be -819,200.

But wait, actually, in the first step, we subtracted Row1 from Rows2,3,4, which didn't change the determinant, then we expanded along the first column, which gave us 1 * det(4x4 minor). Then, we transformed the 4x4 minor into a new matrix via row operations, and found the determinant of that to be -819,200. So, the 4x4 determinant is -819,200, which makes the 5x5 determinant also -819,200.

But wait, I thought the determinant was 1 * det(4x4 minor), which was -819,200. So, det(M) = -819,200.

But the volume V is sqrt( |det(M)| / 288 ). Since volume can't be negative, we take the absolute value.

So, |det(M)| is 819,200. Then, V = sqrt(819200 / 288 )

Simplify 819200 / 288:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 819200 /16=51,200; 288/16=18.

So, 51,200 / 18 = (51,200 ÷ 2) / (18 ÷2 )=25,600 /9.

So, V = sqrt(25,600 /9 ) = sqrt(25,600)/sqrt(9)= 160 /3.

So, the volume V is 160/3.

Wait, that seems manageable.

So, V = 160/3.

Now, moving on to compute the surface area.

Each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Since all four faces are congruent, the surface area A is 4 times the area of one face.

So, let's compute the area of one face. Let's use Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps we can compute s^2, or maybe find a way to express the area differently.

Alternatively, since we have the edges, perhaps using the formula for area in terms of vectors or coordinates, but that might be complicated.

Wait, another approach: Since we know the volume and the inradius, but wait, we need the inradius, which is 3V / A. But we don't have the inradius yet, but maybe we can compute the area another way.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area using Heron's formula with the given edge lengths.

Let me denote a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).

s = (a + b + c)/2.

Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

But this will involve a lot of square roots. Maybe instead, we can compute s^2 and s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) in terms of squares.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinates for the triangle.

Wait, but we can also note that the area of each face can be computed using the formula:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

Which is another version of Heron's formula.

So, let's compute that.

Let me compute (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c).

Compute each term:

First term: a + b + c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89).

Second term: -a + b + c = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89).

Third term: a - b + c = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89).

Fourth term: a + b - c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89).

Multiplying all four terms together would be complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to compute it.

Alternatively, note that (a + b + c)(-a + b + c) = (b + c)^2 - a^2.

Similarly, (a - b + c)(a + b - c) = a^2 - (b - c)^2.

So, let's compute each pair:

First, (a + b + c)(-a + b + c) = (b + c)^2 - a^2 = (sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))^2 - (sqrt(41))^2.

Similarly, (a - b + c)(a + b - c) = a^2 - (b - c)^2.

Let me compute each of these.

Compute (sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))^2:

= (sqrt(80))^2 + 2*sqrt(80)*sqrt(89) + (sqrt(89))^2
= 80 + 2*sqrt(80*89) + 89
= 80 + 89 + 2*sqrt(7120)
= 169 + 2*sqrt(7120)

Similarly, a^2 = (sqrt(41))^2 = 41.

So, (b + c)^2 - a^2 = 169 + 2*sqrt(7120) - 41 = 128 + 2*sqrt(7120).

Similarly, compute (a - b + c)(a + b - c) = a^2 - (b - c)^2.

Compute (b - c)^2 = (sqrt(80) - sqrt(89))^2 = 80 + 89 - 2*sqrt(80*89) = 169 - 2*sqrt(7120).

So, a^2 - (b - c)^2 = 41 - [169 - 2*sqrt(7120)] = 41 - 169 + 2*sqrt(7120) = -128 + 2*sqrt(7120).

Now, multiply the two results:

[128 + 2*sqrt(7120)] * [ -128 + 2*sqrt(7120) ]

Let me compute this as (x + y)(-x + y) = y^2 - x^2, where x=128, y=2*sqrt(7120).

So, it's (2*sqrt(7120))^2 - (128)^2.

Compute (2*sqrt(7120))^2 = 4 *7120 = 28,480.

(128)^2=16,384.

So, the product is 28,480 - 16,384 = 12,096.

Therefore, the product of the four terms is 12,096.

Therefore, Area = (1/4)*sqrt(12,096).

Compute sqrt(12,096):

Let's factor 12,096.

12,096 ÷ 16=756.

756 ÷ 4=189.

189=9*21=9*3*7.

So, 12,096=16*4*9*3*7= 16*4*9*21.

Wait, but sqrt(12,096)=sqrt(16 * 756)=4*sqrt(756).

756=36*21, so sqrt(756)=6*sqrt(21).

So, sqrt(12,096)=4*6*sqrt(21)=24*sqrt(21).

Therefore, Area = (1/4)*24*sqrt(21)=6*sqrt(21).

So, each face has area 6*sqrt(21). Therefore, the total surface area A = 4*6*sqrt(21)=24*sqrt(21).

So, A =24*sqrt(21).

Now, going back to the formula for the inradius r = 3V / A.

We have V=160/3, A=24*sqrt(21).

So, r = 3*(160/3) / (24*sqrt(21)) = (160) / (24*sqrt(21)).

Simplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.

So, r = (20/3) / sqrt(21) = (20)/(3*sqrt(21)).

Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):

r = (20*sqrt(21)) / (3*21) )= (20*sqrt(21))/63.

Simplify 20 and 63: they have no common factors, so it's 20/sqrt(21) rationalized.

So, r = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.

But the problem states that the distance can be written as m*sqrt(n)/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.

In our case, m=20, n=21, p=63. Are m and p coprime?

20 and 63: factors of 20 are 2,5; factors of 63 are 3,7. No common factors, so yes, they are coprime.

Is n=21 square-free? 21 factors into 3*7, both primes, so yes.

So, the distance is (20 sqrt(21))/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63.

Therefore, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63=104.

Wait, but wait, before finalizing, let me double-check the calculations, because 104 seems a bit high.

Wait, let's verify the steps.

First, the Cayley-Menger determinant: when I computed the determinant of the minor, I got -819,200. Then, V = sqrt( |det(M)| /288 ) = sqrt(819200 /288 )=sqrt(2866.666…). Wait, but 819200 /288: let's compute that again.

Compute 819200 ÷ 288.

Well, 288 = 16 * 18.

819200 ÷ 16=51,200.

51,200 ÷18= approx 2,844.444..., but exact fraction is 51,200 /18=25,600 /9.

So, V= sqrt(25,600 /9 ) = 160/3, which is correct.

Then, surface area: each face is 6*sqrt(21), so 4* that is 24*sqrt(21). Correct.

r=3V/A=3*(160/3)/(24 sqrt(21))=160/(24 sqrt(21))= (20)/(3 sqrt(21))= (20 sqrt(21))/63.

Yes, so that's correct.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20 +21 +63=104.

But just to make sure, let me re-examine the Heron's formula part, because that's where things often go wrong.

We had a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). We computed the product for Heron's formula as 12,096, so the area is (1/4)*sqrt(12,096)=6*sqrt(21). Let's confirm:

sqrt(12,096)= sqrt(16*756)=4*sqrt(756). sqrt(756)=sqrt(36*21)=6*sqrt(21). So, 4*6*sqrt(21)=24*sqrt(21). Then, (1/4)*24*sqrt(21)=6*sqrt(21). Correct.

So, all steps seem correct. So, the answer is 104.


To solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron \(ABCD\) is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal: \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\). The goal is to find the distance from the incenter \(I\) to each face, which is the inradius \(r\).

### Step 1: Compute the Volume \(V\) using the Cayley-Menger Determinant
The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \(AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD\) is given by:
\[
V = \frac{\sqrt{|\text{det}(CM)|}}{288}
\]
The Cayley-Menger matrix \(CM\) is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
After performing row operations and simplifying, the determinant of the minor matrix is found to be \(-819200\). Thus,
\[
V = \frac{\sqrt{819200}}{288} = \frac{160}{3}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the Surface Area \(A\)
Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is calculated as:
\[
\text{Area} = 6\sqrt{21}
\]
Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area is:
\[
A = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Inradius \(r\)
The inradius \(r\) is given by:
\[
r = \frac{3V}{A} = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]
Thus, the distance is in the form \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\), where \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

**Answer:** \(\boxed{104}\)
