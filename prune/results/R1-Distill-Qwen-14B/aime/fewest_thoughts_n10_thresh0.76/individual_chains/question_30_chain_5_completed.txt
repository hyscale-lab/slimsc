Okay, so I’ve got this math problem here. It says, let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First off, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because ω ≠ 1. That means ω satisfies ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. These roots are important in complex analysis and algebra, often used in problems involving cyclotomic polynomials or roots of unity.

The expression I need to compute is the product of terms (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for each k from 0 to 12. Wait, but ω^0 is 1, right? So when k=0, the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. Okay, maybe I can ignore that term since multiplying by 1 doesn’t change the product. So the product essentially starts from k=1 to 12.

So, I'm looking at the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, how can I simplify each term? Let me consider the term inside the product:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me set z = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So, 2 - 2z + z². Let me rearrange that: z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, can this quadratic be factored?

Wait, z² - 2z + 2. Let's calculate the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are complex. Hmm, maybe not useful for factoring over real numbers, but perhaps over complex numbers? Or maybe I can relate this to other roots of unity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as (z - a)(z - b), but since the discriminant is negative, it would involve complex factors.

Wait, but perhaps instead of trying to factor, I can relate this quadratic to some cyclotomic polynomial or another known polynomial involving ω.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the quadratic as something else. Let me see:

z² - 2z + 2. Let me write it as z² - 2z + 1 + 1, which is (z - 1)^2 + 1. So, (z - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, that might not help directly, but perhaps I can think of it as a magnitude squared or something.

Wait, is there a connection to roots of unity? Let's see: since z is a 13th root of unity, so z^13 = 1.

Wait, but z = ω^k, so z^13 = 1. So perhaps I can write the quadratic in terms of z and use properties of roots of unity.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the product over all k from 1 to 12 of (2 - 2z + z²) where z^13 = 1 and z ≠ 1.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can consider evaluating the product by treating it as a product over all non-trivial 13th roots of unity of some function.

Wait, in general, if I have a polynomial f(x), the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is the minimal polynomial for ω, which is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. But in this case, instead of (x - ω^k), I have (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to evaluating a polynomial at a certain value.

Let me think: if I have a product over k of (a - b ω^k + c ω^{2k}), maybe that's related to evaluating a polynomial with roots at ω^k?

Wait, let me try to see if 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten in a more manageable form. Let me factor out something. Let me see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2 = 0, but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor it as (ω^{k} - something)(ω^{k} - something else). Let me try:

Suppose ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2 = (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b). Then, expanding, we get ω^{2k} - (a + b)ω^k + ab. Comparing coefficients, we have:

a + b = 2,

ab = 2.

So, we need two numbers a and b such that a + b = 2 and ab = 2. The solutions to this would be the roots of x² - 2x + 2 = 0, which are 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, that means 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Interesting!

Therefore, the term we are multiplying becomes (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the entire product from k=1 to 12 is the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Hmm, so if I can compute the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - a) for a given a, then I can compute each part separately.

Wait, but I know that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to Φ_13(x), the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But in this case, we have a product over (ω^k - a) for a specific a. So, let's see. Let me consider the product over all k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) = Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But if I set x = a, then the product over (a - ω^k) from k=1 to 12 is Φ_13(a) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1.

Wait, but in our case, we have (ω^k - a) = -(a - ω^k). So, the product over (ω^k - a) would be (-1)^{12} times the product over (a - ω^k). Since 12 is even, (-1)^12 = 1. So, the product over (ω^k - a) from k=1 to 12 is equal to Φ_13(a).

Therefore, the product over (ω^k - a) from k=1 to 12 is Φ_13(a) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1.

So, going back to our problem, the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i)) is Φ_13(1 + i), and similarly, the product over (ω^k - (1 - i)) is Φ_13(1 - i).

Therefore, the entire product is Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i).

So, now, I need to compute Φ_13(1 + i) and Φ_13(1 - i), multiply them together, and that gives me the value of the original product.

But what is Φ_13(x)? It's the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

So, Φ_13(1 + i) is (1 + i)^12 + (1 + i)^11 + ... + (1 + i) + 1.

Similarly, Φ_13(1 - i) is (1 - i)^12 + (1 - i)^11 + ... + (1 - i) + 1.

Wait, but computing that sum directly seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, another approach: since Φ_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1), so Φ_13(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1) provided that a ≠ 1. So, in our case, a is (1 + i) and (1 - i), which are not equal to 1, so that's fine.

So, Φ_13(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/(1 + i - 1) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/(i).

Similarly, Φ_13(1 - i) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i).

So, maybe I can compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

Hmm, okay, let's compute (1 + i)^13.

First, note that 1 + i is a complex number. Let me write it in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is π/4 radians.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Let me compute these.

First, (sqrt(2))^13 is (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, e^{i * 13π/4}: 13π/4 is the same as 3π/4 after subtracting 2π (since 13π/4 - 3π = 13π/4 - 12π/4 = π/4). Wait, no, 13π/4 is π/4 more than 3π, which is 3π + π/4. Let me think: 13π/4 is 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to π/4 in the negative direction because angles are periodic modulo 2π.

Wait, 13π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8, so subtract 2π (which is 8π/4) to get 5π/4. No, wait:

Wait, 13π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8, which is 1 and 5/8, so we can subtract 2π once, which is 8π/4, so 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

So, e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i * 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, e^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{-i * 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, let me check that:

5π/4 is in the third quadrant. Cosine is -sqrt(2)/2, sine is -sqrt(2)/2. So, e^{i5π/4} is (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2). Similarly, e^{-i5π/4} is (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).

So, putting it together:

(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Multiply that out:

Let me compute 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2):

sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * 2 * (-i / 2) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13:

(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Compute the real part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, as before.

Imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (i / 2) ) = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.

Now, going back to Φ_13(1 + i) and Φ_13(1 - i):

Φ_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i) = [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] / i = (-65 - 64i)/i.

Similarly, Φ_13(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) = [ (-64 + 64i) - 1 ] / (-i) = (-65 + 64i)/(-i).

Let me compute each of these fractions.

First, let's compute (-65 - 64i)/i.

To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by i:

[ (-65 - 64i) * i ] / (i * i) = [ -65i -64i^2 ] / (-1) = [ -65i +64 ] / (-1) = (-64 + 65i)/1 = -64 + 65i.

Wait, wait:

Wait, let me re-calculate:

(-65 -64i)/i = multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65 -64i)*i = (-65)*i + (-64i)*i = -65i -64i².

But i² = -1, so it's -65i -64*(-1) = -65i +64.

Denominator: i*i = i² = -1.

So, the entire expression is (-65i +64)/(-1) = (64 -65i)/(-1) = -64 +65i.

Wait, no: (64 -65i)/(-1) = -64 +65i.

Wait, let me recheck:

[ (-65 -64i) / i ]: multiplying numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65)(i) + (-64i)(i) = -65i -64i² = -65i +64.

Denominator: i² = -1.

So, numerator is 64 -65i, denominator is -1. So, (64 -65i)/(-1) = (-64 +65i).

So, Φ_13(1 + i) = -64 +65i.

Similarly, Φ_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).

Again, multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65 +64i)*i = (-65)*i +64i*i = -65i +64i² = -65i -64.

Denominator: (-i)*i = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So, the expression is (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.

So, Φ_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

Therefore, the product Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i) is (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i).

This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which equals the square of the modulus.

So, modulus squared: |(-64 +65i)|² = (-64)^2 + (65)^2.

Calculate that:

64² = 4096,

65² = 4225,

So, sum is 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Therefore, the product is 8321.

Wait, hold on, so the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is equal to 8321.

But wait, remember that earlier, I had excluded the k=0 term, which was 1, so including it, the total product is 8321 * 1 = 8321.

But the problem states that ω ≠ 1 is a 13th root of unity, and the product is from k=0 to 12. So, including k=0, which gives 1, the entire product is 8321.

Wait, but wait a second, earlier I thought that Φ_13(x) is the product from k=1 to 12, so when I multiplied Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i), that was the product from k=1 to 12. So, including k=0, which is 1, the total product is 8321 * 1 = 8321.

But wait, I should double-check that. Because when I expressed the product as Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i), that was the product from k=1 to 12, so the entire product from k=0 to 12 would be 8321 * 1 = 8321.

But let me verify whether my steps are correct.

1. Recognized that each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

2. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

3. When k=0, ω^0 = 1, so (1 - (1 + i)) (1 - (1 - i)) = (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = 1. So that term is 1, as before.

4. For k=1 to 12, each term is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)), so the product is Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i) = 8321.

So, yes, the total product is 8321.

Wait, but 8321? Let me check the calculation again because 64² is 4096, 65² is 4225, and 4096 + 4225 = 8321. So that part is correct.

Wait, but 8321 is a four-digit number. The problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, is that right? 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321. So yes, the remainder is 321.

But wait a minute, let me think again: in the problem statement, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes 13 terms. Earlier, I thought that the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321, but I might have made a mistake in that.

Wait, no, because when I calculated Φ_13(1 + i) and Φ_13(1 - i), each was a complex number, and their product was 8321. But wait, that product is the product from k=1 to 12, so including k=0, which contributes 1, the total product is 8321 * 1 = 8321.

So yes, the total product is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but I should double-check the initial steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the cyclotomic polynomial approach.

Wait, let's retrace:

We had Φ_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

Then, for a ≠ 1, Φ_13(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1).

So, for a = 1 + i, Φ_13(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/(1 + i - 1) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/i.

Similarly, for a = 1 - i, Φ_13(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/(1 - i - 1) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/(-i).

We then computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 correctly as -64 -64i and -64 +64i, respectively.

Then, Φ_13(1 + i) = [(-64 -64i) - 1]/i = (-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i)/i * (i/i) = (-65i -64i²)/(-1) = (-65i +64)/(-1) = 64 -65i.

Wait, wait a second, in my initial calculation, I got Φ_13(1 + i) as -64 +65i, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, wait: let's recalculate Φ_13(1 + i).

Φ_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / (i).

(1 + i)^13 = (-64 -64i).

So, [ (-64 -64i) - 1 ] = -65 -64i.

Now, divide by i: (-65 -64i)/i.

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65 -64i)*i = (-65i -64i²) = (-65i +64).

Denominator: i * i = i² = -1.

So, (-65i +64)/(-1) = 64 -65i.

Wait, that's different from my earlier result. Hmm, earlier I thought it was -64 +65i, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute this step by step:

(-65 -64i)/i.

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65 -64i)*i = (-65)*i + (-64i)*i = -65i -64i².

i² is -1, so this becomes -65i -64*(-1) = -65i +64.

Denominator: i*i = -1.

So, the result is (-65i +64)/-1 = (-64 +65i).

Wait, that's different from earlier. So, actually, Φ_13(1 + i) = (-64 +65i).

Similarly, let's compute Φ_13(1 - i):

Φ_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / (-i).

(1 - i)^13 = (-64 +64i).

So, [ (-64 +64i) - 1 ] = -65 +64i.

Divide by (-i): (-65 +64i)/(-i).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65 +64i)*i = (-65i +64i²) = (-65i -64).

Denominator: (-i)*i = -i² = 1.

So, the result is (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.

So, Φ_13(1 + i) = (-64 +65i), Φ_13(1 - i) = (-64 -65i).

Now, multiply these two:

(-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225 * i²).

But i² = -1, so it's 4096 - (4225*(-1)) = 4096 +4225 = 8321.

So, that part is correct. So, the product from k=1 to12 is 8321, and the total product including k=0 is 8321*1=8321.

So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, remainder 321.

Wait, but let me check the calculation of (1 + i)^13 again because that's a critical step.

(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i.

(1 + i)^2 = (1 + i)(1 + i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.

(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.

(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.

(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^(8 + 4 + 1) = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i).

Which is 16 * (-4) * (1 + i) = 16*(-4) = -64, multiplied by (1 + i) is -64*(1 + i) = -64 -64i.

Wait, that's correct. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate, so it's -64 +64i. Wait, no: wait, (1 - i)^1 = 1 - i.

(1 - i)^2 = (1 - i)(1 - i) = 1 - 2i + i² = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i.

(1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4.

(1 - i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.

(1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^8 * (1 - i)^4 * (1 - i) = 16 * (-4) * (1 - i) = (-64) * (1 - i) = -64 +64i.

So, yes, correct.

So, Φ_13(1 + i) = [(-64 -64i) -1]/i = (-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i)/i * (i/i) = (-65i -64i²)/(-1) = (-65i +64)/(-1) = 64 -65i.

Wait, earlier I had Φ_13(1 + i) as -64 +65i, but that seems incorrect. Wait, let me re-calculate this step carefully.

Φ_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / (1 + i - 1) = [ (-64 -64i) - 1 ] / i = (-65 -64i)/i.

Now, to compute (-65 -64i)/i, let's multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65 -64i)*i = (-65)*i + (-64i)*i = -65i -64i².

Since i² = -1, this becomes -65i -64*(-1) = -65i +64.

Denominator: i * i = i² = -1.

So, [ (-65i +64) ] / (-1) = (-65i +64)/(-1) = 65i -64.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, Φ_13(1 + i) = 65i -64.

Similarly, Φ_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / (1 - i - 1) = [ (-64 +64i) - 1 ] / (-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65 +64i)*i = (-65i +64i²) = (-65i -64).

Denominator: (-i)*i = -i² = 1.

So, the result is (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.

So, Φ_13(1 + i) = 65i -64, Φ_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

Wait, but when we multiply these two, we get:

(65i -64)*(-64 -65i).

Let me compute that:

= (65i)*(-64) + (65i)*(-65i) + (-64)*(-64) + (-64)*(-65i).

= (-4160i) + (-4225i²) + 4096 + 4160i.

Simplify each term:

-4160i -4225i² + 4096 +4160i.

Combine like terms:

The i terms: (-4160i +4160i) = 0.

The i² term: -4225i² = -4225*(-1) = +4225.

So, total is 0 + 4225 +4096 = 8321.

So, that's correct. So, the product is 8321.

Therefore, the total product from k=0 to 12 is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but earlier I thought Φ_13(1 + i) was -64 +65i, but now I'm getting 65i -64, which is the same as -64 +65i. Oh, right, because 65i -64 is the same as -64 +65i. So, my initial calculation was correct.

So, Φ_13(1 + i) = -64 +65i, Φ_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

Their product is (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 +4225 = 8321.

So, yes, that's correct.

Thus, the answer is 8321 mod 1000, which is 321.

I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the steps now.


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1 and ω ≠ 1. The given product is:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

First, notice that when k=0, the term is 1, so the product simplifies to:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

We rewrite each term using z = ω^k:

\[
2 - 2z + z^2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))
\]

Thus, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i))
\]

This can be expressed using the 13th cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x), which is:

\[
Φ_{13}(x) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1
\]

Evaluating Φ₁₃ at x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, we find:

\[
Φ_{13}(1 + i) = \frac{(1 + i)^{13} - 1}{i}, \quad Φ_{13}(1 - i) = \frac{(1 - i)^{13} - 1}{-i}
\]

Calculating (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 using polar form, we find:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i, \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i
\]

Substituting these into Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i):

\[
Φ_{13}(1 + i) = -64 + 65i, \quad Φ_{13}(1 - i) = -64 - 65i
\]

Multiplying these results:

\[
(-64 + 65i)(-64 - 65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321
\]

Thus, the product is 8321. To find the remainder when divided by 1000:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

The final answer is:

\boxed{321}
