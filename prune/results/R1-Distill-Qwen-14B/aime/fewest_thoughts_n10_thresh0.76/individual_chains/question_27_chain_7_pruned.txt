Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize and break it down step by step. 

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle. The distance from the center of the circle to this axis is 6. So, it's like taking a donut where the circular part has radius 3 and the distance from the center to the axis is 6. 

I remember that a torus can be described using two main radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, the major radius R would be 6, and the minor radius r is 3.

Now, the problem mentions a sphere S with radius 11. When the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to figure out the radii of these tangent circles for the internal and external cases. Let me think about what internal and external tangency mean here.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it touches the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it touches along another circle. The radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, are what we're looking for.

I think the key here is to find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus when they are tangent. But wait, the torus isn't a solid object; it's a surface. So, the point of tangency is along a circle, which lies on both the sphere and the torus.

Let me recall that the sphere S has radius 11, and the torus T has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

Let me consider the internal tangency first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center and the torus's center must be aligned in such a way that the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is exactly at the sphere's surface.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me imagine the sphere centered at the origin, (0,0,0), and the torus also centered at the origin. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, which is at a distance 6 from the center of the generating circle. So, the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0) in cylindrical coordinates, right? Or wait, in the case of a torus, the major radius is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus. So, if the generating circle has radius 3 and is centered at (6,0,0), then the torus is centered at the origin.

Wait, no,
