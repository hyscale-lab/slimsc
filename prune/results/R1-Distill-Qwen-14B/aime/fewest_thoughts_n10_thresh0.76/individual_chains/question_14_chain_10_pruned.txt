Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Alright, so N is a four-digit number, the largest possible, such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Interesting.

First, let me break this down. N is a four-digit number, so it's in the range from 1000 to 9999. I'm looking for the largest such N that satisfies this digit-changing property.

The key here is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, replacing that digit with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

Let me think about the structure of N. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A being the thousands digit, B the hundreds, C the tens, and D the units.

So, changing each digit to 1 one by one:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. That gives us four conditions that N must satisfy.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, we can start from 9999 and check downwards, but that might take too long. There must be a smarter way.

Let me consider each condition individually.

First, let's consider the last condition: changing the units digit D to 1, so ABC1 is divisible by 7. So, ABC1 mod 7 = 0.

Similarly, when we change the tens digit C to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.

Similarly for the other digits.

Hmm. Maybe I can model each of these conditions as equations.

Let me represent N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change A to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C +1.

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these four cases, the expression is a multiple of 7.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, the four modified numbers are:

1. N_A = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
2. N_B = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
3. N_C = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
4. N_D = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1

Each N_A, N_B, N_C, N_D must be divisible by 7.

So, N_A ≡ 0 mod 7,
N_B ≡ 0 mod 7,
N_C ≡ 0 mod 7,
N_D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm. Let me write each of these congruences.

Starting with N_A: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, N_B: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

N_C: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

N_D: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Wait, perhaps I can express each in terms of N.

Let me see:

N_A = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A - 100B - 10C - D + 100B + 10C + D) ??? Wait, that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, N_A = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let me think in terms of N.

Wait, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N_A = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

Similarly, N_B = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = (N - 100B) + 100.

N_C = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D = (N - 10C) + 10.

N_D = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = (N - D) + 1.

So, each modified number can be expressed as:

N_A = (N - 1000A) + 1000
N_B = (N - 100B) + 100
N_C = (N - 10C) + 10
N_D = (N - D) + 1

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each condition as a linear equation modulo 7.

Let me compute each modified number modulo 7.

First, N_A: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D mod 7.

Similarly, N_B: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D mod7.

And so on.

But perhaps instead of dealing with each number, I can find the original number N modulo7 in terms of each condition.

Wait, let me think.

Since each modified number is a multiple of 7, their modulo 7 is 0.

Let me compute each modified number modulo7.

First, let me compute 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7.

Compute 10^k mod7:

10^0 mod7=1

10^1 mod7=3 (since 10-7=3)

10^2 mod7=2 (since 3*10=30, 30 mod7=2)

10^3 mod7=6 (since 2*10=20, 20 mod7=6)

10^4 mod7=4 (since 6*10=60, 60 mod7=4)

Wait, 10^3 is 1000, so 1000 mod7=6.

Similarly,

1000 mod7=6,

100 mod7=2,

10 mod7=3,

1 mod7=1.

So, for N_A =1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Compute N_A mod7:

1000 mod7=6,

100B mod7=2B,

10C mod7=3C,

D mod7=D.

So, N_A mod7=6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N_B=1000A + 100 +10C + D.

Compute mod7:

1000A mod7=6A,

100 mod7=2,

10C mod7=3C,

D mod7=D.

So, N_B mod7=6A + 2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N_C=1000A + 100B +10 + D.

Mod7:

1000A mod7=6A,

100B mod7=2B,

10 mod7=3,

D mod7=D.

So, N_C mod7=6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Finally, N_D=1000A +100B +10C +1.

Mod7:

1000A mod7=6A,

100B mod7=2B,

10C mod7=3C,

1 mod7=1.

So, N_D mod7=6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, to summarize, the four congruences are:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. 6A + 2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. 6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, four equations with variables A, B, C, D.

But wait, A, B, C, D are digits, so A is from 1 to9, B, C, D from0 to9.

We need to find the largest four-digit number N=ABCD such that these four congruences are satisfied.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but maybe we can find relationships between these equations.

Let me write down the four equations:

Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. → 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7 (since 6 ≡ -1 mod7, so 6 + ... ≡0 → ... ≡1 mod7)

Equation 2:6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7. →6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7 (since 2 ≡2, 6A +2 + ... ≡0 → 6A + ... ≡5 mod7)

Equation3:6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7. →6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7 (3 ≡3, so 6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 → 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7)

Equation4:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7. →6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 (since 1 ≡1, so 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7)

So, now I have four equations:

1. 2B +3C +D ≡1 mod7.

2. 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

3. 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

4. 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Hmm. Let me see if I can express variables in terms of others.

Looking at equation4: 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Let me denote equation4 as E4.

E4:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, equation3:6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7. Let's call this E3.

E3:6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

If I subtract E3 from E4, I get:

(6A +2B +3C) - (6A +2B + D) ≡6 -4 mod7.

Simplify:

3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡2 mod7. Let's call this equation5.

Equation5:3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, equation1:2B +3C +D ≡1 mod7. E1.

From equation5, we have D ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, substitute D into E1:

2B +3C + (3C -2) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

2B +6C -2 ≡1 mod7.

Which is 2B +6C ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and7 are coprime, multiplication by inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7).

Multiply both sides by4:

(2B *4) + (6C *4) ≡3*4 mod7.

Which gives:

8B +24C ≡12 mod7.

Simplify:

8B mod7=1B,

24C mod7=3C (since 24/7=3*7=21, 24-21=3),

12 mod7=5.

So, equation becomes:

B +3C ≡5 mod7. Let's call this equation6.

Equation6:B +3C ≡5 mod7.

Now, let's look at equation2:6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7. E2.

Again, from equation5, D ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, substituting into E2:

6A +3C + (3C -2) ≡5 mod7.

Simplify:

6A +6C -2 ≡5 mod7.

Which is 6A +6C ≡7 mod7.

But 7 mod7 is 0, so:

6A +6C ≡0 mod7.

Factor out 6:

6(A + C) ≡0 mod7.

Since 6 and7 are coprime, this implies:

A + C ≡0 mod7.

So, A + C is a multiple of7.

Equation7: A + C ≡0 mod7.

Since A is a digit from1-9 and C is from0-9, A + C can be 7 or14, as 21 is too big (max A=9, C=9, 18). So, possible A + C=7 or14.

So, either A + C=7 or14.

Alright, so let's note that.

So, equation7: A + C=7 or14.

Now, let's look at equation3:E3:6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

Again, from equation5, D=3C -2 mod7.

So, substituting into E3:

6A +2B + (3C -2) ≡4 mod7.

Which is 6A +2B +3C -2 ≡4 mod7.

Thus, 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

But wait, this is exactly equation4, which was 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

So, that's consistent.

So, now, let's see what else we can do.

We have equation6: B +3C ≡5 mod7.

Equation7: A + C=7 or14.

Also, from equation5: D=3C -2 mod7.

But since D is a digit (0-9), D must be equal to (3C -2) mod7, but also, D must be between0 and9.

So, D = (3C -2) +7k, where k is an integer such that D is in 0-9.

Similarly, since 3C -2 can be negative, let's see.

But C is a digit from0-9, so 3C can be 0,3,6,...,27.

Thus, 3C -2 ranges from -2 to25.

So, D must be in 0-9, so 3C -2 +7k must be in 0-9.

So, for each C, we can compute D as (3C -2) mod7, then if the result is negative, we can add 7 to get it into 0-6, but D is a digit, so perhaps D could be 0-9, so if (3C -2) mod7 is, say, 5, then D could be5 or12, but 12 is invalid. So, D must be equal to (3C -2) mod7, but if that is negative, we have to adjust.

Wait, perhaps a better way: D ≡3C -2 mod7, so D = (3C -2) +7m, where m is an integer such that D is between0 and9.

But let's not get bogged down here yet.

Let me try to summarize:

We have:

1. A + C ≡0 mod7 → A + C=7 or14.

2. B +3C ≡5 mod7.

3. D ≡3C -2 mod7.

Our variables are A, B, C, D, with A (1-9), B,C,D (0-9).

We need to find the maximum N=ABCD, so A should be as large as possible, then B, then C, then D.

Since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, we can start with A=9 and try to find suitable B, C, D.

So, let's try A=9.

If A=9, from equation7: A + C=7 or14.

If A=9, then C=7-9=-2 (invalid, since C can't be negative) or C=14-9=5.

So, C=5.

So, for A=9, C=5.

Now, from equation6: B +3C ≡5 mod7.

C=5, so 3C=15≡1 mod7.

Thus, B +1 ≡5 mod7 → B≡4 mod7.

So, B can be4 or11, but since B is a digit, B=4.

So, B=4.

Now, from equation5: D ≡3C -2 mod7.

C=5, so 3C=15, 15-2=13.

13 mod7=6, since 7*1=7, 13-7=6.

So, D≡6 mod7.

So, D can be6 or13, but D is a digit, so D=6.

So, D=6.

So, for A=9, we have C=5, B=4, D=6.

Thus, N=9 4 5 6 →9456.

Now, let's check if this satisfies all the original conditions.

Changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1: 1456.

Compute 1456 ÷7. Let's see: 7*208=1456. Exactly, so 1456 is divisible by7.

2. Change B to1: 9156.

Compute 9156 ÷7. 7*1308=9156. So yes, divisible by7.

3. Change C to1: 9416.

Compute 9416 ÷7. Let's see: 7*1345=9415, so 9415 +1=9416. 9416 -9415=1, so remainder1. Not divisible by7.

Wait, that's a problem. So, 9416 isn't divisible by7, meaning N=9456 doesn't satisfy the condition when changing C to1.

Hmm, so this doesn't work. So, A=9, C=5, B=4, D=6, but N=9456 fails the third condition because changing C to1 gives 9416, which isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps A
