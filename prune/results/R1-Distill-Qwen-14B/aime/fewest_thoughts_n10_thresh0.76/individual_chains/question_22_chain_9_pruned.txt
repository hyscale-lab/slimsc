Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. Hmm, equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length, right? But it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not be equal. The problem also says that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's interesting—so AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. 

The triangle mentioned is formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300 units long. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a hexagon that could be stretched in certain directions but remains convex. Since all sides are equal, it's an equilateral convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. 

I remember that in such hexagons, the sides can be thought of as vectors that form a closed loop. Since it's convex and equilateral, each pair of opposite sides must not only be parallel but also have the same direction or opposite directions? Wait, no, actually, in a convex polygon, opposite sides being parallel might mean they are in the same direction or opposite, but in a hexagon, it's a bit more complex.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using vectors or coordinate geometry. Maybe placing the hexagon on a coordinate system to make it easier.

Let me consider the hexagon as a combination of vectors. Since it's convex and equilateral, each side has the same magnitude, say 's'. The opposite sides are parallel, so their direction vectors must be the same or negatives of each other. 

Let me denote the sides as vectors. Let’s say AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA are the consecutive sides. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA.

So, in terms of vectors:
- AB = DE
- BC = EF
- CD = FA

But since it's a hexagon, the sum of all vectors should be zero because the hexagon is a closed shape.

So, AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 0.

But substituting the opposites:

AB + BC + CD + AB + BC + CD = 0

Wait, that would mean
