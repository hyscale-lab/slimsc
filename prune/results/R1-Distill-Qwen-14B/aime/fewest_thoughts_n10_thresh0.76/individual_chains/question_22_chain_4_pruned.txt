Alright, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to visualize it first. It's a six-sided figure with all sides equal, and opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, that sounds like it might be a regular hexagon, but wait, no, because in a regular hexagon, all sides and angles are equal, but here it's just equilateral and with opposite sides parallel. So it's not necessarily regular.

The problem mentions that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, okay, so this triangle is formed by extending three non-consecutive sides of the hexagon. Since it's a convex hexagon, all the extensions should form a triangle outside the hexagon.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. ABCDEF is the hexagon. Extending AB, CD, EF... So AB is one side, CD is three sides away, and EF is five sides away. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Wait, so if AB is extended, and CD is extended, and EF is extended, these lines form a triangle. Interesting.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, each side has length 's'. But the triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. So the triangle is not equilateral but scalene. I need to figure out how the side length 's' relates to these.

I remember that in such hexagons, the sides can be thought of as vectors, and the hexagon being equilateral and with opposite sides parallel makes it a special case, maybe a parallelogon? Or perhaps similar to a regular hexagon but scaled differently.

Wait, another thought. If the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, maybe it's a translation of a regular hexagon but stretched or compressed in some directions. Alternatively, it could be a hexagon that's a combination of two triangles or something like that.

But let me think about the triangle formed by the extensions. The sides AB, CD, and EF are being extended to form a triangle. Let me denote the triangle as T with sides 200, 240, and 300
