Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

The problem says there's a list of positive integers with three properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let's recall what each term means.

- **Sum of the items is 30**: That means when I add up all the numbers in the list, the total is 30.

- **Unique mode is 9**: Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's unique, no other number appears as many times as 9. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.

- **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But here, it's specified that the median is a positive integer and it's not in the list. So, if the median is an integer not in the list, it must be that the two middle numbers average to that integer, which isn't present in the list.

I think the key here is to find the possible structure of the list satisfying all these conditions. Let's try to approach this systematically.

First, let's think about the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. Let's denote the frequency of 9 as k, so k is at least 2 because it's the mode. But how does that affect the rest of the list?

Also, the sum is 30, so if 9 appears k times, the sum contributed by 9s is 9k. The remaining sum is 30 - 9k, which must be distributed among the other numbers in the list.

Now, the median. If the median isn't in the list, that tells me something about the structure of the list. Let's consider the number of elements in the list. Let me denote the number of elements as n. So, the median depends on whether n is odd or even.

If n is odd, the median is the ((n+1)/2)th term. If n is even, it's the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th terms. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, in the even case, the average of those two terms must be an integer, so those two terms should either both be integers and their average is also integer, which is always true if they are integers. But their average isn't in the list. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, the median is 8, which isn't in the list.

Alternatively, if n is odd, the median is one of the terms, but it's not in the list. Wait, that can't be possible because if n is odd, the median is the middle term, which is in the list. So the median can't be in the list only if n is even? Because when n is even, the median is the average of two numbers, which might not be in the list.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If n is even, the median is the average of the two middle terms. If those two terms are the same, then the median is that number, which would be in the list. So to have the median not in the list, the two middle terms must be different, and their average is an integer not present in the list. For example, if the two middle terms are 7 and 9, the median is 8, which isn't in the list.

So, the median being a positive integer not in the list implies that n is even, and the two middle numbers are distinct, and their average isn't present in the list.

So, let's try to figure out possible values of n.

I think it would help to consider possible values of n and see which ones fit the conditions.

Let me start by considering the number of elements n in the list.

First, since 9 is the mode, it appears more times than any other number. So let's think about the possible number of 9s.

Let me suppose that 9 appears k times, and k is the maximum frequency. So, all other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

Now, considering that the sum is 30, and 9 appears k times, let's see possible k.

Let's try k=3. Then, 3*9=27. The remaining sum is 3, which would have to be distributed among other numbers, each appearing at most 2 times.

But let's think about the median. Let's consider how many numbers we have, n.

Let me try to find n first.

If n is even, say n=8, then the median is average of 4th and 5th terms.

If n=10, median is average of 5th and 6th terms.

Wait, perhaps n can't be too large because 9 appears multiple times, and the sum is 30.

Wait, let's think about the minimum possible n.

Each element is a positive integer, so the smallest possible n is 1,
