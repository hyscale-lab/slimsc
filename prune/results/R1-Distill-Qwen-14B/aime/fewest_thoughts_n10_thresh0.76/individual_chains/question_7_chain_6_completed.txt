Okay, so I have this problem where each vertex of a regular octagon is colored either red or blue, each with equal probability. I need to find the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. Each vertex can be colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability that there exists some rotation (by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°) such that when we rotate the octagon, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. In other words, the set of blue vertices must map to the set of red vertices under some rotation.

Wait, so if we have a rotation that maps blue vertices to red vertices, that would mean that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, this is equivalent to the set of blue vertices being a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the coloring must be such that the blue and red sets are rotations of each other.

Let me think about the structure of such colorings. Let's denote the set of blue vertices as B and red as R. Since each vertex is colored either red or blue, B and R are complementary sets. So, if B is a rotation of R, then R must also be a rotation of B. So, R and B are related by a rotation.

But wait, since the octagon is regular, any rotation that maps B to R must also map R to B. So, how does this affect the coloring?

Alternatively, perhaps the coloring is such that there's a rotation that sends B to R, which implies that B is a rotated version of R, but since R is the complement of B, this implies that B is a rotated version of its own complement.

Hmm, that might be a bit abstract. Maybe another approach: think about the orbits of the vertices under the rotation group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of group actions. The octagon's rotation group is cyclic of order 8. So, each rotation can be represented as a permutation of the vertices. So, the problem is about colorings where there's some group element (rotation) that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices.

But since red and blue are complementary, this is equivalent to saying that B is a rotated version of R, which is itself a rotated version of B. So, maybe B is a union of orbits under the rotation group. But wait, in a regular octagon, the only orbits under rotation are the single orbits since it's a regular polygon. Wait, no, that's not right. Each vertex is in an orbit of size 8 under the full rotation group, but if you have a coloring that's fixed under some rotation, then the orbits are smaller.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using Burnside's lemma or something similar. Burnside's lemma counts the number of distinct colorings under group actions, but in this case, we're looking for colorings that are fixed under some group action, but not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding colorings where the set of blue vertices is a union of some rotationally symmetric subsets.

Wait, another thought: for the octagon, the rotation that maps blue to red must be such that the blue vertices are a rotation of the red ones. So, the blue set must be a shift of the red set. Since the octagon is cyclic, let's model the vertices as numbers 0 through 7 arranged in a circle. Then, a rotation by k positions would map vertex i to i + k mod 8.

So, if B is a shifted version of R, then for some k, (B + k) mod 8 = R. But since R is the complement of B, this would mean that (B + k) mod 8 = complement(B). So, B + k = complement(B) mod 8.

Alternatively, this would imply that B is a shifted version of its own complement. So, for some k, B is equal to complement(B + k). Let me write that down:

B = (complement(B) + k) mod 8.

Which implies that B union (B + k) = the entire set, since complement(B) is R, and R +k would be the shifted R. Wait, but this might not make much sense. Maybe it's better to think about specific cases.

Wait, perhaps the set B must form a rotationally symmetric pattern that is its own complement when rotated by k positions. So, for example, if we rotate B by k, we get R, which is the complement of B.

Let me consider possible values of k. Since the octagon has 8 sides, the possible rotation shifts are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 positions. But shift by 0 is the identity, so that would mean B = R, which is only possible if B is empty or the entire set, but since each vertex is colored either red or blue, and the probability is non-zero, we can ignore k=0 because then either all are red or all are blue. But the probability in that case is 2 / 256 = 1/128, which is very small, but I don't know if that's the only case.

Wait, but the problem says "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, that might include the identity rotation, which would require that all blue vertices are red, which is only possible if there are zero blue vertices. Similarly, the full rotation would require all red to blue, but that's only possible if all are blue.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way to think about it. The problem says that after some rotation, the blue vertices end up where red vertices were. So, for each blue vertex, after rotation, it's now on a red vertex's original position. So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, if R is the set of red vertices, then B must be R shifted by some k.

Wait, but since B is the complement of R, then B = R shifted by k? That would imply that R shifted by k is the complement of R. So, R + k = complement(R). So, R is a subset such that when you shift it by k positions, you get its complement.

So, the problem reduces to finding all subsets R of the octagon's vertices such that R shifted by some k is equal to R's complement.

So, the number of such subsets R would give us the number of colorings where the blue vertices (which are R's complement) can be rotated to R.

Wait, but R is the set of red vertices, and B is the set of blue. So, if B is a shift of R, then indeed, B = R + k mod 8. But since B is the complement of R, that would mean R + k = complement(R). So, R is a subset such that R + k = complement(R) for some k.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to counting all subsets R of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} where R + k = complement(R) for some k. Each such R would correspond to a valid coloring where B = complement(R) is a shift of R.

So, perhaps I should count all such R's. Then, the number of valid colorings would be equal to the number of such R's. Let me think about how to count these.

First, note that each such R must satisfy R + k = complement(R). Let's denote n = 8. So, R is a subset of Z_8 such that R + k = R^c, where R^c is the complement of R in Z_8, and k is some element of Z_8.

So, R + k = R^c implies that R = R^c - k. Since R^c is the complement of R, R = (Z_8 \ R) - k. Alternatively, R = Z_8 \ (R + k). Hmm, maybe I can write this as R union (R + k) = Z_8, and R intersect (R + k) = empty set.

Wait, but R + k = R^c, so every element in R + k is in R^c, and every element in R^c is in R + k. So, R and R + k are complements.

So, for each k, how many R satisfy R + k = R^c? Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of R such that R + k = R^c is either 0 or 1, depending on whether such a subset exists.

Wait, but let's take an example.

Suppose k = 0. Then R + 0 = R, so R = R^c. The only way this can happen is if R is empty or the entire set. So, for k=0, there are two such subsets: the empty set and the full set.

But in our problem, the colorings are such that each vertex is colored either red or blue, so the empty set would correspond to all blue, and the full set would correspond to all red. So, two colorings here, each with probability 1/256.

Similarly, for other k, perhaps we can find R such that R + k = R^c.

Let me try for k=1.

Suppose R + 1 = R^c. Then, R is equal to R^c -1. So, R = (Z_8 \ R) - 1.

Let me write this as R = (Z_8 \ R) - 1.

Then, R union (R + 1) = Z_8, and R intersect (R +1) = empty set.

So, let's see, each element in R must not be in R + 1. Let's model this with equations.

Let me consider each element in Z_8.

Suppose R contains element i. Then, it cannot contain i+1 mod 8. So, R cannot have two consecutive elements. But also, since R +1 is R^c, every element in R^c must be in R +1.

Wait, so for each element j in R^c, there exists some i in R such that j = i +1 mod 8. So, every element not in R is exactly one more than some element in R. So, R must be such that each element in R^c is the successor of some element in R. Which implies that R is a subset where each element in R is followed by an element not in R, but the next element after that could be in R or not.

Wait, maybe a more concrete approach. Let's try to see if such a set R exists for k=1.

Suppose R = {0, 2, 4, 6}. Then, R +1 = {1,3,5,7}, which is R^c. So yes, R +1 = R^c. So, this is a valid R.

Similarly, R could be {1,3,5,7}, and R +1 would be {2,4,6,0}, which is R^c. So, that works too.

Wait, so for k=1, the possible R's are the even or odd positions?

Wait, no. Wait, in the example above, R is {0,2,4,6}, which are the even positions. R +1 is {1,3,5,7}, which is the odd positions. So, R +1 is R^c. So, R is a subset where every element in R is even, and R +1 is the complement.

Similarly, if R is the odd positions, then R +1 would be the even positions, which is R^c. So, for k=1, we have two such subsets: the even and the odd positions.

Wait, but {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} are both valid. So, for k=1, there are two subsets R that satisfy R +1 = R^c.

Similarly, maybe for k=2, let's see.

Suppose R +2 = R^c. Then, R is such that when you shift it by 2, you get its complement.

Let me try R = {0,1,4,5}. Then R +2 mod8 is {2,3,6,7}, which is R^c because R is {0,1,4,5}, so R^c is {2,3,6,7}. So, yes, this works.

Similarly, R could be {2,3,6,7}, and R +2 would be {4,5,0,1}, which is R^c. So, for k=2, there are two such subsets.

Wait, so for k=2, the subsets R would consist of two blocks: {0,1} and {4,5}, and their complements would be {2,3,6,7} and vice versa.

Similarly, for other k's.

Wait, perhaps in general, for each k that is a divisor of 8, we have such subsets.

Wait, 8's divisors are 1,2,4,8.

So, for k=1, as we saw, R can be the even or odd positions. For k=2, R can be the first and third quartets or something.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of orbits under rotation by k steps.

Let me think, for a given k, the permutation induced by rotation by k can be broken down into cycles. The number of cycles is gcd(k,8). So, for k=1, gcd(1,8)=1, so the permutation is a single 8-cycle. For k=2, gcd(2,8)=2, so two 4-cycles. For k=4, gcd(4,8)=4, so four 2-cycles. For k=8, it's the identity.

Wait, perhaps the number of such R's depends on the cycle structure.

Wait, if the permutation breaks into c cycles, then the number of possible R's satisfying R +k = R^c is 2^c, perhaps? Because in each cycle, you can choose whether to include elements in R or not, but with some constraints.

Wait, but in our earlier example, for k=1, which is a single 8-cycle, we had two possible R's: the even and the odd positions. So, 2^1=2, which matches. For k=2, which has two 4-cycles, we had two possible R's. Hmm, but 2^2=4, which doesn't match. So maybe that approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps another way: for each cycle in the permutation, the elements in each cycle must be assigned in such a way that R and R^c satisfy R +k = R^c.

Wait, perhaps for each cycle, if you include an element in R, you cannot include the next element in R, but for the complement, you must include the next element.

Wait, maybe it's better to model each cycle as a separate problem.

Take k=1, which is a single 8-cycle: 0→1→2→3→4→5→6→7→0.

For R +1 = R^c, each element in R must not be followed by another element of R, because if i is in R, then i+1 is in R^c. So, in the cycle, R must be a subset where no two consecutive elements are included.

So, the number of such subsets R in a single 8-cycle where no two consecutive elements are included is known to be the Fibonacci number F(9) = 34, but wait, that's for binary necklaces. Hmm, maybe not exactly.

Wait, no, actually, the number of subsets of an 8-element cycle with no two consecutive elements is F(8) = 21, where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number, with F(1)=1, F(2)=2, etc. But wait, for a cycle, it's F(n) + F(n-2). Wait, I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps for a linear chain of n elements, the number of subsets with no two consecutive elements is F(n+2). For a cycle, it's F(n) + F(n-2). So for n=8, it would be F(8) + F(6). F(8)=21, F(6)=8, so 29. But that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute it.

For a linear arrangement, the number of subsets with no two consecutive elements is F(n+2), where F is the Fibonacci sequence. So for n=8, that's F(10)=55.

But for a cycle, it's a bit different because the first and last elements are adjacent. So the formula is F(n) + F(n-2). So for n=8, F(8) + F(6) = 21 + 8 = 29.

But wait, in our case, if R is a subset where no two elements are consecutive, then R +1 = R^c. So, for k=1, the number of such R is 2, not 29. So this approach is not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the problem.

We saw that when k=1, R could be the even positions or the odd positions, giving two possible subsets. Similarly, when k=2, R could be {0,1,4,5} and {2,3,6,7}, giving two more subsets.

Wait, but let me check for k=3.

Suppose k=3. Let's see if R exists such that R +3 = R^c.

Let me try R = {0,3,6}. Then R +3 = {3,6,1}, which is {1,3,6}. But R^c is {1,2,4,5,7}. So, that's not equal. So, that doesn't work.

Another try: R = {0,1,2,3}. R +3 = {3,4,5,6}. R^c is {4,5,6,7}. Not equal.

Wait, maybe R = {0,2,5,7}. Then R +3 = {3,5,8≡0,10≡2}. So, {0,2,3,5}. R^c is {1,3,4,6,7}. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe there's no such R for k=3. Alternatively, perhaps R is the entire set or empty, but that only works for k=0.

Wait, perhaps only for k where 2k ≡0 mod8, meaning k is 0,4. Because if R +k = R^c, then applying the rotation twice would give R +2k = R^c +k = (R +k)^c = R^c. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps if R +k = R^c, then (R +k) +k = R^c +k = (R +2k) = (R^c)^c = R. So, R +2k = R. So, 2k must be congruent to 0 mod8, meaning k is 0,4.

So, only when k=0 and k=4 can such R exist.

Wait, that's an important point. So, let me write that down.

If R +k = R^c, then applying the rotation again, we get (R +k) +k = R +2k = (R^c) +k = R^c^c = R. So, R +2k = R. Which implies that 2k ≡0 mod8. So, 2k ≡0 mod8 ⇒ k ≡0 mod4. So, k can be 0,4 in Z_8.

So, this implies that only for k=0 and k=4 can such subsets R exist.

Wait, that's a significant simplification. So, the only possible k's are 0 and 4.

So, for k=0: R +0 = R = R^c. So, R must be equal to its own complement. Which only happens when R is the empty set or the entire set. So, two subsets.

For k=4: R +4 = R^c. So, let's find subsets R where R +4 = R^c.

Let's model the octagon as vertices 0 through 7, arranged in a circle. So, adding 4 mod8 is equivalent to mapping each vertex to the one directly opposite.

So, R +4 is the set of vertices opposite to those in R. So, if R +4 = R^c, then every vertex in R must be opposite to a vertex not in R, and vice versa.

Wait, but the octagon has an even number of vertices, so each vertex has a unique opposite vertex.

Wait, let me think about this: For R +4 = R^c, every element in R, when you add 4, must be in R^c. So, for any i in R, i +4 is in R^c. So, R cannot contain both i and i+4, because if i is in R, then i+4 is in R^c, so not in R. Similarly, if i is in R^c, then i+4 is in R.

Wait, so R must consist of pairs of opposite vertices, but not including both a vertex and its opposite. So, R can include either a vertex or its opposite, but not both.

But wait, in the octagon, each vertex has an opposite. So, the entire set can be partitioned into four pairs of opposite vertices: {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}.

So, for R, we can choose any subset of these four pairs, selecting one vertex from each pair. So, for each pair, we have two choices: include the first or the second element. So, for four pairs, that's 2^4=16 possible subsets.

Wait, but wait. If R is such that for each pair {i, i+4}, exactly one is in R and the other is in R^c. So, R can be any subset where for each of the four pairs, exactly one element is chosen. So, that gives 2^4 =16 possible subsets.

Each of these subsets R will satisfy R +4 = R^c, because for each i in R, i+4 is not in R, so i+4 is in R^c, and for each j in R^c, j+4 is in R because j is not in R, but j+4 is the opposite, which is not in R^c, so it's in R.

Wait, but let me check this.

Take R = {0,1,2,3}. Then R +4 = {4,5,6,7} = R^c. So, yes, that works.

Another example: R = {0,2,4,6}. Then R +4 = {4,6,0,2} = R, which is not equal to R^c. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, so in this case, R +4 is R, so R +4 ≠ R^c. So, this subset wouldn't satisfy R +4 = R^c.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier reasoning was incorrect.

Wait, let me think again. If R is {0,1,2,3}, then R +4 = {4,5,6,7} = R^c. That works. Similarly, R = {0,2,4,6} would have R +4 = {4,6,0,2} = R, which is not R^c. So, that subset does not satisfy R +4 = R^c. So, my earlier reasoning that all subsets formed by choosing one from each opposite pair would satisfy R +4 = R^c is incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps I need a better approach.

Let me consider that R is a subset where for each pair {i, i+4}, exactly one is in R and the other is in R^c. So, R must include exactly one from each opposite pair. So, for four pairs, 2^4=16 subsets.

But as I saw earlier, some of these subsets do not satisfy R +4 = R^c. For example, R={0,2,4,6} includes all the even positions, but R +4 is {4,6,0,2} which is the same as R, which is not equal to R^c unless R is empty or the full set.

Wait, so maybe only certain subsets of these 16 satisfy R +4 = R^c.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that R +4 = R^c. So, let's model this.

If R is a subset, then R +4 is the set of elements opposite to those in R. So, for R +4 to equal R^c, each element in R^c must be the opposite of an element in R, and vice versa.

Wait, so that would mean that for every element j not in R, there's an element i in R such that j = i +4. So, R must consist of elements such that their opposites are precisely all the elements not in R. Thus, R must be a set where every element's opposite is not in R, and every element not in R is the opposite of some element in R.

Which would imply that R must consist of exactly one element from each opposite pair. So, for each pair {i, i+4}, exactly one is in R and the other is not. Thus, R must be a subset where for each pair, exactly one is included. So, there are 2^4=16 such subsets.

But wait, earlier I saw that R={0,1,2,3} satisfies R +4 = R^c, which is correct because R +4 is {4,5,6,7}, which is R^c.

Similarly, R={0,1,3,4} would have R +4 = {4,5,7,0}, which is R^c. Let me check: R = {0,1,3,4}, R^c = {2,5,6,7}. R +4 = {4,5,7,0}, which is indeed {0,4,5,7}, which is not equal to R^c. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, let me compute R +4 correctly. For R = {0,1,3,4}, adding 4 mod8 gives:

0 +4 =4

1 +4=5

3 +4=7

4 +4=0.

So, R +4 = {4,5,7,0}.

But R^c is the complement of R, which is {2,5,6,7}.

So, R +4 is {0,4,5,7}, which is not equal to R^c. So, this subset R doesn't satisfy R +4 = R^c.

Hmm, so perhaps not all subsets where exactly one from each opposite pair are included will satisfy R +4 = R^c. So, maybe only certain specific subsets do.

Wait, let me think about what R must look like. If R +4 = R^c, then for any i, if i is in R, then i+4 is in R^c, and if i is in R^c, then i+4 is in R.

So, for each pair {i, i+4}, exactly one is in R, and the other is in R^c. So, that's the same as choosing one from each pair, as I thought earlier. But in that case, why didn't R={0,1,3,4} satisfy R +4 = R^c?

Wait, let me compute R^c for R={0,1,3,4}. It's {2,5,6,7}. R +4 = {4,5,7,0}, which is {0,4,5,7}, which is not the same as R^c. So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, maybe the condition R +4 = R^c implies more than just choosing one from each opposite pair.

Alternatively, perhaps the subsets R must form a system where each element i is either in R or i+4 is in R, but not both. And in this case, R +4 is exactly R^c.

Wait, but R +4 is the set of all i+4 for i in R. So, for R +4 to be R^c, it must be that every element not in R is equal to some i+4 where i is in R, and no element in R is equal to any j+4 where j is in R.

Wait, that seems similar to a partition.

Wait, perhaps R must be such that R and R +4 are complementary.

So, R +4 = R^c.

So, for R to satisfy this, R must be a subset where each element in R is paired with its opposite in R^c.

But perhaps this only works when R is a union of certain orbits.

Wait, let me take an example where R +4 = R^c.

Take R = {0,1,2,3}. Then R +4 = {4,5,6,7}, which is R^c. So, that works.

Similarly, R = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} would give R +4 = R, which would only equal R^c if R is empty or the full set, which is only possible for R being empty or full, which we've already considered for k=0.

Wait, what about R = {0,1,4,5}? Then R +4 = {4,5,0,1}, which is R itself, so R +4 = R, which would only equal R^c if R is empty or the full set, which isn't the case here. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, but earlier I thought R = {0,1,4,5} would work for k=2, but perhaps that's a different case. Maybe I confused k=2 and k=4.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this problem by considering that for each k, the number of R's is 2^{c}, where c is the number of orbits under the rotation by k. But earlier, for k=4, it's two 4-cycles, but no, wait, gcd(4,8)=4, so the permutation breaks into 4 cycles of length 2. Wait, no, the permutation for k=4 is the same as adding 4, which maps each element to its opposite. So, each cycle is a pair {i, i+4}, so there are 4 cycles, each of length 2.

Wait, so if I have 4 cycles, then for each cycle, I can choose whether to include one element or the other, but in a way that R +4 = R^c. So, for each pair {i, i+4}, if I include i in R, then i+4 must be in R^c, which is exactly the condition. So, for each pair, I can choose whether to include the first or the second element. So, for 4 pairs, that's 2^4=16 subsets R.

But earlier, I saw that not all of these subsets satisfy R +4 = R^c. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe some of these subsets do satisfy the condition, and others don't.

Wait, let me test R = {0,1,2,3}. As we saw, R +4 = {4,5,6,7} = R^c, so that works. Similarly, R = {0,2,4,6} gives R +4 = {4,6,0,2} = R, which is not R^c unless R is empty or full. So, that doesn't work. So, perhaps only certain subsets among the 16 satisfy R +4 = R^c.

Wait, maybe the subsets R where R is a union of some of the opposite pairs such that the subset forms a system where the complement is the shifted version.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a linear code or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that for R +4 = R^c, R must be a self-complementary set under rotation by 4.

Wait, perhaps each such R is a set where it's a union of certain opposite pairs, but arranged in a way that when you shift by 4, you get the complement.

Wait, let me think of R as a subset where for each i, if i is in R, then i+4 is not in R, and if i is not in R, then i+4 is in R.

Which is exactly the condition that R and R +4 are complementary.

So, in that case, R must be such that R and R +4 are complementary. So, for each i, i is in R if and only if i+4 is not in R.

Which implies that R is a subset where for each pair {i, i+4}, exactly one is included. So, as I thought before, there are 2^4=16 such subsets.

But as I saw earlier, some of these subsets satisfy R +4 = R^c, while others don't. Wait, but in the example R={0,1,2,3}, R +4 = {4,5,6,7} = R^c.

Similarly, R={0,1,3,4} would have R +4 = {4,5,7,0} which is not equal to R^c.

Wait, so perhaps only the subsets that are unions of entire orbits under a rotation of order 2 (i.e., shifting by 4) would satisfy R +4 = R^c.

Wait, for example, if R is the entire set of even vertices, then R +4 would be the same as R, which is not equal to R^c unless R is empty or the full set.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should take a different approach.

Since we've established that only for k=0 and k=4 do there exist subsets R such that R +k = R^c, and for each of these k's, the number of such R's is 2, let's consider that.

For k=0, as we saw, only R=empty and R=full set satisfy R +0 = R^c. So, two subsets.

For k=4, perhaps the number of R's is also two? But earlier I saw that R={0,1,2,3} and R={4,5,6,7} satisfy R +4 = R^c.

Wait, let me check:

If R = {0,1,2,3}, then R +4 = {4,5,6,7} = R^c.

If R = {4,5,6,7}, then R +4 = {0,1,2,3} = R^c.

Similarly, if R = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, then R +4 would be R, which only equals R^c if R is empty or full, which is allowed for k=0, but for k=4, perhaps only those two subsets (the first four and the last four) satisfy R +4 = R^c.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were 16 subsets, but maybe only two of them satisfy R +4 = R^c.

Wait, let me try R = {0,1,4,5}. Then R +4 = {4,5,0,1} = R, which is not equal to R^c unless R is empty or full.

So, that doesn't work.

Another example: R = {0,2,4,6}. R +4 = {4,6,0,2} = R, which again is not equal to R^c.

Hmm, so perhaps the only subsets R that satisfy R +4 = R^c are R = {0,1,2,3} and R = {4,5,6,7}. Let me verify:

If R = {0,1,2,3}, then R +4 = {4,5,6,7} = R^c.

Similarly, if R = {4,5,6,7}, then R +4 = {0,1,2,3} = R^c.

So, that works, and these are the only two subsets for k=4.

Wait, then the total number of such R's would be 2 (for k=0) + 2 (for k=4) = 4.

But wait, when k=0, the subsets are R=empty and R=full. When k=4, the subsets are R={0,1,2,3} and R={4,5,6,7}.

So, in total, 4 subsets R such that R +k = R^c for some k.

Wait, but earlier I thought for k=1, there were two subsets, but according to our earlier deduction, only k=0 and k=4 are possible, because 2k must be 0 mod8, meaning k must be 0 or 4.

Wait, so perhaps the only possible R's are those where R is empty, full, or R is one of the two four-element subsets {0,1,2,3} and {4,5,6,7}.

So, in total, 4 subsets.

But then, the number of valid colorings would be 4, each corresponding to R being one of these four subsets. So, each coloring would have either all red, all blue, or the two four-element subsets.

Wait, but let me check for k=4 again. R = {0,1,2,3} gives B = R^c = {4,5,6,7}, which is the set of blue vertices. So, when we rotate by 4 positions, the blue vertices {4,5,6,7} would move to positions {0,1,2,3}, which were originally red. So, that's valid.

Similarly, R = {4,5,6,7} would give B = {0,1,2,3}, which when rotated by 4 would move to {4,5,6,7}, which were originally red.

So, that works.

Similarly, R being empty would mean all blue, and the identity rotation would work. Similarly, R being full would mean all red, and the identity would work.

So, the total number of colorings that satisfy the condition is 4: all red, all blue, R={0,1,2,3}, and R={4,5,6,7}.

Wait, but that seems too small. Because for each of these R's, the coloring is determined, but perhaps I'm missing some other R's for k=4.

Wait, let me consider another R for k=4. Let's take R = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, which is the full set. Then R +4 = R, which equals R^c only if R is empty or full. So, that's handled in k=0.

Similarly, R = {} would give R +4 = {} = R^c, which is handled in k=0.

But for k=4, perhaps only R = {0,1,2,3} and R = {4,5,6,7} satisfy R +4 = R^c.

So, in total, four subsets R.

Thus, the number of valid colorings is four. Each of these corresponds to a specific R, so four colorings where either all are red, all are blue, or the blue vertices are in one of the two four-element subsets that are complements of each other under rotation by 4.

So, the probability would be 4 / 256 = 1/64.

Wait, but that seems too low. Because in addition to these four colorings, perhaps there are others where the blue set is a rotation of the red set under some other rotation.

Wait, but earlier I thought that only k=0 and k=4 are possible because 2k must be 0 mod8. So, only for k=0 and k=4, R +k = R^c.

But perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine that.

We had the condition that R +k = R^c.

Applying the rotation again, we get R +2k = (R +k) +k = R^c +k.

But R^c +k = (R +k)^c.

Wait, because R^c is the complement of R, so (R +k)^c is the complement of R +k, which is R^c +k.

Wait, but R +2k = R^c +k.

But since R +2k must equal R, because R +2k = (R +k) +k = (R^c) +k.

Wait, but (R^c) +k is equal to (R +k)^c, which is R^c +k.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition R +k = R^c implies that R +2k = R.

So, R +2k = R ⇒ 2k ≡0 mod8 ⇒ k ≡0 mod4.

Therefore, only k=0 and k=4 are possible in Z_8.

Thus, only for these two k's can such R exist.

Therefore, the total number of valid R's is 2 (for k=0) + 2 (for k=4) = 4.

Therefore, the number of valid colorings is 4.

So, the probability is 4 / 256 = 1/64. Therefore, m=1, n=64, and m +n=65.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for k=1, there were two subsets R that worked, but according to this, it's not possible because k=1 doesn't satisfy 2k ≡0 mod8. So, perhaps my earlier assumption was wrong.

Wait, let me check for k=1. Suppose R +1 = R^c. Then, applying again, R +2 = (R +1) +1 = R^c +1 = (R +1)^c = R^c^c = R. So, R +2 = R ⇒ 2 ≡0 mod8 ⇒ 2 ≡0 mod8, which is false. So, such a R cannot exist for k=1.

Similarly, for k=2: R +2 = R^c. Then, R +4 = (R +2) +2 = R^c +2 = (R +2)^c = R^c^c = R. So, R +4 = R ⇒ 4≡0 mod8 ⇒ yes.

So, R +4 = R. So, in this case, R is a subset fixed under rotation by 4. So, R must be a union of orbits under rotation by 4, which are the pairs {i, i+4}.

So, R can be any subset formed by choosing any combination of these pairs. So, for four pairs, 2^4=16 subsets.

But for each such R, R +2 = R^c?

Wait, no, because if R is a union of some opposite pairs, then R +2 would not necessarily be R^c.

Wait, perhaps it's more complicated. But according to the earlier condition, only when 2k ≡0 mod8, so k=0,4.

Therefore, only for k=0 and k=4, such R exists.

Thus, the total number of valid colorings is 4, as before.

Therefore, the probability is 4/256=1/64. So, m=1, n=64, m +n=65.

Wait, but that seems low, and I might have missed some colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set under other rotations.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently.

The problem states that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up where the red ones were. This is equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, for some rotation k, B = R +k.

But since B is the complement of R, B = R^c. So, R^c = R +k ⇒ R +k = R^c.

Which implies R +2k = R, so 2k ≡0 mod8 ⇒ k≡0 mod4.

Thus, only rotations by 0,4 positions would allow R +k = R^c.

Therefore, as before, only four subsets R satisfy this condition, leading to four colorings.

Thus, the probability is 4/256=1/64, so m +n=1+64=65.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the empty set and full set are counted for k=0, and the other two subsets are for k=4, so four total.

But let me check: R being empty, then B is full. Rotating by 0, which is the identity, so blue vertices stay where they are, which were all red. But wait, if all are blue, then rotating by 0 would require that all blue vertices are where red ones were, which is only possible if all were red, but in this case, all are blue. So, that's a contradiction. So, perhaps the empty and full sets shouldn't be counted.

Wait, no. If R is empty, then B is full. Then, rotating by 0, the blue vertices (all of them) would have to be where the red vertices (which are empty) were. That's not possible. So, perhaps the empty set and full set don't satisfy the condition for k=0.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if R is empty, then B is full. Then, for the condition to hold, there must be a rotation that maps B (full) to R (empty). But that's impossible, since B is full and R is empty. So, the only way B can be mapped to R is if B is empty and R is full, but that's only possible if all vertices are red, which is only when B is empty.

Wait, so perhaps only R being empty and B being full would satisfy the condition, but only if R is empty. Wait, no, because if R is empty, B is full. Then, to map B to R via rotation, you would need a rotation that maps all vertices to the empty set, which is impossible unless B is empty, which it isn't.

Similarly, if R is full, B is empty, which would require a rotation that maps B (empty) to R (full), which is impossible.

Therefore, perhaps the only valid R's are those for k=4, which are R = {0,1,2,3} and R = {4,5,6,7}. So, two subsets.

Thus, the number of valid colorings would be two, each corresponding to R being {0,1,2,3} or {4,5,6,7}.

Therefore, the probability would be 2/256=1/128, giving m +n=129.

But wait, earlier when R={0,1,2,3}, B={4,5,6,7}. Rotating by 4 positions would map B to R, so that works. Similarly, R={4,5,6,7}, B={0,1,2,3}, and rotating by 4 would map B to R.

So, these two colorings are valid.

But earlier, considering R=empty and R=full, we saw they don't work. So, the total number of valid colorings is two.

Thus, probability is 2/256=1/128, so m +n=129.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for each rotation, the number of colorings fixed by that rotation is counted, and then use Burnside's lemma to find the number of colorings that are fixed by at least one rotation.

Wait, Burnside's lemma states that the number of distinct colorings under the group action is equal to the average number of fixed colorings per group element.

But in this problem, we're looking for colorings that are fixed under some rotation, but not necessarily all. So, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion principle is needed.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each rotation that maps B to R contributes to the count.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for each rotation, count the number of colorings fixed by that rotation, then use inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation.

But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to counting the number of colorings where B is a rotated version of R, which for a regular octagon, would require that B is a shift of R.

But since R is the complement of B, this implies B is a shift of its complement.

So, in that case, the only possibilities are the two four-element subsets I found earlier, leading to two valid colorings.

Thus, the probability would be 2/256=1/128, so m +n=129.

But I'm a bit uncertain because earlier I thought there were four, but upon re-examining the empty and full sets, they don't satisfy the condition, leaving only two.

Wait, let me think again: if R is empty, then B is full. There is no rotation that can map B (full) to R (empty), except if B is empty, which it's not. So, R=empty isn't a valid solution.

Similarly, R=full would require B=empty, which can't be mapped to R=full by any rotation except if B=full, which it isn't.

Thus, only the two four-element subsets R={0,1,2,3} and R={4,5,6,7} are valid, leading to two colorings where B is the complement of R, and B is a rotation of R.

So, the probability is 2/256=1/128.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about whether there are other possible R's. Suppose R is a set with two elements, say {0,4}, then R +4 = {4,0}, which is R itself, so R +4=R, which equals R^c only if R is empty or full, which it isn't. So, that doesn't work.

Another example: R = {0,1,4,5}. Then R +4 = {4,5,0,1} = R, which is not R^c. So, that doesn't work.

Another example: R = {0,2,4,6}. R +4 = {4,6,0,2} = R, which isn't R^c.

Hmm, so perhaps only the two four-element subsets I found earlier work.

Thus, the total number of valid colorings is two, leading to a probability of 2/256=1/128, so m +n=129.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with my previous conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some other subsets.

Wait, maybe I should consider that for k=4, the subsets R must form a system where R is a union of pairs of opposite vertices, and when shifted by 4, they cover the remaining pairs.

Wait, but as I saw earlier, only the two four-element subsets satisfy R +4=R^c.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 2, leading to 1/128 and m +n=129.

But in the initial problem statement, the probability is given as m/n where m and n are coprime, so 1 and 128 are coprime, so m +n=129.

But I'm not fully confident. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the problem is asking for colorings where there exists a rotation such that B is the image of R under that rotation. So, B is a rotated version of R, which is equivalent to saying that B is a shifted version of R.

Since B is the complement of R, this means that the complement of R is a shifted version of R.

So, in terms of set theory, R^c = R +k for some k.

So, the number of such R's is the number of subsets where the complement is a shifted version of R.

As we saw earlier, this only works for k=0 and k=4, and for each k=4, there are two such subsets.

Thus, the total number of valid R's is 2, leading to two colorings. So, the probability is 2/256=1/128.

Thus, the answer is 1 + 128=129.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check some references or examples.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the problem in terms of necklace counting. The number of binary necklaces of length 8 that are equal to their complement under some rotation.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each rotation corresponds to a cyclic shift, and the problem is to find the number of binary strings of length 8 where the string is equal to its complement under some cyclic shift.

This is similar to finding the number of binary necklaces that are symmetric under some rotation.

Wait, but in any case, based on my earlier reasoning, I think the correct answer is 2, leading to a probability of 1/128, so m +n=129.


The problem involves determining the probability that a regular octagon's vertices, each colored red or blue with equal probability, can be rotated such that all blue vertices align with the original red vertices. 

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Total Colorings**: Each vertex can be colored red or blue, yielding \(2^8 = 256\) total possible colorings.

2. **Condition for Rotation**: For a valid coloring, there must exist a rotation \(k\) such that the set of blue vertices \(B\) is a rotation of the set of red vertices \(R\). This implies \(B = R + k \mod 8\), where \(B\) is the complement of \(R\).

3. **Complementary Sets**: Since \(B = R^c\), the condition becomes \(R^c = R + k \mod 8\). Applying the rotation twice gives \(R + 2k = R\), implying \(2k \equiv 0 \mod 8\). Thus, \(k\) must be a multiple of 4, i.e., \(k = 0\) or \(k = 4\).

4. **Valid Subsets for \(k = 0\)**:
   - \(k = 0\) requires \(R = R^c\), which is only possible if \(R\) is either the empty set or the full set. However, these cases do not satisfy the problem's condition because rotating an all-blue or all-red octagon cannot map blue vertices to red positions unless all vertices are the same color, which is a trivial case.

5. **Valid Subsets for \(k = 4\)**:
   - For \(k = 4\), the condition \(R^c = R + 4 \mod 8\) implies that \(R\) must be a subset where each element and its opposite (4 positions away) are not both in \(R\). The valid subsets are:
     - \(R = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
     - \(R = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}\)
   - These subsets satisfy \(R + 4 = R^c\), meaning rotating by 4 positions maps blue vertices to red positions.

6. **Counting Valid Colorings**: There are 2 valid subsets \(R\) that satisfy the condition, leading to 2 valid colorings.

7. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{256} = \frac{1}{128}
   \]
   Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 128\), which are coprime.

8. **Final Answer**: The sum \(m + n = 1 + 128 = 129\).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{129}
