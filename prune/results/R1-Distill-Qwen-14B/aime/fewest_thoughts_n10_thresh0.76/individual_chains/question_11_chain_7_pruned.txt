Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out.

First, since z is a complex number with magnitude 4, that means z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, z can also be expressed as 4(cosθ + isinθ). That's using Euler's formula. So, I can represent z as 4e^{iθ}.

Wait, but sometimes it's easier to write z as a complex number a + ib, but since we know |z| = 4, maybe using polar form will make things simpler, especially when dealing with multiplicative inverses like 1/z.

Let me try expressing z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|², and since |z| is 4, |z|² is 16. So, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting these into the expression, we get:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}

Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i). 4*75 is 300, and 4*117 is 468. So that becomes 300 + 468i, multiplied by e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Compute (1/4)*(96 + 144i). 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So that's 24 + 36i, multiplied by e^{-iθ}.

So now, the expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

I need to find the real part of this expression and then maximize it. So, let me express each term in terms of cosine and sine.

Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's expand both terms.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
But i^2 is -1, so that becomes:
300 cosθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) - 468 sinθ

So, the real part of the first term is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ, and the imaginary part is 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
Again, i^2 is -1, so:
24 cosθ - i(24 sinθ - 36 cosθ) + 36 sinθ

So, the real part of the second term is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ, and the imaginary part is -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ.

Now, adding the two terms together.

The overall expression is first term + second term.

So, real parts:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

But since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on the real part expression: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies. Since θ is a real number, we can model this as a function f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

To find the maximum of f(θ), we can use the method for finding the maximum of a function of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, which is known to be sqrt(A² + B²). But wait, actually, the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). However, in our case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is equivalent to A cosθ + B sinθ, where A = 324 and B = -432.

Wait, no, actually, the expression is f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, so it's A cosθ + B sinθ with A = 324 and B = -432.

But the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). So, the maximum real part is sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute 324 squared and 432 squared.

324²: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300² = 90,000. 24²=576. Then, 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)^2= 300² + 2*300*24 +24²= 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104, 976.

Wait, 90,000 +14,400 is 104,400. 104,400 + 576 is 104,976. So, 324² is 104,976.

432 squared. Let's compute 400² = 160,000. 32²=1,024. 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 +32)^2=400² + 2*400*32 + 32²=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=160,000+25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624.

So, 432² is 186,624.

So, the sum is 104,976 +186,624= 291,600.

So sqrt(291,600) is equal to what? Let me compute sqrt(291600). Let me see, 540² is 291,600 because 500²=250,000, 40²=1,600, and (500+40)^2=500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So sqrt(291600)=540.

So, the maximum value of the real part is 540. So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning.

We have f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). So yes, that's 540. That seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to find the maximum is by using calculus. Take the derivative of f(θ), set it to zero, and solve for θ.

So, f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

f’(θ) = -324 sinθ - 432 cosθ
