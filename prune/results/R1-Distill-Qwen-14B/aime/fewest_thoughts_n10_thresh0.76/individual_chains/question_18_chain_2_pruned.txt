Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon). Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting certain vertices. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact method here. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is (n-2)*180/n, which gives (12-2)*180/12 = 150 degrees per angle.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. A rectangle has four sides with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, in the context of a regular dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must align with either the sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals. That means I need to find sets of four vertices that form such rectangles.

I think the key is to consider the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational and reflectional symmetry. This might mean that the number of rectangles can be determined by looking at how these vertices can be paired symmetrically.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a circle. Each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference. The distance between two vertices can be represented as chords of the circle. Rectangles would correspond to pairs of chords that are equal in length and perpendicular to each other.

But how does that help count the rectangles? Maybe I should think about the coordinates of the vertices. If I place the dodecagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin, each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. The angle between consecutive vertices would be 30 degrees since 360/12 = 30.

So, for each vertex, the positions are at 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., up to 330°. Now, to form a rectangle, I need four points such that the sides are either sides or diagonals. That implies that the sides must be either 30°, 60°, etc., apart.

Wait, perhaps another way: in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by choosing two pairs of diametrically opposite points, but in a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, diametrically opposite points are 6 steps apart. So, for each diameter (a line through the center connecting two opposite vertices), I can pair them with another diameter to form a rectangle.

But that doesn't sound quite right. Because a rectangle requires four points, two from each diameter. So, if I pick two diameters that are perpendicular to each other, that would form a rectangle. But in a dodecagon, the diameters are separated by 30°, 60°, etc. So, when are two diameters perpendicular?

In a circle, two radii are perpendicular if the angle between them is 90°, which corresponds to four steps in the dodecagon (since each step is 30°, 4 steps would be 120°, wait no, 30°*4=120°, that's not 90°. Wait, 30°*3=90°, so three steps would correspond to 90°, so diameters that are three steps apart would be perpendicular.

Wait, but actually, each step is 30°, so the angle between two consecutive diameters is 30°, right? So, if I have a diameter at 0°, the next is at 30°, then 60°, 90°, etc., up to 330°. So, two diameters are perpendicular if the angle
