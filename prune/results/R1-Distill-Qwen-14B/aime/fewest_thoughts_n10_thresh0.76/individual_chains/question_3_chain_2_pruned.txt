Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step. 

First, let's understand the problem. Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize (if you win the grand prize, you definitely win a prize), the intersection is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to calculate P(A) and P(B).

Let me compute P(A) first. P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since 4 numbers are drawn from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10, 4). The number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, because Jen has chosen a specific set of 4 numbers. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10, 4).

Wait, is that right? Let me verify. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is indeed C(10,4). And since Jen has only one specific set of 4 numbers, the probability that all four are drawn is 1 / C(10,4). Okay, that makes sense.

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. This is the probability of winning a prize, which includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen. So, we can calculate P(B) by summing the probabilities of these three scenarios.

Alternatively, since calculating "at least two" can sometimes be tricky, I can use the complementary probability. The probability of at least two is 1 minus the probability of zero or one of her numbers being chosen. Maybe that's easier?

Let's think. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero of her numbers are chosen) - P(exactly one of her numbers is chosen). That might be a more manageable approach.

So, let's compute P(zero) and P(one).

First, P(zero): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S such that none of them are Jen's numbers. Since Jen picked 4 distinct numbers, the remaining numbers in S are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). Therefore, P(zero) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

Similarly, P(one): the number of ways to choose exactly one of Jen's numbers and three from the others. So, that's C(4,1) * C(6,3). Thus, P(one) = [C(4,1) * C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - [C(6,4) + C(4,1
