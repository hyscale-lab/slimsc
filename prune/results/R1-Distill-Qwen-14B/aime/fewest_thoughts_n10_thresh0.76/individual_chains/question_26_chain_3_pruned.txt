Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. So, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. So, D is the intersection of the two tangents. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of AB, BC, and AC: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. We need to find AP, express it as m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m+n.

Hmm. So, the problem involves properties of circles, tangents, and intersecting chords. Let me recall some relevant theorems.

First, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsymmedian point or the symmedian point? Wait, no, actually, D is the external point from which two tangents are drawn to the circle. So, for a circle, the point where two tangents meet is called the external homothety center, but more importantly, the lengths from D to B and D to C should be equal because the two tangent segments from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, DB = DC.

Also, I remember that point D is the ex-center in some contexts, but maybe that's not directly relevant here.

Now, since AD intersects the circumcircle again at P, perhaps we can use the Power of a Point theorem. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points of intersection with the circle. So, DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

Wait, that's correct. So, if I can find DB, then I can relate it to DA and DP. Specifically, DB² = DA * DP. So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then AP = AD + DP, but wait, actually, P is the second intersection point, so AP = AD - DP? Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant. So, the Power of a Point theorem says that DB² = DA * DP. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. But since A is on the circle, AD is a secant that starts at D, passes through A, and ends at P. So, the Power of a Point would be DB² = DA * DP. So, DA * DP = DB². But I need to find AP, which is the length from A to P. So, AP = AD - DP? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, AD is the entire length from A to D, but since P is on the circle, and A is also on the circle, so AP is the chord from A to P. Hmm, but how can I relate this to AD?

Wait, maybe I should consider triangle ABD or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts, but that might be too advanced.

Alternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem? Or perhaps using similar triangles.

Wait, another thought: since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, the line BD is tangent at B, so angle ABD is equal to the angle in the alternate segment, which is angle ACB. Similarly, angle ACD is equal to angle ABC. So, maybe we can use these angle properties to find some similar triangles.

Wait, let's elaborate. The tangent at B makes an angle with BD equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, angle between tangent BD and chord BC is equal to angle BAC. Wait, no, more accurately, the angle between tangent at B and chord BC is equal to angle BAC.

Wait, no, perhaps it's equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, angle between tangent BD and chord BB is equal to angle BAC. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me recall the exact statement.

The angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, for the tangent at B, the angle between BD and BC is equal to angle BAC. Similarly, the angle between tangent at C and CB is equal to angle BAC.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The angle between the tangent at B and the chord BC is equal to the angle that BC makes with BA in the alternate segment. So, angle DBC = angle BAC. Similarly, angle DCB = angle ABC.

So, angle DBC = angle BAC and angle DCB = angle ABC.

So, that might help us in establishing some similar triangles.

Alternatively, another approach: Since D is the ex-tangent point, maybe we can find coordinates for points to calculate the lengths. But that might be a bit involved.

Wait, maybe using coordinates is the
