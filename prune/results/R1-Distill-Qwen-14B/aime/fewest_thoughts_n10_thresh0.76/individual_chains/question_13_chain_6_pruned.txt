Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's walks. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. Hmm, so the walk is always 9 kilometers. She walks at a constant speed, and depending on her speed, the total time she takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop, changes.

The problem gives me two scenarios:

1. When she walks at a speed of s kilometers per hour, her walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at s+2 kilometers per hour, her walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes in the coffee shop.

And the question is: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will the walk take her, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop?

Alright, so I need to find the time it takes for her walk when her speed is s + 0.5 km/h, including the coffee shop time t. 

Let me think about how to model this. Since the distance is constant (9 km), the time she spends walking without the coffee break should vary with her speed. But in both scenarios, the total time includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, I can set up equations based on the total time given.

First, let's convert all times to hours because her speed is in km per hour. That might make the calculations easier.

In the first scenario:

- Speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes. 

Wait, but t is in minutes. So I should convert t minutes into hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, the walking time is total time minus t/60 hours. 

Similarly, in the second scenario:

- Speed = s + 2 km/h
- Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.

Again, the walking time is total time minus t/60 hours.

So, let me write down the equations.

For the first scenario:

Walking time = (Total time) - (t / 60) = 4 - (t/60).

But walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed, which is 9 / s hours.

So, equation 1: 9 / s = 4 - (t / 60).

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Walking time = 2.4 - (t / 60).

And walking time is 9 / (s + 2).

So, equation 2: 9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t / 60).

Now, I have two equations:

1. 9 / s = 4 - (t / 60)
2. 9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t / 6
