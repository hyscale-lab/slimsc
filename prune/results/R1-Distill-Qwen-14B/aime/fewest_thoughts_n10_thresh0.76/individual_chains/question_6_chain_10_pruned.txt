Okay, so I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I should probably figure out what the functions f(x) and g(x) look like. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. These are both absolute value functions with some transformations, so their graphs will be V-shaped.

Let me start by sketching or visualizing f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner |x| makes a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). But since it's inside another absolute value, it will reflect any negative parts back up. So, the graph of ||x| - 1/2| will have vertices where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is when |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So, the graph of f(x) will have a V-shape between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, reaching a minimum of 0 at those points, and then it will slope upwards on either side. Beyond x = 1/2 and x = -1/2, it will look like the original |x| shifted up by 1/2. So, for |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, and for |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. The same logic applies. The inner |x| is shifted down by 1/4, then the outer absolute value reflects any negative parts. So, the vertex of g(x) will be at x = 0, but after shifting and reflecting, the points where |x| -1/4 =0 are x=1/4 and x=-1/4. So, between x=-1/4 and x=1/4, g(x) is 1/4 - |x|, and outside that, it's |x| -1/4.

Okay, so now I have an idea of f(x) and g(x). Next, I need to figure out what 4g(f(...)) does. Let me apply the functions step by step.

Starting with f(sin(2πx)). Since sin(2πx) is a sine wave that oscillates between -1 and 1. Let's denote u = sin(2πx). Then f(u) = ||u| - 1/2|. So, for u between -1 and 1, |u| ranges from 0 to 1. So, |u| - 1/2 will range from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value, f(u) will range from 0 to 1/2. So, f(u) is in [0, 1/2].

Then, g(f(u)) = ||f(u)| - 1/4|. Since f(u) is non-negative, |f(u)| is just f(u). So, g(f(u)) = |f(u) - 1/4|. Since f(u) is between 0 and 1/2, f(u) - 1/4 ranges from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking the absolute value, g(f(u)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

Multiply that by 4: 4 * g(f(u)) will take values from 0 to 1. So, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) will vary between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for the other equation, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's see. Let v = cos(3πy). Then, f(v) is ||v| - 1/2|, which as before, ranges from 0 to 1/2. Then, g(f(v)) is |f(v) - 1/4|, which ranges from 0 to 1/4. Multiply by 4, so x = 4 g(f(v)) ranges between 0 and 1.

So, both y and x are between 0 and 1. Now, the problem is to find the number of intersection points between these two curves.

Wait, but actually, the functions are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, each is a function that takes one variable and outputs the other. So, the curves are in the xy-plane, and we need to find how many times they intersect.

This is a bit tricky because both equations are functions but with variables on both sides. So, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the other and find the solutions.

Alternatively, maybe I can analyze the functions' periodicity and behavior to figure out how many intersections there are.

Let me think about the functions step by step.

Starting with y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me see what the function inside does.

First, sin(2πx) has a period of 1, since the period of sin(2πx) is 2π/(2π) = 1. So, sin(2πx) repeats every 1 unit in x.

Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/(3), because cos(k y) has period 2π/k, so 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So, cos(3πy) repeats every 2/3 units in y.

But since both functions are inside multiple absolute value functions and scaled, their periods might be affected. Hmm, not necessarily. Let me think.

But perhaps it's better to consider the entire composite function.

Let me try to understand the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) more carefully.

Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, as I thought before. Then f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let me denote w = |sin(2πx)|, so w is between 0 and 1. So, f(w) is |w - 1/2|. So, for w >=1/2, f(w) = w -1/2, and for w <1/2, f(w) = 1/2 -w.

So, f(w) is a V-shape with vertex at w=1/2.

Then, g(f(w)) = |f(w) - 1/4|. So, since f(w) is between 0 and 1/2, f(w) -1/4 can be negative or positive. So, f(w) -1/4 is between -1/4 and 1/4. Taking absolute value, g(f(w)) is |f(w) -1/4|. So, this will create a V-shape with vertex at f(w)=1/4, which corresponds to w such that f(w)=1/4.

Wait, let's find for which w, f(w)=1/4.

f(w) = |w - 1/2|. So, |w -1/2| =1/4. So, w -1/2=1/4 => w=3/4, or w-1/2=-1/4 => w=1/4. So, when w=1/4 or w=3/4, f(w)=1/4.

So, g(f(w)) = | |w -1/2| -1/4 |.

So
