Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen and the lottery. Let me try to understand what's being asked. 

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They want this probability expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is Jen winning the grand prize, and event B is her winning any prize. Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers correct, which automatically means she has at least two correct, so A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A).

So, the probability we need is P(A)/P(B). 

First, I need to calculate P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. Then, I need to calculate P(B), the probability that she wins at least two numbers. 

Let me start by figuring out how many possible ways there are for the lottery to choose 4 numbers from 10. That should be the combination C(10,4). Similarly, Jen is picking 4 numbers, so her choice is a specific combination of 4 numbers. 

For the grand prize, the probability P(A) is the probability that the 4 numbers chosen by the lottery match Jen's 4 numbers. Since there are C(10,4) possible combinations, and only one of them is Jen's, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, let me compute that. C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, onto P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, she could have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers matching. Since we've already considered the case of exactly 4 (which is the grand prize), we can compute the probability of exactly 2 and exactly 3 and add them all together.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of winning at least two is winning 0 or 1. So, P(B) = 1 - P(0 or 1). Maybe that's easier.

Let me try both methods to make sure I get the same answer.

First, let's compute the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that exactly k of them are in Jen's set of 4. 

Let me denote that as C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because she has 4 numbers correct, and the remaining (4 - k) must come from the numbers she didn't pick, which are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers.

Wait, hold on. Actually, the total number of possible 4-number combinations is C(10,4). The number of combinations where exactly k numbers match Jen's is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because you choose k from Jen's 4, and the remaining (4 - k) from the other 6 numbers.

So, for k=0, it's C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1 * 15 =15.

For k=1, it's C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4 * 20=80.

For k=2, it's C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6 * 15=90.

For k=3, it's C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4 *6=24.

For k=4, it's C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1 *1=1.

Let me check that these add up to C(10,4). 15 +80=95, 95+90=185, 185+24=209, 209+1=210. Yes, that adds up.

So, the number of ways to win a prize is the number of ways to have k=2,3,4. So that's 90 +24 +1=115.

Wait, no. Wait, if k=2,3,4, then the counts are 90,24,1, which sum to 115. But C(10,4)=210, so P(B)=
