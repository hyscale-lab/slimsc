Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on hyperbola properties, but I'll take it slow.

The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, first, I should recall that the standard form of a hyperbola is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, which opens left and right. So in this case, a² is 20, meaning a = sqrt(20) which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5), and b² is 24, so b is 2*sqrt(6). 

The foci of a hyperbola are located at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². Let me calculate that: c² = 20 + 24 = 44, so c = sqrt(44) = 2*sqrt(11). So, the foci are at (±2√11, 0). Not sure if that's immediately useful, but maybe later.

Now, the problem says that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at the origin, meaning the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other. Since the origin is the midpoint, if A is (x, y), then C should be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v).

But wait, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. So, each of these points must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Similarly for B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1, and same for C and D.

Since the figure is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. Hmm, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily equal, but they bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, not necessarily right angles unless it's a square. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't perpendicular unless it's a square. But in this case, it's just a rhombus, so diagonals can be of any angle.

Wait, but in the hyperbola, the diagonals of the rhombus are the axes? Or not necessarily? Because the rhombus is inscribed on the hyperbola, so probably not. The diagonals intersect at the origin, but the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin, so that makes sense.

Now, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD². But wait, no, it's the supremum? Wait
