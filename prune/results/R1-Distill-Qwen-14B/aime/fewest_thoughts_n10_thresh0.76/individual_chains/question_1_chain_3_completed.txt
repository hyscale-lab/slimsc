Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
This means 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, sqrt(2) = x / (y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)  --> (1a)

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
So, 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)  --> (2a)

Third equation:
log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4
Which means 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)  --> (3a)

Now, I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) that relate x, y, z. My goal is to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me denote that expression as E for simplicity.

E = log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of logarithms. Let me define:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

So, E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Now, I need to find a, b, c.

Looking back at the three original equations, let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation (1a, 2a, 3a) because logarithms can help linearize the multiplicative relationships.

Starting with equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)
Taking log₂ of both sides:
log₂ x = log₂ (y z sqrt(2)) = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2)
Which simplifies to:
a = b + c + (1/2)   --> because log₂ sqrt(2) is log₂ 2^(1/2) = 1/2

Similarly, equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)
Taking log₂:
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + log₂ 2^(1/3)
Which simplifies to:
b = a + c + (1/3)

Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)
Taking log₂:
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + log₂ 2^(1/4)
Which simplifies to:
c = a + b + (1/4)

So now I have a system of three equations with a, b, c:
1. a = b + c + 1/2   --> Equation (1b)
2. b = a + c + 1/3   --> Equation (2b)
3. c = a + b + 1/4   --> Equation (3b)

Hmm, this is a linear system. Let me write them down clearly:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

I can try to solve for a, b, c using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2 --> Let's substitute a in equations (2b) and (3b).

Substituting a into equation (2b):
b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
Simplify:
b = b + c + 1/2 + c + 1/3
b = b + 2c + 5/6  (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6)

Subtract b from both sides:
0 = 2c + 5/6
So, 2c = -5/6
c = -5/12

Wait, c is log₂ z, and since z is a positive real number, c can be negative. That's fine.

Now, from equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
We can write a = b + (-5/12) + 1/2
Which is a = b - 5/12 + 6/12 = b + 1/12

So, a = b + 1/12 --> Equation (4)

Now, let's substitute a into equation (3b):
c = a + b + 1/4
We know c = -5/12, so:
-5/12 = a + b + 1/4

But from equation (4): a = b + 1/12, substitute into above:

-5/12 = (b + 1/12) + b + 1/4
Simplify:
-5/12 = 2b + 1/12 + 3/12 (since 1/4 is 3/12)
Wait, 1/4 is 3/12, so:

-5/12 = 2b + (1/12 + 3/12) = 2b + 4/12 = 2b + 1/3

So, 2b = -5/12 - 4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4

Thus, b = (-3/4) / 2 = -3/8

Now, from equation (4): a = b + 1/12 = (-3/8) + 1/12

To add these, find a common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24
1/12 = 2/24
So, a = (-9 + 2)/24 = (-7)/24

So, a = -7/24

So now, a = log₂ x = -7/24
b = log₂ y = -3/8
c = log₂ z = -5/12

Now, let's compute E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Plugging in the values:

E = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Calculate each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6

3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8

2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

So, E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

First, combine (-7/6) and (-5/6):

(-7/6 -5/6) = (-12/6) = -2

So now, E = -2 + (-9/8) = (-16/8 - 9/8) = (-25/8)

But the problem asks for the absolute value of E, so |E| = | -25/8 | = 25/8

25 and 8 are coprime since their GCD is 1. So, m =25, n=8, m +n=33.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Starting with the three logarithmic equations:

1. a = b + c + 1/2
2. b = a + c + 1/3
3. c = a + b + 1/4

Solving:

From equation 1: a = b + c + 1/2
From equation 2: b = a + c + 1/3
From equation 3: c = a + b + 1/4

Substituting a from equation 1 into equation 2:

b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
=> b = b + 2c + 5/6
Subtract b: 0 = 2c +5/6 => c= -5/12

Then from equation 1: a = b + (-5/12) +1/2 = b -5/12 +6/12 = b +1/12

Substituting a into equation 3:

c = (b + 1/12) + b +1/4
=> c = 2b +1/12 +3/12 = 2b +4/12 =2b +1/3
But c is -5/12, so:

-5/12=2b +1/3
Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:

-5=24b +4
=> 24b = -9
=> b= -9/24= -3/8

Then from equation 1: a= (-3/8) + (-5/12) +1/2

Wait, perhaps I should recompute a here:

Wait, equation 1 is a = b + c +1/2. So,

a = (-3/8) + (-5/12) + 1/2

Compute each term:

Convert to 24 denominator:

-3/8 = -9/24

-5/12 = -10/24

1/2 = 12/24

So, a = (-9/24) + (-10/24) +12/24 = (-19 +12)/24 = (-7)/24

Which matches earlier.

Now, E =4a +3b +2c:

a= -7/24, b=-3/8, c=-5/12

4a=4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6

3b=3*(-3/8)= -9/8

2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6

Adding them:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-12/6)= -2

Then, -2 -9/8 = (-16/8 -9/8)= -25/8

Absolute value is 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8, m +n=33.

I think that's correct. I don't see any calculation errors now.


Alright, let's break down the solution step by step.

We start with the given logarithmic equations:
1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We rewrite each equation in exponential form:
1. \(2^{1/2} = \frac{x}{yz} \implies x = yz\sqrt{2}\)
2. \(2^{1/3} = \frac{y}{xz} \implies y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(2^{1/4} = \frac{z}{xy} \implies z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Next, we take the logarithm base 2 of each equation to linearize the relationships:
1. \(\log_2 x = \log_2 y + \log_2 z + \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2 y = \log_2 x + \log_2 z + \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2 z = \log_2 x + \log_2 y + \frac{1}{4}\)

Let \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). The system becomes:
1. \(a = b + c + \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(b = a + c + \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(c = a + b + \frac{1}{4}\)

Solving this linear system:
- From equation 2: \(b = a + c + \frac{1}{3}\)
- Substitute \(a\) from equation 1 into equation 2 to find \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\).
- Substitute \(c\) back into equation 1 to find \(a = b + \frac{1}{12}\).
- Substitute \(a\) into equation 3 to solve for \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\).
- Finally, \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\).

Now, compute \(E = 4a + 3b + 2c\):
\[
E = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]
Taking the absolute value, \(|E| = \frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
