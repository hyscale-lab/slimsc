Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to understand what's going on. 

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is a given. Then, they also own other things: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

Wait, but each person owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are like a common thing everyone has, and the others are additional. So, in terms of sets, I can think of four sets: C (candy hearts), D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), and S (garden spade). But since everyone has C, maybe I don't need to consider it separately? Or perhaps I should include it in the Venn diagram.

The problem also mentions that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. I need to find the number who own all four. Hmm.

Wait, so let me rephrase: The universal set is 900 people. Each person owns at least the candy hearts, and may own 0, 1, 2, 3, or all four of the other items. But no, wait, candy hearts are a given, so each person has at least one itemâ€”candy hearts. So, the other items are optional. But the problem talks about owning diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. So, maybe the four things are treated as separate, but candy hearts are always there.

Wait, maybe the problem is structured as four sets: C, D, G, S. But since everyone has C, perhaps C is the universal set, and the other three are subsets of C. So, D is a subset of C, G is a subset of C, and S is a subset of C.

But the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, yes, the total is 900, and everyone has C. Then, the rest can have any combination of D, G, S.

Wait, but the problem states 195 own a diamond ring,
