Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations given are a bit complicated, but I'll try to break them down step by step.

The first function is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Both of these involve compositions of functions f and g, which are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So, I need to understand what these functions look like and how they behave.

Let me first analyze function f(x). Since f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, it's a double absolute value function. The inner part, |x|, is a V-shaped graph with a vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 gives us |x| - 1/2, which shifts the graph down by 1/2. Then taking the absolute value of that will reflect any negative parts back up. So f(x) will have a V-shape but with its vertex at where |x| - 1/2 equals zero. Solving |x| - 1/2 = 0, we get x = ±1/2. So, f(x) will have a V-shape with vertices at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), but since we're dealing with absolute value, it's symmetric. So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, and for x outside that interval, f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Following the same logic, the inner |x| is shifted down by 1/4, and then the absolute value reflects the negative parts. So g(x) will have vertices where |x| - 1/4 = 0, which is at x = ±1/4. So, for |x| ≤ 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, and for |x| > 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.

Now, both functions f and g are applied inside each other in the given equations. Let me consider f(sin(2πx)) first.

The function sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, oscillating between -1 and 1. Then f is applied to this. So f(sin(2πx)) will take each value of sin(2πx), compute its absolute value, subtract 1/2, and take the absolute value again.

Wait, let me think. Since f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, when we plug sin(2πx) into f, it becomes f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Similarly for g.

So, let's consider the range of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy). Both functions will oscillate between -1 and 1, so their absolute values will be between 0 and 1.

Given that, let's figure out what f(sin(2πx)) looks like.

Let me denote z = sin(2πx). Then f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|. Since z is between -1 and 1, |z| is between 0 and 1. So, when |z| >= 1/2, |z| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(z) = |z| - 1/2. When |z| < 1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - |z|.

So, f(z) is a V-shaped function with minima at |z|=1/2, where f(z)=0, and peaks at |z|=0, where f(z)=1/2.

Similarly, g(f(z)) is computed next. Since f(z) is between 0 and 1/2 (since |z| ≤1, so |z| -1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2, but then we take absolute value, so f(z) is between 0 and 1/2). So, g(w) where w = f(z) is ||w| - 1/4|. But since w is between 0 and 1/2, |w| is w, so g(w) = |w - 1/4|.

Because w is between 0 and 1/2, w - 1/4 can be negative or positive. When w < 1/4, w - 1/4 is negative, so g(w) = 1/4 - w. When w >= 1/4, g(w) = w - 1/4. So, the graph of g(w) is a V-shape with a vertex at w = 1/4, where g(w)=0.

So, putting it all together, 4g(f(z)) will scale the output by 4.

Let me try to sketch the behavior.

First, for f(z):

- When sin(2πx) is 0, f(z) = 1/2.
- When sin(2πx) is 1 or -1, f(z) = 0.
- And it's symmetric around multiples of 0.5 in the sine function.

But wait, sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1, so from x=0 to x=1, it completes a full cycle.

So, f(sin(2πx)) is going to have a diamond shape for each period, reaching up to 1/2 at the midpoints (x=0.25, 0.75, etc.) and down to 0 at x=0, 0.5, 1, etc.

Wait, let's see: When sin(2πx) is 0, which occurs at x=0, 0.5, 1, etc., then f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

When sin(2πx) is 1 or -1, which occurs at x=0.2
