Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. Then, express that probability as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each colored red or blue. Each color has a 50% chance, so each vertex is an independent event with P(red) = 1/2 and P(blue) = 1/2.

The problem is about rotation. So, we're looking for colorings where there's some rotation (by 0°, 45°, 90°, etc.) that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. Wait, actually, the wording says that after rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, this means that if we rotate the octagon, every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. In other words, the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Alternatively, the blue set is a shifted version of the red set under some rotation. So, for a given rotation, if we rotate the octagon by k positions (where k is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7), the set of blue vertices should exactly match the set of red vertices under that rotation.

Wait, but the octagon can be rotated in steps of 45°, which corresponds to shifting the vertices by 1, 2, 3, etc., positions. So, for each possible rotation, we can check if the blue set is a shifted version of the red set.

But actually, the problem is asking for the existence of any rotation that does this. So, perhaps it's equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices. So, the colorings where the blue and red sets are rotationally congruent.

Alternatively, maybe it's saying that the blue set is a permutation of the red set by rotation. So, the question is whether the blue vertices can be obtained by rotating the red vertices by some number of steps.

So, for a given coloring, we count the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256, since each vertex has two color choices.

So, the probability is the number of colorings where such a rotation exists, divided by 256.

So, to find the number of such colorings, we can think about the possible rotational symmetries. A regular octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning rotations by multiples of 45° (i.e., 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°). So, each rotation corresponds to shifting the octagon by 0,1,2,...,7 positions.

So, for each possible rotation k (from 0 to 7), we can consider colorings where the blue set is the red set shifted by
