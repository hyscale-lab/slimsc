Okay, so I have this problem where each vertex of a regular octagon is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue independently with equal probability. So, each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red or blue, and the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the problem is about the probability that after some rotation, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, this is about some kind of permutation of the vertices due to rotation, and the colorings needing to satisfy a certain condition.

I think the key here is to understand the concept of a rotation mapping blue vertices to red ones. So, if we rotate the octagon by k positions (where k can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 7), the color of each vertex at position i will move to position (i + k) mod 8.

For the condition to be satisfied, after some rotation k, every blue vertex must be mapped to a red vertex. That is, for each blue vertex at position i, the vertex at position (i - k) mod 8 must have been red. So, the coloring must be such that there's a rotation k where all the blue vertices are at positions that were originally red.

Alternatively, this is equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the red vertices under some rotation. Wait, but since rotations are permutations, it's more precise to say that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, no, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again. If we have a coloring C, and a rotation by k, then C rotated by k should have blue vertices where C had red vertices. So, the blue set after rotation should equal the red set before rotation? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, actually, the condition is that after rotation, all
