Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be represented in polar form as \( z = re^{i\theta} \), where \( r \) is the modulus and \( \theta \) is the argument. Since \( |z| = 4 \), that means \( r = 4 \). So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). That might make things easier because working with exponentials can sometimes simplify multiplication and division.

Let me rewrite the expression using \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). So, the first term is \( (75 + 117i)z \), which becomes \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). The second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \), which becomes \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \). Simplifying both terms:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So, the entire expression becomes:

\( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Hmm, maybe I can combine these terms or simplify them more. Alternatively, since I'm dealing with exponentials, perhaps I can express everything in terms of cosine and sine for easier manipulation.

Let me recall that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). So, maybe substituting these in will help.

Let me denote the first complex number \( A = 75 + 117i \) and the second complex number \( B = 96 + 144i \). So, the expression becomes:

\( 4A e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}B e^{-i\theta} \).

Expressing \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \):

\( 4A (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + \frac{1}{4}B (\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Now, let me compute each part separately. Let's compute \( 4A \) and \( \frac{1}{4}B \):

First, \( 4A = 4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i \).

Second, \( \frac{1}{4}B = \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i) = 24 + 36i \).

So, substituting back:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Now, I'll expand each product.

Starting with the first product:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \).

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:

\( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \).

Similarly, the second product:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \).

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:

\( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \).

Now, let me group the real and imaginary parts for both expansions.

First expansion (from the first product):

Real parts: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \).

Imaginary parts: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \) multiplied by \( i \).

Second expansion (from the second product):

Real parts: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \).

Imaginary parts: \( (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) \) multiplied by \( i \).

Now, adding both expansions together:

Total real part: \( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) \).

Simplify:

Combine \( \cos\theta \) terms: \( 300 + 24 = 324 \), so \( 324\cos\theta \).

Combine \( \sin\theta \) terms: \( -468 + 36 = -432 \), so \( -432\sin\theta \).

So total real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Similarly, total imaginary part: \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) \).

Wait, but in the second expansion, the imaginary part is \( (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) \), right? Because it's \( -24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta \), so when we add, it becomes:

First, from the first product: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \).

From the second product: \( -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \).

So, adding these:

Imaginary part: \( (300\sin\theta -24\sin\theta) + (468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta) \).

Which is \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \).

So, the entire expression is:

\( [324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta] + i[276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta] \).

But the original problem asks for the largest possible real part of this expression. So, the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

We need to find the maximum value of this real part as \( \theta \) varies.

Hmm, that seems manageable. So, the real part is a function of \( \theta \): \( R(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

I remember that expressions of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \) or something like that. Wait, actually, the exact formula is \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{
