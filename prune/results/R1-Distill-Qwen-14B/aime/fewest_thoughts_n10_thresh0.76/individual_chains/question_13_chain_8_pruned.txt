Okay, so I've got this problem here about Aya's walking and coffee shop time. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

So, every morning Aya walks 9 kilometers. She goes at a constant speed, s km per hour, and her walk takes 4 hours including t minutes at the coffee shop. Then, when she walks a bit faster, at s+2 km/h, her walk time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same t minutes.

The question is asking, if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how many minutes will the walk take her, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm. So I think the key is to find s and t first, right? Because once I have those, I can compute the time for the new speed.

Let's start by writing down the information given.

First scenario:
- Distance: 9 km
- Speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours (which is 240 minutes) including t minutes at the coffee shop.

Wait, but the walking time without the coffee shop would be total time minus t. So walking time is (240 - t) minutes. But we might want to convert everything into hours to keep the units consistent.

So, 4 hours is the total time, so walking time is (4 - t/60) hours, since t is in minutes. Because 1 hour is 60 minutes, so t minutes is t/60 hours.

Similarly, the second scenario:

- Distance: 9 km
- Speed: s + 2 km/h
- Total time: 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.

So walking time is (2.4 - t/60) hours.

Wait, but the walking time can also be calculated by distance divided by speed. So:

In the first case, walking time is 9 / s hours. But that equals (4 - t/60) hours.

Similarly, in the second case, walking time is 9 / (s + 2) hours, which equals (2.4 - t/60) hours.

So I can set up two equations:

1) 9 / s = 4 - t/60
2) 9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

Hmm, so that's two equations with two unknowns, s and t. I can solve these equations to find s and t.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Equation 2: 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

So, if I subtract equation 1 from equation 2, maybe I can eliminate t? Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Alternatively, I can express t from equation 1 and plug into equation 2.

Let me try that.

From equation 1:

t/60 = 4 - (9/s)

So, t = 60*(4 -
