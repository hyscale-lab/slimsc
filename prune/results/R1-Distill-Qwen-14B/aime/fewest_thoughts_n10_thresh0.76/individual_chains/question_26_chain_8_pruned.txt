Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We are given the sides AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. We need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize everything. But since I don't have paper right now, I'll try to imagine it. So, triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents at B and C intersect at D, so D is the ex-pole with respect to triangle ABC. Hmm.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, those two tangent segments are equal. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. That might come in handy later.

Now, AD intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is a secant from A passing through P on the circle. I think we can use power of a point here. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² (since DB is a tangent) and also equal to DC², but since DB = DC, that checks out.

So, power of point D: DB² = DC² = DP × DA. Wait, no. Wait, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC², and AD is a secant that starts at D, passes through A, and intersects ω at P. So, the power formula would be DB² = DP × DA. Wait, but A is outside the circle? No, A is on the circle, right? Because ABC is inscribed in ω. So, point A is on ω, so DA is a secant from D passing through A and P.

Wait, but D is outside the circle, so power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP × DA.

Wait, but A is on the circle, so DA is a secant that starts at D, passes through A, and intersects the circle again at P. So, yes, the power of D is DP × DA = DB².

So, if I can find DB, then I can set up the equation DP × DA = DB², which would let me solve for DP, and then find AP since AP = AD - DP.

But wait, do I know DA? Hmm, maybe not directly. So perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use harmonic division or something related to poles and polars. Alternatively, maybe use inversion, but that might be too complicated.

Wait, let's think about coordinates. Maybe coordinate geometry could work here. Let me try that.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, AC is 10 units, so point A can be at (10, 0). Point B is somewhere in the plane. Given that AB = 5 and BC = 9, I can find the coordinates of B.

So, point C is (0,0), point A is (10,0). Point B is (x,y) such that distance from B to A is 5, and from B to C is 9.

So, distance from B to C: √(x² + y²) = 9 ⇒ x² + y² = 81.

Distance from B to A: √((x - 10)^2 + y²) = 5 ⇒ (x -10)^2 + y² = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (x -10)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81 ⇒ (x² -20x +100) + y² -x² - y² = -56 ⇒ -20x +100 = -56 ⇒ -20x = -156 ⇒ x = 156 / 20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

Then, from x² + y² =81, x=39/5, so x² = (39/5)^2 = 1521/25. Then, y² = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25. So y = ±√(504/25) = ±(√504)/5. Simplify √504: 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, no. Let me compute 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not an integer. Let me factor 504: 504= 16*31.5 isn't right. Wait, 504= 8*63=8*9*7=2^3 * 3^2 *7. So, √504=√(16*31.5)= wait, no, that's not helpful. Wait, √(2^3 *3^2 *7)= 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7)= 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)= 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let me check: 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9. So, √(8*9*7)= √(504). So, √(8*9*7)=√(72*7)=√(504)= √(36*14)=6√14. Oh, right! Because 36*14=504. So, y= ±6√14 /5. So, point B is at (7.8, (6√14)/5) or (7.8, -(6√14)/5). Since the triangle is drawn with point B above the x-axis (as per the Asymptote code), I think y is positive. So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So now, points are:

A: (10, 0)

B: (39/5, 6√14/5)

C: (0, 0)

Next step: find the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω. Wait, but the tangent at C is the line perpendicular to the radius OC, where O is the center of the circle. But since we've placed C at (0,0), if we can find the center O, we can find the tangent at C.

Wait, alternatively, since the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, for point B, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and similarly for C.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the equation of the tangent lines.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the equation of the tangent at B and at C, then find their intersection point D.

First, I need to find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

To find the circumcircle, I can find the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and find their intersection point O.

Let me compute the perpendicular bisector of AC and AB.

Wait, AC is from (10,0) to (0,0), so the midpoint is (5,0). The slope of AC is (0-0)/(0-10)=0, so it's horizontal. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, x=5.

Now, find the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Point A is (10,0), point B is (39/5, 6√14/5). Let's compute
