Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which gives (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

When the problem mentions that the sides of the rectangle lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, it implies that the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle is a line connecting two vertices of the dodecagon, which could be a side (adjacent vertices) or a diagonal (non-adjacent vertices).

To form a rectangle, we need four such chords that form four right angles. So, the key idea is that in a regular dodecagon, certain pairs of parallel chords can intersect each other at right angles, forming rectangles. Wait, but in a regular polygon, are the diagonals necessarily perpendicular? Hmm, I don't think so. So, maybe the sides of the rectangle are formed by two pairs of parallel chords that intersect each other at right angles.

But how exactly does this work? Maybe I should think about the symmetries and properties of the regular dodecagon. Since it's regular, it's symmetric, and all sides and angles are equal. So, the number of rectangles should be related to the number of such symmetric configurations.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to consider the dodecagon inscribed in a circle. Each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference, so the central angle between any two adjacent vertices is 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). That might help in figuring out the lengths of the chords (sides and diagonals) and their angles relative to each other.

I remember that in a regular polygon, the length of a chord depends on the number of sides it skips. For example, in a dodecagon, the side length is the chord that connects two adjacent vertices (skipping 0 sides), and the next diagonal skips 1 vertex, then 2, and so on. So, in a dodecagon, each vertex can be connected to 10 other vertices (excluding itself and its immediate neighbor on one side), but since each chord is counted twice, the number of unique chords is 12*10/2 = 60, but that includes sides and diagonals.

Wait, but for rectangles, I don't need all these chords. I need pairs of parallel chords that are perpendicular to each other. So, perhaps I should find all possible pairs of such chords.

But how to model this? Maybe I should think in terms of vectors. Each chord can be represented as a vector from one vertex to another. For two vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. But in a regular polygon, the vectors have specific angles relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider the coordinates of the vertices. If I place the regular dodecagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin, each vertex can be represented as (cos(theta), sin(theta)), where theta is an angle multiple of 30 degrees (since 360/12=30). So, the vertices are at angles 0째, 30째, 60째, ..., up to 330째.

If I can represent each chord as a vector between two points, then two chords are perpendicular if the angle between them is 90 degrees. But wait, that's not exactly right because the chords could be in any orientation, not necessarily from the origin. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Let me think differently. In a regular polygon, two chords are perpendicular if the difference in their step sizes (number of vertices they skip)
