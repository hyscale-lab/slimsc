Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. I need to figure out what makes a number b-eautiful and then determine the smallest base where this happens.

Let me start by understanding the definition. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n is a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, I need to formalize this. Let's think about how a two-digit number in base b works. In base b, a two-digit number is written as "ab" where a is the first digit (the "tens" place in base 10) and b is the second digit (the "units" place). But in general base b, the value of "ab" in base b is a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b, meaning they must satisfy 0 ≤ a, c < b. However, since it's a two-digit number, a cannot be zero (otherwise, it would be a single-digit number). So, a ranges from 1 to b-1, and c ranges from 0 to b-1.

Given that, the number n can be expressed as n = a*b + c, where a is in [1, b-1], c is in [0, b-1]. The sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum must equal sqrt(n). So, the equation we have is:

a + c = sqrt(n) = sqrt(a*b + c)

So, our equation is:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange terms to bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, let me group similar terms:

a^2 - a*b + (2*a*c - c) + c^2 = 0

Wait, maybe it's better to factor terms:

Looking at the equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a b - c = 0

I can write it as:

(a^2 - a b) + (2ac - c) + c^2 = 0

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor out terms with a and c:

= a^2 + (2c - b)*a + c^2 - c = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a, but perhaps we can treat it as a quadratic in a variable. Alternatively, maybe it's better to let s = a + c and express n in terms of s.

Wait, since s = a + c, and n = a*b + c, let's express n in terms of s.

We have n = a*b + c.

But s = a + c, which can be rewritten as c = s - a.

Substituting c into n:

n = a*b + (s - a) = a*b + s - a = a*(b - 1) + s

So, n = a*(b - 1) + s.

But we also know that s = sqrt(n), so n = s^2.

Therefore:

s^2 = a*(b - 1) + s

Rearranged:

a*(b - 1) = s^2 - s

Which gives:

a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since a must be an integer (as it's a digit in base b), (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (s^2 - s) mod (b - 1) must be zero.

Additionally, since a is a digit in base b, 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1. Similarly, c = s - a must also satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1. So, c = s - a ≥ 0 => a ≤ s, and c = s - a < b => a > s - (b - 1). So, a must be in [max(1, s - (b - 1) + 1), min(b - 1, s)].

Wait, let me think again. Since c = s - a must be ≤ b - 1, so s - a ≤ b - 1 => a ≥ s - (b - 1). But since a is at least 1, the lower bound is max(1, s - (b - 1) + 1). Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, c = s - a must be ≤ b - 1. So:

s - a ≤ b - 1 => a ≥ s - (b - 1).

Similarly, since c = s - a ≥ 0:

s - a ≥ 0 => a ≤ s.

So, a must satisfy:

s - (b - 1) ≤ a ≤ s
