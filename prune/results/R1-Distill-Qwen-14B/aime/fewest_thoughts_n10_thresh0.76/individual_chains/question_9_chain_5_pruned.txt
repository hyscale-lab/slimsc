Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that logarithms have some properties that can help simplify these expressions. 

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. I think the logarithm power rule says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that here, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, but log_x(y) is the exponent you raise x to get y. Let me denote that as k, so log_x(y) = k, which means x^k = y.

Then, substituting back into the equation, x * k = 10. So, k = 10 / x. But since k = log_x(y), that means log_x(y) = 10 / x. Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of natural logarithms to make it easier. Remember that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). So, ln(y)/ln(x) = 10 / x. 

Let me write that down as equation (1):
ln(y) = (10 / x) * ln(x)

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, applying the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let me denote log_y(x) as m, so 4y * m = 10. Then, m = 10 / (4y) = 5/(2y). But since m = log_y(x), that means log_y(x) = 5/(2y). 

Expressed in natural logs, that would be ln(x)/ln(y) = 5/(2y). Let's write that as equation (2):
ln(x) = (5/(2y)) * ln(y)

Now, from equation (1), I have ln(y) = (10/x) * ln(x). Let me substitute this into equation (2). So, ln(x) = (5/(2y)) * (10/x) * ln(x). Let's simplify that:

ln(x) = (5/(2y)) * (10/x) * ln(x)
ln(x) = (50)/(2xy) * ln(x)
ln(x) = (25)/(xy) * ln(x)

Wait, that's interesting. So, ln(x) = (25)/(xy) * ln(x). If I subtract (25/(xy)) ln(x) from both sides, I get:

ln(x) - (25/(xy)) ln(x) = 0
ln(x) * [1 - 25/(xy)] = 0

Since x and y are both greater than 1, ln(x) isn't zero. So, the other factor must be zero:

1 - 25/(xy) = 0
25/(xy) = 1
xy = 25

Oh, so the product xy is 25? That seems straightforward once I substituted the equations. Let me just check if this makes sense.

Wait, let me verify by plugging back into the original equations. If xy=25, then y=25/x.

From the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10. Substituting y=25/x, we get log_x((25/x)^x) =10.

Simplify inside the log: (25/x)^x = (25^x)/(x^x) = (25/ x)^x. So, log_x of that is x * log_x(25/x) =10.

Which is x*(log_x(25) - log_x(x)) =10. Since log_x(x)=1, this becomes x*(log_x(25) -1)=10.

But log_x(25) is equal to ln(25)/ln(x). Hmm, maybe I can express this differently. Alternatively, from the first equation, we had ln(y) = (10/x) * ln(x). Since y=25/x, ln(25/x) = (10/x) ln(x).

Calculating ln(25/x) = ln(25) - ln(x). So,

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) ln(x)
Multiply both sides by x:
x ln(25) - x ln(x) = 10 ln(x)
Bring all terms to one side:
x ln(
