Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay.

First off, I know that \( z \) is a complex number, and it's given that its magnitude is 4. So, \( |z| = 4 \). That means \( z \) can be represented in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \), right? So, in polar form, \( z \) is 4 multiplied by \( e \) raised to some imaginary power. That might make things easier because dealing with exponents could simplify the expression later.

The expression we need to maximize is:
\[ (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \]

Let me write this down again to make sure I have it correctly:
\[ (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \]

Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can express \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) as \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \), because \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} \), and since \( |z| = 4 \), this becomes \( \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). But in polar form, this would just be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, we get:

First part: \( (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\theta} \)
Second part: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \) which simplifies to \( (96 + 144i) * \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \)

Let me compute both parts separately.

Starting with the first part:
\( (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\theta} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\theta} \)
Let me compute \( 4*(75 + 117i) \):
4*75 = 300
4*117 = 468
So, the first part becomes \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \)

Now the second part:
\( (96 + 144i) * \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

So putting it all together, the entire expression is:
\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

Now, let's express each term using Euler's formula. Remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, expanding the first term:
\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Multiply this out:
= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta
= 300\cos\theta + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i - 468\sin\theta (since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Similarly, expanding the second term:
\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
Multiply this out:
= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta
= 24\cos\theta + (36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i + 36\sin\theta (since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Now, let's combine both expansions. Let me write them as real and imaginary parts.

First term's real part: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
First term's imaginary part: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i

Second term's real part: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
Second term's imaginary part: (36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i

Adding the real parts together:
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
= (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta
= 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta

Adding the imaginary parts together:
(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i
= (300\sin\theta - 24\sin\theta) + (468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta)
= 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta
So, the imaginary part is (276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i

But the original problem asks for the largest possible real part of the entire expression. So, we only need to focus on the real part, which is 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

So, our goal is to maximize the real part \( Re = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Hmm, okay. This is a function of \( \theta \), and we need to find its maximum value.

I remember that expressions of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi \) is some angle. The maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), and it occurs when \( \cos(\theta + \phi) = 1 \), i.e., when \( \theta = -\phi \).

Alternatively, another way is to realize that the maximum value is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). So, let me compute that.

Wait, but in our case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

So, \( a = 324 \), \( b = -432 \).

So, the maximum value is \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared and 432 squared.

324^2: Let's compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and then 2*300*24=14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 90000+14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160000, 32^2=1024, 2*400*32=25600. So, (400+32)^2=400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2=160000 + 25600 + 1024=160000+25600=185600 +1024=186,624.

So, the squares are 104,976 and 186,624.

Adding them together: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So, square root of 291,600.

Hmm, what is sqrt(291600)?

Well, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, (500+40)^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So, sqrt(291,600) = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.

So, the real part is \( Re = 324\cos\theta -43
