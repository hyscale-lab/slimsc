Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen 4. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. So, we're given that she won a prize, and we need to find the probability that it's the grand prize.

This sounds like a conditional probability problem. So, I remember that the conditional probability formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event that she wins the grand prize, and B is the event that she wins a prize. But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize because having all four numbers certainly means she has at least two. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) would be P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A), the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen, and P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. Then, divide them to get the conditional probability.

Let me first find the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 elements, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). I can compute that as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, total possible combinations are 210.

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. There's only one way for this to happen: all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. Since Jen picks 4 specific numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to compute P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. "At least two" means two, three, or four of her numbers are chosen. So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four of her numbers being chosen.

Calculating each part:

1. Exactly four: As before, this is 1 case, so probability is 1/210.

2. Exactly three: This means three of her four numbers are chosen, and one is not. The number of ways to choose three of her four numbers is C(4,3) = 4. Then, the remaining one number is chosen from the other 6 numbers not in her set. So, the number of favorable combinations is 4 * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24. Therefore, the probability is 24 / 210.

3. Exactly two: Similarly, two of her four numbers are chosen, and two are from the other six. The number of ways to choose two from her four is C(4,2) = 6. The number of ways to choose two from the other six is C(6,2) = 15. So, the number of favorable combinations is 6 * 15 = 90. The probability is 90 / 210.

Now, adding all these up: 1 + 24 + 90 = 115. So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me double-check that. 1 (for four) + 24 (for three) + 90 (for two) is indeed 115. And the total possible combinations are 210, so 115/210 is correct.

Simplify 115/210: Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 ÷5 =23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on, 23 and 42 share a common divisor? 23 is prime, 42 is 2*3*7. No, they don't share any common factors, so 23/42 is reduced.

Similarly, P(A) is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210, so the ratio is 1/115. Hmm, that seems correct.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the number of favorable cases for exactly two, three, and four.

For exactly four, it's 1 case. Correct.

For exactly three: C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24. So, 24 cases.

For exactly two: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90. So, 90 cases.

Total is 1 +24 +90=115. So, P(B) is 115/210, which is 23/42. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, the conditional probability is (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, because 115 is 5*23, and 1 is coprime with everything. So, m + n is 1 + 115 =116.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. Is there another way to compute this?

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a hypergeometric distribution problem. Because we're dealing with successes and failures without replacement.

In hypergeometric terms, the population size N is 1
