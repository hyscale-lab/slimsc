Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of two equations: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f and g are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Hmm, that's a lot of nested functions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I think I should understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. They're both absolute value functions with some transformations. Let's start with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. 

The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape graph with its vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 inside the absolute value gives us | |x| - 1/2 |. So, this is another transformation. Let me think about how this affects the graph.

When you have |x| - a inside an absolute value, it creates a V-shape again but shifted. Specifically, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| will have vertices where |x| - 1/2 is zero, which is at |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So, the graph of f(x) will have V-shapes at these points.

Wait, actually, when you take | |x| - a |, the graph will have a W-shape if a is positive because it reflects the parts that go below zero. So for f(x), the standard V becomes a W with minima at x = ±1/2 and the vertex at x=0, y=1/2. Let me confirm that. Let's test some points:

At x=0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.
At x=1/2: f(1/2) = | |1/2| - 1/2 | = |0| = 0.
At x=1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.
At x=3/4: f(3/4) = |3/4 - 1/2| = 1/4.
So yes, the graph of f(x) is a W with minima at x = ±1/2, y=0 and maxima at x=0, y=1/2, and symmetric about the y-axis.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that. At x=0, g(x) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4. At x=1/4, g(x) is zero. At x=1/2, g(x) = |1/2 -1/4| = 1/4. At x=3/4, g(x) = |3/4 -1/4|=1/2. So, the graph of g(x) is a W-shape as well, but with minima at x=±1/4, y=0, and maxima at x=0, y=1/4, and symmetric about the y-axis.

Now, the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) involve these f and g functions applied to sine and cosine functions, respectively. Let me first understand the structure of these composite functions.

Starting with the first function: 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break it down.

First, compute sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1 because 2πx completes a cycle every x=1. So sin(2πx) is a wave that oscillates between -1 and 1, with period 1. Then, we apply f to it: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1.

So, | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | will have the same W-shape as f(x), but with the input being |sin(2πx)|. Let's see what the range of f(sin(2πx)) is.

Since |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| will range from 0 to 1/2. Because when |sin(2πx)| is 1/2, f is 0, and when |sin(2πx)| is 0 or 1, f is 1/2. So the output of f(sin(...)) is between 0 and 1/2.

Then, we apply g to this result: g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|. But since f(sin(...)) is between 0 and 1/2, which is non-negative, we can drop the absolute value: ||f(...) - 1/4|.

So g(f(...)) ranges from:

When f(...) is 1/4, g(...) is 0.

When f(...) is 0, g(...) is 1/4.

When f(...) is 1/2, g(...) is |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4.

So the range of g(f(sin(...))) is from 0 to 1/4.

Then, multiplying by 4: 4 * g(...) will scale this range from 0 to 1.

So, 4g(f(sin(2πx))) ranges from 0 to 1.

So, the first equation y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function y that oscillates between 0 and 1, with a period that's related to the sine function's period.

But wait, the inner function is sin(2πx), which has period 1. So the entire function y is periodic with period 1.

Similarly, for the second equation: x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's analyze that.

Again, starting with cos(3πy). The cosine function has a period of 2π/(3π) )= 2/3. So, cos(3πy) completes a cycle every y=2/3. The value ranges between -1 and 1.

Then, f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. So similar to before, this will be a W-shaped function, but with |cos(3πy)| as input. Since |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, f will output between 0 and 1/2.

Then, g(f(...)) is ||f(...) - 1/4|, but since f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, this is equivalent to |f(...) - 1/4|, so the range is from 0 to 1/4.

Multiplying by 4 gives x = 4g(f(...)) which ranges from 0 to 1.

So, the second equation x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is a function x that oscillates between 0 and 1, with a period related to the cosine function. Since cos(3πy) has period 2/3, but since it's inside f and g, which are both even functions, the period might be different. Hmm, perhaps the period is 1/3, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

Wait, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3. But when we take |cos(3πy)|, the period is
