Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided shape with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, I think. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on either the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon. So, I need to figure out all possible rectangles that can be formed by connecting these sides and diagonals.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting pairs of vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center. For example, in a regular hexagon (6 sides), you can form rectangles by connecting every other vertex. Wait, but a hexagon only has three pairs of opposite sides, so maybe that's different.

Wait, but a dodecagon has 12 sides, which is more, so maybe there are more possibilities for rectangles here.

I think the key here is to recognize that any rectangle inscribed in the dodecagon must have its sides parallel to pairs of sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, but aligned in such a way that they form right angles.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, not all diagonals are the same length. The length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices it skips. For example, a diagonal connecting two adjacent vertices is just a side, but skipping one vertex gives a longer diagonal, and so on.

So, let's denote the vertices of the dodecagon as V0, V1, V2, ..., V11 in order. Each vertex is separated by an angle of 30 degrees because 360/12 = 30.

For a rectangle to be formed, we need two pairs of parallel sides. In the case of a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be considered vectors from the center. So, for two lines to be parallel, their corresponding vectors must be scalar multiples of each other, but in the case of regular polygons, this would mean that
