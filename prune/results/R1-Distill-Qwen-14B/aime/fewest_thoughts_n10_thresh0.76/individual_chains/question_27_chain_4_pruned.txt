Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize what's going on here.

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the plane of the circle and 6 units away from the center. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution is 6. That makes the torus kind of like a donut shape with a thick ring. I remember that the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest inside or outside of this sphere. When it's inside and tangent, the tangency is along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, the tangency is along another circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how the torus and sphere can be tangent. When the torus is inside the sphere, they touch along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they touch along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles.

I think I need to consider the geometry of the torus and sphere. Let me recall some properties of a torus. The equation of a torus in 3D coordinates can be given in terms of its major and minor radii. If the major radius is R (which is 6 in this case) and the minor radius is r (which is 3), then the equation of the torus can be written as:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

So substituting R = 6 and r = 3, the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

But maybe using a different coordinate system would help. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the torus as a surface of revolution and consider the points where it touches the sphere.

The sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus must be such that the closest point on the torus touches the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the farthest point on the torus touches the sphere.

Wait, maybe I should think about the centers. The torus is centered at the origin, I assume, since the sphere is centered there. Or is it? Hmm, the sphere is probably centered at the origin, but the torus could be too. Let me clarify.

When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, it's tangent inside. So, the sphere of radius 11 is larger, and the torus is inside it. The point of tangency is along a circle; that suggests that the circle lies on a plane, probably the xy-plane if the torus is symmetric around the z-axis.

Wait, no, actually, the torus is symmetric around the axis of revolution, which is in the plane of the original circle. So if the original circle is in the x-y plane, and the axis is along, say, the x-axis, then the torus would be symmetric around the x-axis.

But the sphere is symmetric in all directions. So the points of tangency would form circles in planes that are perpendicular to the axis of the torus, I think.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of cross-sections. If I take a cross-section of the torus and sphere along the plane of the original circle, I can analyze their intersections.

Let me consider the cross-sectional view. The cross-section of the tor
