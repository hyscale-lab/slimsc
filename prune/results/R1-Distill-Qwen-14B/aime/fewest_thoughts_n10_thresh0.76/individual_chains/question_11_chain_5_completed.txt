Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then the conjugate of z divided by z is equal to r squared over z times its conjugate. But wait, maybe I should write z in terms of its magnitude and angle. Since |z| = 4, I can represent z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of θ, and maybe take the real part more easily.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because when you take the reciprocal of a complex number in polar form, you flip the magnitude and negate the angle.

Now, substituting z into the expression:

First term: (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}
Second term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So the entire expression becomes:
(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute the constants first:

(75 + 117i)*4 = 300 + 468i
(24 + 36i) is just 24 + 36i.

So, the expression simplifies to:
(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. The real part of a complex number in polar form is the projection onto the real axis, so I can use Euler's formula to expand the exponentials and then separate the real and imaginary parts.

Let's expand both terms:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
Second term: (24 + 36i)(cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ)) = (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Let me distribute each term:

First term:
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ
(since i^2 = -1)

Second term:
= 24 cosθ + 24(-i sinθ) + 36i cosθ + 36i(-i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + ( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ )i + 36 sinθ
(since i^2 = -1, so -i^2 = 1)

So now, let's combine the real parts from both terms and the imaginary parts separately.

Real parts:
From first term: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
From second term: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Total real part: (300 + 24)cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
From first term: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ
From second term: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
Total imaginary part: (300 sinθ - 24 sinθ) + (468 cosθ + 36 cosθ) = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

But since the problem only asks for the real part, I can ignore the imaginary part. So the expression I need to maximize is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. So I have the real part as 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. I need to find the maximum value of this expression.

I remember that an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of this expression is then C, since the cosine function is bounded between -1 and 1.

So, let's apply that. Let me compute C.

Given A = 324 and B = -432.

Wait, the expression is A cosθ + B sinθ, with A = 324 and B = -432.

The formula for C is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So let me compute that.

A^2 = 324^2. Let me compute 324^2:

324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2 = 576, and cross terms: 2*300*24 = 14,400. So (300 +24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 000? Wait, 90,000 + 14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, B^2 = (-432)^2 = 432^2. Let me compute that:

400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1,024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 +25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Hmm, sqrt(291600). Let's see, 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So 540^2 = (500 +40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2 = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600 = 291,600. So yes, sqrt(291600) is 540.

So C = 540. Therefore, the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Is that right? Let me double-check.

Wait, if we have A cosθ + B sinθ = C cos(θ - φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²), yes, that's correct. So the maximum value is C, which is 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me think again. The expression I'm maximizing is the real part of the given complex expression. So that's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as 540 cos(θ + φ), with φ such that cosφ = 324 / 540 and sinφ = 432 / 540? Wait, hold on.

Wait, let me clarify. The formula for A cosθ + B sinθ is C cos(θ - φ), where C is sqrt(A² + B²), and tanφ = B/A. Wait, no, actually, it's tanφ = B/A, but in our case, it's A cosθ + B sinθ, so for A and B, it's C cos(θ - φ), where cosφ = A/C and sinφ = B/C.

Wait, in this case, A is 324, B is -432.

So, C is sqrt(324² + (-432)²) = 540.

So cosφ = A/C = 324/540 = 0.6, and sinφ = B/C = -432/540 = -0.8.

So φ is an angle in the fourth quadrant where cosine is 0.6 and sine is -0.8. So φ is arctan(-432 / 324) = arctan(-4/3), which is -53.13 degrees or 360 - 53.13 = 306.87 degrees.

Therefore, the expression becomes 540 cos(θ - φ). The maximum value occurs when cos(θ - φ) is 1, so the maximum is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. So if I have 540 as the maximum, then that's the answer? But wait, let me check if I substituted everything correctly.

Wait, the expression I'm trying to maximize is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is indeed A cosθ + B sinθ with A=324 and B=-432. So yeah, the maximum is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the earlier steps.

So, starting from the original expression:

(75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z|=4.

I wrote z = 4 e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Then, (75 + 117i) *4 = 300 + 468i.

(96 + 144i)/4 = 24 +36i.

So, (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

Expanding each term, I correctly broke them down, right?

First term: 300 cosθ +300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ -468 sinθ.

Which gives real part: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ +468 cosθ.

Second term: 24 cosθ -24 i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ.

Real part:24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: -24 sinθ +36 cosθ.

Adding the real parts: 300+24=324 cosθ, -468 +36= -432 sinθ. So the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which I converted to 540 cos(θ - φ).

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

I just realized that 96 +144i is equal to 3*(32 +48i) which is 3*(something). Wait, maybe 96 +144i is 3*(32 +48i). Alternatively, 96 = 3*32, 144=3*48.

But perhaps that's not directly relevant.

Wait, another way to approach this problem is to let w = z, so that 1/w = \overline{w}/|w|^2. Since |w|=4, 1/w = \overline{w}/16.

So, the expression becomes (75 +117i)w + (96 +144i)(\overline{w}/16).

Simplify that: (75 +117i)w + (96 +144i)/16 \overline{w}.

Calculating (96 +144i)/16: 96/16=6, 144/16=9. So 6 +9i.

Therefore, the expression is (75+117i)w + (6 +9i)\overline{w}.

Hmm, maybe that's a simpler way to write it. So, expression = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i) \overline{w}.

Since w is a complex number with |w|=4, we can write w = 4 e^{iθ}, and \overline{w} =4 e^{-iθ}.

So substituting, we get:

(75 +117i)*4 e^{iθ} + (6 +9i)*4 e^{-iθ}

= (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}

Which is exactly the same expression as before. So, this confirms that the previous steps are correct.

Therefore, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which we found to be maximum 540.

So, the answer is 540.

Wait, but I just thought of another approach. Since the expression is linear in z and 1/z, perhaps I can write it as A z + B /z, where A=75+117i and B=96+144i.

And since |z|=4, perhaps I can use the identity that for such expressions, the maximum real part can be found by |A| |z| + |B| /|z|, but only when A and B are real numbers, which they are not in this case. So, that approach doesn't directly apply.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or inner products, as complex numbers can be treated as vectors.

Wait, another idea: Let me write the entire expression as:

E = (75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z.

Let me write it as E = (75 +117i) z + (96 +144i) \overline{z}/|z|^2.

Since |z|=4, \overline{z}/|z|^2 = (1/4) \overline{z}.

So, E = (75 +117i) z + (6 +9i) \overline{z}.

Now, since z is a complex number, perhaps I can write z as x + iy, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since z is a complex number, and we're dealing with Re(E), perhaps express everything in terms of Re(z) and Im(z), and then take derivatives to find maximum. But that might be messy.

Alternatively, think of E as a function of θ, since z = 4 e^{iθ}, so we can write E as a function of θ, and then take the derivative with respect to θ and set it to zero to find the maximum. But given that we already expressed Re(E) as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which we've converted to 540 cos(θ - φ), which clearly has maximum 540, perhaps that's the simplest way.

Therefore, I think the maximum real part is indeed 540.

Wait, but let me just see if there's an alternative way. Maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something similar.

Wait, for expressions of the form Re(A z + B \overline{z}), perhaps we can express it as Re(A z) + Re(B \overline{z}) = Re(A z) + Re(\overline{B z^*}), but I might be complicating things.

Alternatively, write Re(A z + B \overline{z}) = Re(A z) + Re(B \overline{z}) = Re(A z) + Re(\overline{B z}) = Re(A z) + Re(\overline{B z}).

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, since A and B are complex numbers, perhaps express the real part as the dot product of vectors.

Wait, let me think. Let me represent z as a vector (x, y), so z = x + iy. Then, \overline{z} = x - iy.

Then, E = (75 +117i)(x +iy) + (96 +144i)(x - iy)/4.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (75 +117i)(x + iy) = 75x +75i y +117i x +117i^2 y = 75x + (75y +117x)i -117 y.

So, real part: 75x -117 y.

Imaginary part:75y +117x.

Second term: (96 +144i)(x -iy)/4 = [96x +96(-iy) +144i x +144i (-iy)] /4

= [96x -96i y +144i x -144 i^2 y ] /4

= [96x -96i y +144i x +144 y ] /4

Since i^2 = -1, so -144 i^2 y = +144 y.

Now, group terms:

Real parts: 96x +144 y

Imaginary parts: (-96 y +144 x) i

So, divide by 4:

Real part: (96x +144 y)/4 =24x +36 y.

Imaginary part: (-96 y +144 x)/4 i = (-24 y +36 x) i.

Therefore, the entire expression E is:

First term: (75x -117 y) + i(75y +117x)

Second term: (24x +36 y) + i(-24 y +36 x)

Adding them together:

Real part: (75x -117 y) + (24x +36 y) = (75+24)x + (-117+36)y =99x -81 y.

Imaginary part: (75y +117x) + (-24 y +36 x) = (117x +36x) + (75y -24 y) =153x +51y.

So, E = (99x -81 y) + i (153x +51 y).

But wait, since |z|=4, meaning sqrt(x^2 + y^2) =4.

So, the real part is 99x -81 y, which we need to maximize subject to x^2 + y^2 =16.

Hmm, so now the problem reduces to maximizing 99x -81 y, with x² + y²=16.

This is a standard maximization problem. The maximum of a linear function over a circle can be found using the method of Lagrange multipliers or by recognizing that the maximum is the magnitude of the gradient vector times the radius.

Wait, the maximum of a linear function a x + b y over the circle x² + y² = r² is sqrt(a² + b²) * r.

So, in this case, a=99, b=-81, r=4.

So, maximum value is sqrt(99² + (-81)^2) *4.

Compute 99²: 99*99=9801.

81²=6561.

So, sqrt(9801 +6561) = sqrt(16362).

Wait, 16362. Hmm, let me see if this is a perfect square.

Wait, 127²=16129, 128²=16384. So 127²=16129, 128²=16384. 16362 is between these two.

Wait, 128²=16384, so 16362 is 22 less, so not a perfect square. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 99² is 9801, 81² is 6561. 9801 +6561= 16362.

Wait, 127²=16129, 128²=16384, so 16362 is 22 less than 16384. So sqrt(16362)= approx 127.9. But we can write it as sqrt(16362)=sqrt(9*1818)=3*sqrt(1818). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, but wait a second. Earlier, when I did the polar form approach, I found the maximum real part to be 540, but using this Cartesian approach, I'm getting something different.

Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake here. Let me double-check my steps.

Wait, in the polar form approach, the real part was 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which I converted to 540 cos(θ + φ), so the maximum was 540.

But in the Cartesian approach, I have the real part as 99x -81y, which with x²+y²=16, the maximum is sqrt(99² +81²)*4.

Wait, 99² +81² is 9801 +6561= 16362, so sqrt(16362) is approximately 127.9, multiplied by 4 is about 511.6.

Wait, but in the polar approach, I got 540, which is higher than this Cartesian approach. That can't be right. There must be a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the conversion from the expression to real and imaginary parts. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, when I represented E as (75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z, and then wrote z=4 e^{iθ}, 1/z=(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, E = (75 +117i)*4 e^{iθ} + (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Which is (300 +468i)e^{iθ} + (24 +36i)e^{-iθ}.

Expanding each term:

First term: (300 +468i)(cosθ +i sinθ)=300 cosθ +300i sinθ +468i cosθ +468i² sinθ=300 cosθ + (300 sinθ +468 cosθ)i -468 sinθ.

So real part:300 cosθ -468 sinθ.

Second term: (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ)=24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i² sinθ=24 cosθ + ( -24 sinθ +36 cosθ )i +36 sinθ.

So real part:24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

Total real part: (300 +24)cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So, that seems correct.

In the Cartesian approach, when I expressed z as x + iy, I found Re(E) =99x -81 y. Wait, but that seems different. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cartesian approach in the expansion.

Wait, let me go back.

Original expression:

E = (75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z.

Expressed as E = (75 +117i) (x +iy) + (96 +144i)/(x +iy).

Wait, but 1/(x +iy) = (x - iy)/(x² + y²) = (x - iy)/16, since |z|=4, so x² + y²=16.

So, E = (75 +117i)(x +iy) + (96 +144i)(x - iy)/16.

Compute each part.

First term: (75 +117i)(x +iy).

=75x +75i y +117i x +117i^2 y.

=75x +75i y +117i x -117 y.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real:75x -117 y.

Imaginary:75y +117x.

Second term: (96 +144i)(x - iy)/16.

= [96x -96i y +144i x -144i^2 y ] /16.

= [96x -96i y +144i x +144 y ] /16.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: (96x +144 y)/16 =6x +9 y.

Imaginary: (-96 y +144 x)/16 i = (-6 y +9 x) i.

So, adding both terms:

Real parts: (75x -117 y) + (6x +9 y) = (75+6)x + (-117 +9)y=81x -108 y.

Imaginary parts: (75y +117x) i + (-6 y +9 x)i = (75y -6y +117x +9x) i = (69y +126x) i.

Wait, earlier, when I did the expansion, I must have made a mistake. So in the real part, it's 81x -108 y, not 99x -81y.

Wait, so that was my mistake. In my first Cartesian approach, I had 99x -81y, but that was incorrect. The correct real part is 81x -108 y.

So, with |z|=4, so x² + y²=16.

So now, the real part is 81x -108 y. We need to maximize this expression.

As before, the maximum of a linear function a x + b y over the circle x² + y²= r² is sqrt(a² + b²) * r.

So, a=81, b=-108, r=4.

So, sqrt(81² + (-108)^2) *4.

Compute 81²=6561, 108²=11664.

Sum:6561 +11664=18225.

sqrt(18225)=135.

So, maximum is 135*4=540.

Ah! Now, this matches the result from the polar form approach. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial Cartesian expansion. So the correct maximum is indeed 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Express \(z\) in polar form**: Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). Then, \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

2. **Substitute \(z\) and \(1/z\) into the expression**:
   \[
   (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
   \]
   Simplify the constants:
   \[
   (75 + 117i) \cdot 4 = 300 + 468i, \quad \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i.
   \]
   Thus, the expression becomes:
   \[
   (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
   \]

3. **Expand using Euler's formula**:
   - For \((300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}\):
     \[
     300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta.
     \]
     Real part: \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\).
   - For \((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\):
     \[
     24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.
     \]
     Real part: \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\).

4. **Combine the real parts**:
   \[
   \text{Total real part} = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
   \]

5. **Maximize the real part**: The expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) can be rewritten in the form \(C\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(C = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\). Compute \(C\):
   \[
   C = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
   \]
   The maximum value of \(C\cos(\theta + \phi)\) is \(C\), which is \(540\).

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
