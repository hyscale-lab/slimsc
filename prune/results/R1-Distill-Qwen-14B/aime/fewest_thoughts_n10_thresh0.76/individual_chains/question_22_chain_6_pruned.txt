Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, and it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Also, the hexagon is equilateral, which means all its sides are equal in length. Let's call the length of each side 's'. 

The problem says that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I'm supposed to find the side length 's' of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to visualize this hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but scaled in some way. But not necessarily regular because regular hexagons have all sides equal and all angles equal, but in this case, we don't know about the anglesâ€”only that opposite sides are parallel and all sides are equal.

Because opposite sides are parallel, this hexagon is what's called a "centrosymmetric" hexagon. That means it has a center of symmetry, and each vertex has an opposite vertex. So A is opposite to D, B opposite to E, and C opposite to F. This also implies that the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by two congruent trapezoids or something like that.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, these three lines will meet at three points forming a triangle. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. I need to find how this relates to the side length 's' of the hexagon.

I think this has to do with similar triangles and the properties of the hexagon's sides. Since all sides of the hexagon are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of these sides will form a larger triangle outside the hexagon. The idea is that the hexagon can be thought of as a sort of truncated triangle, where each side of the triangle has been indented by a smaller similar triangle.

Wait, maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides? But no, the hexagon's sides are all equal, but the triangle's sides are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is such that the extensions of AB, CD, and EF create a triangle, and the hexagon is in some way a part of that triangle, with each side of the hexagon being a portion of each side of the triangle.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors or coordinates. Let me try assigning coordinates to the hexagon's vertices.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, maybe I can model it in a coordinate system where each opposite pair lies along the same line. Let's say, for example, that AB is vertical, so DE is also vertical. Similarly, BC and EF are horizontal, and CD and FA are at some angle.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I can model the hexagon as a centrally symmetric hexagon, so that for
