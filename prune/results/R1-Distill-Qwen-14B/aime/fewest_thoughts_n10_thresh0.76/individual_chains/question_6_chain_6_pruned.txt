Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: one is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and the other is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. These are absolute value functions, so their graphs will be V-shaped or piecewise linear.

Let me sketch f(x) first. The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2, which shifts the graph down by 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that, ||x| - 1/2|, flips any part of the graph that's below the x-axis back up. So for |x| - 1/2, when |x| < 1/2, the expression becomes negative, so taking absolute value would make it positive. That means f(x) will have a V-shape with vertices at x = ±1/2 and x=0. Wait, actually, let me think again.

Wait, f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So the function inside is |x| - 1/2, which is a V shifted down by 1/2. So the critical points are where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is when |x| = 1/2, so x = ±1/2. So the graph of |x| -1/2 is a V-shape that touches the x-axis at x=±1/2 and goes to infinity as |x| increases. Then taking the absolute value of that, which would reflect any part below the x-axis upwards. But wait, |x| -1/2 is positive when |x| ≥ 1/2, so f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is equal to |x| -1/2 for |x| ≥1/2, and 1/2 - |x| for |x| <1/2. So f(x) is a W-shaped graph? Wait, no, it's actually two Vs. Let me think: for |x| ≥ 1/2, it's |x| -1/2, which is linear with slope ±1. For |x| <1/2, it's 1/2 - |x|, which is also linear with slope ∓1. So f(x) is a V that has its vertex at (0, 1/2), then it goes down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), and then goes back up. So it's like a diamond shape, symmetric about both axes.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Let me do the same analysis. The inner function is |x| -1/4, which is a V shifted down by 1/4. The critical point is at |x|=1/4, so x=±1/4. So the function |x| -1/4 is positive outside of |x|=1/4 and negative inside. Taking absolute value, so g(x) = ||x| -1/4| is equal to |x| -1/4 for |x| ≥1/4 and 1/4 - |x| for |x| <1/4. So g(x) is another diamond shape but with vertices at (0,1/4), (1/4,0), and (-1/4,0). So it's a V that peaks at 1/4 and touches the x-axis at ±1/4.

Now, the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4g(f(cos(3πy))) are given. Let me try to understand each function.

Let's start with y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). So f(sin(2πx)) is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Then g of that is |||sin(2πx)| -1/2| -1/4|. Then we multiply the result by 4. So overall, y is a function that's built from sin(2πx), transformed through f and then g, then scaled by 4.

Similarly, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So f(cos(3πy)) is ||cos(3πy)| -1/2|. Then g of that is |||cos(3πy)| -1/2| -1/4|. Multiply this by 4, and set x equal to that.

So, finding the number of intersections between these two graphs would mean finding all (x,y) pairs where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) simultaneously.

This seems quite involved, so maybe I should first figure out the possible ranges and periodicity of these functions.

Let's think about the inner functions first. sin(2πx) has a period of 1, right? Because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k. So here, k=2π, so period is 2π/(2π)=1. Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So both functions have periods of 1 and 2/3.

But then, when we apply the absolute value, we might affect the period. Wait, no, because |sin(2πx)| has a period of 1/2, since the absolute value makes the function repeat every half period. Similarly, |cos(3πy)| has a period of (2/3)/2 = 1/3.

Wait, let me make sure. The function |sin(2πx)| has a period of 1/(2π)*(π) )= 1/2? Wait, sin(2πx) has period 1, so |sin(2πx)| will have period 1/2 because it's symmetric about each half-period.

Similarly, cos(3πy) has period 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So |cos(3πy)| would have period (2/3)/2=1/3.

So, f(x) = ||x| -1/2|. Let's see how f(sin(2πx)) behaves. Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1. So |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So f(sin(2πx)) is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Since |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1, the expression inside f is between -1/2 and 1/2. Then, taking absolute makes it between 0 and 1/2. Wait, let me compute f(sin(2πx)).

Wait, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| is a transformation: subtract 1/2 and take absolute.

So when |sin(2πx)| is less than 1/2, the expression becomes 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|. When it's greater than or equal to 1/2, it's |sin(2πx)| - 1/2.

Then, g(f(sin(2πx))) is || |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | -1/4 |. So let's denote z = f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| -1/2|. Then g(z) = ||z -1/4|.

So, z can vary between 0 and 1/2. Because when |sin(2πx)| is 0, z is 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 1, z is 1/2. So z is in [0,1/2].

Then, g(z) is ||z -1/4|. So let's analyze that. z is between 0 and 1/2. Then z -1/4 can be negative or positive.

When z < 1/4, z -1/4 is negative, so ||z -1/4| is 1/4 - z.

When z ≥1/4, it's z -1/4.

So, g
