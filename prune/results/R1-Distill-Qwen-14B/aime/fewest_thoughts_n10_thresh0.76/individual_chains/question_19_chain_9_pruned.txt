Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here. It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step. First, I remember that the circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. So, R = 13, r = 6.

The problem also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the segment from the incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the segment from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. So, IA ⊥ OI.

I need to find AB · AC. Hmm, AB · AC sounds like I need the product of two sides. Maybe I can relate this to other properties of the triangle.

I remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can sometimes be related to the area or other elements like the inradius or circumradius. Let me jot down some formulas I know.

First, the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius: Area = (a * b * c) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides.

But here, I need AB · AC. Let me denote AB = c, BC = a, and AC = b, following the standard notation where a is opposite angle A, but wait, actually, usually a is BC, opposite angle A, b is AC, opposite angle B, and c is AB, opposite angle C. So, yeah, that's correct.

So, AB = c, AC = b. So, I need to find b * c.

Hmm, let's see. The area is r * s, and also (a * b * c)/(4R). Maybe I can relate these. But I don't know a, b, c yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find some relationship using the given condition that IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IOA is a right triangle with right angle at I.

So, in triangle IOA, we have:

(OI)^2 + (IA)^2 = (OA)^2.

Because of the Pythagorean theorem. But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA = 13.

But what is OI? OI is the distance between the circumcenter and incenter. I remember there's a formula for OI in terms of R, r, and other triangle parameters.

Yes, the formula is OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Let me confirm that. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). So, OI^2 = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but in triangle IOA, OI is one leg, IA is the other leg, and OA is the hypotenuse. So, OI^2 + IA^2 = OA^2.

So, substituting, (13)^2 = (sqrt(13))^2 + IA^2.

Wait, that would be 169 = 13 + IA^2. So IA^2 = 156. So, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, okay. Now, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I know that in a triangle, the length from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and the angles.

Wait, more accurately, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. There's a formula for that. Let me recall.

Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be given by IA = r / sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me think. The inradius is r, and the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be found using trigonometric relations.

Wait, in the inradius, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side. So, considering the inradius, which is 6, and the angle at A, which is angle A, the distance from I to A would be IA.

In the inradius, the inradius is perpendicular to the side, so in the triangle formed by I, A, and the point where the inradius meets BC, we can form a right triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that IA can be expressed as IA = (r) / (sin(A/2)). Hmm, wait, no, that seems off.

Wait, I think the formula is IA = (r) / (sin
