Alright, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50-50 chance. I need to find the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that maps all the blue vertices to positions that were originally red. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Okay, let's try to break this down.

First, let's visualize a regular octagon. It has 8 sides, and each vertex is equally spaced. The key here is that we're dealing with rotations. Since it's regular, rotations by multiples of 45 degrees (which is 360/8) will map the octagon onto itself. So the rotation group here is cyclic of order 8, meaning we can rotate by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which are 8 distinct rotations.

The question is about the probability that there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices end up where red vertices were. So, if we color the octagon, and then rotate it by some multiple of 45°, all the blue points should align with red points from the original coloring.

Wait, actually, to clarify: each vertex is colored red or blue. After coloring, we want to rotate the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, it's like the image of the blue set under rotation must be a subset of the red set. But more precisely, since we're considering all blue vertices, their images after rotation must exactly match the red positions.

Hmm, so perhaps another way to think about it is that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because the octagon is regular, the red and blue sets must be rotations of each other.

But wait, the octagon is colored with red and blue independently, each with probability 1/2. So, each coloring is a 8-length binary string, with each bit being red or blue.

We need the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Or, more accurately, the blue set is a translate (rotation) of the red set. Because a rotation
