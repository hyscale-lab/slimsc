Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, so I need to find the smallest prime p where some number n makes n⁴ +1 divisible by p squared. Then, for that p, find the smallest m with the same property.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, let's think about primes where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n. I remember that for primes, there are certain conditions on when -1 is a quartic residue. Maybe I should start by checking small primes and see if they satisfy the condition.

Starting with the smallest primes:

1. p=2: Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 2²=4.

Testing n=1: 1⁴ +1=2, which is not divisible by 4.
n=2: 16 +1=17, which is not divisible by 4.
Wait, actually, n must be a positive integer. Maybe n=1 is the smallest. But 1⁴ +1=2, which isn't divisible by 4. So p=2 doesn't work because n⁴ +1 is 2, which isn't divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

2. Next prime is p=3.

Check if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9.

Compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod 9 has residues 0-8).

n=1: 1 mod 9 → 1. So 1 +1=2 mod 9, not 0.
n=2: 16 mod 9 is 7. 7 +1=8 mod 9 ≠0.
n=3: 81 mod9=0. 0 +1=1 mod9≠0.
n=4: 256 mod9. Let's compute 4⁴=256. 256 divided by 9: 27*9=243, 256-243=13 → 13 mod9 is 4. 4+1=5≠0.
n=5: 5⁴=625. 625 mod9: 625/9=69*9=621, remainder 4. So 4+1=5≠0.
n=6: 6⁴=1296. mod9 is 0. 0+1=1≠0.
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod9. 7+1=8≠0.
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: Sum digits 4+0+9+6=19→10→1 mod9. So 1+1=2≠0.

So p=3 doesn't work either. No n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9.

Next prime p=5.

Check if any n from 1 to 4 (since modulo 5) satisfies n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Wait, actually, wait. For mod 25, I should check n from 1 to 24 or something, but maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe check if -1 is a quartic residue modulo 5²=25.

First, let's compute n⁴ mod25 for small n.

n=1: 1 mod25. 1+1=2≠0.
n=2: 16 mod25. 16+1=17≠0.
n=3: 81 mod25=6. 6+1=7≠0.
n=4: 256 mod25=6. 6+1=7≠0.
n=5: 625 mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.
n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod25: 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21. 21+1=22≠0.
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod25: 2401 - 25*96=2401-2400=1. 1+1=2≠0.
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod25: 4096-25*163=4096-4075=21. 21+1=22≠0.
n=9: 9⁴=6561. 6561 mod25: 6561 - 25*262=6561-6550=11. 11+1=12≠0.
n=10: 10⁴=10000 mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.
n=11: 11⁴=14641. 14641 mod25: 14641 - 25*585=14641-14625=16. 16+1=17≠0.
n=12: 12⁴=20736 mod25. 20736 -25*829=20736-20725=11. 11+1=12≠0.
n=13: 13⁴=28561 mod25. 28561 -25*1142=28561-28550=11. 11+1=1
