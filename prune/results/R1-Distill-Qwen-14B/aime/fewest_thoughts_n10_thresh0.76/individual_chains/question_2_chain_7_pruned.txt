Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to visualize and understand what's given and what's being asked.

First, the points given are O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis. Let me calculate the distance from O to A and O to B. OA is 1/2 units, and OB is sqrt(3)/2 units. Hmm, that seems familiarâ€”like a 30-60-90 triangle.

Wait, AB is a segment connecting A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of line AB. The slope (m) would be (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form, starting from point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. That's the equation of AB.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, lying in the first quadrant. So each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), with p and q positive, and the length of PQ is 1. The length of PQ can be calculated using the distance formula: sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Therefore, for all points P(p, 0) and Q(0, q) in the first quadrant with p^2 + q^2 = 1, the segment PQ is part of the family F.

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, not A or B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except AB. So, C is on AB, and for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

We need to find OC^2, where O is the origin, and express it as a fraction p/q with p and q coprime, then find p + q.

I think the key here is to find point C on AB such that for any other PQ in F, C does not lie on PQ. So, C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

Let me parametrize point C on AB. Since AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), we can represent C as a point moving from A to B. Let me use a parameter t, where t=0 is at A and t=1 is at B. So, the coordinates of C would be (1/2 - (1/2)t, 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t) = (1/2(1 - t), sqrt(3)/2 t). So, C = ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2) t ).

Now, we need to find t such that C is not on any PQ in F except when PQ is AB itself.

Wait, but AB is part of F because AB is a segment of unit length? Wait, let me check. The length of AB: from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so AB is indeed in F. So, when t is between 0 and 1, point C is on AB, which is in F. But we need C to not be on any other segment from F. So, for other PQ in F, C should not lie on PQ.

So, how can we ensure that? Maybe by finding the point C where the line AB is tangent to some curve related to F.

Alternatively, perhaps C lies on the envelope of all such segments PQ in F. The envelope would be a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, if AB is part of such an envelope, then C is the point of tangency.

Wait, that might be a way to approach this. Let's think about the family of lines PQ. Each PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p^
