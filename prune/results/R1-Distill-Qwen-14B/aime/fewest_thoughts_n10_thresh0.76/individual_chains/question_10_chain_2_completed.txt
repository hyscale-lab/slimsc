Okay, so I've got this problem here: Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand this. So, A is a set of positive integers. Then Bob is considering all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is an element of A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. My task is to figure out what A is, and then sum its elements.

Alright, so first, let's think about how many sets B Bob is considering. Each B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and the maximum element of B must be in A. So, if A has elements, say, a1, a2, ..., an, then each B must have a maximum element equal to one of these a_i's.

Wait, so for each a in A, Bob can form sets B where the maximum is a. The number of such sets would be the number of nonempty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} that have a as their maximum element.

But wait, actually, the set B could have any elements less than or equal to a, as long as the maximum is a. Oh, but B can't have elements larger than a, because then the maximum would be larger than a.

So, for each a in A, the number of finite nonempty sets B with maximum a is equal to the number of nonempty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} plus 1 (the set containing just a itself). Wait, no, actually, the subsets can include any combination of elements from 1 to a, as long as a is included. So, the number of such sets is 2^{a-1}. Because for each element less than a, you can choose to include it or not, but you must include a.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. Because for each element less than a, it's a binary choiceâ€”include it or not. So for a-1 elements, that's 2^{a-1} subsets, each of which includes a. So, the number of sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, if A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}.

So, total number of B sets = sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find A such that this sum is 2024, and then compute the sum of elements in A.

Alright, so now, I think the key is to find a set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024. So, let me think about how to represent 2024 as a sum of powers of 2.

Wait, 2024 is a specific number. Let me compute 2^10. 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048. So, 2^11 is 2048 which is just a bit more than 2024. So, 2024 is between 2^10 and 2^11.

Wait, so maybe 2024 can be expressed as a sum of smaller powers of 2. Let me see: 2024 divided by 2 is 1012, divided by 2 again is 506, again 253, which is odd. So, 2024 in binary would be 11111101000. Wait, let me check that.

Alternatively, let me compute 2024 in binary.

2024 divided by 2 is 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2=506 r0

506/2=253 r0

253/2=126 r1

126/2=63 r0

63/2=31 r1

31/2=15 r1

15/2=7 r1

7/2=3 r1

3/2=1 r1

1/2=0 r1.

So writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0.

Wait, let me count the bits. Let's see:

Starting from the last division:

1st division: 1

2nd:1

3rd:1

4th:1

5th:1

6th:0

7th:1

8th:0

9th:0

10th:0

So, 2024 is 11111101000 in binary, which is 10 bits.

So, that would correspond to 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^2.

Wait, let's compute:

2^9 = 512

2^8=256

2^7=128

2^6=64

2^5=32

2^4=16

2^2=4

Wait, 512+256=768; 768+128=896; 896+64=960; 960+32=992; 992+16=1008; 1008+4=1012. Wait, that's only 1012. Hmm, that's not 2024.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the binary representation. Let me recount.

Wait, 2024 divided by 2 gives 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2=506, remainder 0.

506/2=253, remainder 0.

253/2=126, remainder 1.

126/2=63, remainder 0.

63/2=31, remainder 1.

31/2=15, remainder 1.

15/2=7, remainder 1.

7/2=3, remainder 1.

3/2=1, remainder 1.

1/2=0, remainder 1.

So, writing the remainders from last to first: 1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0.

Wait, that's 11 bits. Let me write it out:

1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0.

So, from the right, the bits are 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1.

Wait, maybe I should write it as 11111101000.

Wait, so 11111101000 is 10 bits.

But 11111101000 is 2024? Let me calculate:

Starting from the right:

The bits are: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the order. Let me clarify. Each division step gives a remainder, which is the next bit to the right.

So, the first remainder is the least significant bit.

So, the remainders from first to last are:

0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1.

Wait, so the binary number is 11111101000, where the rightmost bit is 0.

Wait, let me compute the value of 11111101000.

Starting from the right:

Positions (from right): 0 to 9,10.

Wait, 11111101000 is 11 bits:

Positions (from right, starting at 0):

Bit 10:1,

Bit 9:1,

Bit8:1,

Bit7:1,

Bit6:1,

Bit5:1,

Bit4:0,

Bit3:1,

Bit2:0,

Bit1:0,

Bit0:0.

So, the value is:

2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 +2^7 +2^6 +2^5 + 0 +2^3 +0 +0 +0.

Compute that:

2^10=1024,

2^9=512,

2^8=256,

2^7=128,

2^6=64,

2^5=32,

2^3=8.

Adding these together:

1024 + 512 = 1536,

1536 +256=1792,

1792+128=1920,

1920+64=1984,

1984+32=2016,

2016+8=2024.

Yes, that adds up to 2024. So, 2024 is 11111101000 in binary, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Wait, so 2024 is equal to 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10.

So, 2024 = 8 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024.

But wait, in the original problem, the total number of sets is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, 2024 is the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A.

So, if I can express 2024 as the sum of distinct powers of 2, then each 2^{a-1} corresponds to a unique a in A.

Because each a in A must be a positive integer, and 2^{a-1} is a power of two. But, wait, 2^{a-1} could be overlapping if a-1 is same for different a's, but since A is a set, each a is unique. So, each a will contribute a unique power of two.

Therefore, to get 2024, which is 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10, we can set a-1 to each of these exponents.

So, for each term 2^k in the sum, a = k + 1.

Wait, so for 2^3, a is 4,

for 2^5, a is 6,

for 2^6, a is 7,

for 2^7, a is 8,

for 2^8, a is 9,

for 2^9, a is 10,

for 2^10, a is 11.

So, the elements of A would be 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, let me check: 2^{3} is 8, which corresponds to a=4,

2^5 is 32 (a=6),

2^6 is 64 (a=7),

2^7 is 128 (a=8),

2^8 is 256 (a=9),

2^9 is 512 (a=10),

2^10 is 1024 (a=11).

Adding these up: 8+32+64+128+256+512+1024=2024, yes, that's correct.

So, the set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Then, the sum of the elements of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me add them up:

4+6=10,

10+7=17,

17+8=25,

25+9=34,

34+10=44,

44+11=55.

So, the sum is 55.

Wait, but hold on a second. Is this the only possible way to represent 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2? Because 2024 is a unique number in binary, so yes, this is the only way to write it as a sum of distinct powers of two. So, the set A must be {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, and the sum is 55.

Wait, but let me make sure that the reasoning is correct. So, each a in A contributes 2^{a-1} sets B. The total is 2024. So, the sum of 2^{a-1} over all a in A is 2024. Since 2024 is a sum of distinct powers of two, each a-1 must be the exponents in that binary decomposition.

So, because 2^{a-1} must be unique for each a in A, because if two a's had the same a-1, they would contribute the same term, which would not be allowed since 2^{a-1} is unique for each a. So, the a's must correspond to exponents in the binary decomposition.

Therefore, the a's are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11, as above, with sum 55.

So, I think that's the answer. The sum is 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The total number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. We need to determine the sum of the elements of \( A \).

Each set \( B \) with maximum element \( a \) in \( A \) contributes \( 2^{a-1} \) sets. Therefore, the total number of sets \( B \) is given by:

\[
\sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024
\]

Expressing 2024 in binary, we find it is \( 11111101000_2 \), which corresponds to the sum of powers of 2:

\[
2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 = 2024
\]

Each term \( 2^{a-1} \) corresponds to an element \( a \) in \( A \). Thus, the elements of \( A \) are \( 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \). Summing these elements:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
