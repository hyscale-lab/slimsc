Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I think I can handle this by using the properties of logarithms and maybe some substitution. Let me write down what's given.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

I remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, maybe I can apply that property here.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, so each equation has a logarithm with swapped base and argument. I recall that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). That's the reciprocal property of logarithms. So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Maybe I can use that to relate the two equations.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So substituting into the equations:

1. x * A = 10 → x = 10 / A
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10 → 4y = 10A → y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of A.

x = 10 / A

y = (5A)/2

But I can also express log_x(y) in terms of x and y. Let's recall that log_x(y) = ln(y) / ln(x), where ln is the natural logarithm. Alternatively, since I have expressions for x and y in terms of A, maybe I can find another equation involving A.

Wait, but I already used the reciprocal property. Maybe I can substitute x and y back into one of the original logarithmic equations. Let's see.

Wait, another approach: since I have x = 10 / A and y = (5A)/2, maybe I can express y in terms of x or vice versa.

Let me try expressing A from the first equation. From x * A = 10 → A = 10 / x.

Then, from y = (5A)/2, substituting A gives y = (5*(10/x))/2 = (50)/(2x) = 25 / x.

So now I have y = 25 / x.

So, the product xy would be x*(25/x) = 25. Wait, is that possible? That seems too straightforward. Let me check if this is correct.

Wait, hold on. If xy =25, does that satisfy the original equations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me go back step by step.

First, I have:

Equation 1: x * log_x(y) =10 → log_x(y) =10/x.

Equation 2: 4y * log_y(x) =10 → log_y(x) =10/(4y).

But since log_y(x) =1 / log_x(y), so 1 / log_x(y) =10/(4y).

Substituting log_x(y) from equation 1: 1/(10/x) =10/(4y).

Simplify left side: x/10 =10/(4y).

Cross-multiplying: x *4y =
