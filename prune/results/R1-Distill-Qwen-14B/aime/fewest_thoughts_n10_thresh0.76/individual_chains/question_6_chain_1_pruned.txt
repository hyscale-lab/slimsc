Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm supposed to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are:

\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \]

And I'm given that \( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \) and \( g(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{4}| \).

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe if I break it down step by step, I can figure it out.

First, I should probably understand what the functions \( f \) and \( g \) look like. They are both absolute value functions, so their graphs will have V-shapes or combinations of V-shapes.

Starting with \( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \). Let me think about that. The inner part is \( |x| \), which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting \( \tfrac{1}{2} \) shifts it down by \( \tfrac{1}{2} \), so the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value of that, it will reflect any negative parts back up. So, the graph of \( | |x| - 1/2 | \) will have vertices where \( |x| - 1/2 = 0 \), which is at \( x = \pm 1/2 \). So, the points will be at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). Between -1/2 and 1/2, the function \( |x| - 1/2 \) is negative, so taking the absolute value will flip it up. So, the graph will look like a W, maybe? Or perhaps a diamond shape with vertices at (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2), (-1/2, 0), and back to (0,1/2). Wait, no, actually, let's plot some points.

Wait, when x is 0, f(x) = | |0| - 1/2 | = | -1/2 | = 1/2. When x is 1/2, f(x) is | |1/2| - 1/2 | = | 0 | = 0. Similarly, at x=1, f(x) = |1 - 1/2| = |1/2| = 1/2. So, the graph is a V shape at x=0 with a peak at 1/2, then goes down to 0 at x=1/2, then up again to 1/2 at x=1. So it's like a diamond shape between x=-1/2 and x=1/2, but actually, no, it's a V with the vertex at x=0, but then when you subtract 1/2 and take absolute value, it's more like a W shape but only over certain intervals. Hmm, maybe I should sketch it mentally.

Wait, no. Let's think differently. Let's consider f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |. Let me consider x >=0 first, since the function is even, so symmetric about the y-axis. So for x >=0, f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So, for x from 0 to 1/2, x -1/2 is negative, so |x -1/2| = 1/2 -x. So between 0 and 1/2, the function is a line starting at (0, 1/2) and going down to (1/2, 0). Then for x >=1/2, |x -1/2| = x -1/2, which is a line starting at (1/2,0) going up with slope 1. So, the graph for x >=0 is a V-shape with vertex at (1/2, 0), connected to the point (0,1/2). And since the function is even, the same applies for x <=0. So overall, the graph of f(x) is like a diamond with vertices at (0,1/2), (1/2,0), (0,-1/2), (-1/2, 0). Wait, no, because for x >=1/2, it goes up, but for x <= -1/2, it would also go up. Wait, no, because for x negative, |x| is positive
