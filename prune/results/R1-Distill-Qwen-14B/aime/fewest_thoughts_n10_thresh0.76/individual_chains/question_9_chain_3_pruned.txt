Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product xy, given that log base x of y^x is 10 and log base y of x^{4y} is also 10. Both x and y are greater than 1. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but they have some properties that might help here. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a), I can rewrite that as x * log_x(y) = 10. So, that simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, log_x(y) is the exponent I need to raise x to get y. Let me denote that as a variable to make it easier. Let me call log_x(y) = a. Then, according to the equation, x * a = 10. So, a = 10 / x.

But since a is log_x(y), that means y = x^a, right? Because if log_x(y) = a, then y = x^a. Substituting a here, y = x^(10/x). Hmm, that's one equation involving x and y.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

I also know that log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y) because of the change of base formula. Since log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y) = 1/a. So, substituting that into the equation, we get 4y * (1/a) = 10.

But we already found that a = 10/x, so substituting that in, we get 4y * (x / 10) = 10. Let's write that out: (4y * x) / 10 = 10. Multiplying both sides by 10 gives 4xy = 100. Dividing both sides by 4, we get xy = 25. Wait, is that it? That's the product we're looking for, xy. But let me double-check because that seems straightforward.

Wait, so if I've got xy = 25, is that consistent with the first equation? Let me see. From the first equation, I had y = x^(10/x). So, substituting y in terms of x, let's see if xy =25 holds.

So, substituting y = x^(10/x) into xy, we get x * x^(10/x) = x^(1 + 10/x). And we're saying this equals 25. So, x^(1 + 10/x) = 25.

Hmm, that's an equation in x. Maybe I can solve for x here. Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier. So, ln(x^(1 + 10/x)) = ln(25). Using the power rule again, this becomes (1 + 10/x) * ln(x) = ln(25).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can let t = x, so we have (1 + 10/t) * ln(t) = ln(25). Not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a value of x that satisfies this equation.

Wait, is there a nice integer value for x that would make xy=25? Let's think. Since both x and y are greater than 1, and their product is 25, possible integer pairs could be (5,5), (25,1) but y needs to be >1, so (25,1) is invalid. So maybe (5,5) is a candidate.

Testing x =5: Then y = x^(10/x) =5^(10/5)=5^2=25. So, y=25. Then xy=5*25=125? Wait, that's not matching with xy=25 as I found earlier. So that must not be correct.

Wait, that's confusing. Because if x=5, then y=25, which gives xy=125, but earlier I thought xy=25. So where did I go wrong?

Let me go back. From the second equation, we had 4y * log_y(x) =10. Since log_y(x) is 1/(log_x(y)), which is 1/a, and a=10/x. So 4y*(x/10)=10, so (4xy)/10=10, which simplifies to 4xy=100, so xy=25. That seems correct.

But then when I substituted, assuming x=5, I get y=25, but that gives xy=125, which doesn't fit. So, that suggests that x=5 is not a solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating y. Let me re-examine the first equation.

The first equation was log_x(y^x)=10. So, using the power rule, that's x*log_x(y)=10. So, log_x(y) =10/x. Therefore, y=x^(10/x). Correct.

If x=5, then y=5^(10/5)=5^2=25, which is correct. But then xy=125, but according to the second equation, xy should be 25. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, x=5 is not a solution.

Hmm, so perhaps x isn't 5. Let's think differently.

We have two equations:

1. y = x^(10/x)
2. xy = 25

So, substituting equation 1 into equation 2, we get x * x^(10/x) =25. So, x^(1 + 10/x) =25.

Let me take natural logs:

(1 + 10/x) * ln(x) = ln(25)

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have a nice algebraic solution. Maybe I can find x by trial and error or by recognizing a pattern.

Let me try x=25. Then y=25^(10/25)=25^(0.4)= (5^2)^(0.4)=5^(0.8). So, y≈5^(0.8). Let me calculate that: ln(5)≈1.609, so 0.8*1.609≈1.287, so e^1.287≈3.6. So, y≈3.6. Then xy=25*3.6≈90, which is greater than 25. Not right.

Wait, so maybe x is less than 25.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can express the equation in terms of a single variable.

Let me let t = x^(1/x). Then, from
