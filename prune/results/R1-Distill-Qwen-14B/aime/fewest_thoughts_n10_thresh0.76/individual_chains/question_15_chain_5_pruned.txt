Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. They also have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

Let me start by visualizing the grid. An 8x8 grid means there are 9 horizontal and 9 vertical lines, right? So, moving from (0,0) to (8,8), which is the lower left to the upper right. Each step on the path can either be right or up. Since the grid is 8x8, the shortest path would consist of 8 rights and 8 ups, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because the problem says the paths are of length 16.

Now, the key part is that the paths change direction exactly four times. I think this means that the path starts by going either right or up, and every time it turns, it switches direction. So, the number of direction changes is related to the number of times the path switches from right to up or vice versa. 

Wait, actually, if a path changes direction four times, how does that relate to the number of segments in the path? Let me think. Each time the direction changes, a new segment starts. For example, if a path goes right for a while, then up, then right again, that's two direction changes but three segments. So, the number of segments is one more than the number of direction changes. So, four direction changes would mean the path is divided into five segments. 

Each segment is a straight line either to the right or upward. Since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), the total right steps must sum to 8, and the total up steps must also sum to 8. Each segment contributes some number of right or up steps.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition the 8 right steps into a certain number of segments and the 8 up steps into another set of segments, such that the total number of direction changes is four. Since direction changes occur when switching between right and up, the number of direction changes is related to how the right and up segments are interleaved.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a sequence of right and up segments. Each direction change alternates between right and up. So, if we have four direction changes, the path alternates directions five times, but that might not be the exact way to model it.

Alternatively, let's think about the path as a sequence of horizontal (right) and vertical (up) moves. Since the path is from (0,0) to (8,8), the total number of right moves is 8 and the total number of up moves is 8. Each time the direction changes, the type of move (right or up) alternates.

So, the number of direction changes is four, meaning that the path has five "runs" or consecutive segments of the same direction. For example, starting with right, then up, then right, then up, then right, then up, then right. Wait, how does that fit with four direction changes?

Wait, perhaps the number of runs is one more than the number of direction changes. So, four direction changes would result in five
