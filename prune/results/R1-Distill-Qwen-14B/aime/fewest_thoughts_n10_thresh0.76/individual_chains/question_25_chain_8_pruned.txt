Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. 

First, the problem states that there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Wait, and then we have some information about how many own exactly two or exactly three of these things. Specifically, 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items, which would be the candy hearts plus the other three. 

Hmm, I think I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. I remember that when dealing with sets and their overlaps, inclusion-exclusion helps to account for the overlaps correctly. But wait, we're dealing with four sets here: candy hearts, diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. But wait, actually, everyone owns a candy heart. So that's a universal set here. Because it says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means every resident is part of the set of candy heart owners. 

Oh, right! So, the four items are: C (candy hearts), D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), and S (garden spade). But since everyone owns C, the problem is about the overlaps between D, G, S, with everyone being part of C. So, when they talk about owning exactly two or three things, does that include the candy hearts? Let me think.

Wait, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the four things a resident can own are C, D, G, S. But since everyone owns C, when we talk about someone owning exactly two things, that could be C and one other, or two others without C. Hmm, but the problem says "exactly two of these things." Wait, which "these things"â€”does it include the candy hearts or not? Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "437 residents who own
