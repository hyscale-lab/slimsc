Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out, for numbers n ≤ 2024, how many of them are such that Bob can guarantee a win no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, so it's a combinatorial game theory problem. These often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Let me think about small n first to see if I can find a pattern.

When n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here, so n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, so if n=2, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Alice? Or is it a losing position for Bob?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The game is that the person who takes the last token wins. So in n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So if Alice takes 1, Bob can win. Alternatively, Alice can take 4, but n=2 <4, so she can't. So in n=2, Alice has to take 1. Bob then takes the last one and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob? Wait, that's not how it works. Wait, no— when n=2, Alice can only take 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So for n=2, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, thus a winning position for Bob. Wait, but I think the terminology is that a position is losing if the current player cannot force a win. So for n=2, Alice is the current player. She can take 1, leaving Bob with n=1, which is a position where Bob can win. Wait, n=1, Alice takes 1 and wins. So if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving Bob with n=1. So Bob, in his turn, can take 1 and win. Therefore, in n=2, Alice can't force a win; Bob can. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, hence a winning position for Bob.

But wait, maybe I should model this as states. Let's define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and false otherwise.

So P(n) is true if the current player can make a move such that the resulting state is false for the opponent. So P(n) = (P(n-1) is false) OR (if n >=4, P(n-4) is false).

Wait, that's correct. Because the current player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. So for each n, current player can choose to move to n-1 or n-4. If either of those positions is a losing position (i.e., P(n-1) is false or P(n-4) is false), then the current player can force the opponent into a losing position, making the current n a winning position.

So let's compute P(n) for small n.

Base cases:
n=0: If there are 0 tokens, the game is over. The player who just moved took the last token and wins, so the current player cannot move. So P(0) is false because the current player can't make a move. So the current player loses.

n=1: The current player can take 1 token, leaving 0 for the opponent, who then loses. So P(1) is true.

n=2: Can the current player win? They can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent in n=1 can take 1 and win. So if current player takes 1, opponent can win. Are there other options? No, because they can't take 4. So the opponent can win, so current player can't. So P(2) is false.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, no, because when n=2, current player takes 1, opponent has n=1, which is a winning position for them. So opponent can win. So current player cannot force a win, so P(2)=false.

Wait, that's different from my initial thought. Hmm.

Wait, let me go through each step carefully.

n=0: Can't make a move, so P(0)=false.

n=1: Take 1, opponent loses. So P(1)=true.

n=2: Can take 1, leading to opponent having n=1, which is a winning position for them. So opponent can win. So P(2)=false.

n=3: Can take 1, leading to n=2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So if you take 1, opponent is at P(2)=false, so you can win. So P(3)=true.

Wait, let me test that.

If n=3, current player takes 1, leaving n=2. For n=2, the opponent can't win (P(2)=false). So current player can force a win. So P(3)=true.

n=4: You can take 4 and win, so P(4)=true.

Alternatively, you can take 1, leaving n=3, which is a winning position for the opponent. So if you take 1, opponent can win. But since you have the option to take 4 and win, you can choose that path. So P(4)=true.

n=5: Current player can take 1, leaving n=4. P(4)=true, so opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for opponent. So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(5)=false.

Wait, so for n=5, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. So P(5)=false.

n=6: Current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (P(5)=false), which is a losing position for the opponent. So current player can win by taking 1. So P(6)=true.

n=7: Current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (P(6)=true) or take 4, leaving n=3 (P(3)=true). So both options lead to opponent having a winning position. So P(7)=false.

n=8: Current player can take 1, leaving n=7 (P(7)=false). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(8)=true.

n=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (P(8)=true). Or take 4, leaving n=5 (P(5)=false). So by taking 4, opponent is in a losing position. So P(9)=true.

Wait, because one of the options (n=5) is a losing position for the opponent. So P(9)=true.

n=10: Take 1, leaving n=9 (P(9)=true), or take 4, leaving n=6 (P(6)=true). Both are winning positions for the opponent. So P(10)=false.

Wait, so P(10)=false.

Wait, let me list these out:

n : P(n)
0 : F
1 : T
2 : F
3 : T
4 : T
5 : F
6 : T
7 : F
8 : T
9 : T
10: F

Hmm, interesting. Let's see if we can find a pattern here.

Looking at the sequence:

n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
P: F T F T T F T F T T F

It seems like the pattern repeats every 5 or 6 steps?

Wait, let me list the P(n) values:

n | P(n)
0 | F
1 | T
2 | F
3 | T
4 | T
5 | F
6 | T
7 | F
8 | T
9 | T
10| F
11| T
12| F
13| T
14| T
15| F
16| T
17| F
18| T
19| T
20| F

Wait, maybe every 5 steps, starting from n=1, it's T, F, T, T, F, then repeats?

Wait, from n=1: T, F, T, T, F; then n=6: T, F, T, T, F; same as n=11: T, F, T, T, F.

So the cycle is 5. So the pattern T, F, T, T, F repeats every 5 numbers.

So let's see:

n mod 5:

n=1: 1 mod5=1 → T

n=2: 2 mod5=2 → F

n=3:3→T

n=4:4→T

n=5:0→F

n=6:1→T

n=7:2→F

n=8:3→T

n=9:4→T

n=10:0→F

Yes, that seems to hold. So the pattern is, for n mod5:

If n mod5 is 0, 2, or 5→ P(n)=F? Wait, n=5 is 0 mod5, which is F.

Wait, let me think again.

Looking at the sequence:

n mod5 | P(n)
0 | F
1 | T
2 | F
3 | T
4 | T

So, for n mod5:

- If remainder is 0: P(n)=F

- If remainder is 1: T

- Remainder 2: F

- Remainder 3: T

- Remainder4: T

Yes, that seems correct.

So for any n, P(n) is false (losing position for the current player) when n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, let me check n=5: 5 mod5=0 → P(n)=F: Correct, because n=5 is a losing position.

n=7:7 mod5=2 → P(n)=F: Correct.

n=10:10 mod5=0→ P(n)=F: Correct.

n=12:12 mod5=2→ P(n)=F: Correct.

So, the losing positions are when n mod5 is 0 or 2.

So, if a player is faced with n tokens where n mod5 is 0 or 2, they cannot win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

But wait, the problem asks for the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's play.

So, if Bob can have a winning strategy, that would mean that for that n, the starting player (Alice) is in a losing position. So, the initial position n must be a losing position for Alice, meaning P(n)=F.

So, n is such that P(n)=F. From above, that's when n mod5 is 0 or 2.

So, in the range n=1 to 2024, how many numbers are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, count the numbers ≤2024 where n mod5=0 or 2.

Let's compute the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 mod5: that's floor(2024/5). Because every 5 numbers contribute one.

Similarly, numbers where n≡2 mod5: same count, except possibly one more if 2024 mod5 is >=2.

Wait, let's compute:

Total numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5) = 404. Since 5×404=2020, and 2024-2020=4.

Numbers ≡2 mod5: Let's see how many. The first number ≡2 mod5 is 2, then 7, 12,... up to ≤2024.

The last number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024 is 2022, since 2022=5×404 +2=2020+2=2022.

So, the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022. This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 2, difference 5, last term 2022.

Number of terms is ((2022-2)/5)+1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.

Similarly, numbers ≡0 mod5: 5,10,...,2020, which is 404 numbers.

Wait, 2020=5×404, so yes, 404 terms.

So total numbers where n≡0 or 2 mod5: 404 +405=809.

But wait, let me double-check.

Number of terms ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404, since 5×404=2020≤2024, and 5×405=2025>2024.

Number of terms ≡2 mod5: floor((2024-2)/5) +1= floor(2022/5)+1=404 +1=405.

So total is 404 +405=809.

Therefore, there are 809 numbers n ≤2024 where n≡0 or 2 mod5, meaning these are losing positions for Alice, so Bob can force a win.

So the answer is 809.


To solve the problem, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of \( n \) tokens, with Alice going first. The player who removes the last token wins. We need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Define Winning and Losing Positions**:
   - A position \( P(n) \) is a **winning position** if the current player can force a win.
   - A position \( P(n) \) is a **losing position** if the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - \( P(0) = \text{False} \): No tokens left, the current player loses.
   - \( P(1) = \text{True} \): Current player takes 1 token and wins.
   - \( P(2) = \text{False} \): Current player takes 1, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who wins.

3. **Recursive Definition**:
   - \( P(n) = \text{True} \) if the current player can move to a losing position for the opponent.
   - Specifically, \( P(n) = \text{True} \) if \( P(n-1) = \text{False} \) or (if \( n \geq 4 \)) \( P(n-4) = \text{False} \).

4. **Pattern Identification**:
   - By computing \( P(n) \) for small values of \( n \), a repeating pattern emerges every 5 numbers:
     \[
     \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
     n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots \\
     \hline
     P(n) & F & T & F & T & T & F & T & F & T & T & F & \dots \\
     \end{array}
     \]
   - The losing positions (where \( P(n) = \text{False} \)) occur when \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).

5. **Counting Losing Positions**:
   - For \( n \leq 2024 \), we count the numbers where \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   - Numbers \( \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).
   - Numbers \( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \): The sequence starts at 2 and ends at 2022. The count is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2022 - 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \).
   - Total losing positions: \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

### Final Answer:
The number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{809}\).
