Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

The product given is over all k from 0 to 12. So, for each k, we're evaluating the expression (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), and then multiplying them all together. Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so let me compute that term first.

For k=0: 2 - 2(1) + (1)^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Hmm, that's just 1. So the first term in the product is 1. So the product is actually from k=1 to 12, because k=0 contributes a 1, which doesn't change the product.

So the problem simplifies to finding the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) modulo 1000.

Now, I need to find a way to compute this product. Maybe I can rewrite the expression inside the product in a more manageable form. Let me look at (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Let me factor out a 2: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me see: Let x = ω^k. Then each term is 2 - 2x + x². That looks like a quadratic: x² - 2x + 2.

So, each term is x² - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k. So the product becomes the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

Wait, but ω^k are the 13th roots of unity except 1, since k goes from 1 to 12. So, in other words, the product is over all x ≠ 1, where x^13 = 1, of (x² - 2x + 2). So, the product is the product of (x² - 2x + 2) for all
