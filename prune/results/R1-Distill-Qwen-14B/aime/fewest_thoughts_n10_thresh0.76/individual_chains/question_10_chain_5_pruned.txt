Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay, so let me break this down. First, let's understand what Bob is doing. For every finite nonempty set B, Bob includes it in his list if and only if the maximum element of B is in A. So, Bob's list is essentially all possible finite nonempty sets where their maximum is a member of A.

Now, the question is, how does the size of Bob's list relate to the set A? And given that the size is 2024, we need to find the sum of elements in A.

Let me think about how many sets B can have a maximum element of a particular number. Suppose the maximum element is m. Then, the other elements in B must be less than m. So, for each m, the number of possible sets B with maximum m is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, right? Because each set B is determined by its elements less than m, and each such set must be non-empty.

Wait, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you fix m as the maximum, the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, but since B must be non-empty, the number of such subsets is 2^{m-1} - 1. Wait, no—because for each m, the subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1} can be empty or non-empty. But since B must be a non-empty set, and the maximum is m, the rest of the elements can be any subset of {1, ..., m-1}, including the empty set. Wait, no, because if you include the empty set, then B would just be {m}, which is allowed because B must be non-empty. So, actually, for each m, the number of sets B with maximum m is 2^{m-1}. Because you can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., m-1} to include along with m. So, if A has elements m₁, m₂, ..., m_k, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each m in A of 2^{m-1}.

Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again. For each m in A, the number of B's with max m is indeed 2^{m-1}, since each such B is a subset of {1, 2, ..., m}, containing m, and the rest are any subsets of the lower numbers. So, if A has elements m₁ < m₂ < ... < m_k, then the total number of sets B is sum_{i=1 to k} 2^{m_i -1}.

But wait, does that make sense? Let's test for a simple case. Suppose A = {1}. Then, the sets B are all non-empty sets where the maximum is 1. That's just the set {1}. So, number of sets is 1. According to the formula, sum is 2^{1-1} = 1. Correct.

Another test: A = {2}. Then, the sets B are all sets where the maximum is 2. These are {2}, {1,2}. So, 2 sets. The formula gives 2^{2-1}=2. Correct.

Another test: A = {1,2}. Then, sets with max 1: {1} (1 set). Sets with max 2: {2}, {1,2} (2 sets). So total sets: 3. Formula: 2^{1-1} + 2^{2-1} = 1 + 2 =3. Correct.

Another test: A = {1,3}. Sets with max 1: {1} (1). Max 3: {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. That's 4 sets. So total is 5. Formula: 2^{0} + 2^{2} = 1 +4=5. Correct.

Okay, so the formula seems to hold. So, the total number of sets B is the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1}.

Given that this total is 2024, we have:

sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

We need to find such a set A where the sum of 2^{m-1} for all m in A equals 2024, and then find the sum of elements in A.

Hmm, so the problem reduces to finding a subset A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{m-1} over m in A is 2024, and then compute the sum of m in A.

Wait, 2024 is a specific number. Let's see what it is in binary because the sum is of powers of 2. 2024 in binary might help us find which exponents are present.

Let me compute 2024 in binary.

2024 divided by 2 is 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2=506, rem 0.

506/2=253, rem 0.

253/2=126 rem1.

126/2=63 rem0.

63/2=31 rem1.

31/2=15 rem1.

15/2=7 rem1.

7/2=3 rem1.
