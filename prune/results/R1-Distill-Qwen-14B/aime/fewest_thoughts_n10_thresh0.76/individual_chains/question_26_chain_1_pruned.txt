Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. The sides are given: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. I need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I remember that the tangent from a point outside a circle has equal lengths. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB and DC should be equal in length. That might come in handy later.

I also recall that points where tangents meet have some nice properties. Specifically, D is called the ex-similicenter of the circle ω with respect to triangle ABC. But maybe that's more advanced than needed here. Let me think of a more basic approach.

I need to find AP. Since P is the intersection of AD with ω, maybe I can use some power of a point theorem or something related to intersecting chords. Wait, power of a point could be useful here.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: since D lies outside the circle and DB and DC are tangents, the power of D is DB² = DC². Also, since AD intersects the circle at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² = DA * DP. So,

DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA, then maybe I can find DP, and then get AP as DA - DP or something. Wait, actually, AP would be the length from A to P, which is along the line AD. So, if I can express DA and DP in terms of AP, that might work.

Wait, let's define variables. Let's let AP = x. Then, since P is on AD, DP = DA + AP? No, wait. Wait, A is on the circle, so when you draw AD, it starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P. So, actually, AD is a secant from D passing through A and P. So, the power of point D is DA * DP = DB².

Wait, no, correction: The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to the square of the tangent, so DB² = DC² = DA * DP. But the order is important here. If AD is extended beyond D to P, then DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. Wait, no, actually, when a secant passes through the circle, the power is equal to the product of the entire secant segment outside the circle and the entire segment. So, in this case, from D, the secant goes through A and P. So, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is from D to P. But A is on the circle, so DA is a tangent? No, A is on the circle, so DA is a secant line that starts at D, passes through A (which is on the circle), and then goes to P (another point on the circle). Wait, but if A is on the circle, then the power of D is DA * DP = DB².

Wait, but DA is from D to A, which is a point on the circle. So, actually, the power of D is DA * DP = DB², where DP is the entire length from D through A to P. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the power of a point theorem accurately.

The power of a point D with respect to circle ω is equal to DB² (since DB is a tangent). If a line through D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then the power is DX * DY. But in our case, the line AD intersects the circle at A
