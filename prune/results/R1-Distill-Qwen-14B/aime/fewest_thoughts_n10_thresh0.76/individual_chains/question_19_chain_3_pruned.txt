Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have triangle ABC. The circumcenter is O, and the incenter is I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, let's recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius (R) is 13, and the inradius (r) is 6. So R = 13, r = 6.

IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a crucial piece of information. So the line segment from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the segment from the incenter I to the circumcenter O.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Yes, I believe that's correct. So OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Plugging in the values, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

So the length of OI is sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. That forms a right angle at I between IA and OI.

Let me try to visualize this. Triangle ABC with incenter I and circumcenter O. IA is one of the angle bisectors, and OI is the line connecting the two centers. IA is perpendicular to OI.

Maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to simplify calculations.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI has length sqrt(13), I can place point O along the x-axis. So O would be at (sqrt(13), 0). Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, so IA must be along the y-axis.

Wait, if I is at (0,0), and O is at (sqrt(13),0), then the vector OI is (sqrt(13), 0). So IA must be along the y-axis because it's perpendicular to OI. So point A must lie somewhere along the y-axis.

Wait, but point A is a vertex of the triangle. So if I is at (0,0) and A is somewhere on the y-axis, say at (0, a), then IA is the line from (0,0) to (0,a), which is along the y-axis.

So O is at (sqrt(13), 0), and I is at (0,0). Hmm, but in reality, the incenter is not necessarily at (0,0), but maybe this coordinate system can help.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or other properties.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use coordinate geometry with I at (0,0) and OI along the x-axis. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, IA is along the y-axis.

So let's set up the coordinate system:

- Let I be at (0,0).
- Let O be at (d, 0), where d = OI = sqrt(13).
- Point A is somewhere along the y-axis, so A is at (0, a) for some a.

Now, since A is a vertex of the triangle, the distances from A to B and C will determine the sides of the triangle. But maybe I can find the sides in terms of the coordinates.

Wait, but perhaps I should recall another formula. The distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.

Alternatively, I know that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = (r)/sin(A/2), where r is the inradius. Similarly, IB = (r)/sin(B/2), and IC = (r)/sin(C/2).

But wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Yes, the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = (r)/sin(A/2). So IA = 6 / sin(A/2).

Similarly, IB = 6 / sin(B/2), IC = 6 / sin(C/2).

Also, I know that in triangle ABC, the circumradius R is related to the sides by the formula a = 2R sin A, where a is the side opposite angle A, which is BC.

Wait, no, actually, in standard notation, a is the side opposite angle A, which is BC, so a = 2R sin A.

Similarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

So, if I can find the angles A, B
