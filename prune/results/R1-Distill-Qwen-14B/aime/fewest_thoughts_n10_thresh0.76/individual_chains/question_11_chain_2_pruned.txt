Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be written in polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can express \( z \) as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier because working with exponentials can sometimes simplify multiplication and division.

So, let me rewrite \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( 1/z \) would be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because \( |1/z| = 1/|z| = 1/4 \) and the argument is the negative of \( z \)'s argument.

Now, substituting \( z \) into the expression, it becomes:
\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]
Simplifying each term, the first term is \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \) and the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) which simplifies to \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So, the expression becomes:
\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
Hmm, maybe I can factor out the 4 from the first term? Let me compute \( 4(75 + 117i) \) first.

Calculating that:
\( 4 \times 75 = 300 \)
\( 4 \times 117 = 468 \)
So, the first term is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

So now the expression is:
\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
Hmm, okay. Now, I know that \( e^{i\theta} \) can be written as \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), and similarly, \( e^{-i\theta} \) is \( \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of sine and cosine.

Let me denote \( A = 300 + 468i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \) for simplicity. Then the expression becomes:
\[
A(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + B(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]
Expanding this, it's:
\[
A\cos\theta + A i \sin\theta + B\cos\theta - B i \sin\theta
\]
Combine like terms:
- The real parts: \( (A + B)\cos\theta \)
- The imaginary parts: \( (A - B)i\sin\theta \)

So, the expression becomes:
\[
(A + B)\cos\theta + (A - B)i\sin\theta
\]
But wait, the original expression is equal to this. So, the entire expression is a complex number with a real part and an imaginary part. However, the problem asks for the largest possible real part. So, I need to find the maximum value of the real part of this expression as \( \theta \) varies.

So, let me compute \( A + B \) and \( A - B \).

First, \( A = 300 + 468i \), \( B = 24 + 36i \).

So, \( A + B = (300 + 24) + (468 + 36)i = 324 + 504i \).

And \( A - B = (300 - 24) + (468 - 36)i = 276 + 432i \).

So now, the expression can be written as:
\[
(324 + 504i)\cos\theta + (276 + 432i)i\sin\theta
\]
Wait, no. Actually, I think I made a mistake in substituting \( A - B \). Let me re-examine:

The expression is \( (A + B)\cos\theta + (A - B)i\sin\theta \).

So, since \( A - B = 276 + 432i \), then \( (A - B)i = (276 + 432i)i = 276i + 432i^2 = 276i - 432 \) because \( i^2 = -1 \).

So, substituting back, the expression becomes:
\[
(324 + 504i)\cos\theta + (276i - 432)\sin\theta
\]
Now, let me separate the real and imaginary parts.

Real parts:
- From the first term: \( 324\cos\theta \)
- From the second term: \( -432\sin\theta \)

So, the total real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Imaginary parts:
- From the first term: \( 504\cos\theta \)
- From the second term: \( 276\sin\theta \)

So, the total imaginary part is \( 504\
