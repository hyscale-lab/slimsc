Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which here is (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. But I'm not sure if that's immediately relevant.

The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So I think that each side of the rectangle must be aligned with a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

Wait, but how do sides and diagonals form rectangles? I need to think about how to form a rectangle inside a regular dodecagon. A rectangle requires four points, with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. Since the dodecagon is regular, the symmetry might help in determining these points.

Maybe I should consider the vertices of the dodecagon. There are 12 vertices, so any four of them could potentially form a rectangle. But not every set of four vertices will form a rectangle. So perhaps the key is to find how many sets of four vertices form a rectangle, where the sides of the rectangle are aligned with the sides or diagonals.

Wait, but actually, the sides of the rectangle must lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So each side of the rectangle must coincide with a side or a diagonal. So the rectangle's sides are either edges of the dodecagon or diagonals connecting two non-adjacent vertices.

But perhaps another approach is to think in terms of selecting two pairs of parallel sides in the dodecagon.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, there are sides and diagonals of different lengths. The sides are the edges, and the diagonals can be of various lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that skips more vertices.

Since a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, each vertex is connected to 9 other vertices via diagonals (since it's connected to itself and its two adjacent vertices via sides; so 12-3=9 diagonals per vertex).

But how do these diagonals and sides form rectangles? Maybe the rectangle is formed by selecting two pairs of parallel sides or diagonals.

Wait, in a regular polygon, sides and certain diagonals are parallel. For example, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, and certain diagonals are also parallel. Similarly, in a dodecagon, there are multiple sets of parallel sides and diagonals.

So to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines: one pair for the length and another for the width of the rectangle. These lines can be sides or diagonals.

Let me think about how many sets of parallel lines are present in a regular dodecagon.

In a regular n-gon, each side has a certain number of parallel sides. For example, in a regular hexagon, each side has one opposite side. In an octagon, each side has another side that's parallel but offset by two vertices.

In a dodecagon, since it's 12-sided, each side has another side that's parallel, but how many sets of parallel sides are there? Let me think.

A regular dodecagon has sides that are spaced every 30 degrees (since 360/12=30). So, a side at 0 degrees will have another side at 180 degrees, which is opposite, so that's one set. But also, because 12 is even, perhaps there are other directions where sides are parallel.

Wait, no. Wait, in a regular 12-gon, each side is separated by 30 degrees. So, the direction of each side is 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°. Now, sides that are 180° apart are parallel. So, for each side, there is another side directly opposite it, which is parallel. So, the number of such sets would be 6, since each set has two sides.

Wait, let's see. 12 sides, each side has one opposite, so 12/2=6 sets. So, there are 6 directions where sides are parallel to each other.

But wait, actually, in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the sides can be grouped into sets where each set contains sides that are parallel. Since each side is 30° apart, the sides that are 180° apart are parallel. So, for each direction, like 0°, 180°, 30°, 210°, etc., each set has
