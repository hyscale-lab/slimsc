Okay, so I've got this problem here about points on a hyperbola forming a rhombus, and I need to find the greatest number less than BD squared for all such rhombuses. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, the hyperbola equation is given as x squared over 20 minus y squared over 24 equals 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x squared.

Now, the problem mentions four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, I think. Wait, actually, no, that's a square. A rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other and are perpendicular, but they aren't necessarily equal in length. So, the diagonals intersect at the origin because the rhombus is centered there. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Given that, each diagonal passes through the origin. So, if I have points A, B, C, D, then the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is a point (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint is (0,0). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q). So, the four points are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).

But wait, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, and so on.

But maybe there's a better way to approach this. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and it's a rhombus, perhaps I can parameterize the points on the hyperbola in terms of some variables.

Let me think. For a hyperbola, points can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. So, maybe points A and C can be represented as (a cosh θ, b sinh θ) and (-a cosh θ, -b sinh θ), where a squared is 20 and b squared is 24. Wait, no, actually, the standard parametrization for hyperbola is (a sec θ, b tan θ), right? Because for hyperbola, using trigonometric functions, but I have to be careful because hyperbola parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions as well.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent points as (x, y) and (-x, -y) for diagonal AC, and similarly (u, v) and (-u, -v) for diagonal BD. Since both pairs of points must lie on the hyperbola, so each of their coordinates must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

But I also need the figure to be a rh
