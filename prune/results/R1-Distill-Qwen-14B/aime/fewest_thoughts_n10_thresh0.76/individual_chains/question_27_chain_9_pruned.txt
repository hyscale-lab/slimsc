Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by revolving a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3 units. The axis is in the plane of the circle and is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6. I remember that the standard equation for a torus involves two radii: the major radius (R), which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis, and the minor radius (r), which is the radius of the generating circle itself.

So in this case, R is 6 and r is 3. Right?

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of S, being internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and it can also rest on the outside, being externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Okay, let me think about the internal and external tangent cases separately.

Starting with the internal tangent: the torus is inside the sphere and touches it along a circle. So, the sphere's surface is outside, and the torus is inside. The point of tangency must lie along a circle where both the sphere and the torus have the same tangent plane. Similarly, for external tangent, the torus is outside the sphere, and they touch along a circle.

I think the key here is to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference. To find these, maybe I can model the torus and sphere in a coordinate system and find the conditions for tangency.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's place the center of the sphere S at the origin (0,0,0). The sphere has radius 11, so any point on its surface satisfies x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, the torus can be placed such that its axis is along the z-axis, but wait, in the problem statement, the axis is in the plane of the circle, which might not necessarily be the same as the z-axis. Hmm, maybe it's better to align the torus's axis along the z-axis for simplicity because the sphere is symmetric.

Wait, no, the torus is generated by revolving a circle around an axis in its plane. So, the major radius is 6, and the minor radius is 3.

The standard parametric equations for a torus are:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ

y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ

z = r sin θ

where θ and φ are angles parameterizing the torus. Here, R is 6, and r is 3.

So, substituting, we get:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ

y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ

z = 3 sin θ

Okay, so any point on the torus is given by these equations.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11, so the maximum distance from the origin to any point on the torus is when the torus point is as far as possible from the origin.

Wait, but in the case of internal tangency, the torus must touch the sphere at exactly one circle. So, the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle of the torus is R, which is 6. So, the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the origin.

Wait, but the generating circle has a radius of 3, so when the torus is inside the sphere, the far
