Okay, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have at least two numbers matching, which means A (winning grand prize) is a subset of B (winning a prize). So, P(A and B) is just P(A). So, I think the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

Let me define the events more clearly. Let A be the event that Jen wins the grand prize, meaning all four of her numbers are chosen. Let B be the event that she wins a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are chosen.

So, we need to find P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

First, I need to compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Then, compute P(B), the probability of winning at least two numbers, and then divide those two.

Let me think about how to compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is 210. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 210.

Calculating P(A): The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways Jen can pick all four numbers that are chosen. Since the winning numbers are fixed (they are the ones randomly chosen), and Jen has to pick exactly those four. Since she picks 4 numbers, there's only 1 way for her to pick all four. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure. The probability that the four numbers she picks are exactly the four chosen. So yes, since both Jen and the lottery are choosing 4 numbers, the probability that they match is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210. That seems correct.

Now, calculating P(B): the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. That is, she could have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers matching. Since she can't have more than four because she only picks four.

So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of her having exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers matching.

Alternatively, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match).

But maybe for clarity, it's better to compute it directly as the sum of exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches.

So, how many ways are there for exactly k matches, where k is 2,3,4.

The number of ways to choose k matching numbers from Jen's 4 is C(4,k). Then, the remaining 4 - k numbers must be chosen from the other numbers not in Jen's set. Since the total set is 10, and Jen has 4, the other numbers are 6. So, the number of ways to choose the remaining 4 - k numbers is C(6,4 - k).

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6, 4 -k).

So, for k=2, it's C(4,2)*C(6,2). For k=3, it's C(4,3)*C(6,1). For k=4, it's C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Calculating each:

For k=2:

C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. So, 6*15=90.

For k=3:

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.

For k=4:

C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1. So, 1*1=1.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes for B is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, total number of ways is 210, and favorable is 115. So, P(B) = 115/210.

Simplify 115/210. 115 divides by 5: 23. 210 divided by 5 is 42. So
