Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending segments AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, first, let me visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all sides equal in angles, just all sides equal in length and opposite sides parallel. Interesting.

I remember that in such hexagons, they can be thought of as being formed by translating each side by the same distance and direction, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

The triangle mentioned is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Since these are sides of the hexagon, their extensions must meet at some points forming a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate this triangle to the side length of the hexagon.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as having three pairs of opposite sides, each pair being parallel and equal in length.

Wait, no. In an equilateral hexagon, all sides are equal, but opposite sides are not necessarily equal in terms of length, but wait, no, no, wait. Wait, the problem says it's a convex equilateral hexagon. So, all sides are equal, but opposite sides are parallel. So, each side is length 's', opposite sides are parallel.

So, in such a hexagon, the consecutive sides are not necessarily at 120-degree angles as in a regular hexagon. Instead, the angles can vary, but opposite sides remain parallel.

Now, when you extend AB, CD, and EF, you form a triangle. Let me think about how that triangle is related to the hexagon.

Perhaps I can model the hexagon as being inside this triangle, with each pair of opposite sides contributing to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of similar triangles or affine transformations. Since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, each side is like a translation of its opposite.

Another approach: maybe the triangle is similar to the hexagon's "
