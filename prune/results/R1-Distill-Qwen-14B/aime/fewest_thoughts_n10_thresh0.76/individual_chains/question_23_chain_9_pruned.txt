Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral where all four sides are of equal length. Also, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, no, I think they are. Let me confirm. No, scratch that, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, I think that's correct. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense.

So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint for both diagonals.

Given that, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Also, since the origin is the midpoint, for point A (x, y), point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, for point B (p, q), point D would be (-p, -q).

But since all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation.

So, the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Therefore, for point A, (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1, and similarly for point B, (p²)/20 - (q²)/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the properties of the rhombus in terms of vectors. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the origin is the midpoint, maybe we can represent the points as vectors from the origin.

Let me denote vectors a = OA, b = OB, c = OC, d = OD. Since C is the opposite of A, vector c = -a, and similarly d = -b.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are vectors a + b and a - b? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a rhombus, the sides can be represented as vectors a and b, so the diagonals would be a + b and a - b.
