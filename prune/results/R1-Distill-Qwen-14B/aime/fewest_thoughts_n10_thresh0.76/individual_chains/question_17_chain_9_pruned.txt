Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then compute p+q. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let me break it down.

First, let me note down the given information. For a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54, and the volume V is lwh = 23, where l, w, h are the length, width, and height of the box.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere must encompass all possible boxes in B. So, the sphere's diameter is going to be the maximum distance across the box, which would be the space diagonal of the box.

The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(l² + w² + h²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that: r = d/2 = (1/2) * sqrt(l² + w² + h²).

So, to minimize the sphere, I need to minimize the space diagonal, which in turn minimizes r. Wait, but since the sphere must contain every box in B, I think I actually need the maximum space diagonal across all boxes in B. Because if one box has a larger space diagonal, the sphere needs to be big enough to contain it. So, I need to find the maximum possible value of sqrt(l² + w² + h²) given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing l² + w² + h² subject to the constraints 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for the largest possible space diagonal, the sphere needs to have a radius that can cover that. So, I need to maximize l² + w² + h².

Let me denote x = l, y = w, z = h for simplicity.

So, we have:

2(xy + xz + yz) = 54 => xy + xz + yz = 27.

And,

xyz = 23.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

I remember that in algebra, for three variables, x² + y² + z² can be expressed in terms of (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz). From that, since xy + yz + xz is 27, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize (x + y + z)^2, because 54 is a constant. Therefore, maximizing x + y + z will maximize x² + y² + z².

So, the problem now becomes, given that xyz = 23 and xy + xz + yz = 27, find the maximum possible value of (x + y + z)^2.

Hmm, how do I approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? Or perhaps some inequality like AM ≥ GM?

Wait, but since I have two equations, maybe I can express x + y + z in terms of the given constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for three variables, the maximum of x + y + z given fixed xy + yz + zx and xyz is achieved when two variables are equal? Or maybe when one variable is as large as possible, and the others adjust accordingly.

Wait, let me think about this. Let me try to use Lagrange multipliers.

Define the function to maximize: f(x,y,z) = x + y + z.

Subject to constraints:

g(x,y,z) = xy + xz + yz - 27 = 0,

h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, I can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x + y + z - λ(xy + xz + yz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23).

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 1 - λ(y + z) - μ yz = 0,

∂L/∂y = 1 - λ(x + z) - μ xz = 0,

∂L/∂z = 1 - λ(x + y) - μ xy = 0.

And the constraints:

xy + xz + yz = 27,

xyz = 23.

So, now, from the partial derivatives:

1 = λ(y + z) + μ yz,

1 = λ(x + z) + μ xz,

1 = λ(x + y) + μ xy.

So, we have three equations:

1) λ(y + z) + μ yz = 1,

2) λ(x + z) + μ xz = 1,

3) λ(x + y) + μ xy = 1.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

λ(x + z - y - z) + μ (xz - yz) = 0,

Which simplifies to λ(x - y) + μ z(x - y) = 0.

Factor out (x - y):

(λ + μ z)(x - y) = 0.

So, either x = y, or λ + μ z = 0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 from equation 3:

λ(x + y - y - z) + μ (xy - yz) = 0,

Simplifies to λ(x - z) + μ y(x - z) = 0.

Factor out (x - z):

(λ + μ y)(x - z) = 0.

So, either x = z, or λ + μ y = 0.

Same for subtracting equation 2 from equation 3:

λ(x + y - x - z) + μ (xy - xz) = 0,

Which is λ(y - z) + μ x(y - z) = 0,

Factor out (y - z):

(λ + μ x)(y - z) = 0.

So, either y = z, or λ + μ x = 0.

So, from these, we have possibilities. If x ≠ y, then λ + μ z = 0. Similarly, if x ≠ z, then λ + μ y = 0, and if y ≠ z, then λ + μ x = 0.

But if, say, x = y = z, then all variables are equal. Let me check if that's possible.

Suppose x = y = z. Then, the surface area is 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. But then the volume would be x³ = 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube with x = y = z = 3 has volume 27, which is larger than 23. So, that's not possible. Therefore, x, y, z cannot all be equal.

Alternatively, perhaps two variables are
