Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The question specifies that these paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has points from (0,0) to (8,8). So, moving from (0,0) to (8,8), each path consists of a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. Each path is a permutation of 8 R's and 8 U's. The total number of such paths without any constraints is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But we're only interested in those paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Let me think. A path changes direction when it switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, each time the path alternates between R and U segments, it's changing direction. For example, a path that goes all the way right first, then all the way up, changes direction once. Similarly, a path that alternates every step (R, U, R, U, etc.) would change direction 15 times, which is the maximum.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that work? Let me consider how directions can be grouped. Each time the direction changes, a new segment starts. So, if there are four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments. Each segment is either a sequence of R's or U's.

Wait, but how do these segments alternate? Let me think. If the first segment is R, the next must be U, then R, then U, etc. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the path alternates between R and U.

So, for four direction changes, the path will have five segments. These segments alternate between R and U. The first segment could be R or U, so there are two cases: starting with R or starting with U.

Let me take an example. Suppose a path starts with R, then changes to U, then R, then U, then R. That's four direction changes, resulting in five segments: R, U, R, U, R. Similarly, if it starts with U, the segments would be U, R, U, R, U.

Wait, but in each case, how many R's and U's do we have? Since the total number of R's is 8 and the total number of U's is 8.

Let me formalize this. Let's suppose the path starts with R. Then the segments alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, the number of R segments is 3, and U segments is 2? Wait, no, wait. The number of segments is 5, so if starting with R, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. So, 3 R segments and 2 U segments. Similarly, if starting with U, it would be
