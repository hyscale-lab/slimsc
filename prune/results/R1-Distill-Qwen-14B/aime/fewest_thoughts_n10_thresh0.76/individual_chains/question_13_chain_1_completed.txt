Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She sometimes walks at a speed of 's' km/h and other times at 's + 2' km/h. Each walk includes a stop at a coffee shop where she spends 't' minutes. The problem gives me two scenarios: one where she walks at speed 's' and takes 4 hours in total, and another where she walks faster, at 's + 2' km/h, and takes 2 hours and 24 minutes. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I can set up some equations based on the given information. 

In the first scenario, her walking speed is 's' km/h, and the total time taken is 4 hours, which includes both the walking time and the coffee stop time 't' minutes. Similarly, when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including 't' minutes.

Wait, but time is given in hours and minutes in the second scenario. Maybe it's better to convert everything into hours or minutes. Let me think. Since walking speed is in km/h, perhaps it's better to convert 't' into hours.

So, let's start by converting all times into hours. 

In the first case, total time is 4 hours. So, the walking time plus coffee time equals 4 hours. The walking time at speed 's' is distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours. The coffee time is 't' minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 't' minutes is t/60 hours. So, equation one is:

9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, in the second scenario, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours in total. The walking time here is 9/(s + 2) hours, plus the coffee time 't/60' hours. So equation two is:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now, I have two equations:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I need to solve these equations to find 's' and 't'. Once I have those, I can compute the time when her speed is 's + 1/2' km/h.

Let me subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 't'. 

So, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the difference inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, substituting back:

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Simplify numerator:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Now, solve for s(s + 2):

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Calculate 18 / 1.6: 1.6 is 8/5, so 18 * (5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

This is a quadratic equation:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let's solve for 's'. Using quadratic formula:

s = [ -2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) ) ] / (2*1)

Compute discriminant:

4 + 45 = 49

So sqrt(49) is 7.

Thus, s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:

s = (5)/2 = 2.5 km/h

s = (-9)/2 = -4.5 km/h

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Now that I have s = 2.5, I can find 't' using one of the equations. Let's use equation 1:

9/s + t/60 = 4

Plugging in s = 2.5:

9/2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So, 3.6 + t/60 = 4

Subtract 3.6:

t/60 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 24 minutes.

Okay, so now I know that Aya spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop every time.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how much time does she take, including the coffee time.

s is 2.5, so s + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So her walking speed is 3 km/h. The distance is still 9 km.

Time taken walking is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Adding the coffee time: 3 hours + 24 minutes.

But wait, the question says to include the t minutes in the total time. So, 3 hours is 180 minutes. Adding 24 minutes gives 204 minutes.

Wait, wait, but let me double-check. The walk time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes at the coffee shop, totaling 204 minutes.

So the total time is 204 minutes.

Wait, but maybe I should represent it in hours and minutes as well? The problem just asks for the number of minutes, including t, so 204 minutes is correct.


Aya's walking speed is initially \( s = 2.5 \) km/h, and she spends \( t = 24 \) minutes at the coffee shop. When she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours (180 minutes). Adding the coffee shop time of 24 minutes gives a total of \( 180 + 24 = 204 \) minutes.

The total time Aya takes, including the coffee shop, when walking at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
