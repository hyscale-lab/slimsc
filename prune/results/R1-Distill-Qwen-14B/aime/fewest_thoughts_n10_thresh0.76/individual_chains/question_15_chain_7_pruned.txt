Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that in grid paths, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, to get from the lower left to the upper right, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of rights (R) and ups (U), with 8 of each.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, each time the path changes from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change. For example, if a path is RRRUUURRUUURRUU, that would have several direction changes... Let me count. Starting with R, then to U, then back to R, then U again... Hmm, each switch is a change.

So, how does the number of direction changes relate to the structure of the path? Well, each time the direction changes, it's like a new segment of the path. So, for four direction changes, the path would have five segments. Because each change adds a new segment. Like, one direction change would split the path into two segments, two direction changes into three segments, etc. So for four direction changes, we have five segments.

Wait, so the path is made up of five segments, each of which is either all R's or all U's. Now, the total steps are 16, with 8 R's and 8 U's. So, we need to distribute the 8 R's into some of the five segments, and the 8 U's into the remaining segments.

But wait, we have to think about how many R segments and U segments there are. Each time the path changes direction, it alternates between R and U. So, starting with R, the directions would be R, U, R, U, etc. So, the number of R segments and U segments depends on whether the path starts with R or U.

If it starts with R, then the segments alternate R, U, R, U, etc. Since there are five segments, the number of R segments would be three and the number of U segments would be two. Or
