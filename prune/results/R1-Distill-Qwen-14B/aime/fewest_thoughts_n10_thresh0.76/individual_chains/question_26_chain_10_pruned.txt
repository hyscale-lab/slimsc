Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of AP in triangle ABC. Let me try to visualize what's given. Triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω, which means it's the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. The sides of the triangle are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n, and then compute m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should probably draw a diagram to get a better idea. But since I don't have paper right now, I'll try to imagine it. So, triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω passes through all three points. The tangents at B and C meet at D. AD meets ω again at P, and I need to find AP.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, those tangents are equal in length. So, in this case, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB must be equal to DC. That's because both DB and DC are tangents from D to ω.

Wait, is that right? Yes, because the lengths of tangents from a single external point to a circle are equal. So, DB = DC.

I think I can use properties of power of a point here. The power of point D with respect to ω should be DB^2, since DB is the tangent from D to ω. Similarly, the power of D is also equal to DC^2, but since DB = DC, that makes sense.

But how does that help me relate to AD and point P? Because AD intersects the circle again at P, so maybe I can apply the power of point A with respect to ω. Wait, no, A is on ω, so its power is zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider using power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D is DB^2 = DC^2, and since AD passes through the circle at A and P, the power of D is also equal to DA * DP. So, that gives me the equation DB^2 = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, and DA, then I can find DP, and then since AP = DP - DA, or is it DA + DP? Wait, no, because P is on AD beyond A? Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Wait, point D is outside the circle, right? Because it's the intersection of two tangents. So, point D is outside ω, and line AD passes through A (which is on ω) and then intersects ω again at P. So, the order is D, then A, then P. So, DA is from D to A, and then DP is from D to P. So, DA is a segment, and DP is another segment, but actually, DP
