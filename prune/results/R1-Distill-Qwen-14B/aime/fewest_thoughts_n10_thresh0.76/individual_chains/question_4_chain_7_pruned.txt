Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. Since both players can remove 1 or 4 tokens each turn, the game outcome depends on the number of tokens and the strategies each player uses. The key here is to figure out the winning and losing positions.

A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of the opponent's moves. Conversely, a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Let me try to model this. Let's define a position as "winning" if the current player can force a win from that position, and "losing" otherwise. We'll analyze small values of n to find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes that 1 and wins. Wait, no, wait. If n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob who then takes it and wins. So Bob wins. Or, if n=2, Alice can take 1, but Bob can win. Alternatively, does Alice have another option? She can't take 4 from n=2, so she must take 1. So Bob wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, in n=2, if Alice takes 1, then n becomes 1, Bob's turn. Bob can take 1 and win. So Alice cannot force Bob to lose here. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is, which in this case is Alice. So Bob can win.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the starting player. So a position is losing if the current player can't force a win.

So let's re-express:

For each n
