Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable. So, I can't tell one white chip from another, same with black. I need to place some of these chips in the 25 cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. 

The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Also, any additional chip I try to place would violate one of the previous two conditions. So, the arrangement must already be maximal in some sense—meaning it can't have any more chips without breaking the row or column color rules.

Hmm, so each row must be entirely white, entirely black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column must be entirely white, entirely black, or have no chips. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. The condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color. Similarly for the columns.

Wait a second, that's a key point. So, if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color, but the row can have zero chips. Similarly for columns. So, the entire grid's chip placement is such that each row is monochromatic (if it has any chips), and each column is monochromatic (if it has any chips). 

But then, the problem says that any additional chip would violate these conditions. So, the current arrangement is such that every empty cell is such that placing a chip there would either make the row have mixed colors or the column have mixed colors.

Wait, but how can that happen? Let me think. So, if I have a particular cell that's empty, and I try to place a chip there. For that cell, its row already has some chips, and the column already has some chips. So, if I place a white chip there, the row must already have all white chips, otherwise it's a violation. Similarly, if I place a black chip, the row must already have all black chips. But the same applies to the column—if the column already has some chips, they must be the same color as the one I'm trying to place.

But wait, since we have 25 white and
