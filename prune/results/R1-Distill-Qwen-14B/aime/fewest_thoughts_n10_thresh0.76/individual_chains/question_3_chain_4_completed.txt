Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have at least two numbers matching, so A is a subset of B. That means P(A and B) is just P(A). Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and P(B), the probability that she wins at least two numbers. Then, divide them and simplify the fraction to get m/n, then add m and n.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways the lottery can be drawn. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4), right? Let me calculate that. C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, 210 possible combinations.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she picks 4 numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is just 1 (the specific combination she picked). So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, hold on. Is that right? Because when she picks her 4 numbers, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers. So, the probability that all four match is indeed 1/210, because there's only one favorable combination.

Now, moving on to P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. So, she wins a prize if she has exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers matching the lottery numbers.

So, to compute P(B), I can calculate the probability for exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 matches, and then sum them up.

Alternatively, it's sometimes easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of at least two matches is having fewer than two matches, which is either 0 or 1 match. So, maybe that's easier.

Let me consider that approach. So, P(B) = 1 - P(no matches) - P(exactly 1 match).

Yes, that should work.

So, let's compute P(no matches) and P(exactly 1 match).

First, P(no matches): the number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers none of which are in Jen's 4 numbers. Since Jen has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't pick. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). So, C(6,4) = 15. So, the number of ways with no matches is 15. So, P(no matches) = 15 / 210.

Next, P(exactly 1 match): the number of ways to choose exactly 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,1)*C(6,3). Let me compute that. C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, P(exactly 1 match) is 80 / 210.

So, putting it together, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210. Let's compute 95/210. Dividing numerator and denominator by 5, we get 19/42. So, 1 - 19/42 is (42/42 - 19/42) = 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, let me check that again. So, 15 + 80 is 95, right? So, 95/210 is 19/42. So, 1 - 19/42 is 23/42. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I could have directly calculated P(B) by adding up the probabilities for exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches, but it's the same thing. Let me just verify quickly:

Number of ways for exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). That's 6 * 15 = 90. So, 90/210.

Number of ways for exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1). That's 4 * 6 = 24. 24/210.

Number of ways for exactly 4 matches: 1, as before. So, 1/210.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. 115/210. Simplify that, divide numerator and denominator by 5: 23/42. Oh, same result as before. So, that's a good check. So, P(B) is indeed 23/42.

Earlier, I thought P(A) is 1/210. But wait, in the context of P(A|B), do I need to adjust anything? Let me think.

Wait, no. Because P(A) is the probability that all four are chosen, which is 1/210. And P(B) is 23/42, which is 115/210. So, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (23/42). Let me compute that.

First, let's express both fractions with the same denominator. 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). Simplify 42/210: that's 1/5. So, it becomes (1/5) / 23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, so P(A|B) is 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, because 115 is 5*23, and 1 is coprime with everything. So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (42/210) * (1/23) = (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/115. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the counts instead of probabilities. Maybe that can help.

So, the total number of favorable cases for B is 115 (since 95/210 is the complement, so 210 - 95 = 115). So, the number of ways she can win a prize is 115.

The number of ways she can win the grand prize is 1.

Thus, the conditional probability is 1 / 115, which is 1/115. So, same as before.

Hence, the probability is 1/115, so m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

But wait, let me think again. Is this correct? Because when we compute the conditional probability, we're looking at the probability that all four match, given that at least two match.

But in probability terms, it's (number of grand prize outcomes) divided by (number of prize outcomes), which is 1 / 115. So, yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the count of prize outcomes. So, the number of ways she can have at least two matches is 115, as we computed earlier. So, 115 possible lottery combinations where she has at least two matches with her numbers. So, the conditional probability is 1/115.

Therefore, the answer is 1 + 115 = 116.

I think that's solid. I cross-checked using two methods: calculating probabilities and then conditional probability, and also by thinking in terms of counts.

So, I believe the answer is 116.


Jen participates in a lottery where she selects 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \), and Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

The probability of winning the grand prize \( P(A) \) is:
\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

Next, calculate the probability of winning a prize \( P(B) \). This is the probability of having at least two matches. Instead of calculating this directly, compute the complement (having fewer than two matches) and subtract from 1.

- **No matches**: Choose 4 numbers from the 6 Jen did not pick:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(\text{no matches}) = \frac{15}{210}
\]

- **Exactly one match**: Choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \cdot \binom{6}{3} = 4 \cdot 20 = 80 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(\text{exactly one match}) = \frac{80}{210}
\]

Thus, the probability of not winning a prize:
\[
P(\text{no prize}) = \frac{15 + 80}{210} = \frac{95}{210} = \frac{19}{42}
\]

Therefore, the probability of winning a prize:
\[
P(B) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \cdot \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Thus, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), so \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
