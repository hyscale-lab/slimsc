Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem. Let me read it again and understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I find that prime p, the next step is to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I think I should start by understanding when p² divides n⁴ + 1. That would mean that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, for some n, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that for primes p, n^k ≡ -1 mod p has solutions only under certain conditions. Maybe I can use some number theory concepts here.

First, let me consider primes p where the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Because if there's a solution mod p, maybe it can be lifted to a solution mod p² using Hensel's lemma or something like that.

But wait, before that, I should figure out which primes p allow x^4 ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution. I think this relates to the order of x modulo p. Specifically, the order of x modulo p would divide 8 because x^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So, the multiplicative order of x modulo p must divide 8, but since x^4 ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4 because (-1)^2 = 1. So the order must be 8.

Therefore, 8 must divide p - 1, because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, so 8 divides p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but are there any other primes where x^4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution? Let's think. For p=2, let's see: n⁴ +1 mod 4. If n is odd, n ≡ 1 or 3 mod 4, so n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 4, so n⁴ +1 ≡ 2 mod 4, which isn't divisible by 4. If n is even, n⁴ is 0 mod 4, so n⁴ +1 ≡ 1 mod 4. So, for p=2, p²=4 divides n⁴ +1 only if n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 4. But as we saw, for n even, it's 1 mod 4, and for n odd, it's 2 mod 4. So 4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's check if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod 3. Since mod 3, the possible residues are 0,1,2. n^4 mod 3: 0^4=0, 1^4=1, 2^4=16≡1 mod 3. So n⁴ can only be 0 or 1 mod 3. So -1≡2 mod 3 isn't achieved. So p=3 is out.

p=5: Let's see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5. The possible n mod 5 are 0,1,2,3,4.

Compute n⁴ mod 5:

0^4=0

1^4=1

2^4=16≡1

3^4=81≡1

4^4=256≡1

So n⁴ mod 5 is either 0 or 1. So 1≡-1 mod 5 would mean 1≡4 mod5, which is not the case. So p=5 is out.

p=7: Let's see if n⁴ ≡-1 mod7. n can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Compute n⁴ mod7:

0^4=0

1^4=1

2^4=16≡2

3^4=81≡4

4^4=256≡256-36*7=256-252=4 mod7

5^4=625. Let's compute 5^2=25≡4, so 5^4=4^2=16≡2 mod7.

6^4: 6≡-1 mod7, so (-1)^4=1.

So n⁴ mod7 can be 0,1,2,4. -1 mod7 is 6. So none of these are 6. So p=7 is out.

p=11: Let me compute n⁴ mod11.
