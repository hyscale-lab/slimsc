Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. Similarly for EFGH.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, I imagine that points D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are adjacent corners of rectangle EFGH. So, the line DC (or EF) is where these four points lie.

Wait, but ABCD is a rectangle, so BC is one of its sides. BC is given as 16, so that would be the height of the rectangle, right? Because in a rectangle, the sides are length and width. AB is given as 107, so AB must be the length of the base of rectangle ABCD. So, ABCD has sides AB=107 and BC=16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG=17 and EF=184. So, EF is the base of EFGH with length 184, and FG is the height with length 17.

Now, since D, E, C, F are collinear, I think the line DC is the same as EF. But wait, DC is a side of rectangle ABCD, and EF is a side of EFGH. So, DC is of length BC=16? Wait, no. Wait, DC is a side of ABCD. In rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal. So, AB is length 107, so CD is also 107. Because ABCD is a rectangle, AB is opposite to CD, so CD = AB = 107.

Wait, but EF is a side of EFGH
