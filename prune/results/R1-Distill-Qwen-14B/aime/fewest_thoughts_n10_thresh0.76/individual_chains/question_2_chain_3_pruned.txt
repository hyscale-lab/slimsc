Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), which is the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is a point on the y-axis. So, point A is on the x-axis, point B is on the y-axis, and O is the origin. 

Then, there's this family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So for each such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), and the distance between P and Q is 1. That means sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. So all these segments are like lines from the x-axis to the y-axis, each of length 1, in the first quadrant. 

Now, the problem says that there is a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that does not lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. So AB is part of F, right? Because AB is a segment from A on the x-axis to B on the y-axis. Let me check: the distance from A to B. A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So distance AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is indeed a segment of F. 

So AB is one of these segments PQ. Now, we're looking for a point C on AB, not A or B, such that C is not on any other segment from F. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C doesn't lie on them. So, AB is one of the F-segments, but C is only on AB and no other F-segment. 

We need to find OC², where O is the origin, and then express it as p/q with p and q coprime, and find p + q. 

Alright, so first, let's find the equation of AB. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the line AB can be parametrized. Let me find its equation.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, and x is between 0 and 1/2.

But wait, AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), so x goes from 0 to 1/2. So, when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. When x=1/2, y=0, which is point A.

So, any point C on AB is (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) with x in [0, 1/2].

Now, the key is to find such a point C that does not lie on any other F-segment PQ, except AB.

So, for point C, suppose there exists another segment PQ in F, different from AB, such that C lies on PQ. We need to show that such a point C is unique and find it.

Wait, but the problem says that there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other F-segment. So, except for AB, C is not on any other PQ in F. So, we need to find C such that it's on AB, but for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of it as the point C where AB is the only F-segment that passes through it. So, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, to find such a point, perhaps we can parameterize all the F-segments and find conditions when a point C on AB is not on any other F-segment.

Alternatively, perhaps to find the envelope of all these segments PQ and see where AB intersects it, except at A and B.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope of all these segments PQ would form a curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, think about the condition for a point (x, y) to lie on a segment PQ. So, PQ is a segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1. The equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, because it's the intercept form of the line.

So, any point on PQ satisfies x/p + y/q = 1.

So, for a point (x, y), if there are p and q such that x/p + y/q = 1 and p² + q² = 1, then the point (x, y) lies on PQ.

So, for point C on AB, which is (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). We need to ensure that there do not exist p and q with p² + q² = 1, and x/p + y/q = 1, except when PQ is AB itself.

So, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the equation x/p + y/q = 1, we get:

x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.

And since p² + q² = 1, we can think of this as a system of equations in p and q. 

We need to find if there exists (p, q) ≠ (1/2, sqrt(3)/2) such that the above equation holds, and p² + q² =1.

If such (p, q) exists, then C lies on another PQ. So, to have C not lie on any other PQ, such (p, q) should not exist.

So, our goal is to find C on AB such that the only solution is (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, let's set up the equations.

Let me denote x as the x-coordinate of C, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Equation 1: x/p + y/q = 1.

Equation 2: p² + q² = 1.

We need to find p and q such that these two equations are satisfied.

We can attempt to solve for p and q in terms of x.

Let me rearrange equation 1: x/p + y/q = 1.

Multiply both sides by pq: x q + y p = pq.

So, x q + y p = p q.

Rearranged: x q + y p - p q = 0.

We can factor this as: q(x - p) + y p = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe express q from equation 1 in terms of p, and substitute into equation 2.

From equation 1: x/p + y/q = 1 => (x q + y p)/ (p q) ) = 1 => x q + y p = p q.

So, x q = p q - y p => x q = p (q - y) => q = [p (q - y)] / x.

Wait, that might not be helpful. Let me think differently.

Express equation 1 as: x/p + y/q =1.

We can write this as: (x q + y p)/(p q) =1 => x q + y p = p q.

So, x q + y p = p q.

Let me rearrange this as: y p = p q - x q => y p = q (p - x).

So, y p = q (p - x).

We can write this as: q = (y p)/(p - x).

Now, substitute this into equation 2: p² + q² =1.

So, q = (y p)/(p - x), so q² = (y² p²)/(p - x)^2.

So, equation 2 becomes:

p² + (y² p²)/(p - x)^2 = 1.

Let me factor out p²:

p² [1 + (y²)/(p - x)^2] =1.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can write it as:

p² [ ( (p - x)^2 + y² ) / (p - x)^2 ) ] =1.

So,

p² ( (p - x)^2 + y² ) / (p - x)^2 =1.

Multiply both sides by (p - x)^2:

p² [ (p - x)^2 + y² ] = (p - x)^2.

Let me bring everything to one side:

p² [ (p - x)^2 + y² ] - (p - x)^2 = 0.

Factor out (p - x)^2:

(p - x)^2 (p² -1) + p² y² =0.

Wait, let me expand p² [ (p - x)^2 + y² ]:

= p² (p - x)^2 + p² y².

So, equation becomes:

p² (p -x)^2 + p² y² - (p -x)^2 =0.

Factor out (p -x)^2:

(p -x)^2 (p² -1) + p² y
