Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including some time t spent in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes again.

Hmm, let me break it down. First, I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. Since the distance is constant at 9 km, I can set up equations based on the two different speeds given.

In the first scenario, she walks at a speed of s km/h and it takes her 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, but 4 hours includes both walking and the coffee stop. Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at s+2 km/h and it takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, but again including t minutes.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the time given includes t minutes. So, the total time is the walking time plus t minutes. But I need to make sure I convert everything into the same units. Let's convert t into hours or minutes. Maybe minutes would be easier since the answer is required in minutes.

So, first scenario: walking speed s km/h, total time including coffee is 4 hours. So, 4 hours is equal to the walking time plus t minutes. But 4 hours is 240 minutes. Similarly, the second scenario is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes.

Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me think again. Wait, the walk takes 4 hours including t minutes. So, the total time is 4 hours, which includes both the time she spends walking and the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me read the problem again.

"When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop."

So, "the walk takes her 4 hours" meaning the total time from start to finish, which includes walking time plus coffee time.

Similarly, the second scenario: "the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes, again including t minutes.

Okay, so in both cases, the total time is the walking time plus t. So, if I can find the walking time (without the coffee stop) for each scenario, I can set up equations.

For the first scenario:
Total time = walking time + t
4 hours is 240 minutes. So, 240 = walking_time1 + t.

Walking_time1 is the time she spends walking at speed s. Since distance = speed * time, time = distance / speed. So, walking_time1 = 9 / s hours. Wait, but I have to convert that into minutes because the total time is in minutes. Wait, no, maybe it's easier to convert everything into hours.

Wait, let me see. If I use hours, then:

First scenario:
Total time = (walking time in hours) + (t in hours) = 4 hours.

Walking time = 9 / s hours.

So, 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Wait, because t is in minutes, so to convert t minutes into hours, I divide by 60.

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Speed is s + 2 km/h, walking time is 9/(s+2) hours, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

So, 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4

2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, okay. Now, I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

So, equation 1 minus equation 2:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Factor out 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

= (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) ) = 2/(s(s + 2)).

So,

9 * [2/(s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Simplify:

18 / (s(s + 2)) = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Divide both sides by 1.6:

18 / 1.6 = s(s + 2)

18 divided by 1.6 is... Let me compute that.

1.6 is 8/5, so 18 divided by (8/5) is 18 * (5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25.

So,

s(s + 2) = 11.25

Expand:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

So, quadratic equation: s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me solve for s using quadratic formula.

s = [-2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 -4*1*(-11.25) ) ] / (2*1)

Compute discriminant:

= 4 + 45 = 49

sqrt(49) is 7.

So,

s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

We can ignore the negative solution because speed can't be negative.

So,

s = ( -2 +7 ) /2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

Wait, that can't be right because if s is 2.5, then s + 2 is 4.5, then her walking time would be 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours. Plus t minutes. Hmm, let's check.

Wait, the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 = 4.5 km/h, which would take 2 hours. So, total time including t is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours.

So, 2 hours + t = 2.4 hours.

So, t = 0.4 hours, which is 24 minutes. That makes sense.

Now, going back to the first scenario, walking speed is 2.5 km/h. Walking time is 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours 36 minutes. Then, total time is 4 hours, so 3h36m + t = 4h. So, t is 24 minutes, which matches. Okay, so s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h. So, her walking speed is 3 km/h.

Compute the walking time: 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours. So, walking time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.

Including t minutes, which is 24 minutes, the total time is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm:

If s=2.5, then s + 1/2 is 3 km/h, correct.

Time walking is 9 / 3 = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.

Plus t=24 minutes, so 204 minutes total.

Yes, that seems right.

But let me double-check my steps, just in case.

First, I set up the two equations based on the given scenarios.

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, got 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6.

Then, simplified to 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6, which gave s(s+2)=11.25.

Solving quadratic equation, s=2.5.

Then found t by using equation 2: 9/(4.5) + t/60 = 2.4 → 2 + t/60 = 2.4 → t=24.

So, when walking at 3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, 180 minutes, plus t=24, total 204 minutes.

Yes, I think that's correct.


To solve the problem, we start by setting up equations based on the given scenarios. Let \( s \) be Aya's walking speed in km/h and \( t \) be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes. 

### Step 1: Set up the equations
1. When walking at \( s \) km/h, the total time including the coffee stop is 4 hours (240 minutes):
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]
2. When walking at \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time including the coffee stop is 2 hours and 24 minutes (144 minutes):
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
   \]

### Step 2: Subtract the equations to eliminate \( t \)
Subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]
Simplifying:
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
s(s + 2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
\]

### Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation
The quadratic equation is:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(-11.25)}}{2(1)}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
Taking the positive root:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]

### Step 4: Find \( t \)
Using the second scenario:
\[
\frac{9}{4.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]
\[
2 + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total time at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h
When walking at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:
\[
\text{Walking time} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{minutes}
\]
Including the coffee stop:
\[
\text{Total time} = 180 + 24 = 204 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
\boxed{204}
