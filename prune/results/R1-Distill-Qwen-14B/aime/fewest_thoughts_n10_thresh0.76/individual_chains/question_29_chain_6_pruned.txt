Okay, let me try to solve this problem. So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The lengths given are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the problem. I imagine rectangle ABCD with AB=107 and BC=16. So, AB is the length, and BC is the width. Since ABCD is a rectangle, all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. So, AD=BC=16, and AB=CD=107.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG=17 and EF=184. So, EF is the length (184 units) and FG is the width (17 units). Thus, EF=GH=184 and FG=EH=17.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D and C are from rectangle ABCD, and E and F are from rectangle EFGH. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F in that order? Or is it another order? Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order is D, E, C, F on a line. So, DE is a segment, then EC, then CF.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Hmm, cyclic quadrilateral has some properties. One important property is that the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. But I'm not sure if that will help directly here.

Alternatively, for a cyclic quadrilateral, the power of a point might be useful. Or perhaps using similar triangles or other geometric properties.

Let me try to sketch the scenario mentally. We have rectangle ABCD, with AB=107 and BC=16. So, it's a long rectangle.

Then, rectangle EFG
