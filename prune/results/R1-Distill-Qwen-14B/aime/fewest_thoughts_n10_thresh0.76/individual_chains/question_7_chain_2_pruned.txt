Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that the octagon can be rotated in such a way that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They say the answer will be in the form m/n, where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. We have a regular octagon, so it's an eight-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each color having a 50% chance. So, each vertex is an independent event with two possible outcomes.

Now, the key part is that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, imagine spinning the octagon so that any blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. The question is about the probability of this being possible.

Hmm, so I think this relates to some kind of symmetry or permutation. Since the octagon is regular, it has rotational symmetry. The rotational symmetries of a regular octagon are rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., up to 315째, right? So, there are 8 rotational symmetries in total, corresponding to the 8 vertices.

I think the problem is asking for the probability that the coloring of the octagon's vertices is such that there exists a rotation that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. So, if we denote the original set of red vertices as R and blue as B, after some rotation, the image of B should be exactly R.

Wait, but since each vertex is colored independently, R and B are determined by the coloring. So, in other words, we need the coloring to be such that there exists a rotation that swaps R and B.

But wait, for a given coloring, how can we find such a rotation? Maybe the coloring has some periodicity that allows such a swap. Alternatively, perhaps the coloring is symmetric in a way that such a rotation is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the coloring must be fixed under some rotation, but not necessarily all rotations. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another way to think about it: if the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices move to red positions, that implies that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, mathematically, if R is the set of red vertices, then B must be equal to R rotated by some angle.

But since the colorings are such that R and B are complementary (since every vertex is either red or blue), then if B is a rotation of R, that implies that R is a rotation of B as well, so they're symmetric in that way.

So, the problem reduces to finding all colorings where the set of red vertices is a rotation of the set of blue vertices. Since B is just the complement of R, this is equivalent to R being a rotation of its own complement.

Alternatively,
