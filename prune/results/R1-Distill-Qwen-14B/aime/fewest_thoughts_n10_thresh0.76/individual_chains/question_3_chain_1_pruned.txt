Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen four. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about finding the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so first, let me make sure I understand the setup. Jen picks 4 numbers, and then another set of 4 numbers is randomly selected. So, the sample space is the set of all possible 4-number combinations from 10 numbers, which is C(10,4).

She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are in the randomly chosen 4. So, the prize-winning scenarios include cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen. The grand prize is specifically when all four are chosen.

We are to find the conditional probability: P(grand prize | prize). That is, given that she has won a prize (i.e., at least two numbers match), what is the probability that all four numbers matched?

To find this, I remember that conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), which is the probability of winning the grand prize. Therefore, P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability of the grand prize and the probability of winning any prize (at least two numbers matching). Then, divide them.

First, let's compute P(grand prize). Winning the grand prize means that all four of her numbers are selected in the lottery. Since the lottery randomly selects 4 numbers out of 10, the number of possible winning combinations for the grand prize is just 1 (the exact set she picked). The total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). So, P(grand prize) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(grand prize) = 1/210.

Next, I need to compute P(prize), which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. This is the probability of having exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers matching. So, we can compute each of these probabilities and sum them up.

Let me denote Jen's chosen numbers as a set A, and the lottery's chosen numbers as a set B. Then, |A ∩ B| can be 2, 3, or 4 for the prize cases.

The number of ways to choose exactly k numbers from A (which has 4 elements) and the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the rest of the set S (which has 10 - 4 = 6 elements). So, for each k, the number of favorable combinations is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).

Therefore, the total number of prize-winning combinations is the sum over k=2 to k=4 of C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).

Let me compute each term:

For k=2:
C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

For k=3:
C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

For k=4:
C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So, total prize-winning combinations: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, P(prize) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me double-check that. Because 90 + 24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(prize) is 115/210. Let's simplify that. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 115 ÷ 5 = 23, 210 ÷ 5 = 42. So, 23/42.

But wait, 23 is a prime number, so 23/42 is in simplest terms.

Alternatively, I can also compute P(prize) as 1 minus P(0 or 1 numbers matching). Maybe that's another way to verify.

Compute the probability that Jen wins no prize: this is when fewer than two numbers match, i.e., 0 or 1 numbers match.

Number of ways to choose 0 numbers from A and 4 from the remaining 6: C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1*15=15.

Number of ways to choose exactly 1 number from A and 3 from the remaining 6: C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80.

Total non-prize combinations: 15 + 80 = 95.

Thus, P(no prize) = 95/210.

Therefore, P(prize) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210 = 23/42, which matches my earlier calculation. So that's correct.

So, now, the conditional probability P(grand prize | prize) is P(grand prize)/P(prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, because 1/210 divided by 115/210 is (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

But 1 and 115 share a common factor of 1, so the fraction is already reduced: m=1, n=115. So m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait a minute, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the denominator, when I calculate P(prize), it's 115/210, which reduces to 23/42. But when I take P(grand prize) as 1/210 and divide by 115/210, it's indeed 1/115. So, that seems correct.

But let me check again. The number of grand prize combinations is 1, as only one exact 4-number combination. The number of prize combinations is 115, as computed.

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1 / 115, so m=1, n=115, m + n = 116.

Wait, but let me think again: when we compute P(grand prize | prize), it's the number of grand prize combinations divided by the number of prize combinations. Because both are subsets of the same sample space.

Wait, the sample space for the conditional probability is the set of all prize-winning combinations. So, the probability is the number of grand prize combinations (which is 1) divided by the number of prize combinations (115). So, 1/115.

Alternatively, in probability terms, since each combination is equally likely, the conditional probability is just the ratio of favorable cases over total cases in the conditional sample space.

So, yes, 1/115, which reduces to 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115, sum is 116.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the number of prize combinations. Because sometimes it's easy to miscount.

Prize combinations are when at least two numbers match. So
