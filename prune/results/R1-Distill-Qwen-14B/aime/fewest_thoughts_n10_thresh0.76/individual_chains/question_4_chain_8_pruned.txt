Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with two possible moves each turn: take 1 or 4 tokens. The player who takes the last token wins. So, it's similar to games like Nim, but with restricted moves.

I think the key here is to find the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote a position as "winning" (W) if the current player can force a win, and "losing" (L) if they can't, regardless of what they do.

The base case is n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move and thus loses. Wait, no. Actually, n=0 would mean the previous player took the last token and won, so maybe I should think of n=0 as a losing position for the current player. So, when n=0, current player can't move, so that's L.

Then, starting from n=1:

n=1: Current player can take 1 token and win. So W.
n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position for them. Wait, no—if I take 1, opponent is left with n=1, which is a W position for them, meaning they can win. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So, the only move is to take 1, leading to n=1 (W for them). So, n=2 must be a losing position for me. So L.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If n=2, current player takes 1, leaving n=1. The next player can take 1 and win. So, that's bad for me. Alternatively, can
