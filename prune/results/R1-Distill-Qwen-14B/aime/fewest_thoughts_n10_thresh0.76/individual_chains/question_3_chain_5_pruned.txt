Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. That sounds like a conditional probability problem.

Right, conditional probability. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, since winning the grand prize automatically means she won a prize, A ∩ B is just A. Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B). Let's figure out each.

First, P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Since she has to pick exactly the four numbers that are chosen. The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). And there's only one way she can win the grand prize, which is if her 4 numbers match exactly. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Next, P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen four. So, this includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers match. So, we can calculate the probability for each case and add them up.

But wait, another approach is to compute the probability of the complementary event (i.e., not winning a prize) and subtract it from 1. The complementary event is that fewer than two numbers match, meaning zero or one number matches. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

Let me try that approach because it might be easier. So, first, compute P(zero matches) and P(one match), then subtract their sum from 1.

To compute P(k matches), where k is 0 or 1, we can use the concept of combinations. The number of ways to choose k numbers from Jen's 4, and the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the other 6 numbers (since S has 10 numbers, and Jen has 4, so 10 - 4 =6). So, the number of favorable combinations is C(4,k) * C(6, 4 - k). Then, divide by the total number of possible combinations, which is C(10,4).

So, let's compute P(zero matches):

Number of ways to choose 0 from Jen's 4 and 4 from the other 6: C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1 * 15 =15.

Similarly, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Next, P(one match):

Number of ways to choose 1 from Jen's 4 and 3 from the other 6: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 =80.

So, P(one match) = 80 / 210 = 8/21.

Therefore, the probability of not winning a prize is P(zero) + P(one) = 1/14 + 8/21. Let me compute that. 

Convert to a common denominator: 1/14 is 3/42, and 8/21 is 16/42. So together, 3/42 + 16/42 =19/42.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = 23/42.

Wait, let me check that again. 1 is 42/42, minus 19/42 is 23/42. Yes.

So, P(B) is 23/42. And P(A) is 1/210.

So, putting it into the conditional probability formula: P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that. Dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So, 1/210 * 42/23.

Simplify: 42 and 210 have a common factor. 42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times (since 42*5=210). So, 42/210 = 1/5. Therefore, 1/210 * 42/23 = (1 * 42) / (210 * 23) = 42/(210*23) = (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, P(A|B) is 1/115. Therefore, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? 1 and 115 share no common factors besides 1, so yes.

So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating P(B).

Alternative approach: Instead of using complementary probability, compute P(B) directly as the probability of having exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.

Let me try that.

Number of ways to have exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). Because choose 2 from Jen's 4, and 2 from the other 6.

C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15, so 6*15=90.

Similarly, exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24.

Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

So, total favorable for B is 90 +24 +1 =115.

Therefore, P(B) is 115/210.

Simplify: both numerator and denominator can be divided by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. Which matches my previous result. So P(B)=23/42.

So, back to the conditional probability: 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210)*(42/23)= (42)/(210*23). 42 is 1/5 of 210, so 42/210=1/5. So, 1/5 *1/23=1/115.

So, yes, the probability
