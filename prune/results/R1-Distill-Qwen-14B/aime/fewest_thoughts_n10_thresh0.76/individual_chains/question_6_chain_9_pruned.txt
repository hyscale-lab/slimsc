Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and it's a bit of a brain teaser. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The problem involves two functions, f(x) and g(x), which are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, we're looking at two equations: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). We need to find the number of intersections of their graphs.

Hmm, okay. So, intersections occur where both equations are satisfied, meaning that (x, y) must satisfy both y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This seems a bit circular because y is expressed in terms of x, and x is expressed in terms of y. So, maybe substituting one into the other could help? Let's think about that.

But before jumping into substitution, perhaps it's better to understand what these functions f and g look like. Let's break them down.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So, the absolute value function |x| is straightforward—it's a V-shape graph with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 from |x| shifts the graph down by 1/2 unit, so the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). But then, taking the absolute value of that, ||x| - 1/2|, which reflects any negative parts back up. So, this creates a W-shaped graph, but let's think more carefully.

For f(x) = ||x| - a|, where a is a positive constant, the graph will have two 'V's. The original |x| is V-shaped. Subtracting a shifts it down, so the vertex is at (0, -a). Taking the absolute value of that makes the parts below the x-axis (where |x| - a is negative) reflect upward. So, the graph will have two minima at x = a and x = -a, each at y=0, and a maximum at x=0 of y= a. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me visualize it.

When x is between -a and a, |x| is less than a, so |x| - a is negative, so ||x| - a| = a - |x|. So, in that interval, the graph is a V upside down, going from (a, 0) to (0, a) to (-a, 0). And outside of that, for |x| >= a, |x| - a is non-negative, so ||x| - a| = |x| - a, which is a V shape again, going upwards as |x| increases beyond a.

So, for f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, it's a W-shaped graph with minima at x = ±1/2, y=0, and maxima at x=0, y=1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Following the same logic, it's a W-shaped graph with minima at x=±1/4, y=0, and maxima at x=0, y=1/4.

So both f and g are piecewise functions with these W-shapes. Now, moving on to the composite functions in the problem.

First, let's consider y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). So, to understand this, I need to compute f(sin(2πx)) first, then apply g to that result, and then multiply by 4.

Similarly, the other equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), so same process: compute f(cos(3πy)), apply g, multiply by 4, and set equal to x.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find the ranges of these composite functions and then find the number of solutions where x and y satisfy both equations.

Let me think about the ranges of the inner functions first.

Starting with sin(2πx): the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1. So, sin(2πx) ∈ [-1, 1].

Then, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's figure out the range of this.

Since |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1, we have |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]. Taking the absolute value, ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| ∈ [0, 1/2].

So, f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2]. Then, applying g to this, since g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

So, g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

Since f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2], let me analyze this.

Let me denote z = f(sin(2πx)). Then, z ∈ [0, 1/2].

So, g(z) = ||z| - 1/4|. Since z is non-negative, this simplifies to |z - 1/4|.

So, z ranges from 0 to 1/2. Let's compute g(z):

When z < 1/4, |z - 1/4| = 1/4 - z.

When z >= 1/4, |z - 1/4| = z - 1/4.

So, g(z) is a V-shaped graph with the minimum at z=1/4, g(z)=0, and increasing on either side. So, the range of g(z) is [0, 1/4].

Wait, let's check the maximum. When z=0, g(z)=1/4. When z=1/2, g(z)=1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. So, maximum value is 1/4, and minimum is 0. So, g(z) ∈ [0, 1/4].

Therefore, 4g(z) ∈ [0, 1]. So, 4g(f(sin(2πx))) ∈ [0,1]. Thus, y is in [0,1].

Similarly, let's analyze the other equation: x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

So, starting with cos(3πy). The cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, so cos(3πy) ∈ [-1, 1]. Then, |cos(3πy)| ∈ [0,1].

So, f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|.

Same as before, |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, so |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value, f(cos(3πy)) ∈ [0, 1/2].

Then, g is applied to that, so g(f(cos(3πy))) = ||f(cos(3πy)) - 1/4|.

Again, since f(cos(3πy)) ∈ [0,1/2], similar to before.

Let me denote w = f(cos(3πy)), so w ∈ [0, 1/2].

Then, g(w) = |w - 1/4|.

So, as w ranges from 0 to 1/2, g(w) ranges from 1/4 to 0 and back to 1/4. So, the maximum of g(w) is 1/4, and the minimum is 0. So, g(w) ∈ [0, 1/4].

Therefore, 4g(w) ∈ [0,1]. Thus, x is in [0,1].

So, both x and y are in [0,1]. So, we're looking for points (x,y) where x and y are between 0 and 1, and they satisfy the two equations.

Hmm, okay. So, to find the number of intersections, we can think of it as solving the system:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

With x, y ∈ [0,1].

This seems quite complex, but perhaps we can think about the periodicity and symmetry of the functions involved.

First, sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) have different periods. Let's see:

The function sin(2πx) has a period of 1, since sin(2π(x+1)) = sin(2πx + 2π) = sin(2πx). Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3, since cos(3π(y + 2/3)) = cos(3πy + 2π) = cos(3πy).

So, sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1, and cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3.

Given that x and y are in [0,1], we can think of the functions as being defined over this interval, but with different internal periodicities.

Now, the composite functions f and g introduce more complexity, but perhaps we can find the number of times the equations can be satisfied by considering how many solutions exist in the interval.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the number of solutions by analyzing the functions' behavior.

Wait, the equations are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, each variable is a function of the other. So, the system is:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

This is a system of equations where each variable is defined in terms of the other. So, to solve for (x, y), we can substitute one into the other.

But substitution might get messy because we have x in terms of y and y in terms of x. Another approach is to consider the functions as transformations and see how they interact.

Alternatively, since
