Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. The rectangles must have their sides lying on either the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there can be a lot of symmetry which might help in counting such shapes.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and each internal angle is the same. The central angle between any two adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, each vertex is 30 degrees apart from the next one around the center.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. A rectangle requires four points, such that the sides are straight lines (either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon) and the angles are all 90 degrees. Since the dodecagon is regular, all sides and diagonals are symmetrically placed.

I think the key here is to figure out how many sets of four points form a rectangle. But wait, in a regular polygon, not every set of four points forms a rectangle. So, I need to find how many such sets exist where the sides form right angles.

I remember that in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by choosing pairs of vertices that are diametrically opposite each other. Or maybe not exactly diametrically opposite, but separated by a certain number of sides. Let me think.

Wait, in a regular polygon, if two lines are perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to -1, but since we are dealing with a regular dodecagon, maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors or angles.

Each side of the dodecagon can be seen as a vector from the center to a vertex, with angles at 30-degree increments. So, the vector for a vertex can be represented as (cosθ, sinθ), where θ is 30°, 60°, 90°, etc., up to 330°.

For two vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So, if I have two vectors v and w, then v · w = 0.

But how does this help me count rectangles? Well, a rectangle is defined by two pairs of parallel sides that are perpendicular to each other. So, in the context of the dodecagon, each side or diagonal can be thought of as a vector, and rectangles are formed by selecting two vectors that are perpendicular and then finding their combinations.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that in a regular dodecagon, there are multiple axes of symmetry. Each rectangle will have its sides aligned along two such axes that are perpendicular to each other.

So, maybe I should first figure out how many pairs of perpendicular diameters exist in the dodecagon. Each diameter connects two opposite vertices. In a regular dodecagon, there are 6 such diameters, right? Because 12 vertices divided by 2 gives 6 diameters.

But wait, each diameter is separated by 30 degrees. So, each diameter is a line connecting vertex i to vertex i+6. For example, vertex 1 to 7,
