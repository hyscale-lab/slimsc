Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, so for n=12, it's (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about finding rectangles inside this dodecagon. So, I need to think about how rectangles can be formed using the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, in the dodecagon, I need to find four points such that the lines connecting them form a rectangle, with each side lying on a side or a diagonal.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to model the dodecagon on a coordinate system. If I place the dodecagon with its center at the origin and one vertex at (1,0), then each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is 30 degrees times the vertex number. For example, the first vertex is at 0 degrees, the next at 30 degrees, then 60, and so on up to 330 degrees.

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, I could think of the dodecagon as having vertices labeled from 0 to 11 in order around the polygon.

Now, when we talk about rectangles, the sides must be parallel to each other and meet at right angles. So, the sides of the rectangle must be either aligned with certain diagonals of the dodecagon or the sides themselves.

Wait a second, in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, the possible diagonals can connect vertices that are 2, 3, 4, ..., up to 5 steps apart because beyond that, they start overlapping with previous diagonals in the other direction.

Wait, why up to 5? Because
