Okay, let's try to solve this system of logarithmic equations. So, we have three equations:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²), which will be a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b, so maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Let me write each equation in terms of logs.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:

log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:

log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, okay, so now we have three equations with three variables: log₂(x), log₂(y), log₂(z). Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let me let:

a = log₂(x),
b = log₂(y),
c = log₂(z).

So now the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

So now we have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let me try to add and subtract these equations to eliminate variables.

Maybe adding equation 1 and equation 2. Let's see:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Adding them:
( a - a ) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Simplifies to:
0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6
So, -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/(6*2) = -5/12.

Wait, c is negative? But z is a positive real number, so log₂(z) could be negative if z is between 0 and 1. Okay, that's fine.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's try adding another pair. Maybe equation 1 and equation 3.

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Adding them:
(a - a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 + 1/4
Which becomes:
0 - 2b + 0 = 3/4
So, -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/(4*2) = -3/8.

Hmm, b is also negative. So log₂(y) is negative, meaning y is less than 1.

Now, we have b = -3/8 and c = -5/12.

Now, let's find a. Let's use equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Substituting b and c:

a - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2

Simplify:

a + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2

Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. 8 and 12 have a common denominator of 24.

So, 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24.

Adding them: 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24.

So, a + 19/24 = 1/2.

1/2 is 12/24, so:

a = 12/24 - 19/24 = (12 - 19)/24 = (-7)/24.

So, a = -7/24.

Wait, so all three logs are negative? That means x, y, z are all less than 1. Interesting.

So, a = log₂(x) = -7/24 → x = 2^(-7/24)
b = log₂(y) = -3/8 → y = 2^(-3/8)
c = log₂(z) = -5/12 → z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, we need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute the expression inside the log first:

x⁴ y³ z².

Taking log₂ of that:

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂(x) + 3 log₂(y) + 2 log₂(z).

Which is 4a + 3b + 2c.

Substituting a, b, c:

4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6 ≈ -1.1667

3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8 = -1.125

2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = -5/6 ≈ -0.8333

Adding them together:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Let me find a common denominator for 6 and 8. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = (-28)/24

-9/8 = (-27)/24

-5/6 = (-20)/24

Adding them:

(-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

Simplify this fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3.

-75 ÷3 = -25, 24 ÷3=8.

So, -25/8.

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8. m=25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, so no common factors.

Thus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with a, b, c:

a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.

Compute 4a: 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6.

3b: 3*(-3/8) = -9/8.

2c: 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.

Sum: (-7/6) + (-9/8)
