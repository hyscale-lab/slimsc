Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, and the other equation is quadratic in nature. I remember that in problems like these, sometimes symmetry or factoring can help. Let me see if I can manipulate the second equation to make it more manageable.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are among a, b, c. Maybe I can factor this somehow. Let me try factoring.

Wait, if I factor out a from the first two terms, I get a(a b + a c) + b(b a + b c) + c(c a + c b). But that doesn't seem immediately helpful. Alternatively, I can think of the expression as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That might be useful because from the first equation, I know that a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting those into the second equation, it becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, so that's 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

a² + b² + c² - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Wait, that might not be the most useful step. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the given condition a + b + c = 300.

I remember that a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, then a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Similarly, I also know that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, and abc. The formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Plugging in a + b + c = 300, this becomes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca)
