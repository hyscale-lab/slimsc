Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m√n/p, and then find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, how do I find the volume and surface area when I only have the edge lengths? Maybe I can use Heron's formula for the faces, but since it's a tetrahedron, not a flat triangle, it's a bit more complicated.

I also recall that if a tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, like in this problem (AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD), it's called an isosceles tetrahedron. There might be some special properties I can use here. For example, in such a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found more easily because of symmetry.

Let me think. In an isosceles tetrahedron, all four faces are congruent triangles, right? No, wait, that might not be correct. Because even though the opposite edges are equal, the faces could still be different unless the edges are arranged in a certain way.

Wait, no, actually, in an isosceles tetrahedron, the four faces are congruent triangles. Because each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. Let me check that.

Hold on, let's take a face, say triangle ABC. The edges are AB=√41, AC=√80, and BC=√89. Similarly, triangle ABD: AB=√41, AD=√89, BD=√80. Wait, so each face has sides √41, √80, √89. So all four faces are congruent triangles. That's helpful!

So each face has the same area. That means I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four to get the total surface area S.

So first, compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

To find the area, I can use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

But calculating Heron's formula with these square roots might be messy. Maybe another approach would be better. Alternatively, I can see if the triangle is right-angled. Let me check if a² + b² = c².

Compute a² + b²: 41 + 80 = 121. c² is 89. 121 ≠ 89, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for area in terms of coordinates. Wait, but without knowing the coordinates, that might not help.

Wait, another thought: if all the faces are congruent and the tetrahedron is isosceles, maybe I can compute its volume using a formula specific to such tetrahedrons.

I recall that for an isosceles tetrahedron, the volume can be computed using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c² - 2d²) )) / 12

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up formulas. Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

Yes, Cayley-Menger determinant sounds promising. The formula is:

288 V² = | determinant of the matrix:

0 1 1 1 1

1 0 a² b² c²

1 a² 0 d² e²

1 b² d² 0 f²

1 c² e² f² 0

|

Wait, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can find the determinant.

Wait, let me make sure I get the notation right. In the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB=a, AC=b, AD=c, BC=d, BD=e, CD=f, the determinant is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |

| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |

| 1  a²  0   d²  e² |

| 1  b² d²  0   f² |

| 1  c² e² f²  0   |

So the determinant is 5x5. Let me write down the given edge lengths:

AB = √41, so a² = 41

AC = √80, so b² = 80

AD = √89, so c² = 89

BC = √89, so d² =89

BD = √80, so e²=80

CD = √41, so f²=41

So the matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Hmm, looks symmetric. Maybe I can compute the determinant.

But computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is going to be tedious. Maybe I can find some patterns or simplify it.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall that for an isosceles tetrahedron, there's a simpler formula. Let me think.

Wait, in an isosceles tetrahedron, the volume can also be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) )) / 12

Wait, but that's for a triangle. Hmm, no, perhaps that's Heron's formula squared.

Wait, no, Heron's formula is area = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)), but volume is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the volume of an isosceles tetrahedron can be calculated as (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c² - 2d²) )) / 12, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the Cayley-Menger determinant.
