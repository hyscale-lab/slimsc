Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a fixed surface area and volume. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q, and find p+q. Hmm, alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem mentions that all boxes in set B have a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. So, for any box in B, if its dimensions are length x, width y, and height z, then the surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23.

The goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The radius of this sphere would be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box. The space diagonal of a box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the radius r is half of that, which is (1/2)sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, to find r², I need to find x² + y² + z² and then divide by 4.

Now, how can I express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given surface area and volume? Let's recall that for a rectangular box, the square of the space diagonal is x² + y² + z². Also, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27. So, I have that.

But I also know that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). From this, I can express x² + y² + z² as (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + zx). We already know that xy + yz + zx is 27, so x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 54.

But I don't know x + y + z yet. Maybe I can find that somehow using the volume. The volume is xyz = 23. Hmm, but that's tricky because it's symmetric in x, y, z, but not sure how to relate it to x + y + z directly.

Wait, perhaps I can use some inequalities here. Since we're dealing with a box, and we need the maximum space diagonal, but wait no, actually, we're looking for the minimal sphere that can contain all such boxes. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain any box from B, so r would be the maximum possible value of (1/2)sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all x, y, z satisfying the given surface area and volume.

Therefore, we need to maximize x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² under the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx = 27, and Q = xyz = 23.

We have x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = S² - 54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize S², which is (x + y + z) squared. So, the problem becomes: maximize S², given that P = 27 and Q = 23.

Hmm, how can I relate S and Q? There's an inequality that relates these terms. Let me think about symmetric functions and the relationships between them.

In the context of symmetric polynomials, for three variables x, y, z, we have the following relationships:

- S = x + y + z
- P = xy + yz + zx = 27
- Q = xyz = 23

We also know that for real numbers, certain inequalities must hold. For example, using the AM ≥ GM inequality, but I'm not sure how that applies here directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers for constrained optimization. Since we need to maximize S² under the constraints P = 27 and Q = 23.

Wait, but S is part of the variables, and P and Q are functions of x, y, z. So, this might get complicated, but let me try to set up the Lagrangian.

Let me denote f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which we need to maximize.
