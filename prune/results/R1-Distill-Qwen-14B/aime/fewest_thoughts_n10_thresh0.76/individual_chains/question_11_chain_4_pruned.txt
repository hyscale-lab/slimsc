Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down.

First off, I know that z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. That means I can represent z in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I could also write z as a + bi, but maybe polar form will be more helpful here because of the magnitude. Let me think: since the magnitude is 4, the reciprocal of z (which is 1/z) will have a magnitude of 1/4. So 1/z = (a - bi)/(a² + b²), but since |z| = 4, |1/z| = 1/4.

So the expression we're dealing with is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me write that down:

Expression = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since we're looking for the largest possible real part, I think I need to express this in terms of real and imaginary parts and then find the maximum of the real part. Alternatively, maybe I can use some properties of complex numbers to simplify this.

Let me try writing z as 4e^{iθ}. Then 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, right? Because 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|², which for |z|=4 is \overline{z}/16. Since z = 4e^{iθ}, then \overline{z} = 4e^{-iθ}, so 1/z = (4e^{-iθ})/16 = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So substituting z and 1/z into the expression, we get:

Expression = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)( (1/4)e^{-iθ} )

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = [75*4 + 117*4i]e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = [96*(1/4) + 144*(1/4)i]e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So the expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can write this using Euler's formula. Let me recall Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let me expand both terms.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Let me collect real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Collect real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary part: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

Now, let's add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together from both terms.

Total Real Part:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Total Imaginary Part:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So the expression simplifies to:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)

But since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part as θ varies. So, we need to maximize the function f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, this is a standard optimization problem for a function of the form A cosθ + B sinθ. I remember that the maximum value of such a function is sqrt(A² + B²). Let me recall: for f(θ) = A cosθ + B sinθ, the maximum is sqrt(A² + B²).

Wait, in this case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, so that's
