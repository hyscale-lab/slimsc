Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon, ABCDEF. All the opposite sides are parallel. That's interesting. It's equilateral, so all the sides are of equal length, but it's not necessarily regular since the angles might not be equal. The problem says that if we extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Since all sides are equal, each side is length 's', which is what we're looking for.

Extending AB, CD, EF to form a triangle. So, when we extend these three sides, they meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, 300. I think I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon's sides.

I remember that in such hexagons, the sides can be thought of as vectors, and their sum must be zero because it's a closed polygon. Since opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, but wait, the hexagon is equilateral, not necessarily regular. Wait, no, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel and equal, but this is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel. Wait, so maybe the sides are vectors with equal magnitude but different directions.

Let me consider each side as a vector in the plane. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each side has the same length 's', but each consecutive side is turned by some angle. Since opposite sides are parallel, their direction vectors are the same or negatives. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a translation. If opposite sides are parallel and the hexagon is convex, the hexagon can be thought of as a combination of three pairs of parallel sides. Wait, that might not directly help.

I recall that when you extend the sides of a hexagon, the triangle formed by these extensions is called the outer triangle. Maybe I can use similar triangles or some proportionality.

Wait, let me think about the triangle formed by AB, CD, EF. Each of these sides is extended, so maybe the triangle's sides are related to the sides of the hexagon through some scaling factor.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides are 's'. The triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me denote these as a=200, b=240, c=300.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles or affine transformations. Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the side length of such a hexagon based on the outer triangle.

Wait, I think I've heard of a formula where if you have a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the side length can be found using the formula 2 * (area of the outer triangle) / (perimeter of the hexagon). Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relation involving the sides of the outer triangle and the hexagon's side length.
