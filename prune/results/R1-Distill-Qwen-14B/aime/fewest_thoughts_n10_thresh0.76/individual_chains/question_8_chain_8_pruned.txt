Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down.

First, the first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. So, we're dealing with nonnegative integers that add up to 300. The second equation seems more involved. It has terms like a²b and a²c, which makes me think of symmetric expressions. Maybe I can factor or rearrange this in a way that relates to the first equation.

Let me write down the second equation again: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Wait, that looks like it can be factored in terms of a, b, and c. Let me see. If I factor out, say, a² from the first two terms, I get a²(b + c). Similarly, factoring b² from the next two gives b²(a + c), and c² from the last two gives c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that seems helpful. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). So substituting those into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So now, the equation simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, perhaps I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums like ab + bc + ca.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, then 300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So 90,000 = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + bc + ca). Let me denote S = a² + b² + c² and P = ab + bc + ca. Then, S + 2P = 90,000.

Similarly, for the cubes, I think the formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Let me check that formula. Yes, it's correct: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, using that, we can write a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3abc. Let me compute 300³: 300 * 300 is 90,000, multiplied by 300 again is 27,000,000. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.

Now, going back to the equation I had earlier:

300S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expressions for S and a³ + b³ + c³:

300S - [27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Expanding that:

300S - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange the terms:

300S + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000.

Which gives:

300S + 900P - 3abc = 33,000,000.

I can factor out a 3 from each term on the left:

3*(100S + 300P - abc) = 33,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100S + 300P - abc = 11,000,000.

Hmm, now I need to express this in terms of S and P. Earlier, I had S + 2P = 90,000. So S = 90,000 - 2P. Let me substitute that into the equation.

So, 100*(90,000 - 2P) + 300P - abc = 11,000,000.

Calculating 100*(90,000 - 2P):

100*90,000 = 9,000,000
100*(-2P) = -200P

So, substituting:

9,000,000 - 200P + 300P - abc = 11,000,000.

Combine like terms:

9,000,000 + 100P - abc = 11,000,000.

Subtract 9,000,000 from both sides:

100P - abc = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - abc = 2,000,000. Let me write that as:

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, interesting. So now, I have expressions for S, a³ + b³ + c³, and a relation between P and abc. Let me see if I can find another relation or perhaps express everything in terms of P.

Wait, the original problem asks for nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c). So maybe I can consider that a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, so perhaps some of them are zero? Or maybe not. Let's see.

But first, let me think about what P is. P is ab + bc + ca. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P is also a nonnegative integer.

Given that, from the equation:

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, abc must be equal to 100 times P minus 2,00
