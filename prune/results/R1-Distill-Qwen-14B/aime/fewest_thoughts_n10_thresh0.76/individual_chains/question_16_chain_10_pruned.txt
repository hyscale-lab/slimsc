Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m for which m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². 

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking for. So, I'm looking for the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I find that p, I need to find the minimal m with that property.

I remember that primes p for which x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has solutions are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, and we need an element of order 8 to have x⁴ ≡ -1. So, 8 divides p-1, meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, the possible primes we're looking at are 17, 97, etc. But maybe there are smaller primes? Wait, primes like 5: does 5 satisfy this? Let me check.

Wait, p=5: Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. So, let me compute n⁴ mod 25 for n from 1 to 24. But that might take a while. Alternatively, I can check if -1 is a quartic residue modulo 5².

Wait, but for p=5, does x⁴ + 1 have roots modulo 5?

Let me compute x⁴ mod 5 for x from 0 to 4:

0⁴=0, 1⁴=1, 2⁴=16≡1, 3⁴=81≡1, 4⁴=256≡1 mod 5. So, x⁴ mod 5 is either 0 or 1. So, x⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5 is equivalent to 1 ≡ -1 mod 5, which is 1≡4 mod5, which is not true. So, no solution mod5, meaning p=5 doesn't work.

What about p=17? Let me check if x⁴ ≡ -1 mod17 has a solution. Since 17≡1 mod8, it should. Let's see:

The multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic of order 16. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod17. Hmm, let me compute the possible fourth powers.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find such an x. Let me try x=2: 2⁴=16≡-1 mod17. Oh, yeah, 2⁴=16, which is -1 mod17. So yes, x=2 is a solution mod17. So, does this solution lift to mod17²=289? That is, does there exist an n such that n⁴≡-1 mod289?

If so, then p=17 is a candidate. But is p=17 the smallest? Wait, before 17, the primes congruent to 1 mod8 are 17, 97, etc. Wait, no, 17 is the first prime after 2, 3, 5, 7 which is 1 mod8. So, 17 is the first candidate.

But wait, let me check p=2. Does n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod4 have a solution? Let's see: n⁴ mod4 can be 0 or 1. So, n⁴ +1 can be 1 or 2 mod4. So, it's never 0 mod4. So, p=2 is out.

Similarly, p=3: n⁴ mod3. The possible residues are 0,1, or 1 (since 2⁴=16≡1 mod3). So, n⁴ +1 mod3 would be 1 or 2. So, no solution mod9 either.

p=5: as before, no solution mod5, so mod25 definitely no.

p=7: Let's see if x⁴ ≡-1 mod7 has a solution. The multiplicative group mod7 has order 6. So, x⁴ would have possible orders dividing 6. Let's compute x⁴ mod7:

x=1: 1
x=2: 16≡2
x=3: 81≡4
x=4: 256≡4
x=5: 625≡2
x=6: 1296≡1
So, x⁴ mod7 is 1,2,4.
