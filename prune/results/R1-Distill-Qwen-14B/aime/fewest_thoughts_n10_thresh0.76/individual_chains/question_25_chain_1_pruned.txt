Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me read through it again and try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own other things: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. So, each resident owns at least the candy hearts, and some might own one, two, three, or all four of these items.

The problem also gives some more specific numbers: 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things.

Hmm, okay. So, we're dealing with sets and their intersections. This seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion is a counting technique that helps find the size of the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections.

Let me recall the formula for four sets. The total number of elements in the union of four sets A, B, C, D is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the sum of the sizes of all possible two-set intersections plus the sum of all possible three-set intersections minus the size of the four-set intersection. The formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But in this problem, we're told that every resident owns at least one item—specifically, the candy hearts. So the union of all these sets must be the entire 900 residents. Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900.

Wait, but let me think. Wait, no. The candy hearts are a separate item. No, wait, actually, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are like a given—so all 900 residents are included in the "candy hearts" set. Then, the other sets (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are subsets of these 900. So, the union of all four sets is 900.

But wait, no—because the problem doesn't say that all residents own at least one of the other three things. It says each owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are the base set, and the other three are optional.

So, in terms of the problem, the four "things" are: candy hearts (C), diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S). Since every resident owns at least C, the total number of people in the union of all four sets is 900.

So, applying the inclusion-exclusion principle:

|C ∪ D ∪ G ∪ S| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |C ∩ D| - |C ∩ G| - |C ∩ S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |C ∩ D ∩ G| + |C ∩ D ∩ S| + |C ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| - |C ∩ D ∩ G ∩ S|

But wait, |C| is 900 because everyone owns candy hearts. |D| is 195, |G| is 367, |S| is 562.

So plugging in, we
