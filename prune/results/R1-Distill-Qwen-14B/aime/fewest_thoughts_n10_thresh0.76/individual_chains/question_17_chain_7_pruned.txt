Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes, their surface areas and volumes, and finding the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. The problem states that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q, and then find p + q. 

Hmm, let's break it down. First, we're dealing with rectangular boxes, so they have length, width, and height, which I'll call x, y, z for simplicity. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume is xyz. 

Given that the surface area is 54, so 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. That simplifies to xy + yz + xz = 27. And the volume is 23, so xyz = 23. 

Now, the sphere that can contain the box must have a radius equal to half of the box's space diagonal. The space diagonal of a rectangular box is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). So, the radius r would be half of that, so sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/2. Therefore, r squared would be (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4. 

So, to find r^2, I need to find x^2 + y^2 + z^2 and then divide by 4. But how do I find x^2 + y^2 + z^2 given the surface area and volume? 

I remember that there's a relationship between (x + y + z)^2 and x^2 + y^2 + z^2. Specifically, (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + xz). Since I know that xy + yz + xz is 27, I can write this as (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 54. 

So, if I can find (x + y + z)^2, I can subtract 54 to get x^2 + y^2 + z^2. But how do I find x + y + z? 

Hmm, I know that for a given volume and surface area, the sum x + y + z is minimized when the box is a cube, but I don't know if that's the case here. But wait, in this problem, we're not necessarily looking for the minimum sum, but rather the maximum of the space diagonal, because the sphere needs to contain all such boxes, so the sphere must be large enough to contain the box with the maximum space diagonal. Therefore, to find the minimal sphere that can contain any such box, we need the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in set B. 

Ah, that makes more sense. So, among all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the one with the maximum space diagonal. Then, compute r^2 as (space diagonal squared)/4. 

So, to find the maximum x^2 + y^2 + z^2, given that xyz = 23 and xy + yz + xz = 27. 

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, I can try to express variables in terms of each other to reduce the number of variables. 

Let me think. Let's denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz = 27, and Q = xyz = 23. 

We know that x, y, z are the roots of the cubic equation t^3 - S t^2 + P t - Q = 0, which is t^3 - S t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0. 

But not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can use inequalities to relate x^2 + y^2 + z^2. 

Another approach: Since we have two equations: 

1. xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

We can consider symmetric functions or perhaps assume that one variable is expressed in terms of the others. Let's say z = 23/(xy). Then, plug into the first equation: 

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27

Simplify each term:

xy + (23/x) + (23/y) = 27

Hmm, that might be a bit messy, but maybe we can let u = x + y and v = xy. Then, since z = 23/(xy) = 23/v.

So, let's try that substitution. 

We have:

xy + yz + xz = 27

Which becomes:

v + y*(23/v) + x*(23/v) = 27

Factor out 23/v:

v + (23/v)(y + x) = 27

But x + y = u, so:

v + (23 u)/v = 27

Multiply both sides by v:

v^2 + 23 u = 27 v

So, 23 u = 27 v - v^2

Thus, u = (27 v - v^2)/23

Now, we also know that x and y are the roots of the quadratic equation t^2 - u t + v = 0. The discriminant must be non-negative for real roots, so u^2 - 4 v >= 0.

Substituting u from above:

[(27v - v^2)/23]^2 - 4v >= 0

This seems complicated, but maybe we can proceed.

Let me denote w = v for simplicity. Then,

[(27w - w^2)/23]^2 - 4w >= 0

Let me compute [(27w - w^2)/23]^2:

= [w(27 - w)]^2 / (23)^2
= w^2 (27 - w)^2 / 529

So the inequality becomes:

w^2 (27 - w)^2 / 529 - 4w >= 0

Multiply both sides by 529 to eliminate the denominator:

w^2 (27 - w)^2 - 4w * 529 >= 0

Let me expand this:

w^2 (729 - 54w + w^2) - 2116 w >= 0

Expanding further:

729 w^2 - 54 w^3 + w^4 - 2116 w >= 0

So,

w^4 -54 w^3 +729 w^2 -2116 w >=0

This is a quartic equation in w. Hmm, this seems really complicated. Maybe I should try another approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the AM â‰¥ GM inequality or other inequalities to find bounds on x, y, z. 

Wait, since
