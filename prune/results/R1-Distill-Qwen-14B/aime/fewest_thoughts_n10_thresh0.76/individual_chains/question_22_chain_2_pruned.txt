Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all sides equal in angles, just all sides equal in length. But wait, actually, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all angles are equal, but here it's only equilateral, so angles can vary as long as opposite sides are parallel. Interesting.

Since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon must be similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed along different axes. Wait, but in a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees. If this hexagon is equilateral but with opposite sides parallel, maybe the angles are still 120 degrees? Or maybe not. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me think about how this triangle is formed. If you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, these three lines will meet at three points to form a triangle. So, each side of this triangle is an extension of one of these sides.

Wait, since the hexagon is convex, each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. So, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet at some points forming a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

I remember that in such cases, the hexagon can be thought of as being "inscribed" within this triangle, with each side of the hexagon corresponding to a portion of the triangle's sides.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each of its sides has the same length, let's call it 's'. The triangle formed by the extensions has sides 200, 240, and 300. So, these must correspond to the extensions beyond the hexagon's sides.

I think this problem relates to similar triangles and proportions. Maybe the triangle is divided into smaller similar triangles by the hexagon.

Wait, let me try to model this. Let's denote the triangle as triangle XYZ, where XY = 200, YZ = 240, and XZ = 300. When we extend AB, CD, and EF, these sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, no. Because the sides AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is inside the triangle XYZ. So, the lines AB, CD, EF are parallel to the sides of XYZ. Hmm, but how?

Wait, maybe each side of the hexagon is between the sides of the triangle. So, the triangle is divided into smaller triangles and the hexagon is in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is divided by lines parallel to its sides, creating similar triangles and a smaller similar triangle in the center, which is the
