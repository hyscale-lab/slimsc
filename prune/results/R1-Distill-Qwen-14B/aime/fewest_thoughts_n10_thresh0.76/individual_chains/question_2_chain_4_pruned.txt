Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC squared, where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the points given are O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis, specifically at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Hmm, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so that's between 0 and 1 as well.

Next, there's a family of segments F, which are all line segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each of these segments has one endpoint P on the x-axis and the other endpoint Q on the y-axis. So, for any such segment PQ, P is somewhere on the positive x-axis, Q is somewhere on the positive y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any of these segments PQ except for AB itself. So, AB must be one of the segments in family F, right? Because C is on AB and only on AB, and not on any other PQ from F.

I need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Let me visualize this setup. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is a line segment connecting A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all unit-length segments with endpoints on the axes in the first quadrant.

Since AB is a segment from A to B, which are both in the first quadrant, AB must be one of these unit-length segments. Let me check the length of AB to confirm.

The distance between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a segment in family F.

Now, the family F includes all possible unit-length segments PQ with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for any t between 0 and 1, we can parametrize points P(t, 0) on the x-axis and Q(0, s) on the y-axis such that the distance PQ is 1. So, sqrt[(t - 0)^2 + (0 - s)^2] = 1, which implies t^2 + s^2 = 1. Therefore, for each t in [0,1], s = sqrt(1 - t^2). So, each segment PQ can be represented as from (t, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)).

So, the family F consists of all such line segments for t in [0,1]. Now, AB is the segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which fits this model because (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, distinct from A and B, such that it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, we need to find a point C on AB that isn't covered by any other PQ in F.

Wait, but AB is just one particular segment in F. So, the other segments are PQ for various t. So, for each t, the segment PQ is a line from (t,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)). We need to find a point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other such PQ except AB itself.

So, essentially, we're looking for a point on AB that is not the intersection point of AB with any other PQ from F. So, except for AB, all other PQs in F should not pass through C.

But wait, AB is one of the PQs, right? So, in this problem, the point C is on AB, and for all other PQs in F, C is not on them. So, we need to find such a C on AB.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the point on AB that's not overlapped by any other PQ in F. So, maybe when we look at the envelope of all these PQs, the point C is where AB just touches this envelope.

Hmm, that might not be the right way to think about it. Maybe we can parametrize AB and find a point on it that doesn't lie on any other segment PQ except AB.

Let me parametrize AB. Let's express AB as a line segment. The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0), and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equations for AB can be written as x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2) t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So, a general point C on AB can be expressed as ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t ), for t between 0 and 1.

Now, suppose C is on another PQ segment from F. Let's say another segment PQ, which goes from (t, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)) for some t ≠ 1/2 (since t=1/2 gives AB itself).

We need to find if point C lies on such a PQ. So, for a given C, we need to check if there's a t ≠ 1/2 such that C lies on PQ(t).

So, to find if point C lies on PQ(t), we can parametrize PQ(t). Let me parametrize PQ(t) with a parameter s (0 ≤ s ≤ 1):

x = t(1 - s)
y = sqrt(1 - t^2) * s

So, when s=0, we're at P(t,0), and s=1, we're at Q(0, sqrt(1 - t^2)).

So, if point C(x,y) lies on PQ(t), then there exists some s such that:

x = t(1 - s)
y = sqrt(1 - t^2) * s

We can solve for s from the second equation: s = y / sqrt(1 - t^2).

Substituting into the first equation:

x = t (1 - s) = t [1 - y / sqrt(1 - t^2)]

So, x = t - t y / sqrt(1 - t^
