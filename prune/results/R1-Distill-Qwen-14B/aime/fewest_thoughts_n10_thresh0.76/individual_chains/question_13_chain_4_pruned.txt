Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop visits. Let me try to understand what's going on and figure out how to solve it.

So, the problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the total time she takes, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop, is 4 hours. Then, when she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

The question is asking, if she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how many minutes will the walk take her, including the 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Alright, let me break this down.

First, I need to find the values of 's' and 't'. Because once I know those, I can compute the time she takes when walking at 's + 1/2' km/h.

So, let's start by writing down what we know.

When she walks at speed 's' km/h:
- Distance = 9 km
- Time taken for the walk = (9 / s) hours (since time = distance / speed)
- Total time including coffee shop: 4 hours. So, 4 hours = (9 / s) + t (but wait, t is in minutes, so I need to convert units)

Wait, that's an important point. The time taken for the walk is in hours, but the total time includes 't' minutes. So, I have to make sure all units are consistent.

Let me convert 4 hours into minutes. 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Similarly, when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to minutes as well. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes makes 144 minutes.

So, now, let's set up the equations.

When speed is 's' km/h:
Time walking = 9 / s hours. Let's convert that to minutes: (9 / s) * 60 minutes.
Plus coffee shop time: t minutes.
Total: 240 minutes.

So, equation 1: (9 / s) * 60 + t = 240.

When speed is 's + 2' km/h:
Time walking = 9 / (s + 2) hours. Convert to minutes: (9 / (s + 2)) * 60 minutes.
Plus coffee shop time: t minutes.
Total: 144 minutes.

So, equation 2: (9 / (s + 2)) * 60 + t = 144.

Now, I have two equations with two variables, 's' and 't'. I can solve them to find 's' and 't'.

Let me write the equations again for clarity.

Equation 1: (540 / s) + t = 240.

Equation 2: (540 / (s + 2)) + t = 144.

Wait, how did I get 540? Because 9 km divided by s km/h gives hours, multiplied by 60 to get minutes: 9 * 60 / s = 540 / s.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate 't'.

So, equation 1 minus equation 2:

(540/s + t) - (540/(s + 2) + t) = 240 - 144.

Simplify the left side:

540/s - 540/(s + 2) + t - t = 96.

So, 540 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 96.

Let me compute [1/s - 1/(s + 2)]:

That's equal to [(s + 2) - s] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)].

So, 540 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 96.

So, 540 * 2 = 1080.

Thus, 1080 / [s(s + 2)] = 96.

Now, let's write that as:

1080 = 96 * s(s + 2).

Compute 96 * s(s + 2).

So, 96s(s + 2) = 1080.

Let's compute 96s(s + 2) = 96s² + 192s.

So, equation: 96s² + 192s - 1080 = 0.

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by a common factor.

Looking at 96, 192, and 1080.

96 ÷ 24 = 4, 192 ÷24=8, 1080 ÷24=45.

Wait, 96 ÷ 24 is 4, 192 ÷24=8, 1080 ÷24=45. So, 4s² + 8s -45=0.

Alternatively, perhaps 96 and 1080 are both divisible by 12.

96 ÷12=8, 192 ÷12=16, 1080 ÷12=90.

So, 8s² + 16s -90=0.

Wait, but 8, 16, 90 have a common factor of 2.

Divide again by 2: 4s² +8s -45=0.

Yes, same as before.

So, the quadratic equation is 4s² +8s -45=0.

Let me solve this quadratic equation for 's'.

Using quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a=4, b=8, c=-45.

So, discriminant D = b² -4ac = 64 -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784.

Square root of 784 is 28.

So, s = [ -8 ±28 ] / (2*4) = ( -8 ±28 ) /8.

So, two solutions:

1) [ -8 +28 ] /8 = 20/8 = 2.5

2) [ -8 -28 ] /8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s=2.5 km/h.

So, her walking speed is 2.
