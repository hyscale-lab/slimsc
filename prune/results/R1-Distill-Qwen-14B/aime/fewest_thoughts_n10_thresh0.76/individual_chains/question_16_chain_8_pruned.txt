Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So the first part is to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared, meaning n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Then, once I have that p, I need to find the smallest m that satisfies m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p² might have some specific properties. Maybe I should start by checking small primes and see if they satisfy the condition.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. I'll check each to see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Starting with p=2: Let's compute n⁴ +1 mod 4. For n=1: 1+1=2 mod 4, which is not 0. n=2: 16 +1=17 mod 4 is 1. Wait, maybe I should think differently. n can be 1 or 3 mod 4. Let's see:

n=1: 1⁴ +1=2 mod 4, which isn't 0. n=3: 81 +1=82, mod 4 is 2. So p=2 doesn't work because n⁴ +1 is never 0 mod 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3: Let's check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Since -1 mod 9 is 8, so we need n⁴ ≡8 mod 9.

Let me compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8:

n=1: 1 mod 9
n=2: 16 mod 9 =7
n=3: 81 mod 9=0
n=4: 256 mod 9. Let's see: 256/9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4, so 4 mod 9.
n=5: 625 mod 9. 625 divided by 9: 9*69=621, so 625-621=4, so 4 mod9.
Wait, that's the same as n=4. Hmm, maybe I can find a pattern.

Wait, maybe I should compute each n:

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9
n=2: 2⁴=16=7 mod9
n=3: 0 mod9
n=4: 4⁴=256. 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9
n=5: 5⁴=625. 625-9*69=625-621=4. So 4 mod9
n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 is 144*9, so 0 mod9
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 divided by 9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7. So 7 mod9
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 - 9*455=4096-4095=1. So 1 mod9.

So the residues are: 1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1 for n=1 to n=8. So in mod9, the possible quartic residues are 0,1,4,7.

But we are looking for 8 mod9. So from the above, none of the n from 1 to 8 give 8 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work.

Next prime, p=5. So check if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25, since p² is 25.

-1 mod25 is 24. So we need n⁴ ≡24 mod25.

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24. But that's a lot, maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps using Euler's theorem. Since φ(25)=20, so if n and 25 are coprime, n^20 ≡1 mod25. But we're dealing with n^4. So let's see.

I can compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24, but that's tedious. Maybe think about the possible quartic residues.

Alternatively, maybe we can note that if n^4 ≡-1 mod25, then (n^2)^2 ≡-1 mod25. So that requires that -1 is a square mod25. But wait, does it?

Wait, if (n²)² ≡ -1 mod25, then -1 must be a square mod25. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, let me check if -1 is a quadratic residue mod25.

Quadratic residues mod25 are the squares:

n | n² mod25
0 | 0
1 |1
2 |4
3 |9
4 |16
5 |0
6 |36 mod25=11
7 |49 mod25=24
8 |64 mod25=14
9 |81 mod25=6
10 |0
11 |121 mod25=21
12 |144 mod25=19
13 |169 mod25=19
14 |196 mod25=21
15 |0
16 |256 mod25=6
17 |289 mod25=14
18 |324 mod25=24
19 |361 mod25=11
20 |0
21 |441 mod25=16
22 |484 mod25=9
23 |529 mod25=4
24 |576 mod25=1

So quadratic residues mod25 are 0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24.

Looking for -1 mod25 is 24, which is a quadratic residue. So 24 is a square mod25, so (n²)^2 ≡24 mod25 is possible, but only if 24 is a quartic residue.

Wait, but in this case, if n^4 ≡24 mod25, then n² must be a square root of 24 mod25.

From the quadratic residues, 24 is a residue, so its square roots are numbers whose squares are 24 mod25. From the table above, n=7 and n=18 have squares 24 mod25. So the square roots of 24 mod25 are 7 and 18.

So, n² ≡7 or 18 mod25.

Wait, but 7 and 18 are not quadratic residues mod25, because looking at the squares mod25 (as above), 7 isn't a square, nor is 18. Wait, is that right?

Wait, from the table, the squares mod25 are 0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24. So 7 and 18 are not in that list. So that would mean that 7 and 18 are not quadratic residues mod25. Therefore, n² ≡7 mod25 has no solution, same with n²≡18 mod25. Therefore, n⁴ ≡24 mod25 has no solution, because it would require n² being 7 or 18 mod25, which is impossible.

So p=5 also doesn't work.

Next prime: p=7.

So p²=49. We need to find n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod49. -1 mod49 is 48. So n⁴ ≡48 mod49.

Let me see if such an n exists.

Again, perhaps we can first check if -1 is a quartic residue modulo 49.

Alternatively, maybe using Euler's theorem: φ(49)=42, so n^42 ≡1 mod49 for n coprime to 49. So n^4 has an order dividing 42 / gcd(4,42)=42/2=21. So possible orders are divisors of 21: 1,3,7,21.

So if n^4 ≡48 mod49, then (n^4)^{21} ≡48^{21} ≡1 mod49. So 48^{21} mod49.

But 48 ≡-1 mod49, so (-1)^21 ≡-1 mod49, which would have to be ≡1 mod49. But -1≡48 mod49, which isn't 1. So that can't be, so perhaps there is no solution.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if n^4 ≡48 mod49, then n^4 squared would be 48² mod49. Wait, maybe I should compute 48 mod49 is -1. So 48² ≡1 mod49. So 48^21 is (48^2)^10 *48^1 ≡1^10 * (-1) ≡-1 mod49. So 48^21 ≡-1 mod49. But from n^4 ≡48, (n^4)^{21} ≡ (-1) ≡ n^{84}≡1 mod49, since φ(49)=42, so n^42≡1, so n^{84}=(n^42)^2≡1 mod49. So (-1) ≡1 mod49? That would imply -1≡1 mod49, which is impossible because 49 is bigger than 2. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, there is no such n. So p=7 doesn't work.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again.

If n^4 ≡ -1 mod
