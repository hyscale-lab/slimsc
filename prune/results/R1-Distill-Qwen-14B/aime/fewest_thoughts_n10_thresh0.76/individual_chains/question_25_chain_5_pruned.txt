Okay, so I have this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's one thing for sure. Then, there are other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade.

Wait, so each resident owns at least the candy hearts, right? So, the total number of ownerships isn't just 900, but each person can own multiple things. The problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.

Hmm, this seems like a problem involving sets and Venn diagrams. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principle from my math class. Let me recall. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps in calculating the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections.

But wait, in this case, each resident is an element, and each set represents ownership of an item: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. But actually, candy hearts are owned by everyone, so that's like a universal set here. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, does that mean that every resident is counted in the candy hearts set? So, the candy hearts set has 900 elements. 

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people owning candy hearts; it's given that each of the 900 owns it, so it's 900. So, in terms of sets, D is diamond rings (195), G is golf clubs (367), S is spades (562), and C is candy hearts (900). 

But since C is 900, which is the total number, it's like every resident is in C. So, when we talk about the union of D, G, S, and C, it's just the same as the union of D, G, and S because C is everyone.

Wait, but the problem is about finding how many own all
