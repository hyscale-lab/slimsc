Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this token game. There's a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 are there where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, right. So this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in these types of games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's think in terms of winning and losing positions. Let me denote a position as a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

Let's try to build a table for small n and see if we can find a pattern.

n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice, so Bob can't force a win. So n=1 is not counted.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Wait, but wait: no, wait, if Alice takes 1 from n=2, leaving 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, but she can't because there are only 2 tokens. So Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. So Bob takes 1 and wins. Wait, so for n=2, Alice can't win because whatever she does, Bob can take the remaining and win. Wait, that would mean n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. Wait, but wait.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: if n=1, Alice takes 1 and wins. So Bob can't win. For n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, but she can't because there are only 2 tokens. So Alice's only move is to take 1. So Bob can take the remaining 1 and win. So for n=2,
