Okay, so I have this problem with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). They form a triangle or something? The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. I need to find a point C on AB, not A or B, that's only on AB and no other segment from F. Then, find OC² and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm. Let's visualize this. Points O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So for each such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), where p and q are positive numbers, and the distance between them is 1. So sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, q = sqrt(1 - p²). So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)).

Wait, but p can vary from 0 to 1. So for each p in (0,1), we have a segment PQ with P=(p,0) and Q=(0, sqrt(1 - p²)). So these segments are all in the first quadrant, starting on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, other than A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So AB is a segment from A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me write the equation of AB.

Let me compute the equation of line AB. The coordinates are A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So that's the equation of AB.

Now, point C is on AB, so its coordinates can be parameterized. Let's say C is at (x, y), with x in [0, 1/2] and y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We need to find C such that it's not on any other segment PQ from F except AB.

So, AB is one of the segments in F? Let me check. AB has length sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1, so yes, AB is in F.

So, AB is part of the family F. So point C is on AB, and we need that it is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, to restate, for any other pair (P, Q) in F, the point C is not on PQ.

So, how can a point lie on multiple segments PQ from F? Each such PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)).

So, for C to lie on PQ, it must lie on the line connecting (p,0) and (0, sqrt(1 - p²)), and between those two points.

So, for each p in (0,1), we can write the equation of PQ as x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

Because the intercept form of a line is x/a + y/b =1 where a and b are intercepts on x and y axes.

So, for segment PQ, the equation is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

So, if point C (x, y) lies on this line, then x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

But since C is also on AB, which is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting y into the equation of PQ, we get x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

We can write this as [x/p] + [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - p²) ] = 1.

Let me rearrange terms:

x [ 1/p - sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 - p²) ] + [ sqrt(3)/2 / sqrt(1 - p²) ] = 1.

Let me denote sqrt(1 - p²) as s for a moment. So s = sqrt(1 - p²), which implies s² = 1 - p², so p² = 1 - s².

So, substituting:

x [ 1/p - sqrt(3)/s ] + [ sqrt(3)/(2s) ] = 1.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write this as:

x [ (1/p) - (sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 - p²)) ] + [ sqrt(3)/(2 sqrt(1 - p²)) ] = 1.

So, for a given p, this is an equation in x.

We can think of this as x multiplied by some coefficient plus another term equals 1.

But now, for point C on AB, we can parameterize it.

Let me parameterize AB. Let me let t be a parameter from 0 to 1, where t=0 is at A (1/2, 0) and t=1 is at B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equation can be written as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, for t in [0,1], this gives all points on AB.

So, point C can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t.

So, substituting into the equation for PQ, we have:

[ (1/2)(1 - t) ] / p + [ (sqrt(3)/2 t) ] / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

Multiply both sides by 2:

(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - p²) = 2.

So, this equation relates t and p.

Now, for point C to lie on PQ, this equation must hold for some p.

But we want that for all p ≠ p0 (where p0 corresponds to AB), this equation does not hold. So, AB corresponds to p0, which is... Wait, AB is the segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, what is p0?

Wait, in the family F, each segment PQ corresponds to a specific p. For AB, the x-intercept is 1/2, so p0 = 1/2.

So, the segment AB is the one with p = 1/2. Because P is (1/2, 0) and Q is (0, sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2 )) = (0, sqrt(3)/2), which matches point B.

So, for p = 1/2, the equation is:

(1 - t)/ (1/2) + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2 ) = 2.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting:

(1 - t)/(1/2) + (sqrt(3) t)/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2

Simplify each term:

(1 - t)/(1/2) = 2(1 - t)
(sqrt(3) t)/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 t

So, 2(1 - t) + 2t = 2

Which becomes 2 - 2t + 2t
