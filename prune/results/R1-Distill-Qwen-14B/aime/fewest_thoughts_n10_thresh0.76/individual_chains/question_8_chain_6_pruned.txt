Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me understand the constraints. We have three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers, adding up to 300. The second condition is a bit more complex: it's a sum of terms like a²b, a²c, etc. Let me see if I can factor that expression or rewrite it in a better way.

Looking at the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, I notice that each term is of the form (variable squared) multiplied by another variable. Maybe I can factor this somehow.

Wait, let me try to factor it:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression can be written as:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute that in:

So, the expression becomes:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

That's:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm. Let me rearrange this:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

So, now I have:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I need to find nonnegative integers a, b, c such that this equation holds along with a + b + c = 300.

I wonder if there's a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the condition a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of the sum and the sum of products.

Wait, I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, that's 300² = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Similarly, is there a formula for a³ + b³ + c³? I think so. Let me recall.

Yes, the formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

So, since a + b + c = 300, let's compute a³ + b³ + c³:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Compute 300³: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, 27,000,000.

So, substituting back into the earlier equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Which is:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - [27,000,000 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000

300*(-2(ab + bc + ca)) = -600(ab + bc + ca)

So, 300*(90,000 - 2(...)) = 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca)

Now, subtract [27,000,000 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc]:

So, 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Let me compute term by term:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0

-600(ab + bc + ca) + 900(ab + bc + ca) = 300(ab + bc + ca)

Then, -3abc.

So the entire expression becomes:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Let me factor out 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm, okay. So now, the equation reduces to:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Let me write that as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it differently.

Let me see: abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca = -2,000,000

Hmm, perhaps adding 100^3 to both sides to factor in a certain way? Let me think.

Wait, I remember that sometimes in such problems, we can use substitutions or consider symmetric functions. Let me denote x = a, y = b, z = c for simplicity.

So, equation becomes:

xyz - 100xy - 100yz - 100zx = -2,000,000

This can be rewritten as:

xyz - 100xy - 100yz - 100zx + 100^3 = -2,000,000 + 100^3

Compute 100^3: 1,000,000.

So, RHS becomes -2,000,000 + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

Now, the left side: xyz - 100xy - 100yz - 100zx + 100^3.

Hmm, perhaps this can be factored as (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100). Let me check:

(x - 100)(y - 100) = xy -100x -100y + 10,000

Multiply by (z -100):

= (xy -100x -100y + 10,000)(z -100)

= xy*z - 100x*z - 100y*z + 10,000z - 100x*y + 10,000x +10,000y - 1,000,000

Hmm, wait, let me compute step by step:

= xy*z -100x*z -100y*z + 10,000 z -100x*y + 10,000x +10,000 y -1,000,000

Wait, so that's:

xyz -100x z -100y z -100x y +10,000 z +10,000 x +10,000 y -1,000,000

But the left side of my equation is xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +100^3

Which is xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +1,000,000.

Comparing with the expansion of (x-100)(y-100)(z-100), which is xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +10,000x +10,000y +10,000z -1,000,000.

So, it's similar but with 10,000x +10,000y +10,000z instead of 1,000,000.

Wait, so perhaps I was wrong in adding 100^3. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps if I set x = a + 100, y = b + 100, z = c + 100, maybe that substitution can help? Let me try.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me define new variables:

Let’s set A = a + 100, B = b + 100, C = c + 100.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the equation as (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = something.

Wait, let me see:

From before, I have:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +1,000,000 = (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) + something.

Wait, actually, when I expanded (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100), I got:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +10,000x +10,000y +10,000z -1,000,000.

So, if I take that and subtract 10,000(x + y + z), I get:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx -10,000(x + y + z) -1,000,000.

Hmm, not sure that helps.

Alternatively, since my equation is:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +1,000,000 = -1,000,000

Wait, no, I had before:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

So, then:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +10,000x +10,000y +10,000z -1,000,000.

So, my equation is:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

Let me subtract 1,000,000 from both sides:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx = -2,000,000.

Which is the same as:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) -10,000(x + y + z) + 1,000,000 = -2,000,000.

Wait, not sure that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can write:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx = -2,000,000

But (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +10,000x +10,000y +10,000z -1,000,000

So, subtract 10,000(x + y + z) from both sides:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) -10,000(x + y + z)
