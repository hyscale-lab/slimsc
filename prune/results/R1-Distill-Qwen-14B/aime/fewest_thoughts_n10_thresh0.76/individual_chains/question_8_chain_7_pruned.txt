Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex. Let me try to break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, and I remember that the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = n is given by the combination formula C(n + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(n + 2, 2). But in this case, we also have the second condition involving a quadratic expression.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can factor or simplify this expression. I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. Maybe I can factor it differently.

Let me try grouping terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c).

So substituting, the expression becomes:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which simplifies to:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So the equation is:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. Let me factor that further:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and ab + bc + ca.

I remember the identity:
a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

So substituting that into the equation:
300(a² + b² + c²) - [(300)^3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (300)^3:
300^3 = 300 * 300 * 300 = 27,000,000

Now, let's compute the entire expression:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Expanding that:
300a² + 300b² + 300c² - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Let me move the 27,000,000 to the other side:
300a² + 300b² + 300c² + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000
Which simplifies to:
300a² + 300b² + 300c² + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out some terms.

Looking at the left-hand side, I see that each term is a multiple of 3. Let me factor out 3:

3[100a² + 100b² + 100c² + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 33,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:
100a² + 100b² + 100c² + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000

Hmm, still a bit messy. Let me see if I can find another way.

Wait, maybe instead of expanding, I can manipulate the original equation differently. Let's go back.

We have:
a + b + c = 300
and
a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Let me think about symmetric functions. The expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b is symmetric in a, b, c. Maybe it can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric functions.

I recall that the elementary symmetric functions are:
s1 = a + b + c
s2 = ab + bc + ca
s3 = abc

In our case, s1 = 300.

The expression given is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me try to express this in terms of s1, s2, s3.

Let me factor this expression as:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c) = a²(300 - a)
Similarly for the other terms.

So, the expression is:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which is the same as the earlier substitution. So, that gives:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Which can be written as:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

We also know that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of s1, s2, s3 as:

a³ + b³ + c³ = s1³ - 3s1s2 + 3s3

So substituting, we get:
300(a² + b² + c²) - [s1³ - 3s1s2 + 3s3] = 6,000,000

We know s1 = 300, so s1³ = 27,000,000.

So:
300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 3*300*s2 + 3s3] = 6,000,000

Expanding:
300a² + 300b² + 300c² - 27,000,000 + 900s2 - 3s3 = 6,000,000

Rearranging:
300(a² + b² + c²) + 900s2 - 3s3 = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000
Which is:
300(a² + b² + c²) + 900s2 - 3s3 = 33,000,000

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:
100(a² + b² + c²) + 300s2 - s3 = 11,000,000

Hmm, okay. Now, let's see if we can express a² + b² + c² in terms of s1 and s2.

We know that:
(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
So, a² + b² + c² = s1² - 2s2

Substituting s1 = 300:
a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2s2 = 90,000 - 2s2

So, plugging this back into our equation:
100(90,000 - 2s2) + 300s2 - s3 = 11,000,000

Compute 100*(90,000 - 2s2):
= 9,000,000 - 200s2

So, equation becomes:
9,000,000 - 200s2 + 300s2 - s3 = 11,000,000

Simplify the terms:
9,000,000 + 100s2 - s3 = 11,000,000

Rearranging:
100s2 - s3 = 11,000,000 - 9,000,000
100s2 - s3 = 2,000,000

So, 100s2 - s3 = 2,000,000

Hmm, so now I have an equation relating s2 and s3.

I need another equation to relate these variables. Let me think. We have s1 = 300, and s2 and s3 are the other symmetric sums. But without another equation, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can find a way to express s3 in terms of s2.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the variables a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so s2 = ab + bc + ca and s3 = abc.

Given that, maybe I can think about possible integer solutions for s2 and s3.

From the equation:
100s2 - s3 = 2,000,000
=> s3 = 100s2 - 2,000,000

So, s3 must be equal to 100s2 - 2,000,000.

Since s3 is nonnegative (as a, b, c are nonnegative integers), this implies that:
100s2 - 2,000,000 ≥ 0
=> s2 ≥ 20,000.

Also, s2 is ab + bc + ca, which is nonnegative, so s2 ≥ 0, but in this case, s2 must be ≥ 20,000.

Now, let's think about possible values of s2. Since s2 = ab + bc + ca, and a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can find bounds on s2.

I know that for fixed a + b + c, the maximum of ab + bc + ca occurs when the variables are as equal as possible. So for a + b + c = 300, the maximum of s2 is when a = b = c = 100, giving s2 = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 30,000.

Wait, but that's only 30,000. But from our previous equation, s2 must be at least 20,000. So, s2 can range from 20,000 to 30,000.

Hmm, and s3 must equal 100s2 - 2,000,000. So, when s2 is 20,000, s3 is 0. When s2 is 30,000, s3 is 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.

So, s3 ranges from 0 to 1,000,000 as s2 goes from 20,000 to 30,000.

Wait a minute, but let me check: when s2 is 30,000, s3 is 1,000,000. But for a, b, c nonnegative integers, is s3 = 1,000,000 possible?

Wait, s3 is abc. Let's think, if a, b, c are each 100, then abc would be 1,000,000. So yes, that's possible.

So, now, what do I know: s1 = 300, s2 is between 20,000 and 30,000, and s3 = 100s2 - 2,000,000.

Now, perhaps I can think about the possible triples (a, b, c) in terms of their symmetric sums. Since s1, s2, s3 are known, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is x³ - s1x² + s2x - s3 = 0.

So, the polynomial would be x³ - 300x² + s2x - (100s2 - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify that:

x³ - 300x² + s2x - 100s2 + 2,000,000 = 0

We can write this as:

x³ - 300x² + (s2)x + (-100s2 + 2,000,000) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can factor this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between a, b, c.

Wait, another approach: since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps we can consider cases where one or more of them are zero.

Case 1: All of a, b, c are positive integers.

Case 2: One of them is zero.

Case 3: Two of them are zero.

Case 4: All three are zero.

But given that a + b + c = 300, Cases 3 and 4 are trivial:

Case 3: If two variables are zero, say b = c = 0, then a = 300. Then, plug into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c
