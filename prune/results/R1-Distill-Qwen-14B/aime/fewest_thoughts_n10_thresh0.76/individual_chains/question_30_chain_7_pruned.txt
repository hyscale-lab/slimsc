Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a 13th root of unity is. A 13th root of unity is a complex number ω such that ω^13 = 1. These roots are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane. So, ω, ω^2, ..., ω^12 are all distinct and satisfy the equation x^13 = 1. Also, since ω ≠ 1, we're considering all the primitive roots except 1 itself.

Now, the product given is over all these roots, from k=0 to 12. But wait, when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so that term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1^0) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So, the first term in the product is 1. That might simplify things a bit because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. So, maybe I can focus on k=1 to 12 since k=0 contributes a factor of 1.

So, the product simplifies to the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm. Let's write that as:

Product = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I need to compute this product. Hmm. Maybe I can find a way to relate this product to some known polynomials or exploit properties of roots of unity.

Looking at the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me see if this can be simplified or factored.

Let me denote z = ω^k. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, z will be ω, ω^2, ..., ω^12, each of which is distinct and a root of z^13 = 1.

So, substituting z into the expression, we have:

2 - 2z + z^2.

So, the expression becomes z^2 - 2z + 2. Let me write this as a quadratic in z: z^2 - 2z + 2.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this quadratic or find its roots? Let me try.

The quadratic equation z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0 has discriminant D = (−2)^2 − 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are z = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i.

So, the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

Therefore, z^2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So, each term in the product is (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), where z = ω^k.

Therefore, the entire product becomes the product from k=1 to 12 of [(ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i))].

Which is equal to [Product_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [Product_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

So, if I can compute each of these two products separately, then I can multiply them together to get the final result.

Let me focus on one of them first, say Product_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)).

I remember that for roots of unity, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to n-1 is equal to x^n - 1. But in our case, we're taking the product from k=1 to 12, which excludes k=0. So, when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so (x - 1) is a factor of x^13 - 1. Therefore, the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

So, the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).

Therefore, substituting x = (1 + i):

Product_{k=1}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) = [( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) ].

Wait, but the product is ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1+i)) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} ( -( (1+i) - ω^k) ) = (-1)^{12} * Product_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 + i) - ω^k ).

Since (-1)^12 is 1, this is equal to Product_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 + i) - ω^k ), which is equal to [( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) ].

Wait, actually, let's double-check that. The product from k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). So, if x = (1 + i), then the product is [( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) ].

Similarly, for the other product, substituting x = (1 - i), we get [( (1 -
