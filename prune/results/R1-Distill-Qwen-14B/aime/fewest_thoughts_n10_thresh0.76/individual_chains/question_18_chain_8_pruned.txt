Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 sides, right? And it's regular, so all sides and angles are equal. The problem says that each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay. So, I need to count all possible rectangles where their sides are either sides or diagonals of this 12-sided figure.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n. So for n=12, it's (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. But maybe that's not too important right now.

Now, to form a rectangle, I need four points (vertices) of the dodecagon such that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, I think the key is to find pairs of parallel sides in the dodecagon because rectangles require opposite sides to be equal and parallel.

Wait, in a regular polygon, sides are all equal and angles are equal, but the diagonals vary in length depending on how many vertices they skip. So, in a dodecagon, the length of a diagonal can be different based on whether it connects two vertices with one vertex in between, two, three, etc.

But how does that help me form rectangles? Well, a rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides are parallel if they are separated by the same number of vertices. So, for example, in a dodecagon, if I pick a side, the side opposite to it (separated by six sides) is parallel because the polygon is regular. Similarly, diagonals can be parallel if they skip the same number of vertices.

Hmm, so maybe the first step is to figure out how many sets of parallel sides and diagonals exist in the dodecagon. Once I have that, I can find how many rectangles can be formed by choosing two sets of these parallel lines.

Wait, but rectangles are defined by two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being perpendicular to the other. So, in the case of a dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon, the angles between sides and diagonals might allow for rectangles when the angles are 90 degrees apart.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the central angles between consecutive vertices are 360/12 = 30 degrees apart. So each vertex is 30 degrees around the center from the next. So, the angle between two adjacent vertices from the center is 30 degrees.

Now, for a rectangle, I think the sides would need to be aligned such that their sides are either aligned with sides of the polygon or diagonals that create 90-degree angles with each other.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a circle. If we do that, then the vertices are equally spaced around the circumference. So, each vertex is at an angle of 30 degrees from the next. So, the
