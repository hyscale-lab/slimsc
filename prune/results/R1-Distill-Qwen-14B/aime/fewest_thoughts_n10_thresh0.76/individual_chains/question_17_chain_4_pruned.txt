Alright, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q. Finally, I have to find p + q where p and q are coprime.

Okay, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. So, we have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The question is about the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. The sphere must be able to contain each box in the set B, so the sphere's radius must be large enough to fit the largest possible box from B. Therefore, I need to find the maximum possible dimension of the boxes in B because the sphere's diameter must at least match the largest space diagonal of the box.

Wait, right, the sphere's diameter must be equal to the space diagonal of the box. So the radius would be half of that. So, to find the minimal sphere that can contain any box in B, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B. Then, the radius r is half of that maximum space diagonal.

So, first, let me recall the formulas for surface area and volume of a rectangular box. If the box has dimensions x, y, z, then:

- Surface area S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
- Volume V = xyz = 23

And the space diagonal D is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, D² = x² + y² + z².

Our goal is to maximize D, which would correspond to maximizing D². So, I need to maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints S = 54 and V = 23.

Hmm, okay. So, this is an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since we have three variables and two equations, we might be able to express two variables in terms of the third and then find the maximum.

But before getting into that, perhaps I can use inequalities to relate x² + y² + z² to the surface area or volume. Let's think about that.

I know that for positive numbers x, y, z, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality might come into play. Alternatively, maybe using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

Wait, another thought: perhaps introduce variables a = x + y + z, b = xy + yz + zx, c = xyz. So, we know that b = 54/2 = 27. And c = 23. So, b is 27, c is 23.

We need to find x² + y² + z², which is equal to (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = a² - 2b. Since b is 27, this becomes a² - 54. Therefore, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize a², which means maximizing a, the sum x + y + z.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of a = x + y + z, given that b = 27 and c = 23.

Hmm, so I need to maximize a given that for positive numbers x, y, z:

- xy + yz + zx = 27
- xyz = 23

And find the maximum possible a.

Is there a way to express a in terms of these? I'm not sure, but perhaps I can think of x, y, z as roots of a cubic equation.

Yes, if x, y, z are the roots of the equation t³ - at² + bt - c = 0. Substituting the known values, the equation becomes t³ - a t² + 27 t - 23 = 0.

So, the cubic equation is t³ - a t² + 27 t - 23 = 0.

We need to find the maximum possible a such that all roots of this equation are positive real numbers.

Wait, but how can I find the maximum a? Maybe by using inequalities related to the roots of the cubic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the relationship between the roots. For positive real roots, certain conditions must hold. For example, by AM ≥ GM, we have (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^{1/3}.

Let me compute that. (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (23)^{1/3}.

So, a/3 ≥ cube root of 23.

Cube root of 23 is approximately 2.84, so a ≥ 3 * 2.84 ≈ 8.52.

But that's the minimum a, not the maximum. So, that doesn't directly help me, but it's a starting point.

Wait, perhaps we can use the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the harmonic mean.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for positive real numbers, if we fix the product and the sum of products, the sum can vary.

Wait, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Since we have to maximize a = x + y + z, given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Yes, that's a possible approach.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. Let’s define the function to maximize as f(x, y, z) = x + y + z, subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

So, the Lagrangian is L = x + y + z - λ (xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ (xyz - 23).

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 1 - λ(y + z) - μ yz = 0
∂L/∂y = 1 - λ(x + z) - μ xz = 0
∂L/∂z = 1 - λ(x + y) - μ xy = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 1 = λ(y + z) + μ yz
2. 1 = λ(x + z) + μ xz
3. 1 = λ(x + y) + μ xy

Let me subtract the first equation from the second:

1 - 1 = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(xz - yz)
0 = λ(x - y) + μ z (x - y)
0 = (x - y)(λ + μ z)

So, either x = y or λ + μ z = 0.

Similarly, subtracting the second equation from the third:

0 = (z - y)(λ + μ x)

So, either z = y or λ + μ x = 0.

Similarly, subtracting the first equation from the third:

0 = (z - x)(λ + μ y)

So, either z = x or λ + μ y = 0.

Hmm, so from these, we have either all variables equal, or some other conditions. Let's consider the symmetric case where x = y = z.

If x = y = z, then let's see what happens. Then, the surface area would be 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, x = 3. Then the volume would be 3x3 = 27, but in our problem, the volume is 23. So, that's not the case.

Therefore, the case where x = y = z is not possible because it would give volume 27, which is greater than 23. So, the maximum a must occur when the variables are not all equal.

So, perhaps two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's suppose that x = y ≠ z. Then, let's see what happens.

If x = y, then:

The surface area equation: 2(x² + 2xz) = 54
Volume: x² z = 23

So, from surface area: x² + 2xz = 27 → x² + 2xz = 27.

From volume: z = 23 / x².

Substituting into surface area equation: x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27 → x² + (46 / x) = 27.

Multiply both sides by x: x³ + 46 = 27x → x³ -27x +46 =0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation.

Let me see if there are any rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46=0 → 0. So x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor x³ -27x +46 = (x -2)(x² + 2x -23).

Now, solving x² + 2x -23=0.

Discriminant: 4 + 92=96. So, x=(-2 ±√96)/2 = (-2 ± 4√6)/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

Since x must be positive, x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

So, the roots are x=2 and x=-1 ±2√6. We take the positive ones, x=2 and x≈3.898.

So, when x = y = 2, then z = 23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box dimensions are 2, 2, 5.75.

Alternatively, when x = y ≈3.898, then z=23/(3.898)^2.

Wait, let me compute that:

First, x ≈3.898, so x² ≈ (3.898)^2 ≈15.19.

Then, z =23 /15.19
