Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so the first thing I'm thinking is that this involves circles, tangents, and triangle properties. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D must be the ex-pole or something related to the triangle. Hmm, maybe the ex-tangent point?

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, in this case, DB and DC should be equal because they're both tangents from D to circle ω.

Wait, but in this case, D is the intersection point of the two tangents at B and C. So, that means DB is tangent at B and DC is tangent at C. So, yes, DB = DC.

So, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle with DB = DC.

But how does that help me with triangle ABC?

Maybe I can use some properties related to power of a point. The power of point D with respect to circle ω should be equal to DB² or DC² because D lies on the tangents from B and C.

Let me recall the power of a point theorem: the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC², as mentioned. Also, the power is equal to DA * DP, since AD is a secant that intersects ω at A and P. So, Power of D: DB² = DA * DP.

So, DB² = DA * DP. That seems useful because if I can find DB, and if I can express DA in terms of other known quantities, I can solve for DP. Then, since AP = DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, AP is part of the secant. Wait, the points are A, P, and then the other intersection is P. Wait, actually, AD starts at A, goes through P, and intersects the circle again at P. Wait, no, the circle is ω, which is the circumcircle of ABC. So, AD is a line from A through P, which is another point on ω. So, AP is a chord from A to P, with AD passing through P. So, the power of point D is DA * DP = DB², but I'm a bit confused about the notation here.

Wait, actually, in the power of a point formula, if a line through D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. In this case, the line is AD, which intersects the circle at A and P. So,
