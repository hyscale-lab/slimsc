Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which will be in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.

Hmm. First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. This distance is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think the formula is similar to the 2D case. In 2D, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In 3D, I believe the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume V divided by the total surface area S. So, r = 3V / S.

So, my plan is to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, then compute r = 3V/S.

But first, I need to find V and S. The surface area S is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. The volume V can be found using coordinates, perhaps, or maybe through some formula.

Given the edge lengths, this tetrahedron seems symmetric. AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So, it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, maybe a disphenoid. I recall that in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, but wait, is that true?

Wait, no. In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, which is the case here. So, yes, it's a disphenoid. But in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent triangles. Let me check: each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. Let's compute if these can form a triangle.

Wait, √41 ≈ 6.4, √80 ≈ 8.94, √89 ≈ 9.43. So, 6.4 + 8.94 > 9.43? 6.4 +8.94=15.34>9.43 yes. Similarly, others hold, so yes, triangles are possible. So, all four faces are congruent.

Therefore, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. So, the area of each face is the same. So, maybe I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four to get the total surface area S.

So, first, compute area of a face. Let's take triangle ABC. Its sides are AB=√41, BC=√89, and AC=√80.

Wait, no, actually, wait, in the tetrahedron, ABC is a face, but AB=√41, BC=√89, and AC=√80. So that's correct. So, all four faces are triangles with side lengths √41, √80, √89. So, each face is congruent.

So, the area of one face can be found using Heron's formula. Let's compute that.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s of the triangle:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

Wait, but computing Heron's formula with square roots might be messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is right-angled? Let's check.

In a triangle with sides a,
