Okay, so I've got this geometry problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to visualize what's going on.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, the triangle is ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, let me sketch this in my mind: triangle ABC, with side lengths 5, 9, 10. It's inscribed in a circle, which means it's a circumcircle passing through all three points.

Tangents at B and C meet at D. So, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. Then, line AD is drawn, and it intersects the circumcircle again at P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with ω.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a common external point to a circle, the lengths of these tangents are equal. So, DB = DC because D is the external point, and the tangents from D to ω are equal in length.

I think the key here is to use power of a point. The power of point D with respect to circle ω should be equal to DB² and DC² since DB and DC are tangent lengths. Also, since D is outside the circle, the power of D is DB² = DC² = DA * DP, because AD is a secant intersecting the circle at A and P.

Wait, so Power of a Point says that for point D outside the circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the product of the lengths of the entire secant segment and its external part. So, DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, then I can express DP in terms of DA, and since DA is equal to AP + something, but wait, no. Actually, DA is from D to A, and DP is the segment from D to P, so DA is part of DP. Wait, no. Let me think.

Actually, the power of point D is DB² = DA * DP. Because AD is a secant that goes through A and then P. So, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DA is part of DP, but DP is longer. Or wait, is it the other way around?

Wait, if A is on the circle, then from point D, line DA passes through A and goes to P on the circle. So, DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DP = DA + AP? No, that can't be because P is on the extension beyond A.

Wait, no. If D is outside the circle, and line AD passes through the circle at A and P, so from D, the line goes through A and then exits the circle
