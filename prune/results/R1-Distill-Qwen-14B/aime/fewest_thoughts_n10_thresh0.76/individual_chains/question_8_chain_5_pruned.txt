Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It says: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what is being asked here. I need to find all possible triples (a, b, c) where each of a, b, and c are nonnegative integers. They must add up to 300, and another condition involving their squares and products must also hold.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I think the second equation can be factored or simplified somehow. Let me look closely.

Looking at the second equation, I can factor out terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression is a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Wait, since a + b + c = 300, that means b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That's an interesting form. Let me expand each term:

For a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly for the other terms:

So the entire expression becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me write that as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³.

I also know that a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can find other symmetric sums to relate these.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So let's write that down.

Let S = a + b + c = 300,
P = ab + bc + ac,
Q = abc.

We also have a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

Wait, that's a formula I might be able to use. Let me write that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q.

So, substituting into our earlier equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q) = 6,000,000.

But I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of S and P as well.

From (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac), so:

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P.

Substituting that into the equation:

300(S² - 2P) - (S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step. Since S is 300, let's plug that in.

First, compute S² = 300² = 90,000.

So, 300(S² - 2P) = 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600 P.

Then, the term (S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q) is:

300³ - 3*300*P + 3 Q.

Compute 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So, S³ = 27,000,000.

3 S P = 3*300*P = 900 P.

So, the entire term is 27,000,000 - 900 P + 3 Q.

Putting it all back into the equation:

[27,000,000 - 600 P] - [27,000,000 - 900 P + 3 Q] = 6,000,000.

Let me simplify this step by step.

First, distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600 P - 27,000,000 + 900 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.

Now, combine like terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0.

-600 P + 900 P = 300 P.

And then -3 Q.

So, the equation becomes:

300 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.

We can factor out 3:

3(100 P - Q) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, Q = 100 P - 2,000,000.

Now, I have expressions for S, P, and Q in terms of each other.

But I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy these conditions.

Wait, Q is abc. So, Q must be non-negative because a, b, c are nonnegative integers.

Therefore, 100 P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0.

Which implies P ≥ 20,000.

Hmm, okay. So P must be at least 20,000.

Also, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P is the sum of the products of pairs, so P can be as large as when two variables are 150 and one is 0, but let's see.

Wait, actually, for maximum P, when two variables are as large as possible given a + b + c = 300.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the possible range of P.

But maybe I can find another relation. Let me think.

I have S = 300, so P is ab + bc + ac.

We can also relate this to the equation:

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So,

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

Wait, earlier, we had a² + b² + c² expressed in terms of S and P.

But let me think about another approach. Maybe using symmetric polynomials.

Wait, but perhaps I can think in terms of variables being equal or different. Maybe some variables are zero.

Wait, the problem allows nonnegative integers, so some of a, b, c could be zero. Let me think about that.

Suppose one of them is zero. Let's say c = 0. Then a + b = 300, and the second condition becomes a²b + b²a = 6,000,000.

Wait, but if c=0, then the second equation is a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0 + 0 = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b).

Since a + b = 300, as c=0, then the equation becomes ab * 300 = 6,000,000.

So, 300 ab = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300: ab = 20,000.

So, if c=0, then a + b = 300 and ab=20,000.

So, the number of solutions when c=0 is the number of nonnegative integer pairs (a, b) such that a + b = 300 and ab=20,000.

Similarly, same logic applies if a=0 or b=0. So, I can compute the number of solutions when one variable is zero and then multiply by 3, but I have to be careful about cases where more than one variable is zero, but in this case, if two variables are zero, say a=0 and b=0, then c=300, but then the second equation would be 0, which is not 6,000,000, so such cases are impossible. So, only cases where exactly one variable is zero contribute.

So, let me compute the number of solutions when c=0.

We have a + b = 300, ab=20,000.

These are nonnegative integers a, b. So, let me write a quadratic equation.

Let a and b be roots of x² - (a + b)x + ab = 0.

So, x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Compute discriminant D = 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Square root of D is 100.

So, roots are [300 ± 100]/2.

So, (300 + 100)/2 = 400/2 = 200.

(300 - 100)/2 = 200/2 = 100.

So, the solutions are a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200.

So, when c=0, there are two solutions: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0).

Similarly, when a=0, the equation becomes:

b + c = 300,

b²c + c²b = 6,000,000.

Which is bc(b + c) = 6,000,000.

So, bc*300 = 6,000,000.

Thus, bc = 20,000.

So, same as before, the number of solutions is two: (0,200,100) and (0,100,200).

Similarly, when b=
