Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about finding the greatest four-digit number, let's call it N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I need to find Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, I have to add Q and R together to get the answer.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the largest such number with the given property. The property is that changing any one digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means if I take N and replace the thousands digit with 1, the number is divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing the hundreds digit, the tens digit, or the units digit with 1 should also result in a number divisible by 7.

Wait, so N has four digits: let's denote them as A, B, C, D. So, N = ABCD, where A is the thousands digit, B is the hundreds, C is tens, and D is units. Then, when we replace any one digit with 1, the number becomes 1BCD, A1CD, AB1D, or ABC1, and each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, the problem is to find the maximum ABCD such that replacing any single digit with 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this. Maybe I can write down conditions for each possible replacement.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we replace the thousands digit with 1, we get M1 = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. Similarly, replacing the hundreds digit gives M2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D. Replacing the tens digit gives M3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D. Replacing the units digit gives M4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these numbers M1, M2, M3, M4 must be divisible by 7. So, M1 ≡ 0 mod 7, M2 ≡ 0 mod 7, M3 ≡ 0 mod 7, M4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, let's write these congruence equations.

1. M1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. M2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. M3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. M4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, I have four congruence equations.

I think perhaps I can express each of these in terms of N and the digit being changed. Let me see.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute each M1, M2, M3, M4 in terms of N and the digit position.

Wait, for example, M1 is N with the thousands digit replaced by 1. So, the thousands digit was A, now it's 1. So, M1 = N - (A - 1)*1000.

Similarly, M2 = N - (B - 1)*100.

M3 = N - (C - 1)*10.

M4 = N - (D - 1)*1.

So, each of these is N minus some amount, which depends on the digit being changed and its place value.

Then, each of these M1, M2, M3, M4 must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

So,

1. N - (A - 1)*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N - (B - 1)*100 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N - (C - 1)*10 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N - (D - 1)*1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, rearranging each of these:

1. N ≡ (A - 1)*1000 mod 7
2. N ≡ (B - 1)*100 mod 7
3. N ≡ (C - 1)*10 mod 7
4. N ≡ (D - 1)*1 mod 7

Hmm, interesting. So, N must satisfy all four of these congruences.

So, N must be congruent to:

- (A - 1)*1000 mod 7
- (B - 1)*100 mod 7
- (C - 1)*10 mod 7
- (D - 1) mod 7

Therefore, all four of these expressions must be equal to N mod 7.

So, that means:

(A - 1)*1000 ≡ (B - 1)*100 ≡ (C - 1)*10 ≡ (D - 1) mod 7.

So, all four expressions are congruent to each other mod 7.

Therefore, I can set up equations between them.

First, let's compute the coefficients mod 7, since 1000, 100, 10, and 1 can be reduced mod 7.

Compute 1000 mod 7: Let's see, 1000 divided by 7. Well, 7*142=994, 1000-994=6. So 1000≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100/7 is 14*7=98, so 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, because 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, substituting, the congruences become:

(A -1)*6 ≡ (B -1)*2 ≡ (C -1)*3 ≡ (D -1) mod7.

So, let me denote this common value as k mod7. So:

(A -1)*6 ≡ k mod7,

(B -1)*2 ≡ k mod7,

(C -1)*3 ≡ k mod7,

(D -1) ≡ k mod7.

So, I can write each equation as:

(A -1)*6 ≡ k,

(B -1)*2 ≡ k,

(C -1)*3 ≡ k,

(D -1) ≡ k.

So, each of these must be equal to k mod7.

So, perhaps I can express each digit in terms of k.

Let me solve for each digit:

From first equation: (A -1)*6 ≡ k mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, the inverse exists. 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse of 6 is 6.

So, A -1 ≡ 6k mod7.

Similarly, second equation: (B -1)*2 ≡ k mod7.

Inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So, B -1 ≡4k mod7.

Third equation: (C -1)*3 ≡k mod7.

Inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So, C -1 ≡5k mod7.

Fourth equation: D -1 ≡k mod7.

So, D ≡k +1 mod7.

So, now, I can express each digit in terms of k.

So,

A ≡1 +6k mod7,

B ≡1 +4k mod7,

C ≡1 +5k mod7,

D ≡1 +k mod7.

Since A, B, C, D are digits, each must be between 0 and 9, but A cannot be 0 because N is a four-digit number.

Wait, so A is at least 1 and at most 9. Similarly, B, C, D are 0 to 9.

So, the digits are:

A = 1 +6k +7m,

B = 1 +4k +7n,

C =1 +5k +7p,

D=1 +k +7q,

where m, n, p, q are integers such that each digit is between 0 and 9 (note that for A, m can be 0 or 1 because 6k can be up to 6*6=36, but wait, k is mod7, so k can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, let's think about k. Since k must be such that D is a digit, D=1 +k +7q. Since D is a digit between 0 and 9, let's find possible k.

Wait, since k is mod7, k can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

But D=1 +k +7q. Since D must be between 0 and 9, let's see the possible values.

If q=0, D=1 +k, which can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 when k=0,...,6.

If q=1, D=1 +k +7. So, 8,9,10,11,12,13,14. But D needs to be a single digit, so maximum 9. So, k can be such that 1 +k +7 ≤9 → k ≤1.

Similarly, q can be negative? Well, if q=-1, D=1 +k -7. So, possible only when 1 +k -7 ≥0 → k ≥6. Then D would be 1 +k -7= k -6. So, for k=6, D=0; for k=7, D=1, but k is mod7, so k=6 is the maximum. So, D can be 0 if k=6 and q=-1.

But digits can't be negative. So, D must be between 0 and9, so q can be 0 or 1, but for some k, q might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider each possible k from 0 to6 and see what digits A,B,C,D would be, ensuring that each is between 0 and9, with A>=1.

So, let's proceed step by step.

Possible k: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

For each k, compute A, B, C, D.

Compute A = 1 +6k mod7. But wait, A can be 1 +6k +7m, but since 6k mod7 is fixed, but to get A as a digit, we can let A= (1 +6k) mod7, but considering that A must be 1-9, but wait, actually, A must be a single digit, so perhaps A = (1 +6k) mod7, if that gives a digit between1-9, but since 6k mod7 can be 0-6, so 1 +6k mod7 can be 1-7. So, A can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Similarly for B, C, D.

Wait, but perhaps the expressions A=1 +6k, but mod7. Hmm, maybe I should re-express each digit as:

A ≡1 +6k mod7,

B ≡1 +4k mod7,

C ≡1 +5k mod7,

D ≡1 +k mod7.

But since A must be a digit from1-9, and similar for B, C, D.

So, perhaps each digit is equal to its congruence mod7, but can be higher by multiples of7.

Wait, but since A is between1-9, if 1 +6k is greater than9, then it's not possible. So, let's compute each digit for each k.

Let me make a table for each k from0 to6:

k | A=1+6k mod7 | A_possible | B=1+4k mod7 | B_possible | C=1+5k mod7 | C_possible | D=1+k mod7 | D_possible
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
0 |1+0=1 →1 |1,8 (since 1 +7=8) |1+0=1 →1,8 |1,8 |1+0=1 →1,8 |1,8 |1+0=1 |1,8
1 |1+6=7 |7 |1+4=5 →5,12 (but 12 is invalid, so 5) |5 |1+5=6 |6 |1+1=2 |2,9
2 |1+12=13≡6 mod7→6 |6,13 invalid, so 6 |1+8=9≡2 mod7→2 |2,9 |1+10=11≡4 mod7→4 |4,11 invalid, so4 |1+2=3→3,10 invalid, so3
3 |1+18=19≡5 mod7→5 |5,12 invalid, so5 |1+12=13≡6 mod7→6 |6,13 invalid, so6 |1+15=16≡2 mod7→2 |2,9 |1+3=4→4,11 invalid, so4
4 |1+24=25≡4 mod7→4 |4,11 invalid, so4 |1+16=17≡3 mod7→3 |3,10 invalid, so3 |1+20=21≡0 mod7→0 |0,7 |1+4=5→5,12 invalid, so5
5 |1+30=31≡3 mod7→3 |3,10 invalid, so3 |1+20=21≡0 mod7→0 |0,7 |1+25=26≡5 mod7→5 |5,12 invalid, so5 |1+5=6→6,13 invalid, so6
6 |1+36=37≡2 mod7→2 |2,9 |1+24=25≡4 mod7→4 |4,11 invalid, so4 |1+30=31≡3 mod7→3 |3,10 invalid, so3 |1+6=7→7,14 invalid, so7

Wait, but this way, each digit can be either the mod7 value or that plus7, but not exceeding 9. For example, for k=0:

A =1,8; B=1,8; C=1,8; D=1,8.

Similarly, for k=1:

A=7; B=5; C=6; D=2,9.

Wait, but D for k=1 is 2 or9.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that each digit can be either the base value (mod7) or that plus7, but not more than9.

So, for each k, each digit can have multiple possibilities.

But since we need N to be the greatest four-digit number, we should choose the maximum possible digits.

So, perhaps for each k, we can compute the maximum possible N as 1000A +100B +10C +D, with A, B, C, D as large as possible.

Therefore, for each k from0 to6, compute the maximum possible digits A, B, C, D, and then compute N, and then find the maximum N across all k.

So, let's go through each k:

k=0:

A can be1 or8.

B can be1 or8.

C can be1 or8.

D can be1 or8.

But to maximize N, we want the largest possible digits.

So, A=8, B=8, C=8, D=8.

So N=8888.

But wait, let's check if this N satisfies the original condition: that changing any digit to1 makes it divisible by7.

Wait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's first check for each k.

But wait, perhaps it's better to compute N for each k, taking the maximum possible digits, and then check whether they satisfy their congruencies.

Wait, but perhaps I can proceed as follows:

For each k in 0 to6:

Compute the maximum possible A, B, C, D for each digit, given the constraints from their congruence.

Then, compute N as the four-digit number, then check if N satisfies the four conditions.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute N for each k and then check.

But let's proceed.

k=0:

A=8, B=8, C=8, D=8.

So, N=8888.

Now, check if replacing each digit with1 gives a number divisible by7.

So, M1=1888. Is 1888 divisible by7?

Let's compute 1888 /7.

7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. So, remainder5. Not divisible.

So, N=8888 with k=0 doesn't satisfy the condition.

So, k=0 is invalid.

k=1:

A=7, B=5, C=6, D=9.

So, N=7 5 6 9 →7569.

Check if replacing each digit with1 gives a number divisible by7.

Compute M1=1569.

1569 /7: 7*224=1568, 1569-1568=1. Not divisible.

So, M1 not divisible by7. So, N=7569 is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe D can be2 instead of9, but 2 is smaller. Let's try D=2.

So, N=7562.

Check M1=1562.

1562 /7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. Not divisible.

Hmm, not good.

So, k=1 doesn't work.

k=2:

A=6, B=2, C=4, D=3.

So, N=6243.

Check M1=1243.

1243/7: 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4. Not divisible.

Alternatively, maybe higher digits.

Wait, for k=2:

A can be6 or13, but 13 is invalid, so A=6.

B can be2 or9.

C can be4 or11 (invalid), so C=4.

D can be3 or10 (invalid), so D=3.

So, maximum N is6 9 4 3 →6943.

Check M1=1943.

1943/7: 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4. Not divisible.

Hmm, not good.

Alternatively, perhaps if we take B=9, but then N=6 9 4 3.

Same as before, M1=1943. Not divisible.

So, k=2 gives invalid N.

k=3:

A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4.

So, N=5624.

Check M1=1624.

1624 /7: 7*232=1624. Yes, exactly. So, M1 is divisible.

Now check M2: Replace B with1: 5124. Is that divisible by7?

5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124. Exactly, so yes.

M3: Replace C with1: 5614.

5614 ÷7: Let's compute 7*802=5614. So yes, exactly.

M4: Replace D with1: 5621.

5621 ÷7: 7*803=5621. So yes.

Wow, so N=5624 satisfies all four conditions.

But wait, is this the maximum N? Maybe higher N exists with a higher k.

Let's proceed to check other k's.

k=4:

A=4, B=3, C=0, D=5.

Wait, C=0? But digits can be 0, but let's see.

So, N=4305.

Check M1=1305.

1305 ÷7: 7*186=1302, 1305-1302=3. Not divisible.

So, N=4305 invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps higher digits.

Wait, for k=4:

A=4 or 11 (invalid), so A=4.

B=3 or10 (invalid), so B=3.

C=0 or7, so C=7.

D=5 or12 (invalid), so D=5.

So, N=4 3 7 5 →4375.

Check M1=1375.

1375 ÷7: 7*196=1372, 1375-1372=3. Not divisible.

Hmm, doesn't work.

k=4 seems invalid.

k=5:

A=3, B=0, C=5, D=6.

So, N=3056.

Check M1=1056.

1056 ÷7: 7*150=1050, 1056-1050=6. Not divisible.

Alternatively, higher digits:

A=3 or10 (invalid), so A=3.

B=0 or7, so B=7.

C=5 or12 (invalid), so C=5.

D=6 or13 (invalid), so D=6.

So, N=3 7 5 6 →3756.

Check M1=1756.

1756 ÷7: 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6. Not divisible.

So, k=5 invalid.

k=6:

A=2, B=4, C=3, D=7.

So, N=2 4 3 7 →2437.

Check M1=1437.

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. Not divisible.

Alternatively, higher digits:

A=2 or9, so A=9.

B=4 or11 (invalid), so B=4.

C=3 or10 (invalid), so C=3.

D=7 or14 (invalid), so D=7.

So, N=9 4 3 7 →9437.

Check M1=1437.

Same as before, 1437 not divisible by7.

Alternatively, maybe higher digits:

Wait, B can be4 or11, but 11 invalid. So, B=4.

C=3 or10 invalid.

D=7 or14 invalid.

So, N=9437.

M1=1437: not divisible.

Hmm, not good.

Alternatively, perhaps other possibilities for digits.

Wait, for k=6:

A=2 or9.

B=4 or11 invalid.

C=3 or10 invalid.

D=7 or14 invalid.

So, the maximum N for k=6 is 9 4 3 7 →9437.

But M1=1437 not divisible by7.

So, perhaps k=6 is invalid.

So, among all k, only k=3 gives a valid N=5624.

Wait, but is that the maximum? Because I thought N=5624, but maybe there exists a higher N with a higher k.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine k=3.

For k=3:

A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4.

So, N=5624.

Check M1=1624: divisible.

M2=5124: divisible.

M3=5614: divisible.

M4=5621: divisible.

So, yes, N=5624 is valid.

But wait, is there a higher N? Maybe a higher N with the same k=3 but higher digits.

Wait, for k=3:

A=5 or12 (invalid).

B=6 or13 (invalid).

C=2 or9.

D=4 or11 (invalid).

So, for C=9, N would be 5 6 9 4 →5694.

Check if this works.

Compute M1=1694.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. Exactly. So, M1 is good.

M2=5194.

5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Exactly.

M3=5614.

Wait, no, M3 is replacing C with1: 5614.

Wait, 5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Exactly.

M4=5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Exactly.

So, N=5694 also satisfies the condition.

Wait, so N=5694 is higher than 5624.

Hmm, so I must have missed this possibility earlier.

So, for k=3, C=9 is possible, giving N=5694.

So, that's a higher N.

Is this the maximum? Let's see if higher N exists.

Wait, can I have a higher N with k=3?

A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

Is there a way to get higher digits?

Wait, A=5 is fixed as per k=3.

Wait, is there a way to have A= higher than5? For k=3, A=5 or 12 (invalid). So, A=5 is the maximum.

Similarly, B=6 is fixed.

C=9 is allowed, as 1+5k=1+15=16≡2 mod7, but 2+7=9, which is allowed.

D=4 is fixed.

So, N=5694 is the maximum for k=3.

But wait, can we have a higher N with other k's?

Wait, I found N=5694 for k=3.

Let me check other k's again, perhaps I missed higher N.

Wait, for k=5:

A=3, B=0 or7, so B=7.

C=5 or12 invalid.

D=6 or13 invalid.

So, N=3756.

Wait, but 3756 is less than 5694.

Similarly, for k=6:

A=2 or9.

Wait, N=9437. Let's check this.

Wait, for k=6:

A=9 (since 1 +6k=1+36=37≡2 mod7, but 2+7=9, so A=9.

B=4 or11 invalid.

C=3 or10 invalid.

D=7 or14 invalid.

So, N=9437.

Check the conditions.

M1=1437.

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, remainder2. Not divisible.

So, N=9437 invalid.

So, no good.

k=4:

A=4 or11 invalid.

B=3 or10 invalid.

C=0 or7.

D=5 or12 invalid.

So, N=4375.

Check M1=1375.

1375 ÷7: 7*196=1372, remainder3. Not good.

So, invalid.

k=2:

A=6 or13 invalid.

B=2 or9.

C=4 or11 invalid.

D=3 or10 invalid.

So, N=6 9 4 3 →6943.

Check M1=1943.

1943 ÷7: 7*277=1939, remainder4. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

k=1:

N=7569.

As before, M1=1569: 1569 ÷7=224.142... remainder1.

Not good.

So, the only valid N's found are 5624 and 5694.

Between these, 5694 is higher.

Is there a higher N? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps for k=3, can we have higher digits than 5694?

A is fixed at5, B at6, C at9, D at4.

Is there a way to get a higher D?

D=4 or11 invalid.

So, no.

What about B? For k=3, B=6 or13 invalid. So, B=6 is maximum.

C=9 is allowed.

So, 5694 is the maximum for k=3.

Is there any other k where N can be higher than5694?

Well, let's think about k=3, but perhaps with A higher than5.

Wait, A=5 is from 1 +6k mod7. For k=3, 1+6*3=19≡5 mod7. To get A higher, like6 or7, we need k such that 1 +6k ≡6 or7 mod7.

Wait, 1 +6k ≡6 mod7 →6k≡5 mod7 →k≡5*6^{-1} mod7.

Since 6^{-1}=6 mod7, as 6*6=36≡1.

So, 6k≡5 →k≡5*6=30≡2 mod7.

So, k=2.

Similarly, for A=7: 1 +6k≡0 mod7 →6k≡6 mod7→k≡1 mod7.

So, k=1.

But for k=2, as we saw earlier, N=6943, which didn't satisfy the condition.

Similarly, for k=1, N=7569 didn't satisfy.

So, only for k=3, N=5694 is valid and higher than others.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a higher N with k=3 but with higher digits.

Wait, N=5694 is the maximum for k=3.

But wait, is 5694 the maximum possible four-digit number with this property?

Wait, what about N=7777.

If I change any digit to1, does it become divisible by7?

For example, M1=1777.

1777 ÷7: 7*253=1771, 1777-1771=6. Not divisible.

So, no.

Similarly, N=7770.

But digits can't be0 in thousands place.

Wait, N=7744.

Changing any digit to1: M1=1744.

1744 ÷7: 7*249=1743, remainder1. Not good.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps N=7721.

But I'm just guessing now.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Is there a way to find N=abcd, such that changing any digit to1 gives a multiple of7.

We found N=5694 as a candidate.

Is there a higher N?

Wait, let's see. Let's try N=7744.

As before, M1=1744. 1744 mod7: 1744-7*249=1744-1743=1. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

N=7721.

M1=1721. 1721 ÷7: 7*245=1715, 1721-1715=6. Not divisible.

Nope.

Wait, N=7700.

M1=1700. 1700 ÷7=242.857... Not divisible.

No.

Hmm, maybe N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let's test N=7744 again.

Wait, but I think I need a better approach.

Alternatively, let's consider that N must satisfy four conditions:

N ≡ (A-1)*1000 mod7,

N ≡ (B-1)*100 mod7,

N ≡ (C-1)*10 mod7,

N ≡ (D-1) mod7.

But since all four must be equal to k, which is N mod7.

Wait, perhaps we can find N mod7 as k.

But N=abcd.

Wait, but maybe I can write N as 1000A +100B +10C +D.

And from the four conditions, N ≡ (A-1)*1000 mod7,

But 1000 ≡6 mod7, so N ≡6(A-1) mod7.

Similarly, N≡2(B-1) mod7,

N≡3(C-1) mod7,

N≡(D-1) mod7.

So, setting all equal to k.

So,

6(A-1) ≡2(B-1) ≡3(C-1) ≡(D-1) ≡k mod7.

So, as before.

So, for N=5694,

A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

Compute k:

From D: D-1=3, so k=3.

Check:

6(A-1)=6*4=24≡3 mod7.

2(B-1)=2*5=10≡3 mod7.

3(C-1)=3*8=24≡3 mod7.

(D-1)=3.

So, all equal to3 mod7. So, correct.

So, N=5694 is a solution.

But is it the maximum?

Wait, perhaps I can try higher N with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

Is D=4 the maximum for k=3? Let's see.

D=4 or11 (invalid). So, D=4 is maximum.

What about C=9.

Yes, that's the maximum possible.

B=6 is maximum for B.

A=5 is maximum for A.

So, N=5694 is the maximum for k=3.

Is there a higher N with a different k? We saw that for k=6, N=9437 didn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, perhaps N=7721.

Wait, let's see.

N=7721.

Check M1=1721.

1721 ÷7: 7*245=1715, remainder6. Not divisible.

So, no.

Alternatively, maybe N=7700.

M1=1700. 1700 ÷7: 7*242=1694, remainder6. Not good.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps N=7694.

Wait, let's compute.

N=7694.

Check M1=1694. 1694 ÷7=242, exactly. So, M1 is good.

M2=7194. 7194 ÷7=1027.714... Not an integer. 7*1027=7189, 7194-7189=5. So, not divisible.

So, N=7694 invalid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7643.

M1=1643. 1643 ÷7: 7*234=1638, remainder5. Not divisible.

No.

Wait, perhaps N=7614.

M1=1614. 1614 ÷7: 7*230=1610, remainder4. Not good.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7585.

M1=1585. 1585 ÷7=226.428... Not integer.

Wait, perhaps this trial and error isn't effective.

Let me think again.

So, N=5694 is a valid number.

Is there a higher N with the same k=3, but with higher digits?

Wait, N=5694 is the maximum for k=3.

Wait, but let's see, can we have a higher N with k=3 but with higher digits in other positions?

Wait, A=5 is fixed, but if I can have B=7, which is higher than6, but would that be possible?

Wait, for k=3, B=6 or13 invalid.

So, B=6 is maximum.

So, N=5694 is the maximum for k=3.

So, perhaps N=5694 is the maximum possible.

But wait, let me think if changing digits in other ways might give a higher N.

Wait, N=5694.

Is there a higher four-digit number with this property?

Let me think of N=5794.

Wait, let's test.

N=5794.

Compute M1=1794. 1794 ÷7: 7*256=1792, remainder2. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Alternatively, N=5784.

M1=1784. 1784 ÷7: 7*254=1778, remainder6. Not good.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=5774.

M1=1774. 1774 ÷7: 7*253=1771, remainder3. Not good.

Nope.

Alternatively, N=5764.

M1=1764. 1764 ÷7=252. Exactly. So, M1 is good.

Now, check M2: replace B with1: 5164.

5164 ÷7: 7*737=5159, remainder5. Not good.

So, N=5764 invalid.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps N=5694 is indeed the maximum.

Wait, let's try N=5994.

M1=1994. 1994 ÷7=284.857... Not integer.

No.

Alternatively, N=5894.

M1=1894. 1894 ÷7=270.571... Not integer.

No.

Hmm, this is getting tedious.

Alternatively, perhaps N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, earlier I found N=5694, which is valid.

But let me check N=6694.

Wait, N=6694.

M1=1694. 1694 ÷7=242. Exactly.

M2=6194. 6194 ÷7=884.857... Not integer.

So, invalid.

So, N=6694 invalid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=6684.

M1=1684. 1684 ÷7=240.571... Not integer.

No.

Wait, perhaps I need to conclude that N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, wait a second.

Wait, earlier, for k=3, I had A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, giving N=5694.

But let me check another possibility for k=3: A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4. That's the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps D can be higher, but D=4 is maximum for k=3.

Wait, D=4 or11 invalid.

So, no.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let me check N=5694.

Wait, 5694 is a four-digit number.

Q is the quotient when divided by1000, so Q=5.

R is the remainder, which is 694.

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let me confirm.

Wait, N=5694.

N divided by1000 is 5 with remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

But wait, earlier when I thought N=5694 is the maximum, but I think I might have missed a higher N.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, for k=3, N=5694.

But what about N=7777.

Wait, we saw earlier that N=7777 doesn't satisfy the condition, as M1=1777 is not divisible by7.

Similarly, N=7744 didn't work.

Wait, perhaps N=7721.

M1=1721 ÷7=245.857... Not integer.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7700.

M1=1700 ÷7=242.857... Not integer.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7694.

M1=1694, which is divisible by7.

Then, M2=7194 ÷7=1027.714... Not integer.

So, invalid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7684.

M1=1684 ÷7=240.571... Not integer.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7674.

M1=1674 ÷7=239.142... Not integer.

No.

Wait, perhaps N=7664.

M1=1664 ÷7=237.714... Not integer.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7654.

M1=1654 ÷7=236.285... Not integer.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7644.

M1=1644 ÷7=234.857... Not integer.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7634.

M1=1634 ÷7=233.428... Not integer.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7624.

M1=1624 ÷7=232. Exactly.

So, M1=1624 is good.

Now, check M2: Replace B with1: 7124.

7124 ÷7=1017.714... Not integer.

So, invalid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, N=7614.

M1=1614 ÷7=230.571... Not integer.

No.

Hmm.

So, seems like N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let me think about another approach.

Since N=5694 is valid, but maybe there's a higher N with a different k.

Wait, for k=3, N=5694.

What about k=3 and A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

Is there a way to make A higher? As we saw earlier, A=5 is fixed for k=3.

Wait, unless we can have a higher A with a different k.

Wait, for example, for k=2, A=6.

But as we saw earlier, N=6943 didn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, perhaps N=6943.

Check M1=1943.

1943 ÷7=277.571... Not integer.

So, invalid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, for k=3, could we have a higher N?

Wait, no.

So, I think N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but wait, another thought: perhaps N=7777 doesn't work, but what about N=7744?

We saw M1=1744 not divisible.

Wait, what about N=7744 as a test.

M1=1744 ÷7=249.142... Not integer.

No.

Alternatively, N=7721.

M1=1721 ÷7=245.857... Not integer.

No.

Hmm.

Perhaps N=5694 is indeed the maximum.

So, then Q=5, R=694.

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought there might be a higher N.

Wait, let me check N=5694.

Yes, it satisfies all four conditions.

So, I think that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let \( N \) be represented as \( ABCD \), where \( A, B, C, D \) are its digits.

### Key Steps:

1. **Conditions for Divisibility**:
   - Changing any digit of \( N \) to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. This gives four conditions:
     - \( 1BCD \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( A1CD \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( AB1D \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( ABC1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

2. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Express each condition in terms of \( N \) and its digits:
     - \( N - (A - 1) \times 1000 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( N - (B - 1) \times 100 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( N - (C - 1) \times 10 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( N - (D - 1) \times 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - Simplify using modulo 7:
     - \( 1000 \equiv 6 \mod 7 \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \), \( 10 \equiv 3 \mod 7 \), \( 1 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
     - Thus, \( 6(A - 1) \equiv 2(B - 1) \equiv 3(C - 1) \equiv D - 1 \mod 7 \)

3. **Solving for Digits**:
   - Let \( k \) be the common value modulo 7. Express each digit in terms of \( k \):
     - \( A \equiv 1 + 6k \mod 7 \)
     - \( B \equiv 1 + 4k \mod 7 \)
     - \( C \equiv 1 + 5k \mod 7 \)
     - \( D \equiv 1 + k \mod 7 \)
   - Ensure each digit is valid (0-9) and maximize \( N \).

4. **Testing Values of \( k \)**:
   - For \( k = 3 \):
     - \( A = 5 \), \( B = 6 \), \( C = 9 \), \( D = 4 \)
     - \( N = 5694 \)
     - Verify all conditions:
       - \( 1624 \div 7 = 232 \) (exact)
       - \( 5124 \div 7 = 732 \) (exact)
       - \( 5614 \div 7 = 802 \) (exact)
       - \( 5621 \div 7 = 803 \) (exact)

5. **Conclusion**:
   - \( N = 5694 \) is the largest valid number.
   - Divide \( N \) by 1000: \( Q = 5 \), \( R = 694 \)
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \)

**Final Answer**: \(\boxed{699}\)
