Alright, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). The question is about finding the distance from a special point inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point, I, is called the incenter, I think, because it's equidistant from all the faces. The distance is to be expressed in the form m sqrt(n)/p, and then I have to find m + n + p.

Okay, so first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (which is this distance) can be found using the formula similar to the inradius of a triangle but adapted for 3D. For a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In 3D, it's the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the faces, all multiplied by something, right?

Wait, let me recall the exact formula. For a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume V divided by the total surface area S. So, r = 3V / S. That sounds right because in a triangle, it's area divided by semiperimeter, but in 3D, volume is like the 3D area, and the surface area is analogous to the perimeter in 2D. So, I think that's the formula.

So, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Then, compute r as 3V/S.

But to find the volume, I need coordinates or some way to compute it. Since all the edges are given in pairs, maybe this tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here. But the edges are given in reciprocal pairs, which might imply some symmetry.

Wait, AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So, this is a kind of edge-symmetric tetrahedron. Hmmm, maybe it's a disphenoid? I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which is exactly the case here. So, it's a disphenoid. That's useful because I know that in a disphenoid, certain properties hold, like the volume can be calculated using the formula sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) ) / 72, or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing with another formula.

Alternatively, the volume can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I think that's a reliable method when all edges are known. The formula for the volume V is sqrt( determinant / 288 ), where determinant is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.

Let me recall how the Cayley-Menger determinant works. For a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f, the determinant is:

| 0  1    1    1    1  |
| 1  0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²  0   d²  e² |
| 1  b² d²  0   f² |
| 1  c² e²  f²  0  |

And the determinant of this 5x5 matrix is called the Cayley-Menger determinant, and then V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). So, I can compute that.

Given that, let's note down the edges. From the problem, AB = sqrt(41), CD = sqrt(41). AC = sqrt(80), BD = sqrt(80). BC = sqrt(89
