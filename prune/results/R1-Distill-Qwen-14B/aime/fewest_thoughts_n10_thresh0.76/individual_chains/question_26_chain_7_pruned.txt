Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to picture it step by step. There's triangle ABC inscribed in a circle, which means it's a cyclic triangle, and the circle is its circumcircle. The tangents to this circle at points B and C meet at a point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle again at point P. I need to find the length of AP.

Given sides are AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. So, triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, and 10. Hmm, that's a scalene triangle. Let me see if it's a right-angled triangle or something else. Wait, 5^2 + 9^2 is 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10^2 = 100. So, not a right-angled triangle. Maybe acute or obtuse.

The problem involves tangents from a point to a circle and intersection points. Tangents from a common external point to a circle have equal lengths. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, BD equals CD. That might come in handy.

I think I should start by finding some key properties of triangle ABC. Maybe the circumradius? Because the tangents from D to B and C will relate to the circumradius. Wait, tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is called the ex-pole or something? Not sure, but maybe I can use properties of the power of a point.

Power of point D with respect to Ï‰ is equal to DB^2, since DB is the tangent length. Similarly, DC^2 is the same, so DB = DC. So, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. Wait, but BC is a side of the triangle, so the perpendicular bisector of BC is the median from A if the triangle is equilateral, but it's not. So, D is somewhere outside the triangle, on the perpendicular bisector of BC.

Hmm, maybe using coordinate geometry could help here. Let me try setting up coordinates. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, point A is at (10, 0) because AC is 10 units. Point B has coordinates (x, y). The distances AB = 5 and BC = 9.

So, from point B to point C (0,0) is 9, so:

x^2 + y^2 = 81.

From point B to point A (10,0) is 5, so:

(x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x - 10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 25 - 81

Expanding (x - 10)^2: x^2 - 20x + 100 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = -56

Simplify: -20x + 100 = -56

So, -20x = -156 => x = 156 / 20 = 39 / 5 = 7.8.

Then, from x^2 + y^2 = 81:

(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81.

Calculating (39/5)^2: (39)^2 = 1521, so 1521/25. 81 is 2025/25.

So, y^2 = 2025/25 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25.

Thus, y = sqrt(504/25) = sqrt(504)/5. Simplify sqrt(504): sqrt(16*31.5) = wait, 504 divided by 1
