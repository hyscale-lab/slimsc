Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The problem is about counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I know that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. That's a classic combinatorial problem where the number of paths is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But this problem is a bit more specific because it's about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, I need to think about what that means.

When the problem says the path "changes direction exactly four times," I suppose that refers to the number of times the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. For example, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, that's two direction changes. Wait, no, actually, each switch counts as a change. So, in that example, right to up is one change, then up to right is another, right to up is another, and up to right is another. So that's four direction changes, right? So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments in the path.

Wait, no, let me think again. If you have a path that is a series of horizontal and vertical moves, each time you switch from horizontal to vertical or vice versa, that's a direction change. So, if the path has k direction changes, it's divided into k+1 segments. So, for four direction changes, the path would have five segments. Hmm, that makes sense.

So, for each path, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times you switch between moving right and up. So, the problem is asking for paths with exactly four such switches. Therefore, the path is made up of five segments, alternating between right and up moves.

Now, let's model this. Each path has eight right moves and eight up moves, but arranged in segments. Since the path alternates direction each time, the number of right segments and up segments can differ by at most one. Since there are five segments, and the path starts either with a right or an up move, depending on the grid.

Wait, the grid is from the lower left to the upper right, so I think the first move is to the right. Because the lower left is (0,0) and the upper right is (8,8), so moving right increases the x-coordinate, moving up increases the y-coordinate. So, if you start at (0,0), moving right would take you towards (8,0), and moving up towards (0,8). So, you can start with either, but in terms of the grid, perhaps the direction isn't fixed. Hmm, but the problem statement doesn't specify whether the path has to start with a right or up move. So, maybe it can start with either.

But in any case, the number of direction changes is four, so the number of segments is five. So, the path is divided into five parts
