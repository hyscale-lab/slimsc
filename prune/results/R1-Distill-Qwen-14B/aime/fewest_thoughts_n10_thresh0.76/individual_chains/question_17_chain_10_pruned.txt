Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, let me think. So, the boxes are all rectangular, which means their dimensions are length, width, and height, say x, y, z. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius would be half of that diagonal.

So, the space diagonal of a rectangular box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, to find r², I need to find x² + y² + z² and then divide by 4. But how do I find x² + y² + z² given the surface area and volume?

I know that the surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. And the volume is xyz = 23.

So, let me write down the knowns:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 → xy + yz + zx = 27.
2. xyz = 23.

I need to find x² + y² + z². I remember that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So, if I can find x + y + z, I can find x² + y² + z².

But wait, I don't know x + y + z. Is there another way? Alternatively, maybe I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given quantities.

Let me see. Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx = 27, and Q = xyz = 23.

I know that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P. So, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54.

But I don't know S yet. So, how can I find S? Hmm, maybe I can use optimization techniques.

Wait, we need the minimal sphere that can contain any box in set B. So, for all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, find the minimal sphere that can contain each of them. Therefore, we need the maximum value of x² + y² + z² over all such boxes, because r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4, so to minimize r, we need the minimal maximum x² + y² + z².

Wait, no. The sphere needs to contain each box. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain any box from B. So, the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the radius needed for the box with the maximum
