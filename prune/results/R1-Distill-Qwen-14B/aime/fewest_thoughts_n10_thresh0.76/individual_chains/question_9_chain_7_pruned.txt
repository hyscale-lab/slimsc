Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product of two real numbers x and y, both greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I know some logarithm properties, so maybe I can simplify these equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x). Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a), I can bring the exponent x in front. So that becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}). Applying the same power rule, that would be 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now, I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I notice that both equations have logarithms with swapped bases and arguments. Maybe I can express log_x(y) in terms of log_y(x) or vice versa. Let me recall the change of base formula: log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). That could be useful.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A. Let's substitute these into the equations.

So, equation 1 becomes: x * A = 10. That gives me x = 10 / A.

Equation 2 becomes: 4y * (1/A) = 10. So, (4y)/A = 10. Let me simplify that: 4y = 10A, so y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2.

Now I have expressions for both x and y in terms of A. Let me write them down again:

x = 10 / A

y = (5A)/2

But I also know that A is log_x(y). So, A = log_x(y). Let's substitute the expressions for x and y into this.

So, A = log_x(y) = log_{10/A}( (5A)/2 )

Hmm, that might be a bit complicated, but let's try to express it using the change of base formula again. Remember that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). So, A = ln( (5A)/2 ) / ln(10/A )

Let me write that out:

A = [ ln( (5A)/2 ) ] / [ ln(10/A) ]

That looks a bit messy, but maybe if I let u = A, I can rewrite this equation in terms of u and solve for it.

So, let me set u = A. Then, the equation becomes:

u = [ ln( (5u)/2 ) ] / [ ln(10/u) ]

Wait, that's a transcendental equation. I might not be able to solve it algebraically; perhaps I can manipulate it further or find a substitution.

Let me denote t = u. Then, the equation is:

t = [ ln( (5t)/2 ) ] / [ ln(10/t) ]

Hmm, maybe cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominator:

t * ln(10/t) = ln( (5t)/2 )

Let me express 10/t as 10 * (1/t), so ln(10/t) = ln(10) - ln(t). Then, the left side becomes t*(ln(10) - ln(t)).

So, expanding that:

t * ln(10) - t * ln(t) = ln( (5t)/2 )

Now, let's look at the right side: ln(5t/2) can be written as ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2), because ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b), and ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b). So, ln(5t/2) = ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2).

Putting it all together, the equation becomes:

t * ln(10) - t * ln(t) = ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2)

Let me bring all terms to one side:

t * ln(10) - t * ln(t) - ln(5) - ln(t) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can factor some terms.

Looking at the terms, I have terms with ln(t) and constants. Let's group the terms with ln(t):

[ -t * ln(t) - ln(t) ] + [ t * ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2) ] = 0

Factor out -ln(t) from the first group:

- ln(t) (t + 1) + t * ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

So,

- (t + 1) ln(t) + t ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

(t + 1) ln(t) = t ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Let me compute the constants on the right side. ln(10) is about 2.302585, but maybe I can keep it symbolic for now.

Wait, ln(5) and ln(2) can be combined. ln(5) - ln(2) is ln(5/2). But here it's -ln(5) + ln(2) = - (ln(5) - ln(2)) = - ln(5/2).

Wait, no, that would be incorrect. Let me compute:

-ln(5) + ln(2) = ln(2) - ln(5) = ln(2/5). Because ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b).

So, the right side becomes t * ln(10) + ln(2/
