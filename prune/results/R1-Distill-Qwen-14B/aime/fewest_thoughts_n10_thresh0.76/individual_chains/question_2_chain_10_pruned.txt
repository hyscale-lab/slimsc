Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, I think, since they're all in the first quadrant. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, each segment PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1.

The problem states there's a unique point C on AB (the line segment connecting A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, we need to find such a point C on AB. Then, we're supposed to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Finally, express OC² as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.

First, let me visualize the setup. Points O, A, and B form a right triangle? Wait, O is at the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. So, OA is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (1/2, 0), and OB is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then AB connects (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me calculate the length of AB to see if it's a unit length or something else.

The distance between A and B can be found using the distance formula: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is a unit length. Interesting. So AB is a segment in F because it's length 1, P is on x-axis (A), and Q is on y-axis (B). So AB itself is a member of the family F.

Now, the family F consists of all such segments of length 1 from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, each PQ in F is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p and q positive real numbers such that the distance sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Each such segment can be parameterized. Since p and q are positive, we can let p = cos(theta) and q = sin(theta), where theta is an angle from 0 to pi/2. So, each segment PQ is from (cos(theta), 0) to (0, sin(theta)).

Now, the point C is on AB, but it's not on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, for all other segments PQ in F, except AB, the point C is not on PQ. So, C is only on AB and no other PQ from F.

We need to find C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ in F. Then, compute OC².

So, perhaps the key is that C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. That is, the family F forms some envelope, and AB is a tangent to it at point C. So, C is the point of contact, and hence, it's only on AB and no other PQ from F.

Alternatively, since all segments PQ in F are lines of length 1 from the x-axis to y-axis, perhaps the family F forms the boundary of some region, and AB is a tangent to that boundary at C.

Wait, but I think in the problem statement, they're saying that C is on AB and not on any other PQ from F. So, C is on AB, and for every other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. Thus, C is only on AB and no other PQ.

So, I should find the point C on AB such that for no other PQ in F does C lie on PQ.

Alternatively, in other words, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

To approach this, perhaps parameterize AB and then see for each point on AB, whether it lies on any other PQ in F.

Alternatively, perhaps for a point C on AB, it lies on another PQ from F only if certain conditions are satisfied. So, we can express the condition when point C lies on PQ for some other PQ, and then find the point where this is impossible except for PQ = AB.

So, let's parameterize AB.

Points on AB can be expressed parametrically. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, a parametric equation for AB can be written as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2) * t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) * t

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So, when t=0, we are at A (1/2, 0), and t=1, we are at B (0, sqrt(3)/2).

So, point C can be represented as (1/2 - (1/2) t, (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t
