Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3 = 81) and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. The task is to find the least integer b (b >= 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Alright, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.

Let me break down the problem.

First, n is a two-digit number in base b. That means in base 10, n can be expressed as a * b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b. So, a is the first digit, c is the second digit. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1, and both a and c must be less than b (since in base b, digits go from 0 to b-1). So, a is in 1 to b-1, and c is in 0 to b-1.

Second, the sum of the digits a + c must equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, we have:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But n is also equal to a*b + c. So, substituting, we have:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange the equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of a and c. Maybe I can rearrange it differently.

Alternatively, I can write the equation as:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Which implies:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

Then:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Since b has to be an integer, [(a + c)^2 - c] must be divisible by a.

Let me note that. So for each base b, and each pair of digits (a, c), we can compute n = a*b + c, and check if a + c = sqrt(n). But perhaps it's more efficient to think in terms of a and c, and then find the possible b for each pair (a, c).

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimal b where there are more than ten such n's. So, for each base b, I need to count the number of (a, c) pairs that satisfy the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Which can be rewritten as:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a

Since b must be an integer, this fraction must result in an integer.

So, for given a and c, we can compute b as above. But a and c must satisfy the digit constraints in base b: a must be from 1 to b-1, and c must be from 0 to b-1.

So perhaps I can approach this by iterating over possible a and c, compute the corresponding b, and then for each b, count how many (a, c) pairs lead to it. Then, I need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to fix a base b, and then for each possible
