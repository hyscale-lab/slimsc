Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when N is divided by 1000, we get a quotient Q and a remainder R. We need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So, first, I need to find this number N. It's a four-digit number, and it's the greatest such number with a specific property. The property is that changing any one of its digits to 1 makes the number divisible by 7.

Let me break this down. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. We need the largest such N where if I change any single digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which must be divisible by 7. The same goes for changing C or D to 1.

My goal is to find the largest such N. Then, once I have N, I need to compute Q and R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000, and R is the remainder. That would mean Q is the thousands digit, and R is the last three digits, right? But wait, no, 1000 is 10^3, so N divided by 1000 would give Q as the thousands digit, and R as the last three digits. So Q is the thousands digit, and R is the last three digits. Then, Q + R is the sum of the thousands digit and the last three digits.

But before that, I need to find N.

Let me think about the structure of N. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = WXYZ, where W, X, Y, Z are digits from 0 to 9, and W is at least 1 because it's a four-digit number.

Now, the key property is that if I replace any one digit with 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 should make the number divisible by 7.

So, let's write down what this implies.

1. Replacing W with 1: 1XYZ must be divisible by 7.
2. Replacing X with 1: W1YZ must be divisible by 7.
3. Replacing Y with 1: WX1Z must be divisible by 7.
4. Replacing Z with 1: WXY1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

We need to find the largest such N, so ideally, N is as large as possible, so we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find such a number.

But that might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the properties.

Each of these modified numbers is congruent to 0 mod 7. So, for each digit position, when we change it to 1, the number becomes 0 mod 7.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z. When we change a digit, say, the thousands digit W to 1, we get 1000*1 + 100X + 10Y + Z. Let me call this number N1.

Similarly, changing X to 1 gives N2 = 1000W + 100*1 + 10Y + Z, and so on.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, mathematically:

1. N1 = 1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N2 = 1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N3 = 1000W + 100X + 10 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N4 = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, we can write these congruences:

1. 1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000W + 100X + 10 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

We can also note that 1000 ≡ 1000 mod 7. Let's compute 1000 mod 7.

7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, and 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite each congruence:

1. N1: 6 + 2X + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N2: 6W + 2 + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N3: 6W + 2X + 1 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N4: 6W + 2X + 3Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, now we have four congruence equations:

1. 6 + 2X + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7  --> Equation (1)
2. 6W + 2 + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7 --> Equation (2)
3. 6W + 2X + 1 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7 --> Equation (3)
4. 6W + 2X + 3Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 --> Equation (4)

We can try to express these equations in terms of each other to find relationships between W, X, Y, Z.

Let me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (1):

(6W + 2X + 3Y + 1) - (6 + 2X + 3Y + Z) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

6W + 2X + 3Y + 1 - 6 - 2X - 3Y - Z ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify terms:

6W - 6 + 1 - Z ≡ 0 mod 7

Which is:

6(W - 1) - Z + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, that's 6(W - 1) - (Z - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Wait, 6(W - 1) - (Z - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Alternatively, 6(W - 1) ≡ Z - 1 mod 7.

So, 6(W - 1) ≡ Z - 1 mod 7.

I can write this as:

Z ≡ 6(W - 1) + 1 mod 7.

Simplify:

Z ≡ 6W - 6 + 1 mod 7
Z ≡ 6W - 5 mod 7
Z ≡ 6W + 2 mod 7 (since -5 mod 7 is 2)

So, Z ≡ 6W + 2 mod 7. Let's note this as Equation (5).

Similarly, let me subtract Equation (2) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (2):

(6W + 2X + 3Y + 1) - (6W + 2 + 3Y + Z) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

6W + 2X + 3Y +1 -6W -2 -3Y - Z ≡0 mod7

Simplify:

2X -1 - Z ≡0 mod7

So, 2X - Z ≡ 1 mod7.

Let me rearrange:

2X ≡ Z + 1 mod7.

We can write this as:

Z ≡ 2X -1 mod7. Let's call this Equation (6).

From Equation (5) and Equation (6), we can set them equal:

6W + 2 ≡ 2X - 1 mod7.

So,

6W + 2 ≡ 2X -1 mod7.

Bring all terms to left:

6W - 2X + 3 ≡0 mod7.

Let me write this as:

6W - 2X ≡ -3 mod7.

Which is the same as:

6W - 2X ≡ 4 mod7 (since -3 mod7 is 4).

We can factor 2:

2*(3W - X) ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, multiplicative inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7).

So, multiply both sides by 4:

(2*(3W - X))*4 ≡4*4 mod7
(8*(3W - X)) ≡16 mod7

But 8≡1 mod7, so:

(3W - X) ≡16 mod7

16 mod7 is 2, so:

3W - X ≡2 mod7.

This gives us X ≡3W -2 mod7. Equation (7).

So now, from Equation (7), X is determined modulo7 based on W.

Similarly, from Equation (6), Z is determined modulo7 based on X.

So, let's also try to get another equation.

Let me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (1):

(6W + 2X +1 + Z) - (6 + 2X +3Y + Z) ≡0 mod7

Simplify:

6W +2X +1 + Z -6 -2X -3Y -Z ≡0 mod7

Simplify:

6W -5 -3Y ≡0 mod7

So,

6W -3Y ≡5 mod7.

We can factor 3:

3*(2W - Y) ≡5 mod7.

Again, 3 and 7 are coprime, so multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. The inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, multiply both sides by 5:
