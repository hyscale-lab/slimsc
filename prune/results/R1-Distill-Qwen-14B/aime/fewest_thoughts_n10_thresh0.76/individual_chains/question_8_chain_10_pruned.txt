Okay, so I have this problem that asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and their products, sometimes symmetric expressions can be simplified using techniques like factoring or by considering symmetric functions. Let me see what I can do here.

The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. That's a linear equation, so that should be manageable. The second equation is a bit more complicated: it's a sum of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Let me write that out:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Looking at this, I notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are different variables. So, this can be factored a bit. Let me factor out common terms:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that's better. Let's see, since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), and similarly for the others. Let me try that.

So, substituting, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Expanding each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Combine like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now I have this expression in terms of a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can find a way to relate these to the sum a + b + c, which is 300.

I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, I can write:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 300² - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Similarly, I wonder if there's a formula for a³ + b³ + c³. Oh yeah, there's an identity: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, let me write that down:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Calculating 300³, which is 27,000,000. So:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Now, let me plug this back into the earlier equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expressions I found:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step. First, 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2(ab + ac + bc)) = -600(ab + ac + bc).

So, that part becomes 27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc).

Now, subtract the entire expression [27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc]:

So, the equation becomes:

[27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc)] - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let's distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) -27,000,000 + 900(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify terms:

27,000,000 -27,000,000 cancels out.

(-600(ab + ac + bc) + 900(ab + ac + bc)) = 300(ab + ac + bc).

And we have -3abc.

So, putting it all together:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out 3:

3[100(ab + ac + bc) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

So, now I have:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Now, this seems a bit more manageable. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + ac + bc.

Wait, actually, in standard symmetric sums, S1 = a + b + c, S2 = ab + ac + bc, S3 = abc. So, in this case, S1 = 300, S2 = Q, and S3 = P.

So, substituting that, the equation becomes:

100*S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So, 100*S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

I also know that S1 = 300. So, perhaps I can express S2 and S3 in terms of each other or find a relation.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me see if I can find another equation involving S2 and S3. 

Wait, actually, maybe I can consider the polynomial whose roots are a, b, c. That is, the monic cubic polynomial would be x³ - S1 x² + S2 x - S3 = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps using inequalities or bounds on S2 and S3?

Alternatively, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers and their sum is 300, maybe I can find possible values for S2 and S3 that satisfy 100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

Let me rearrange the equation:

S3 = 100*S2 - 2,000,000.

So, S3 must be equal to 100S2 - 2,000,000.

Now, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, S2 and S3 must be nonnegative as well. So, 100S2 - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 → S2 ≥ 20,000.

So, S2 must be at least 20,000.

Also, what's the maximum possible value of S2?

Well, for three nonnegative integers a, b, c with a + b + c = 300, the maximum of S2 occurs when two variables are as large as possible and the third is zero. For example, a = 300, b = 0, c = 0 → S2 = 0. But that's the case when one variable is 300 and the others are 0. Wait, no, wait, in that case, S2 is 0.

Wait, no, actually, wait. Let's think again. The maximum of ab + ac + bc occurs when two variables are as large as possible and the third is as small as possible, but not necessarily zero. Let's see.

Suppose c = 0, then a + b = 300, and S2 becomes ab + 0 + 0 = ab. The maximum of ab with a + b = 300 occurs when a = b = 150, so ab =
