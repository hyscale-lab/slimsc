Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. The hexagon is equilateral, which means all its sides are equal in length. Also, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's interesting because it probably means the hexagon has some symmetry or maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all internal angles equal.

The problem also mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300 units long. My goal is to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel. Since it's equilateral, each side has length 's' which I need to find.

When you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. So, these extensions must meet each other to form the triangle. Let's denote the triangle as triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. But which sides correspond to which lengths? I'm not sure yet.

Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by translating each side such that they meet the next side at a certain angle. But because it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

I remember that for such hexagons, there's a relationship between the side lengths and the distances between the opposite sides. Since all sides are equal, maybe the triangle formed by the extensions relates to the side length through some proportional relationships.

Wait, I think this might involve similar triangles or some proportionality. Let me think. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a larger triangle. The hexagon is inside this triangle, and each side of the hexagon is a portion of the sides of this larger triangle.

Let me try to model this. Suppose the triangle T has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. Let's assume, without loss of generality, that the sides 200, 240, and 300 correspond to the extensions of AB, CD, and EF respectively. But I'm not sure; maybe it's the other way around. I might need to figure that out.

Alternatively, perhaps each side of the triangle corresponds to two sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon has six sides, each pair of opposite sides contributes to one side of the triangle.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles here. If each side of the hexagon is parallel to its opposite side, then the extensions of AB and DE (which are parallel) will meet at some point, say point P. Similarly, extending BC and EF (parallel) meet at point Q, and extending CD and FA (parallel) meet at point R. Thus, triangle PQR is the triangle formed with sides 200, 240, 300.

But in this case, the hexagon is between these three sides. So, the sides of the hexagon are parts of the lines that form the triangle. So, maybe the side length of the hexagon is related to the segments cut off by the hexagon from the sides of triangle PQR.

I'm trying to recall if there's a formula that relates the side length of such a hexagon to the sides of the triangle formed by extending its sides. Maybe it's similar to the formula for a regular hexagon inscribed in a triangle, but this isn't regular, just equilateral with opposite sides parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the hexagon as being made up of three parallelograms? Since opposite sides are parallel and equal, each pair of opposite sides forms a parallelogram. But wait, the hexagon is convex, so maybe each pair of opposite sides are both equal and parallel, making the hexagon a centrally symmetric figure.

Wait, actually, a convex hexagon with opposite sides equal and parallel is called a "zonogon." In a zonogon, the sides are in pairs of equal length and opposite sides
