Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The problem says:

Let A, B, C, and D be points on the hyperbola (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me try to visualize this. We have a hyperbola, and there's a rhombus inscribed in it with its diagonals intersecting at the origin. The rhombus has vertices A, B, C, D on the hyperbola.

Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no—actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me recall: A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular.

So, in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I consider points A and C as the endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D as the endpoints of the other diagonal, then the coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So, if I have points A and C on the hyperbola, and B and D on the hyperbola, such that AC and BD are the diagonals intersecting at the origin, and AC is perpendicular to BD.

So, perhaps I can parametrize the points A, B, C, D in terms of some parameters.

Let me think. Let me assign coordinates to these points. Let me denote the coordinates of A as (x, y). Since the origin is the midpoint, point C would then be (-x, -y). Similarly, suppose point B is (u, v), so point D would be (-u, -v).

But since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps I can use the property that the product of their slopes is -1.

Wait, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider the parametrization of the hyperbola.

The hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, the standard parametrization for hyperbola is x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, where a² = 20 and b² = 24. So, a = sqrt(20), which is 2*sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6).

So, points on the hyperbola can be represented as (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ). Similarly, another parametrization can be done with a different angle, but in this case, maybe we can consider two angles θ and φ for points A and B.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of vectors because the diagonals intersect at the origin. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, which is the midpoint. So, the coordinates of A and C are negatives, as I thought earlier, same with B and D.

So, if I take point A as (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B is (u, v), so D is (-u, -v).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same length. Wait, no, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.

Wait, vector AC is from A to C, which is (-x -x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Vector BD is from B to D, which is (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero.

Wait, but actually, the diagonals are AC and BD, so the vectors AC and BD are from the origin to C and D, but since A is (x,y) and C is (-x,-y), the vector AC is C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is D - B = (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v).

Wait, but in reality, the diagonals are AC and BD, so the vectors along the diagonals are AC and BD. So, for the diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.

So, vector AC is ( -2x, -2y ), vector BD is ( -2u, -2v ). Their dot product is:

(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 4xu + 4yv = 4(xu + yv) = 0.

So, xu + yv = 0.

So, that's one equation.

Now, since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the hyperbola equation:

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 for A, same for B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

So, we have:

(1) x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

(2) u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

(3) xu + yv = 0

Now, ABCD is a rhombus, so all sides are equal. Let's compute the distance AB and BC.

Point A is (x,y), point B is (u, v). So, AB distance squared is (x - u)² + (y - v)².

Similarly, BC distance squared is (u + x)² + (v + y)², since point C is (-x, -y).

Wait, no: point B is (u,v), point C is (-x,-y). So, vector BC is from B to C: (-x - u, -y - v). So, BC squared is ( (-x - u)² + (-y - v)² ) = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2.

Similarly, AB is from A to B: (u - x, v - y). AB squared is (u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2.

Since it's a rhombus,
