Okay, let me try to figure out this math problem step by step. So, we have a list of positive integers with three properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9, which means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Our goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to recall what each term means. The mode is the number that appears most often. Since it's a unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the median is a positive integer not in the list, that's interesting. So the median is a number that isn't present in the list but is in between the middle two numbers if the list has an even length, or exactly the middle number if the list is odd-lengthâ€”but wait, no, the median itself isn't in the list. That's a bit confusing.

Wait, actually, even for an odd-length list, the median is the middle number. But if it's a positive integer not in the list itself, that can't be the case for an odd-length list because the middle number would be part of the list. So maybe the list has an even number of elements. Because for an even-length list, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So if that average is an integer not present in the list, that makes sense.

So, let's consider that the list has an even number of elements, say 2k elements. Then the median would be the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th numbers. Since the median is an integer, the sum of these two middle numbers must be even. So their average is an integer, but neither of those two numbers is equal to that median.

Wait, let me think again. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So if the median is, say, m, then m is not in the list, but (k-th + (k+1)-th)/2 = m. So the two middle numbers must add up to 2m. But since m isn't in the list, neither of these two middle numbers is m. So for example, maybe the two middle numbers are m-1 and m+1, so their average is m, but m isn't in the list.

Alright, so the list is even-length, and the median is an integer not in the list. Got it.

Next, the sum of the numbers is 30. So the average is 30 divided by the number of elements. Hmm, but without knowing the number of elements, this might be tricky.

The mode is 9, unique. So 9 must appear at least twice, but more than any other number. So other numbers can appear at most once, unless 9 appears more than twice. Let's see.

So I should probably figure out the possible lengths of the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements in the list. Since it's a list of positive integers, the minimum possible n is
