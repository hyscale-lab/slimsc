Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits so that two conditions are met. The first condition is that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. The second condition is that the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. 

Hmm, let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, which means two rows and three columns. Let me denote the cells as follows:

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array}\]

So, the first number formed by reading left to right in the top row is the 3-digit number abc, which is 100a + 10b + c. The second number is def, which is 100d + 10e + f. The sum of these two numbers should be 999.

Similarly, reading top to bottom, each column forms a 2-digit number: ad, be, and cf. So, the sum of these three two-digit numbers is 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f, which should equal 99.

So, putting this together, we have two equations:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Let me rewrite these equations for clarity.

Equation 1:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Equation 2:
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
Which simplifies to:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Wait, I notice that Equation 1 and Equation 2 seem related. Let me see if I can express one in terms of the other.

Looking at Equation 1, the terms are 100a, 10b, c, 100d, 10e, f. Equation 2 has 10a, d, 10b, e, 10c, f.

So, if I subtract Equation 2 multiplied by 10 from Equation 1, maybe something will cancel out.

Wait, let's see. Let me compute 10*(Equation 2):

10*(10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 100a + d + 100b + e + 100c + 10f

Equation 1 is 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f.

So, Equation 1 minus 10*(Equation 2) would be:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) 
- (100a + d + 100b + e + 100c + 10f)
= (0a) + (-90b) + (-99c) + (99d) + (9e) + (-9f) = 999 - 10*99

Compute 999 - 990 = 9.

So, the equation becomes:

-90b -99c +99d +9e -9f = 9

Let me factor out 9:

9*(-10b -11c +11d +e -f) =9

Divide both sides by 9:

-10b -11c +11d +e -f =1

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can express some variables in terms of others. Let me think about Equation 2.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f =99

Let me group terms:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) =99

Each of these is a two-digit number. So, the sum of three two-digit numbers is 99.

So, the sum of the three two-digit numbers is 99, which is a two-digit number ending with 9. That might give us some clues about the digits.

Wait, but 99 is less than 100, so each of the two-digit numbers is between 0 and 99, inclusive.

But actually, since each digit is 0-9, a two-digit number can be from 00 to 99. So, the sum of three two-digit numbers can be from 0 to 297. But in our case, it's 99.

Wait, but maybe this helps in figuring out the possible values.

Alternatively, let me consider Equation 1 and Equation 2.

Equation 1: 100a + 10
