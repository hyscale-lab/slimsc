Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember something about sets and Venn diagrams from my math class, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me see if I can apply that here.

First, let's list out the given data:

- Total residents: 900
- Number of people who own a diamond ring (let's call this D): 195
- Number of people who own a set of golf clubs (G): 367
- Number of people who own a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H). So, H is 900. But since it's mentioned separately, maybe it's another item to consider.

Wait, so each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Does that mean H is like a fourth item in addition to D, G, and S? So, we have four items: D, G, S, H. But the problem is asking about people who own all four. Hmm.

But wait, the problem says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things and 234 who own exactly three. Oh, so it's about the overlaps between D, G, S, and H. But since H is something everyone has, that might complicate things. Let me think.

Wait, but H is not an optional item; everyone has it. So, when considering ownership, H is always included. So, does that mean that any count we
