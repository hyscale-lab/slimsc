Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity and \(\omega \neq 1\). Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially in products and polynomials. Since \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \(\omega^{13} = 1\), and the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \(\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1\).

But wait, I'm dealing with a product over k from 0 to 12. That's all the 13th roots of unity, including \(\omega^0 = 1\). So maybe I can find a way to express this product in terms of cyclotomic polynomials or something similar.

Looking at the expression inside the product: \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Let me see if I can factor this or rewrite it in a more manageable form. Let me denote \(z = \omega^k\), so the term becomes \(2 - 2z + z^2\). That's a quadratic in z, right? So, \(z^2 - 2z + 2\).

Hmm, can I factor this quadratic? Let me try to compute its discriminant: \(D = (-2)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 2 = 4 - 8 = -4\). So the roots are complex: \(z = [2 \pm \sqrt{-4}]/2 = 1 \pm i\). So, the quadratic factors as \((z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\). Therefore, \(z^2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\).

So, substituting back, the term \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) becomes \((\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\).

So, the entire product becomes:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} [\omega^k - (1 + i)] [\omega^k - (1 - i)] = \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \right) \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \right)
\]

But wait, since we're dealing with the product over all 13th roots of unity, I think each of these products can be related to the value of a polynomial evaluated at specific points. Specifically, the product of \((x - \omega^k)\) for k=0 to 12 is the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\), because that's the minimal polynomial for the roots of unity. So, \(x^{13} - 1 = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k)\).

In this case, for the first product, if I set \(x = 1 + i\), then \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \omega^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1\). Similarly, for the second product, setting \(x = 1 - i\), we get \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \omega^k) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1\).

So, putting it all together, our original product is:
\[
[(1 + i)^{13} - 1] \times [(1 - i)^{13} - 1]
\]
Now, I need to compute this product. Let's compute each part separately.

First, compute \( (1 + i)^{13} \). I know that \(1 + i\) can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is \(\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}\), and the argument is \(\pi/4\) radians. So, \(1 + i = \sqrt{2} \cdot e^{i\pi/4}\).

Therefore, raising it to the 13th power:
\[
(1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \cdot e^{i \cdot 13 \cdot \pi/4}
\]
Compute \( (\sqrt{2})^{13} \). Since \( (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \), so \( (\sqrt{2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 \times \sqrt{2} = 64 \times \sqrt{2} \).

Now, the exponent in the exponential is \(13 \cdot \pi/4\). Let's simplify that:
\(13 \cdot \pi/4 = 3\pi + \pi/4\). Since \(3\pi\) is equivalent to \(\pi\) modulo \(2\pi\), because \(3\pi = \pi + 2\pi\), so we can subtract \(2\pi\) to get an angle within \(0\) to \(2\pi\).

Wait, no, more accurately, 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1. So, 13π/4 = 3π + π/4. But 3π is the same as π modulo 2π because 3π - 2π = π. So, 13π/4 is equivalent to π + π/4 = 5π/4. Therefore, the exponential term is \(e^{i5\pi/4}\), which is equal to \(-\sqrt{2}/2 - i\sqrt{2}/2\).

So, putting it all together:
\[
(1 + i)^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} \times \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right ) = 64 \sqrt{2} \times \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + i) \right )
\]
Simplify that:
Multiply the constants: \(64 \sqrt{2} \times (-\sqrt{2}/2) = 64 \times (- (2)/2 ) = 64 \times (-1) = -64\).

So, \( (1 + i)^{13} = -64 (1 + i) \).

Similarly, compute \( (1 - i)^{13} \). 

Again, \(1 - i\) has modulus \(\sqrt{2}\) and argument \(-\pi/4\). So, \(1 - i = \sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/4}\).

Raising to the 13th power:
\[
(1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \cdot e^{-i \cdot 13 \pi/4}
\]
The modulus part is the same: \(64 \sqrt{2}\).

The exponent: \( -13\pi/4 \). Let's add multiples of \(2\pi\) to find an equivalent angle between 0 and \(2\pi\). 

-13π/4 + 4π = (-13π + 16π)/4 = 3π/4. So, \(e^{-13\pi i /4} = e^{i3\pi/4}\).

\(e^{i3\pi/4} = -\sqrt{2}/2 + i\sqrt{2}/2\).

So, \( (1 - i)^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} \times (-\sqrt{2}/2 + i \sqrt{2}/2 ) = 64 \sqrt{2} \times ( -\sqrt{2}/2 (1 - i) ) \).

Simplify:
\(64 \sqrt{2} \times (-\sqrt{2}/2 ) = 64 \times (-2/2) = -64\).

Thus, \( (1 - i)^{13} = -64 (1 - i) \).

Now, plug these back into the original expression:

\[
[(1 + i)^{13} - 1] \times [(1 - i)^{13} - 1] = [ -64 (1 + i) - 1 ] \times [ -64 (1 - i) -1 ]
\]

Simplify each bracket:

First bracket: \(-64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i\).

Second bracket: \(-64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i\).

So, the product is:
\[
(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)
\]
This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.

Compute modulus squared:
\[
(-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 65^2 + 64^2
\]
Compute each term:

65^2: 65*65. Let's compute 60^2 + 2*60*5 +5^2 = 3600 + 600 +25 = 4225.

64^2: 4096.

So, the product is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, 4225 + 4096: 4225 + 4000 = 8225, plus 96 is 8321.

So, the entire product is 8321.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, the modulus squared is indeed (a)^2 + (b)^2 where a is -65 and b is -64i? Wait, no, actually, the modulus of a complex number \(a + bi\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\), so the modulus squared is \(a^2 + b^2\). So in this case, the first complex number is (-65, -64), so modulus squared is (-65)^2 + (-64)^2 = 65² +64² = 4225 + 4096 = 8321, which is correct.

So, the product is 8321. Now, we need the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.

To find 8321 mod 1000. That's the last three digits of 8321, which is 321.

Wait, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.

Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the computation earlier.

Let me retrace:

1. Expressed each term as quadratic in \(\omega^k\) and factorized into two linear terms.

2. Then, the product became the product over all \(\omega^k\) of each factor, which relates to evaluating a polynomial at \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\).

3. So, the product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1][(1 - i)^13 - 1].

4. Then, I calculated (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, each equal to -64(1 ± i).

5. Subtracted 1 from each, leading to (-65 ∓ 64i) and (-65 ±64i).

6. Then, multiplied them to get (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 +4096 = 8321.

7. Then, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

So, seems correct. But wait, let me make sure that the initial step where I split the product into two parts is valid.

Wait, the original product is over k=0 to 12, of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product of (ω^k - (1 +i))(ω^k - (1 -i)).

So, that's correct because \(z^2 -2z +2 = (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i))\).

Therefore, the product over k=0 to 12 is the product over k of (ω^k - (1 +i)) times the product over k of (ω^k - (1 -i)).

And since the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x^13 -1, so substituting x =1 +i gives (1 +i)^13 -1, and x=1 -i gives (1 -i)^13 -1.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, perhaps I didn't make a mistake, and the answer is 321. But wait, let me compute (1 +i)^13 again to be thorough.

Calculating (1 +i)^1, (1 +i)^2, ... up to 13th power.

Wait, 1 +i has magnitude √2, angle π/4. So, when raised to the 13th power, it's (√2)^13 * e^{i 13 π/4}.

(√2)^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * √2.

13 π/4 is 3π + π/4, which reduces to π + π/4 = 5π/4. So, e^{i5π/4} is cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -√2/2 -i√2/2.

So, (1 +i)^13 = 64√2 * (-√2/2 - i√2/2) = 64 * (-2/2 - i 2/2) = 64*(-1 -i) = -64(1 +i). Correct.

Similarly, (1 -i)^13: magnitude √2, angle -π/4. So, (√2)^13 * e^{-i13π/4}.

e^{-i13π/4} = e^{-i(12π/4 + π/4)} = e^{-i3π - iπ/4} = e^{-iπ/4} because e^{-i3π} = e^{-iπ} since 3π is π modulo 2π. Wait, no. Let me think:

Wait, -13π/4 is the same as (-13π/4 + 4π) = ( -13π +16π ) /4 = 3π/4. So, e^{-i13π/4} = e^{i3π/4}, which is cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) = -√2/2 + i√2/2.

So, (1 -i)^13 = 64√2 * ( -√2/2 + i√2/2 ) = 64√2 * (-√2/2 (1 -i) ) = 64*(-1 +i). So, -64(1 -i). Correct.

So, everything seems consistent.

Thus, the product is indeed 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but hold on. Let me compute 8321 divided by 1000.

1000 * 8 = 8000. 8321 -8000= 321. So yes, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me check for any possible mistake in the step where I multiplied the two complex numbers.

(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321. Yes, that's correct.

So, I think the process is correct, and the answer is 321.


The problem requires finding the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

First, we rewrite each term \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) as \(z^2 - 2z + 2\) with \(z = \omega^k\). Factoring the quadratic gives \((z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\). Thus, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \times \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i))
\]

Recognizing that the product of \((x - \omega^k)\) for all \(k\) is \(x^{13} - 1\), we substitute \(x = 1 + i\) and \(x = 1 - i\):

\[
\left[(1 + i)^{13} - 1\right] \times \left[(1 - i)^{13} - 1\right]
\]

Calculating \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\) using polar form, we find:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i), \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i)
\]

Subtracting 1 from each term:

\[
[-64(1 + i) - 1] \times [-64(1 - i) - 1] = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)
\]

This product simplifies to:

\[
(-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Finally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.

\[
\boxed{321}
\]
