Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to find the greatest four-digit number, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Let me first understand the problem. N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. When any digit of N is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, I should probably start from 9999 and work my way down until I find a number that satisfies this condition. But that might take too long. Maybe I can find a smarter approach.

Let me think about the divisibility rule for 7. It's a bit more complicated than other rules, but one method is to take the last digit, double it, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7. But applying this rule for all four possible changes might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the problem mathematically. Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number.

Now, when any digit is changed to 1, the new number must be divisible by 7.

So, the four possible modified numbers are:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's call this N1.

2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let's call this N2.

3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let's call this N3.

4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me express each of these modulo 7.

First, let me note that 1000 ≡ 1000 mod 7. Let me compute 1000 divided by 7.

7*142 = 994. So 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 ≡ 100 mod 7. 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ≡ 3 mod 7 because 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

And 1 ≡ 1 mod 7.

Similarly, 1000a ≡ 6a mod 7,

100b ≡ 2b mod 7,

10c ≡ 3c mod 7,

d ≡ d mod 7.

So, let me compute each N modulo 7.

N1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ (6) + (2b) + (3c) + d mod 7.

N2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ (6a) + (2) + (3c) + d mod 7.

N3: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ (6a) + (2b) + (3) + d mod 7.

N4: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ (6a) + (2b) + (3c) + 1 mod 7.

Each of these must be ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, we have four congruence equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7. (from N1)

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7. (from N2)

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7. (from N3)

4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. (from N4)

Now, this gives us four equations modulo 7. Let me write them down:

Equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod 7. Since -6 mod 7 is 1, so 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7.

Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod 7. -2 mod 7 is 5, so 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7.

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod 7. -3 mod 7 is 4, so 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7.

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod 7. -1 mod 7 is 6, so 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7.

So, now we have four equations:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7. (Equation 1)

2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7. (Equation 2)

3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7. (Equation 3)

4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7. (Equation 4)

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract some of these equations to eliminate variables.

Let's see.

Let me subtract Equation 2 - Equation 1:

(6a + 3c + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 5 - 1 mod 7.

Simplify:

6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7.

Similarly, 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7. Let me note this as Equation 5.

Now, let's subtract Equation 3 - Equation 1:

(6a + 2b + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 4 - 1 mod 7.

Simplify:

6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7.

Equation 6: 6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation 4 - Equation 2:

(6a + 2b + 3c) - (6a + 3c + d) ≡ 6 -5 mod 7.

Simplify:

2b - d ≡ 1 mod 7.

Equation 7: 2b - d ≡ 1 mod 7.

Alternatively, maybe another combination.

Alternatively, let's see if I can express d from Equation 1.

From Equation 1: d ≡ 1 - 2b - 3c mod 7.

Similarly, from Equation 3: d ≡ 4 - 6a - 2b mod 7.

So, setting these equal:

1 - 2b - 3c ≡ 4 - 6a - 2b mod 7.

Simplify:

1 - 3c ≡ 4 - 6a mod 7.

So, moving all terms to left:

1 - 3c - 4 + 6a ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify:

6a - 3c - 3 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):

2a - c - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 2a - c ≡ 1 mod 7. Let me write that as Equation 8: 2a - c ≡ 1 mod 7.

Similarly, from Equation 6: 6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7.

Divide both sides by 3:

2a - c ≡ 1 mod 7.

Which is the same as Equation 8. So, consistent.

So, Equation 8: 2a - c ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, that's one equation.

Now, from Equation 5: 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7.

We can write 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7.

Similarly, Equation 7: 2b - d ≡ 1 mod 7.

And from Equation 1: d ≡ 1 - 2b - 3c mod 7.

So, substituting d into Equation 7:

2b - (1 - 2b - 3c) ≡ 1 mod 7.

Simplify:

2b -1 + 2b + 3c ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, 4b + 3c -1 ≡ 1 mod 7.

Which is 4b + 3c ≡ 2 mod 7. Let's call this Equation 9.

So, now, let's see what we have:

Equation 5: 6a - 2b ≡4 mod7.

Equation 8: 2a - c ≡1 mod7.

Equation 9: 4b + 3c ≡2 mod7.

So, with four variables a, b, c, d, but perhaps we can express variables in terms of others.

Let me try to express c in terms of a from Equation 8.

Equation 8: c ≡ 2a -1 mod7.

So, c = (2a -1) + 7k, where k is some integer. But since c is a digit, it's between 0 and 9, so possible values may vary.

Similarly, from Equation 5: 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me rearrange it as:

6a -4 ≡ 2b mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):

(6a -4)/2 ≡ b mod7.

But 6a/2 = 3a, and 4/2=2.

So, 3a - 2 ≡ b mod7.

So, b ≡ 3a -2 mod7. Let's note this as Equation 10.

So, b = (3a -2) + 7m, where m is an integer. Since b is a digit (0-9), possible values are limited.

Now, Equation 9: 4b +3c ≡2 mod7.

Let me substitute b and c from Equations 10 and 8 into Equation 9.

So, b ≡3a -2 mod7,

c ≡2a -1 mod7.

So, 4*(3a -2) +3*(2a -1) ≡2 mod7.

Compute:

12a -8 +6a -3 ≡2 mod7.

Combine like terms:

(12a +6a) + (-8 -3) ≡2 mod7.

18a -11 ≡2 mod7.

18a ≡2 +11 mod7.

18a ≡13 mod7.

But 13 mod7 is 6.

So, 18a ≡6 mod7.

But 18 mod7 is 4 (since 7*2=14, 18-14=4). So:

4a ≡6 mod7.

We can solve for a:

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod7. The inverse of 4 mod7 is 2 because 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, a ≡6*2 mod7.

a ≡12 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5.

So, a ≡5 mod7.

Since a is a digit (1-9, because it's the thousands place), possible values for a are 5 and 12, but since a has to be a digit, a=5.

So, a=5.

Now, plug a=5 into Equation 8: c ≡2*5 -1 mod7.

c ≡10 -1 ≡9 mod7.

9 mod7 is 2, so c≡2 mod7.

Since c is a digit (0-9), possible c values are 2 and 9.

But since we're looking for the greatest N, which is a four-digit number, we should aim for the largest possible digits. So, perhaps c=9? But let's see.

Wait, let me check if c=9 is possible or if c=2 is necessary.

Wait, from Equation 8: c=2a -1 +7k. a=5, so c=10-1=9 +7k. Since c can't be more than 9, because it's a digit, k must be 0. So c=9.

Wait, no, because 2a -1 is 10 -1=9, so c=9 mod7 is 2. Hmm, maybe I confused something.

Wait, Equation 8 is c ≡2a -1 mod7. So with a=5, c ≡10 -1=9 mod7, which is 2 mod7. So, c can be 2 or 9 because 2 and 9 are congruent mod7 (since 9-2=7). So, c can be either 2 or 9.

But since we want the largest possible N, we should prefer c=9.

Wait, but if c=9, then the thousands digit is 5, hundreds digit is b, tens digit is 9, and units digit is d.

Wait, but let's confirm if c=9 is possible.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

Since a=5, let's find b using Equation 10: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

So, b ≡15 -2=13 mod7.

13 mod7 is 6. So, b=6 +7n. Since b is a digit (0-9), possible b values are 6 and 13. But 13 is invalid, so b=6.

So, b=6.

Now, c can be 2 or 9 because c ≡2 mod7. Since 2 and 9 are both possible, but to maximize N, we should take c=9.

So, c=9.

Now, let's find d from Equation 1: d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

Plugging in b=6 and c=9:

d ≡1 -2*6 -3*9 mod7.

Compute:

1 -12 -27 =1 -12= -11; -11 -27= -38.

Compute -38 mod7.

7*5=35; 38-35=3; so -38 mod7 is -3 mod7=4.

So, d≡4 mod7.

Since d is a digit (0-9), possible d is 4 or 11, but 11 is invalid. So d=4.

Alternatively, d can be 4 or
