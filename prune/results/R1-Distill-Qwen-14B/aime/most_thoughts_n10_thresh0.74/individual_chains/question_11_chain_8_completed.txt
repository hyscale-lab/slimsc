Okay, so I have this complex math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First off, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be expressed in polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make the expression easier to handle because dealing with exponentials could simplify things.

So if \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). That should be helpful because both \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) can now be written in terms of the same angle \( \theta \).

Let me substitute these into the original expression:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplifying the constants:

- \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4 = 300 + 468i \)
- \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \)

So now the expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, I need to find the real part of this expression. So I'll compute the real parts of each term separately and then add them together.

First, let's compute \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \). Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \). Multiplying this out:

\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta
\]

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
300\cos\theta + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i - 468\sin\theta
\]

So the real part from this term is \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \).

Next, let's compute the real part of \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \). Similarly, \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Multiplying this out:

\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta
\]

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:

\[
24\cos\theta + (36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i + 36\sin\theta
\]

The real part from this term is \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \).

Now, adding the two real parts together:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta
\]

Simplifying the coefficients:

- \( 300 + 24 = 324 \)
- \( -468 + 36 = -432 \)

So the total real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Now, my goal is to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \( \theta \). So I need to maximize \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). 

I remember that expressions of the form \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \phi \) is some angle. The maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), since the cosine function has a maximum of 1.

Wait, but in this case, our expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \). Let me compute \( R \):

\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 000 + 14400 is 104,400? Wait, let me just calculate 324 squared.

Wait, 324 * 324. Let me compute it step by step:

First, 300 * 300 = 90,000. Then 300 * 24 = 7,200, and 24 * 300 = 7,200, and 24*24=576. So, (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 000 + 14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2. Let me compute that:

432 * 432. Hmm, 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2=1,024, and cross terms.

Alternatively, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600, plus 1,024 is 186,624.

But since B is -432, the square is the same. So R is sqrt(104,976 + 186,624).

Adding those: 104,976 +186,624. Let's see:

104,976 + 186,624. Adding the thousands: 100k + 180k = 280k. Then 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 280k +11,600 = 291,600.

So R = sqrt(291,600). What's sqrt(291600)?

Well, sqrt(291600) = sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916) * 10.

What's sqrt(2916)?

Let me see. 50^2 = 2500, 60^2=3600. So somewhere in between. Try 54^2=2916 because 54*54: 50*50=2500, 50*4=200, 4*50=200, 4*4=16. So 2500 + 200 +200 +16 = 2916. Yes! So sqrt(2916)=54. Therefore, sqrt(291600)=540.

So R is 540. Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, so R is sqrt(324² +432²). Which is sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ). As I calculated, 324² is 104,976 and 432² is 186,624. Adding them gives 291,600. Square root of that is 540. So yeah, the maximum is 540.

So the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), we express \( z \) in polar form as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Substituting this into the expression and simplifying, we find the real part in terms of \( \theta \) to be \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). The maximum value of this expression is given by the amplitude \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540 \). Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
