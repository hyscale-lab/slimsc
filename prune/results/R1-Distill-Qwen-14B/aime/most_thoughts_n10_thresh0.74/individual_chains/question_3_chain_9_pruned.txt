Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the setup: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. But she wins the grand prize only if all four of her numbers match. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. 

Alright, so the problem is about conditional probability. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is "winning the grand prize," and event B is "winning a prize." Since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize (if you win the grand prize, you definitely win a prize), then P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: P(A), which is the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning any prize (at least two numbers matching). 

Let me tackle P(A) first. Winning the grand prize means that all four numbers Jen picked are the same as the four randomly chosen. So, how many possible ways are there for the lottery to choose 4 numbers out of 10? That should be the combination C(10,4). And Jen has only one specific set of 4 numbers, so the probability is 1 / C(10,4). Let me compute that.

C(10,4) is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)! ) = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1) ) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers match the four randomly chosen. "At least two" can mean exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four. But wait, since she's picking four numbers, and the lottery is also picking four, the maximum overlap is four. So, "at least two" is exactly two, three, or four matching numbers.

Alternatively, it's easier sometimes to compute the probability of the complementary event and subtract from 1. The complementary event of "at least two" is "zero or one" matching numbers. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

Let me compute P(zero matches) first. This is the probability that none of Jen's four numbers are in the four randomly chosen. So, the lottery chooses four numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). So, the number of ways to choose four numbers not including any of Jen's is C(6,4). So, P(zero matches) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

C(6,4) is 15, as 6!/(4!2!) = (6*5)/2 = 15. So, P(zero matches) = 15/210 = 1/14.

Next, P(one match). This is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is in the lottery's four. To compute this, we can think of it as choosing 1 number from Jen's 4, and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. So, the number of favorable combinations is C(4,1)*C(6,3).

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, P(one match) = 80 / 210.

So, P(B) is 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210. Simplifying that, 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5: 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, P(B)=23/42.

Wait, let me check that subtraction again: 15 +
