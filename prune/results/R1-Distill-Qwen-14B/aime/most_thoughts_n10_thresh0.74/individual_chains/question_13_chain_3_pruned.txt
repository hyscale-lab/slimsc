Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at s+1/2 kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Alright, so Aya walks 9 kilometers. At different speeds, she takes different times, but each time, t minutes are spent in the coffee shop. So the total time she spends is the walking time plus t.

First, let's note down the given data:

1. At speed s km/h, total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes of coffee break.
2. At speed s+2 km/h, total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes.
3. We need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t.

Wait, but the problem is about the walking time plus the coffee time. So, the total time is walking time + t.

But wait, the total time includes t, so maybe we can write equations where total time is 4 hours = walking time (in hours) + t (in hours). Similarly for the second case.

Let me structure the information:

First scenario:
- Speed: s km/h
- Walking time: let's denote it as T1 hours
- Total time including coffee: 4 hours
So, T1 + t = 4.

But wait, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. Wait, no, the problem says when she walks at speed s, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes. So, the entire duration, including coffee, is 4 hours. So, the walking time would be 4 hours minus t minutes.

But wait, t is in minutes. So, I need to convert everything into the same units. Maybe
