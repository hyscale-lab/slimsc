Okay, so I've got this problem here that I need to solve. It says: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying two conditions. The first condition is that a + b + c = 300. The second condition is a bit more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Let me see. So, I'm dealing with a system of equations with three variables. The first one is linear, and the second one is quadratic. Since it's asking for the number of nonnegative integer solutions, I need to find all possible (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

Let me write down the equations again to get a clearer picture:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I wonder if there's a way to simplify the second equation. It looks symmetric in a, b, c, so maybe I can factor it somehow.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor out common terms or factor in terms of (a + b + c).

Let me try factoring:

a²b + a²c can be written as a²(b + c).
Similarly, b²a + b²c can be written as b²(a + c).
And c²a + c²b can be written as c²(a + b).

So, the second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable. Now, since we know from the first equation that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c).

Let me try that substitution:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So, expanding each term:

= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³
= 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

Therefore, the equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now I have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Is there a way to relate this to the first equation? Let's remember that a + b + c = 300.

I also know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, from that, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (ab + ac + bc).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + ac + bc, and P = abc.

Wait, but in the equation above, I have a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can find expressions for these in terms of S, Q, and P.

I know that a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q.

And for a³ + b³ + c³, there's a formula: a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3P.

So substituting these into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 300(S² - 2Q) - (S³ - 3S Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Since S = 300, let's substitute that in.

First, compute S²: 300² = 90,000.

Then, 300(S² - 2Q) = 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Next, compute S³: 300³ = 27,000,000.

Then, the other part is -(S³ - 3S Q + 3P) = -27,000,000 + 3*300*Q - 3P = -27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P.

Putting it all together:

[27,000,000 - 600Q] + [-27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P] = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

27,000,000 - 600Q -27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

The 27,000,000 and -27,000,000 cancel each other.

So, (-600Q + 900Q) - 3P = 6,000,000.

That's (300Q) - 3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So now, we have a new equation: 100Q - P = 2,000,000. Let's write that down.

We also know that Q = ab + ac + bc.

But wait, we have another equation involving Q and P. Hmm, I wonder if we can find another equation to relate Q and P.

But wait, the only other equation we have is a + b + c = 300, and we're dealing with symmetric sums, so perhaps using symmetric polynomials might be a way.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider specific cases where two variables are equal or something like that. But since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps we can assume certain orderings, like a ≤ b ≤ c, and then count the number of solutions in that case and multiply appropriately.

Wait, but since we're dealing with triples, each permutation of a, b, c would count as a separate solution unless two or all three are equal.

Hmm, but this approach might get complicated. Maybe it's better to try to express everything in terms of S, Q, and P.

We have S = 300, and we have 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

But we need another equation to relate Q and P. Wait, perhaps we can use the identity that for any three variables:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 +
