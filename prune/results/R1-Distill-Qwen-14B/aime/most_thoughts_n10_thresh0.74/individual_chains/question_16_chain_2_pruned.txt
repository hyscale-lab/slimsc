Alright, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime p such that p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I find that p, I then have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8. Wait, let me think again. So, if p is a prime, and we're looking at n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then we can say that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p. For that to happen, the multiplicative order of -1 modulo p must divide 4. But -1 has order 2, so maybe p needs to satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, let me recall the conditions for a number to be a quartic residue. If p is an odd prime, then -1 is a quartic residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, and for -1 to be in the subgroup of fourth powers, 2 must divide (p-1)/4. So, (p-1)/4 must be even, meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8. So p must be 1 mod 8.

Alternatively, maybe it's primes where 8 divides p-1. So the primes would be 17, 97, etc. Hmm.

But wait, the problem is about p² dividing n⁴ + 1. So not just that p divides n⁴ +1, but p² does. So it's not just that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, but also that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

So perhaps I need to look for primes p where the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution.

I remember that for primes p ≡ 1 mod 4, -1 is a quadratic residue, but for quartic residues, it's more restrictive.

Let me think about small primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8. The smallest such primes are 17, 97,  etc. Wait, no, wait. 17 is 1 mod 16, but wait, mod 8 is 1.

Wait, 17 mod 8 is indeed 1. But what about smaller primes? Like, 2 is a prime, but 2²=4. Let's see if 2² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Let me test n=1: 1 +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is
