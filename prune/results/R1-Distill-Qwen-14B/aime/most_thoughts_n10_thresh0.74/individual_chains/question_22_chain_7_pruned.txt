Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the sides are equal, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel. Interesting. The problem also says that when you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or something? Wait, no, a regular hexagon has all sides equal and all angles equal, but here it's just equilateral and opposite sides are parallel. So, it's not necessarily regular.

Since opposite sides are parallel, this hexagon is what's called a "zonogon." I remember that term from somewhere. A zonogon is a convex polygon with opposite sides equal and parallel. So, yeah, that fits the description here.

Now, when they say that extending AB, CD, and EF forms a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300, I think those are the lengths of the sides of the triangle after the extensions. So, if I imagine extending those sides until they meet, they form a triangle. My goal is to find the side length of the hexagon.

I think I should draw a diagram to help me understand this better. Since I can't actually draw it, I'll try to sketch it mentally. Let's label the hexagon ABCDEF, with AB opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. All sides are equal length, say 's'.

Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a combination of a triangle and three parallelograms. Or maybe it's a translated polygon where each pair of opposite sides are translated copies of each other.

Wait, another thought: in such a hexagon, the sides AB, CD, EF can be considered as vectors. Since opposite sides are parallel and equal in length (because it's equilateral), their vectors would be the same or negatives of each other.

But how does extending AB, CD, EF create a triangle? Let me think. If I extend AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, they should meet at some points forming a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300.

I think this triangle is related to the concept of the "outer triangle" of the hexagon. Maybe similar to the outer triangle formed by extending the sides of a regular hexagon, but in this case, the hexagon isn't regular, so the outer triangle has different side lengths.

I recall that in such cases, the side length of the hexagon can be found using the formula involving the sides of the outer triangle. I think the formula is something like the side length 's' is equal to (a*b*c)/(a*b + a*c + b*c), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should derive it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use similar triangles or coordinate geometry. Let's try coordinate geometry because I can assign coordinates and solve equations.

Let me place the hexagon in a coordinate system. Let me assume point A is at (0, 0). Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, I can assign vectors to the sides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the hexagon with vectors. Let me denote each side as a vector. Since opposite sides are equal and parallel, the vectors for AB and DE are the same, BC and EF are the same, and CD and FA are the same.

But wait, in a convex polygon, the sides turn in the same direction. So, each consecutive side is a 60-degree rotation of the previous one? No, wait, that's for a regular hexagon. Here, the angles can be different.

Alternatively, since opposite sides are parallel, their direction vectors are the same. So, vectors AB and DE are same, BC and EF are same, CD and FA are same.

But how does that help? Maybe I can represent the hexagon as a closed
