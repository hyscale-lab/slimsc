Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, there's a torus T, which is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle, and this axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. Think of it like a donut shape. Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. 

The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i. And when T rests on the outside of S, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should visualize this. A torus is like a donut, right? It has two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, the minor radius is 3 because the circle being revolved has radius 3. The major radius R is the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution, which is 6. So R = 6, r = 3.

Now, the sphere has radius 11. So when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the torus is touching the sphere from the inside. When it's outside, it's touching from the outside. I need to find the radii of these tangent circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and the sphere are tangent. Since they're tangent along a circle, that circle must lie on both surfaces. So, perhaps I can find the equations of the torus and the sphere and then find their points of tangency.

Let me write down the equations. The sphere S with radius 11 centered at the origin would have the equation x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

For the torus T, its equation can be written in terms of the major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin, with the z-axis as the axis of revolution, is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r². So substituting R = 6 and r = 3, the equation becomes (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9.

But wait, the problem says the torus is placed inside and outside the sphere. So perhaps the sphere is centered at the same origin as the torus? I think that's a safe assumption unless stated otherwise.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it touches the sphere at some circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it touches along another circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, respectively.

I need to find r_i and r_o. Let me think about how to find the points of tangency.

When two surfaces are tangent, their tangent planes at the point of tangency are the same. That means their normals at that point are colinear. So, if I can find a point where both the torus and the sphere have the same normal vector, that should be a point of tangency.

Alternatively, since both the sphere and the torus are surfaces of revolution, their points of tangency should lie along a circle that's also a circle of revolution, which would make sense why the tangent lines form a circle.

Another approach might be to consider the distance from the origin to the center of the tube of the torus. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, which is 6 units from the center of that circle. So, the center of the tube is at radius 6 from the origin.

Wait, but when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11. So the distance from the origin to the center of the tube of the torus is 6, and the sphere's radius is 11. So, perhaps the maximum distance from the origin on the torus is 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 11, so the torus can fit inside the sphere. Similarly, when placed outside, the torus would have points that go out to 6 + 3 = 9, but the sphere is 11, so I'm not sure. Wait, no, when placed outside, the torus would enclose the sphere or vice versa? Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the external tangency is when the torus is outside the sphere, but it's externally tangent, so the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along a circle. Alternatively, perhaps the external tangency is when the torus is outside the sphere and just touching it. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize.

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's like a donut inside a bigger sphere. The point of tangency would be the point on the torus that's farthest from the origin, right? Because the sphere is larger. So that would be the outer edge of the torus, which is at a distance of R + r = 6 + 3 = 9 from the origin. But the sphere's radius is 11, which is larger than 9, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere, except for the point where it just touches. Wait, no, if the torus is entirely inside except for a point, but in this problem, it's tangent along a whole circle. So perhaps the circle of tangency is not the outermost point but somewhere else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps I should consider the distance from the origin to the center of the tube of the torus. The center of the tube is at (0,0,0) because the torus is centered there. Wait, no, the torus is generated by revolving a circle around the z-axis, which is 6 units away from the center of the original circle. So the center of the original circle is at (6,0,0) in the plane, right? Wait, no, that can't be right because when you revolve around the z-axis, the center of the circle being revolved is at (0,0
