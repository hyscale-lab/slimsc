Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Alright, so N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number with a specific property: if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

Hmm, that's interesting. So for every digit in N, replacing it with 1 gives a number that's a multiple of 7.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can represent N as a four-digit number, say N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So A is the thousands digit, B is hundreds, C is tens, and D is units.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, for example:

- Changing A to 1: 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
- Changing B to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.
- Changing C to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.
- Changing D to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So all four of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, I probably want to maximize N as much as possible, starting from 9999 and moving down until I find a number that satisfies all these conditions.

But checking each number one by one would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the divisibility by 7. If changing a digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7, then the original number N must be congruent to something modulo 7.

Let's denote N as ABCD, so N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we replace a digit, say the thousands digit A with 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this N1. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives N2, replacing C with 1 gives N3, and replacing D with 1 gives N4.

Since all N1, N2, N3, N4 are divisible by 7, we can write:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, let's express each of these in terms of N. Let's see:

N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So N1 = (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) - 1000(A - 1) = N - 1000(A - 1)

Wait, that might not be the most straightforward way. Let me instead think about N1 in terms of N.

Wait, N1 is changing A to 1, so N1 = 1*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + D.

Similarly, N = A*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + D.

So N1 = N - (A*1000) + 1*1000.

So N1 = N - 1000*(A - 1).

Since N1 is divisible by 7, we have N1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So N - 1000*(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod7.

But 1000 mod7: Let me compute that.

7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

So 1000*(A-1) ≡6*(A-1) mod7.

So N - 6*(A-1) ≡0 mod7.

But N ≡ something mod7, so N ≡6*(A-1) mod7.

Similarly, let's do this for each digit change.

For replacing B with 1:

N2 = A*1000 + 1*100 + C*10 + D.

N2 = N - 100*(B - 1).

So N2 ≡0 mod7.

100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡2 mod7. So 100*(B-1) ≡2*(B-1) mod7.

Thus, N - 2*(B -1) ≡0 mod7.

So N ≡2*(B -1) mod7.

Similarly, for replacing C with 1:

N3 = A*1000 + B*100 + 1*10 + D.

N3 = N - 10*(C -1).

10 mod7 is 3, so 10*(C-1)≡3*(C-1) mod7.

So N - 3*(C -1) ≡0 mod7.

Thus, N ≡3*(C -1) mod7.

For replacing D with 1:

N4 = A*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + 1.

N4 = N - (D -1)*1.

So N4 = N - (D -1).

Thus, N - (D -1) ≡0 mod7.

So N ≡ (D -1) mod7.

Wait, so from all four conditions:

1. N ≡6*(A-1) mod7

2. N ≡2*(B-1) mod7

3. N ≡3*(C-1) mod7

4. N ≡ (D -1) mod7

So all four congruences must hold for N.

Therefore, N must satisfy all four of these conditions. So, all four expressions must be congruent modulo7.

So:

6*(A-1) ≡2*(B-1) ≡3*(C-1) ≡(D-1) mod7.

Hmm, so all these must be equal modulo7.

Let me denote that common value as k mod7. So,

6*(A-1) ≡k mod7

2*(B-1) ≡k mod7

3*(C-1) ≡k mod7

(D-1) ≡k mod7

So, each of these expressions equals k modulo7.

So, for each digit, we can write:

A ≡ (k/6 +1) mod7

B ≡ (k/2 +1) mod7

C ≡ (k/3 +1) mod7

D ≡ (k +1) mod7

Wait, but division in modular arithmetic requires that the modulus is prime, and the divisor is coprime to the modulus.

Since 7 is prime, and 6, 2, 3 are all factors, but their inverses exist only if they are coprime to 7.

Wait, 6,
