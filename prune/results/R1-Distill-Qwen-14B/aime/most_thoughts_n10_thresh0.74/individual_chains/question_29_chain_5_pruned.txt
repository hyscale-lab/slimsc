Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, okay, so that circle must pass through those four points. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Let me visualize this. So, there are two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Rectangle EFGH would have sides EF, FG, GH, HE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line must be the line DC where these points lie. Wait, but ABCD is a rectangle, so DC is one of its sides, right? So DC is equal to AB because in a rectangle opposite sides are equal. Therefore, DC is 107, same as AB.

But wait, BC is 16, so the sides of rectangle ABCD are AB=107, BC=16. So ABCD is a rectangle with length 107 and width 16. Now, rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. So EFGH is a much longer and skinnier rectangle.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, I imagine that E and F are points along the line DC, which is 107 units long. So E and F are somewhere between D and C, or maybe even beyond, but considering the rectangles, I think E and F are between D and C.

The fact that A, D, H, G lie on a circle is crucial here. Let me think about what that implies. If four points lie on a circle, they must satisfy the cyclic quadrilateral properties. So, maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.

Let me try to sketch the problem mentally. Let me label the points. So ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107, BC=16. So let's say point A is at the origin (0,0). Then B would be at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). But wait, the rectangle could be in any orientation, but since D and C are on a line with E and F, which are points of another rectangle... Hmm, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let me place point D at (0,0). Then since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is (0,0), then C would be at (something, 0), but wait no, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. If I place D at (0,0), then since DC is a side, let's say DC is along the x-axis. So point C would be at (107, 0), because DC = AB = 107. Then point B would be at (107,1
