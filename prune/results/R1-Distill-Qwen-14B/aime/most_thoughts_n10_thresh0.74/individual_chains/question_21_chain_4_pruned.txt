Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). 

The task is to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the minimal b where the number of b-eautiful n exceeds 10.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, I should understand what it means for a number n to be a two-digit number in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is written as 'd1 d2', where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d2 is the units place. So, the value of n in decimal is d1*b + d2.

But wait, n can also be expressed in base b. So, n is equal to d1*b + d2, where d1 and d2 are digits in base b. That means d1 must be less than b (since it's a digit in base b) and d2 must also be less than b. However, since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. So, d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d2 is between 0 and b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, d1 + d2, equals the square root of n. So, d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). But since n = d1*b + d2, this gives us the equation:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 = d1*b + d2

Let's rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 - d1*b - d2 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d2. Maybe I can rearrange terms to make it more manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as:

Let s = d1 + d2. Then, s = sqrt(n), so n = s^2. But n is also d1*b + d2. So,

s^2 = d1*b + d2

But since s = d1 + d2, we can write:

s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)

So, s^2 = d1*b + s - d1

Let's bring all terms to one side:

s^2 - s = d1*b - d1

Factor out d1 on the right:

s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)

Then, solving for d1:

d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

But d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and s is the sum of two digits, so s can range from 1+0=1 up to (b-1)+(b-1)=2b-2. But since d1 is a positive integer, s must be at least 1.

Wait, but s is d1 + d2, so s can vary
