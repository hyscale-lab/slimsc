Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². 

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. Once I find that p, then I have to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me break it down. Maybe I should start by checking small primes and see if p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n.

I remember that for primes, certain conditions must hold for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

First, let's think about small primes and see if they satisfy this condition.

Starting with p=2: Let me check if n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 2²=4. Let's see, n can be 1, 2, 3, etc. 

n=1: 1 +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. 
n=2: 16 +1=17, which is not divisible by 4.
n=3: 81 +1=82, which is not divisible by 4.
Wait, but 82 divided by 4 is 20.5, so not an integer. Hmm. So for p=2, is there any n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4?

Wait, actually, for even n: n=2k, n⁴=16k⁴, so n⁴ +1=16k⁴ +1. 16k⁴ is 0 mod 4, so 16k⁴ +1 ≡1 mod 4. So it's 1 mod 4, not 0. So n⁴ +1 is either 2 mod 4 (if n is odd) or 1 mod 4 (if n is even). So it's never 0 mod 4. So p=2 can't be such a prime.

Next prime is p=3. Let's check if there exists an n where n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 9.

So n⁴ ≡-1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1,2,3,...,8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1⁴=1 → 1 mod9 → 1≡-1? No, because 1≡1, and -1≡8 mod9. So 1≠8.

n=2: 16 mod9=7. 7≡-1? 7 vs 8. No.

n=3: 81 mod9=0. 0≡-1? No.

n=4: 256 mod9. 256 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, remainder 4. So 4≡-1 mod9? 4 vs8. No.

n=5: 625 mod9. Let's compute 625/9: 9*69=621, remainder 4. So 4≡-1? No.

n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod9=0. Not -1.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401/9: 9*266=2394, remainder 7. So 7≡-1? 7 vs 8. No.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: Let's compute 4096 - 9*455=4096-4095=1. So 1≡-1? No.

So for p=3, no n satisfies n⁴ ≡-1 mod9. So p=3 is out.

Next prime, p=5. Let's check if there's an n where n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

So n⁴ ≡-1 mod25. Let's see if any n in 1 to 24 satisfies this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute n^4 mod25 for n from 1 to 12 (since mod25 is symmetric for n and 25-n).

n=1: 1 mod25. 1≡-1? No.

n=2: 16 mod25. 16≡-1? 16 vs 24. No.

n=3: 81 mod25=6. 6≡-1? No.

n=4: 256 mod25. 25*10=250, 256-250=6. So 6≡-1? No.

n=5: 0 mod25. No.

n=6: 6^4=1296. 1296/25=51*25=1275, remainder 21. 21≡-1? 21 vs24. No.

n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401-25*96=2401-2400=1. 1≡-1? No.

n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod25. 25*163=4075, 4096-4075=21. 21≡-1? No.

n=9: 9^4=6561. 6561 mod25: 25*262=6550, 6561-6550=11. 11≡-1? No.

n=10: 10^4=10000. 10000 mod25=0. No.

n=11: 11^4=14641. 14641 mod25: 25*585=14625, 14641-14625=16. 16≡-1? No.

n=12: 12^4=20736. 20736 mod25: 25*829=20725, 20736-20725=11. 11≡-1? No.

Wait, so none of n=1 to 12 gives n⁴ ≡24 mod25, which is -1 mod25. So p=5 also doesn't work.

Next prime, p=7. Let's check if any n exists such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod49.

Hmm, 49 is a bit more work. But perhaps there's a pattern.

Alternatively, maybe I can find whether -1 is a quartic residue mod 7²=49.

Wait, perhaps I should recall some number theory.

I remember that for a prime p, the equation x² ≡ a mod p has solutions depending on whether a is a quadratic residue. Similarly, for higher powers.

But for quartic residues, it's more complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of the multiplicative order.

Wait, if I can find an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49, then (-1) must be a quartic residue mod49.
