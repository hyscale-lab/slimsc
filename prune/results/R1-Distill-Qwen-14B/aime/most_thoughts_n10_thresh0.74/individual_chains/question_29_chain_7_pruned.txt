Alright, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. Okay, so we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me visualize this. So, ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. That means AB=CD=107 and BC=AD=16. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, so EF=GH=184 and FG=EH=17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they all lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line l. So, points D and C are from rectangle ABCD, and E and F are from rectangle EFGH. So, line l has points D, E, C, F in that order? Or maybe in some other order? Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order is D, E, C, F along the line.

So, the line l is DC, with E somewhere between D and C, and F beyond C? Or wait, no, because it's D, E, C, F. So, starting from D, going through E, then C, then F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C on the same line.

Now, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, that's four points on a circle, which means they are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Wait, let me sketch this mentally. Rectangle ABCD: points A, B, C, D in order. So, A is connected to B and D, B to C, etc. Similarly, EFGH: E, F, G, H in order. So, E connected to F and H, F to G, etc.

Points A, D, H, G on a circle. Hmm. So, point A is from ABCD, D is the corner, H is from EFGH, and G is another corner of EFGH.

I think I should assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let's assign a coordinate system. Letâ€™s place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0) because DC is equal to AB=107. Then, point B would be at (107,16) and point A at (0,16).

Wait, hold on. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if AB is 107 and BC is 16, then AB is the length and BC is the width. So, if D is at (0,0), then point C would be at (BC, 0) or (0, BC)? Hmm, maybe I should clarify the orientation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign
