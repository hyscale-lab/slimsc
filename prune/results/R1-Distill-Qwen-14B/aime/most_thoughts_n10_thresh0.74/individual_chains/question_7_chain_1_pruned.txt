Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.

First, let's understand the problem. We have a regular octagon, which means it has 8 sides, all equal, with each internal angle equal too. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each color with a 50% chance. So, for each vertex, the color is independent, like flipping a fair coin for each one.

Now, the question is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon in such a way that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, after rotation, all the blue ones have moved to where reds were, and maybe the red ones have moved to blue positions or something else. But the key is that after some rotation, the blue vertices are now on top of the original red ones.

I think this is related to group theory, specifically the rotation symmetries of the octagon. The octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which are 8 different positions. Each rotation can be thought of as a permutation of the vertices.

So, maybe I need to consider the colorings that are fixed by some rotation. But wait, not fixed, but such that when you apply a rotation, the blue vertices are moved to where red were. Let me think about it differently.

Suppose the original coloring is C. After rotating by k positions (k=0 to 7), the new coloring C' must have all blue vertices in positions that were red in C. So, for each blue vertex in C', it was red in C. That implies that for each vertex in C', if it's blue, then the corresponding vertex in C must have been red.

But C' is just a rotation of C. So, for each vertex in C, if it's blue, then the vertex k positions ahead (because of the rotation) in C must have been red. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should model this as a permutation.

Let me think: each rotation can be considered as a permutation of the vertices. So, if I have a permutation σ corresponding to a rotation by k positions, then the condition is that for each vertex i, if C(i) is blue, then C'(σ(i)) must be blue, and since C' is just C rotated, that means C(σ^{-1}(i)) must be blue. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model this as a function. Let’s say that for each vertex i, if we color it blue, then after rotation, it's now at position j, and in the original coloring, j was red. So, for all blue vertices i, the original vertex at position (i - k) mod 8 must have been red.

Wait, that might make more sense. Let me try to formalize it.

Let’s denote the rotation by k positions. So, each vertex i is moved to position (i + k) mod 8. So, if a vertex i is blue in the original coloring, after rotation by k, it moves to (i + k) mod 8. For the condition to hold, all these positions (i + k) mod 8 must have been red originally.

So, for the coloring to satisfy the condition, for this specific k, every vertex that is blue must be such that when you rotate it k positions, it lands on a red vertex. But wait, because the octagon is being rotated, so the entire coloring is shifted. Therefore, the set of blue vertices after rotation is equal to the set of red vertices originally.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If I rotate the octagon by k positions, then each blue vertex moves to a new position. For the condition to hold, each of these new positions must have been red in the original coloring. So, the set of blue vertices in the rotated octagon is exactly the set of red vertices in the original octagon. But since the octagon is regular, the set of blue vertices after rotation is just the original set shifted by k.

So, the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a shifted version of the set of red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, the set of red vertices must be a rotation of the set of blue vertices. So, the blue vertices are a shifted version of the red vertices.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so that if the blue set is a shifted version of the red set, they must be rotations of each other. So, for a given coloring, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then such a rotation exists.

So, in other words, the colorings where the blue vertices are a rotation of the red vertices would satisfy the condition. So, the probability is the number of such colorings divided by the total number of colorings.

The total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256, since each vertex can be red or blue independently.

So, how many colorings are such that the blue set is a rotation of the red set? Let's think about that.

First, note that the blue set and the red set are complementary. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the red set must be a rotation of the blue set as well.

So, for a coloring to satisfy the condition, the blue vertices must form a rotation of the red vertices. So, the blue set is a shifted version of the red set.

So, how many colorings have that property? Let's think.

Suppose the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Then, the blue set is a translated version of the red set. So, the blue set is a cyclic shift of the red set.

But how many such colorings are there?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of orbits. The colorings can be grouped by the symmetries of the octagon. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for each possible rotation k, the number of colorings fixed by that rotation would be 2^{number of orbits under rotation k}.

Wait, maybe that's a Burnside's lemma approach. Burnside's lemma says that the number of colorings fixed by a group action is equal to the average number of fixed colorings over the group elements.

Wait, but in this case, we're not counting colorings fixed by a rotation, but rather colorings for which there exists a rotation such that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for each possible rotation, count the number
