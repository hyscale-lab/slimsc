Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says: Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes in the coffee shop. When she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find how many minutes her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that the time she spends walking varies with her speed, but the time spent in the coffee shop (t minutes) remains the same in both cases. So, t is constant.

Let me note down the given information:

1. Distance walked: 9 km.
2. When speed = s km/h, total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes. This includes walking time plus t minutes.
3. When speed = (s + 2) km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes. Again, includes walking time plus t.

So, I can model this with two equations. Let me see.

The time spent walking without the coffee break would be total time minus t. So, for the first case:

Walking time = total time - coffee time
=> Walking time1 = (240 - t) minutes.

Similarly, for the second case:

Walking time2 = (144 - t) minutes.

But walking time can also be calculated as distance divided by speed, right? Because time = distance / speed.

So, for the first scenario:
Walking time1 (in hours) = 9 / s.

But wait, the units. Because in the first case, the walking time is (240 - t) minutes, which is (240 - t)/60 hours. So, that equals 9 / s.

Similarly, the second scenario:
Walking time2 (in hours) = 9 / (s + 2) = (144 - t)/60.

So, I can write two equations:

1. (240 - t)/60 = 9 / s
2. (144 - t)/60 = 9 / (s + 2)

These are my two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these simultaneously to find s and t.

Let me write them clearly:

Equation (1): (240 - t)/60 = 9/s

Equation (2): (144 - t)/60 = 9/(s + 2)

I can rearrange both equations to express t in terms of s.

Starting with Equation (1):

Multiply both sides by 60:

240 - t = 60 * (9/s)

=> 240 - t = 540 / s

=> t = 240 - (540 / s)    ... Equation (1a)

Similarly, Equation (2):

144 - t = 60 * (9/(s + 2))

=> 144 - t = 540 / (s + 2)

=> t = 144 - (540 / (s + 2))   ... Equation (2a)

Now, since both Equation (1a) and (2a) equal t, I can set them equal to each other:

240 - (540 / s) = 144 - (540 / (s + 2))

Let me rearrange this equation:

240 - 144 = (540 / s) - (540 / (s + 2))

96 = 540 (1/s - 1/(s + 2))

Simplify the right-hand side:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] ) = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, 96 = 540 * [2 / (s(s + 2))]

Compute the right side:

540 * 2 = 1080

So, 96 = 1080 / [s(s + 2)]

Multiply both sides by [s(s + 2)]:

96 s(s + 2) = 1080

Divide both sides by 96:

s(s + 2) = 1080 / 96

Compute 1080 ÷ 96:

Let me see, 96 × 11 = 1056, 1080 - 1056 = 24, so 11 + 24/96 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Which is a quadratic equation:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me solve this quadratic equation for s.

Using the quadratic formula:

s = [ -2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-11.25) ) ] / (2 * 1)

Compute discriminant:

(2)^2 = 4

4 * 1 * 11.25 = 45

So discriminant is 4 + 45 = 49

So, sqrt(49) = 7

So, s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

We can discard the negative solution since speed can't be negative.

So, s = ( -2 +7 ) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

So, s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t.

Using Equation (1a): t = 240 - (540 / s)

s = 2.5, so 540 / 2.5 = 216

So, t = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is asking: when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how long does her walk take, including t minutes.

So, first, compute her new speed: s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

Now, compute the walking time without coffee: distance / speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Convert that to minutes: 3 hours = 180 minutes.

Then, add the coffee time, t = 24 minutes.

Total time = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm.

Wait, wait. When she walks at s + 1/2, which is 3 km/h, the walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then, the coffee shop time is 24 minutes. So, total is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

But let me double-check my calculations.

So, s = 2.5 km/h, correct?

Because from the first scenario, 9 km at 2.5 km/h takes 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes. Then, total time is 4 hours, so coffee time is 4h - 3h36m = 24 minutes. That matches t=24.

Similarly, in the second scenario, speed is 4.5 km/h (since s + 2 = 2.5 + 2 = 4.5). Walking time is 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours. Total time is 2h24m, so coffee time is 24m. That also matches.

So, when speed is 3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours. So, 3h + 24m = 204 minutes. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem.

The problem says: "the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So, the total time from start to finish is 4 hours, which includes both walking and coffee time.

Yes, so when she walks at 2.5 km/h, the walking time is 3.6 hours, and coffee is 0.4 hours, which is 24 minutes. All right.

So, when she walks at 3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes coffee, total 204 minutes.

So, the answer should be 204 minutes. But wait, let me make sure there's no mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 2.5 km/h is 2.5, adding 0.5 makes 3 km/h, correct.

Walking time: 9 km /3 km/h = 3 hours → 180 minutes.

Plus 24 minutes coffee: 180 +24=204.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, I think the answer is 204 minutes.


Aya walks 9 kilometers each morning. When walking at speed \( s \) km/h, the total time taken is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in a coffee shop. When walking at \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, also including \( t \) minutes. We need to find the total time when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including \( t \) minutes.

First, we set up the equations for the walking times without coffee breaks:
\[
\frac{9}{s} = \frac{240 - t}{60} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{9}{s + 2} = \frac{144 - t}{60}
\]
Simplifying these, we find:
\[
240 - t = \frac{540}{s} \quad \text{and} \quad 144 - t = \frac{540}{s + 2}
\]
Equating the expressions for \( t \):
\[
240 - \frac{540}{s} = 144 - \frac{540}{s + 2}
\]
Simplifying leads to the quadratic equation:
\[
s(s + 2) = 11.25
\]
Solving, we find \( s = 2.5 \) km/h. Substituting back, \( t = 24 \) minutes.

When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]
Including the coffee break:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
