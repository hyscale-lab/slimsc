Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that's interesting. I've dealt with complex numbers before, but I'm not sure how to approach this exactly. Let me try to break it down.

First, I know that any complex number \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers. But since we know the magnitude of \( z \) is 4, we can also represent it in polar form. So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier, especially when dealing with multiplication and division of complex numbers.

So, let me rewrite the expression using polar form. The first term is \( (75 + 117i)z \). If \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then multiplying by \( 75 + 117i \) would involve multiplying the magnitudes and adding the angles. Similarly, the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( 1/z \) would be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \), because the magnitude of \( 1/z \) is \( 1/|z| \) and the angle is the negative of the original angle.

So, let me compute each part step by step.

First, let's compute \( (75 + 117i)z \). Since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), this becomes \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). Let me find the magnitude and angle of \( 75 + 117i \) to make this easier. The magnitude is \( \sqrt{75^2 + 117^2} \). Let me calculate that.

75 squared is 5625, and 117 squared is 13689. Adding those together: 5625 + 13689 = 19314. So, the magnitude is \( \sqrt{19314} \). Let me see if that simplifies. Hmm, 19314 divided by 9 is 2146, which isn't a perfect square. So, maybe I can just leave it as \( \sqrt{19314} \) for now. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it further. Let me see: 75 and 117 have a common factor of 3. So, 75 = 3*25, and 117 = 3*39. So, perhaps 75 + 117i = 3*(25 + 39i). So, magnitude is 3*sqrt(25^2 + 39^2). 25 squared is 625, 39 squared is 1521. Adding those: 625 + 1521 = 2146. So, the magnitude is 3*sqrt(2146). Hmm, okay, that's still a bit messy, but maybe manageable.

The angle of \( 75 + 117i \) is \( \arctan(117/75) \). Let me compute that. 117 divided by 75 is 1.56. So, arctangent of 1.56 is approximately 57 degrees. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Since tan(57 degrees) is about 1.5399, which is close to 1.56, so perhaps around 57.2 degrees. Let me just keep it as \( \phi = \arctan(117/75) \).

So, the first term becomes \( 3\sqrt{2146} \times 4 \times e^{i(\phi + \theta)} \). Wait, no, wait. No, actually, \( (75 + 117i) \) has magnitude 3*sqrt(2146), and angle \( \phi = \arctan(117/75) \). So, when we multiply by \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), the magnitude becomes \( 3\sqrt{2146} \times 4 = 12\sqrt{2146} \), and the angle becomes \( \phi + \theta \).

Okay, so the first term is \( 12\sqrt{2146} e^{i(\phi + \theta)} \).

Now, the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), \( 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\theta} \). So, \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Similarly, let's compute the magnitude and angle of \( 96 + 144i \). The magnitude is \( \sqrt{96^2 + 144^2} \). 96 squared is 9216, 144 squared is 20736. Adding them: 9216 + 20736 = 30000- wait, 9216 + 20736 is 30000 - 864? Wait, no, 9216 + 20736 = 29952. Hmm, sqrt(29952). Let me see: 29952 divided by 144 is 208. So, sqrt(29952) = sqrt(144*208) = 12*sqrt(208). Wait, 208 is 16*13, so sqrt(208) = 4*sqrt(13). So, sqrt(29952) = 12*4*sqrt(13) = 48sqrt(13). So, that's the magnitude of \( 96 + 144
