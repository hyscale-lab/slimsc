Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter to each face. Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, kind of like the 3D version of the inradius in a triangle.

First, let me list out the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetric. Maybe this tetrahedron has some special properties because of that symmetry?

I think in such a tetrahedron, it might be what's called an isosceles tetrahedron, where all opposite edges are equal. I remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the inradius can be calculated using a formula related to the volume and the surface area.

Wait, right! For any tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) is given by the formula:

r = 3V / S

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find V and S.

But how do I find V and S with the given edge lengths? Let me think. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe I can compute the volume using some formula specific to isosceles tetrahedrons.

I recall that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) )) / (something)... Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the tetrahedron as formed by two congruent triangles? Wait, no, because in this case, the edges AB, AC, BC are all different. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: maybe I can split the tetrahedron into two parts or place it in a coordinate system to calculate the coordinates of the vertices and then compute the volume and areas.

Yes, that might be a good approach. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.

Let me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Then, since AB = √41, let me place B at (x, 0, 0) such that the distance from A to B is √41. So, x = √41, so B is at (√41, 0, 0).

Now, where to place C? Let's say C is at (p, q, 0). Then, AC = √80, so the distance from A to C is √(p² + q²) = √80. So, p² + q² = 80.

Also, BC = √89. The distance from B to C is √( (p - √41)² + q² ) = √89. So,

(p - √41)² + q² = 89.

But since p² + q² = 80, we can subtract these equations:

(p - √41)² + q² - (p² + q²) = 89 - 80 => -2p√41 + 41 = 9 => -2p√41 = -32 => p = (32)/(2√41) = 16/√41.

So, p = 16/√41. Then, since p² + q² =80,

(256)/(41) + q² =80 => q² =80 - (256/41) = (80*41 -256)/41 = (3280 -256)/41 = 3024/41.

So, q = sqrt(3024/41) = (sqrt(3024))/sqrt(41). Let me compute sqrt(3024). 3024 = 16*189 = 16*9*21 = 16*9*3*7. So sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12√21. Therefore, q=12√21 /√41.

So, coordinates of C are (16/√41, 12√21/√41, 0).

Now, where to place D? Since AD = √89, let me assume D is at (r, s, t). Then, the distance from A to D is sqrt(r² + s² + t²) = √89, so r² + s² + t²=89.

Similarly, since BD = √80, the distance from B to D is sqrt( (r - √41)^2 + s² + t² )=√80. So,

(r - √41)^2 + s² + t²=80.

And CD = √41, so the distance between C and D is sqrt( (r - 16/√41)^2 + (s - 12√21/√41)^2 + t² )=√41.

So, that's a lot of equations. Let's list them:

1. r² + s² + t² =89.

2. (r - √41)^2 + s² + t²=80.

3. (r - 16/√41)^2 + (s - 12√21/√41)^2 + t²=41.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[r² + s² + t²] - [(r - √41)^2 + s² + t²] =89 -80 => r² - (r² - 2r√41 +41) =9 => 2r√41 -41=9 => 2r√41=50 => r=50/(2√41)=25/√41.

So, r=25/√41.

Now, plug r=25/√41 into equation 1:

(25/√41)^2 + s² + t²=89 => (625/41) + s² + t²=89 => s² + t²=89 -625/41 = (89*41 -625)/41.

Compute 89*41: 89*40=3560, 89*1=89, total 3560+89=3649. So,

s² + t²=(3649 -625)/41=(3024)/41.

So, s² + t²=3024/41.

Wait, interesting, because earlier, for point C, q² was also 3024/41. Hmm, is there a relation?

Now, let's go to equation 3:

(r -16/√41)^2 + (s -12√21/√41)^2 + t²=41.

Compute (r -16/√41)^2: r=25/√41, so (25/√41 -16/√41)=9/√41, so (9/√41)^2=81/41.

Similarly, (s -12√21/√41)^2 = s² - (24√21/√41)s + (144*21)/41.

So, equation 3 becomes:

81/41 + [s² - (24√21/√41)s + 2990.4/41] + t² =41.

Wait, let me compute 144*21: 144*20=2880, 144*1=144, so 2880+144=3024. So, 3024/41.

So, equation 3:

81/41 + s² - (24√21/√41)s + 3024/41 + t² =41.

But from equation 1 and 2, we have s² + t²=3024/41. So, substituting that into equation 3:

81/41 + (3024/41) - (24√21/√41)s + 3024/41 =41.

Wait, wait, s² + t²=3024/41, which is the same as in equation 3, so:

81/41 + (s² + t²) - (24√21/√41)s + ... Hmm, wait, perhaps I should structure this better.

Equation 3:

81/41 + [s² - (24√21/√41)s + 3024/41] + t² =41.

But s² + t² =3024/41, so substituting:

81/41 + [3024/41 - (24√21/√41)s + 3024/41] =41.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the equation is:

81/41 + (s² - (24√21/√41)s + 3024/41) + t² =41.

But s² + t²=3024/41, so s² + t²=3024/41.

Then, substituting:

81/41 + (3024/41 - (24√21/√41)s) + 3024/41 =41.

Wait, no. Because the term s² - (24√21/√41)s + 3024/41 is part of the equation, but s² + t²=3024/41.

So, s² =3024/41 - t².

Wait, perhaps it's better to substitute s² + t² =3024/41 into equation 3.

Equation 3:

81/41 + [s² - (24√21/√41)s + 3024/41] + t² =41.

So, group s² + t²:

81/41 + (s² + t²) - (24√21/√41)s + 3024/41 =41.

But s² + t²=3024/41, so:

81/41 + 3024/41 - (24√21/√41)s + 3024/41 =41.

So, adding up the constants:

(81 + 3024 + 3024)/41 - (24√21/√41)s =41.

Compute numerator: 81 + 3024=3105, then +3024=6129.

So, 6129/41 - (24√21/√41)s=41.

Compute 6129 ÷41: 41*149= 41*(150-1)=6150-41=6109. So, 6129-6109=20. So, 6129/41=149 +20/41=149 +20/41.

Wait, 41*149=6109, so 6129-6109=20. So, 6129=41*149 +20, so 6129/41=149 +20/41=149.4878...

But let me just write it as a fraction: 6129/41= (41*149 +20)/41=149 +20/41.

So, equation becomes:

149 +20/41 - (24√21/√41)s =41.

Subtract 41 from both sides:

108 +20/41 - (24√21/√41)s=0.

So,

(24√21/√41)s =108 +20/41.

Multiply both sides by √41/(24√21):

s= [ (108 +20/41) * √41 ] / (24√21 )

Compute numerator:

108*√41 + (20/41)*√41 =108√41 + (20√41)/41.

Factor out √41:

√41*(108 + 20/41) =√41*( (108*41 +20)/41 )=√41*(4428 +20)/41=√41*(4448/41).

So, numerator is √41 *4448/41.

Denominator is 24√21.

So, s= [ √41 *4448/41 ] / (24√21 )= (4448 / (41*24)) * (√41 / √21).

Simplify 4448/(41*24):

4448 ÷41: 41*108=4428, 4448-4428=20, so 108 +20/41.

Wait, 4448=41*108 +20.

So, 4448/(41*24)= [41*108 +20]/(41*24)= (108 +20/41)/24= (108/24) + (20)/(41*24)=4.5 + (5)/(41*6)=4.5 +5/246.

But maybe it's better to keep it as 4448/(41*24) for now.

So, s= [4448/(41*24)] * [√(41/21)].

Simplify √(41/21)=√(41)/√21.

So, s= [4448/(41*24)] * [√41 / √21 ].

Simplify 4448/41: Let's compute 41*108=4428, 4448-4428=20, so 4448=41*108 +20. So, 4448/41=108 +20/41=108.4878...

But perhaps 4448=16*278.

Wait, 278 divided by 2 is 139, which is a prime. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, note that 4448 =16*278, and 278=2*139. So, 4448=16*2*139=32*139.

Hmm, 139 is a prime. So, 4448=32*139.

Then, denominator is 41*24=41*24.

So, s= [32*139 / (41*24)] * [√41 / √21 ].

Simplify 32/24=4/3.

So, s= [4*139/(3*41)] * [√41 / √21 ].

Compute 4*139=556, and 3*41=123.

So, s= (556)/(123) * [√41 / √21 ].

Simplify 556/123: 123*4=492, 556-492=64, so 556=123*4 +64. So, 556/123=4 +64/123.

But maybe we can simplify the fraction: 556 and 123.

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(556,123). Let's compute GCD:

123 divides into 556 four times (4*123=492), remainder 64.

Then, GCD(123,64): 64 divides into 123 once, remainder 59.

GCD(64,59): 59 divides into 64 once, remainder 5.

GCD(59,5): 5 divides into 59 eleven times, remainder 4.

GCD(5,4): remainder 1.

GCD(4,1): remainder 0. So GCD is 1. So, the fraction 556/123 cannot be simplified.

So, s= (556/123) * [√41 / √21 ].

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps we can leave it as is for now.

So, s= (556√41)/(123√21).

Similarly, we can rationalize the denominator:

√41/√21 = √(41/21) = √(821/441) = (√821)/21. Wait, no, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, rationalize:

√41 / √21 = (√41 * √21)/21 = √(861)/21.

But 861 factors: 861 ÷3=287, which is 7*41. So, 861=3*7*41. So, √861=√(3*7*41). Not a perfect square, so it stays as √861.

So, s=556/(123) * √861 /21.

Wait, 556/(123*21)=556/(2583). Let's see, 556 and 2583.

Compute GCD(556,2583):

2583 ÷556=4, remainder 2583-4*556=2583-2224=359.

GCD(556,359): 359 into 556 once, remainder 556-359=197.

GCD(359,197): 197 into 359 once, remainder 162.

GCD(197,162): 162 into 197 once, remainder 35.

GCD(162,35):35 into 162 four times, remainder 162-140=22.

GCD(35,22):22 into 35 once, remainder 13.

GCD(22,13):13 into 22 once, remainder 9.

GCD(13,9):9 into 13 once, remainder 4.

GCD(9,4):4 into 9 twice, remainder 1.

GCD(4,1)=1.

So, GCD is 1. So, s=556√861/(2583).

Hmm, seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake earlier in the calculation.

Wait, let's double-check the equations. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, another approach: Given that all opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is symmetric, so maybe all faces are congruent? Or perhaps the areas of the faces can be computed in a symmetric way.

Wait, each face is a triangle. Let me compute the area of each face.

But for that, I can use Heron's formula. Let's compute the area of triangle ABC.

Given edges AB=√41, AC=√80, BC=√89.

Compute semi-perimeter: s=(√41 +√80 +√89)/2.

But Heron's formula might get messy here, but I can try.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the area using vectors or coordinates.

Wait, since I have coordinates for A, B, C, and D, maybe I can compute the areas of each face.

Wait, but I still don't have the coordinates for D. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps instead of computing the coordinates, I can use another formula for the volume.

Wait, in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V= sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c²) ) / 72 ?

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Yes! Cayley-Menger determinant could be the way to go. I think the formula is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC²  0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD²  0  |

So, the determinant is:

CM = determinant of the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1:1, 0, AB², AC², AD²
Row 2:1, AB², 0, BC², BD²
Row 3:1, AC², BC², 0, CD²
Row 4:1, AD², BD², CD², 0

Given AB=√41, so AB²=41
AC=√80, AC²=80
AD=√89, AD²=89
BC=√89, BC²=89
BD=√80, BD²=80
CD=√41, CD²=41

So, plug these into the matrix.

So,

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1:1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2:1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3:1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4:1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix.

This might be a bit tedious, but let's try.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for 4 points in 3D is:

CM = - determinant of the 5x5 matrix above.

The volume is sqrt(|CM| / 288).

Wait, actually, the formula is V² = |CM| / 288.

So, let's compute CM.

Let me denote the matrix as M.

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

We can compute the determinant using expansion by minors or other methods, but 5x5 is a bit big. Maybe we can perform row or column operations to simplify.

Alternatively, notice that the matrix has a lot of symmetry. Let's see:

Looking at rows 1,2,3,4, each has a similar structure.

Row 1:1, 0, 41,80,89
Row 2:1,41,0,89,80
Row 3:1,80,89,0,41
Row 4:1,89,80,41,0

Each row after the first has 1 followed by a permutation of (0,41,80,89). Wait, not exactly, because in row 1, it's (0,41,80,89), row 2 is (41,0,89,80), row3 is (80,89,0,41), row4 is (89,80,41,0). So, each row is a cyclic permutation of the previous.

Hmm, perhaps we can exploit this symmetry.

Alternatively, let's subtract row 1 from rows 2,3,4.

So, new rows:

Row 2: Row2 - Row1: [1-1,41-0,0-41,89-80,80-89] = [0,41,-41,9,-9]
Row3: Row3 - Row1: [1-1,80-0,89-41,0-80,41-89]= [0,80,48,-80,-48]
Row4: Row4 - Row1: [1-1,89-0,80-41,41-80,0-89]= [0,89,39,-39,-89]

So, the matrix becomes:

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1:1, 0, 41,80,89

Row2:0,41,-41,9,-9

Row3:0,80,48,-80,-48

Row4:0,89,39,-39,-89

Now, let's compute the determinant. Since the first column has 0,1,0,0,0, expanding along the first column might be better.

The determinant can be computed as:

0 * minor -1 * minor +0 -0 +0.

Wait, the determinant expansion along the first column:

The determinant is:

0 * minor_00
-1 * minor_10
+0 * minor_20
+0 * minor_30
+0 * minor_40

Wait, no, actually, the cofactor expansion along column 0.

The determinant is:

sum_{i=0 to 4} (-1)^{i+0} * M[i][0] * det(minor_i0)

But since M[0][0]=0, M[1][0]=1, others are 0.

So, determinant = (-1)^{1+0} * M[1][0] * det(minor_10)

= (-1)^1 * 1 * det(minor_10)

= -det(minor_10)

Where minor_10 is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0.

So, minor_10 is:

Rows 0,2,3,4 and columns 1,2,3,4.

So, the minor matrix is:

Row0:1,1,1,1

Row2:41,-41,9,-9

Row3:80,48,-80,-48

Row4:89,39,-39,-89

So, the minor matrix:

[
[1,1,1,1],
[41,-41,9,-9],
[80,48,-80,-48],
[89,39,-39,-89]
]

Compute determinant of this 4x4 matrix.

This is still a bit involved, but perhaps we can perform row operations.

Let me denote this matrix as N.

N = [
[1,1,1,1],
[41,-41,9,-9],
[80,48,-80,-48],
[89,39,-39,-89]
]

Let me try to subtract row 0 from rows 1,2,3.

Row1: Row1 - 41*Row0: [41-41*1, -41 -41*1, 9-41*1, -9-41*1] = [0, -82, -32, -50]

Row2: Row2 -80*Row0: [80-80*1,48 -80*1, -80 -80*1, -48 -80*1] = [0, -32, -160, -128]

Row3: Row3 -89*Row0: [89-89*1,39 -89*1, -39 -89*1, -89 -89*1] = [0, -50, -128, -178]

So, the new matrix N becomes:

Row0:1,1,1,1

Row1:0,-82,-32,-50

Row2:0,-32,-160,-128

Row3:0,-50,-128,-178

Now, the determinant of N is the same as the determinant of the original matrix, since we performed row operations that don't change the determinant.

Now, let's compute the determinant of this upper triangular matrix? Wait, no, it's just the first column is 1 followed by zeros, but rows 1-3 have zeros in the first column.

Actually, since the first column is [1,0,0,0]^T, the determinant can be computed by expanding along the first column.

The determinant is 1 * det of the minor matrix obtained by removing row0 and column0.

So, the minor matrix is:

[
[-82, -32, -50],
[-32, -160, -128],
[-50, -128, -178]
]

Compute determinant of this 3x3 matrix.

Let me denote this as matrix P:

P = [
[-82, -32, -50],
[-32, -160, -128],
[-50, -128, -178]
]

Compute det(P):

= -82 * det([[-160, -128], [-128, -178]]) - (-32)*det([[-32, -128], [-50, -178]]) + (-50)*det([[-32, -160], [-50, -128]])

Compute each 2x2 determinant:

First term: det([[-160, -128], [-128, -178]]) = (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128) = (28480) - (16384) = 28480 -16384 = 12096.

Second term: det([[-32, -128], [-50, -178]]) = (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50) = 5696 - 6400 = -704.

Third term: det([[-32, -160], [-50, -128]]) = (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50) = 4096 - 8000 = -3904.

So, putting it back:

det(P) = (-82)(12096) - (-32)(-704) + (-50)(-3904)

Compute each part:

First: -82 * 12096.

Compute 82 * 12096: 80*12096=967,680, 2*12096=24,192. So total 967,680 +24,192=991,872. So, -82*12096= -991,872.

Second: - (-32)*(-704)= - (32*704). 32*700=22,400; 32*4=128. So, 22,400 +128=22,528. So, -22,528.

Third: (-50)*(-3904)= 50*3904= 195,200.

So, det(P) = (-991,872) -22,528 +195,200.

Compute step by step:

-991,872 -22,528 = -1,014,400.

Then, -1,014,400 +195,200= -819,200.

So, det(P) = -819,200.

Therefore, the determinant of matrix N is 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200.

But earlier, the determinant of M (the original 5x5 matrix) was equal to - determinant of N, because determinant(M) = - det(N).

Wait, no, let's recap.

Earlier, determinant(M) = - det(minor_10), which is - det(N).

But det(N) was found to be -819,200, so determinant(M) = - (-819,200) = 819,200.

But wait, no. Wait:

The minor_10 is N, whose determinant is -819,200.

So, determinant(M) = - det(N) = - (-819,200) = 819,200.

Wait, but no, actually:

Wait, the original expansion was determinant(M) = - det(N), because the minor was of size 4x4 and the cofactor sign was (-1)^{1+0}= -1.

So, determinant(M) = - det(N) = - (-819,200) = 819,200.

So, the Cayley-Menger determinant is 819,200.

Then, the volume squared is |CM| /288, so V²= 819200 /288.

Compute 819200 ÷288.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 819200 /16=51200, 288/16=18.

So, 51200 /18= 25600 /9.

Thus, V²=25600/9, so V= sqrt(25600/9)=160/3.

So, the volume is 160/3.

Great, so V=160/3.

Now, I need to find the total surface area S.

Each face is a triangle. Since the tetrahedron is isosceles, I think all four faces are congruent? Wait, but checking the edge lengths: each face has edges like √41, √80, √89.

So, all faces are congruent triangles with sides √41, √80, √89.

So, all four faces have the same area. Therefore, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.

Compute area of triangle with sides a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

Use Heron's formula.

Compute semi-perimeter s= (√41 +√80 +√89)/2.

But Heron's formula is area= sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)].

But dealing with square roots is messy. Alternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps compute the area via vectors.

Wait, since I have coordinates for points A, B, C, I can compute the area of triangle ABC.

Compute vectors AB and AC.

Point A is at (0,0,0), B at (√41,0,0), C at (16/√41,12√21/√41,0).

Vectors AB = (√41, 0, 0).

Vector AC = (16/√41,12√21/√41,0).

Compute the cross product AB × AC.

AB × AC = determinant of the matrix:

i  j  k
√41 0 0
16/√41 12√21/√41 0

So, determinant is i*(0*0 -0*12√21/√41) - j*(√41*0 -0*16/√41) + k*(√41*12√21/√41 -0*16/√41 )

Simplify:

i*(0) - j*(0) + k*(12√21).

So, AB × AC = (0,0,12√21).

The magnitude of this vector is 12√21.

So, area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*|AB × AC|= (1/2)*12√21=6√21.

So, each face has area 6√21.

Therefore, total surface area S=4*6√21=24√21.

Wait, but hold on: each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

We calculated the area of ABC as 6√21. So, S=4*6√21=24√21.

So, surface area S=24√21.

Now, the inradius r=3V/S.

We have V=160/3, S=24√21.

So, r=3*(160/3)/(24√21)= (160)/(24√21)= (20)/(3√21).

Rationalizing the denominator:

r=20/(3√21) * (√21/√21)=20√21/(3*21)=20√21/(63).

So, r=20√21/63.

Simplify the fraction: 20 and 63 have GCD 1, so it's reduced.

So, the distance is 20√21/63.

Expressed as m√n/p, where m=20, n=21, p=63.

But check if n is square-free: 21 factors into 3*7, which are primes, so yes.

Check if m and p are coprime: 20 and 63, factors of 20 are 2,5; 63 is 7,3. So, yes, they are coprime.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Thus, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{104}


Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the distance from the incenter to each face. This distance can be written in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\), where \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers, \(m\) and \(p\) are relatively prime, and \(n\) is not divisible by the square of any prime. We then find \(m + n + p\).

First, we recognize that the tetrahedron is isosceles with equal opposite edges. We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \(V\). The Cayley-Menger determinant for the given edge lengths is computed as follows:

\[
\text{CM} = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

After performing row operations and simplifying, we find the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix to be 819200. The volume \(V\) is then calculated as:

\[
V = \sqrt{\frac{|\text{CM}|}{288}} = \sqrt{\frac{819200}{288}} = \frac{160}{3}
\]

Next, we compute the total surface area \(S\). Each face is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using the cross product method, we find the area of one face to be \(6\sqrt{21}\). Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area is:

\[
S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

The inradius \(r\) is given by the formula \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\):

\[
r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]

Thus, the distance from the incenter to each face is \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\). Expressing this as \(\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p}\), we have \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

\[
\boxed{104}
\]
