Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there exists a rotation such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, each vertex is colored red or blue, each with probability 1/2, independently. So, there are a total of 2^8 = 256 possible colorings.

The question is about the probability that there exists a rotation (i.e., a rotation by some multiple of 45 degrees) such that when we apply that rotation, all the blue vertices move to positions that were previously red.

Wait, so if I rotate the octagon by some angle, then each blue vertex moves to a new position. We want that new position to have been red originally. So, for each blue vertex in the original coloring, after rotation, it should land on a red vertex.

Alternatively, if I think about the coloring after rotation, all the blue vertices in the original coloring should map to red in the target coloring.

Wait, but the rotation is applied to the octagon, so we are effectively permuting the vertices. So, for the condition to hold, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices.

But wait, maybe not exactly. Let me clarify.

Suppose the original coloring has B blue vertices. After a rotation by k positions (k=0,1,...,7), the blue vertices move to k positions away. For the condition to hold, every blue vertex must land on a red vertex. So, the set of blue vertices must be exactly the image under rotation of the set of red vertices.

But since the octagon is regular, rotations correspond to cyclic permutations.

Wait, but the octagon has rotational symmetry, so the set of red vertices must be a rotation of the set of blue vertices. So, the set of blue vertices must be a cyclic shift of the set of red vertices.

But this can only happen if the number of blue vertices is equal to the number of red vertices, right? Because otherwise, the rotation would map blue to red, but you can't have a bijection if the numbers are different.

Wait, each vertex is colored red or blue independently. So, the number of blue vertices can vary from 0 to 8. But for a rotation to
