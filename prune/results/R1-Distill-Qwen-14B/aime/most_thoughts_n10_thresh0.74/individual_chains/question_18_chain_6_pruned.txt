Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon). Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there are symmetries that might help in counting things like rectangles. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, it's highly symmetrical, so maybe the number of rectangles can be determined by some combinatorial method.

I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 vertices, each connected by sides and diagonals. The problem says sides of the rectangle lie on sides or diagonals, but I'm not sure if that means the sides of the rectangle have to be edges of the dodecagon, or can they be diagonals as well? Wait, the problem says each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal, so the sides of the rectangle are edges (sides or diagonals) of the dodecagon.

So, each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. That means that the four vertices of the rectangle must be four vertices of the dodecagon such that the sides of the rectangle connect them via these edges.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, a rectangle would require that the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all angles are 90 degrees. So, the key is that the sides of the rectangle must meet at right angles.

In a regular dodecagon, the central angles between consecutive vertices are 30 degrees because 360/12 = 30. So, the angle subtended by each side at the center is 30 degrees.

Now, for a rectangle to be formed, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned in such a way that their adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, the idea is to find pairs of vertices such that the chords connecting them are perpendicular. But wait, chords in a circle can be perpendicular if the arcs between their endpoints add up to 180 degrees? Not sure. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can
