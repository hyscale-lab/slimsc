Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where I have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at point P. I need to find the length of AP, given that AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I'll try to visualize the problem or maybe sketch a rough diagram. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at point D. Since tangents from a common external point are equal, DB = DC. So, D lies on the symmedian or the isogonal conjugate of the median from A or something like that? Not sure yet.

Then, AD intersects the circumcircle again at P. So, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P, with D lying on AD. I need to find AP.

I remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, the power of a point can be useful. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² because DB = DC. Also, since D lies on the tangents at B and C, power of D is equal to DB² = DC² = (tangent length)^2.

Also, since AD intersects ω at A and P, by the power of point D with respect to ω, we have:

DB² = DA * DP

Because the power of D is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the points of intersection with the circle along a line. So, DA * DP = DB².

So, if I can find DB, then I can write DA * DP = DB². Then, AP = DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, AP is the length from A to P. Since P is on the circumcircle, and A is also on it, AP is the chord length. But D is outside the circle, so AD is a secant. So, the power of D is DB² = DA * DP. So, DP = DB² / DA.

But wait, AP is actually equal to DP - DA? Hmm, no. Because AP is the segment from A to P, and AD is from A to D, but D is outside the circle. So, AD is longer than AP. Wait, no, actually, if A is inside the circle and D is outside, then AD would pass through the circle at A and P, so AP is the part from A to P, and DP is from D to P. So, the length AP would be equal to DP minus DA? Wait, no, because D is outside, and AD is a secant. Let me think.

Wait, if AD is a secant from D passing through A and then through P, then the power of point D is equal to DB² = DA * DP. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DP is DA + AP? Wait, no, because if you have point D outside the circle, and AD is the secant, then AP would be the part from A to P, so DP would be DA + AP. Wait, no, because if you go from D to A, that's DA, and then from A to P, that's AP, so DP is DA + AP. So, the power of D is DB² = DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP).

Wait, but in the problem, we need to find AP. So, if I can find DB, DA, then I can solve for AP.

So, DB² = DA * (DA + AP)

But I need to find DA and DB.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Menelaus' theorem or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe coordinate geometry
