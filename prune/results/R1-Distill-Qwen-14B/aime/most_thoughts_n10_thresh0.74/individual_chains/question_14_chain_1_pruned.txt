Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. 

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what N is. Since it's a four-digit number, it's between 9999 and 1000. But we want the greatest such number, so I'll probably start checking from 9999 downwards.

The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is abcd, then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives abc1. All of these should be divisible by 7.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can model N as a four-digit number with digits A, B, C, D. So N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change any digit to 1, we get a new number. Let's see:

1. Changing A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Also divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Divisible by 7.

So each of these four numbers must be congruent to 0 modulo 7. That gives us four congruence equations.

Let me write these equations out:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm. Maybe I can express each of these in terms of N. Let me think.

Wait, N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, for each case, changing a digit to 1 affects a part of N. Let's see:

Case 1: Changing A to 1: 1000 + ... = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So this is (N - (A*1000)) + 1000.

Similarly:

Case 1: (N - 1000A) + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
Case 2: (N - 100B) + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7
Case 3: (N - 10C) + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7
Case 4: (N - D) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each case is N minus the original digit times its place, plus 1 times that place. So, each is N - (digit)*place + 1*place = N - (digit -1)*place.

Wait, perhaps not the most helpful. Maybe it's better to think in terms of N and how changing each digit affects N modulo 7.

Alternatively, let me compute N modulo 7 and the changes in terms of modulo 7.

Let me denote N as:

N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Each of the four modified numbers:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A - 10C - D + 10C + D) ??? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute each modified number modulo 7 and set it to 0.

Compute each case:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me compute each term modulo 7.

First, 1000 mod 7. 7*142 = 994, so 1000 -994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3.

1 mod7=1.

So:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7
2. (6A) + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡0 mod7

So these four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 --> (2B + 3C + D) ≡1 mod7 (since 6 ≡-1)
2. 6A + 3C + D + 2 ≡0 mod7 --> (6A + 3C + D) ≡5 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + D +3 ≡0 mod7 --> (6A + 2B + D) ≡4 mod7
4. 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7 --> (6A + 2B +3C) ≡6 mod7

So now we have four congruences:

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7
Equation (2): 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7
Equation (3): 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7
Equation (4): 6A + 2B +3C ≡6 mod7

Hmm, this is a system of linear congruences. Maybe I can solve them step by step.

Let me denote the equations as (1), (2), (3), (4) for ease.

First, from equation (1): 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7 --> Let's call this Eq1.

From equation (2):6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7 --> Eq2.

From equation (3):6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7 --> Eq3.

From equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 --> Eq4.

I can try to express these equations in terms of variables and solve.

Let me see how to eliminate variables.

First, subtract Eq1 from Eq2:

Eq2 - Eq1: (6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) = 6A -2B =5 -1=4 mod7.

So 6A - 2B ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

So 3A - B ≡2 mod7 --> Let's call this Eq5.

Similarly, subtract Eq3 from Eq2:

Eq2 - Eq3: (6A +3C + D) - (6A +2B + D) =3C -2B =5 -4=1 mod7.

So 3C -2B ≡1 mod7 --> Eq6.

Also, from Eq4: 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, maybe we can express 6A in terms of B from Eq5.

From Eq5: 3A ≡ B +2 mod7. Multiply both sides by 2: 6A ≡2B +4 mod7.

So 6A = 2B +4 mod7.

Then substitute 6A in Eq4:

(2B +4) +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Combine like terms:4B +3C +4 ≡6 mod7.

So 4B +3C ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Eq7.

From Eq6:3C ≡2B +1 mod7.

Let me write that:

3C =2B +1 mod7 --> Eq6.

So now, from Eq7:4B +3C ≡2.

But 3C=2B +1, so substitute into Eq7:

4B + (2B +1) ≡2 mod7.

So 6B +1 ≡2 mod7.

Subtract 1:6B ≡1 mod7.

6B ≡1 mod7.

Multiplicative inverse of 6 mod7 is 6, since 6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So B ≡6*1≡6 mod7.

So B=6 mod7. Since B is a digit (0-9), B can be 6 or 13, but 13 is not a digit, so B=6.

So B=6.

Now, from Eq5:3A - B ≡2 mod7.

B=6, so 3A -6 ≡2 mod7.

3A ≡8 mod7. 8 mod7=1. So 3A ≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 5.

Thus, A ≡5*1≡5 mod7.

So A=5 or 12, but since A is a digit (1-9), A=5.

So A=5.

Now, from Eq6:3C=2B +1 mod7.

B=6, so 2*6=12≡5 mod7. So 3C=5 +1=6 mod7.

So 3C≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7, which is 5.

C≡6*5=30≡2 mod7.

So C=2 or 9, since C is a digit (0-9). So C=2 or 9.

Now, let's go back to Eq1:2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

B=6, so 2*6=12≡5 mod7.

So 5 +3C +D ≡1 mod7.

Thus, 3C + D ≡-4≡3 mod7.

So 3C + D ≡3 mod7.

Now, from C being 2 or 9.

Case 1: C=2.

Then 3*2=6.

So 6 + D ≡3 mod7.

So D≡3 -6 ≡-3≡4 mod7.

So D=4 or 11, but since D is a digit (0-9), D=4.

Case 2: C=9.

3*9=27≡6 mod7.

So 6 + D ≡3 mod7.

Thus, D≡3 -6≡-3≡4 mod7.

So D=4 or 11, again, D=4.

So whether C=2 or 9, D=4.

Wait, that's interesting. So D=4 in both cases.

So now, let me summarize:

A=5, B=6, C=2 or9, D=4.

So N is 5 6 C 4, where C is either 2 or 9.

So N can be 5624 or 5694.

But we need the greatest four-digit number, so 5694 is larger than 5624.

Wait, but let me check if these numbers satisfy all four conditions.

So let's take N=5694.

Check each case:

1. Change A to 1: 1694. Is 1694 divisible by7?

1694 ÷7=242, since 7*240=1680, 1694-1680=14, which is 7*2. So 242. So yes, divisible by7.

2. Change B to 1: 5194. Is 5194 divisible by7?

Compute 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. 7*700=4900, 7*42=294; 4900+294=5194. Yes.

3. Change C to1: 5614. Is 5614 divisible by7?

Compute 5614 ÷7: 7*800=5600, 5614-5600=14. 14/7=2. So 802. Yes.

4. Change D to1: 5691. Is 5691 divisible by7?

Compute 5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. 7*800=5600, 7*13=91; 5600+91=5691. Yes.

So all four cases work for N=5694.

Now, check N=5624.

1. Change A to1:1624. 1624 ÷7=232, as 7*230=1610, 1624-1610=14, which is 7*2. So 232. Yes.

2. Change B to1:5124
