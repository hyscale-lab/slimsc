Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand this step by step. So, Alice picks some set A. Then Bob considers all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to figure out what set A could be such that this condition holds, and then sum the elements of A.

First, I should think about what defines a set B in Bob's list. Each B is a finite non-empty set of positive integers, and the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, how many sets B have a as their maximum element?

If I fix a particular a in A, then any set B with maximum a must consist of a and any subset of the positive integers less than a. Wait, no, not exactly any subset. Because B is a set of positive integers, and the maximum is a. So for each a, the number of such sets B is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, since each such subset can be combined with a to form a set B with maximum a.

But wait, each B is a finite non-empty set, so for each a, the number of B's with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Because the subsets of {1,2,...,a-1} can be any size, including the empty set. But wait, if we include the empty set, then together with a, we get {a}, which is a valid non-empty set. So yes, for each a, the number of B's with maximum a is 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets in Bob's list is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

So, if I denote A as {a1, a2, ..., an}, then the total number of sets is 2^{a1 -1} + 2^{a2 -1} + ... + 2^{an -1} }.

And this sum is given as 2024.

So, 2^{a1 -1}
