Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me read it again carefully.

The hexagon is named ABCDEF, and it's convex and equilateral. That means all its sides are equal in length. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Interesting. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. That structure probably makes it a special kind of hexagon, maybe related to a parallelogram but with six sides.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of this triangle's sides are given as 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm. Let me visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Since the hexagon is convex and all opposite sides are parallel, the extensions must meet in a way that creates a triangle outside the hexagon.

I think I can model this using coordinate geometry or vectors, but maybe there's a more straightforward approach using similar triangles or proportions.

Wait, in such a hexagon, the opposite sides being parallel suggests that the hexagon can be thought of as a combination of three parallelograms, each formed by a pair of opposite sides. But since it's equilateral, each pair has the same side length.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon can be inscribed in a larger triangle, where each side of the hexagon is a part of the edges of that triangle. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is that larger triangle.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since each pair of opposite sides are parallel and equal, the hexagon might be similar to a scaled-down version of the larger triangle.

Wait, if I imagine extending AB, CD, and EF, the points where these extensions meet form the triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. So, each side of this triangle is formed by the extension of one side of the hexagon.

In the hexagon, each side is part of the sides of this larger triangle, but since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, the extensions must be proportional.

I think the key here is to use the concept of similar triangles. Each side of the hexagon is part of the larger triangle, and the remaining part of each side of the larger triangle is the extension beyond the hexagon.

Let me denote the sides:

- The larger triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300.

- The hexagon has sides of length 's'.

Suppose that for each side of the larger triangle, the hexagon contributes a segment of length 's', and the remaining length is the extension beyond the hexagon.

But wait, since the sides of the triangle are formed by extending the sides of the hexagon, each side of the triangle is composed of two extensions from the hexagon.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Each side of the larger triangle is formed by extending only one side of the hexagon. For example, side AB is extended to form part of the triangle's side, and similarly for CD and EF.

But in that case, each side of the triangle would be equal to the side of
