Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. They tell us that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. I know that the circumradius R is 13, so the distance from the circumcenter O to any vertex (like A, B, or C) is 13. The inradius r is 6, so the distance from the incenter I to each side is 6.

They also mention that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. That must mean that triangle IOA has a right angle at I because IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, no. Actually, IA is the line from I to A, and OI is the line from O to I. So, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees.

Wait, no. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, in triangle IOA, the angle at I is 90 degrees.

So, in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = IO² + IA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13, so OA = 13. So, 13² = IO² + IA². That's 169 = IO² + IA².

I also know that the inradius is 6, so IA is equal to the inradius? Wait, no. IA is the distance from incenter I to vertex A, which is not the same as the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, like BC, AC, or AB.

Wait, so IA is the length from I to A, which is a different measurement. Hmm. I think I can express IA in terms of other triangle properties.
