Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem involving a lottery. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize, and B is the event of winning any prize. However, since winning the grand prize necessarily means she has at least two correct numbers, A is a subset of B. So, A ∩ B is just A. Therefore, the formula simplifies to P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: P(A) and P(B).

First, let's figure out how many possible ways there are to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = 210. So, the total number of possible lottery outcomes is 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she picks 4 numbers, and the lottery also picks 4, there's only one way this can happen. So, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that Jen wins at least two numbers. This means she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers. But wait, since the grand prize is 4 correct, which we've already considered, to find B, we need to count all cases where she has 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers.

But wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, that includes exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 correct numbers. So, B is the union of these three events: exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 correct.

So, to compute P(B), I need to calculate the number of ways she can have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 correct numbers, sum those up, and then divide by the total number of possible outcomes (210).

Let's break it down:

1. Exactly 4 correct: This is the same as event A, so the number of ways is 1.

2. Exactly 3 correct: How many ways can this happen? Jen has 4 numbers. The lottery also has 4 numbers. To have exactly 3 correct, Jen must have 3 of her 4 numbers matching the lottery's 4, and the remaining 1 number must not match.

So, to compute this, it's the number of ways to choose 3 correct numbers from her 4, and 1 incorrect number from the remaining 6 numbers (since there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not in her set). So, the count is C(4,3) * C(6,1). C(4,3) is 4, and C(6,1) is 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.

3. Exactly 2 correct: Similarly, Jen has 4 numbers, and the lottery has 4. For exactly 2 correct, she must have 2 correct and 2 incorrect.

The count is C(4,2) * C(6,2). C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. The lottery has 4 numbers, and Jen has 4. So, for exactly 2 correct, she picks 2 from her 4, and 2 from the remaining 6. So, yeah, that should be 6 * 15 = 90.

So, adding up all the favorable cases for B: exactly 4 is 1, exactly 3 is 24, exactly 2 is 90. So, total is 1 + 2
