Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, and they have a total length of 16. The catch is that these paths have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right normally means moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you need to make 8 moves to the right and 8 moves up, totaling 16 moves. So, the number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time for either direction, which is C(16,8). But here, we have a restriction on the number of direction changes.

What's a direction change? Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, if a path starts by moving right, the first direction change would be when it switches to up, and so on.

Wait, the problem says exactly four direction changes. So, how does that translate into the structure of the path?

Let me think. If a path has four direction changes, that means it alternates direction four times. Let's break it down. Suppose the path starts by moving right. Then, after some number of right moves, it changes to up, which is the first direction change. Then it continues moving up until it changes direction again to right, that's the second direction change. This would continue until it has four direction changes in total.

But wait, how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of segments or straight lines in the path? Each direction change would split the path into a new segment. So, starting direction, say right, then each change adds a new segment. So, four direction changes would mean five segments in total. Because each change adds a segment.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If you have a path with two direction changes, you have three segments. Yeah, because each change adds a new segment. So, four direction changes would mean five segments. So, the path is made up of five straight segments, alternating between right and up.

So, the path alternates between moving right and up, starting with either right or up. Since the grid is square (8x8), the number of right and up moves must each
