Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient Q and the remainder R. Finally, I need to give that sum as the answer.

Alright, let's break it down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with the given property. So I should probably start from 9999 and work my way down until I find a number that satisfies the condition.

The condition is that if any single digit is changed to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 should yield a number divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD (where A, B, C, D are its digits), then replacing A with 1 gives 1BCD, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, replacing C with 1 gives AB1D, and replacing D with 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Hmm, that seems like a lot of divisibility conditions. I need to ensure that all four modified numbers are divisible by 7. That probably means there are some constraints on the original digits A, B, C, D.

Wait, but N itself doesn't have to be divisible by 7 necessarily, right? Because the problem only states that changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. So N could be any number, but when you change any one digit to 1, it must be a multiple of 7.

I think the key here is to find N such that when each digit is individually replaced by 1, the number is a multiple of 7. So, for each digit position, changing that digit to 1 gives a multiple of 7. So, maybe for each digit, the number formed by the other three digits plus 1 in that position is congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let me formalize that a bit. Let's say N is a four-digit number, so N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is at least 1 since it's a four-digit number.

Now, when we replace each digit with 1, we get four new numbers:

1. Replace a with 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This number must be divisible by 7.

2. Replace b with 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

3. Replace c with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. This must be divisible by 7.

4. Replace d with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. This must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be ≡0 mod 7. So, we can write four congruence relations.

Let me denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Then, the four modified numbers are:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡0 mod7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡0 mod7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡0 mod7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡0 mod7

So, I can write each of these congruences in terms of N or its digits. Maybe it's better to express them in terms of a, b, c, d.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each condition as a congruence modulo 7, and then solve for the digits a, b, c, d.

Let me compute the value of each modified number mod7.

First, compute 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 mod7 is 6.

100 divided by 7: 14*7=98, so 100 mod7 is 2.

10 mod7 is 3.

So, 1000 ≡6 mod7, 100≡2 mod7, 10≡3 mod7.

Now, let's compute each modified number mod7.

1. 1000 + 100b +10c +d ≡6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

2. 1000a +100 +10c +d ≡6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

3. 1000a +100b +10 +d ≡6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

4. 1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, now we have four equations:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡-6 mod7 → 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1).

2. 6a +3c +d ≡-2 mod7 → 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

3. 6a +2b +d ≡-3 mod7 → 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

4. 6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7 → 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. (Equation 1)

2. 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7. (Equation 2)

3. 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7. (Equation 3)

4. 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. (Equation 4)

Our variables are a, b, c, d, each a digit from 0 to 9, with a ≥1.

Our goal is to find the maximum four-digit number N = 1000a + 100b +10c +d. So, to maximize N, we want the largest possible a, then b, then c, then d.

Therefore, we should start checking from a=9, then b=9, c=9, d=9, but of course, they must satisfy the four congruence conditions above.

But, since it's a four-digit number, a must be at least 1, but to maximize N, a should be as large as possible, which is 9.

So, let's start with a=9 and see if we can find suitable b, c, d.

Plugging a=9 into Equation 2: 6*9 +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

6*9=54. 54 mod7: 7*7=49, so 54-49=5. So, 5 + 3c +d ≡5 mod7 → 3c +d ≡0 mod7. (Equation 2a)

Similarly, plug a=9 into Equation 3: 6*9 +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

6*9=54, which mod7 is 5. So, 5 +2b +d ≡4 mod7 → 2b +d ≡-1 mod7 → 2b +d ≡6 mod7. (Equation 3a)

Plug a=9 into Equation 4: 6*9 +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

6*9=54 mod7 is 5. So, 5 +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 → 2b +3c ≡1 mod7. (Equation 4a)

So, now, with a=9, we have:

Equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation 2a: 3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation 3a: 2b +d ≡6 mod7.

Equation 4a: 2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

Our variables are b, c, d, digits from 0 to 9.

We can try to solve these equations step by step.

First, from Equation 4a: 2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

From Equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. But 2b +3c ≡1 mod7, so substituting, 1 +d ≡1 mod7 → d ≡0 mod7. So, d must be 0 or 7.

Similarly, from Equation 2a: 3c +d ≡0 mod7.

If d≡0 mod7, then d can be 0 or7.

Case 1: d=0.

Then, Equation 2a: 3c ≡0 mod7 → 3c ≡0 mod7. Since 3 and 7 are coprime, c must be ≡0 mod7. So c=0 or7.

Also, Equation 3a: 2b +0 ≡6 mod7 → 2b ≡6 mod7 → b ≡3 mod7 (since 2*3=6). So b can be 3 or 10, but since b is a digit, b=3.

From Equation 4a: 2b +3c ≡1 mod7. With b=3, it becomes 6 +3c ≡1 mod7 → 3c ≡-5 mod7 → 3c≡2 mod7. Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7, which is 5 since 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So c≡2*5=10≡3 mod7. So c=3 or 10, but c is a digit, so c=3.

So, in Case 1, d=0, c=3, b=3.

Check Equation 1: 2b +3c +d = 2*3 +3*3 +0 =6 +9 +0=15. 15 mod7 is 1, which matches Equation 1. So this is valid.

So, with a=9, b=3, c=3, d=0, N=9330.

But wait, we want the maximum four-digit number. 9330 is a candidate, but perhaps we can find a larger one with a=9 but higher b, c, d.

Wait, but in this case, b=3, which is lower than 9, so if we can find a higher b, maybe with d=7, we could have a higher N.

So let's check Case 2: d=7.

Then, Equation 2a: 3c +7 ≡0 mod7 → 3c ≡-7 mod7 → 3c≡0 mod7. So,
