Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay, let me break this down and think through it step by step.

First, I know that any complex number \( z \) can be expressed in polar form. Since the magnitude of \( z \) is 4, I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That seems like a good start because working with exponentials might make it easier to handle the division and multiplication of complex numbers.

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let me rewrite the entire expression:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplify each term separately. Let's compute each part:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \)

Let me factor out the 4: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}.

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \)

That's the same as (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} because 1/(e^{iθ}) is e^{-iθ}.

So, let's compute the constants:

First term's constant: 4*(75 + 117i) = 4*75 + 4*117i = 300 + 468i.

Second term's constant: (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i.

So now, the expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, this looks manageable. Now, I can write each term using Euler's formula. Remember, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's expand both terms.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so this becomes 24 cosθ + ( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i + 36 sinθ.

Now, let's combine the real and imaginary parts from both terms.

Real parts:

First term real: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Second term real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Total real part: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

First term imaginary: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Second term imaginary: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ.

Total imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So, putting it all together, the expression simplifies to:

Real part: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary part: 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But since the question is about the real part, I can focus just on the real part: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the real part is a linear combination of cosθ and sinθ. I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.

Right, so the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me compute the amplitude here.

The amplitude C is sqrt(A^2 + B^2) where A = 324 and B = -432.

So, C = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ).

Let me compute that. First, 324 squared: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and cross term is 2*300*24=14,400. So (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 976? Wait, 90,000 +14,400 is 104,400 + 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So (400+32)^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624.

So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

Wait, sqrt(291,600). Let me see: 500^2 is 250,000. 540^2 is 291,600 because 54^2 is 2916, so 540^2 is 291,600. So C is 540.

So, the real part can be written as 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is the phase angle. Wait, but the maximum value of cos is 1, so the maximum real part is 540. Is that right? Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. When we express this as R cos(θ + φ), R will be sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Let me compute that again.

324^2 is 104,976 and 432^2 is 186,624. Sum is 291,600, sqrt is 540. Yes, that's correct. So the maximum value is 540, so the largest possible real part is 540.

But wait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of the real part earlier. Let me go back.

Original expression after substitution:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, and |z|=4.

So z = 4 e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

So the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i) *4 e^{iθ} + (96 +144i)*(1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Which is 4*(75 +117i) e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

Which is 300 +468i multiplied by e^{iθ} plus 24 +36i multiplied by e^{-iθ}.

Then I expanded each term:

First term: 300 cosθ + 468 cosθ i + 300 i sinθ + 468 i^2 sinθ.

Which becomes 300 cosθ + (468 cosθ + 300 sinθ)i -468 sinθ.

Similarly, second term: 24 cosθ + 36 cosθ i -24 sinθ i -36 i^2 sinθ.

Which becomes 24 cosθ + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i +36 sinθ.

Then combining the real parts:

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ =324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

That's correct. So real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So the maximum value is 540, as I found earlier.

Wait, but I should confirm that the expression is indeed 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which can be written as 540 cos(θ + φ), and the maximum real part is 540.

So the answer should be 540.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in calculations.

Wait, 324 and 432. Let me see: 324 is 81*4, 432 is 81*5.333. Wait, maybe they have a common factor.

Wait, 324 / 81 = 4, 432 /81=5.333? Wait, maybe another common factor. Let me see, 324 and 432.

Divide both by 81: 324 ÷81=4, 432 ÷81=5.333... Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, 324 and 432 are both divisible by 12: 324 ÷12=27, 432
