Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z], where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for any complex number z with |z| = r, it can be written as z = r * e^{iθ} where θ is the argument of z. Since |z| is given as 4, z can be expressed as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is some real number between 0 and 2π. That might simplify things because expressing z in polar form often helps with complex number operations.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|². So, 1/z = (1/(4)) e^{-iθ} because |z| is 4.

Now, substituting z into the expression: (75 + 117i)z becomes (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}, and (96 + 144i)/z becomes (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Let me factor out the 4: 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

So, the first term is (300 + 468i) * e^{iθ}.

Similarly, the second part: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) = 24 + 36i.

So, the second term is (24 + 36i) * e^{-iθ}.

So, now the entire expression becomes:
(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

I need to find the real part of this expression, and then maximize it with respect to θ.

To find the real part, I can express each term in terms of cosine and sine. Let's recall that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's compute each multiplication:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Multiply this out:
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ.

But i² is -1, so:
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ.

So, separating real and imaginary parts:
Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.
Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiply this out:
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ.

Again, i² = -1, so:
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Separating real and imaginary parts:
Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.
Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i.

Now, adding both terms together (the first term and the second term):

The total real part is [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ].

The total imaginary part is [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ] + [-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ], but since we're only interested in the real part, let's focus on that.

So, combining the real parts:

300 cosθ + 24 cosθ = 324 cosθ.

-468 sinθ + 36 sinθ = (-468 + 36) sinθ = (-432) sinθ.

So, the real part of the entire expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, our goal is to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ as θ varies from 0 to 2π.

I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value is then C.

So, let me compute C, which is sqrt(A² + B²).

Wait, but in this case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, A = 324, B = -432.

So, the amplitude C is sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Let me compute that.

First, 324 squared: 324 * 324.

Hmm, 300² = 90000, 24² = 576, and cross terms 2*300*24 = 14400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 432^2. Let me compute 400² = 160,000, 32²=1024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600 + 1,024 is 186,624.

But since it's (-432)^2, it's the same as 432^2, which is 186,624.

So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Let me compute sqrt(291,600).

Hmm, 500² is 250,000, 540² is 291,600 because 54² is 2916, so 540² is 291600. So, C=540.

So, the expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ can be rewritten as 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is some angle. The maximum value of this is 540, since the maximum of cos is 1.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the signs or coefficients.

Wait, let's check the calculation again.

We had expression Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, to write this as C cos(θ + φ), where φ is an angle such that cosφ = A/C and sinφ = B/C, where A is 324 and B is -432.

So, cosφ = 324 / C, sinφ = (-432)/C.

So, C is sqrt(324² + 432²) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540, which is correct.

So, the maximum value is indeed 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps.

We started with the given expression, expressed z in polar form, substituted, expanded, combined real parts, then recognized the expression as a linear combination of sine and cosine, converted it into amplitude form, calculated the amplitude, and that's the maximum real part. Seems solid.

So, the final answer is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Simplifying each term:
\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Expanding these using Euler's formula:
\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta),
\]
\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta).
\]
Combining the real parts:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]
This expression can be rewritten as \(C\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(C = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540\). The maximum value of this expression is \(540\).

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
