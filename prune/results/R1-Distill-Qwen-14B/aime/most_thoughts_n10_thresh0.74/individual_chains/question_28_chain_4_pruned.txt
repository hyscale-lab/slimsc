Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in such a way that opposite edges are equal: AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. The lengths are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), and sqrt(89) respectively. The question is about finding the distance from a special point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point I is such that all its distances to the four faces are equal. I remember that in a tetrahedron, this point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance is given in a specific form, and I need to find m + n + p where the distance is m√n / p, with certain conditions on m, n, p.

First, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron because I think the formula for the inradius involves the volume and the surface area. The formula, as I recall, is similar to the 2D case: inradius r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. Wait, no, in 3D, it's r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. Let me confirm: in a tetrahedron, the inradius is equal to 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. So I need to compute the volume and the surface area.

But wait, calculating the volume of a tetrahedron when all edges are given is tricky. I remember that for a general tetrahedron, the volume can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The formula is V² = (1/288) times the determinant of a matrix constructed from the edge lengths. Let me recall the exact formula.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:

CM = | 0  1    1    1    1  |
     | 1  0  AB² AC² AD² |
     | 1 AB² 0  BC² BD² |
     | 1 AC² BC² 0  CD² |
     | 1 AD² BD² CD²  0  |

The volume is then sqrt( CM / 288 ). Wait, but I need to compute the determinant correctly.

So in this problem, AB = CD = sqrt(41), so AB² = 41, CD² = 41.

AC = BD = sqrt(80), so AC² = 80, BD² = 80.

BC = AD = sqrt(89), so BC² = 89, AD² = 89.

So the edges are:

AB² = 41

AC² = 80

AD² = 89

BC² = 89

BD² = 80

CD² = 41

So plugging into the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix:
