Alright, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. If all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize. The question is about the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability can be expressed as m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Okay, so probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down. It's a conditional probability problem, so I think I can use Bayes' theorem here. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A โฉ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers correct, which is a subset of winning a prize (because winning the grand prize requires at least two correct numbers), the intersection of A and B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two things: the probability of Jen winning the grand prize (P(A)) and the probability of her winning any prize (P(B)). Then, divide P(A) by P(B) to get the conditional probability.

First, let's figure out how many possible ways there are to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which is denoted as C(10,4). Let me calculate that. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)! ). So, C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that can be chosen. Since Jen picks one specific set, the probability of her winning the grand prize is 1/210 because only one combination will match her numbers exactly. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that Jen wins at least two numbers, meaning she has either exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers matching the drawn numbers. So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of these three events: exactly two matches, exactly three matches, and exactly four matches.

Let me denote the number of ways to choose exactly k matching numbers as C(10,4) with exactly k matches. Wait, actually, to compute these probabilities, I can think in terms of hypergeometric distribution, where we're sampling without replacement.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute the number of favorable outcomes for each case (exactly 2, 3, 4 matches) and then divide each by the total number of possible outcomes (210) to get each probability, then add them up for P(B).

So, let's compute the number of favorable outcomes for exactly 2 matches. How do we calculate that? Well, we need exactly two numbers matching Jen's numbers and the other two not matching. So, Jen has 4 numbers. The number of ways to choose exactly two of them is C(4,2). Then, for the remaining two numbers, we need to choose them from the numbers not in Jen's set. Since the total set S has 10 numbers, and Jen picked 4, there are 6 numbers not in her set. So, we choose the remaining two numbers from these 6, which is C(6,2). So, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly two matches is C(4,2) * C(6,2).

Similarly, for exactly three matches: we choose 3 numbers from Jen's 4, which is C(4,3), and 1 number from the remaining 6, which is C(6,1). So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,3)*C(6,1).

For exactly four matches, it's just C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1, which is just the grand prize case.

So, let's compute each of these.

First, exactly two matches: C(4,2) is 6. C(6,2) is (6*5)/(2*1) = 15. So, 6*15=90.

Exactly three matches: C(4,3)=4. C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.

Exactly four matches: 1.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) is 115/210.

Simplify that: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 รท5=23, 210 รท5=42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

But wait, let me double-check the counts because it's easy to make a mistake here.

Wait, for exactly two matches: C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15, so 6*15=90, that seems correct.

Exactly three matches: C(4,
