Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a triangle ABC. There are eight circles of radius 34 that are sequentially tangent, and two of them are tangent to sides AB and BC of the triangle. Then, it says that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. There are eight circles, each tangent to the next, so they form a kind of chain. Since two of them are tangent to AB and BC, I'm thinking this must be related to the incircle or maybe some excircle of the triangle. But wait, the circles are arranged in such a way that they are tangent to the sides AB and BC, and each other. So perhaps they form a part of a larger structure, like a chain of circles tangent to two sides of the triangle and each other.

Wait, when the problem mentions that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner, I think this is referring to a similar configuration but with smaller circles. So maybe the original eight circles are part of a process where you can fit more circles, each time making them smaller, and the inradius is determined by scaling this configuration.

I remember that when you have circles tangent to two sides of a triangle and each other, their radii form a geometric progression. Maybe that's the case here. So if there are eight circles of radius 34, and then 2024 circles of radius 1, perhaps each subsequent circle's radius is scaled by a factor related to the triangle's inradius.

Wait, let me think. If the circles are tangent to two sides of the triangle, their centers lie along the angle bisector of the angle at that vertex. Since AB and BC are sides, the angle at B is being considered here. So the centers of these circles lie along the bisector of angle B.

In a triangle, the inradius is related to the area and semiperimeter. But here, I'm dealing with multiple circles along the angle bisector. Maybe each circle is an "excircle" or part of a chain inside the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps this is similar to the problem of circles packed along the angle bisector, each tangent to the two sides and the previous circle. For two circles tangent
