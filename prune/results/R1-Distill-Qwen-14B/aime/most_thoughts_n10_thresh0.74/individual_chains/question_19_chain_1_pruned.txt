Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, let's start by listing what we know.

First, the triangle has a circumradius R = 13. The inradius is r = 6. The incenter I and the circumcenter O are two important centers in a triangle. The incenter is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter is where the perpendicular bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. That seems like a specific condition that might relate some properties of the triangle.

I think I need to find AB·AC. Let me recall some formulas related to triangle centers and inradius and circumradius.

I know that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.

Let me plug in the values we have. R = 13, r = 6.

So OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13.

Therefore, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, that's a useful piece of information. So the distance between O and I is sqrt(13).

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras theorem:

IA² + OI² = OA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA = 13.

We know OI = sqrt(13), so IA² + (sqrt(13))² = 13².

IA² + 13 = 169.

Therefore, IA² = 169 - 13 = 156.

So IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, okay. IA is 2*sqrt(39). Now, IA is the length of the inradius from I to A. Wait, no, IA is the distance from incenter I to vertex A, not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, which is 6.

So IA is the distance from incenter I to vertex A. I think this is called the 'length of the inradius' but actually, it's not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to the sides, but IA is the length from I to a vertex.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.

Specifically, IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is angle at vertex A.

Wait, let me confirm that formula. I think it's:

The distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2).

Yes, because in the inradius formulas, the inradius r = (Δ)/s, where Δ is the area and s is the semi-perimeter. Also, in the exradius formulas, perhaps, but more importantly, in the formula for the length of the angle bisector, or perhaps in the formula for the distance from incenter to vertex.

Alternatively, in triangle AII_a, where I_a is the excenter opposite A, but maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of coordinates or vectors, but maybe that's overkill.

Alternatively, maybe we can relate IA with other triangle parameters.

Wait, let me think. In triangle ABC, the inradius r is 6, OI is sqrt(13), and IA is 2*sqrt(39).

I also know that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed as:

IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2),

where s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A.

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall.

I think the formula is IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2).

Yes, that seems right. Because the inradius is r, and the ex-radius related to the semi-perimeter minus a side.

So, if that's the case, in our problem:

IA² = r² + (s - a)^2.

We have IA² = 156, r = 6, so r² = 36.

So, 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2.

Therefore, (s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120.

So, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).

Hmm, okay. So s - a = 2*sqrt(30). Let's denote that as equation (1).

Now, s is the semi-perimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2.

Therefore, s - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (-a + b + c)/2.

So, (-a + b + c)/2 = 2*sqrt(30).

Multiplying both sides by 2:

-b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30).

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute again.

s - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = ( -a + b + c ) / 2.

So, ( -a + b + c ) / 2 = 2*sqrt(30).

So, multiply both sides by 2:

(-a + b + c) = 4*sqrt(30).

So, that's equation (1a): -a + b + c = 4*sqrt(30).

Hmm, okay. Now, I need another equation to relate these variables.

We also know that the triangle has circumradius R = 13.

I remember that the formula for the circumradius is:

R = (a*b*c) / (4Δ),

where Δ is the area of the triangle.

Alternatively, another formula is that a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

So, since R = 13, we can write a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

Also, the inradius r is given by r = Δ / s, where Δ is the area and s is the semi-perimeter.

We know r = 6, so Δ = 6*s.

So, Δ = 6s.

Also, since R is known, perhaps we can use other relations.

Moreover, I think we can use the formula that relates OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Wait, no, earlier I used OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check that.

I think the correct formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check
