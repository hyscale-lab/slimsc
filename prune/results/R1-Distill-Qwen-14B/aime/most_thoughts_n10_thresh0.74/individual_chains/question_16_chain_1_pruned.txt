Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². So, two parts: first find p, then find m.

I remember that primes where -1 is a quartic residue are important here. Because n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² implies that -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. Wait, but maybe I should think about it differently. Let me recall that for primes p, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² implies that n² ≡ sqrt(-1) mod p², but perhaps it's easier to consider modulo p first.

So, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then certainly n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. So, -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p. Therefore, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution. I think this relates to the order of -1 modulo p. Or maybe the multiplicative order of n modulo p, since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p implies that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p, so the order of n modulo p divides 8 but doesn't divide 4, right? Because n⁴ ≡ -1, not 1. So the order would be 8.

But for that to happen, the multiplicative group modulo p must have an element of order 8, which implies that 8 divides p-1, because the multiplicative group is cyclic. So p ≡ 1 mod 8. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's 1 mod something else? Let me think. If the multiplicative group has order p-1, and 8 divides p-1, then yes, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the only condition. Because we're looking for primes where -1 is a quartic residue. Alternatively, maybe I can use Euler's criterion. For an odd prime p, -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. But here we're dealing with quartic residues, so maybe the condition is stricter.

I think that -1 is a quartic residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because the multiplicative group has order p-1, which needs to be divisible by 8 for there to exist an element of order 8, which is needed for -1 to be a quartic residue. Wait, because (-1)^2 = 1, so if there's an element of order 8, then raising it to the 4th power would give -1. So yeah, that seems right.

So the primes p where -1 is a quartic residue are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8. So the smallest primes would be 17, 97, etc. Wait, but is that necessarily the case? Because when p=17, is n⁴ +1 divisible by p²? Or is that only for some primes?

Wait, actually, I think that for p=17, it's possible that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. So perhaps p=17 is the smallest prime satisfying the condition. Let me check smaller primes first.

So, starting with p=2. Let's see, if p=2, then p²=4. So we need n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 4. Let's compute n⁴
