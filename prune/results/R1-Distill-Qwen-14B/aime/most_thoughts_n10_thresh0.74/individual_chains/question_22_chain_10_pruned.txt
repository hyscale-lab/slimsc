Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to visualize it first. A convex hexagon means all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and none of the sides cross each other. It's also equilateral, so all the sides are of equal length. Additionally, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, interesting. So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel, I think.

Now, the problem says that if we extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Let me break this down. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon must be similar to a regular hexagon but scaled somehow. Wait, no, not necessarily regular because the triangle formed by extensions has different side lengths. So, maybe it's a type of affine-regular hexagon or something like that.

I remember that in such hexagons, the extensions of every other side form a triangle. So, each side is extended, and the triangle formed has sides that are proportional to the sides of the hexagon? Or maybe they are related through some scaling factors.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using coordinate geometry. Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon. Let's say that the hexagon is such that when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet at three points forming a triangle. Let me denote these three points as P, Q, R, where PQ=200, QR=240, and PR=300.

But I'm not sure how exactly to model the hexagon within this triangle. Maybe each side of the hexagon is a portion of the triangle's sides. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each of its sides must be equal, say length 's'. So, each side of the triangle is divided into two segments by the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides? Or maybe we can use similar triangles or proportions.

Another approach: in such a hexagon, the sides can be thought of as vectors. Since opposite sides are equal and parallel, the vectors representing opposite sides are equal. So, the hexagon can be considered as being formed by three pairs of equal and parallel vectors.

Let me think
