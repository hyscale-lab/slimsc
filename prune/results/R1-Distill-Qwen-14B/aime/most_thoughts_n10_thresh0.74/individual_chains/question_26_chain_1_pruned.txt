Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers, and then find m + n.

Alright, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, triangle with sides 5, 9, 10. Hmm, that's a scalene triangle. It's inscribed in a circle, which is the circumcircle of the triangle. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, no, for a circle, the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or the ex-circle center? Maybe I'm mixing terms. Anyway, D is the intersection of tangents at B and C. 

I remember that in a circle, the tangent at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, DB is tangent to ω at B, so DB is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω. Similarly, DC is tangent to ω at C, so DC is perpendicular to OC. 

So, point D lies on the external angle bisector of angle BOC or something? Maybe, but maybe I should think about the properties of D. Alternatively, perhaps I can use some power of a point theorem here because D lies outside the circle and has two tangents DB and DC. 

Right, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². So, DB = DC, making D equidistant from B and C. That means D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. Hmm, but does that help me? Maybe, but perhaps I should think about the power of D as well.

Wait, we're supposed to find AP where AD intersects ω again at P. So, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P. Since AD is a secant line, perhaps we can apply the power of point A with respect to ω? Wait, no, because A is on the circle, so its power is zero. Hmm.

Wait, but D is outside the circle, so maybe the power of D with respect to ω can help. The power of D is equal to DB² = DC², which is also equal to DA * DP. Because AD is a secant from D passing through A and P, so DA * DP = DB². 

So, if I can find DB, then I can find DP, and since I know AD, I can then find AP. Alternatively, if I can find AD first, I can use that in the equation. Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, maybe using harmonic division or inversion
