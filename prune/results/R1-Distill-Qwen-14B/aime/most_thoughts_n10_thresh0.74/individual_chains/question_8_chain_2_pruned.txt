Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let's write down what's given:

1. a + b + c = 300.
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I need to find all nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) to these equations.

I remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric equations, it's helpful to look for symmetries or factorizations. Let me see if I can factor the second equation.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Hmm, I notice that each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Maybe I can factor it somehow.

Wait, perhaps I can factor by grouping. Let's try grouping terms:

Group terms with a²: a²(b + c)
Group terms with b²: b²(a + c)
Group terms with c²: c²(a + b)

So, the equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others.

Let me try that.

So, substituting:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's an interesting form. Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this as 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable. I wonder if I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of the sum a + b + c.

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since a + b + c = 300, this gives:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)
So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)
Which means, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc. Maybe I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3P.

Plugging S = 300, this becomes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P.

Let me compute 300³: 300 * 300 = 90,000, then 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P.

Now, going back to the equation we had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expressions:

300(a² + b² + c²) = 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 600 Q = 27,000,000 - 600 Q.

And (a³ + b³ + c³) = 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P.

So, subtracting:

27,000,000 - 600 Q - (27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Simplify inside the brackets:

27,000,000 - 600 Q - 27,000,000 + 900 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify term by term:

27,000,000 cancels with -27,000,000.

-600 Q + 900 Q = 300 Q.

So, 300 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of Q and P. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Let's see.

Wait, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300, perhaps we can consider different cases where two variables are equal or something like that. Alternatively, maybe we can think of a, b, c as variables that can take on certain values, perhaps in a symmetric way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of variables x, y, z where x = a, y = b, z = c. But that's the same as before.

Wait, let's think about the equation 300 Q - P = 2,000,000. Wait, no, earlier we had P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

Wait, correction: P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

So, P + 2,000,000 = 100 Q.

Which suggests that 100 divides (P + 2,000,000), meaning P is congruent to 0 mod 100, since 2,000,000 is divisible by 100.

So, P must be a multiple of 100. That's a useful constraint.

But perhaps that's not directly helpful. Let me think about what other relations I can get.

We know S = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc.

So, the monic cubic equation with roots a, b, c is:

t³ - S t² + Q t - P = 0.

Which is t³ - 300 t² + Q t - P = 0.

But I don't know if that directly helps. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the given equation 300 Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, 300 Q = P + 2,000,000.

But since P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ac, perhaps we can find some relation here.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to think in terms of variables. Let me
