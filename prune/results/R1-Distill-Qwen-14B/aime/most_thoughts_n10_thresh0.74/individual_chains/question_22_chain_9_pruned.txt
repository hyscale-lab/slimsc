Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what an equilateral hexagon is. It's a six-sided polygon where all sides are equal in length. But in this case, it's also convex and all opposite sides are parallel. That must mean the hexagon has a sort of symmetry, maybe similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all internal angles equal.

Wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all opposite sides are parallel, but here it's just equilateral and opposite sides are parallel. So maybe it's a more general case.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I imagine the hexagon ABCDEF, with AB, CD, EF being three sides, and their extensions forming a triangle. Let me try to visualize this.

Since all opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in a hexagon, each side has an opposite side two steps away. So, if the hexagon is labeled in order as A, B, C, D, E, F, then the opposite sides would be AB opposite to ED, BC opposite to FE, and CD opposite to AF. Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon is such that AB is parallel to ED, BC is parallel to FE, and CD is parallel to AF. But I'm not entirely sure, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is such that sides AB, CD, and EF are all non-adjacent and their extensions form a triangle. Wait, but in a convex hexagon, each side is adjacent to two others, so AB and CD are two sides with one side separating them. So, AB is followed by BC, then CD, so they're two sides apart.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for similar problems or properties of such hexagons. I remember that in such a case, the hexagon can be considered as being formed by three pairs of parallel
