Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand and break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. So, her walk is 9 kilometers each time.

It mentions that when she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. Hmm, wait, that means the total time from when she starts walking until she finishes her coffee is 4 hours. But actually, the walking time plus the coffee time? Wait, no, no, the problem says she walks at speed s and the walk takes her 4 hours including t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense because walking 9 km at speed s would take less than 4 hours, right?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read it again.

"When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop."

Oh, okay, so the total time from when she starts until she finishes everything (the walk and the coffee) is 4 hours. But the coffee time is t minutes, which is part of that 4 hours. So, the actual walking time would be 4 hours minus t minutes, right?

Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. So again, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which includes the walking time and the coffee time t.

So, the problem is giving me two scenarios where the total time (walking + coffee) is different when her walking speed is different. And from that, I need to find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee time.

Wait, okay, let me note down the given data.

First scenario:
- Speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours = 240 minutes
- Coffee time: t minutes
- So, walking time = 240 - t minutes.

Second scenario:
- Speed: (s + 2)
