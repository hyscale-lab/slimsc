Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a specific set. The set, called B, consists of all rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The goal is to find r squared, where r is the radius of this smallest sphere. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area and volume can be related to its dimensions. So, let's denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, and z. 

The surface area (SA) of a rectangular box is given by the formula:
SA = 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54.

The volume (V) is given by:
V = xyz = 23.

We need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's diameter must be equal to the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box. The space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box is calculated using the formula:
d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²).

Since the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal, the radius r would be half of that:
r = d/2 = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2.

So, r squared would be:
r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Therefore, if I can find the minimal value of x² + y² + z² for boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then I can find r squared.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² given the constraints:
2(xy + yz + xz) = 54,
and
xyz = 23.

I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a smarter way using inequalities. Let me recall some mathematical inequalities.

I remember that for positive real numbers, the Arithmetic Mean is greater than or equal to the Geometric Mean. Maybe that can help here.

But first, let's see if I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and volume. Hmm.

I recall that:
(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz).

We know that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, so (xy + yz + xz) = 27.

Therefore, (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2*27 = x² + y² + z² + 54.

So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

If I can find the minimum value of (x + y + z)^2, then subtracting 54 would give me x² + y² + z², which I can then use to find r².

Wait, but how do I find the minimum of (x + y + z)^2 given the constraints on surface area and volume?

Alternatively, since I have two constraints, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others and substitute.

Let me try that. Let me solve for one variable, say z, from the volume equation:

xyz = 23 => z = 23/(xy).

Now, substitute z into the surface area equation:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54.

Substituting z:

2(xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy))) = 54.

Simplify term by term:

First term: xy
Second term: y*(23/(xy)) = 23/x
Third term: x*(23/(xy)) = 23/y

So, the equation becomes:

2(xy + 23/x + 23/y) = 54.

Divide both sides by 2:

xy + 23/x + 23/y = 27.

Hmm, okay. So now I have an equation in terms of x and y.

Let me denote S = x + y, and maybe P = xy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate this equation further.

Wait, let me write it again:

xy + 23/x + 23/y = 27.

Let me factor 23:

xy + 23(1/x + 1/y) = 27.

Hmm, perhaps I can express 1/x + 1/y as (x + y)/(xy). Let me try that:

xy + 23*( (x + y)/xy ) = 27.

Let me denote S = x + y and P = xy. Then, the equation becomes:

P + 23*(S / P) = 27.

Multiply both sides by P to eliminate the denominator:

P² + 23*S = 27*P.

So, we have:

P² - 27P + 23S = 0.

Hmm, but I also know that for two variables x and y, the square of their sum is S² = x² + y² + 2P.

But I don't know if that's helpful yet. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I can relate this to the expression for x² + y² + z².

Earlier, we had:

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

But z = 23/(xy) = 23/P.

So, x + y + z = S + 23/P.

Therefore,

x² + y² + z² = (S + 23/P)^2 - 54.

But I also know that S² = x² + y² + 2P.

So, x² + y² = S² - 2P.

Then, x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P + (23/P)^2.

Hmm, that might not directly help. Let's see.

From earlier, we have:

P² - 27P + 23S = 0.

Which can be rewritten as:

23S = -P² + 27P.

So, S = (-P² + 27P)/23.

So, S is expressed in terms of P.

Then, going back to x² + y² + z²:

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54 = (S + 23/P)^2 - 54.

Substituting S:

= [ (-P² + 27P)/23 + 23/P ]^2 - 54.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's try to compute it.

First, let me compute the expression inside the square:

A = (-P² + 27P)/23 + 23/P.

Let me write both terms with a common denominator.

The first term is (-P² + 27P)/23, and the second term is 23/P.

So, to add them, common denominator would be 23P:

A = [ (-P² + 27P)*P + 23*23 ] / (23P).

Compute numerator:

(-P^3 + 27P²) + 529.

So,

A = (-P^3 + 27P² + 529) / (23P).

So, x² + y² + z² = [ (-P^3 + 27P² + 529) / (23P) ]^2 - 54.

This seems even more complicated. Maybe I'm going down the wrong path.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use symmetry. Maybe the minimal sphere occurs when x = y = z, but wait, that would be a cube, but in our case, the surface area and volume don't correspond to a cube.

Wait, for a cube, surface area would be 6x², and volume x³. So, if we set 6x² = 54, x² = 9, x=3. Then volume would be 27. But our volume is 23, so it's not a cube. So, the minimal sphere might not correspond to a cube. So maybe the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different. That's a common scenario in optimization problems with symmetric constraints.

So, perhaps I can assume x = y, and
