Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I want to make sure I understand it completely before diving into solving it. The problem is asking for two things:

1. Find the least prime number \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). In other words, \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \).

2. Then, using that prime \( p \), find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

So, the first step is to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Once we have that \( p \), we need to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let me break this down. I remember that primes can have specific properties related to congruences and exponents. Maybe Fermat's little theorem or Euler's theorem could come into play here? Or perhaps something related to orders modulo primes.

First, let's think about the primes \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). So, \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). That means that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \mod p^2 \), since squaring both sides gives \( n^8 \equiv 1 \mod p^2 \). So, the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) divides 8. Hmm, but the order must also divide \( \phi(p^2) \), which is \( p(p-1) \). So, the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must divide both 8 and \( p(p-1) \).

Wait, I think I remember that for primes \( p \) where \( p \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), \( -1 \) is a quadratic residue modulo \( p \). But in this case, we're dealing with \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \), which is a quartic residue. So, maybe the prime needs to satisfy certain conditions for this to hold.

I think that for \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \) to have a solution, the prime \( p \) must satisfy that the multiplicative order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) is 8. Because if \( n^8 \equiv 1 \mod p^2 \) and \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \), then the order can't be less than 8, so it must be exactly 8.

So, the multiplicative order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be 8. For the order to be 8, 8 must divide \( \phi(p^2) = p(p-1) \). So, \( p(p-1) \) must be divisible by 8. Let's see what primes satisfy this.

If \( p = 2 \), then \( \phi(2^2) = 2*1=2 \). So, 8 does not divide 2. So, \( p = 2 \) cannot have order 8, so \( 2^2 =4 \) cannot divide \( n^4 +1 \). Wait, but let's test with \( p = 2 \). Let me see if \( n^4 +1 \) is divisible by 4 for some \( n \).

Take \( n = 1 \): \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), not divisible by 4.

\( n = 2 \): \( 16 + 1 =17 \), which is 1 mod 4, so not 0.

\( n = 3 \): 81 +1 =82, which is 2 mod4, not 0.

\( n=4 \): 256 +1=257, 1 mod4. So, it seems like no \( n \) satisfies \( 4 \) dividing \( n^4 +1 \). So, \( p=2 \) is out.

Next prime is \( p=3 \). Let's check if 9 divides \( n^4 +1 \) for some \( n \).

Compute \( n^4 \mod 9 \) for \( n=1 \) to \( 8 \) (since modulo 9, residues repeat every 9).

n=1: 1^4=1 mod9, so 1+1=2 mod9, not 0.

n=2: 16 mod9=7, 7+1=8 mod9, not 0.

n=3: 81 mod9=0, 0+1=1 mod9.

n=4: 256 mod9: 256 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, remainder 4. So 4+1=5 mod9.

n=5: 625 mod9: 625 /9=69*9=621, remainder 4. So same as n=4: 4+1=5.

n=6: 6^4 = (6^2)^2=36^2=1296. 1296 mod9=0, 0+1=1.

n=7: 7^4 = (49)^2. 49 mod9 is 4, so 4^2=16 mod9=7. 7+1=8.

n=8: 8^4 = (64)^2. 64 mod9: 64-7*9=64-63=1. So 1^2=1, 1+1=2.

So, none of n=1 to 8 give \( n^4 +1 \equiv 0 \mod9 \). So, \( p=3 \) is not a candidate.

Next prime: \( p=5 \). Let's check if \( 25 \) divides \( n^4 +1 \) for some \( n \).

First, find \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod25 \). To find such \( n \), maybe I can compute \( n^4 \) mod25 for n from 1 to 24 and see if any give 24 (since -1 mod25 is 24).

Wait, that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can use properties of exponents.

We know that modulo 5, first, let's consider \( n^4 \equiv 1 \mod5 \) by Fermat's little theorem, except when n is a multiple of 5. But here, we are working modulo 25.

So, maybe Hensel's lemma can help lift solutions from modulo 5 to modulo 25.

Wait, in modulo 5, if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod5 \). But in mod5, -1 is 4. So, \( n^4 \equiv4 mod5 \). Let's compute \( n^4 mod5 \) for n=1 to 4 (since 5 is prime, residues repeat every 5).

n=1: 1^4=1 mod5.

n=2: 16 mod5=1.

n=3: 81 mod5=1.

n=4: 256 mod5=1.

So, in mod5, \( n^4 \) is always 1, except when n is 0 mod5, where it's 0. So, in mod5, \( n^4 \equiv1 \) if \( n \) is not 0 mod5. So, \( n^4 \equiv4 mod5 \) would require that 1 ≡4 mod5, which is impossible. So, there are no solutions modulo 5, so Hensel's lemma won't help—meaning that there's no solution modulo25 either.

Therefore, \( p=5 \) is out.

Next prime: \( p=7 \). Let's see if \( 49 \) divides \( n^4 +1 \) for some \( n \).

First, let's check modulo7.

We have \( n^4 \mod7 \). Let's compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to 6.

n=1:1 mod7.

n=2:16=2 mod7.

n=3:81=4 mod7.

n=4:256=4 mod7.

n=5:625=625-89*7=625-623=2 mod7.

n=6:1296=1296-185*7=1296-1295=1 mod7.

So, possible quartic residues modulo7 are 1,2,4.

Looking for \( n^4 \equiv -1 mod7 \). Since -1 mod7=6. So, does any of the quartic residues equal 6? From above, no. So, there's no solution modulo7, hence no solution modulo49 either.

Thus, \( p=7 \) is out.

Next prime: \( p=11 \). Let's see if \( 121 \) divides \( n^4 +1 \) for some \( n \).

Again, first, check modulo11.

Compute \( n^4 mod11 \) for n=1 to 10.

n=1:1

n=2:16=5

n=3:81=4

n=4:256= 256-23*11=256-253=3

n=5:625=625-56*11=625-616=9

n=6:1296=1296-117*11=1296-1287=9

n=7:2401=2401-218*11=2401-2398=3

n=8:4096=4096-372*11=4096-4092=4

n=9:6561=6561-596*11=6561-6556=5

n=10:10000=10000-909*11=10000-9999=1

So, quartic residues mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9.

Looking for \( n^4 ≡10 mod11 \) since -1 mod11=10. But in the list above, we don't see any quartic residues equal to 10. So, there is no solution modulo11, hence no solution modulo121.

Thus, \( p=11 \) is out.

Next prime: \( p=13 \). Let's check modulo13.

Compute \( n^4 mod13 \) for n=1 to 12.

n=1:1

n=2:16=3

n=3:81=3

n=4:256=256-19*13=256-247=9

n=5:625=625-48*13=625-624=1

n=6:1296=1296-99*13=1296-1287=9

n=7:2401=2401-184*13=2401-2392=9

n=8:4096=4096-315*13=4096-4095=1

n=9:6561=6561-504*13=6561-6552=9

n=10:10000=10000-769*13=10000-9997=3

n=11:14641=14641-1126*13=14641-14638=3

n=12:20736=20736-1595*13=20736-20735=1

So, quartic residues modulo13 are 1,3,9.

Looking for \( n^4 ≡12 mod13 \) (since -1 mod13=12). But 12 is not among the quartic residues. So, no solution mod13, hence no solution mod169.

Thus, \( p=13 \) is out.

Next prime: \( p=17 \). Check mod17.

Compute \( n^4 mod17 \) for n=1 to 16.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's recall that the multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic with order 16. So, the exponents can be considered modulo16.

We know that \( n^4 \equiv -1 mod17 \). Let's see if this is possible.

Since the order of the group is 16, the possible orders of elements divide 16. So, if n^4 ≡ -1, then squaring both sides: \( n^8 ≡ 1 mod17 \). So, the order of n must divide 8, but not divide 4 since \( n^4 ≡-1≠1 mod17 \). So, the order is 8.

Thus, 8 must divide the order of the group, which it does, as 8 divides 16. So, such elements exist.

Therefore, there exists n such that n^4 ≡-1 mod17. So, perhaps we can find such an n.

Compute n^4 mod17:

Let me compute n=2: 16 mod17=16, so n=2: 2^4=16≡-1 mod17. Oh, wow, that works. So, n=2: 2^4=16≡-1 mod17.

So, n=2 is a solution modulo17. Now, can we lift this solution to modulo17²=289 using Hensel's lemma?

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n)=n^4 +1, then if f(n)≡0 modp and f’(n) not ≡0 modp, then the solution can be lifted uniquely modulo p².

So, compute f(2) mod17: 2^4 +1=17≡0 mod17.

Compute f’(n)=4n^3. So, f’(2)=4*(8)=32 mod17=32-17=15≡15 mod17≠0. So, Hensel's lemma applies, meaning there's a unique solution modulo289 congruent to 2 modulo17.

Therefore, there exists an integer m ≡2 mod17 such that m^4 +1 ≡0 mod289.

Hence, p=17 is the prime we are looking for, since it's the smallest prime where p² divides n^4 +1.

Wait, but before jumping to conclusions, let me check if I missed any primes between 13 and 17. The primes after 13 are 17, 19, 23, etc. So, 17 is the next prime after 13.

But let me confirm for p=17, whether it's indeed the least prime for which p² divides n^4 +1 for some n.

I think I've checked all primes up to 17, and none of them worked, so p=17 is indeed the least such prime.

Now, the second part is to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

Given that n=2 is a solution modulo17, but we need to find the minimal m such that m^4 +1 ≡0 mod289. So, m ≡2 mod17, but we need to find the smallest m>0 such that m^4 ≡-1 mod289.

So, let m=2 +17k, where k is a non-negative integer.

We can compute m^4 mod289 for k=0,1,2,... until we find the smallest k such that (2 +17k)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Alternatively, since Hensel's lemma gives a unique lift, there is a unique solution mod289 congruent to 2 mod17. So, we can compute it step by step.

Let me compute m=2 +17k. Let's compute m^4 +1 mod289.

Compute m=2: m^4=16, 16+1=17≡17 mod289≠0.

m=2+17=19: Compute 19^4 +1.

Compute 19^2=361. 361 mod289=361-289=72.

Then 72^2=5184. 5184 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 goes into 5184.

Compute 289*17=4913. 5184-4913=271. So, 5184≡271 mod289. Then, 271 +1=272≡272 mod289≠0.

So, m=19: 19^4 +1≡272 mod289≠0.

Next, k=2: m=2+34=36.

Compute 36^4 mod289. Let's compute step by step.

36^2=1296. 1296 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1296-1156=140. So, 36^2≡140 mod289.

Then, 140^2=19600. 19600 mod289: Let's compute 289*67=289*(70-3)=289*70=20230, 289*3=867, so 20230-867=19363.

19600-19363=237. So, 36^4 ≡237 mod289. Then, 237 +1=238≡238≠0.

So, m=36: 36^4 +1≡238 mod289≠0.

Next, k=3: m=2+51=53.

Compute 53^4 mod289.

53 mod289=53.

53^2=2809. 2809 mod289: Let's divide 2809 by289.

289*9=2601. 2809-2601=208. So, 53^2≡208 mod289.

Then, 208^2=43264. Compute 43264 mod289.

Compute how many times 289 goes into 43264.

289*150=43350. 43264-43350= -86. But we can add 289 to get positive: -86+289=203. So, 208^2≡203 mod289. Then, 203 +1=204≡204≠0.

So, m=53: 53^4+1≡204 mod289≠0.

k=4: m=2+68=70.

Compute 70^4 mod289.

70 mod289=70.

70^2=4900. 4900 mod289: 289*16=4624, 4900-4624=276. So, 70^2≡276 mod289.

276^2=76176. Now, 76176 mod289.

Compute 289*263=289*(260+3)=289*260 +289*3.

289*260: 289*200=57800, 289*60=17340; total 57800+17340=75140.

289*3=867.

So, 75140+867=76007.

76176-76007=169. So, 276^2≡169 mod289.

Thus, 70^4≡169 mod289. Then, 169+1=170≡170≠0.

m=70: 70^4 +1≡170 mod289≠0.

k=5: m=2+85=87.

Compute 87^4 mod289.

87 mod289=87.

87^2=7569. 7569 mod289: Let's compute 289*26=7514. 7569-7514=55. So, 87^2≡55 mod289.

Then, 55^2=3025. 3025 mod289: 289*10=2890. 3025-2890=135. So, 55^2≡135 mod289.

Thus, 87^4≡135 mod289. 135 +1=136≡136≠0.

k=6: m=2+102=104.

Compute 104^4 mod289.

104 mod289=104.

104^2=10816. 10816 mod289.

Compute how many times 289 goes into 10816.

289*37=289*(30+7)=8670+2023=10693.

10816-10693=123. So, 104^2≡123 mod289.

123^2=15129. 15129 mod289.

Compute 289*52=289*(50+2)=14450+578=15028.

15129-15028=101. So, 123^2≡101 mod289.

Thus, 104^4≡101 mod289. 101 +1=102≠0.

k=7: m=2+119=121.

121 mod289=121.

121^2=14641. 14641 mod289.

Compute 289*50=14450. 14641-14450=191. So, 121^2≡191 mod289.

191^2=36481. 36481 mod289.

Compute 289*126=289*(120+6)=34680 +1734=36414.

36481-36414=67. So, 191^2≡67 mod289.

Thus, 121^4≡67 mod289. 67 +1=68≡68≠0.

k=8: m=2+136=138.

Compute 138^4 mod289.

138 mod289=138.

138^2=19044. 19044 mod289.

Compute 289*65=289*(60+5)=17340 +1445=18785.

19044-18785=259. 259-289= -30, so 259≡259 mod289.

Then, 259^2=67081. 67081 mod289.

Compute 289*231=289*(200+30+1)=57800 +8670 +289=57800+8670=66470 +289=66759.

67081-66759=322. 322-289=33. So, 259^2≡33 mod289.

Thus, 138^4≡33 mod289. 33+1=34≡34≠0.

k=9: m=2+153=155.

155 mod289=155.

155^2=24025. 24025 mod289.

Compute 289*83=289*(80+3)=23120 +867=23987.

24025-23987=38. So, 155^2≡38 mod289.

38^2=1444. 1444 mod289.

Compute 289*4=1156. 1444-1156=288≡-1 mod289.

So, 38^2≡-1 mod289. Therefore, 155^4≡(-1) mod289.

Thus, 155^4 +1 ≡ (-1) +1 =0 mod289.

Yay! So, m=155 is the solution.

But wait, is 155 the minimal positive integer?

Wait, let's check if any smaller m exists. Because m starts at 2, and we increased by 17 each time, the minimal m would be 155. Let me confirm.

Wait, but k=9 gives m=2 +17*9=155. So, since for k=0 to 8, none worked, m=155 is the smallest.

But wait, 155 is less than 289, so it's a positive integer less than 289. Is there a smaller m>0 such that m^4 +1 is divisible by289?

Wait, but m must be ≡2 mod17, so the possible candidates are 2,19,36,53,70,87,104,121,138,155, etc. Since none of the earlier ones worked, 155 is the first one that worked.

But is 155 really the minimal? Let me compute 155^4 +1.

Wait, 155 is 2 +17*9=155, and the computation above showed that 155^4 ≡-1 mod289. So, indeed, 155 is the minimal m.

Wait, but 155 is bigger than 17²=289? No, 155 is less than 289. So, the minimal positive integer m is 155.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Because 155 is 155, but perhaps some smaller m also works.

Wait, but since we checked all m=2+17k for k=0 to 8, and none worked, so the next one is k=9, which works. So, m=155 is indeed the minimal.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake when computing m=53. Let me double-check m=53.

53^4: 53^2=2809, which mod289 is 2809-9*289=2809-2601=208.

Then, 208^2=43264. 43264 divided by289. 289*150=43350. 43264-43350=-86. So, -86 mod289 is 203.

So, 53^4≡203 mod289, 203+1=204≠0. Correct.

Similarly, m=70: 70^2=4900 mod289: 4900-16*289=4900-4624=276.

276^2=76176. 76176 -289*263=76176-76007=169.

169+1=170≠0.

m=87: 87^2=7569 mod289: 7569-26*289=7569-7514=55.

55^2=3025 mod289:3025-10*289=3025-2890=135.

135+1=136≠0.

m=104:104^2=10816 mod289=10816-37*289=10816-10693=123.

123^2=15129 mod289=15129-52*289=15129-15028=101.

101+1=102≠0.

m=121:121^2=14641 mod289=14641-50*289=14641-14450=191.

191^2=36481 mod289=36481-126*289=36481-36414=67.

67+1=68≠0.

m=138:138^2=19044 mod289=19044-65*289=19044-18785=259.

259^2=67081 mod289=67081-231*289=67081-66759=322.

322 mod289=322-289=33.

33+1=34≠0.

m=155:155^2=24025 mod289=24025-83*289=24025-23987=38.

38^2=1444 mod289=1444-5*289=1444-1445= -1≡288 mod289.

So, 155^4≡288≡-1 mod289. Then, 155^4 +1≡0 mod289. So, correct.

Therefore, m=155 is indeed the minimal positive integer such that m^4 +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

So, putting it all together:

The least prime p is 17. The minimal m is 155.

Wait, but is there a way to get m smaller than 155? Because 155 is less than 289, but perhaps an even smaller m exists?

Wait, but m must be congruent to 2 mod17, so the candidates are 2,19,36,53,70,87,104,121,138,155,... So, the next m after 155 is 155+17=172, etc. So, since the first 10 candidates (k=0 to9) only worked at k=9, m=155 is indeed the minimal.

So, the final answers are p=17 and m=155.


The problem requires finding the least prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), and then determining the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

1. **Identifying the prime \( p \):**  
   We systematically check primes starting from the smallest. For each prime \( p \), we determine if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). This requires that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) is 8, which implies \( 8 \) must divide \( \phi(p^2) = p(p-1) \). After checking primes \( p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 \), none satisfy the condition. However, for \( p = 17 \), we find that \( n = 2 \) satisfies \( 2^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \), and using Hensel's lemma, this solution lifts uniquely to modulo \( 17^2 = 289 \). Thus, \( p = 17 \) is the least prime.

2. **Finding the minimal \( m \):**  
   Using Hensel's lemma, we lift the solution \( n = 2 \mod 17 \) to modulo \( 289 \). We test successive values \( m = 2 + 17k \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) until \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 289 \). After testing \( k = 0 \) to \( 8 \), none work, but \( k = 9 \) gives \( m = 155 \), where \( 155^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 289 \). Thus, \( m = 155 \) is the least positive integer satisfying the condition.

**Final Answer:**  
The least prime \( p \) is \( 17 \), and the least positive integer \( m \) is \( 155 \).  
\boxed{155}
