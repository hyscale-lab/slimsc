Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are given as:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me break it down step by step. First, I should understand what functions f and g are. 

The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract a constant, and then take the absolute value again. This likely creates a V-shaped graph, possibly with multiple segments.

Let me write down f(x) and g(x) clearly:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|

g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Okay, so f(x) is the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2, and similarly for g(x). Both functions are even functions because they depend on |x|, which is symmetric about the y-axis.

Now, the main equations involve compositions of these functions with sine and cosine functions. Let me see:

First equation: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

Second equation: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, these equations define y in terms of x and x in terms of y, respectively. The intersections occur where both equations are satisfied, meaning that (x, y) must satisfy both equations. So, to find the number of intersections, I need to solve these equations simultaneously.

But this seems complicated because y is defined in terms of x and x is defined in terms of y. Maybe I can substitute one into the other? Let's see.

From the first equation: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

From the second equation: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, if I substitute y from the first equation into the second, I get:

x = 4 g(f(cos(3π * [4 g(f(sin(2πx)))])))

That's a mouthful. Hmm, perhaps it's better to analyze these functions step by step, considering their periodicity and behavior.

Let me first analyze f and g.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:

The inner function is |x|, so it's V-shaped with the vertex at x=0. Then subtracting 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. This would shift the vertex down by 1/2, but since it's absolute value, it's not just shifting. Let me think.

Wait, when you have |x| - c, then taking the absolute value of that. So f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Let me plot f(x):

- When |x| >= 1/2, then |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.
- When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph that goes from the point (-1/2, 0) up to (0, 1/2) and then down again to (1/2, 0). So it's a W shape, but with a minimum at x=0 and maxima at x=±1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Same idea:

- For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.
- For |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So g(x) is V-shaped with a minimum at x=0, and points at x=±1/4, y=0.

Now, let's look at the first function: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

Let me dissect this. First, sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so 2π/(2π) = 1. So sin(2πx) has period 1.

Then, f is applied to sin(2πx). So f(sin(2πx)) is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Let me figure out the range of f(sin(2πx)). Since sin(2πx) ranges from -1 to 1, |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1.

So, let me consider t = |sin(2πx)|, which is between 0 and 1.

Then f(t) = |t - 1/2|. So, t varies from 0 to 1.

So f(t) is 1/2 - t when t < 1/2, and t - 1/2 when t >= 1/2.

Therefore, f(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, because when t is 0, f(t) is 1/2. When t is 1/2, f(t) is 0. When t is 1, f(t) is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

So f(t) is a V shape with minimum at t=1/2, and maximum at t=0 and t=1, both giving f(t)=1/2.

So, 4 g(f(t)) would then be 4 times g evaluated at f(t).

Since f(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2, let's see what g does when its input is in [0, 1/2].

g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|.

So, for x in [0, 1/2], which is our case since f(t) is between 0 and 1/2, g(x) is:

If x >= 1/4, then g(x) = x - 1/4.

If x < 1/4, then g(x) = 1/4 - x.

So, g(x) will output values from 0 to 1/4.

Wait, let me check:

At x=0: g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4.

At x=1/4: g(1/4)=|1/4 -1/4|=0.

At x=1/2: g(1/2)=|1/2 -1/4|=1/4.

So, yes, g(x) for x in [0,1/2] goes from 1/4 down to 0 at x=1/4, then back up to 1/4 at x=1/2.

So, 4 g(f(t)) would then scale this from 0 to 1.

Because g(f(t)) in [0,1/4] would scale to 0 to 1 when multiplied by 4.

Wait, no: wait, g(f(t)) is in [0,1/4], because the maximum of g is 1/4. So 4 * [0,1/4] is [0,1]. Therefore, 4 g(f(t)) can vary between 0 and 1.

So, putting it all together, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) will have a range of [0,1].

Similarly, let's analyze the second equation: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Same process. Let me denote u = cos(3πy). Then f(u) = ||u| - 1/2|, and then g(f(u))
