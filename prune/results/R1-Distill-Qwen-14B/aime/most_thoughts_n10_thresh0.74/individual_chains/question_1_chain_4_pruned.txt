Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z *
