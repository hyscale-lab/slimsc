Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. Let me read it again:

Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \).

Hmm. I need to find the maximum real part of this expression. Since \( z \) is a complex number with magnitude 4, that could be represented as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might come in handy later.

First, let me write \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \). Then \( \frac{1}{z} \) would be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because \( |1/z| = 1/|z| = 1/4 \).

So substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, we have:

\[ (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \)

Let me factor out the 4: \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

So the entire expression becomes:

\[ 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can write it in terms of sine and cosine. Remembering that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me denote \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \) for simplicity.

So the expression is \( 4A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me write each term in terms of real and imaginary parts.

First, \( 4A e^{i\theta} \):

\( 4A (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 4A \cos\theta + 4iA \sin\theta \)

Similarly, \( B e^{-i\theta} = B (\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = B \cos\theta - iB \sin\theta \)

So combining these, the entire expression becomes:

Real parts: \( 4A \cos\theta + B \cos\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( 4A \sin\theta - B \sin\theta \)

Wait, but the problem asks for the real part of the entire expression. So I can ignore the imaginary parts.

So the real part is \( (4A + B) \cos\theta \). Let me compute \( 4A + B \):

Given \( A = 75 + 117i \), so \( 4A = 4*75 + 4*117i = 300 + 468i \)
Then adding \( B = 24 + 36i \): \( 300 + 24 + 468i + 36i = 324 + 504i \)

Wait, so \( 4A + B = 324 + 504i \). Therefore, the real part is \( (324 + 504i) \cos\theta \). Wait, but that's a complex expression. How can the real part of the expression be complex? That doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. I think I messed up in how I separated the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, original expression after substitution:

\[ 4A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \]

So when I expand this, the real part is \( 4 \text{Re}(A) \cos\theta + 4 \text{Im}(A) \sin\theta + \text{Re}(B) \cos\theta - \text{Im}(B) \sin\theta \). Because \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), so multiplying by A gives both real and imaginary parts. Similarly for \( e^{-i\theta} \).

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me represent \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So the expression becomes:

\[ (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \]

Which is:

\[ 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} \]

Simplify the second term:

\( \frac{96}{4} = 24 \), \( \frac{144i}{4} = 36i \). So:

\[ 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Let me denote \( C = 75 + 117i \), so first term is \( 4C e^{i\theta} \), and second term is \( D e^{-i\theta} \) where \( D = 24 + 36i \).

So the expression is \( 4C e^{i\theta} + D e^{-i\theta} \). The real part of this would be \( 4 \times \text{Re}(C e^{i\theta}) + \text{Re}(D e^{-i\theta}) \).

Let me compute \( \text{Re}(C e^{i\theta}) \) and \( \text{Re}(D e^{-i\theta}) \).

Remembering that \( \text{Re}(X e^{i\theta}) = |X| \cos(\theta - \phi) \) where \( \phi \) is the argument of \( X \). Similarly, \( \text{Re}(X e^{-i\theta}) = |X| \cos(\theta + \phi) \).

Alternatively, \( \text{Re}(X e^{i\theta}) = X \cos\theta \) if X is a scalar, but when X is a complex number, it's more involved.

Wait, perhaps I should compute \( C e^{i\theta} \) as \( (75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \) and similarly for \( D e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute \( C e^{i\theta} \):

\( (75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2 \sin\theta \)
Simplify:

\( 75\cos\theta + (75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)i - 117\sin\theta \)
So real part is \( 75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta \)
Imaginary part is \( 75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta \)

Similarly, compute \( D e^{-i\theta} \):

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta
