Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

Alright, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers.

Let me break this down. First, n has exactly two digits in base b. That means n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. So, a can be from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit), and c can be from 0 to b-1.

Additionally, the sum of the digits a + c must equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c, which implies that n = (a + c)^2.

So putting it together, n = a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

So for each base b, I can iterate through possible a and c values and check if a*b + c is a perfect square equal to (a + c)^2.

But since b is the variable I'm trying to find, I need to find the smallest b where this equation has more than ten solutions (n's) for various a and c.

Let me write the equation again:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for b:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a.

Simplify the numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c.

So,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a.

Simplify by dividing each term by a:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

Hmm, since b must be an integer, the term (c^2 - c)/a must also be an integer. So, a must divide (c^2 - c).

That's an important point. So for each a and c, a must divide (c^2 - c). Also, a must be at least 1 and at most b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.

But since I'm looking for the minimal b, maybe I can approach this by iterating over possible a and c and seeing what b's they produce, then count how many times each b occurs.

Wait, but since a and c are digits in base b, a < b and c < b. So for a given b, a can be 1 to b-1 and c can be 0 to b-1.

But since I'm looking for the minimal b where the number of solutions exceeds ten, maybe I can model this problem by considering a and c first, and then compute b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can fix a and c and compute b, then see for which b's multiple (a,c) pairs yield the same b.

Let me think. For each a from 1 upwards and c from 0 upwards, I'll compute b as ( (a + c)^2 - c ) / a. Then, for each such b, I'll keep track of how many (a,c) pairs produce that b.

Once I have that, I can find the smallest b that has more than ten such pairs.

But wait, since a and c are digits, a must be less than b, and c must be less than b. So for each (a,c) pair, the computed b must be greater than a and greater than c. So I need to ensure that after computing b, it's indeed larger than a and c.

Let me try to outline the approach:

1. For a in 1 to some upper limit (I need to figure out how high to go)
2. For c in 0 to some upper limit
3. Compute b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a
4. Check if b is integer, and if a < b and c < b
5. If so, record this b and count how many times it occurs

But how high should I set the upper limits for a and c? Hmm, since I'm looking for the minimal b, maybe I can iterate a and c up to some reasonable number where b would be small enough to find the first b with over ten solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this equation differently.

From the equation a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me rearrange it:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

But (a + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

So,

a*b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

Divide both sides by a:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

So, for b to be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

So, a must be a divisor of (c^2 - c).

Let me factor c^2 - c as c(c -
