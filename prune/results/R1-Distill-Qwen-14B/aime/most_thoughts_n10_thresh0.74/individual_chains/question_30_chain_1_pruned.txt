Okay, I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, ω^k for k = 0 to 12 are all the distinct roots. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Looking at the product, each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote this as P_k = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. So the product we're looking to compute is the product of P_k from k=0 to 12.

Wait, but when k=0, ω⁰ = 1, so P_0 = 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. That simplifies things a bit because we can ignore the k=0 term since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. So the product is just the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Now, let me see if I can simplify each term P_k = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or express it in terms of something else. Let me write it as:

P_k = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set z = ω^k. Then P_k becomes z² - 2z + 2. So each term is a quadratic in z, where z is a root of unity, specifically z = ω^k, which is another primitive 13th root of unity because k and 13 are coprime (since 13 is prime and k is from 1 to 12).

So, each P_k is  z² - 2z + 2. Since z is a root of Φ₁₃(x), perhaps I can relate this quadratic to the minimal polynomial.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor this quadratic. Let me check its discriminant: discriminant D = (−2)² − 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So each P_k factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So, P_k = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). Substituting back z = ω^k, we get P_k = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the entire product from k=1 to 12 is the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Since multiplication is commutative, I can separate this into two products:

Product = [Product from k=1 to 12 (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [Product from k=1 to 12 (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all primitive roots of unity can be related to Φ_n(x). Wait, but here we're taking products over all roots except one. Let me recall that the product over all (x - ω^k) for k=1 to 12 is equal to Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1.

But in our case, the products are over (ω^k - a), which is like evaluating Φ₁₃(a) if I reverse the sign. Wait, more precisely, the product over (x - ω^k) from k=0 to 12 is x¹³ - 1, since ω is a root of x¹³ - 1 = 0, and the roots are 1, ω, ω², ..., ω¹². So, product from k=0 to 12 (x - ω^
