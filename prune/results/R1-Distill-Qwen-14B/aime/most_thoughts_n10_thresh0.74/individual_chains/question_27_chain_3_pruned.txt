Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere has a radius of 11.

The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me visualize this. A torus is like a surface of revolution, right? So if I have a circle of radius 3 and I spin it around an axis that's 6 units away from its center, the resulting torus will have a major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) of 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) of 3.

Wait, so for a torus, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So the standard equation of a torus in 3D can be given in terms of coordinates, but maybe I don't need that. Instead, perhaps I can think about the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus when they are tangent.

The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent internally. That means the distance between their centers is equal to the sphere's radius minus the torus's major radius? Or wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere is just touching the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center is touching.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the torus as a surface where every point is at a distance of 3 from the main circle of radius 6. So the torus can be thought of as the set of points where the distance from any point on the torus to the main circle (which is the axis of revolution) is 3.

Wait, the sphere has a radius of 11, so when the torus is inside, the sphere's center is at some point, and the torus is centered at a point that's away from the sphere's center by some distance.

Wait, maybe I need to model both the sphere and the torus with their centers aligned along the same axis. Let me assume that the sphere is centered at the origin (0,0,0), and the torus is centered along the z-axis, say at (d, 0, 0), where d is the distance between the centers.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is tangent to the sphere. Similarly, when it's outside, the farthest point is tangent.

Let me think about the torus. A point on the torus can be represented
