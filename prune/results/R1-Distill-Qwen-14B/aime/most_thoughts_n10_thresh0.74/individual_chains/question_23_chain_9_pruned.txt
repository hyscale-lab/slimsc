Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

"Let A, B, C, D be points on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi."

Hmm, okay. So, we have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus. The diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest number that's less than BD squared for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and we're looking for the supremum of BD squared, but the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, the maximum lower bound for BD²? Or wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. It says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, like, the maximum value that is always less than BD², regardless of the rhombus. So, the infimum of BD² across all possible such rhombi? Or maybe it's the maximum possible lower bound, which would be the infimum.

Wait, no. If it's the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, that would mean it's the infimum of BD². Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest real number that is less than or equal to BD² for all rhombi, but since it's less than BD² for all, maybe it's the infimum.

Wait, no. If it's the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi, then it's the infimum. Because if the infimum is m, then m is the greatest lower bound, so for any ε>0, there's a rhombus where BD² is less than m + ε. So, m is the infimum, and any number less than m would not be the greatest. So, yeah, the infimum is the answer.

But wait, maybe I should think about this more carefully. Let me see.

So, the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that number can't be larger than the infimum, because otherwise, for some rhombus, BD² could be less than that number. So, the answer would be the infimum of BD².

Wait, but maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me rephrase: I need to find a number m such that m < BD² for all such rhombi, and m is as large as possible. So, m is the infimum of BD². Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, yeah, the answer is the infimum of BD².

Okay, so now I need to find the infimum of BD² for all rhombuses ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

So, let me think about the properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? No, wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because a rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Wait, yes, I think that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, their slopes would be negative reciprocals if they aren't vertical or horizontal. So, that might be useful.

Also, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points A, B, C, D are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C, which is opposite
