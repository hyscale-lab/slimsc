Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the total number of residents is 900. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is a given. So, that's one thing everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers of people owning each are 195, 367, and 562 respectively.

Wait, so not everyone owns these other items. They’re specific to each group. Now, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We’re supposed to find how many own all four—so including the candy hearts, diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.

Hmm. This sounds like a problem where I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me remember how that works. I think it's for calculating the size of the union of multiple sets by adding their individual sizes, subtracting the sizes of all possible pairwise intersections, adding back the sizes of all possible triple intersections, and so on.

But in this case, we're given some specific numbers about how many people own exactly two or exactly three items. So maybe I can structure this with the inclusion-exclusion formula, but considering the exact counts.

Let me define the sets:

- Let D be the set of people owning a diamond ring. So, |D| = 195.
- Let G be the set of people owning golf clubs. So, |G| = 367.
- Let S be the set of people owning a garden spade. So, |S| = 562.
- Let C be the set of people owning candy hearts. Since everyone owns this, |C| = 900.

We’re asked for the number of people who own all four, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C includes everyone, this is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

The problem also gives the number of people owning exactly two of these things: 437. And exactly three: 234. So, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to relate these numbers.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The total number of elements in the union is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since C is the set that everyone is in, all intersections with C are just the other set. For example, |D∩C| = |D| because everyone who owns a diamond ring must own candy hearts. Similarly, |D∩G∩C| = |D∩G|, and so on.

This might complicate things, but maybe it's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the principle for three sets, since C is universal. Let me consider the problem without C first, but since C is always included, maybe that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to a Venn diagram with four circles, but since everyone is in C, it's like the fourth circle is the universal set, encompassing all others. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of all four items but considering that C is always present.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try a different approach. Maybe I can model this with the inclusion-exclusion for three sets, considering the three items D, G, S, and knowing that everyone is in C.

Wait, perhaps the exact counts given (exactly two and exactly three) can be used to form equations that can help us find the number who own all four.

Let me denote:

- a = number of people owning exactly one item
- b = number of people owning exactly two items = 437
- c = number of people owning exactly three items = 234
- d = number of people owning all four items.

Since everyone owns C, the four items each person can own are combinations of D, G, S, and C. But since C is always present, the combinations are based on D, G, S. So, for example, someone can own exactly D and C, or exactly D, G, and C, etc.

Wait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things. But since C is always present, owning exactly two would mean owning two of D, G, S, plus C. So, for instance, someone who owns exactly D and C, but not G or S is counted in the exactly two category. Similarly, someone who owns exactly D and G and C would be in the exactly three category.

So, perhaps the counts of a, b, c, d can be related to the inclusion-exclusion formula for the three sets D, G, S, because C is always present.

Wait, but perhaps the total number of people is equal to the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and all four. So:

Total residents = a + b + c + d
900 = a + 437 + 234 + d
So, a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

Hmm. So, a + d = 229.

But I'm not sure how that helps yet. Maybe I can find another equation relating a and d using the inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S.

Let me think: the inclusion-exclusion for three sets D, G, S would be:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But since everyone owns C, the union |D ∪ G ∪ S| is equal to the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S, but since C is always present, that's the same as the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. But wait, everyone has C, so the people who don't own any of D, G, or S are those who only own C. Let me compute that.

The number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S is |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - (number of people who don't own D, G, or S). Since each person owns C, but some don't own any of the other three. Let me denote u as the number of people who own only C. So u = number of people who don't own D, G, or S.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - u.

But, according to inclusion-exclusion, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

Now, let's compute the right-hand side. We know |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562. So:

195 + 367 + 562 = 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| is also equal to 900 - u. So,

900 - u = 1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is helpful yet. Maybe I can express |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S|, and |D∩G∩S| in terms of the exactly two and exactly three counts.

Wait, the exactly two counts would include the people who own exactly two of D, G, S, plus C. Similarly, the exactly three counts would include those owning exactly three of D, G, S, plus C, and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the counts of intersections in terms of the exactly two, exactly three, and all four.

Let me think: For two sets, say D and G, the intersection |D ∩ G| includes all people who own both D and G. These can be:

- Those who own exactly D, G, and nothing else except C. So that's some number.

Wait, but actually, the people in |D ∩ G| include:

- Those who own exactly D and G (and C), which is part of the exactly two category.

- Those who own exactly D, G, and S (and C), which is part of the exactly three category.

- Those who own all four, which is part of the exactly four category (but in our case, all four includes C, which is everyone, so that's the same as owning D, G, S, and C, which is the same as owning all three of D, G, S, plus C, which is the same as being in the exactly three category or higher.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try to model this.

In the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets D, G, S, the terms are as follows:

- |D| = number of people owning D (and C).

- |G| = number owning G (and C).

- |S| = number owning S (and C).

- |D∩G| = number owning D and G (and C).

But within |D∩G|, the people can have other items as well. So |D∩G| = number of people owning exactly D and G, plus those who own D, G, and S, plus those who own all four (but since everyone owns C, that's the same as owning D, G, S, and C, which is the exactly three category for D, G, S, but in the four-item context, it's exactly four.

Wait, maybe I should express |D∩G| in terms of the counts of exactly two, exactly three, and all four.

So, |D∩G| is the number of people who own both D and G, regardless of whether they own S or not. So that includes:

- Those who own exactly D and G: which is part of the exactly two category (b). Let's call this number x.

- Those who own exactly D, G, and S: which is part of the exactly three category (c). Let's call this number y.

- Those who own all four: which is part of the exactly four category (d). So, it's the same as owning D, G, S, and C, which is the same as d.

Wait, but in the three-set inclusion-exclusion, |D∩G| includes all those who own D and G, whether or not they own S or other things. So, |D∩G| = (number owning exactly D and G) + (number owning exactly D, G, and S) + (number owning all four). So:

|D∩G| = x + y + d.

Similarly, |D∩S| = w + y + d, where w is the number owning exactly D and S.

And |G∩S| = z + y + d, where z is the number owning exactly G and S.

Wait, but perhaps I can find expressions for x, w, z, y, and d based on the given counts of exactly two and exactly three.

So, the total number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is b = 437. So, each of these is the sum of x, w, z. Because exactly two can be D&G, D&S, or G&S.

So, x + w + z = 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of D, G, S is c = 234. So, y = 234.

And the number of people owning all four is d, which is what we're trying to find.

Now, using these, let's think about the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets D, G, S.

The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

We can compute |D ∪ G ∪ S| as the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S. Since everyone owns C, this is equal to 900 minus the number of people who don't own D, G, or S (i.e., those who only own C). Let's denote this number as u, so |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - u.

So, substituting into the formula:

900 - u = |D| + |G| + |S| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|.

We know |D| =195, |G|=367, |S|=562.

So, 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.

Now, |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| = (x + y + d) + (w + y + d) + (z + y + d) 

Wait, no. Wait, |D∩G| = x + y + d,

|D∩S| = w + y + d,

|G∩S| = z + y + d.

So adding them together:

|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| = (x + y + d) + (w + y + d) + (z + y + d) 

= x + w + z + 3y + 3d.

From earlier, x + w + z = 437, and y =234.

So substituting:

= 437 + 3*234 + 3d.

3*234 is 702, so:

= 437 + 702 + 3d = 1139 + 3d.

Now, |D∩G∩S| is the number of people who own all three of D, G, S, which is y + d, since y is exactly three and d is all four.

Wait, no. Wait, y is exactly three of D, G, S, plus C, which would make it exactly four in the four-item context. Wait, no, because in the three-set inclusion-exclusion, |D∩G∩S| is the number of people who own all three of D, G, S, regardless of other ownerships. But since we're considering exactly three in D, G, S, plus C, that's y. But |D∩G∩S| also includes those who own all four, which is d. So:

|D∩G∩S| = y + d.

So, now putting it all into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 - u = 1124 - (1139 + 3d) + (y + d).

But wait, let's compute each term:

900 - u = 1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|

We have:

= 1124 - [1139 +3d] + [y +d]

= 1124 -1139 -3d + y +d

= (1124 -1139) + (-3d + d) + y

= (-15) + (-2d) + y.

So,

900 - u = (-15) + (-2d) + y.

But we know y =234, so:

900 - u = (-15) + (-2d) + 234.

= 234 -15 = 219, so:

900 - u = 219 - 2d.

Hmm, but I also know that u is the number of people who own only C, which is part of the a + u = 229 from earlier, since a + d =229.

Wait, earlier we had:

Total residents = a + b + c + d,

where a is the number owning exactly one item.

But the exactly one item would only be C, since all other items (D, G, S) are subsets. So, a is the number of people owning exactly C, which is u.

So, a = u.

Hence, a + d =229,

so u + d =229.

So, from earlier:

900 - u = 219 - 2d.

And, from u + d =229,

we can express u =229 - d.

Substituting into the first equation:

900 - (229 - d) = 219 - 2d.

Let me compute this:

Left side: 900 -229 + d = 671 + d.

Right side: 219 -2d.

So,

671 + d = 219 -2d.

Bring variables to one side:

d +2d = 219 -671.

3d = -452.

Hmm, d = (-452)/3 ≈ -150.666...

Wait, that can't be right, because the number of people can't be negative. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me go through my steps again to find where I went wrong.

So, starting from the inclusion-exclusion:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

We said that |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - u, where u is the number of people who only own C.

Then, we expressed |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| as:

(x + y + d) + (w + y + d) + (z + y + d) = x + w + z + 3y + 3d.

Since x + w + z =437 (exactly two of D, G, S), and y=234 (exactly three), we had:

437 + 3*234 + 3d = 437 + 702 +3d = 1139 +3d.

Then, |D∩G∩S| is the number of people who own all three of D, G, S, which includes those who own exactly three (y) and those who own all four (d), so |D∩G∩S|= y +d.

Substituting into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 - u = 1124 - (1139 +3d) + (y +d).

Wait, 1124 minus (1139 +3d) is 1124 -1139 -3d = -15 -3d.

Adding (y +d) gives: -15 -3d + y +d = -15 -2d + y.

So,

900 -u = -15 -2d + y.

But y=234, so:

900 -u = -15 -2d +234 = 219 -2d.

Then, from the earlier equation, a + d =229, and a is the number of people owning exactly one item, which is only C, which is u. So, a =u.

Thus, u =229 -d.

Substituting into 900 -u = 219 -2d:

900 - (229 -d) = 219 -2d.

Calculating:

900 -229 +d = 671 +d.

Right side: 219 -2d.

So,

671 +d = 219 -2d.

Bringing like terms together:

d +2d = 219 -671,

3d = -452,

d = -452/3 ≈ -150.666...

This can't be right because d can't be negative. So, I must have made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Let me check my assumptions again. Maybe I messed up the relations between the intersection counts and the exactly two, three, and four categories.

Wait, perhaps |D∩G∩S| is not y +d. Let me think again. Since y is the number of people who own exactly three of D, G, S, which, considering that everyone owns C, would be owning all three plus C, making it exactly four items. So, in the three-set context (D, G, S), |D∩G∩S| includes all people who own all three, regardless of whether they own other things beyond that. But in our case, the only other thing is C, which everyone owns. So, |D∩G∩S| would be the number of people who own D, G, and S, plus C, which is exactly the same as the number of people who own all four items (d) plus the number who own exactly three (y). Wait, no, because if someone owns exactly three of D, G, S, they're actually owning all three plus C, which makes it four items, so they are in the 'exactly four' category, which is d. So perhaps y is zero?

Wait, that can't be right because the problem states that 234 own exactly three of these things, which would include C. So y is 234, and |D∩G∩S| would be y +d, as I thought earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me re-express the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion for all four items. Since C is universal, perhaps that's complicating things, but let's try.

The four-item inclusion-exclusion formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|.

But since C is universal, |D∩C| = |D|, |G∩C|=|G|, |S∩C|=|S|.

Similarly, |D∩G∩C|=|D∩G|, |D∩S∩C|=|D∩S|, |G∩S∩C|=|G∩S|.

And |D∩G∩S∩C|=|D∩G∩S|.

So substituting all these, the formula becomes:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D| - |G∩S| - |G| - |S| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|.

Wait, that looks complicated, but perhaps some terms cancel out.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Sum of single sets: |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = let's compute:

195 + 367 = 562,

562 + 562 = 1124,

1124 + 900 = 2024.

Now, subtract the pairwise intersections:

- |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D| - |G∩S| - |G| - |S|.

Wait, so that's:

- (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |D| + |G∩S| + |G| + |S|).

Hmm, that's a lot.

Then, add the triple intersections:

+ |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|.

And then subtract the four-way intersection:

- |D∩G∩S|.

Wait, let's write it all out:

2024 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |D| + |G∩S| + |G| + |S|) + (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) - |D∩G∩S|.

Now, let's see if terms cancel:

Looking at the terms:

- |D∩G| from the first subtraction,

+ |D∩G| from the triple intersections,

so they cancel.

Similarly, - |D∩S| and + |D∩S| cancel.

Same with - |G∩S| and + |G∩S|.

So what's left?

The other terms:

- |D| - |G| - |S| + |D∩G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|.

Wait, because the subtraction of the four-way intersection is - |D∩G∩S|.

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, let's re-express:

After cancellation, the expression becomes:

2024 - |D| - |G| - |S| + |D∩G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|.

Because:

- |D∩G|, - |D∩S|, - |G∩S| each cancel with + |D∩G|, etc., but the other terms are:

- |D|, - |G|, - |S|, + |D∩G∩S|, and then - |D∩G∩S|.

So:

2024 - |D| - |G| - |S| + |D∩G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| = 2024 - |D| - |G| - |S|.

But |D| + |G| + |S| =195 +367 +562=1124.

So, 2024 -1124=900.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| =900.

Which makes sense because everyone is in C, so the union is 900.

But that doesn't give us any new information, which suggests that this approach isn't helping.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of people in each category.

We know that:

Total = a + b + c + d =900,

where a is the number of people owning exactly one item (only C),

b=437 (exactly two),

c=234 (exactly three),

d is all four.

So, a =900 -437 -234 -d = 900-671 -d= 229 -d.

Now, the sum of the sizes of the individual sets is:

|D| + |G| + |S| =195 +367 +562=1124.

But each of these counts includes people in multiple categories.

Each person in exactly two items contributes to two of these counts.

Each person in exactly three items contributes to three of these counts.

Each person in all four items contributes to all three sets, but since C is universal, perhaps the counts for D, G, S include those in all four.

Wait, no. |D| is the number of people owning D, which includes those who own D and only C, those who own D and another item, etc.

So, perhaps the sum |D| + |G| + |S| can be expressed in terms of the counts a, b, c, d.

Let me think: 

Each person owning exactly one item (only C) doesn't contribute to |D|, |G|, or |S|.

Each person owning exactly two items (e.g., D and C) contributes to |D|,

Similarly, a person owning exactly two items D and G (and C) would contribute to both |D| and |G|.

Similarly, a person owning exactly three items (e.g., D, G, S, and C) would contribute to |D|, |G|, and |S|.

And a person owning all four (which is the same as owning all three D, G, S and C) would contribute to all three.

So, the sum |D| + |G| + |S| can be expressed as:

sum = (number owning exactly D) + (number owning exactly D and G) + (number owning exactly D and S) + (number owning exactly D, G, and S) + (number owning all four) 

+ (number owning exactly G) + (number owning exactly G and S) + (number owning exactly G, D, and S) + (number owning all four)

+ (number owning exactly S) + (number owning exactly S and D) + (number owning exactly S and G) + (number owning exactly S, D, G) + (number owning all four).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better way is to realize that each person in exactly two items contributes to two of the sets, each person in exactly three contributes to three, and each person in all four contributes to three as well (since C is universal, but in the counts of D, G, S, they are included in all three).

Wait, perhaps I can model this as:

sum = (number of people in exactly one of D, G, S) *1 + (number in exactly two) *2 + (number in exactly three) *3 + (number in all four) *3.

But wait, no. Because the people in exactly two of D, G, S contribute to two of the sets D, G, S. Similarly, those in exactly three contribute to all three, and those in all four also contribute to all three because C is universal.

But in our case, since everyone owns C, the sets D, G, S are subsets of C, so their intersections are overlapping within C.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

sum = (number owning exactly D) + (number owning exactly G) + (number owning exactly S) + 2*(number owning exactly D and G) + 2*(number owning exactly D and S) + 2*(number owning exactly G and S) + 3*(number owning exactly D, G, S) +3*(number owning all four).

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can model it as:

sum = a_d + a_g + a_s + 2*(b_dg + b_ds + b_g_s) + 3*(c_dgs + d).

Where:

- a_d is the number owning exactly D,

- a_g: exactly G,

- a_s: exactly S,

- b_dg: exactly D and G,

- b_ds: exactly D and S,

- b_g_s: exactly G and S,

- c_dgs: exactly D, G, S,

- d: all four.

But since C is universal, the 'exactly D' would mean only D and C, not owning G or S.

Similarly, exactly two would be D and G and C, etc.

So, let's define:

a_d: exactly D and C → contributes to |D|,

a_g: exactly G and C → contributes to |G|,

a_s: exactly S and C → contributes to |S|,

b_dg: exactly D, G, and C → contributes to both |D| and |G|,

b_ds: exactly D, S, and C → contributes to |D| and |S|,

b_g_s: exactly G, S, and C → contributes to |G| and |S|,

c_dgs: exactly D, G, S, and C → contributes to |D|, |G|, |S|,

d: same as c_dgs, since all four includes C. Wait, no. Wait, if someone owns all four, that's D, G, S, and C, which is the same as exactly three of D, G, S plus C. So, in terms of the counts, 'exactly three' would be D, G, S, and C, which is the same as the 'all four' category. So, perhaps c_dgs = d.

Wait, no. Wait, in the problem statement, exactly three refers to exactly three of the four items, including C. So, if someone owns exactly three, that includes C plus two others. But in our case, the three others are D, G, S. So, someone owning exactly three would have C plus two of D, G, S. So, in the three-set context (D, G, S), this would be owning exactly two of them, but since C is always present, perhaps that's where the counts are getting mixed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to express the sum |D| + |G| + |S|.

Each person in exactly one of D, G, S contributes 1 to the sum.

Each person in exactly two of D, G, S contributes 2 to the sum.

Each person in exactly three of D, G, S contributes 3 to the sum.

Each person in all four contributes 3 to the sum as well (since they are in all three of D, G, S).

Wait, but in reality, the sum |D| + |G| + |S| equals:

(number of people in exactly D) + (number in exactly G) + (number in exactly S) + 2*(number in exactly D and G) + 2*(number in exactly D and S) + 2*(number in exactly G and S) + 3*(number in exactly D, G, S) +3*(number in all four).

But wait, no. Because the 'exactly D' would be people who own D and C but not G or S, so they contribute 1 to |D|.

Similarly, 'exactly D and G' (but not S) would contribute 1 to |D| and 1 to |G|, so overall 2.

Similarly, 'exactly D, G, S' would contribute 1 to each, so 3.

And 'all four' (which is exactly D, G, S, and C) would contribute 1 to each of D, G, S, so 3.

So, the sum:

sum = [a_d + a_g + a_s] + 2*[b_dg + b_ds + b_g_s] + 3*[c_dgs + d].

But I don't know a_d, a_g, a_s, b_dg, etc.

Wait, but I know that the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is 437, which is the sum of b_dg + b_ds + b_g_s =437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of D, G, S is 234, which is c_dgs =234.

And the number of people owning all four is d.

Wait, but in the three-set context, c_dgs is the number of people owning exactly three of D, G, S, which is 234. But in reality, since everyone owns C, owning exactly three would be owning D, G, S, and C, which is the same as d. So, perhaps c_dgs =d=234? No, that can't be because d is the number of people owning all four, which is exactly three of D, G, S plus C, which is exactly four items.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, 'exactly three' refers to exactly three of the four items, including C. So, someone owning exactly three would have two of D, G, S plus C. So, in the three-set context (D, G, S), they would be owning exactly two of them, because they also own C.

This is getting really confusing. Let me try a different approach.

We have:

sum = |D| + |G| + |S| = (a_d + b_dg + b_ds + c_dgs + d) + (a_g + b_dg + b_g_s + c_dgs + d) + (a_s + b_ds + b_g_s + c_dgs + d).

Simplifying:

Each term:

|D| = a_d (only D) + b_dg (D and G) + b_ds (D and S) + c_dgs (D, G, S) + d (all four).

Similarly,

|G| = a_g (only G) + b_dg (D and G) + b_g_s (G and S) + c_dgs (D, G, S) + d.

|S| = a_s (only S) + b_ds (D and S) + b_g_s (G and S) + c_dgs (D, G, S) + d.

So sum:

sum = [a_d + b_dg + b_ds + c_dgs + d] +

       [a_g + b_dg + b_g_s + c_dgs + d] +

       [a_s + b_ds + b_g_s + c_dgs + d].

Adding these up:

sum = (a_d + a_g + a_s) + 2*(b_dg + b_ds + b_g_s) + 3*(c_dgs) + 3*d.

We know that:

a_d + a_g + a_s = a, which is the number of people owning exactly one item (only C plus one of D, G, S).

b_dg + b_ds + b_g_s = b =437.

c_dgs = 234.

And d is what we're trying to find.

So,

sum = a + 2*b + 3*c_dgs +3*d.

But sum is also 195 +367 +562 =1124.

So,

1124 = a + 2*437 + 3*234 +3d.

Compute:

2*437=874,

3*234=702,

So,

1124 = a + 874 +702 +3d.

Adding 874 +702: 1576.

So,

1124 = a +1576 +3d.

Rearranging,

a +3d =1124 -1576 = -452.

But earlier, we had a +d =229.

So now we have two equations:

1) a + d =229,

2) a +3d =-452.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(a +3d) - (a +d) = -452 -229,

2d = -681,

d= -681/2 = -340.5.

This is impossible because the number of people can't be negative. So, I must have made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the way I defined the exactly three and all four categories. Let me double-check.

The problem says 234 residents own exactly three of the four items. Since C is always owned, exactly three would mean owning C plus two of D, G, S. So, in the three-set context (D, G, S), these people own exactly two of them. So, the number of people owning exactly three items (including C) is 234, which in the three-set context would be the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, plus C. So, in the three-set context, |D∩G| includes these people as well as those who own all three of D, G, S.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me consider that the sum |D| + |G| + |S| counts:

- Each person owning exactly D: contributes 1,

- Each person owning exactly D and G: contributes 2,

- Each person owning exactly D and S: contributes 2,

- Each person owning exactly D, G, and S: contributes 3,

- Each person owning all four: contributes 3.

Similarly for G and S.

So, the sum is:

sum = (a_d + a_g + a_s) + 2*(b_dg + b_ds + b_g_s) + 3*(c_dgs + d).

We know:

a_d + a_g + a_s = a,

b_dg + b_ds + b_g_s =b=437,

c_dgs +d = ?

Wait, no, because c_dgs is the number of people owning exactly three of D, G, S, which in the four-item context would be exactly two (since they have C and two others). So perhaps c_dgs = 234? No, wait, the problem says 234 own exactly three of the four items, which includes C. So, in the three-set context, these people own exactly two of D, G, S. So, |D∩G| in the three-set context includes these people plus those who own all three (c_dgs) plus those who own all four (d). Or is it different?

This is getting too complicated. Let me try using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, considering that C is universal.

Wait, but since C is universal, any intersection involving C is the same as the other set. So, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion formula can be adjusted.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of the sizes of the sets:

sum |A_i| = sum_{i} |A_i| - sum_{i<j} |A_i ∩ A_j| + sum_{i<j<k} |A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| - |A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4|.

In this case, the four sets are D, G, S, C. But since C includes everyone, the last term is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|= |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the total number of elements in four sets:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|.

But since C is universal, |A ∩ C|=|A| for any set A.

So,

|D ∩ C|=|D|=195,

|G ∩ C|=|G|=367,

|S ∩ C|=|S|=562,

Similarly,

|D ∩ G ∩ C|=|D ∩ G|,

|D ∩ S ∩ C|=|D ∩ S|,

|G ∩ S ∩ C|=|G ∩ S|,

|D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|=|D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So, substituting into the formula:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| 

- (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |D| + |G∩S| + |G| + |S|)

+ (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|)

- |D∩G∩S|.

Simplify:

= |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| 

- |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D| - |G∩S| - |G| - |S| 

+ |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| 

- |D∩G∩S|.

Now, let's see which terms cancel:

- |D∩G| cancels with + |D∩G|,

- |D∩S| cancels with + |D∩S|,

- |G∩S| cancels with + |G∩S|,

So, remaining terms:

= |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| 

- |D| - |G| - |S| 

+ |D∩G∩S| 

- |D∩G∩S|.

Simplify:

= |C|.

Which is 900, as expected, because the union is everyone in C.

Hmm, so that approach doesn't help either.

I think I'm stuck and perhaps I should look for another method. Maybe using the principle that the sum of the sizes of the sets equals the sum over each element's count.

Wait, another approach: Let's denote:

Let x be the number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S (and C),

y be the number who own exactly three of D, G, S (and C),

z be the number who own all four (D, G, S, and C).

Wait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, x=437, y=234, and z is what we're looking for.

Each person in exactly two contributes 2 to the sum |D| + |G| + |S|,

each in exactly three contributes 3,

each in exactly four contributes 3.

So, the sum |D| + |G| + |S| = 2x + 3y + 3z.

But we know |D| + |G| + |S|=195 +367 +562=1124.

So,

1124 = 2*437 +3*234 +3z.

Calculate:

2*437=874,

3*234=702,

So,

1124=874 +702 +3z.

874 +702=1576,

So,

1124=1576 +3z,

3z=1124-1576= -452,

z= -452/3 ≈-150.666...

Which is impossible because z can't be negative.

So, something's wrong here. I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, I think the mistake is that when someone owns exactly two of D, G, S, they contribute to two of the sets, but when they own exactly three, they contribute to three, and when they own all four, they also contribute to three.

But perhaps the formula should be:

sum |D| + |G| + |S| = (number owning exactly one of D, G, S) *1 + (number owning exactly two) *2 + (number owning exactly three) *3 + (number owning exactly four) *3.

Wait, but in the problem, the number owning exactly two is 437, exactly three is 234, and exactly four is d.

But also, the number owning exactly one of D, G, S is a =229 -d, as we had earlier.

So,

sum |D| + |G| + |S| = (a)*1 + (437)*2 + (234)*3 + d*3.

Which is:

sum = a + 874 +702 +3d.

We know sum=1124,

so,

a +874 +702 +3d=1124,

a + 1576 +3d=1124,

a +3d=1124 -1576= -452.

But from earlier, a +d=229,

so,

a=229 -d.

Substituting into the equation:

229 -d +3d= -452,

229 +2d= -452,

2d= -452 -229= -681,

d= -681/2= -340.5.

Which is impossible. So, clearly, I've made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the definition of exactly three is wrong. If someone owns exactly three of the four items, that would be three of D, G, S plus C, which is exactly four items. So, the problem's 'exactly three' refers to three of the four items, including C. So, in the three-set context (D, G, S), these people own exactly two of them, because they also have C. So, perhaps the 234 are part of the exactly two category in the three-set context.

Wait, that can't be right because the problem says 234 own exactly three of the four items, which includes C.

So, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but the problem is that the sum |D| + |G| + |S| must be greater than or equal to the total number of people owning any of D, G, S, which is 900 - u, where u is the number owning only C.

But I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should try looking for another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when considering the three-set inclusion-exclusion, the formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

And this is equal to 900 - u, where u is the number of people owning only C.

But then, the sum |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 +367 +562=1124.

So,

1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|=900 -u.

But we can also express |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S| in terms of the exactly two and exactly three and all four.

Each |D∩G| includes:

- People owning exactly D and G (which is part of the exactly two category, 437),

- People owning exactly D, G, and S (which is part of the exactly three category, 234),

- People owning all four, which is d.

So,

|D∩G|= x + y + d,

where x is the number of people owning exactly D and G (part of the 437),

y is the number owning exactly D, G, and S (part of the 234),

and d is the number owning all four.

Wait, but the 437 is the total number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S. So, perhaps |D∩G| = x + y + d,

where x is the number owning exactly D and G,

y is the number owning exactly D, G, and S,

and d is the number owning all four.

But the 437 is the sum of x (D and G), w (D and S), z (G and S).

So,

x + w + z=437,

and y=234,

|D∩G|=x + y + d,

|D∩S|=w + y + d,

|G∩S|=z + y + d.

Thus, sum of |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|= (x + y +d) + (w + y +d) + (z + y +d) = x + w + z + 3y +3d=437 + 3*234 +3d.

Which is 437 +702 +3d=1139 +3d.

And |D∩G∩S|= y + d,

since y is exactly three and d is all four.

So, substituting back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 - u=1124 - (1139 +3d) + (y +d),

which is,

900 -u=1124 -1139 -3d +y +d= -15 -2d + y.

Since y=234,

900 -u= -15 -2d +234=219 -2d.

But,

u is the number of people owning only C, which is the same as a.

And from earlier,

a +d=229,

so,

a=229 -d,

so,

u=229 -d.

Substituting into the equation:

900 - (229 -d)=219 -2d,

671 +d=219 -2d,

671 -219= -3d,

452= -3d,

d= -452/3≈-150.666...

Which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake in how I'm defining the intersections.

I think the root of the problem is that the way I'm relating the intersections to the exactly two, exactly three, and all four counts is incorrect. Maybe I'm missing something in the inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have a negative number, implying that my approach is wrong. But that can't be, so perhaps I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, perhaps the answer is zero. Because the sum of the given numbers exceeds 900, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is 150, which is 452/3, but since 452 divided by 3 is approximately 150.666, and since the number of people must be an integer, maybe it's 151. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try using the principle that the sum of the sizes of the individual sets equals the sum over the number of people owning exactly one, two, three, or four items, each multiplied by how many sets they are in.

So,

sum |D| + |G| + |S| = (number owning exactly D) *1 + (number owning exactly G)*1 + (number owning exactly S)*1 

+ (number owning exactly D and G)*2 + (number owning exactly D and S)*2 + (number owning exactly G and S)*2 

+ (number owning exactly D, G, S)*3 + (number owning all four)*3.

Which can be written as:

sum = a_d + a_g + a_s + 2*(b_dg + b_ds + b_g_s) +3*(c_dgs +d).

We know that:

a_d + a_g + a_s = a,

b_dg + b_ds + b_g_s=437,

c_dgs=234,

d is the number of people owning all four.

So,

sum = a + 2*437 +3*(234 +d).

But sum is 1124,

so,

1124= a + 874 +702 +3d.

Which simplifies to:

1124 = a +1576 +3d,

so,

a +3d=1124-1576= -452.

But a +d=229,

so,

a=229 -d,

substituting:

229 -d +3d= -452,

229 +2d= -452,

2d= -681,

d= -340.5.

Which is impossible.

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe the answer is 151, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data:

- Total residents: 900.
- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195.
- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367.
- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562.
- Residents owning exactly two items: 437.
- Residents owning exactly three items: 234.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C), making it a universal set.

### Key Steps:

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( a \) be the number of residents owning exactly one item (only C).
   - Let \( b = 437 \) be the number of residents owning exactly two items.
   - Let \( c = 234 \) be the number of residents owning exactly three items.
   - Let \( d \) be the number of residents owning all four items.

2. **Total Residents Equation**:
   \[
   a + b + c + d = 900
   \]
   Substituting \( b \) and \( c \):
   \[
   a + 437 + 234 + d = 900 \implies a + d = 229
   \]

3. **Sum of Individual Sets**:
   The sum of the sizes of the individual sets \( |D| + |G| + |S| \) is:
   \[
   195 + 367 + 562 = 1124
   \]

4. **Express Sum in Terms of Exactly k Items**:
   Each resident contributes to the sum based on how many items they own:
   - Residents owning exactly one item contribute 1.
   - Residents owning exactly two items contribute 2.
   - Residents owning exactly three items contribute 3.
   - Residents owning all four items contribute 3.

   Thus:
   \[
   1124 = a + 2b + 3c + 3d
   \]
   Substituting \( b = 437 \) and \( c = 234 \):
   \[
   1124 = a + 2(437) + 3(234) + 3d
   \]
   \[
   1124 = a + 874 + 702 + 3d
   \]
   \[
   1124 = a + 1576 + 3d
   \]
   \[
   a + 3d = 1124 - 1576 = -452
   \]

5. **Solve the System of Equations**:
   From \( a + d = 229 \), express \( a \) as:
   \[
   a = 229 - d
   \]
   Substitute into \( a + 3d = -452 \):
   \[
   229 - d + 3d = -452
   \]
   \[
   229 + 2d = -452
   \]
   \[
   2d = -681
   \]
   \[
   d = -\frac{681}{2} = -340.5
   \]

   Since the number of residents cannot be negative, this result indicates an inconsistency in the problem setup or assumptions.

### Conclusion:
The calculations lead to a negative number of residents, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem's data or in the interpretation of the categories. However, based on the calculations, the number of residents owning all four items is:

\boxed{-340.5}

(Note: The negative result suggests a problem in the data or assumptions, but as per the instructions, we provide the calculated result.)
