Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It's about rectangular boxes with a specific surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q and find p+q. Hmm, seems a bit involved, but let's break it down.

First, the problem mentions the set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. So, for any box in B, the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. The radius of this sphere will be the same for all such boxes, right? Because the sphere needs to contain any box from B, so we're looking for the maximum possible distance from the center of the sphere to any corner of the box. That distance will determine the radius.

Wait, no, actually, the sphere has to contain the entire box. So the sphere must enclose the box such that every point in the box is within the sphere. So the sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance within the box, stretching from one corner to the opposite corner. Hence, the sphere's diameter must be at least equal to the space diagonal, so the radius is half of that.

So, if I can find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, then the radius r would be half of that. Therefore, r squared would be (d^2)/4, where d is the maximum space diagonal.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum space diagonal of a rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, r squared is (d^2)/4, and I need to express that as p/q.

Let me formalize this. Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, z. Then:

Surface area S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54.

Volume V = xyz = 23.

Space diagonal d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²).

We need to maximize d², which is x² + y² + z², given the constraints on S and V.

So, the problem is to maximize x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express two variables in terms of the third using the given constraints and then maximize the expression.

Let me think about it. Let's fix one variable, say x, and try to express y and z in terms of x.

But wait, that might get complicated because of the two constraints. Maybe I can use the method of symmetric variables or assume some symmetry.

Wait, but the box doesn't have to be a cube, right? So perhaps the maximum space diagonal occurs when the box is not a cube. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but to maximize x² + y² + z², given fixed surface area and volume, I think that the maximum occurs when the box is as "stretched" as possible in one direction, making one dimension as large as possible and the others as small as possible, but constrained by the surface area and volume.

But that's just a hunch. Maybe I should set up the equations.

So, we have:

Equation 1: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27.

Equation 2: xyz = 23.

We need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z².

Let me denote S1 = x + y + z, S2 = xy + yz + zx = 27, S3 = xyz = 23.

We also know that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx) ⇒ S1² = (x² + y² + z²) + 2*27 ⇒ x² + y² + z² = S1² - 54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize S1². So, maximize S1.

Hmm, so the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of S1 = x + y + z, given that S2 = 27 and S3 = 23.

Wait, but is that correct? Because if I can find the maximum of S1, then I can get the maximum x² + y² + z².

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use the inequality between
