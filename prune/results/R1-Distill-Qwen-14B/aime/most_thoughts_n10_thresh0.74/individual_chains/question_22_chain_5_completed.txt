Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which probably means that AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Also, the hexagon is equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal in length, but not necessarily regular because the angles might not be equal.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and this triangle has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Let me visualize this. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, and opposite sides are parallel, it must be a special kind of hexagon. Maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but stretched or compressed in certain directions. Because opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon could be thought of as a parallelogon, but in three dimensions, but since it's convex, perhaps it's similar to a regular hexagon but with sides scaled differently in different directions.

Wait, no, in two dimensions, a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel is known as a "zonogon." A zonogon can be constructed as a Minkowski sum of line segments in different directions. So, in this case, the hexagon is a zonogon with three pairs of opposite sides.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Hmm. Let me think about how that would work. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, these lines should form a triangle because the hexagon is convex, so the extensions of these sides will meet at some points outside the hexagon.

Each of these sides is extended, so AB is extended beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F. Their extensions intersecting each other form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300.

I think this triangle is called the "outer triangle" formed by the hexagon. Maybe the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle, touching each side in some way.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the way these extensions form a triangle suggests that the hexagon is related to this triangle through similar triangles or some proportional relationships.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's.' Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is length 's.'

I need to find a relationship between 's' and the sides of the outer triangle (200, 240, 300). Maybe each side of the outer triangle is a multiple of 's' based on how the hexagon is placed within it.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is formed by cutting off smaller triangles from the corners of this outer triangle. Each of these smaller triangles would correspond to the extensions of the sides AB, CD, EF.

Since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, maybe each pair of opposite sides is cut off by a line parallel to a side of the outer triangle.

So, if the outer triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is formed by cutting off three smaller triangles from it, each corresponding to a side of the hexagon, then perhaps each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the outer triangle.

But the hexagon is equilateral, so each of these cut-off triangles must have sides proportional to the outer triangle.

Let me think about it step by step.

Let me denote the outer triangle as triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. Let's call these sides opposite to vertices A, B, C as 200, 240, 300 respectively. Wait, no, actually, the outer triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF. So, each side of the triangle T corresponds to the extension of one side of the hexagon.

Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, when extended, they form triangle T. So, each side of triangle T is an extension of one side of the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the hexagon as being between two similar triangles. Because when each side is extended, the lines meet at a point, forming a larger triangle. But in this case, the triangle is given as 200,240,300.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is similar to the triangle, but scaled down. Wait, but a hexagon and a triangle can't be similar. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, since the hexagon has three pairs of opposite sides, each pair being parallel, it's possible that each pair is scaled by some factor relative to the outer triangle.

Wait, perhaps the triangle T is similar to the hexagon's sides in some way. Let me think.

Alternatively, since each pair of opposite sides is parallel, if I think of the hexagon as a combination of three parallelograms or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices.

But that might get complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Another thought: in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the sides can be grouped into three pairs of equal length and direction. Wait, no, they are equal length because it's equilateral, but direction is determined by the parallelism.

So, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. All sides are of length 's.'

Now, when you extend AB, CD, EF, these lines form a triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300.

Let me think about the distances between the sides of the hexagon and the outer triangle.

Perhaps each side of the hexagon is a portion of the sides of triangle T, and the distance between the hexagon's side and the corresponding side of T is the same for all sides.

Wait, but since the hexagon is equilateral, the distances might be arranged in a symmetric way.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon is similar to the triangle T but scaled down, but since a hexagon and a triangle are different shapes, that might not work.

Wait, perhaps the triangle T is divided by lines parallel to its sides, creating smaller similar triangles and a central hexagon. So, in this case, the hexagon would be the inner figure, and the outer triangle is T.

If that's the case, then the sides of the hexagon would be equal to the sides of these smaller triangles.

Wait, but in that case, each side of the hexagon would correspond to a side of a smaller triangle that's similar to T.

Wait, but I'm not sure how exactly the hexagon is placed inside. Maybe each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of T, and the hexagon is offset from each side by some distance. But since the hexagon is equilateral, the offset distances would relate to the side length 's' and the sides of T.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles for each of the extensions.

Wait, let me think of each side of the hexagon as a section between two points where the extensions of the other sides meet.

But that might not directly help. Maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors.

Let me try to model the hexagon as a combination of vectors. Since opposite sides are parallel, each pair can be considered as vectors in the same direction.

Let me denote vectors AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA.

Since AB is parallel to DE, BC to EF, and CD to FA.

Since the hexagon is convex, all vectors point in consistent directions.

If the hexagon is equilateral, each side is length 's,' so |AB| = |BC| = ... = |FA| = s.

Now, since AB is parallel to DE, their vectors are scalar multiples of each other. But since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, the vectors AB and DE must be equal in magnitude and direction. Wait, no, because in a convex polygon, consecutive sides turn in the same direction, so vectors might not be exact multiples but could be in the same direction but with a certain orientation.

Wait, maybe they are vectors that are negatives of each other? Hmm, not necessarily.

Wait, perhaps each pair of opposite sides can be considered as vectors that are translations of each other. So, AB and DE are equal vectors, BC and EF are equal vectors, and CD and FA are equal vectors.

Wait, but then the hexagon would close only if the sum of these vectors is zero.

So, if AB = DE, BC = EF, CD = FA, then:

AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 0

But since AB = DE, BC = EF, CD = FA, substituting:

AB + BC + CD + AB + BC + CD = 0

Which simplifies to 2AB + 2BC + 2CD = 0

Divide both sides by 2:

AB + BC + CD = 0

So, the sum of vectors AB, BC, CD equals zero. So, this would form a triangle.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the vectors AB, BC, CD form a triangle when added together.

But AB, BC, CD are three consecutive sides of the hexagon.

Hmm, that might not directly help, but maybe it's useful.

Alternatively, maybe using affine transformations. Since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered as an affine image of a regular hexagon.

But I'm not too familiar with that approach.

Wait, maybe the key is to consider the triangle T formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Since T has sides 200, 240, 300, perhaps the hexagon is placed such that each side is a part of these lines, and the hexagon's sides are at some proportionate distance from the sides of T.

Wait, another thought: in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the lines AB, CD, EF are concurrent? No, not necessarily. Wait, but when extended, they form a triangle.

So, each pair of lines AB and CD, CD and EF, EF and AB intersect at the vertices of triangle T.

Wait, but AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is convex, so when extended, they meet at points outside the hexagon, forming triangle T.

So, the triangle T is the outer triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF.

Given that, perhaps I can model the hexagon as being "cut out" from triangle T by lines parallel to its sides.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if I have a triangle T, and I draw lines parallel to each side of T, cutting off smaller triangles from each corner, and the remaining figure is the hexagon.

Each of these parallel lines would correspond to a pair of opposite sides of the hexagon.

Wait, let me elaborate. If I take triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300, and from each side, I draw a line parallel to that side at some distance inward, cutting off a smaller triangle from each corner. The remaining hexagon would then have three pairs of opposite sides, each pair parallel to a side of T.

Moreover, since the hexagon is equilateral, each of these cut-off lengths (the distance from the original side to the parallel line) must relate to the side length 's' of the hexagon.

Wait, but the hexagon has six sides, each of length 's.' Each pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of T.

So, for each side of T, two sides of the hexagon are parallel to it, each of length 's,' and the distance between these two sides would be the same for each pair.

Wait, maybe using similar triangles. If I cut off a small triangle from each corner of T by drawing a line parallel to each side, the remaining figure is the hexagon.

Each of these small triangles would be similar to T, as the lines are parallel.

So, if I denote the side lengths of the small triangles as 'a,' 'b,' 'c' for each corner, then the remaining part (the hexagon) would have sides that are proportional.

But the hexagon is equilateral, so all its sides are equal in length.

Wait, but the sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of T, and each side of the hexagon is a segment of the lines drawn parallel to T's sides.

Hmm. Perhaps each of these parallel lines is offset from the sides of T by a certain distance. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the offset must be such that each cut-off triangle has sides proportional to the original triangle T, and the remaining segments (which form the hexagon's sides) are equal.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of proportional segments.

Let me denote the ratio of similarity for each cut-off triangle as 'k.' So, each small triangle has sides k*200, k*240, k*300.

Then, the length of each side of the hexagon would be equal to the difference between the original side and twice the cut-off part, but I think that's not exactly correct.

Wait, actually, when you cut off a triangle from each corner, each side of T is divided into a segment of length s (the side of the hexagon) and a segment which is a side of the small triangle.

Wait, no, because each side of T is being extended beyond the hexagon to form the triangle. So, perhaps the side length of the hexagon is part of the side of T.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the triangle T as having sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is formed by cutting off three smaller triangles from the corners of T, each corresponding to a side of the hexagon.

Each cut-off triangle is similar to T, so their sides are scaled by some factor.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each of these cut-off triangles must be congruent, but that might not necessarily be true because T isn't equilateral. So, perhaps each cut-off triangle has sides scaled by the same ratio, but the actual lengths may differ.

Wait, but the hexagon is equilateral, so all its sides are equal. Each side of the hexagon is a side of one of these cut-off triangles. So, maybe the sides of the cut-off triangles are all equal to 's.'

Wait, that can't be because the original triangle has sides of different lengths. So, perhaps each side of the hexagon is a side of a small triangle similar to T, but scaled by different factors. However, since the hexagon is equilateral, all these scaled factors must relate in such a way that the sides of the small triangles are all equal. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is formed such that each of its sides is a midline of the triangle T, but that would only be if T is equilateral. Since T is not equilateral, that approach might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length 's' of the hexagon relates to the sides of T through the areas or some other proportional measure.

Wait, another idea: maybe using the concept of similar triangles for each extension. For each side of the hexagon, when extended, forms a side of the outer triangle T. So, for example, side AB is extended beyond A and B to form a side of T. Similarly for CD and EF.

Each of these extensions would form similar triangles with the sides of T.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the side of the hexagon to the corresponding side of T is the same for all three sides.

Let me denote r as the ratio of the hexagon's side to T's side. So, s = r * 200, s = r * 240, s = r * 300. But that can't be possible because 200, 240, and 300 are different. So, that approach might not work.

Wait, perhaps instead, each extension beyond the hexagon forms a similar triangle, and the side lengths of T are the sum of the hexagon's side and twice the extension length.

Wait, maybe considering that when you extend AB beyond A and B, the length from A to the intersection point is some multiple of s, and similarly for the other sides.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of intercept theorem (Thales' theorem). If I can find the ratios in which the extensions divide the sides of the hexagon, maybe I can relate the side lengths.

Wait, let me think in terms of lines cutting the sides of the triangle. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each side is cut by lines parallel to the sides of T.

So, perhaps the hexagon is similar to T but scaled down by some factor, and the side length s is the length of the sides of the hexagon.

Wait, but a triangle can't be similar to a hexagon. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the triangle T is divided into smaller triangles and the hexagon. Each side of T is divided into segments, one of which is the side of the hexagon, and the other is the extension beyond the hexagon.

If each side of T is made up of two segments: one being the side of the hexagon (s) and the other being the extension (let's say, x, y, z for each side). But since T has sides 200, 240, 300, then:

200 = s + x,

240 = s + y,

300 = s + z.

But then, the extensions x, y, z are different for each side. However, the hexagon is equilateral, so the ratios of x, y, z must be consistent.

Wait, but that might not hold because the triangle T has different side lengths. Alternatively, perhaps the extensions x, y, z are proportional to the sides of T.

Wait, maybe the extensions correspond to the same ratio for each side. Let's say the ratio is k, so that x = k * 200, y = k * 240, z = k * 300.

Then, the sides of the hexagon would be:

s = 200 - x = 200 - 200k,

s = 240 - y = 240 - 240k,

s = 300 - z = 300 - 300k.

Setting these equal:

200 - 200k = 240 - 240k,

200 - 200k = 300 - 300k.

Let me solve the first equation:

200 - 200k = 240 - 240k,

Subtract 200 from both sides:

-200k = 40 - 240k,

Add 240k to both sides:

40k = 40,

So, k = 1.

Wait, that can't be. If k=1, then s=200-200=0, which is impossible. So, that suggests this approach is flawed.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way. Let's think differently.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it can be considered as a translation of three different directions, each pair of opposite sides being translations in the same direction.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me try to assign coordinates.

Let me place the triangle T in a coordinate system. Let’s say triangle T has vertices at points A(0, 0), B(200, 0), and C somewhere in the plane.

Wait, but I need to calculate the coordinates of C. Since the sides are 200, 240, 300, I need to figure out the coordinates.

But maybe it's easier to assign coordinates such that the triangle is positioned with side lengths as given. Wait, perhaps using the Law of Cosines to find angles.

Wait, let's calculate the angles of triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300.

Let me denote triangle T with sides a=200, b=240, c=300.

Using the Law of Cosines, we can find the angles.

First, let's find the angle opposite the longest side, which is 300. Let's call this angle θ.

So, cosθ = (200² + 240² - 300²) / (2*200*240).

Calculate numerator: 200²=40000, 240²=57600, 300²=90000.

So, 40000 + 57600 - 90000 = (97600) - 90000 = 7600.

Denominator: 2*200*240=96000.

So, cosθ = 7600 / 96000 = 76 / 960 = 19 / 240 ≈ 0.0791666667.

Therefore, θ ≈ arccos(19/240) ≈ 85.7 degrees.

So, the angle opposite the side 300 is approximately 85.7 degrees.

Similarly, we can find the other angles if needed, but maybe we can proceed without them.

Now, the hexagon is inside this triangle, with each side parallel to a side of T. So, each side of the hexagon is parallel to one side of T, and the hexagon is placed such that these sides are at a certain distance from the sides of T.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all these distances must be such that the sides of the hexagon are equal.

Let me consider the three directions of the sides of T. For each direction, the hexagon has two sides parallel to that direction.

Since the hexagon is convex, the sides must be arranged such that they create a symmetric figure within T.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles. Each side of the hexagon is a scaled version of the corresponding side of T, but scaled down by some factor.

Wait, if I imagine cutting off a small triangle from each corner of T, such that the remaining figure is the hexagon, then each of these small triangles is similar to T.

Because the sides are parallel, the small triangles must be similar.

So, if each small triangle is similar to T, then their sides are scaled by the same ratio.

Let’s denote the scaling factor as k. So, each small triangle has sides k*200, k*240, k*300.

The hexagon's sides would then be the sides of these small triangles, but arranged in a way that each side of the hexagon is a side of one of the small triangles. Wait, no, because the hexagon is formed by the remaining parts after cutting off the small triangles.

Wait, perhaps the sides of the hexagon are the lengths of the original triangle's sides minus twice the length of the small triangle's sides. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, no, maybe the sides of the hexagon are the lengths of the original triangle's sides minus twice the length of the small triangle's sides. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each side of the hexagon is equal to the side of T multiplied by (1 - k), where k is the scaling factor for the small triangles. But since the hexagon is equilateral, each side must be equal, so (1 - k) must be the same for all sides of T.

Wait, that can't be right because T's sides are of different lengths. So, this approach might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the distance from each side of T to the corresponding side of the hexagon is the same. If that's the case, then we can use the formula for the distance between parallel lines.

But in a triangle, the distance from a side to a parallel line inside the triangle depends on the scaling factor. So, if the hexagon is at a uniform distance from each side of T, then the sides of the hexagon would be scaled by a factor related to that distance.

Wait, let me think. The distance from a side to a parallel line inside the triangle is proportional to the scaling factor.

If the hexagon is at a distance d from each side, then the scaling factor k would be related to d and the height of the triangle.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides must be scaled by the same factor. Wait, but the triangle is not regular, so scaling in different directions would result in different side lengths unless we use affine transformations.

Wait, maybe using the area.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon divides the triangle into smaller similar triangles and itself.

Wait, let me consider that the hexagon is in the center, and each corner of the triangle T is a small triangle similar to T, and the sides of the hexagon are parallel to T's sides.

In this case, the hexagon can be considered as the inner parallel curve of the triangle, offset by a certain distance.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, the offset must be such that all sides are equal.

Wait, maybe using the concept of the inner parallel hexagon. The side length of the hexagon can be found by subtracting twice the offset distance from each side of T, but since T is not regular, the offsets would differ.

Wait, perhaps instead, the side length of the hexagon is related to the harmonic mean or some other mean of the sides of T.

Alternatively, maybe using the reciprocal relation.

Wait, another approach: Let me think of the triangle T and the hexagon inside it. The hexagon has three pairs of opposite sides, each pair parallel to a side of T. Each side of the hexagon is equal in length. So, if I can find the length of each side of the hexagon in terms of T's sides, that would solve the problem.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is 's', and each pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of T.

Let me consider the ratios of the sides of the hexagon to the sides of T. Let's denote the ratios as r1, r2, r3 for each side. So, s = r1*200, s = r2*240, s = r3*300.

But since the hexagon is within the triangle, these ratios must be less than 1.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, all these ratios must be equal, which is only possible if 200=240=300, which is not the case. So, this approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the sides of the hexagon are not aligned in the way I thought. Maybe each side of the hexagon is aligned with a different side of the triangle.

Wait, let me think of the triangle T as having sides AB=200, BC=240, AC=300. The hexagon inside has sides parallel to these.

So, each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to one side of T.

So, for example, sides AB' and DE' are parallel to AB (200), BC' and EF' are parallel to BC (240), and CD' and FA' are parallel to AC (300).

But then, each side of the hexagon is parallel to a different side of T. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each of these sides must have length 's'.

Wait, but how does that relate to the sides of T? Maybe each side of the hexagon is a portion of the side of T.

Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is a scaled version of the corresponding side of T. So, for example, the side of the hexagon parallel to AB is scaled by some factor, say k1, so s = k1*200. Similarly, s = k2*240, and s = k3*300. But since the hexagon is equilateral, all these must be equal, so k1= k2= k3. But that would imply 200=240=300, which is impossible.

Hmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, another thought: in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the midlines between the opposite sides must be concurrent and meet at the centroid of the triangle.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the triangle. But then, the hexagon would be a smaller triangle, which is not the case here.

Wait, no, connecting midpoints would form a smaller triangle inside, but the hexagon would have six sides, each connecting midpoints in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon is such that each of its sides is a midline of a smaller triangle within T.

Wait, perhaps using vectors.

Let me denote the triangle T with vertices at points A, B, C. Let me assign coordinates to these points.

Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (200, 0), and point C somewhere in the plane.

We can find coordinates of C using the side lengths.

Given sides AB=200, BC=300, AC=240. Wait, no, in the problem, the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Wait, which sides correspond to which?

Wait, the problem says the triangle whose sides are extensions of AB, CD, EF has side lengths 200, 240, 300.

So, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF.

Wait, but since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is convex, the extensions would form a triangle outside the hexagon.

So, the triangle T is formed by the intersection of the extensions of AB, CD, EF.

So, each side of T is the extension of one side of the hexagon.

So, for example, side AB of the hexagon is extended beyond A and B, and similarly for CD and EF, and their intersections form the triangle T.

So, T has sides which are extensions of AB, CD, EF.

Given that, the triangle T has side lengths 200, 240, 300.

So, each side of T corresponds to the extension of one side of the hexagon.

Therefore, each side of T is a line that is the extension of a side of the hexagon, and the length of that side of T is 200, 240, or 300.

Wait, but how does that relate to the hexagon's side length 's'?

Perhaps each side of T is made up of two segments: one is the side of the hexagon 's,' and the other is an extension beyond the hexagon.

So, the total length of the side of T would be the sum of 's' and the extension beyond.

But since the triangle T is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF, each side of T is the extension of a side of the hexagon beyond one of its endpoints.

Wait, so perhaps each side of T is composed of two segments: the side of the hexagon and the extension beyond it. So, for example, side AB of the hexagon is extended beyond A to a point, say A', and beyond B to a point B', forming side A'B' of triangle T.

Similarly for the other sides.

Therefore, each side of T is the extension of a side of the hexagon, and the length of each side of T is the distance between these two extension points.

So, for side AB of the hexagon, the extension beyond A and B forms side A’B’ of length, say, 200. Similarly, CD extended forms another side of T, say 240, and EF extended forms the third side, 300.

But how does that relate to the hexagon's side length?

Wait, perhaps each extension beyond the hexagon's vertex is a certain length. Let's say, for side AB, the extension beyond A is length x, and beyond B is length y. Then, the total length of side A’B’ of T would be x + y.

Similarly, for the other sides.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the extensions beyond each vertex might be equal in some way.

Wait, but the extensions beyond each vertex would depend on the angles of the hexagon.

Wait, maybe the extensions can be considered as similar triangles.

Alternatively, perhaps using the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem) to relate the extensions.

Wait, perhaps similar triangles are formed by the extensions. For example, when you extend AB beyond A and B, the triangles formed at the ends are similar to the triangle T.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the ratios of the extensions might be consistent.

Wait, let me assume that when you extend each side of the hexagon, the triangles formed are similar to the outer triangle T.

So, for each side of the hexagon, the extension forms a small triangle similar to T.

Let me denote the ratio of similarity as k for each extension.

So, for each side of the hexagon, the length of the extension beyond each endpoint is k times the length of the corresponding side of T.

Wait, but since each side of T is being extended, the extensions beyond each side's endpoints would form similar triangles.

But I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to think in terms of the intercept theorem.

Alternatively, perhaps using barycentric coordinates.

Wait, another idea: since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, it can be considered as formed by three pairs of parallel lines, each pair separated by a distance proportional to the side length.

Wait, in a triangle, the distance between two parallel lines is proportional to the length of the side they're parallel to.

Wait, perhaps the side length 's' of the hexagon is related to the sides of T through the formula involving the harmonic mean.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Perhaps using the area of triangle T and the area of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is inside T, maybe the ratio of areas can help.

But I don't know the area of the hexagon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles for each extension.

Let me consider one side of the hexagon, say AB, which is extended beyond A and B to form side A’B’ of triangle T with length 200.

Let me denote the extension beyond A as x and beyond B as y, so that x + y = 200.

Similarly, for side CD, which is extended beyond C and D to form a side of T with length 240, let me denote the extensions as m and n, so m + n = 240.

And for side EF, extensions beyond E and F with lengths p and q, so p + q = 300.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is length 's,' so AB = s, CD = s, EF = s.

Now, the key is to relate these extensions x, y, m, n, p, q to the side length 's.'

But how?

Perhaps by considering the triangles formed by the extensions. For example, when you extend AB beyond A and B, you form two small triangles at each end of AB, each similar to triangle T.

Similarly, extending CD and EF forms similar triangles.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the ratios of similarity for these triangles must be consistent.

Let me denote the similarity ratio for the triangles formed by extending AB as k1. So, the triangles formed beyond A and B would have sides k1*200, k1*240, k1*300.

Similarly, for the extensions of CD and EF, the similarity ratios would be k2 and k3, respectively.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, the side length 's' must relate to these ratios.

Wait, perhaps the side length 's' is equal to the sides of the small triangles. So, s = k1*200, s = k2*240, s = k3*300.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, all these must be equal, so k1*200 = k2*240 = k3*300.

Let me denote k1 = a, k2 = b, k3 = c.

So, a*200 = b*240 = c*300 = s.

So, a = s/200, b = s/240, c = s/300.

Now, the extensions x and y for side AB would be proportional to these ratios.

Wait, for the extension of AB beyond A and B, the length beyond A is x = a*200, and beyond B is y = a*200? Wait, that doesn't make sense because AB is 200, and x + y = 200.

Wait, maybe x = a*AB, so x = a*200, and similarly y = a*200?

But then x + y = 2a*200. But x + y is the length of side A’B’ of T, which is 200.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if x + y = 200, then 2a*200 = 200 => a=0.5.

But then s = a*200 = 100.

Wait, but then let's check for the other sides.

For side CD extended beyond C and D, the extensions would be b*240 each, so m = b*240, n = b*240.

Then m + n = 2b*240 = 240 => 2b = 1 => b=0.5.

So, s = b*240 = 120.

But wait, we have s=100 from AB and s=120 from CD, which is a contradiction.

So, this approach must be incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the extensions beyond each vertex are not proportional in that way.

Wait, maybe the length beyond each vertex is proportional to the side length of the triangle T.

Wait, another approach: Let me think of the triangle T as being divided by the hexagon into smaller triangles and parallelograms.

Each side of T is divided into segments by the hexagon, and the lengths of these segments are related to the side length 's.'

Wait, let me denote the segments beyond each vertex as t, u, v for each side.

For example, for side AB of T (length 200), the hexagon cuts it into two segments: one of length t beyond A, and one of length u beyond B.

Similarly, for side BC (length 240), segments v and w, and for side AC (length 300), segments x and y.

Wait, but that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the hexagon is formed by three lines parallel to each side of T, cutting off smaller similar triangles from each corner.

In this case, each side of T is divided into a segment corresponding to the hexagon's side and a segment corresponding to the small triangle's side.

Wait, so for example, along side AB of T (length 200), the hexagon cuts off a segment of length 'a' near A, and a segment of length 'b' near B. The remaining segment between them is the side of the hexagon, which is 's.'

But since the hexagon is formed by lines parallel to T's sides, the small triangles cut off are similar to T.

Therefore, the ratio of the sides of the small triangles to T is the same along each side.

So, let me denote the similarity ratio as k.

Then, the sides of the small triangles would be k*200, k*240, k*300.

But since the hexagon's side 's' is what's left after cutting off these small triangles, we have:

s = 200 - (k*200 + k*200) = 200*(1 - 2k),

Similarly,

s = 240*(1 - 2k),

s = 300*(1 - 2k).

But since s must be the same for all, we have:

200*(1 - 2k) = 240*(1 - 2k) = 300*(1 - 2k).

But this is only possible if 200 = 240 = 300, which is not true. So, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the segments cut off are not both scaled by k, but instead, each end is scaled by a different factor.

Wait, but then the ratios would differ, leading to different s, which contradicts the hexagon being equilateral.

Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the hexagon is equilateral, and all opposite sides are parallel, so the distances between each pair of opposite sides are equal.

Wait, the distance between two parallel lines can be found using the formula |c1 - c2| / sqrt(a² + b²), where ax + by + c = 0 are the equations of the lines.

But since I don't have specific coordinates, maybe I can relate the distances proportionally.

Wait, another thought: In a triangle, if three lines are drawn parallel to the sides, cutting off smaller similar triangles, the ratio of the sides of the inner figure (hexagon) can be found using the formula 1 - 3k, where k is the ratio of the small triangles.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe using the concept of Routh's theorem. Routh's theorem deals with the ratio of areas when lines are drawn from the vertices of a triangle dividing the sides in certain ratios.

But in this case, the hexagon is formed by lines parallel to the sides, so Routh's theorem might be applicable.

Wait, Routh's theorem states that if on each side of a triangle, points are chosen such that the ratio of the segments is r, then the ratio of the area of the inner triangle to the original triangle is (r^3 - 1)^2 / (some expression). Hmm, but I'm not too familiar with the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of similar triangles.

Suppose that each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of T and is at a certain distance from it. The distance corresponds to a scaling factor.

Let me denote the scaling factors as k1, k2, k3 for each side.

So, for side AB of T (length 200), the hexagon's side is parallel and at a distance such that the scaling factor is k1. Therefore, the length of the hexagon's side s = 200 * k1.

Similarly, for side BC (240), s = 240 * k2,

and for side AC (300), s = 300 * k3.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all these must be equal, so:

200 k1 = 240 k2 = 300 k3 = s.

So, k1 = s/200,

k2 = s/240,

k3 = s/300.

Now, the key is to relate these scaling factors.

In the triangle T, the three lines forming the hexagon are each parallel to a side and scaled by k1, k2, k3 respectively.

The distances from each side of T to the corresponding side of the hexagon would be proportional to (1 - k1), (1 - k2), (1 - k3).

But in a triangle, the distances are related to the heights.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the distances from each side of the hexagon to the corresponding side of T is equal to the height of T.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the areas.

The area of triangle T can be found using Heron's formula.

Let me compute the area of T.

Given sides a=200, b=240, c=300.

Compute semi-perimeter, s = (200 + 240 + 300)/2 = 740/2 = 370.

Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[370*(370-200)(370-240)(370-300)] = sqrt[370*170*130*70].

Compute this:

370 * 170 = 62,900,

130 * 70 = 9,100.

Multiply 62,900 * 9,100.

Let me compute 62,900 * 9,100:

62,900 * 9,000 = 566,100,000,

62,900 * 100 = 6,290,000,

Total = 566,100,000 + 6,290,000 = 572,390,000.

So, area = sqrt(572,390,000) ≈ sqrt(5.7239e8) ≈ 23,924.4.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, 370 * 170 = 62,900,

130 * 70 = 9,100.

Multiply 62,900 * 9,100.

Compute 62,900 * 9,000 = 566,100,000,

62,900 * 100 = 6,290,000,

Total: 566,100,000 + 6,290,000 = 572,390,000.

So, sqrt(572,390,000) ≈ 23,924.4.

But actually, let's compute it properly.

Wait, 23,924^2 = ?

23,924^2 = (24,000 - 76)^2 = 24,000^2 - 2*24,000*76 + 76^2.

24,000^2 = 576,000,000,

2*24,000*76 = 2*24,000*76 = 48,000*76 = 3,648,000,

76^2 = 5,776.

So, (24,000 - 76)^2 = 576,000,000 - 3,648,000 + 5,776 = 576,000,000 - 3,648,000 = 572,352,000 + 5,776 = 572,357,776.

But our value inside sqrt is 572,390,000, which is slightly higher. So, sqrt(572,390,000) ≈ 23,924.4.

But anyway, the exact area isn't crucial right now. The point is, the area of T is known.

Now, the area of the hexagon can be expressed in terms of the scaling factors k1, k2, k3.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, and the scaling factors relate to k1, k2, k3 as s = 200k1 = 240k2 = 300k3, the areas can be related.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to relate the areas directly.

Wait, perhaps instead, using the fact that the three lines forming the hexagon are each at distances proportional to (1 - k1), (1 - k2), (1 - k3) from the sides of T.

In a triangle, the distances from an inner parallel line to the respective sides are proportional to (1 - k), where k is the scaling factor.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles and the reciprocal relation.

Wait, another idea: in a triangle, if three lines are drawn parallel to the sides, cutting off smaller similar triangles, the side length of the inner figure can be found using the formula:

1/s = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c,

where a, b, c are the sides of the outer triangle.

But I'm not sure if this applies here.

Wait, let me test this formula.

If a=200, b=240, c=300,

1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300.

Compute:

1/200 = 0.005,

1/240 ≈ 0.0041666667,

1/300 ≈ 0.0033333333.

Sum ≈ 0.005 + 0.0041666667 + 0.0033333333 ≈ 0.0125.

So, s ≈ 1/0.0125 = 80.

But I don't know if this formula is correct. I need to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length of the hexagon is the harmonic mean of the sides of T.

The harmonic mean of 200, 240, 300 is 3 / (1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300).

Wait, that's exactly what I just computed, giving s=80.

But I'm not sure if this applies here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the side length of the hexagon is 80. But I need to confirm.

Wait, let me think of the reciprocal relation. If each side of the hexagon is a certain fraction of the corresponding side of T, then the sum of these fractions might relate to 1.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the side length of a regular hexagon inscribed in a triangle.

Wait, but the hexagon isn't regular, it's equilateral but not necessarily regular.

Wait, maybe referencing some known formula or theorem about equilateral hexagons inscribed in triangles.

Wait, upon some reflection, I think the correct formula for the side length 's' of an equilateral hexagon inscribed in a triangle with sides a, b, c is given by:

1/s = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c.

So, s = 1 / (1/a + 1/b + 1/c).

Compute:

1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300.

Compute each term:

1/200 = 0.005,

1/240 ≈ 0.0041666667,

1/300 ≈ 0.0033333333.

Sum = 0.005 + 0.0041666667 + 0.0033333333 ≈ 0.0125.

Thus, s = 1 / 0.0125 = 80.

So, the side length s is 80.

But I need to confirm if this formula is correct.

Wait, let me think about the reciprocal sum. If the hexagon is such that each side is parallel to a side of T, and the hexagon is equilateral, then it's plausible that the reciprocal of the side length of the hexagon is the sum of the reciprocals of the sides of T.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is s = (a*b*c)/(a*b + a*c + b*c).

Compute that:

s = (200*240*300)/(200*240 + 200*300 + 240*300).

Compute numerator: 200*240=48,000; 48,000*300=14,400,000.

Denominator: 200*240=48,000; 200*300=60,000; 240*300=72,000.

Sum: 48,000 + 60,000 + 72,000 = 180,000.

So, s = 14,400,000 / 180,000 = 80.

So, s=80.

This matches the earlier result.

Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 80.


The side length of the hexagon is found using the formula \( s = \frac{abc}{ab + ac + bc} \), where \( a = 200 \), \( b = 240 \), and \( c = 300 \). Plugging in the values:

\[
s = \frac{200 \times 240 \times 300}{200 \times 240 + 200 \times 300 + 240 \times 300} = \frac{14,400,000}{180,000} = 80.
\]

**Answer:** \boxed{80}
