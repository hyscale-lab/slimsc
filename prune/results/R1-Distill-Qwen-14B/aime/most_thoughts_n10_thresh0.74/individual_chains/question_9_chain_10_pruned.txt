Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that two logarithmic equations are equal to 10. The equations are log base x of y^x equals 10 and log base y of x^{4y} equals 10. Then, I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but using the change of base formula or properties of logarithms might help. Let me rewrite both equations to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. I know that log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a), so I can rewrite this as x * log_x(y) = 10. That simplifies to log_x(y) = 10 / x. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Wait, no, because log_x(y^x) is equal to x * log_x(y), right? So, x * log_x(y) = 10. That means log_x(y) = 10 / x. Hmm.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same property, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, log_y(x) = 10 / (4y) = 5 / (2y).

Now, I have two expressions: log_x(y) = 10 / x and log_y(x) = 5/(2y). But I also know that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, if log_x(y) = A, then log_y(x) = 1/A. Let me confirm that: yes, because if log_x(y) = A, then x^A = y, so log_y(x) = 1/A. So, that means 10/x and 5/(2y) are reciprocals.

So, (10/x) * (5/(2y)) = 1. Let me compute that: (10 * 5) / (x * 2y) = 1. So, 50 / (2xy) = 1. Simplifying the denominator, 2xy, so 50/(2xy) = 1. That means 25/(xy) = 1, right? Because 50 divided by 2 is 25. So 25/(xy) = 1. Therefore, xy = 25.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So xy is 25? Let me check if that makes sense.

So, if xy =25, then y =25/x. Let me plug that back into the original equations to make sure.

First equation: log_x(y^x) =10. Substituting y=25/x, that becomes log_x( (25/x)^x ) =10. Simplify the inside: (25/x)^x =25^x / x^x = (25/x)^x. Hmm, so log_x of that is equal to 10. Alternatively, I can write log_x(25^x / x^x) = log_x(25^x) - log_x(x^x) = x*log_x(25) - x*log_x(x) = x*log_x(25) - x*1 = x(log_x(25) -1). And this is equal to 10.

So, x(log_x(25) -1) =10.

I can write log_x(25) as log(25)/log(x) using change of base formula, so let me denote log_x(25) = ln(25)/ln(x) for natural logs, but maybe using base 10 is
