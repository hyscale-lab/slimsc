Okay, so I've come across this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time, and the person who takes the last token wins. The question is asking how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, I remember that these types of games often involve something called "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, while a losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Since Alice goes first, Bob can only have a guaranteed win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice. So, I need to figure out for which values of n the starting player (Alice) is in a losing position, meaning Bob can always win.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote a position as losing if the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, I'll start by looking at small n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's consider n from 0 upwards:

- n=0: Well, if there are zero tokens, the game is over, so the player who's supposed to move loses. But in our case, the game starts with n≥1, so maybe n=0 is a losing position by definition.

- n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position.

- n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, that's bad. Alternatively, can the player take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 <4. So, the player can only take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent. But as n=1 is a winning position, the opponent can take it and win. So, n=2 is a losing position? Wait, no. Wait, if the current player takes 1 token from n=2, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, the current player can't force a win. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If n=2, current player takes 1, leaving n=1. The next player can take 1 and win. So, yes, if you're at n=2, you can't force a win because whatever you do, the opponent can win. So, n=2 is a losing position.

Wait, but n=1 is a winning position. So, n=2 is a losing position. Let's proceed.

n=3: The current player can take 1 token, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, the current player can force a win. Therefore, n=3 is a winning position.

n=4: The current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, n=4 is a winning position.

n=5: Let's see. The current player can take 1 token, leaving n=4 (a winning position for the opponent), or take 4 tokens, leaving n=1 (a winning position for the opponent). Wait, does that mean n=5 is a losing position
