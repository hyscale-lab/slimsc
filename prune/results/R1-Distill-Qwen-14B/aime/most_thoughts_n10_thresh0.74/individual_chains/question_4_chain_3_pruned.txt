Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how these types of games work. It sounds like a classic combinatorial game, probably involving the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, I need to determine for which values of n Bob can force a win. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only have a winning strategy if n is a losing position for the first player, which is Alice.

Let me try to model this. Let's consider small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no, wait. If Alice takes 1, n becomes 1, Bob takes the last one and wins. But wait, if Alice takes 1, she leaves Bob with n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win if Alice makes a mistake? No, wait, no. Wait, in this case, Alice is trying to win. So in n=2, Alice can choose to take 1 token, leaving Bob with n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So in that case, Bob would win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4 tokens, but n=2, she can't do that. So Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving Bob with n=1. But n=1 is a winning position for the player whose turn it is. So Bob can take that 1 and win. So Bob would win in n=2. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player.

Wait, wait, maybe I should model it step by step
