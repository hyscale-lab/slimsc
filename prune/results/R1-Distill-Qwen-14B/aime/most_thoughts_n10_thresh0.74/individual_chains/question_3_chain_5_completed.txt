Okay, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. This probability is expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, first, I think I need to figure out the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has already won some prize (which includes winning the grand prize or a smaller prize where only two, three, or four numbers match). 

This sounds like a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize (because if you win the grand prize, you definitely have at least two numbers matching), P(A and B) is just P(A). So, the probability we need is P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B). Let's figure out how to calculate these probabilities.

First, let's understand the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's a combination problem, so the total number of possible sets is C(10,4). I can compute that as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = 210.

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. That's the probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. Since there's only one specific set of four numbers that will do this, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, I need to compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are chosen. To find this, it's easier to compute the probability of the complementary event (winning no prize) and subtracting it from 1.

The complementary event is that fewer than two numbers match, i.e., zero or one number matches. So, let's compute the number of ways that Jen can have 0 or 1 matching numbers.

First, the number of ways to have 0 matching numbers: Jen has picked 4 numbers, and none of them are in the randomly chosen 4. So, the 4 chosen numbers must all be from the remaining 6 numbers in S. The number of ways for this is C(6,4). Calculating that: 6!/(4! * 2!) = 15.

Next, the number of ways to have exactly 1 matching number: We choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 numbers from the other 6. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3). Let's compute that: C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

Adding these together, the total number of ways to have 0 or 1 matching numbers is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways to have at least two matching numbers (and thus win a prize) is the total number of possible outcomes minus the number of ways to have 0 or 1 matching numbers. So, that's C(10,4) - 95 = 210 - 95 = 115.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check that. Because C(10,4) is 210, right? And 15 + 80 is 95. So, 210 - 95 is 115. So, the number of favorable outcomes for event B is 115. Therefore, P(B) is 115 / 210.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me make sure. Alternatively, I could compute the number of ways to have exactly 2, 3, or 4 matching numbers and sum them up. Maybe that would be more accurate.

Exactly. Let's compute the number of ways to have exactly 2, 3, or 4 matching numbers.

- Exactly 4: That's just 1, as before.
- Exactly 3: Choose 3 numbers from Jen's 4, and 1 from the remaining 6. So, C(4,3) * C(6,1). C(4,3) is 4, C(6,1) is 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.
- Exactly 2: Choose 2 from Jen's 4, and 2 from the remaining 6. So, C(4,2) * C(6,2). C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.

Adding these together: 1 (for exactly 4) + 24 (exactly 3) + 90 (exactly 2) = 115. So, that confirms the earlier calculation, that 115 is the number of ways to have at least two matching numbers.

So, P(B) is 115 / 210. Simplify that: 115 divides by 5, gives 23, and 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

And P(A) is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, P(A|B) is 1/115. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, because when computing P(A and B), since A is a subset of B, P(A and B) is just P(A). So, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

But 1 and 115 are coprime, so m is 1, n is 115, so m + n is 116.

Wait, is this correct? Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the probabilities using counts instead of fractions.

Total number of possible outcomes: 210.

Number of ways to win grand prize (A): 1.

Number of ways to win any prize (B): 115.

So, the conditional probability is (number of ways A occurs) / (number of ways B occurs) = 1 / 115. So, yes, that's correct.

But wait, is 115 the correct number for B?

Wait, let's ensure that when we compute the number of ways to have at least two matches, it's 115. Let me recount.

Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90.

Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)=1.

So, 90 +24 +1=115. Yes. So, that's correct.

Therefore, P(A|B)=1/115, which simplifies to 1/115, with m=1, n=115, and m + n=116.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I might have made a mistake in understanding the problem. The problem says she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen four, and wins the grand prize if all four match.

So, the event B is that she has at least two matches, which includes exactly two, exactly three, exactly four.

So, the number of favorable cases for B is 90 +24 +1=115, as computed.

So, the conditional probability is correct.

Hmm, but 1/115 seems low, but given that there are 115 total ways to have at least two matches, and only one of them is the grand prize, it's correct.

So, I think the answer is 1 + 115=116.

Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach it. Maybe using hypergeometric distribution.

The hypergeometric probability of k successes (matches) in n draws (4) from a finite population (10) without replacement, where there are K=4 success states in the population.

Wait, actually, in this case, the total population is 10, with 4 special numbers (Jen's numbers). The number of ways to have exactly k matches is C(4,k)*C(6,4âˆ’k).

Wait, so for k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90.

k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

Which again adds up to 90 +24 +1=115.

So, that's consistent with earlier.

Thus, the conditional probability is 1/115.

So, m=1, n=115, which are coprime, so m+n=116.

Therefore, the answer is 116.


To determine the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize, we use conditional probability. Let \( A \) be the event of winning the grand prize, and \( B \) be the event of winning any prize (at least two matching numbers).

1. **Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:**
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = 210
   \]

2. **Number of ways to win the grand prize (\( A \)):**
   \[
   \text{Only 1 way: all 4 numbers match.} \quad \Rightarrow 1
   \]

3. **Number of ways to win a prize (\( B \)):**
   - **Exactly 2 matches:**
     \[
     \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90
     \]
   - **Exactly 3 matches:**
     \[
     \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24
     \]
   - **Exactly 4 matches:**
     \[
     \binom{4}{4} = 1
     \]
   - **Total ways for \( B \):**
     \[
     90 + 24 + 1 = 115
     \]

4. **Probability of winning the grand prize given a prize was won:**
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), and \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

**Answer:** \(\boxed{116}\)
