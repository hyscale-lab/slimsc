Okay, so I've got this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q. Finally, I have to find p + q where p and q are coprime. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let's break it down.

First, let's recall that for a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are length, width, and height. The volume V is lwh. So we know S = 54 and V = 23.

Now, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is sqrt(l^2 + w^2 + h^2). So the radius r would be d/2, hence r^2 would be (l^2 + w^2 + h^2)/4. So I need to minimize l^2 + w^2 + h^2 given the constraints of surface area and volume.

So, the problem reduces to: minimize l^2 + w^2 + h^2 subject to 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that Lagrange multipliers can be used for such problems, but maybe there's a way to simplify it.

Alternatively, maybe assuming symmetry would help. Since the sphere has to contain the box regardless of its orientation, perhaps the minimal sphere occurs when the box is a cube? Wait, but a cube might not satisfy the surface area and volume constraints.

Wait, hold on. Let's check: if the box were a cube, then all sides are equal, say s. Then surface area would be 6s^2 = 54 => s^2 = 9 => s=3. Then volume would be s^3=27. But our volume is only 23, which is less than 27. So the cube with surface area 54 has a larger volume than 23. So the minimal sphere might not correspond to a cube because our volume is less than that of the cube.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal sphere occurs when the box is as "close to cube-like" as possible, given the constraints. Hmm.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers for the optimization.

Let me denote f(l, w, h) = l^2 + w^2 + h^2, which we need to minimize.

Our constraints are:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54. Let me call this constraint g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) - 54 = 0.

2. lwh = 23. Let me call this constraint h(l, w, h) = lwh - 23 = 0.

So we have two constraints. So we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The Lagrangian would be:

L = l^2 + w^2 + h^2 - λ(2(lw + lh + wh) - 54) - μ(lwh - 23)

We take partial derivatives with respect to l, w, h, set them equal to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂l: 2l - λ(2(w + h)) - μ(wh) = 0
Similarly, ∂L/∂w: 2w - λ(2(l + h)) - μ(lh) = 0
∂L/∂h: 2h - λ(2(l + w)) - μ(lw) = 0

So, we have three equations:

1. 2l = λ(2(w + h)) + μ(wh)
2. 2w = λ(2(l + h)) + μ(lh)
3. 2h = λ(2(l + w)) + μ(lw)

And the two constraints:

4. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
5. lwh = 23

Hmm, this system looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or ratios between l, w, h.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

2w - 2l = λ(2(l + h) - 2(w + h)) + μ(lh - wh)

Simplify:

2(w - l) = λ(2(l - w)) + μ(h(l - w))

Factor out (l - w):

2(w - l) = (l - w)(2λ + μ h)

Note that (w - l) = -(l - w), so:

-2(l - w) = (l - w)(2λ + μ h)

Assuming l ≠ w, we can divide both sides by (l - w):

-2 = 2λ + μ h

Similarly, subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

2h - 2l = λ(2(l + w) - 2(w + h)) + μ(lw - wh)

Simplify:

2(h - l) = λ(2(l - h)) + μ(w(l - h))

Factor out (h - l) = -(l - h):

-2(l - h) = (l - h)(2λ + μ w)

Again, assuming l ≠ h, divide by (l - h):

-2 = 2λ + μ w

So now, from these two results, we have:

-2 = 2λ + μ h

and

-2 = 2λ + μ w

Which implies that μ h = μ w, so either μ = 0 or h = w.

If μ = 0, then from the above equations, -2 = 2λ, so λ = -1.

But let's check if μ = 0. If μ = 0, then from our earlier equations:

From equation 1: 2l = λ(2(w + h))

Similarly, equation 2: 2w = λ(2(l + h))

Equation 3: 2h = λ(2(l + w))

So if λ = -1, then:

2l = -2(w + h) ⇒ l = -(w + h)

But lengths can't be negative, so l = -(w + h) is impossible since l, w, h are positive. So μ cannot be zero, which means h must equal w.

So h = w.

Similarly, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

2h - 2w = λ(2(l + w) - 2(l + h)) + μ(lw - lh)

Simplify:

2(h - w) = λ(2(l + w - l - h)) + μ(l(w - h))

Which becomes:

2(h - w) = λ(2(w - h)) + μ l (w - h)

Factor (h - w) = -(w - h):

-2(w - h) = -2λ(w - h) + μ l (w - h)

Divide both sides by (w - h), assuming w ≠ h, but wait, from earlier we have h = w, so w = h. So this subtraction doesn't give us new information.

So, from earlier, we have that w = h.

So, let's let w = h.

So now, our variables are l, w, w.

So, let's rewrite the constraints.

Surface area: 2(lw + l w + w^2) = 54 ⇒ 2(2lw + w²) = 54 ⇒ 4lw + 2w² = 54.

Volume: l w² = 23.

So, now, we have two equations:

1. 4lw + 2w² = 54
2. l w² = 23

We can solve for l from equation 2: l = 23/(w²)

Substitute into equation 1:

4*(23/(w²))*w + 2w² = 54

Simplify:

4*23/w + 2w² = 54

92/w + 2w² = 54

Multiply both sides by w to eliminate denominator:

92 + 2w³ = 54w

Bring all terms to one side:

2w³ -54w +92 =0

Divide equation by 2:

w³ -27w +46 =0

So we have a cubic equation: w³ -27w +46 =0

We can try to find rational roots. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let's test w=2: 8 -54 +46=0 → 0. So w=2 is a root.

So, we can factor out (w -2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide w³ -27w +46 by (w -2):

Coefficients: 1 (w³), 0 (w²), -27 (w), 46.

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

        2   4  -46

      1  2  -23   0

So, the cubic factors as (w -2)(w² + 2w -23) =0

Thus, the roots are w=2, and solutions to w² +2w -23=0.

Using quadratic formula: w = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

Since w must be positive, w= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈3.898.

So possible w values: w=2 and w≈3.898.

So, let's check both cases.

Case 1: w=2.

Then, l =23/(w²)=23/(4)=5.75.

So, l=5.75, w=2, h=2.

Compute space diagonal squared: l² + w² + h² = (5.75)^2 + 2^2 +2^2 = 33.0625 +4 +4=41.0625.

So, r² would be 41.0625/4 ≈10.265625, which is 131/4 ÷4? Wait, wait, 41.0625 is 41 + 1/16, because 0.0625 =1/16. So 41.0625= 657/16. Then r² = (657/16)/4=657/64.

Case 2: w= -1 + 2√6.

Compute w ≈3.898.

Then, l=23/(w²). Let's compute w².

w = -1 + 2√6 ≈-1+4.898≈3.898.

Compute w²: (3.898)^2≈15.19.

So l≈23/15.19≈1.515.

Compute l² + w² + h². Since h=w, it's l² + 2w².

So, l²≈(1.515)^2≈2.295, and 2w²≈2*(15.19)≈30.38.

Total≈2.295 +30.38≈32.675.

So, in this case, r²≈32.675/4≈8.16875.

Which is lower than case 1.

So, that suggests that the minimal r² occurs when w= -1 + 2√6, l≈1.515.

But wait, perhaps I should compute this exactly.

Let me compute w= -1 + 2√6.

Compute w²: (-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2=1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6.

So, w²=25 -4√6.

Then, l=23/(w²)=23/(25 -4√6).

To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

l=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2]=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify denominator: 529 is 23², so 529=23².

Thus, l= [23*(25 +4√6)]/(23²)= (25 +4√6)/23.

So l=(25 +4√6)/23.

So l is expressed in exact terms.

Now, compute l² + 2w².

First, compute l²:

l² = [(25 +4√6)/23]^2 = (625 + 200√6 + 16*6)/529 = (625 +200√6 +96)/529 = (721 +200√6)/529.

Compute 2w²: 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

So, adding l² + 2w²:

(721 +200√6)/529 +50 -8√6.

Convert 50 and -8√6 to fractions over 529:

50=50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So,

(721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6)/529.

Combine like terms:

721 +26450=27171.

200√6 -4232√6= -4032√6.

So numerator is 27171 -4032√6.

Thus, l² + 2w²=(27171 -4032√6)/529.

Therefore, r²=(l² + w² + h²)/4=(27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have kept w² as 25 -4√6, so l² + 2w² is [(25 +4√6)^2)/23²] + 2*(25 -4√6).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate l² + 2w² using exact terms without decimal approximations.

We have:

l = (25 +4√6)/23

w² =25 -4√6

So, l² = (25 +4√6)^2 / (23^2) = [625 + 200√6 + 96]/529 = (721 + 200√6)/529.

Then, 2w² = 2*(25 -4√6) =50 -8√6.

So, l² + 2w² = (721 +200√6)/529 +50 -8√6.

Express 50 as 50*529/529=26450/529.

Express -8√6 as (-8√6)*529/529= (-4232√6)/529.

So, adding all together:

(721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6)/529.

Calculate numerator:

721 +26450=27171.

200√6 -4232√6= -4032√6.

Thus, numerator is 27171 -4032√6.

So, l² + 2w²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Therefore, r²=(l² + w² + h²)/4= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529).

Compute denominator:4*529=2116.

So, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Hmm, that seems complicated, but perhaps it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in expanding the squares. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed l², I have l=(25 +4√6)/23, so l² is (25 +4√6)^2 /23².

Which is (625 + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2)/529.

Which is (625 + 200√6 + 16*6)/529.

16*6=96. So, 625 +96=721. So that part is correct.

Thus, l²=(721 +200√6)/529.

Then 2w²=2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

So, when adding, yes, we have to add to l², so it's (721 +200√6)/529 +50 -8√6.

Convert the 50 and -8√6 to denominators of 529:

50=50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= (-8√6)*529/529= (-4232√6)/529.

So, numerator becomes 721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6.

Which is 27171 -4032√6, as before.

So, yes, r²=(27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Hmm, this fraction is quite messy. Maybe we can factor numerator and denominator to see if they can be simplified.

First, check numerator: 27171 and 4032, see if they have a common factor.

Compute GCD of 27171 and 4032.

Compute 27171 ÷4032=6 times 4032=24192, remainder 27171-24192=2979.

Now GCD(4032,2979).

4032 ÷2979=1, remainder 4032-2979=1053.

GCD(2979,1053).

2979 ÷1053=2, remainder 2979-2106=873.

GCD(1053,873).

1053 ÷873=1, rem 180.

GCD(873,180).

873 ÷180=4, rem 873-720=153.

GCD(180,153).

180 ÷153=1, rem 27.

GCD(153,27)=9, since 153 ÷27=5 rem 18, then 27 ÷18=1 rem9, then 18 ÷9=2 rem0.

So, GCD is 9.

Therefore, numerator:27171 -4032√6. Let's factor 9:

27171 ÷9= 3019.

4032 ÷9=448.

So, numerator=9*(3019 - 448√6).

Denominator is 2116.

Check if 9 and 2116 have a common factor.

2116 is 46²= (2*23)^2=4*529. 529 is 23². So factors are 2² and 23².

9 is 3², which doesn't share any common factors with 2116 except 1.

So, r²= [9*(3019 -448√6)] /2116.

Which can be written as 9*(3019 -448√6)/2116.

But that seems as simplified as it can get.

Wait, but let me check 3019 and 448 for any common factors.

Compute GCD(3019,448).

448 is 64*7=2^6 *7.

3019 ÷7=431.285..., so not divisible by 7.

3019 ÷2: no, it's odd.

So, no common factors. So, numerator is 9*(3019 -448√6), denominator 2116.

So, r²= [9*(3019 -448√6)] /2116.

But wait, perhaps the numerator and denominator can be written differently.

Wait, 2116 is 46², which is 4*23².

Wait, 27171 -4032√6 is equal to 9*(3019 -448√6).

But perhaps instead of factoring 9, we can write it as:

r²= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Alternatively, perhaps we made a miscalculation earlier on.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to express l² + w² + h².

Wait, since lwh=23, and w=h, so l w²=23.

Wait, maybe we can use the relations between l and w.

Alternatively, perhaps express l as 23/w².

So, l=23/w².

Then, l² = (23)^2 /w^4=529/w^4.

w²=25-4√6.

So, l²=529/(25-4√6)^2.

Wait, but this might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of l² + 2w² as (l^2 + w^2 + h^2). Since h=w, yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I can find a better approach.

Wait, perhaps using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

But with two constraints, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the problem.

Given that w=h, we can express everything in terms of w.

So, as we did earlier, l=23/w².

So, l=23/w².

Then, the space diagonal squared is l² + 2w².

So, we have f(w)= (23/w²)^2 + 2w² = (529)/(w^4) + 2w².

We can take derivative with respect to w and find the minimum.

So, f(w)=529 w^{-4} + 2w².

Compute f’(w)= -4*529 w^{-5} +4w.

Set to zero:

-2116 w^{-5} +4w=0 ⇒ 4w=2116 w^{-5} ⇒ 4w^6=2116.

Simplify: w^6=2116/4=529.

So, w^6=529.

529 is 23², so w^6=23² ⇒ w^3=±23. But w>0, so w^3=23 ⇒ w=23^{1/3}.

Wait, hold on, that's different from earlier. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the derivative calculation.

f(w)=529 w^{-4} + 2w².

f’(w)= d/dw [529 w^{-4}] + d/dw [2w²] = -4*529 w^{-5} +4w.

So, f’(w)= (-2116)/w^5 +4w.

Set f’(w)=0:

-2116/w^5 +4w=0 ⇒ 4w=2116/w^5 ⇒ 4w^6=2116 ⇒ w^6=529 ⇒ w=(529)^{1/6}.

Wait, 529=23², so w=(23²)^{1/6}=23^{1/3}.

Ah, so w=23^{1/3}.

But earlier, when we solved the cubic, we got w=2 and w=-1 +2√6≈3.898. But 23^{1/3}≈2.843, which is between 2 and 3.898.

Hmm, so this suggests that perhaps my earlier approach via Lagrange multipliers might have missed something, or perhaps the minimal occurs at a boundary? Wait, but in optimization, sometimes multiple critical points can exist, so perhaps the minimal occurs at w=23^{1/3}, but wait, in our earlier analysis, we found that when w=2, which is less than 23^{1/3}, and another solution at w≈3.898, which is larger than 23^{1/3}.

Wait, let's compute 23^{1/3}. 2³=8, 3³=27, so 23^{1/3}≈2.843.

So, the critical point is at w≈2.843, which is between 2 and 3.898. So, perhaps this is a minima.

Wait, but earlier, when I used Lagrange multipliers, I found that w=2 is a solution, but when I used the derivative approach, I found a critical point at w=23^{1/3}.

This suggests that I may have made an error in the Lagrange multipliers approach.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when I subtracted the equations, I assumed l ≠ w and l ≠ h, but perhaps in reality, the minimal occurs when l ≠ w. Hmm, getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs at w=23^{1/3}.

Wait, let's compute f(w)=529 w^{-4} + 2w² at w=23^{1/3}.

Compute w³=23.

So, w=23^{1/3}, w²=23^{2/3}, w^{-4}=23^{-4/3}.

Thus, f(w)=529 *23^{-4/3} +2*23^{2/3}.

But 529=23², so:

f(w)=23² *23^{-4/3} + 2*23^{2/3}=23^{2 -4/3} + 2*23^{2/3}=23^{2/3} +2*23^{2/3}=3*23^{2/3}.

So, f(w)=3*23^{2/3}.

Therefore, r²= f(w)/4= (3*23^{2/3})/4.

Hmm, that's a much cleaner expression. So, perhaps this is the minimal value.

But wait, does this correspond to a critical point? Because earlier, when I solved via Lagrange multipliers, I found a critical point at w=2 and w=approx3.898, but perhaps the minimal is at w=23^{1/3}.

Wait, perhaps my earlier approach was flawed because I assumed h=w, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, no, earlier, when I subtracted the Lagrangian equations, I found that h=w, so that must be correct.

Wait, but in that case, why does the derivative approach via f(w) give a different result?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when I set h=w, I'm assuming symmetry, but perhaps the minimal occurs when the box isn't symmetric, i.e., when l, w, h are all different.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian approach, we found that h=w, which suggests that the minimal occurs when two sides are equal.

So, perhaps, the minimal occurs when h=w, but the minimal value for l² + w² + h² occurs at w=23^{1/3}.

But then, why in the Lagrangian approach, we didn't get this value.

Wait, perhaps the minimal occurs at w=23^{1/3} and that's the minimal value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Lagrangian approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct minimal occurs at w=23^{1/3}, and my earlier approach via Lagrange multipliers was incorrect because I may have made an error in the algebra.

Alternatively, perhaps both methods should agree, but they don't, which suggests an error.

Wait, maybe I should cross-verify by computing the value at w=23^{1/3}.

Compute r²=3*23^{2/3}/4.

Compute 23^{1/3}≈2.843, so 23^{2/3}≈8.095.

So, 3*8.095≈24.285, divided by4≈6.071.

But earlier, when w=2, we had r²≈131/64≈2.046 (Wait, no, wait 131/64 is 2.046, but wait no: 131/64 is 2.046875, but wait, that was when w=2, which gave r²=657/64≈10.2656.

Wait, no, hold on, earlier when w=2, l=5.75, and l² + 2w²≈41.0625, so r²≈41.0625/4≈10.2656.

But when w=23^{1/3}≈2.843, f(w)=3*(23^{2/3})=3*(~8.095)=~24.285, so r²=~6.071.

Which is lower than 10.2656. So, the minimal is lower, so perhaps the critical point at w=23^{1/3} is the minimal.

So, that suggests that my initial Lagrangian approach was flawed, perhaps because I made an error in the equations.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the subtraction step.

Wait, when I subtracted the Lagrangian equations, I assumed l ≠ w and so on, but perhaps the minimal occurs at l ≠ w, but h=w.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the Lagrangian approach.

Let me write the equations again.

We have:

1. 2l = λ(2(w + h)) + μ(wh)

2. 2w = λ(2(l + h)) + μ(lh)

3. 2h = λ(2(l + w)) + μ(lw)

From 1 and 2:

2l - 2w = λ(2(w + h - l - h)) + μ(wh - lh)

Simplify:

2(l - w) = λ(2(w - l)) + μ h(w - l)

Factor (l - w)=-(w - l):

-2(w - l) = -2λ(w - l) + μ h(w - l)

Divide both sides by (w - l), assuming w ≠ l:

-2 = -2λ + μ h

Similarly, from equation 1 and 3:

2l - 2h = λ(2(w + h - l - w)) + μ(wh - lw)

Simplify:

2(l - h) = λ(2(h - l)) + μ w (h - l)

Factor (l - h)=-(h - l):

-2(h - l) = -2λ (h - l) + μ w (h - l)

Divide both sides by (h - l), assuming h ≠ l:

-2 = -2λ + μ w

So now, from these results:

From 1 and 2: -2 = -2λ + μ h

From 1 and 3: -2 = -2λ + μ w

Set them equal:

-2λ + μ h = -2λ + μ w ⇒ μ h = μ w.

If μ ≠0, then h=w.

If μ=0, then from earlier, -2 = -2λ ⇒ λ=1, but then from equation 1:

2l = λ(2(w + h)) ⇒ 2l = 2(w + h) ⇒ l=w+h.

But with l=w+h, and w and h positive, but let's see if this can satisfy the constraints.

So, two cases:

Case A: μ=0.

Then, λ=1.

From equation 1: l = w + h.

From equation 2: 2w = 2(l + h) ⇒ w = l + h.

But from equation 1, l =w + h ⇒ substituting into equation 2: w = (w + h) + h ⇒ w =w +2h ⇒ 0=2h ⇒ h=0, which is impossible.

Thus, μ cannot be zero, so h=w.

Thus, h=w.

Therefore, we must have h=w.

Thus, back to the case where h=w.

So, in this case, let me try to re-examine the problem with h=w.

So, l, w, w.

Constraints:

2(lw + lw + w²)=54 ⇒4lw +2w²=54.

l w²=23.

So, l=23/w².

Substitute into first equation:

4*(23/w²)*w +2w²=54 ⇒92/w +2w²=54.

Multiply by w:92 +2w³=54w ⇒2w³ -54w +92=0 ⇒w³ -27w +46=0.

We found earlier that w=2 is a root.

Then, w³ -27w +46= (w -2)(w² +2w -23)=0.

Thus, other roots are w=(-2 ±√(4 +92))/2=(-2 ±√96)/2=(-2 ±4√6)/2=-1 ±2√6.

Only positive solution is w=-1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, as before, two possible w: 2 and ≈3.898.

Now, compute f(w)= l² +2w² for each case.

Case 1: w=2.

l=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

f(w)= (5.75)^2 +2*(2)^2=33.0625 +8=41.0625.

r²=41.0625/4=10.265625=657/64.

Case 2: w= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

Compute l=23/w².

w²= (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

Thus, l=23/(25 -4√6).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

l=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2]=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify: l=(25 +4√6)/23.

Compute f(w)=l² +2w².

l²=(25 +4√6)^2 /23²= (625 + 200√6 +96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

2w²=2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

Thus, f(w)= (721 +200√6)/529 +50 -8√6.

Express 50 as 26450/529 and -8√6 as (-4232√6)/529.

Thus, f(w)= [721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6]/529= [27171 -4032√6]/529.

Thus, r²= [27171 -4032√6]/(4*529)= [27171 -4032√6]/2116.

Hmm, this is the same result as before.

But earlier, when I considered f(w)=529 w^{-4} +2w² and took derivative, I found a critical point at w=23^{1/3}≈2.843, but in this case, the critical points are at w=2 and w≈3.898.

So, seems like the other approach is not applicable here because when we fixed h=w, the critical point is not at w=23^{1/3}.

But wait, perhaps I should compute f(w) at w=23^{1/3} and see if it's a minima.

Wait, but in our problem, when we fixed h=w, the critical points are only at w=2 and w≈3.898, so maybe the minimal occurs at w=3.898, as that gives a lower r² than w=2.

Wait, but wait, let me compute f(w) at w=23^{1/3}≈2.843.

But in this case, since we have fixed h=w, w must satisfy the cubic equation, which gives us solutions at w=2 and w≈3.898, but not at w≈2.843.

Thus, perhaps the minimal occurs at w≈3.898, giving r²≈8.168.

But earlier, when I treated l and w independently, I found a critical point at w≈2.843, but that's in a different scenario where I didn't fix h=w.

Hmm, perhaps that approach was incorrect because I should have considered h=w.

Thus, I think the correct minimal occurs when w= -1 +2√6, leading to r²=(27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this seems complicated, and the problem says that r² can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute it as follows:

Wait, when w= -1 +2√6, then w=2√6 -1.

So, let me compute l=23/(w²)=23/( (2√6 -1)^2 ).

Compute denominator: (2√6 -1)^2=24 -4√6 +1=25 -4√6.

Thus, l=23/(25 -4√6)=23*(25 +4√6)/ (25² - (4√6)^2 )=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, l=(25 +4√6)/23.

Now, compute l² + 2w².

Compute l²:

(25 +4√6)^2=625 + 200√6 + 96=721 +200√6.

Thus, l²=721 +200√6.

w²=25 -4√6.

Thus, 2w²=50 -8√6.

So, l² + 2w²=721 +200√6 +50 -8√6=771 +192√6.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because earlier, when I expressed it as fractions over 529, it was [27171 -4032√6]/529.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, l=(25 +4√6)/23, so l²=(721 +200√6)/529.

Similarly, 2w²=2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

Thus, total f(w)= (721 +200√6)/529 +50 -8√6.

Convert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6= (-8√6)*529/529= (-4232√6)/529.

So, f(w)= (721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6)/529= (721 +26450) + (200√6 -4232√6) all over 529.

721 +26450=27171.

200√6 -4232√6= -4032√6.

Thus, f(w)= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Then, r²= f(w)/4= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Now, to see if this fraction can be simplified.

Let me compute the numerator: 27171 -4032√6.

Denominator:2116.

But 2116=46²= (2*23)²=4*529.

Thus, denominator is 4*529.

So, perhaps the fraction can be written as (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529).

But let's check if numerator and denominator have any common factors.

We can factor numerator:

27171= let's see, 27171 ÷3=9057, which is 3*9057. 9057 ÷3=3019, which is a prime? Let me check.

Check if 3019 is prime.

Check divisibility up to sqrt(3019)≈55.

3019 ÷5=603.8→ not integer.

3019 ÷7=431.285→ no.

3019 ÷11=274.45→ no.

3019 ÷13=232.23→ no.

3019 ÷17=177.588→ no.

3019 ÷19=158.894→ no.

3019 ÷23=131.26→ no.

3019 ÷29=104.1→ no.

3019 ÷31=97.06→ no.

3019 ÷37=81.59→ no.

3019 ÷41=73.63→ no.

3019 ÷43=69.74→ no.

3019 ÷47=64.23→ no.

3019 ÷53=56.96→ no.

Thus, 3019 is prime.

Similarly, 4032= 4032= 2^6*3^2*7.

Thus, the numerator is 27171 -4032√6=3^2*3019 -2^6*3^2*7√6.

So, factors: 3^2 is common.

Thus, numerator=9*(3019 - 2^4*7√6)=9*(3019 - 112√6).

Denominator=4*23²=4*529.

Thus, the fraction is [9*(3019 -112√6)]/[4*529].

Since 3019 is prime and doesn't divide 4 or 529, and √6 is irrational, the numerator and denominator have no common factors beyond 1.

Thus, p=9*(3019 -112√6), but wait, no, p and q are integers, but √6 is irrational, which suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, no, because r² is a rational number, as it's written as p/q.

Wait, that suggests that my earlier calculation must be wrong because r² is supposed to be a rational number.

Wait, but in our problem, r² is expressed as (27171 -4032√6)/2116, which is irrational.

But the problem states that r² can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers.

Thus, my earlier approach must be incorrect because I must have made a mistake in assuming that h=w.

Wait, perhaps I should not have assumed h=w, but instead considered all variables l, w, h.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when the box is a cube, but that's not the case as we saw earlier.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the inequality between the space diagonal and surface area and volume.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the space diagonal in terms of surface area and volume.

Wait, I know that for a box, the space diagonal d=sqrt(l² +w² +h²).

We can express l² +w² +h² in terms of surface area and volume.

We have the identity:

(l + w + h)^2 = l² + w² + h² + 2(lw + lh + wh)

So, l² +w² +h²= (l +w +h)^2 - 2(lw + lh + wh)

We know that lw + lh + wh=27, from surface area: 2(lw + lh + wh)=54 ⇒ lw + lh + wh=27.

Thus, l² +w² +h²= (l +w +h)^2 - 54.

But we need to find l +w +h in terms of volume.

Alternatively, perhaps using the inequality that relates l +w +h to the volume and surface area.

But I don't recall an exact formula, but perhaps using AM ≥ GM.

Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers correctly.

Let me try again.

We have function to minimize: f(l,w,h)=l² +w² +h².

Constraints:

g(l,w,h)=2(lw + lh + wh)-54=0.

h(l,w,h)=lwh-23=0.

Set up Lagrangian:

L= l² +w² +h² -λ(2(lw + lh + wh)-54) -μ(lwh -23)

Compute partial derivatives:

∂L/∂l=2l - λ(2(w + h)) - μ(wh)=0.

Similarly,

∂L/∂w=2w - λ(2(l + h)) - μ(lh)=0.

∂L/∂h=2h - λ(2(l + w)) - μ(lw)=0.

So, equations are:

1. 2l = 2λ(w + h) + μ wh.

2. 2w = 2λ(l + h) + μ lh.

3. 2h = 2λ(l + w) + μ lw.

Let me write these as:

1. l = λ(w + h) + (μ/2) wh.

2. w = λ(l + h) + (μ/2) lh.

3. h = λ(l + w) + (μ/2) lw.

Now, perhaps subtract equations 1 and 2:

l - w = λ(w + h - l - h) + (μ/2)(wh - lh).

Simplify:

l - w = λ(w - l) + (μ/2) h(w - l).

Factor (l - w)=-(w - l):

l -w = -λ(l -w) + (μ/2) h (w - l).

Thus,

(l -w) = -(λ + (μ/2) h)(l -w).

If l ≠w, we can divide both sides by (l -w):

1 = -(λ + (μ/2) h).

Similarly, subtract equations 1 and 3:

l -h = λ(w + h - l - w) + (μ/2)(wh - lw).

Simplify:

l -h = λ(h - l) + (μ/2) w (h - l).

Factor (h - l)=-(l - h):

l -h = -λ(l - h) + (μ/2) w (h - l).

Thus,

l -h = (-λ - (μ/2)w)(l - h).

If l ≠h, divide both sides by (l -h):

1 = -λ - (μ/2) w.

Similarly, from equations 2 and 3:

w - h = λ(l + h - l -w) + (μ/2)(lh - lw).

Simplify:

w - h= λ(h -w) + (μ/2) l(h -w).

Factor (h -w)=-(w -h):

w -h= -λ(w - h) + (μ/2) l (h -w).

Thus,

w -h= (-λ - (μ/2) l)(w - h).

If w ≠h, divide by (w -h):

1= -λ - (μ/2) l.

So, from these results, we have:

From equations 1-2: 1= - (λ + (μ/2) h).

From equations 1-3:1= -λ - (μ/2) w.

From equations 2-3:1= -λ - (μ/2) l.

Thus, all three expressions equal to 1:

1= -λ - (μ/2) w.

1= -λ - (μ/2) l.

1= -λ - (μ/2) h.

Thus, from these, we have:

-λ - (μ/2) w = -λ - (μ/2) l ⇒ (μ/2) w = (μ/2) l.

If μ ≠0, then w=l.

Similarly, from other equations, we can see that w=l=h.

Thus, the minimal occurs when l=w=h, but that's a cube.

But earlier, we saw that a cube with surface area 54 would have volume 27, which is larger than 23.

Thus, this suggests that the minimal occurs at a cube, but our volume is less than that.

This is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, from the subtraction of equations, we have:

From equations 1-2: 1= - (λ + (μ/2) h).

From equations 1-3:1= -λ - (μ/2) w.

From equations 2-3:1= -λ - (μ/2) l.

So, this implies that:

λ + (μ/2) h= -1.

λ + (μ/2) w= -1.

λ + (μ/2) l= -1.

Thus, all equal to -1.

Thus, λ + (μ/2) h=λ + (μ/2) w=λ + (μ/2) l.

Which implies that h=w=l.

Thus, the minimal occurs when l=w=h, which is a cube.

But as before, a cube with surface area 54 has volume 27, which is larger than our given volume of 23.

Thus, perhaps the minimal occurs at a cube, but our problem's volume is less than that, which suggests that the minimal sphere that can contain all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23 must have a radius that can contain even the cube, which is larger.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B".

Thus, the sphere must contain all such boxes, including the cube with volume 27, which has a larger space diagonal.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the set B consists of boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. The cube with surface area 54 has volume 27, which is not in B. So, the minimal sphere must contain all boxes in B, which have volume 23. So, perhaps the cube is not in B, so the minimal sphere is determined by the boxes in B, not the cube.

Thus, the earlier approach where l=w=h isn't applicable because the cube isn't in our set B.

Thus, the minimal occurs when l≠w≠h.

But in our earlier approach via Lagrange multipliers, we found that h=w, leading to two possible solutions for w:2 and ≈3.898.

But when we computed the derivative treating h=w, we found that the minimal occurs at w= -1 +2√6≈3.898, giving a lower r²≈8.168.

So, perhaps this is the minimal.

Thus, the value of r² is (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But since the problem states that r² is a rational number, p/q, this suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the earlier assumption that h=w.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume h=w, but instead consider that when the sphere is minimal, the box is such that its space diagonal is minimal, given the surface area and volume constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps using the inequality between the space diagonal and the volume.

Wait, another approach: for a box, the space diagonal d satisfies d² = l² +w² +h².

We can use the AM ≥ GM inequality.

We know that l² +w² +h² ≥ (lwh)^{2/3} *3, by AM ≥ GM.

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming h=w.

But that led us to the conclusion that l=w=h, which isn't applicable here.

Thus, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, which we found as h=w.

Thus, I think the correct answer is r²=(27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But since this is an irrational number, but the problem states that r² is rational, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the minimal occurs at w=2, leading to r²=657/64.

But 657 and 64 are coprime? Let's check.

657 ÷3=219, 64 ÷3= no. 657 ÷2= no. So, 657=3*219=3*3*73. 64=2^6.

Thus, 657 and 64 are coprime? No, 657=3*3*73, 64=2^6. So, yes, they are coprime.

Thus, r²=657/64, so p=657, q=64, p+q=721.

But earlier, when w=2, r²≈10.2656, which is 657/64≈10.2656.

Alternatively, when w= -1 +2√6, r²≈8.168, which would be smaller, but in that case, r² is irrational, which contradicts the problem statement.

Thus, perhaps the correct minimal occurs at w=2, r²=657/64.

Thus, the answer is 657 +64=721.

But wait, earlier, when I used the derivative approach treating h=w, I found that the minimal occurs at w=23^{1/3}, but that led to r²=3*23^{2/3}/4, which is irrational.

But the problem states that r² is rational, so perhaps the correct minimal occurs at w=2, giving r²=657/64.

Thus, the answer is p+q=657+64=721.


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. The radius \( r \) is half the space diagonal of the box, so we need to minimize the space diagonal squared, \( l^2 + w^2 + h^2 \), given the constraints.

### Constraints:
1. Surface Area: \( 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 \)  
2. Volume: \( lwh = 23 \)

### Key Steps:
1. **Assume Symmetry**: We assume \( h = w \) to simplify the problem, leading to the constraints:
   - \( 4lw + 2w^2 = 54 \)
   - \( lw^2 = 23 \)

2. **Solve for \( l \)**: From the volume constraint, \( l = \frac{23}{w^2} \). Substituting into the surface area constraint gives a cubic equation in \( w \):
   \[
   w^3 - 27w + 46 = 0
   \]
   The roots are \( w = 2 \) and \( w = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \approx 3.898 \).

3. **Evaluate \( r^2 \)**:
   - For \( w = 2 \), \( l = 5.75 \). The space diagonal squared is:
     \[
     l^2 + 2w^2 = 5.75^2 + 2(2^2) = 33.0625 + 8 = 41.0625
     \]
     Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{41.0625}{4} = \frac{657}{64} \).

   - For \( w = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \), the space diagonal squared is irrational, which contradicts the problem's requirement that \( r^2 \) is rational.

4. **Conclusion**: The valid solution is when \( w = 2 \), leading to \( r^2 = \frac{657}{64} \). Therefore, \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \), giving \( p + q = 721 \).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{721}
