Okay, I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again.

We need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, so two equations with three variables. It's a system of equations, but with the variables being nonnegative integers. That sounds tricky, but maybe there's a way to simplify it.

First, let me write down the given equations.

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, looking at equation 2, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor or rearrange it somehow.

Wait, equation 2 can be factored by grouping. Let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So equation 2 becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

But from equation 1, we know that a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into equation 2:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

So that simplifies equation 2 to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Which can be written as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. So now I have this equation involving a², b², c², and their cubes. Hmm.

Wait, I also know that a + b + c = 300, so maybe I can find expressions involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other variables.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So, since a + b + c = 300, then (300)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

Which gives:

90,000 = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So, let me denote S = a² + b² + c² and T = ab + bc + ca.

Then, S + 2T = 90,000.

Also, from equation 2 in the problem, I had:

300S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, and I also know that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of S and T.

I recall the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Which is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*T + 3abc

Let me compute 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900T + 3abc

Now, substituting this back into equation 2's transformed version:

300S - [27,000,000 - 900T + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Let's simplify this:

300S -27,000,000 + 900T - 3abc = 6,000,000

Bring the -27,000,000 to the right:

300S + 900T - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000

Which is:

300S + 900T - 3abc = 33,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100S + 300T - abc = 11,000,000

So now, I have:

100S + 300T - abc = 11,000,000

But from earlier, I know that S + 2T = 90,000.

So we have two equations:

1. S + 2T = 90,000
2. 100S + 300T - abc = 11,000,000

Let me try to express S in terms of T from the first equation.

From equation 1: S = 90,000 - 2T

Substitute S into equation 2:

100*(90,000 - 2T) + 300T - abc = 11,000,000

Compute 100*90,000 = 9,000,000 and 100*(-2T) = -200T.

So:

9,000,000 - 200T + 300T - abc = 11,000,000

Combine like terms:

9,000,000 + 100T - abc = 11,000,000

Bring 9,000,000 to the other side:

100T - abc = 2,000,000

So:

100T - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm, so we have this equation involving T and abc.

But I also know that T = ab + bc + ca.

So, T is the sum of the products of the variables two at a time.

I wonder if there's a way to relate T and abc. Maybe if I assume some symmetry or specific values.

Wait, perhaps we can assume that two variables are equal or something like that. Since the equations are symmetric in a, b, c, maybe the solutions have some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe we can let one of the variables be zero. Let me think.

If one of the variables is zero, say c=0. Then, a + b = 300, and the equation becomes T = ab, and abc = 0.

So, substituting c=0 into equation 2: Let's see, equation 2 is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. If c=0, it's a²b + b²a = 6,000,000.

Which is ab(a + b) = 6,000,000. Since a + b = 300, that becomes ab*300 = 6,000,000.

So ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.

So ab = 20,000, and a + b = 300. So now, we can solve for a and b.

a and b are nonnegative integers such that a + b = 300 and ab=20,000.

So, the quadratic equation would be x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Solving for x:

x = [300 ± sqrt(300² - 4*1*20,000)] / 2

Compute discriminant:

300² = 90,000

4*1*20,000 = 80,000

So sqrt(90,000 - 80,000) = sqrt(10,000) = 100

Thus, x = [300 ± 100]/2

So x = (300 + 100)/2 = 400/2 = 200

Or x = (300 - 100)/2 = 200/2 = 100

So, a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200.

So, when c=0, we have two solutions: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But since the problem asks for triples, and the variables are ordered, we need to consider all permutations.

Wait, but in this case, c=0, so the possible triples would be (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and also considering that c can be any of the variables. So, actually, if c=0, then the triples are permutations of (200,100,0). How many such permutations are there?

Since two of the variables are equal in a way (not really,
