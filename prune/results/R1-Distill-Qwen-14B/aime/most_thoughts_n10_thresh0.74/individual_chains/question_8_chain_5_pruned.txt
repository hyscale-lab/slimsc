Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's quite a mouthful. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I know that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of the three numbers is 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated. It involves terms like a squared times b, a squared times c, etc. Let me see if I can simplify or factor that expression somehow.

Looking at the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, I notice that each term is a product of two different variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let me try to rearrange the terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That seems a bit better, but maybe I can factor it further. Let me think about whether there's a common factor or a way to write this in terms of symmetric functions.

Wait, another approach: maybe express this in terms of a + b + c and ab + bc + ca. Let me recall some algebraic identities. I know that (a + b + c)^3 expands to a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc. Hmm, that's similar but not exactly what I have. Let me see:

If I take (a + b + c)^3, it includes the terms a²b, a²c, etc., each multiplied by 3, and also includes the 6abc term. My expression is the sum of a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, which is exactly one-third of the expansion minus the a^3, b^3, c^3 terms and the 6abc term. Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the given expression as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Let me check that:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)
= a²b + a b c + a²c + a b² + b²c + a b c + a c² + b c² + c²a
Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me compute it properly:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)
= a²b + abc + a²c + ab² + b²c + abc + abc + b c² + c²a
= a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 3abc

So the expansion is a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 3abc. Which is exactly our expression plus 3abc. So that means:

a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

So, from the problem statement, the second equation is equal to 6,000,000. So we can write:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

We know that a + b + c = 300, so substituting that in:

300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me write that equation again:

300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor 3 out of the left side:

3*(100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So now we have:

100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me denote x = ab + bc + ca and y = abc. So the equation becomes:

100x - y = 2,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as:

y = 100x - 2,000,000.

So, y is 100 times x minus 2,000,000. But since y = abc is a product of nonnegative integers, it must be nonnegative. So, 100x - 2,000,000 ≥ 0. Which implies x ≥ 20,000.

So, x must be at least 20,000. Let me also note that x is ab + bc + ca, which is symmetric in a, b, c.

Now, let's think about the problem in terms of symmetric polynomials. We have a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ca = x, and abc = y = 100x - 2,000,000.

So, the variables a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation:

t^3 - (a + b + c) t^2 + (ab + bc + ca) t - abc = 0.

Which becomes:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + x t - (100x - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify this equation:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + x t - 100x + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's a cubic equation in t, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can find relationships between x and other variables.

Another approach: Let's consider variables a, b, c as nonnegative integers adding up to
