Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\], where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers, especially when there's a modulus condition like |z| = 4, it's often useful to express z in polar form. So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That should make things easier since dealing with exponents might simplify the expression.

Wait, but z is a complex number, so another way to write it is z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). That might come in handy later, but let me see.

So, the expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me plug in z = 4e^{iθ} into this expression.

First, compute (75 + 117i)z. That would be (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}.

Similarly, compute (96 + 144i)/z. Since z = 4e^{iθ}, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

So putting it all together, the expression becomes 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to compute the real part of this entire expression. Let me denote A = 4*(75 + 117i) and B = (24 + 36i). So the expression is A*e^{iθ} + B*e^{-iθ}.

The real part of this would be Re(A*e^{iθ} + B*e^{-iθ}) = Re(A*e^{iθ}) + Re(B*e^{-iθ}).

I know that Re(C*e^{iθ}) for a complex number C is equal to Re(C) cosθ - Im(C) sinθ. Wait, actually, more precisely, if C = c1 + c2i, then Re(C e^{iθ}) = c1 cosθ - c2 sinθ. Let me verify that.

Yes, because C e^{iθ} = (c1 + c2i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = c1 cosθ - c2 sinθ + i(c1 sinθ + c2 cosθ). So the real part is indeed c1 cosθ - c2 sinθ.

So, applying that to both A e^{iθ} and B e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute A first: A = 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i. So, c1 for A is 300, c2 is 468.

Similarly, B = 24 + 36i, so c1 is 24, c2 is 36.

Now, Re(A e^{iθ}) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Re(B e^{-iθ}) would be Re[(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)]. Wait, expanding this, it's 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ. Because:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ + 24 (-i sinθ) + 36i cosθ + 36i (-i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - i 24 sinθ + i 36 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

So, Re(B e^{-iθ}) is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So, putting it all together, the real part of the original expression is:

300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Our goal is to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

Hmm. So, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. This is a linear combination of sine and cosine, which I know can be rewritten in the form R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude.

The maximum value of this expression will be R, since the maximum of R cos(θ + φ) is R.

So, let's compute R. For an expression a cosθ + b sinθ, the amplitude R is sqrt(a² + b²).

Wait, but in our case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, so a = 324, b = -432.

So, R = sqrt(324² + (-432)²) = sqrt(324² + 432²).

Let me compute 324² and 432².

324²: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300² = 90000, 24²=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 +24²=90000+14400+576= 105, 976? Wait let me compute 324 * 324.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor it.

324 = 18² * 1, since 18² is 324. Wait, no, 18*18=324, so 324 is 18². So 324² = (18²)² = 18^4 = (18²)^2 = 324², which is 104,976. Let me confirm: 300²=90,000, 24²=576, 2*300*24=14,400. So 90,000+14,400=104,400 +576= 104,976. Yes.

432²: Let's see, 400²=160,000, 32²=1,024, and the cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So (400+32)^2= 400² + 2*400*32 +32² = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Hmm, what's sqrt(291,600)? Let me see, 540² is 291,600 because 500²=250,000, 540²= (500+40)^2=500² + 2*500*40 +40²= 250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So R=540.

So, the maximum real part is 540. So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me check my computation of R again.

Expression: 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So, a=324, b=-432.

Thus, R = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600)=540.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, I could have written the expression as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ = R cos(θ + φ), where tanφ = (b)/a, but since b is negative, it would adjust the angle accordingly.

But regardless, the maximum value is R.

So, I think the answer is 540.


The largest possible real part is found by expressing \( z \) in polar form and simplifying the given expression. The real part simplifies to \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \), whose maximum value is the amplitude \( \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540 \).

\boxed{540}
