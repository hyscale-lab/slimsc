Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So, moving from the lower left (which I'll consider as (0,0)) to the upper right (8,8)). Each step on the grid is either to the right or upwards.

Wait, but the problem says the paths have length 16. That makes sense because to go from (0,0) to (8,8), you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves, 8 each.

Now, the problem is about the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Changing direction means switching from moving right to up or from up to right. So, for example, a path might go right, right, up, right, up, etc., and each time it switches, that's a direction change.

Let me think about how direction changes work. If a path changes direction exactly four times, that means the path consists of five segments. Because each direction change marks the end of one segment and the start of another. So, with four direction changes, there are five segments.

Each segment alternates between right and up. So, the first segment could be right, then up, then right, and so on, or it could start with up, then right, etc. But in our case, since we're going from (0,0) to (8,8), which requires both right and up moves, the path must start with either right or up, and alternate.

Wait, but starting with right or up will affect the number of segments. Let me clarify: If the path starts with a right move, the segments will be right, up, right, up, etc. Similarly, starting with up would be up, right, up, right, etc. Either way, the number of direction changes is four, leading to five segments.

Now, each segment is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. For example, the first segment might be right for some steps, then up for some steps, then right again, etc.

Since the total number of right moves is 8 and the total number of up moves is 8, each segment must contribute to these totals. Let's say the path starts with a right segment. Then the number of right segments will be three, and the number of up segments will be two, or vice versa? Wait, no. Let's see.

If the path changes direction four times, and it starts with a right, then the sequence is right, up, right, up, right. So that's three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, if it starts with up, it'll be up, right, up, right, up. So that's three up segments and two right segments. So, depending on whether the first segment is right or up, the number of segments of each direction will differ.

But in our case, the total number of right and up moves are both 8. So, if the path starts with right, the right segments will have lengths r1, r2, r3, each contributing to the total of 8. Similarly, the up segments will have lengths u1, u2, each contributing to 8. Alternatively, if it starts with up, the up segments will have lengths u1, u2, u3, and the right segments will have r1, r2.

Wait, so starting with right would result in three right segments and two up segments, each of which must be at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero length; that would mean no change in direction. So, each segment must have at least one step.

So, if the path starts with right, then the three right segments and two up segments each have at least one step. Similarly, starting with up would mean three up segments and two right segments, each at least one step.

So, let me model this. Let's consider both cases: starting with right and starting with up.

Case 1: Path starts with right.

Then, the segments are: right (r1), up (u1), right (r2), up (u2), right (r3).

Each r1, u1, r2, u2, r3 ≥ 1.

Sum of rights: r1 + r2 + r3 = 8.

Sum of ups: u1 + u2 = 8.

Similarly, Case 2: Path starts with up.

Segments: up (u1), right (r1), up (u2), right (r2), up (u3).

Each u1, r1, u2, r2, u3 ≥ 1.

Sum of ups: u1 + u2 + u3 = 8.

Sum of rights: r1 + r2 = 8.

Okay, so for each case, we can compute the number of possible paths.

But wait, do we have to consider both cases (starting with right or up) separately and then add them together?

Because the total number of paths could start with either direction, so both cases are possible.

So, the total number will be the sum of the number of paths starting with right and the number starting with up.

Now, let's compute for each case.

Starting with right:

Number of ways to divide 8 rights into 3 segments: this is equivalent to the number of integer solutions to r1 + r2 + r3 =8, where each r_i ≥1.

Similarly, number of ways to divide 8 ups into 2 segments: u1 + u2 =8, u_i ≥1.

The number of solutions for the rights is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) =21.

Similarly, for the ups: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1)=7.

So, for starting with right, number of ways is 21 *7=147.

Similarly, for starting with up:

Number of ways to divide 8 ups into 3 segments: C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to divide 8 rights into 2 segments: C(7,1)=7.

So, starting with up gives 21*7=147.

Therefore, total number of paths is 147 +147 =294.

Wait, but hold on. Is that all?

Wait, no. Because in each case, the way the segments are arranged also depends on the number of direction changes. But I think I considered that by breaking into starting with right or up.

But wait, another thought: could the starting direction affect the number of possible direction changes?

Wait, no. Because regardless of starting direction, the number of direction changes is four, leading to five segments. So, starting with right gives 3 right segments and 2 up segments, and starting with up gives 3 up segments and 2 right segments.

Wait, but in both cases, the number of ways to split the steps is similar, so 21*7 in each case, adding up to 294.

But wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, for starting with right, we have 3 right segments and 2 up segments.

Each right segment is at least 1, so the number of ways is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, each up segment is at least 1, so C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

Multiplying these gives 21*7=147.

Same for starting with up: 21*7=147.

So, total is 147*2=294.

But wait, let me think again about the direction changes.

A direction change occurs each time the movement switches from right to up or up to right.

So, in a path that starts with right, the sequence is right, up, right, up, right. So, four direction changes: right to up, up to right, right to up, up to right.

Similarly, starting with up: up, right, up, right, up. Four direction changes.

So, both cases have four direction changes, so both should be considered.

Thus, adding them is correct.

Wait, but is there any other case? Like, perhaps, some paths that have more direction changes but somehow end up with four? No, because each direction change is counted as a switch, and the path must have exactly four.

So, I think 294 is the answer.

But let me just think of an alternative approach to confirm.

Another way to model this is to consider the number of runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. The number of runs is equal to the number of direction changes plus one.

In this problem, the number of direction changes is four, so the number of runs is five.

Each run alternates between right and up.

So, the number of runs is five, which can start with right or up.

Thus, the number of paths is equal to the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts (for the starting direction with more runs) plus the number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts (for the other direction).

Wait, no. Let's see:

If the number of runs is five, and it starts with right, then the number of right runs is three and up runs is two.

Similarly, if it starts with up, the number of up runs is three and right runs is two.

So, the number of compositions for 8 into three parts for right and two parts for up, multiplied by the number of ways to interleave the runs.

Wait, no, in the runs approach, once the lengths of each run are determined, the sequence is determined because runs alternate between right and up.

So, for starting with right, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. The lengths of these runs are r1, u1, r2, u2, r3, each ≥1.

So, the number of ways is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts (for right) multiplied by the number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts (for up).

Which is C(7,2) * C(7,1) =21*7=147.

Similarly, for starting with up: U, R, U, R, U. The number of compositions for up is C(7,2) and for right is C(7,1), so again 21*7=147.

Adding these gives 294. So, same as earlier.

But wait, let me think in terms of combinations. The total number of paths without any restriction is C(16,8), which is 12870.

But the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 294. Is that plausible?

Wait, 294 is much smaller than 12870, which makes sense because adding constraints reduces the number.

Alternatively, another way to compute it is to model the number of ways to choose the four points where the direction changes occur.

But in this model, each direction change corresponds to a switch from right to up or up to right.

Wait, but in the grid, a direction change occurs when you move from a right step to an up step or vice versa. So, each direction change is a switch, which happens between two consecutive steps.

So, the number of direction changes is four, meaning that between steps, four times the direction switches.

So, it's similar to partitioning the 16 steps into five runs, alternating between R and U.

But, since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), the number of R and U runs must differ by at most one.

Wait, no, because starting with R and ending with R would have three R runs and two U runs, as we had earlier.

Similarly, starting with U and ending with U would have three U runs and two R runs.

Alternatively, if the path starts and ends with different directions, the number of runs would be equal. But in our case, since the number of R and U steps are equal (both 8), the number of runs must be equal if starting and ending with different directions. Wait, but in our problem, since the number of direction changes is four, which implies five runs.

Wait, wait, maybe I can model this with the formula for the number of monotonic paths with a specified number of runs.

I remember that the number of paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with exactly k runs is given by some formula. Let me recall.

The number of such paths is 2 * C(m-1, t-1) * C(n-1, t-1), where t is the number of runs divided by 2 or something? Hmm, maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, in our case, the number of runs is five. So, the number of runs can be either starting with R or starting with U. Let me refer to the formula.

Wait, alternatively, I came across a formula that the number of paths with exactly r runs is 2 * C(m-1, r/2 -1) * C(n-1, r/2 -1) when r is even, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it with compositions.

Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. So, for starting with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.

Each R run must have at least one R, and each U run must have at least one U.

So, the number of ways to distribute the R's is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts. Similarly for U's into 2 parts.

As done earlier, which is C(7,2) for R and C(7,1) for U, giving 21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with U, it's 21*7=147.

Total is 294.

So, 294 is the answer.

Wait, but let me think with a smaller grid to see if this makes sense.

Suppose we have a 2x2 grid, and we want paths from (0,0) to (2,2) with exactly two direction changes.

So, the path length is 4 steps: 2 R and 2 U.

Number of direction changes is two.

So, the number of runs would be three.

Which can start with R or U.

Case 1: Starting with R. So, runs are R, U, R.

The number of ways to split 2 R's into 2 runs: each run must have at least one R. So, compositions of 2 into 2 parts: (1,1). So, only 1 way.

Similarly, splitting 2 U's into 1 part: (2). Only 1 way.

So, starting with R: 1*1=1.

Case 2: Starting with U. Similarly, runs are U, R, U.

Splitting 2 U's into 2 parts: only (1,1), 1 way.

Splitting 2 R's into 1 part: (2), 1 way.

So, starting with U: 1*1=1.

Total paths: 1+1=2.

But let's count manually.

Possible paths with exactly two direction changes in a 2x2 grid.

Each path must have two direction changes, meaning it has three runs: R, U, R or U, R, U.

So, for R, U, R:

The path could be RRUU, but that's two runs, not three. Wait, no.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the path has four steps. To have exactly two direction changes, the path must switch direction twice.

So, for example:

R, R, U, U: that's one direction change (after two R's). Not two.

R, U, R, U: that's three direction changes. Wait, no.

Wait, actually, in four steps, if you have two direction changes, the number of runs is three.

Wait, let's think:

Start with R, switch to U, then switch back to R. So, R, U, R. But in four steps, with two R's and two U's.

Wait, it's not possible to have three runs in four steps with two R's and two U's, because each run has at least one step.

Wait, for three runs, you need at least three steps: one for each run. But we have four steps.

So, for three runs, the distribution could be 1,1,2 or 1,2,1 or 2,1,1.

So, for starting with R:

Possible distributions:

R:1, U:1, R:2.

Or R:2, U:1, R:1.

Similarly starting with U.

So, for R, U, R:

Number of ways: C(1,1) * C(1,1) * C(2,2) = but that's not the right approach.

Wait, in terms of compositions:

For starting with R, the R runs are two runs, each at least 1, summing to 2.

So, compositions of 2 into 2 parts: (1,1).

Similarly, U runs are one part: (2).

So, number of ways: 1 (for R) *1 (for U) =1.

Similarly, starting with U: 1 *1=1.

So, total paths: 2.

But wait, let me list them.

Starting with R:

The path would be R, U, R, U.

But that has three direction changes: R to U, U to R, R to U.

Wait, no. Wait, in four steps, starting with R, the path would be R, U, R, U. But that's four steps, with direction changes after first, second, and third steps. So, three direction changes.

Wait, but in the problem, we want exactly two direction changes.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify: the number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches. So, for a path like R, R, U, U: direction changes once (from R to U).

For a path like R, U, R, U: direction changes three times (R to U, U to R, R to U).

Hmm, so in a 2x2 grid, how can we have exactly two direction changes?

Wait, perhaps it's not possible. Because with four steps, and to have two direction changes, you would need to switch direction twice, which would lead to three runs.

But to have three runs with two direction changes would require the path to switch direction twice, leading to three runs.

Wait, let's think of a concrete example.

Start with R, then switch to U, then switch back to R.

So, the path would be R, U, R, U.

Wait, but that's four steps, with direction changes after first, second, and third steps, so three direction changes.

Wait, maybe in a 2x2 grid, it's not possible to have exactly two direction changes. So, the number of such paths is zero.

Wait, that contradicts our earlier calculation which gave two paths. So, something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Because in the small case, our method gave 2, but actually, it's impossible.

Wait, so perhaps the formula isn't applicable for even numbers or something.

Alternatively, maybe in the 2x2 grid, the only way to have two direction changes is to have three runs, but in four steps, that's not possible because each run must be at least one step.

So, for three runs, you need at least three steps, but with four steps, the last run would have one step, but the first two runs would have one each.

Wait, in that case, for starting with R: R, U, R, U. That's four steps, three direction changes. So, that's three direction changes, not two.

Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U, R. Again, three direction changes.

So, in the 2x2 grid, there are no paths with exactly two direction changes. So, our formula gave 2, which is wrong.

So, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait, what's the problem here?

Ah, maybe the formula is only applicable when the number of runs is even or something. Or perhaps the formula doesn't account for some constraints.

Wait, let me think again.

In the 2x2 grid, to have exactly two direction changes, the path must switch direction twice, which would mean three runs.

But with four steps, it's impossible to have three runs because each run requires at least one step, so three runs would require at least three steps. But with four steps, the fourth step is an extra, but it would have to be part of the third run, but then you can't have a fourth step without another direction change.

Wait, no, the run is a consecutive sequence. So, for three runs, each run is at least one step, but it's possible.

Wait, for example, in four steps, a path could be R, U, R, R. That's three runs: R, U, R, R. So, direction changes after first and second steps: two direction changes.

Wait, yes! So, R, U, R, R is a path with two direction changes.

Similarly, R, U, U, R would also have two direction changes.

Wait, so let's count all such paths in 2x2 grid with exactly two direction changes.

So, the number of runs is three, which is odd, so it must start with either R or U.

Let me count.

Case 1: Starting with R.

Runs: R, U, R.

So, R's: first run and third run.

U's: second run.

Number of R's: 2, split into two runs: each run must have at least 1.

So, possible splits: (1,1).

Similarly, U's:1 run, 1 step.

So, the path would be R, U, R, R.

Is that the only one?

Wait, no, because the U run can have more than one step? Wait, no, because U's are only 1 run, which must be 1 step.

Wait, no, wait: the total U's are 2, but the U run is only one run. So, the U run must have two steps.

Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, no, the total number of U's is 2, but if we have two runs starting with R, R runs are three? No, starting with R, it's three runs: R, U, R.

So, R runs: first and third, U run: second.

So, R1 + R2 =2, each R_i ≥1.

U1=2.

So, R1 and R2 can be (1,1).

So, the path is R, R, U, U. But that only has one direction change.

Wait, no, no. Wait, if the U run is only one run, but of length 2.

Wait, the path would be R, U, U, R. So, starting with R, then switch to U for two steps, then switch back to R.

So, direction changes after first step (R to U) and after third step (U to R). So, two direction changes.

Similarly, another path starting with R: R, U, R, U.

But that has three direction changes, not two.

Wait, so perhaps only certain compositions are allowed.

Wait, in this case, for starting with R, the U run must have two steps, so the path is R, U, U, R. So, two direction changes.

Similarly, starting with U, the R run must have two steps: U, R, R, U. Two direction changes.

Are there any other paths?

What about R, U, R, U? That has three direction changes, so it's excluded.

And U, R, U, R: same.

So, in total, only two paths in 2x2 grid with exactly two direction changes.

Which matches our initial formula.

So, the formula seems correct in this case.

Earlier confusion was because I thought the path R, U, R, R would have two direction changes, but actually, that path is R, U, R, R.

Wait, that's R, U, R, R: direction changes after first (R to U) and after second (U to R). So, two direction changes.

Wait, but in this path, the third step is R, so it's part of the third run, and the fourth step is R, part of the same run.

So, total runs: R, U, R.

So, three runs, two direction changes.

Wait, so in this case, the formula gives two paths, which is correct.

So, my initial formula works.

So, in the 8x8 grid, with four direction changes, which gives five runs, the formula gives 294, which should be correct.

Another way to think about it: each direction change corresponds to a switch between R and U.

So, the number of direction changes is four, which implies five runs.

Each run is a consecutive sequence of R or U steps.

So, the number of such paths is the number of ways to partition the R steps into either 3 or 2 runs, and the U steps into 2 or 3 runs, respectively, depending on starting direction.

As we calculated, 147 +147=294.

Hence, the answer is 294.


To solve the problem of counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths.

Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 steps. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. With exactly four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments (runs) of consecutive R or U moves.

### Case 1: Path starts with a right (R) move
- The sequence of segments is: R, U, R, U, R.
- Total R segments: 3, each contributing to the total of 8 R moves.
- Total U segments: 2, each contributing to the total of 8 U moves.
- The number of ways to distribute 8 R moves into 3 segments (each ≥1) is given by the combinatorial formula \( C(7, 2) = 21 \).
- The number of ways to distribute 8 U moves into 2 segments (each ≥1) is \( C(7, 1) = 7 \).
- Total paths starting with R: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

### Case 2: Path starts with an up (U) move
- The sequence of segments is: U, R, U, R, U.
- Total U segments: 3, each contributing to the total of 8 U moves.
- Total R segments: 2, each contributing to the total of 8 R moves.
- The number of ways to distribute 8 U moves into 3 segments (each ≥1) is \( C(7, 2) = 21 \).
- The number of ways to distribute 8 R moves into 2 segments (each ≥1) is \( C(7, 1) = 7 \).
- Total paths starting with U: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

### Total Number of Paths
Adding the results from both cases, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:
\[ 147 + 147 = 294 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\boxed{294}
