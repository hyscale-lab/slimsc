Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Let me try to visualize what's going on here.

First, the problem says that D, E, C, F are collinear. That means these four points lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, so A, D, H, G are concyclic or lie on the same circle, which might mean that certain angles are equal because of the cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch of what this might look like. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is 107, which would make CD also 107. BC is 16, so AD is 16 as well.

Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF is 184, which makes GH 184, and FG is 17, so EH is also 17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they lie on a straight line. Let me consider the line as a number line for easier calculations. Let's assign coordinates to some points to model this.

Maybe I can place point D at the origin (0,0) to simplify things. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16, the coordinates of the other points can be determined.

Wait, but if D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, C would be at (107, 16), because moving from D, which is a corner, to C would be along the length AB and the height BC. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, the sides are adjacent, so the coordinates might be a bit different.

Wait, no, if we consider the rectangle ABCD with D at (0,0), then since AB is 107, which is the length, and BC is 16, which is the width. So, if we move from D to A, it's along the y-axis (since BC is vertical), so A would be at (0,16). Then, moving from A to B, it's along the x-axis by 107 units, so B would be at (107,16). Then, C would be at (107,0). So, the rectangle is placed with D at (0,0), C at (107,0), B at (107,16), and A at (0,16).

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line passes through D (0,0), E, C (107,0), and F. Wait, but in the rectangle EFGH, EF is 184, and FG is 17. So, EFGH is another rectangle.

Wait, if I'm considering E, F, G, H as a rectangle, then EF is one side, FG is another. So, EF is 184, FG is 17. So, EF is horizontal, FG is vertical.

But wait, since E, F are on the line through D, E, C, F, which is the x-axis from D (0,0) to C (107,0). So, the line is the x-axis. Therefore, F is on the x-axis, as well as E.

Wait, but E is between D and C, or is E beyond C? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so I might have to figure that out.

So, E is somewhere along the x-axis, possibly between D and C or beyond C. Similarly, F is on the same line.

Let me try to assign coordinates based on this.

Since D is at (0,0), and C is at (107,0). Let me assume that E is between D and C, so E would be at some point (e, 0) where 0 < e < 107. Then, F would be another point on the x-axis beyond C or before D.

Wait, but if E is between D and C, then F would need to be somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe E is beyond C on the x-axis. Let's think.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is 184, FG is 17. So, starting at E, moving to F is 184 units along the x-axis, then from F moving up 17 units to G, then back to H, and so on.

Wait, but since E and F are on the x-axis, perhaps EF is a horizontal side of the rectangle EFGH. So, if EF is
