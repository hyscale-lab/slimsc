Alright, so I have this problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me jot down what I know. First, the circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. The triangle has a circumcenter O and incenter I. IA is perpendicular to OI. Interesting condition. I've heard that in some triangles, the incenter lies on the circumcircle, but this seems different because IA is perpendicular to OI.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me confirm that. Yeah, I think that's correct. So let's calculate OI first.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, plugging into the formula: OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Wait, but in our problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. That must mean that triangle IAO is a right triangle with legs IA and OI, and hypotenuse AO.

Wait, AO is the circumradius, right? Because O is the circumcenter, so AO = R = 13. So in triangle IAO, IA is perpendicular to OI, making it a right triangle. So by the Pythagorean theorem, IA² + OI² = AO².

Wait, but I can also write IA² + (sqrt(13))² = 13². So IA² + 13 = 169. Therefore, IA² = 169 -13 = 156. So IA is sqrt(156). Hmm, simplifying sqrt(156) would be sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2√39.

But wait, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I think that the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in
