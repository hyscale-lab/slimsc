Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of sets Bob lists is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, Bob is considering all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in A. So, for each element 'a' in A, how many such sets B can we have where 'a' is the maximum element?

Let me think about it. If 'a' is the maximum element of B, then all the other elements of B must be less than 'a'. Also, B has to be a nonempty set, so for each 'a', the number of possible sets B where 'a' is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} that are nonempty, right? Because each element in B must be less than 'a', and B can't be empty.

Wait, no. Because the set B can have any number of elements, as long as the maximum is 'a'. So, the number of such sets is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set, and then adding 'a' to each subset to make B. But since B must be non-empty, the empty subset would correspond to the set {a}, which is allowed because B is non-empty. So, the number of such B for a given 'a' is 2^{a-1}. Because each of the elements 1 to a-1 can be either included or excluded, giving 2^{a-1} subsets. And since each subset corresponds to a unique B by adding 'a', that's the count.

So, the total number of sets in Bob's list is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. Because for each a in A, there are 2^{a-1} sets where 'a' is the maximum element.

Given that Bob's list has 2024 sets, we have:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Now, we need to find A such that this sum equals 2024, and then compute the sum of the elements in A.

So, the problem reduces to finding A where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024. Then, sum the elements of A.

Let me think about how to represent 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. Since 2^{a-1} is the same as (1/2)*2^a, but more importantly, each term is a power of 2. So, 2^{a-1} is 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., for a=1,2,3,4,...

So, 2024 can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Let me try to express 2024 in binary to see which powers of 2 are present.

Wait, 2^{10} is 1024, 2^{11} is 2048. So, 2024 is between 2^{10} and 2^{11}.

Let me compute 2024 in binary.

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2=506, rem 0.

506/2=253, rem 0.

253/2=126 rem1.

126/2=63 rem0.

63/2=31 rem1.

31/2=15 rem1.

15/2=7 rem1.

7/2=3 rem1.

3/2=1 rem1.

1/2=0 rem1.

So, writing the remainders from last to first: 11111101000.

Wait, let me count the number of bits. Let's see:

The remainders in reverse order:

1 (from last division) then 1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0.

Wait, that's 11 bits. Let me check:

1*(2^10) + 1*(2^9) + 1*(2^8) + 1*(2^7) + 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 0*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 0*(2^1) + 0*(2^0)

So, 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 +0+0= Let's compute this:

1024 +512=1536

1536+256=1792

1792+128=1920

1920+64=1984

1984+32=2016

2016+8=2024.

Yes, correct. So, 2024 is 11111101000 in binary, which is 11 bits. So, in terms of powers of 2, the exponents where the bits are 1 are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So, 2^10 +2^9 +2^8 +2^7 +2^6 +2^5 +2^3 =2024.

So, each term 2^{a-1} corresponds to a being the exponent plus 1. So, 2^{a-1}=2^{k}, so a-1=k, so a=k+1.

So, for each term 2^k in the binary representation, a is k+1. So, the exponents in the binary are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. So, a's are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, because k is the exponent in 2^k, so a =k+1. So, if 2^10 is present, then a=11, and so on.

So, A would be {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, let me check: the exponents in 2024 are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. So, a-1 is 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. Therefore, a=11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So, A is the set {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, let me verify that the sum is indeed 2024:

Sum over a in A of 2^{a-1} =2^{3} +2^{5} +2^{6} +2^{7} +2^{8} +2^{9} +2^{10}.

Which is 8 +32 +64 +128 +256 +512 +1024.

Let me compute:

8 +32=40.

40+64=104.

104+128=232.

232+256=488.

488+512=1000.

1000+1024=2024. Yes, correct.

So, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Now, the problem asks for the sum of the elements of A.

So, let's compute the sum: 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me add them step by step:

4+6=10.

10+7=17.

17+8=25.

25+9=34.

34+10=44.

44+11=55.

Wait, 4+6=10, +7=17, +8=25, +9=34, +10=44, +11=55. So, the sum is 55.

But wait, are we sure that A is exactly {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}? Let me think again. Because the exponents in 2024 are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. So, a-1=10,9,8,7,6,5,3. Thus, a=11,10,9,8,7,6,4. So yes, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

So, sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial reasoning. Because when a=1, 2^{0}=1, so if A included 1, it would contribute 1. But in this case, A doesn't include 1, because the exponents start from 3.

Wait, but 2024's binary is 11111101000, which includes 2^3, so a=4 is in A.

So, yeah, that seems correct.

But wait, another thought. The problem says that Bob is listing all finite nonempty sets B. Each such set is determined by its maximum element and the elements less than that maximum. So, the total number of such sets is the sum over a in A of 2^{a−1}. Because for each a, you can have any subset of {1,2,...,a−1} and then add a to make B. Since each B is non-empty, and a is in A, that's correct.

So yes, the sum is 2024, which is equal to the sum of 2^{a−1} for a in A. So, we converted 2024 into binary, found the exponents, added 1 to each exponent to get the elements of A, and then summed those elements.

So, the answer is 55. So, the sum of the elements of A is 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob considers all finite nonempty sets \( B \) where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The total number of such sets is 2024. We need to determine the sum of the elements in \( A \).

For each \( a \in A \), the number of sets \( B \) where \( a \) is the maximum element is \( 2^{a-1} \). This is because each such set \( B \) can be formed by taking any subset of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a-1\} \) and adding \( a \). Thus, the total number of sets Bob lists is the sum over all \( a \in A \) of \( 2^{a-1} \). Given that this sum equals 2024, we have:

\[
\sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.
\]

To find \( A \), we express 2024 in binary. The binary representation of 2024 is \( 11111101000 \), which corresponds to the sum of powers of 2:

\[
2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 = 2024.
\]

Each term \( 2^{a-1} \) implies \( a - 1 \) is the exponent, so \( a = \text{exponent} + 1 \). Thus, the elements of \( A \) are \( 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \).

The sum of the elements in \( A \) is:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55.
\]

Therefore, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
