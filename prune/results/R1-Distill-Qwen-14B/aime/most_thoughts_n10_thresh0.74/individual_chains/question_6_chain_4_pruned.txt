Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about finding the number of intersections between two graphs: one is a function y equals something, and the other is x equals something else. Both involve a lot of nested functions, so I need to break it down.

First, let me note down the functions given:

f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|. Hmm, that's the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2, all inside another absolute value. Wait, no, actually, is it | |x| - 1/2 |? Yes, that's right. So f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Similarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|, so g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Then, the two graphs are:

1. y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) 
2. x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

We need to find how many times these two graphs intersect. That is, find all pairs (x, y) such that y = 4*g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4*g(f(cos(3πy))) simultaneously.

Hmm. So each equation is a function where one variable is expressed in terms of the other, but they're both interdependent. This seems like a system of equations that might be tricky to solve directly, especially because of the trigonometric functions and the nested absolute values.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe it's easier to analyze each function separately and then see how they interact.

First, let's understand what f(x) and g(x) look like.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

The inner function |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, it will reflect any negative parts back up.

So, | |x| - 1/2 | would have a vertex at (0, 0) again, but the shape would change. Let's consider where |x| - 1/2 is negative. That happens when |x| < 1/2. So in that interval, |x| - 1/2 is negative, and the absolute value will flip it, making it 1/2 - |x|. Then, for |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

So f(x) is a piecewise function:
- For |x| <= 1/2: f(x) = 1/2 - |x|
- For |x| > 1/2: f(x) = |x| - 1/2

This makes f(x) a V-shaped graph that goes up on both sides from (0, 1/2) and then starts increasing linearly beyond |x|=1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's do the same analysis.

The inner function |x| - 1/4 is negative when |x| < 1/4. So:
- For |x| < 1/4: g(x) = 1/4 - |x|
- For |x| >=1/4: g(x) = |x| - 1/4

So g(x) is a V-shape with a peak at (0, 1/4), then slopes down to (1/4, 0) and up again on the other side.

Now, both f and g are used inside each other in the given functions.

Let me see: in the first function, y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))). So, we have sin(2πx) as the input to f, then the output of f is input to g, and then multiplied by 4.

Similarly, in the second function, x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))). So, cos(3πy) is the input to f, then g, then multiplied by 4.

Hmm. So both functions involve these transformed sine and cosine functions inside f and g.

Let me try to visualize what 4*g(f(z)) would look like, where z is sin(2πx) or cos(3πy).

First, let's think about z being a sine or cosine function. So, z ranges between -1 and 1.

So, f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|.

Let me consider the possible values of f(z). Since z is between -1 and 1, |z| is between 0 and 1.

So, |z| - 1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value, f(z) will range from 0 to 1/2.

Because when |z| is 0, f(z) = 1/2. When |z| is 1/2, f(z) is 0. When |z| is 1, f(z) is |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

So f(z) is always between 0 and 1/2. Then, g(f(z)) is g(t) where t is between 0 and 1/2.

Since g(t) is ||t| - 1/4|. But t is between 0 and 1/2, so |t| is t, so g(t) is |t - 1/4|.

So, g(f(z)) becomes |f(z) - 1/4|.

But wait, f(z) is between 0 and 1/2, so f(z) - 1/4 could be negative or positive.

Specifically, when f(z) >= 1/4, which is when f(z) is between 1/4 and 1/2, then g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4.

When f(z) < 1/4, which is when f(z) is between 0 and 1/4, then g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z).

So, g(f(z)) is a V-shaped graph with the minimum at f(z) = 1/4, g(f(z)) = 0, and slopes upward on either side.

The maximum value of g(f(z)) would occur at the extremes, where f(z) is either 0 or 1/2.

At f(z)=0, g(f(z))=1/4. At f(z)=1/2, g(f(z))=1/4.

So, g(f(z)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

Therefore, 4*g(f(z)) ranges from 0 to 1. So, 4*g(f(z)) is a function that maps z (which is sin or cos) to a value between 0 and 1.

So, for both functions y and x, the expressions 4*g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4*g(f(cos(3πy))) each take values in [0,1].

So, y is between 0 and 1, and x is between 0 and 1 as well.

Hmm. So the possible x and y values are in [0,1]. So the domain we're looking at is a square [0,1] x [0,1].

Now, to find the number of intersections, I need to find all (x,y) in [0,1]x[0,1] such that:

y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) 
x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

This seems complex, but maybe I can find symmetries or periodicity to exploit.

Let me consider the periodicity of the functions inside.

The function sin(2πx) has a period of 1, since sin(2π(x+1)) = sin(2πx + 2π) = sin(2πx). Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3, since cos(3π(y + 2/3)) = cos(3πy + 2π) = cos(3πy).

But since x and y are both in [0,1], and we're dealing with functions that are periodic over these intervals, perhaps the behavior is repetitive within [0,1].

Alternatively, maybe I can consider how many times each equation can produce a value within [0,1] and how they might intersect.

But perhaps a better approach
