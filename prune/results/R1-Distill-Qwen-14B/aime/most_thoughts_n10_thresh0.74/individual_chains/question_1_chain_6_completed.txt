Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me write that as equation (xy).

Now, from equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Simplify exponents: 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) because 1/3 is 4/12. So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's call this equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy): x y = 2^(-2/3). But y = x * 2^(-1/12), so substituting:

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which is x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Solve for x^2:

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12). Taking square roots:

x = 2^(-7/24), since sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Again, positive root.

So x is 2^(-7/24). Equation (x).

Now, from equation (y): y = x * 2^(-1/12). So plugging in x:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y is 2^(-3/8). Equation (y).

Let me recap the values I have:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-3/8)
z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me check if these satisfy the original equations.

Wait, maybe I should express all exponents with a common denominator to make it easier. Let's see:

x: exponent is -7/24
y: exponent is -3/8 = -9/24
z: exponent is -5/12 = -10/24

So all exponents are in 24ths.

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|. Let's compute this.

First, compute x^4 y^3 z^2:

x^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)
y^3 = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)
z^2 = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them together:

x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 - 9/8 -5/6)

Let me compute the exponents:

First, -7/6 -5/6 = (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.

Then, -2 -9/8 = (-16/8 -9/8) = (-25/8)

So x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)

So log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So m =25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.

Thus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Let me recompute the exponents step by step.

x = 2^(-7/24), so x^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)
y = 2^(-3/8), so y^3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)
z = 2^(-5/12), so z^2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Now, adding exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Convert all to 24 denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24

So total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.

Yes, that's correct. So log₂ is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.

So the answer is 25 + 8 = 33.


Now, let's go through the solution step by step.

We are given the system of logarithmic equations:

1. \(\log_2\left(\dfrac{x}{yz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\dfrac{y}{xz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\dfrac{z}{xy}\right) = \dfrac{1}{4}\)

**Step 1: Convert logarithmic equations to exponential form**

- From equation 1: \(\dfrac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \Rightarrow x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\)  (1a)
- From equation 2: \(\dfrac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \Rightarrow y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)  (2a)
- From equation 3: \(\dfrac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \Rightarrow z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)  (3a)

**Step 2: Substitute equations to solve for variables**

- Substitute equation (2a) into equation (1a):
  \[
  x = (xz \cdot 2^{1/3}) \cdot z \cdot 2^{1/2} = xz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}
  \]
  Simplifying, we find \(z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\), so \(z = 2^{-5/12}\).

- Substitute \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into equation (3a):
  \[
  2^{-5/12} = xy \cdot 2^{1/4} \Rightarrow xy = 2^{-2/3}
  \]

- From equation (2a), express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
  \[
  y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}
  \]
  Substituting into \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\):
  \[
  x \cdot (x \cdot 2^{-1/12}) = 2^{-2/3} \Rightarrow x^2 = 2^{-7/12} \Rightarrow x = 2^{-7/24}
  \]
  Then, \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-3/8}\).

**Step 3: Compute \(|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|\)**

- Calculate \(x^4\), \(y^3\), and \(z^2\):
  \[
  x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \quad y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \quad z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}
  \]
- Multiply them together:
  \[
  x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-25/8}
  \]
- Take the logarithm base 2:
  \[
  \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\dfrac{25}{8} \Rightarrow |\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = \dfrac{25}{8}
  \]

**Step 4: Express as fraction and find \(m + n\)**

The fraction is \(\dfrac{25}{8}\), where \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\). Thus, \(m + n = 33\).

**Final Answer:**
\(\boxed{33}\)
