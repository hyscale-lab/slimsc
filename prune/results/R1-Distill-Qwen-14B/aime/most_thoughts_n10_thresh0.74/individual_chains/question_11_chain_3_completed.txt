Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number \(z\), if \(|z| = r\), then the reciprocal \(1/z\) can be expressed as \(\overline{z}/r^2\), where \(\overline{z}\) is the complex conjugate of \(z\). So, since \(|z| = 4\), \(|z|^2 = 16\), which might come in handy later.

Let me denote \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\) because it's easier to handle in exponential form when dealing with modulus and arguments. So, \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), which means \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Now, let's substitute \(z\) into the expression. The first term is \((75 + 117i)z\). Let's compute that:

\[
(75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}
\]

Similarly, the second term is \(\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), which becomes:

\[
(96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

So, the entire expression becomes:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

I think it's easier to handle if I expand these terms using Euler's formula, which relates exponentials to sine and cosine. Remember that \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\), and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\).

Let me compute each term separately.

First term expansion:

\[
4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 4[75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta]
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this simplifies to:

\[
4[75\cos\theta + (75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta) - 117\sin\theta]
\]
\[
= 4[(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)]
\]
\[
= 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 4i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)
\]

Second term expansion:

\[
\frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = \frac{1}{4}[96\cos\theta - 96i\sin\theta + 144i\cos\theta - 144i^2\sin\theta]
\]
Again, \(i^2 = -1\), so:

\[
= \frac{1}{4}[96\cos\theta + ( -96i\sin\theta + 144i\cos\theta ) + 144\sin\theta]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{4}[(96\cos\theta + 144\sin\theta) + i(-96\sin\theta + 144\cos\theta)]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{4}(96\cos\theta + 144\sin\theta) + \frac{i}{4}(-96\sin\theta + 144\cos\theta)
\]

Now, let's combine both terms. The real parts come from the first parts of each expansion, and the imaginary parts come from the second parts.

Real part:

\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + \frac{1}{4}(96\cos\theta + 144\sin\theta)
\]

Imaginary part:

\[
4(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta) + \frac{1}{4}(-96\sin\theta + 144\cos\theta)
\]

But since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can focus on the real part expression. Let me compute that.

First, compute each term in the real part:

1. \(4 \times 75 \cos\theta = 300 \cos\theta\)
2. \(4 \times (-117) \sin\theta = -468 \sin\theta\)
3. \(\frac{1}{4} \times 96 \cos\theta = 24 \cos\theta\)
4. \(\frac{1}{4} \times 144 \sin\theta = 36 \sin\theta\)

So, combining these:

Real part = \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Combine like terms:

- For \(\cos\theta\): \(300 + 24 = 324\)
- For \(\sin\theta\): \(-468 + 36 = -432\)

So, Real part = \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\)

Hmm, okay. So the real part simplifies to \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \(\theta\). That is, I need to maximize \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\).

I remember that expressions of the form \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) can be rewritten as \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\) and \(\phi\) is some phase shift. The maximum value of this expression is then \(R\).

Wait, in this case, since the coefficients are 324 and -432, the expression is actually \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), which is \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) with A=324 and B=-432. So, the maximum value is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \(A^2 = 324^2\). Let's see, 324 is 18^2, so 324^2 = (18^2)^2 = 18^4. Let me compute 18^2 = 324, so 18^4 = 324 * 324. Hmm, 300*300=90,000, 300*24=7,200, 24*300=7,200, 24*24=576. So, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105,  (90,000 +14,400=104,400; 104,400 +576=104,976). So, A^2=104,976.

Similarly, B^2 = (-432)^2=432^2. Let's compute that. 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So 432^2= (400+32)^2=400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 + 1,024=160,000+25,600=185,600; 185,600+1,024=186,624.

So, R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Let's compute that.

What's 540^2? 500^2=250,000; 40^2=1,600; 2*500*40=40,000. So, 540^2= (500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600. Perfect! So, R=540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait a minute, is that correct? Because the expression is \(324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta = R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), and the maximum is R, which is 540. So, yes, the maximum real part is 540.

But wait, let me think again. The original expression is a combination of two terms:

1. \((75 + 117i)z\)
2. \((96 + 144i)/z\)

But when I substituted \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), I went through the expansions correctly, right? Let me just double-check the coefficients.

In the first term, after substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), we have 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}.

Expanding this, we get 4*(75 cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ -117 sinθ). So, real part: 4*(75 cosθ -117 sinθ) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Second term: (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/(4e^{iθ})) = (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ} = 24( cosθ -i sinθ) +36i (cosθ -i sinθ).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion earlier. Let me recompute the second term.

Wait, actually, I think I might have miscalculated the second term's coefficients earlier.

Wait, the second term is (96 +144i)/z, and z is 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}, so (96 +144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, when I expand that, it's 24 e^{-iθ} + 36i e^{-iθ} = 24 (cosθ - i sinθ) + 36i (cosθ - i sinθ).

Let's compute each part:

24 cosθ -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary:

Real part: 24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ) i.

So, the real part of the second term is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Therefore, when I combined the real parts from both terms, the first term had 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ, and the second term had 24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

Adding them together:

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ.

Which is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, same as before.

So, yes, my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, whose maximum is 540.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have a term like (a + ib)/z and another term like (c + id)z, the maximum might be higher. But given that we have |z|=4, the reciprocal is scaled accordingly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the fact that for any complex number \(w\), the real part of \(w + \overline{w}\) is 2 Re(w). But in this case, the expression is not symmetric in z and 1/z. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some form of optimization.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter substitution. Let me think: Let me denote \(w = z\), so that \(|w|=4\), and the expression is \((75 + 117i)w + (96 + 144i)/w\). Let me denote \(A = 75 + 117i\) and \(B = 96 + 144i\). So, the expression becomes \(A w + B / w\).

I need to find the maximum real part of \(A w + B / w\), given \(|w| =4\). So, perhaps I can write this as \(A w + \overline{B}/w^*\), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, write \(w =4 e^{i\theta}\), which I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors in the complex plane. Let me think of the expression \(A w + B /w\) as a sum of two complex numbers, each scaled differently.

But another thought: maybe using the identity that for any complex numbers a and b, Re(a + b) ≤ Re(a) + Re(b). But I don't think that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps writing the entire expression as a single complex number and then taking the real part. But I think the approach I took earlier is the way to go.

So, to recap, the real part simplifies to 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, and the maximum of this expression is 540. So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me just confirm. Let me compute 324^2 +432^2.

Wait, 324^2 is 104,976 as computed before, and 432^2=186,624. Sum is 291,600, square root is 540. So, yes, R=540. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

So, I think that's the answer.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting this into the expression, we have:

\[
(75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Expanding each term using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we compute the real parts:

1. For \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\):
   \[
   4[(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)].
   \]
   The real part is \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\).

2. For \(\frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta}\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}[(96\cos\theta + 144\sin\theta) + i(-96\sin\theta + 144\cos\theta)].
   \]
   The real part is \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\).

Combining the real parts:
\[
300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

The expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) can be rewritten as \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540\). The maximum value of this expression is \(R = 540\).

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
