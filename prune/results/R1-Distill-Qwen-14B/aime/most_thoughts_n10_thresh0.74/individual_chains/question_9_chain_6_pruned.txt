Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and also log base y of x^{4y} is equal to 10. Hmm, let me write that down to get a clearer picture.

So, the equations are:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a), I can rewrite this as x * log_x(y) = 10. So, log_x(y) = 10 / x.

Wait, another thought: since log_x(y) is the exponent I need to raise x to get y. Let me denote that exponent as k. So, if log_x(y) = k, then x^k = y. That might be useful later.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, applying the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, log_y(x) = 10 / (4y) = 5 / (2y).

But wait, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y). Because of the logarithm reciprocal property, which states that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, since log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k.

So from the first equation, log_x(y) = 10/x, which means log_y(x) = x/10.

But from the second equation, log_y(x) is 5/(2y). Therefore, we have:

x/10 = 5/(2y)

Let me write that down:

x/10 = 5/(2y)

Cross-multiplying to solve for x and y:

x * 2y = 10 * 5
2xy = 50
Divide both sides by 2:
xy = 25

Wait, so is that it? Did I just get xy = 25? Hmm, let me check if that makes sense.

But wait, I should make sure that both x and y are consistent with the original equations. Let me find x and y individually to verify.

From earlier, I have:

1. log_x(y) = 10/x
2. log_y(x) = 5/(2y) = x/10

But since xy = 25, I can express y as 25/x.

So, substituting y = 25/x into equation 1: log_x( (25/x)^x ) = 10.

Wait, let's compute this. log_x( (25/x)^x ) = x * log_x(25/x) =
