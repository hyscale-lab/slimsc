Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one thing. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, some own a garden spade, and of course, all own the candy hearts.

The numbers given are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. Also, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given for everyone.

Now, the problem says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. I need to find how many own all four—diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Hmm, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Right, because it's about overlapping sets. Let me recall how that works.

Inclusion-exclusion for four sets... Wait, I'm a bit rusty. Let me think. The formula for four sets is:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, in this problem, we also know the number of people who own exactly two and exactly three things. Hmm, maybe I can relate this to that information.

Wait, the problem says that 437 own exactly two of the things. And 234 own exactly three. So, the question is about the number who own all four, which would be exactly four.

Let me denote:
- D = diamond ring owners
- G = golf clubs owners
- S = spade owners
- C = candy hearts (which is everyone, so |C|=900)

But wait, all residents own a candy heart, so C is the universal set here. So any set intersection with C is just the set itself. Hmm, that might simplify things.

So, let me think about the problem in terms of the different
