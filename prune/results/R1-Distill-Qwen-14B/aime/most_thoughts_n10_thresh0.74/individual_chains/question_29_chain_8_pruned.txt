Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize the problem. Since both ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Let me sketch that out in my mind.

Let me assign coordinates to these rectangles to make it easier. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, AB is 107. So, point A would be at (0, 107), point B at (16, 107), and point C at (16, 0). Wait, no, because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. Let me think again.

Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB is one side, BC is another. If BC is 16 and AB is 107, then AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths. So, if I place point A at (0,0), then point B would be at (107, 0), point C at (107, 16), and point D at (0, 16). Hmm, maybe that's a better coordinate system.

But the problem says that D, E, C, F are collinear. So points D and C are on the same line as E and F. Wait, but in my initial placement, points D and C are at (0,16) and (107,16), so they lie on the same horizontal line. So E and F must also be on that line. So, rectangle EFGH must have points E and F on the same horizontal line as D and C.

Wait, but EFGH is also a rectangle. So, if E and F are on the same line as D and C, then EFGH is another rectangle
