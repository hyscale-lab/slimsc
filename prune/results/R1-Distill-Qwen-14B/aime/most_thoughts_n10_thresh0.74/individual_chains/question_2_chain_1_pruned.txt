Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC squared, where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the points given are O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, √3/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis. I can probably sketch this out to visualize.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ segment connects a point P on the x-axis to a point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. Since they're in the first quadrant, both P and Q have positive coordinates.

I need to find a point C on AB, not equal to A or B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB itself. Then, I have to find OC squared and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Hmm. So, C is a point on AB that's unique in that no other segment from F passes through it. So, how do I approach this?

First, let's parametrize the line segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, √3/2), the line AB can be found using the two-point formula.

The slope of AB is ( (√3/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) ) = (√3/2) / (-1/2) = -√3.

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -√3 (x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -√3 x + (√3)/2.

So any point C on AB can be written as (x, -√3 x + √3/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

Now, the point C must not lie on any other segment PQ from family F except for AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, what's special about AB in this family F?

Wait, AB is itself a segment from F. Let me check: length of AB is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is a member of F.

So, C is on AB, but for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, C is the only point lying on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, I need to find C on AB such that no other segment PQ (of unit length between axes) passes through it. So, C is unique in that sense.

Hmm, how do I find such a point?

Perhaps I can think about the envelope of all such segments PQ. The envelope would be a curve that is tangent to each PQ, and points inside the envelope would be on multiple PQs, while points on the envelope are only on one PQ. So, if C is on the envelope, then it's only on one PQ, which is AB in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all such segments PQ.

So, maybe I should find the envelope of the family F of segments PQ, and find where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, since each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1, since the length is 1.

Wait, because the distance between P(p,0) and Q(0,q) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2
