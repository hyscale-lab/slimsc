Okay, so I've come across this math problem, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

We have a 5x5 grid, which is 25 cells. We have 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips. The task is to place some of these chips in the grid according to specific rules.

The conditions are:

1. Each cell can contain at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
3. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
4. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous conditions.

So, I need to find the number of ways to place some chips under these conditions.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, each row must have all chips of the same color. Similarly, each column must have all chips of the same color. Wait, that's a bit conflicting because a cell is at the intersection of a row and a column. If all chips in a row are white, and all chips in a column are black, the cell where the row and column meet would need to be both white and black, which isn't possible. So, that suggests that the color assignments for rows and columns must be consistent.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If all chips in a row are white, but in that same row, the columns that intersect it must also have all chips of the same color. But if that column is black, then the cell where they meet can't have any chip because it can't be both white and black. But according to condition 1, each cell can have at most one chip, but in this case, if a row is all white and a column is all black, their intersection can't have a chip. So maybe each cell can only have a chip if its row and column are of the same color.

Wait, but the problem says that all chips in the same row have the same color, and all chips in the same column have the same color. So for each row, it's either all white, all black, or perhaps some other possibility. But if a row has any chips, all of them must be the same color. Similarly for columns.

But wait, the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color." So, if a row has any chips, they all must be the same color, and same for a column. So, for each row, it's either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, for each column.

But since each cell can have at most one chip, and each row and column must be uniform in color, how do these interact?

Wait, perhaps each row and column is assigned a color (white or black or empty), but the assignment must be consistent across the grid.

Wait, but for a cell, if its row is white and the column is white, then the cell can have a white chip. If row is white and column is black, then the cell can't have a chip because it can't be both. Similarly, if row is black and column is white, no chip. If both row and column are black, then a black chip can be placed.

Wait, so the grid is such that each cell (i,j) can have a chip only if row i and column j are
