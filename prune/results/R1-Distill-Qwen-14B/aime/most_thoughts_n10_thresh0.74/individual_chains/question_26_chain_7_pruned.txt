Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC which is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. Given sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, I remember that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB and DC must be equal. That might come in handy later.

I think I should start by finding some key elements of triangle ABC. Maybe I can find the circumradius or the coordinates of the points if I place the triangle in a coordinate system. Wait, the Asymptote code shows that point C is at the origin, A is at (10,0), and B is at (7.8, 4.4899). Interesting, so maybe I can work with coordinates?

Let me try that approach. Let's assign coordinates as per the Asymptote code. So, C is at (0,0), A is at (10,0), and B is somewhere in the plane. Wait, but in the problem statement, AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Wait, but if A is at (10,0) and C is at (0,0), then AC is 10 units, which matches. Then AB is 5, so the distance between A(10,0) and B(x,y) should be 5. Similarly, BC is 9, so the distance between B(x,y) and C(0,0) is 9.

Let me write down the equations:

Distance from A(10,0) to B(x,y) is 5:
√[(x-10)^2 + (y-0)^2] = 5
So, (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25 ...(1)

Distance from B(x,y) to C(0,0) is 9:
√[(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2] = 9
So, x^2 + y^2 = 81 ...(2)

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

x^2 + y^2 - [(x-10)^2 + y^2] = 81 - 25
Expanding (x-10)^2: x^2 -20x +100
So, x^2 + y^2 - (x^2 -20x +100 + y^2) = 56
Simplify: 20x -100 =56 → 20x=156 → x=156/20=7.8

So, x=7.8. Now plug back into equation (2):

(7.8)^2 + y^2 =81 → 60.84 + y^2=81 → y^2=20.16 → y=√20.16. Let me compute that.

√20.16: 4.4899 approximately. So, y≈4.4899. So, point B is at (7.8,4.4899), which matches the Asymptote code. Great, so the coordinates are:

A(10,0), B(7.8,4.4899), C(0,0).

Now, I need to find point D where the tangents at B and C meet. Since the tangents from D to ω at B and C are equal, so DB=DC.

I remember that the tangent from a point to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC. Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

So, to find D, I need to find the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. Alternatively, since D is the exsymmedian point or something similar? Hmm, maybe I can find the equations of the tangents and solve for D.

First, I need the circumcenter O of triangle ABC.

How to find circumcenter O? It's the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.

Let me compute the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

Wait, AB is from (10,0) to (7.8,4.4899). Let me compute the midpoint of AB:

Midpoint M1: ((10+7.8)/2, (0 +4.4899)/2) = (17.8/2, 4.4899/2) = (8.9, 2.24495)

Slope of AB: (4.4899-0)/(7.8-10)=4.4899/(-2.2)= -2.0408 approx.

So, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal, so 1/2.0408≈0.489 approx.

Wait, exact value: Slope of AB is (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) = (4.4899)/( -2.2). Let me compute this exactly. Wait, 4.4899 is approximately 4.4899, but maybe it's better to keep it symbolic.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use exact expressions.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute O using the formula for the circumradius.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps I can compute O by solving the perpendicular bisectors.

Let me find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Midpoint M1 is (8.9, 2.24495). The slope of AB is (4.4899-0)/(7.8-10)=4.4899/(-2.2)= -2.0408 approximately. So, the perpendicular bisector has slope reciprocal positive: 1/(2.0408)= approx 0.489, which is 0.489 approx.

But let's compute it exactly. Let me compute the exact slope.

Slope of AB: (y_B - y_A)/(x_B - x_A) = (4.4899 - 0)/(7.8 -10) =4.4899/(-2.2)= -2.04081818...

So, the negative reciprocal is 1/(2.04081818...)= approx 0.489. But perhaps it's better to keep it symbolic. Let me denote the slope as m, then the perpendicular bisector is:

y - 2.24495 = m(x -8.9), where m is positive 1/(slope of AB).

Hmm, perhaps another approach is better. Let me compute the circumradius.

Using the formula for the circumradius R = (a b c)/(4Δ), where a, b, c are sides, and Δ is area.

Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

Wait, so a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

Compute semi-perimeter: s=(5+9+10)/2=24/2=12.

Area Δ = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = √[12(12-9)(12-10)(12-5)] = √[12*3*2*7] = √(504) = √(16*31.5)=4√31.5. Wait, but 504 factors: 504=16*31.5? Wait, no.

Wait, 504= 16*31.5? Wait, 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. So, √504=√(16*31.5)=4√31.5. But √31.5 is √(63/2)= (√63)/√2= (3√7)/√2= 3√14 / 2. So, overall, Δ=4*(3√14/2)= 6√14.

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

Δ = √[12*3*2*7] = √(12*3*2*7) = √(504). 504= 16*31.5? Wait, 504= 16*31.5, yes because 16*30=480 and 16*1.5=24, total 504.

So, √504=√(16*31.5)=4√31.5.

But 31.5=63/2, so √31.5=√(63/2)= (√63)/√2= (3√7)/√2= (3√14)/2. So, Δ=4*(3√14/2)= 6√14. So, area is 6√14.

So, R= (a b c)/(4Δ)= (5*9*10)/(4*6√14)= (450)/(24√14)= (75)/(4√14)= (75√14)/(4*14)= (75√14)/56.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, R = (a b c)/(4Δ) = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

450 ÷ 6 = 75; 24 ÷6=4.

So, 75/(4√14). To rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

75√14/(4*14)=75√14/56.

So, R=75√14/56≈ but maybe I don't need the approximate value right now.

Wait, but maybe I can find the coordinates of the circumcenter O.

Since the triangle has coordinates A(10,0), B(7.8,4.4899), C(0,0). Let me compute the perpendicular bisectors.

First, find the midpoint of AB: ( (10+7.8)/2, (0 +4.4899)/2 ) = (17.8/2, 4.4899/2 )= (8.9, 2.24495).

Slope of AB: (4.4899 -0)/(7.8 -10)=4.4899/(-2.2)= -2.0408. So, the perpendicular bisector will have slope reciprocal and positive: 1/2.0408≈0.489.

Wait, let's compute the slope exactly. Slope of AB is (y_B - y_A)/(x_B -x_A)= (4.4
