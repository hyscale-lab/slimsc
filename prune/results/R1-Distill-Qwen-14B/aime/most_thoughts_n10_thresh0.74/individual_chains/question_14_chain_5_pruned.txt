Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. I need to find the largest such N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, and then add them together.

Let me break this down. First, I need to find N. Let's think about N as a four-digit number, so let's write it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits, with A not zero. So N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

Now, the property is that if you change any one digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 and leaving the others as they are should result in a number divisible by 7.

So that gives me four conditions:

1. Changing A to 1: The number becomes 1BCD, which should be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: The number becomes A1CD, which should be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: The number becomes AB1D, which should be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: The number becomes ABC1, which should be divisible by 7.

So I have four conditions related to divisibility by 7. My goal is to find the largest four-digit number N that satisfies all four conditions.

Since N is the greatest such number, I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies all these conditions. However, that might take a long time, so maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about each condition in terms of modular arithmetic. Remember, when we change a digit to 1, the new number must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

First, let's denote N as 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

When we change A to 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Let's call this N1. So,

N1 = 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D.

Similarly, changing B to 1 gives N2 = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D.

Changing C to 1 gives N3 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D.

Changing D to 1 gives N4 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7, so N1 ≡ 0 mod7, N2 ≡0 mod7, N3≡0 mod7, N4≡0 mod7.

So, let's write each of these in terms of N and the digit being changed.

Let me express each N1, N2, N3, N4 in terms of N:

N1: Changing A to 1. Since A is the thousands digit, changing it to 1 gives (N - A*1000) + 1*1000 = N + (1 - A)*1000.

Similarly, N2: Changing B to 1 is (N - B*100) + 1*100 = N + (1 - B)*100.

N3: Changing C to 1 is N - C*10 + 1*10 = N + (1 - C)*10.

N4: Changing D to 1 is N - D + 1 = N + (1 - D).

Since each of these must be divisible by 7, we have:

N + (1 - A)*1000 ≡ 0 mod7,

N + (1 - B)*100 ≡ 0 mod7,

N + (1 - C)*10 ≡ 0 mod7,

N + (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod7.

So, each of these expressions must be 0 mod7.

Let me denote N ≡ k mod7, where k is between 0 and 6.

Then, for each condition:

1. k + (1 - A)*1000 ≡0 mod7,

2. k + (1 - B)*100 ≡0 mod7,

3. k + (1 - C)*10 ≡0 mod7,

4. k + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

So, for each condition, I can write:

(1): (1 - A)*1000 ≡ (-k) mod7,

(2): (1 - B)*100 ≡ (-k) mod7,

(3): (1 - C)*10 ≡ (-k) mod7,

(4): (1 - D) ≡ (-k) mod7.

Hmm, interesting. So from each condition, I can get an equation involving the digit and k. Let me compute 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo7 first because that might simplify the equations.

Computing powers of 10 modulo7:

10^0 = 1 mod7.

10^1 = 10 mod7 = 3.

10^2 = 100 mod7. Let's compute 100 /7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100 ≡2 mod7.

10^3 = 1000 mod7. Since 1000 = 10^3, which is 10^2 *10, so 2*3=6 mod7.

So:

10^1 mod7=3,

10^2 mod7=2,

10^3 mod7=6,

10^0 mod7=1.

So, now, let's rewrite each condition:

(1): (1 - A)*1000 ≡ (1 - A)*6 ≡ (-k) mod7,

(2): (1 - B)*100 ≡ (1 - B)*2 ≡ (-k) mod7,

(3): (1 - C)*10 ≡ (1 - C)*3 ≡ (-k) mod7,

(4): (1 - D) ≡ (-k) mod7.

So, for each digit, we have:

(1) 6*(1 - A) ≡ -k mod7,

(2) 2*(1 - B) ≡ -k mod7,

(3) 3*(1 - C) ≡ -k mod7,

(4) (1 - D) ≡ -k mod7.

So, all four equations equal to -k mod7.

Therefore, all four expressions on the left must be congruent to each other mod7.

So, 6*(1 - A) ≡ 2*(1 - B) mod7,

and 6*(1 - A) ≡ 3*(1 - C) mod7,

and 6*(1 - A) ≡ (1 - D) mod7.

So, let's write these as:

6*(1 - A) ≡ 2*(1 - B) mod7,

6*(1 - A) ≡ 3*(1 - C) mod7,

6*(1 - A) ≡ (1 - D) mod7.

Similarly, since 2*(1 - B) ≡ 3*(1 - C) mod7,

and 2*(1 - B) ≡ (1 - D) mod7,

and 3*(1 - C) ≡ (1 - D) mod7.

So, all four expressions are equal, so we can set them all equal to some common value mod7, say, m.

But perhaps it's better to express each digit in terms of A, or find relations between the digits.

Let me write the equations:

From (1) and (2):

6*(1 - A) ≡ 2*(1 - B) mod7.

Let me divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed).

3*(1 - A) ≡ (1 - B) mod7.

So, 3*(1 - A) ≡ (1 - B) mod7.

Similarly, from (1) and (3):

6*(1 - A) ≡ 3*(1 - C) mod7.

Divide both sides by 3:

2*(1 - A) ≡ (1 - C) mod7.

So, 2*(1 - A) ≡ (1 - C) mod7.

From (1) and (4):

6*(1 - A) ≡ (1 - D) mod7.

So, 6*(1 - A) ≡ (1 - D) mod7.

So, now, we can express B, C, D in terms of A.

Let me denote x = 1 - A mod7.

Then,

From equation (1) and (2):

3x ≡ (1 - B) mod7 => 1 - B ≡ 3x mod7 => B ≡ 1 - 3x mod7.

Similarly, from (1) and (3):

2x ≡ (1 - C) mod7 => C ≡ 1 - 2x mod7.

From (1) and (4):

6x ≡ (1 - D) mod7 => D ≡ 1 - 6x mod7.

So, now, we have expressions for B, C, D in terms of x, where x = 1 - A mod7.

But A is a digit from 1 to 9 (since it's the thousands digit), so A can be 1-9, which means x can be (1 - A) mod7, which can take values from (1-1)=0 mod7 up to (1-9)= -8 ≡ -1 mod7, so x can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, let's compute x for A from 1 to 9:

A:1, x=0

A:2, x= -1≡6 mod7

A:3, x= -2≡5 mod7

A:4, x= -3≡4 mod7

A:5, x= -4≡3 mod7

A:6, x= -5≡2 mod7

A:7, x= -6≡1 mod7

A:8, x= -7≡0 mod7

A:9, x= -8≡-1≡6 mod7

So, x can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 depending on A.

Wait, but for A=1, x=0.

For A=8, x=0.

So, x can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, for each possible x, we can find B, C, D in terms of x, and then find the corresponding digits.

But since digits are 0-9, we'll have to make sure that B, C, D as computed from x are digits (i.e., 0-9), but modulo7, so they might wrap around.

Wait, let me think. Since B is computed as 1 - 3x mod7, but B is a digit (0-9). So, if 1 - 3x mod7 gives, say, 8, then B would be 8 mod7=1, but that would wrap it around. But actually, wait, 1 - 3x could be negative or larger than 7, so we have to compute (1 - 3x) mod7, then add 7 if necessary to get it into 0-6, but since B is a digit, 0-9, we can have B = (1 - 3x) mod7, but if it's negative, add 7.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute (1 - 3x) mod7, and then B is that value mod7, but since B is a digit, it can be 0-9, but if (1 - 3x) mod7 is, say, 5, then B can be 5 or 12, but 12 is not a digit. So, actually, B must be equal to (1 - 3x) mod7, which is in 0-6, perhaps.

Wait, no, because in the equation 3x ≡ (1 - B) mod7, so (1 - B) ≡ 3x mod7. So, (1 - B) can be any integer, but since B is a digit (0-9), (1 - B) is between -9 and 1.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of B ≡ 1 - 3x mod7, so B can be written as (1 - 3x) + 7k, for some integer k, such that B is between 0 and 9.

Similarly for C and D.

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe instead, since we need to find N as large as possible, we can iterate A from 9 downwards, compute x=1 - A mod7, then compute B, C, D, and check if they are digits (0-9). If they are, then N is a candidate, and since we're going from high A downwards, the first such N we find should be the maximum.

So, let's try this approach.

Start with A=9:

A=9:

x=1 -9 mod7= -8 mod7= -1 mod7=6.

So x=6.

Then,

B ≡1 - 3x mod7 = 1 - 3*6=1 -18= -17 mod7.

Compute -17 mod7:

7*2=14, 7*3=21. 17-14=3, so -17 ≡ -3 mod7, which is 4 mod7.

So B=4.

Similarly,

C ≡1 -2x mod7 =1 -2*6=1 -12= -11 mod7.

-11 mod7: 7*2=14, 14-11=3. So -11 ≡ -3 mod7=4.

So C=4.

D ≡1 -6x mod7=1 -6*6=1 -36= -35 mod7=0.

Since 35 is divisible by7, so D=0.

So digits are:

A=9, B=4, C=4, D=0.

So the number is 9440.

But wait, is this the largest possible? Let's check if this number satisfies the original condition.

Wait, let me verify N=9440.

Change each digit to 1 and check divisibility by7.

1. Change A to1: 1440.

Check if 1440 is divisible by7.

Compute 1440 /7: 7*205=1435, 1440-1435=5. So 1440≡5 mod7. Not divisible by7. So N=9440 doesn't satisfy the condition. So this N is invalid.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing B, C, D. Let me recheck.

A=9, x=6.

So, B=1 -3x mod7=1-18 mod7= -17 mod7.

Compute 7*2=14, so -17 +14= -3, so -3 mod7=4. So B=4.

Similarly, C=1 -2x=1-12=-11 mod7.

-11 +14=3, so C=3? Wait, no. Wait, -11 mod7.

Wait, let's compute 7*2=14. 14-11=3, so -11 ≡3 mod7.

Wait, so perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, 1 -2x =1-12= -11.

-11 mod7 is the same as (-11 +14)=3. So C=3.

Similarly, D=1 -6x=1-36= -35.

-35 mod7=0, so D=0.

So, A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0.

So the number is 9430.

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation for C earlier.

Wait, x=6.

C ≡1 -2x mod7 =1 -12= -11 mod7=3.

So, C=
