Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, here's what we know:

We have a list of positive integers with three key properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Our goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I understand everything correctly.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of items, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list, which is interesting.

Alright, so let's start by considering the mode. The mode is 9, and it's unique. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears 'k' times. Then, all other numbers can appear at most 'k-1' times.

Next, the sum of all items is 30. So, the total sum is fixed. Let's also remember that all numbers are positive integers.

Now, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. So, if the median is, say, m, then m isn't in the list. Also, m must be an integer, which means the list either has an odd number of elements (so m is the exact middle number) or an even number of elements where the average of the two middle numbers is an integer not in the list.

Wait a minute, if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. For that average to be an integer, those two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd. But since the median is a positive integer not in the list, it can't be equal to either of those two middle numbers. So, it's possible that the two middle numbers are different, their average is an integer, and that average isn't present in the list.

But let's think about the implications. Let me consider both cases: whether the number of elements is odd or even.

Case 1: The list has an odd number of elements, say 2n+1 elements. Then, the median is the (n+1)th element when sorted. Since the median isn't in the list, that means the (n+1)th element is m, which is not present. But wait, how can the (n+1)th element not be present if it's the median? That seems conflicting because the median is determined by the elements in the list. Wait, no. Wait, no, because the median is the middle value, which must be one of the elements if the number of elements is odd. Wait, but in this problem, it says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So, that implies that the list must have an even number of elements because
