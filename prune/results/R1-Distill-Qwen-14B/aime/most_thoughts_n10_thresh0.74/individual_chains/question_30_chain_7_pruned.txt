Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, alright. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. Since ω is a 13th root and ω ≠ 1, it's one of the primitive roots, right? So, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12.

The expression I need to compute is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that down:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm. I wonder if there's a way to simplify this product. Maybe I can factor it or relate it to some known polynomial.

Wait, let's think about the factors. Each term is a quadratic in ω^k: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me denote x = ω^k, so each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². I can rewrite this quadratic as x² - 2x + 2.

So, each term is x² - 2x + 2, where x is ω^k. So, the product becomes:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2)

Wait, but x is ω^k, so for each k, x runs through all the 13th roots of unity. But wait, ω^0 = 1, so when k=0, x=1. Let me check the term when k=0:

When k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, the first term is 1. Alright.

So, the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Hmm.

I know that for roots of unity, certain products can be related to cyclotomic polynomials. The cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial over the integers for primitive nth roots of unity. For prime n, like 13, Φ_13(x) is x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1.

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Let me think differently.

Each term is (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k. So, perhaps I can consider the product over all x of (x² - 2x + 2), where x ranges over all 13th roots of unity except x=1, because when k=0, we already handled that term separately.

Wait, but when k=0, x=1, and the term is 1. So, the entire product is the product over all x where x^13 = 1, of (x² - 2x + 2). But wait, that can't be because when x=1, (1² - 2*1 + 2) = 1, so including x=1 doesn't change the product. Hmm, maybe I can consider the product over all x with x^13=1 of (x² -2x +2).

But then the product would be the product of (x² - 2x + 2) for each root x of x^13 = 1
