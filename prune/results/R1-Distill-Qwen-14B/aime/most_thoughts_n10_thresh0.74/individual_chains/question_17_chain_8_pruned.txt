Alright, so I've got this problem about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q. 

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area (SA) is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume (V) is lwh. 

Given that SA = 54 and V = 23, I have two equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose all eight vertices, so the diagonal is the maximum distance from the center to any vertex. 

The space diagonal (d) of a box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, radius r = d/2, and thus r² = (d²)/4. Therefore, r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4. So, I need to minimize (l² + w² + h²) because that will give me the minimal sphere radius squared.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Actually, the sphere must be able to contain the box regardless of its orientation. But wait, actually, the sphere is centered at the center of the box, right? Because the minimal sphere that can contain the box would be centered at the box's center, with radius equal to half the space diagonal. So, yes, the radius is half the space diagonal. So, to minimize r, I need to minimize the space diagonal, which is equivalent to minimizing l² + w² + h².

So, the problem reduces to minimizing l² + w² + h² given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

Hmm, okay. So, I have an optimization problem with constraints.

Let me consider using Lagrange multipliers here. But maybe there's a better way, perhaps using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

Wait, let's think about the variables. Let me denote x = l, y = w, z = h.

So, I have:

2(xy + xz + yz) = 54 → xy + xz + yz = 27

and

xyz = 23

I need to minimize x² + y² + z².

I recall that in such optimization problems under symmetric constraints, the minimal or maximal occurs when variables are equal. But in this case, the constraints are not symmetric in a way that would allow all variables to be equal. Let me check.

Suppose x = y = z. Then, xyz = x³ =23 → x= cube root(23). Then, xy + xz + yz = 3x² =27 → x²=9 → x=3. But 3³=27 ≠23. So, that doesn't satisfy both constraints. So, variables can't all be equal.

So, maybe the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let me assume that x = y. Then, let's see.

Let x = y, so we have variables x, x, z.

Then, the equations become:

2(x² + 2xz) =54 → x² + 2xz =27

and

x² z =23

I need to minimize 2x² + z².

So, from the first equation, x² + 2xz =27, let me solve for z.

x² + 2xz =27

Let me rearrange:

2xz =27 -x²

z = (27 -x²)/(2x)

Now, substitute into the second equation:

x² * z =23

So,

x² * [ (27 -x²)/(2x) ] =23

Simplify:

x²*(27 -x²) =46x

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠0, which it can't be since dimensions are positive):

x*(27 -x²) =46

So,

27x -x³ =46

→ x³ -27x +46=0

So, let me solve the cubic equation x³ -27x +46=0.

Let me try rational roots. Potential roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test x=2: 8 -54 +46= (8+46)=54-54=0. Yes! So x=2 is a root.

So, factor out (x-2):

Divide x³ -27x +46 by x-2.

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

          2   4  -46

      1  2  -23  0

So, the cubic factors as (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0.

So, the other roots are solutions to x² +2x -23=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

We discard negative roots because lengths are positive, so x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, the roots are x=2, x= -1 +2√6, and x= -1 -2√6 (which is negative, so discard).

So, the solutions for x are 2 and -1 +2√6. Let me check if x=2 is valid.

If x=2, then from earlier, z=(27 -x²)/(2x) = (27 -4)/4=23/4=5.75.

So, z=5.75. Then, the variables would be x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

Check the volume: 2*2*5.75=23, which is correct.

Now, let's compute 2x² + z² for x=2:

2*(4) + (5.75)^2=8 + 33.0625=41.0625.

Alternatively, for x= -1 +2√6, which is approximately 3.898, let's compute z.

z=(27 -x²)/(2x). Let's compute x²:

x= -1 +2√6; x²= (1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2)=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, z=(27 - (25 -4√6))/(2x) = (2 +4√6)/(2x)= (1 +2√6)/x.

But x= -1 +2√6.

So, z= (1 +2√6)/(-1 +2√6).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 -2√6):

z= [ (1 +2√6)(-1 -2√6) ] / [ (-1 +2√6)(-1 -2√6) ]

Compute denominator: (-1)^2 - (2√6)^2 =1 -24= -23.

Compute numerator: (1)(-1) +1*(-2√6) +2√6*(-1) +2√6*(-2√6)

= -1 -2√6 -2√6 -24

= -1 -4√6 -24

= -25 -4√6

So, z= (-25 -4√6)/(-23)= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, z= (25 +4√6)/23.

Now, compute 2x² + z².

We already have x²=25 -4√6.

So, 2x²=2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

z²= [ (25 +4√6)/23 ]².

Let me compute that:

(25 +4√6)^2 =25² + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2=625 +200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, z²= (721 +200√6)/(23^2)= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, now, 2x² + z²= (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me compute this:

First, convert 50 and -8√6 to over 529 denominator.

50 =50 *529/529=26450/529

-8√6= (-8√6)*529/529= (-4232√6)/529

So, 2x² + z²= [26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6]/529.

Combine like terms:

26450 +721=27171

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4032√6)

So, 2x² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hmm, that's a negative value under the square root?

Wait, no, I'm just adding numbers. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, hold on. 2x² + z² is 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Which is 50 + (721)/529 -8√6 + (200√6)/529.

Compute each term:

50 = 50

721/529 ≈721/529≈1.362

-8√6≈-8*2.449≈-19.595

200√6/529≈200*2.449/529≈489.8/529≈0.922.

So, adding these:

50 +1.362=51.362

-19.595 +0.922≈-18.673.

So, 51.362 -18.673≈32.689.

So, approximately 32.689. 

Wait, but when x=2, 2x² + z²=41.0625, which is about 41.06.

Wait, but for x= -1 +2√6≈3.898, 2x² + z²≈32.689, which is smaller. So, that seems better.

So, perhaps x=-1 +2√6, y=x, z=(25 +4√6)/23 gives a smaller value of 2x² + z² than x=2.

So, the minimal occurs when two variables are equal to x=-1 +2√6, and the third is z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Wait, but is this the minimal? How do I know it's the smallest? Because when I assumed x=y, I found a lower value, but perhaps there's a case where all three variables are different that gives an even lower value?

Hmm, that's a good point. Maybe I can't just assume two variables are equal. Let me think.

In optimization problems with symmetry, sometimes assuming two variables equal gives the extremum, but sometimes not. So, perhaps I need a more general approach.

Let me try to use Lagrange multipliers.

We need to minimize f(x,y,z)=x² + y² + z², given the constraints:

g(x,y,z)=xy + yz + zx=27

and h(x,y,z)=xyz=23.

So, set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx -27) - μ(xyz -23)

Then, take partial derivatives and set them to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ y z =0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y =2y - λ(x + z) - μ x z=0

∂L/∂z =2z - λ(x + y) - μ x y=0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx=27

xyz=23

So, we have a system of equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ y z

2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ x z

3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ x y

4. xy + yz + zx=27

5. xyz=23

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe I can subtract equations to find relations between variables.

Subtract equation 1 and 2:

2x -2y = λ(y + z -x - z) + μ y z - μ x z

Simplify:

2(x - y) = λ(y -x) + μ z (y -x)

Factor (x - y):

2(x - y) = -(x - y)(λ + μ z)

So, either x = y, or 2 = -(λ + μ z)

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 - equation3:

2x -2z = λ(y + z -x - y) + μ y z - μ x y

Simplify:

2(x - z) = λ(z -x) + μ y (z -x)

Factor (x - z):

2(x - z) =-(x - z)(λ + μ y )

So, either x=z, or 2= -(λ + μ y )

Similarly, subtracting equations 2-3:

2y -2z = λ(x + z -x - y) + μ x z - μ x y

Simplify:

2(y - z) = λ(z - y) + μ x (z - y)

Factor (y - z):

2(y - z) = -(y - z)(λ + μ x )

So, either y=z, or 2= -(λ + μ x )

So, from these, either variables are equal, or some expressions in λ and μ are equal. 

If we suppose that x ≠ y ≠ z, then:

From first subtraction: 2 = -(λ + μ z )

From second subtraction: 2 = -(λ + μ y )

From third subtraction: 2 = -(λ + μ x )

So, if x≠y≠z, then:

λ + μ z = -2

λ + μ y = -2

λ + μ x = -2

Which implies that μ z = μ y = μ x

If μ ≠0, then z = y =x. But this would mean x=y=z, which earlier we saw doesn't satisfy the constraints.

Alternatively, if μ=0, then λ = -2.

But then, from the first equation:

2x = λ(y + z) +0 → 2x = -2(y + z) → x = -(y + z)

But since x, y, z are positive lengths, x cannot be negative. So, this is impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is that at least two variables are equal.

So, so far, I see that either two variables are equal, or all three are equal, but all three equal doesn't satisfy the constraints, so likely two variables equal.

Earlier, I tried x=y, and found a solution.

Similarly, I can try x=z or y=z, but due to the symmetry, the minimal should be same in all cases.

So, the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, as I did earlier.

So, going back, when I assumed x=y, I found that 2x² + z² is either about 41 or about 32.689, with the lower one when x is approximately 3.898.

So, that's the minimal.

Thus, the minimal value of l² + w² + h² is approximately 32.689, but let me compute it exactly.

Earlier, I had:

2x² + z²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529

Wait, but that can't be right because 50 is just 2x² (since x²=25 -4√6, so 2x²=50 -8√6). Then, z²= (25 +4√6)^2 /23²= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, adding 2x² + z²= (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write all terms over 529.

50 =50*(529)/529=26450/529

-8√6= -8√6*(529)/529= -4232√6/529

721/529 remains as is.

200√6/529 remains as is.

So,

2x² + z²= (26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6)/529

Combine like terms:

26450 +721=27171

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4032√6)

So, 2x² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529

Hmm, that seems complicated. Let me see if this can be simplified.

Wait, 27171 and 4032, let me see if they have a common factor. 4032 = 2^6 *3^2 *7. 27171 divided by 3: 2+7+1+7+1=18, which is divisible by 3. 27171/3=9057. 9057/3=3019. 3019 is prime? Let me check.

Wait, 3019 divided by 13: 13*232=3016, 3019-3016=3 → no. 17: 17*177=3009, 3019-3009=10→ no. 19: 19*158=3002, 3019-3002=17→ no. 23: 23*131=3013, 3019-3013=6→ no. So, maybe 3019 is prime.

So, 27171=3*3*3019.

4032=2^6 *3^2 *7.

So, 27171 and 4032 share a common factor of 9.

So, let's factor numerator:

27171 -4032√6 =9*(3019) -9*(448√6) =9*(3019 -448√6)

So, numerator is 9*(3019 -448√6).

Denominator is 529=23².

So, 2x² + z²=9*(3019 -448√6)/529.

Wait, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute r² as (2x² + z²)/4.

So, r²= [ (27171 -4032√6)/529 ] /4 = (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, but 27171 and 4032 can be divided by 3.

27171 ÷3=9057, 4032 ÷3=1344.

So, numerator becomes 3*(9057 -1344√6). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps 27171 -4032√6 is the minimal, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, wait, when I let x= -1 +2√6, then x= approximately 3.898, so x squared is (approx) 15.194.

So, 2x²≈30.388.

z=(25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

z squared≈2.289.

So, 2x² + z²≈30.388 +2.289≈32.677, which aligns with the previous approximate calculation.

So, 32.677 is about the value of 2x² + z², so the exact value is (27171 -4032√6)/529.

But let me see if that can be simplified. Wait, 27171=23² *11. Hmm, wait, 23² is 529, 529 *51=27079, which is close but not 27171. So, not really.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when the variables are in a particular proportion. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of symmetric functions.

Let me denote S =x+y+z, P=xy + yz + zx=27, and Q=xyz=23.

But I don't know S. Wait, but perhaps I can relate x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = S² - 2P.

So, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54.

Therefore, to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize S².

So, perhaps I can find the minimal possible value of S, given P=27, Q=23.

Hmm, I remember that for positive numbers, the minimal sum S occurs when variables are equal, but in our case, variables can't be equal because of the volume constraint.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the inequality that relates S, P, and Q.

Wait, for positive real numbers, there are several inequalities, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps use the AM ≥ GM inequality on the variables.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps consider that for positive real numbers x, y, z, the following holds: x² + y² + z² ≥ ( (x + y + z)^2 )/3.

But since I need to minimize x² + y² + z², which is S² -54, and S is sqrt( x² + y² + z² + 54 ), but this seems circular.

Alternatively, perhaps think of x, y, z as roots of a cubic equation.

Let me consider the cubic equation t^3 - S t^2 + P t - Q=0 → t^3 - S t^2 +27 t -23=0.

Since x, y, z are positive real numbers, the cubic must have three positive real roots.

The discriminant of the cubic must be positive for three real roots.

The discriminant D=18SPQ -4S³Q + S²Q² -4P³ -27Q².

Wait, I might have misremembered the discriminant formula. Let me check.

The discriminant of a cubic ax³ +bx² +cx +d is 18abcd -4b³d +b²c² -4ac³ -27a²d².

In our case, a=1, b=-S, c=27, d=-23.

So, discriminant D=18*(1)*(-S)*(27)*(-23) -4*(-S)^3*(-23) + (-S)^2*(27)^2 -4*(1)*(27)^3 -27*(1)^2*(-23)^2.

Let me compute each term:

1. 18*1*(-S)*27*(-23)=18*S*27*23=18*27*23*S. 18*27=486, 486*23=11178. So, 11178 S.

2. -4*(-S)^3*(-23)= -4*(-S)^3*(-23)= -4*(S^3)*(23)= -92 S³.

3. (-S)^2*(27)^2= S² *729=729 S².

4. -4*(1)*(27)^3= -4*19683= -78732.

5. -27*(1)^2*(-23)^2= -27*529= -14283.

So, D=11178 S -92 S³ +729 S² -78732 -14283.

Simplify constants: -78732 -14283= -93015.

So, D= -92 S³ +729 S² +11178 S -93015.

For three real roots, D>0.

But solving this inequality for S is complicated. Maybe it's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of substituting variables in terms of each other.

Wait, maybe I can write one variable in terms of the others.

Let me write z=27/(xy + xz + yz)= no, wait, that's not correct. Wait, P=27, so z=(27 -xy)/(x + y).

Wait, no, from xy + yz + zx=27, we can write z= (27 -xy)/(x + y).

Then, the volume: xyz=23 → x y z= x y * (27 -xy)/(x + y)=23.

So, let me denote A=xy, then:

x y * (27 - A)/(x + y) =23.

But x + y = S', and A=xy.

So, A*(27 - A)/(S')
