Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties.

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And the question is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, the list is made up of positive integers. So all the numbers are ≥1.

The sum is 30. So whatever numbers we have, when added up, they equal 30.

The unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number. And it's unique, so no other number can have the same frequency as 9.

The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So the median is some integer, but it's not one of the numbers in the list. Interesting.

Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's recall what median means. For a list ordered in non-decreasing order, the median is the middle value. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers.

But in this problem, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, but it's not present in the list. That can't be, because in an odd-length list, the middle element is part of the list. So the only way the median is not in the list is if the list has an even number of elements, and the median is the average of two middle numbers, which isn't present in the list.

So that suggests the list must have an even number of elements because if it's odd, the median is in the list, which contradicts the third property.

So the list has an even number of elements, say 2k elements. The median would be (a_k + a_{k+1})/2, which is an integer, but not in the list.

Wait, but the median is a positive integer, so (a_k + a_{k+1}) must be even, because when divided by 2, it's an integer.

So the sum of a_k and a_{k+1} is even, meaning they are both even or both odd.

But the median is a positive integer, so (a_k + a_{k+1})/2 ≥1.

Also, since the median is not in the list, that means that a_k and a_{k+1} are both different from the median. Hmm, but wait, a_k and a_{k+1} could be the same as each other but different from the median. Or they could be different.

Wait, but the median is (a_k + a_{k+1})/2, and it's not present in the list. So both a_k and a_{k+1} must be such that their average is not among the numbers in the list.

Let me think about that. For example, if a_k and a_{k+1} are both 8, then the median would be 8. But 8 is not the mode, so it's possible, but in that case, the median would be 8, which would appear in the list, which would conflict with the condition that the median doesn't appear in the list. Wait, no, because if 8 is in the list, but it's not the mode. Because the mode is 9. So 8 can be in the list, but it's not the mode.

Wait, but if a_k and a_{k+1} are both 8, then the median is 8, which is in the list, leading to a conflict. So that's not allowed.

So, a_k and a_{k+1} can't both be 8, because then the median is 8, which is in the list. Similarly, if they are both 10, the median is 10, which would have to not be in the list.

Wait, but 10 could be in the list, but the median is 10, which would be in the list, so that's not allowed either.

So, more generally, a_k and a_{k+1} must be such that their average is not present in the list.

So, perhaps, a_k and a_{k+1} are consecutive numbers. For example, 7 and 9. Then the median is 8, which is not in the list. So that could work.

Alternatively, if a_k is 7 and a_{k+1} is 9, the median
