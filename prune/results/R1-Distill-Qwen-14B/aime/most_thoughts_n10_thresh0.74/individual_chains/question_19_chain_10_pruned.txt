Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Alright, let me start by recalling some properties of triangles, especially those involving the circumradius (R), inradius (r), circumcenter (O), and incenter (I).

First, I know that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle through the formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle and Δ is the area.

The inradius r is given by:

r = Δ/s

where s is the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.

Given that R is 13 and r is 6, I can note those down:

R = 13
r = 6

The problem also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, that seems important. I need to figure out how this condition relates the inradius and the circumradius.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) is given by the formula:

OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r))

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall. Yes, I think that's right: OI² = R² - 2Rr.

So OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI:

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13.

So OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but the problem also says that IA is perpendicular to OI. So the line IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, how can I use that?

I think I need to consider the coordinates or perhaps some vector relationships. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system would help.

Let me try to set up a coordinate system where point I is at the origin (0, 0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is a line from I (origin) to O. Let's denote the coordinates of O as (h, k). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the vector from I to O, which is (h, k). So the vector IA must be perpendicular to (h, k).

But wait, IA is a line from I to A, which is from (0,0) to A's coordinates. Let me denote point A as (x, y). Then the vector IA is (x, y), and the vector OI is (h, k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero:

x*h + y*k = 0.

But I don't know where point O is yet. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry with another setup. For instance, place point I at (0, 0) and point O somewhere else. Since OI has length sqrt(13), and OI is perpendicular to IA, maybe I can
