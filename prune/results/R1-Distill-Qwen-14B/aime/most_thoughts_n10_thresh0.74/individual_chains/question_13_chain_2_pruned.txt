Okay, let me try to solve this problem. Hmm, so Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two scenarios with different walking speeds and times, and I need to find the time when she walks at a different speed. 

First, let me parse the information given. 

In the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, and the walk takes her 4 hours. But that 4 hours includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Wait, so the total time is 4 hours, which is the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop. 

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 kilometers per hour, and the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So the total time here is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, but let me convert that to minutes for easier calculations later. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes. So 144 minutes is the total time, including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the problem says the walk takes her 4 hours and 2 hours 24 minutes, but including t minutes in the coffee shop. So that total time includes the coffee shop time. So, the time she spends walking is less than those total times by t minutes. 

So, let me denote the walking time as T1 for the first scenario and T2 for the second scenario. 

In the first case, her walking speed is s km/h, and the total time (walking + coffee) is 4 hours. So, the walking time T1 = 4 hours minus t minutes. But since her walking distance is 9 km, the walking time can also be calculated as distance divided by speed. So, T1 = 9 / s hours. 

Similarly, in the second scenario, her speed is s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. So the walking time T2 = 2.4 hours minus t minutes. But again, the walking time can be calculated as 9 / (s + 2) hours. 

Wait, but t is in minutes, so maybe it's better to convert everything into minutes to keep the units consistent. Let me try that approach. 

In the first scenario, total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. The time she spends walking is (240 - t) minutes. Since speed is s km/h, the walking time in hours is 9 / s hours, which is equal to (240 - t)/60 hours. 

Similarly, in the second scenario, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes. The walking time is (144 - t) minutes, which
