Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n is a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. 

So, my goal is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me think about the structure of a two-digit number in base b. A two-digit number in base b can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1, and both a and c must be less than b (since in base b, digits go from 0 to b-1).

So, n = a * b + c, where 1 ≤ a < b, and 0 ≤ c < b.

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Let's square both sides to get rid of the square root:

(a + c)^2 = n.

But since n is also equal to a*b + c, we can set these equal to each other:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me rearrange this equation to see if I can find a relationship between a, b, and c.

Expanding the left side: a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c.

Bring all terms to one side: a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Let me rearrange terms:

a^2 - a*b + 2ac + c^2 - c = 0.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of a and c.

Alternatively, maybe I can express b in terms of a and c.

From the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

So,

b = (a + c)^2 - c / a.

Wait, let's solve for b:

b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a

Simplify numerator:

(a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

Break it down:

= (a^2)/a + (2ac)/a + (c^2 - c)/a

= a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

Hmm, since b must be an integer (base is an integer), the entire expression must be integer. Therefore, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

So, (c^2 - c) must be a multiple of a.

Alternatively, a divides (c^2 - c). Let me note that:

a | (c^2 - c)

Which means that c(c - 1) is divisible by a.

Given that a and c are digits in base b, where a is at least 1 and less than b, and c is between 0 and b-1.

Now, my variables are a and c, which must satisfy 1 ≤ a < b and 0 ≤ c < b.

But since I'm trying to find the base b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, perhaps I can think of each pair (a, c) as defining a possible n, and then for each b, count how many such pairs exist.

So, for a given b, I can iterate over possible a and c values, check whether (a + c)^2 = a*b + c, and count the number of such (a, c) pairs.

But since I'm looking for the minimal b where this count exceeds ten, maybe it's better to find an expression or a way to compute the number of solutions without having to iterate for each b.

Let me try to express the equation again:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange for b:

b = (a + c)^2 - c / a

But since b must be an integer, (a + c)^2 - c must be divisible by a.

So, (a + c)^2 ≡ c mod a.

Let me compute (a + c)^2 mod a:

(a + c)^2 mod a = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2) mod a.

Since a is a factor of a^2 and 2ac, those terms mod a are zero. So, it's equal to c^2 mod a.

Therefore:

c^2 ≡ c mod a.

Which simplifies to:

c^2 - c ≡ 0 mod a.

So, a divides c(c - 1).

Which is what I had earlier.

So, for each a, c must satisfy that a divides c(c-1).

Given that, perhaps for each a, I can find the possible c's such that c(c - 1) is divisible by a.

But since a and c are both less than b, which is the base, and a is at least 1, perhaps for each a, the possible c's are those where c ≡ 0 or 1 mod a.
