Okay, so I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c equals 300 and another equation involving their squares and products equals 6,000,000. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, the problem states:
a + b + c = 300
and
a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric equations, it's helpful to factor or find symmetries. Let me look at the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Wait, perhaps I can factor it as a common term. Let me see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that's better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), right? Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the equation:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that out:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this differently. Let's factor out the 300:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:
(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Wait, that doesn't seem as helpful. Maybe instead, let me think about the variables in terms of their sum and products.

I also know that a + b + c = 300. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

I also know that:
ab + bc + ca = let's call this P,
and abc = let's call this Q.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider symmetric functions or look for a way to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, P, and Q.

Wait, yes! There's a formula for a³ + b³ + c³:
a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S P + 3Q.

But in our equation earlier, we had:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute a² + b² + c². I know that:
a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S² - 2P.

So substituting into the equation:
300(S² - 2P) - (S³ - 3S P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.

We know that S = 300, so let's substitute S into the equation.

So, 300(300² - 2P) - (300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(300² - 2P):
300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600P.

Next, compute (300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q):
300³ is 27,000,000. Then, 3*300*P is 900P, and 3Q remains as is. So the whole term is 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.

Putting it all together into the equation:
[27,000,000 - 600P] - [27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Let's subtract the terms:
27,000,000 - 600P -27,000,000 + 900P -3Q = 6,000,000.

Simplify:
(27,000,000 -27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) + (-3Q) = 6,000,000.

Which simplifies to:
0 + 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:
100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so we have the equation 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

But P is ab + bc + ca, and Q is abc. So, Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Now, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P and Q will also be nonnegative integers. So, we need Q = 100P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0.

Which implies 100P ≥ 2,000,000, so P ≥ 20,000.

So, P is at least 20,000.

Now, I need to find triples (a, b, c) such that:

1. a + b + c = 300.

2. ab + bc + ca = P.

3. abc = Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, given these, I can consider the monic cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c:

x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0.

Which, substituting S, P, Q, becomes:

x³ - 300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify the equation:

x³ - 300x² + Px -100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this. Let me group terms:

(x³ - 300x²) + (Px - 100P) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor x² from the first two terms and P from the next two:

x²(x - 300) + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another approach?

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as:

x³ - 300x² + Px -100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Let me factor out terms with P:

x³ -300x² + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

So, P(x - 100) = -x³ + 300x² - 2,000,000.

Thus, P = [ -x³ + 300x² - 2,000,000 ] / (x - 100).

Hmm, I can perform polynomial division here to simplify the numerator.

Let me perform the division of numerator by (x - 100).

The numerator is: -x³ + 300x² - 2,000,000.

Let me write it as (-x³ + 300x² + 0x - 2,000,000) divided by (x - 100).

Using polynomial long division:

Divide -x³ by x: -x². Multiply (x - 100) by -x²: -x³ + 100x².

Subtract this from the numerator:

(-x³ + 300x²) - (-x³ + 100x²) = 200x².

Bring down the next term: 0x.

So now, we have 200x² + 0x.

Divide 200x² by x: 200x. Multiply (x - 100) by 200x: 200x² - 20,000x.

Subtract this from the current dividend:

(200x² + 0x) - (200x² - 20,000x) = 20,000x.

Bring down the next term: -2,000,000.

So now, we have 20,000x - 2,000,000.

Divide 20,000x by x: 20,000. Multiply (x - 100) by 20,000: 20,000x - 2,000,000.

Subtract this from the dividend:

(20,000x - 2,000,000) - (20,000x - 2,000,000) = 0.

So, the division is exact, and the quotient is -x² + 200x + 20,000.

So, P = (-x² + 200x + 20,000).

But wait, P is ab + bc + ca, which is symmetric in a, b, c, so perhaps each of a, b, c is a root of the equation.

Wait, actually, the equation came from treating x as a variable, but the roots are a, b, c. So maybe substituting x as each of a, b, c into the equation.

Wait, alternatively, since P is the same for all, maybe each of a, b, c satisfies the equation:

P = (-a² + 200a + 20,000).

Similarly for b and c.

Wait, but this seems a bit confusing. Let me think differently.

Since the polynomial is x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0, and we have roots a, b, c, then each of a, b, c must satisfy this equation.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can consider that at least one of the variables is 100.

Wait, why 100? Because when we had P = (expression) / (x - 100), so x = 100 is a root? Or perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, no, in the division, we have P = [ -x³ + 300x² - 2,000,000 ] / (x - 100) = (-x² + 200x + 20,000).

So, perhaps when x ≠ 100, P is equal to that. But since a, b, c are roots, perhaps substituting x = a, x = b, x = c, which are not necessarily 100.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't leading me anywhere. Let me think of another way.

We have Q = abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

And P = ab + bc + ca.

We also know that a + b + c = 300.

So, we have a system of equations:

1. a + b + c = 300.

2. ab + bc + ca = P.

3. abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Is there a way to find a, b, c that satisfy these?

Alternatively, perhaps consider that a, b, c are integers, and try to find possible triples where these equations hold. But 300 is a large number, so brute-force isn't feasible.

Wait, perhaps assuming two variables are equal or something?

Alternatively, let me see if I can find a relationship between a, b, c.

From the equation Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

We can write Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange this:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca = -2,000,000.

Factor:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b) = -2,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, a + b = 300 - c.

Substituting:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, let me write this as:

ab(c - 100) = 100c(300 - c) - 2,000,000.

Simplify the right side:

100c*300 - 100c² - 2,000,000 = 30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000.

So, equation becomes:

ab(c - 100) = 30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000.

Let me factor the right side:

30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000 = -100c² + 30,000c - 2,000,000.

Factor out -100:

-100(c² - 300c + 20,000).

Wait, let me compute c² - 300c + 20,000. Hmm, perhaps factor this quadratic.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 20,000 and add up to 300. Wait, 200 and 100: 200 * 100 = 20,000, and 200 + 100 = 300. So, c² - 300c + 20,000 = (c - 200)(c - 100).

So, the right side becomes:

-100(c - 200)(c - 100).

Therefore, the equation is:

ab(c - 100) = -100(c - 200)(c - 100).

Hmm, interesting. Let me write this as:

ab(c - 100) + 100(c - 200)(c - 100) = 0.

Factor out (c - 100):

(c - 100)(ab + 100(c - 200)) = 0.

So, either (c - 100) = 0 or (ab + 100(c - 200)) = 0.

Case 1: c = 100.

Case 2: ab + 100(c - 200) = 0.

Let me consider each case.

Case 1: c = 100.

Then, since a + b + c = 300, a + b = 200.

Also, we can compute P = ab + bc + ca.

With c = 100, P = ab + 100b + 100a.

But since a + b = 200, ab is part of the equation.

We also have Q = abc = ab * 100.

So, Q = 100ab.

But from earlier, Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, 100ab = 100P - 2,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

ab = P - 20,000.

But P = ab + 100a + 100b.

So, substituting:

ab = (ab + 100a + 100b) - 20,000.

Subtract ab from both sides:

0 = 100a + 100b - 20,000.

So, 100a + 100b = 20,000 => a + b = 200.

Which is consistent with a + b = 200 because c = 100.

But this doesn't give us new information. So, in this case, any a, b such that a + b = 200 will satisfy the equation.

But wait, from the original problem, we have a, b, c nonnegative integers. So, a and b can be any nonnegative integers adding up to 200.

The number of such triples would be the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b = 200, which is 201 (since a can be from 0 to 200, and b = 200 - a).

But wait, hold on. Because when c = 100, and a + b = 200, but we also have to check if the second equation is satisfied.

Wait, but in this case, we've derived that when c = 100, the equation reduces to a + b = 200, which is already given. So, all such triples (a, b, 100) where a + b = 200 will satisfy both equations.

So, in case 1, the number of triples is 201.

Case 2: ab + 100(c - 200) = 0.

So, ab + 100(c - 200) = 0.

Which implies ab = -100(c - 200) = 100(200 - c).

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, ab must be nonnegative. So, 100(200 - c) must be nonnegative. Therefore, 200 - c ≥ 0 => c ≤ 200.

So, c can be from 0 to 200.

But also, a and b are nonnegative integers, so ab is nonnegative. So, 100(200 - c) must be nonnegative, which is already satisfied.

So, ab = 100(200 - c).

But a + b + c = 300. So, a + b = 300 - c.

We can think of a and b as variables such that:

a + b = 300 - c,

and

ab = 100(200 - c).

So, for each c from 0 to 200, we can find the number of integer pairs (a, b) such that a + b = 300 - c and ab = 100(200 - c).

This seems manageable.

Let me denote d = 300 - c. Since c can be from 0 to 200,
