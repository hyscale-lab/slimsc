Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize and understand the problem first.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm, that means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Interesting, so there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved here.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Let me sketch this out mentally. ABCD is a rectangle, so AB and BC are adjacent sides. AB is 107, so AB is the length, and BC is 16, so the height. Then, EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Wait, so D and C are corners of their respective rectangles, and E and F are corners of the other. So the line passes through D, E, C, F.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me think about the properties here.

First, since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is 107 and BC is 16. So, sides AD and BC are 16, and sides AB and CD are 107. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, since EF is 184 and FG is 17, so EF is 184 and FG is 17. So sides EF and GH are 184, and FG and EH are 17.

Now, since D, E, C, F are collinear, perhaps line DEF is a straight line. So E is between D and C, and F is after C? Or maybe E is before D? Wait, no, because the order is D, E, C, F. So D is first, then E, then C, then F on the same line.

So the line goes D-E-C-F.

Now, given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me try to figure out where these points are.

Point A is a corner of rectangle ABCD; since ABCD is a rectangle, A is connected to B and D. Similarly, H is a corner of rectangle EFGH. So which corners? Let me think: in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, for EFGH, since EF is 184 and FG is 17, H would be opposite to G, perhaps?

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to these points. Coordinates might help me visualize and compute distances.

Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, AB is 107, then the coordinates can be set as follows:

- D is at (0, 0)
- C is at (107, 0) because DC is equal to AB, which is 107.
- B is at (107, 16)
- A is at (0, 16)

Wait, but if I place D at (0,0), then C is at (107,0). Then, since E, F are on the same line as D and C, and E is between D and C, but wait, the order is D, E, C, F. So E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Wait, but E is a corner of rectangle EFGH. So if E is on the line DC, then perhaps EFGH is positioned such that E is on DC, and F is on the extension beyond C.

Hmm, but rectangle EFGH must have sides EF and FG. If EF is 184 and FG is 17, then EFGH is another rectangle attached or connected somehow.

Wait, but E is on DC, which is the base of rectangle ABCD. So E
