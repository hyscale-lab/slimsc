Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's a root and it's not equal to 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any positive integer k less than 13. This is important because the powers of ω cycle every 13 steps.

The expression I need to compute is the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out to see if I can find a pattern or a way to simplify it.

Wait, when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so the term is (2 - 2*1 + 1) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So the first term is 1. That might be useful later.

For other values of k, like k=1 to 12, each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression somehow or relate it to some known polynomial.

Let me think about the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can write it in terms of ω^{k}. Let me set z = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z². So that's a quadratic in z: z² - 2z + 2.

Wait, so each term is z² - 2z + 2, where z = ω^k. So the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (z² - 2z + 2) evaluated at z = ω^k.

But since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Wait, maybe I can think of the product as the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z² - 2z + 2). Since when k goes from 0 to 12, z goes through all the 13th roots of unity. So the product would be the product over all z where z¹³ = 1 of (z² - 2z + 2). 

But the product over all roots of unity of a polynomial can sometimes be related to evaluating the polynomial at certain points or using properties of cyclotomic polynomials. Let me recall that if P(x) is a polynomial, then the product of P(z) for all z being the roots of a certain polynomial can be expressed as another polynomial evaluated at those roots.

Wait, specifically, if I have a polynomial f(x), then the product of f(z) over all roots z of another polynomial g(x) is equal to the resultant of f and g, or something like that? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, if f(x) is a polynomial, then ∏_{z: z^n=1} f(z) = something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for z being each 13th root of unity. So that would be the same as plugging each root into the polynomial P(z) = z² - 2z + 2 and multiplying them all together.

But in that case, the product over all roots of unity of P(z)
