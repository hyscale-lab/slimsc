Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have a regular octagon, and each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. Then, we have to express this probability as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n.

Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue. Each color is equally likely, so each vertex has a 50% chance of being red or blue. The colorings are independent, meaning the color of one vertex doesn't affect the others.

Now, the key part is that we can rotate the octagon such that all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, for example, if after some rotation, every blue vertex in the new position was red before the rotation, then this condition is satisfied.

So, I think what this means is that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you can rotate the blue set to match the red set, then all blue vertices would have been red in the original configuration.

Wait, but each vertex is colored red or blue independently. So the original coloring is a certain pattern, and after rotation, the blue points must exactly align with the red points of the original.

Alternatively, perhaps the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

But another way to think about it: if we can rotate the octagon so that all the blue vertices move to where red vertices were, that implies that the set of blue vertices is a cyclic shift of the red set.

But how do we model this? Let's think in terms of binary strings. Since each vertex can be red or blue, we can represent the coloring as a binary string of length 8, where 0 is red and 1 is blue, for example. Then, the problem reduces to finding the number of binary strings that are cyclic shifts of their complement.

Wait, but not exactly. Because the complement of a binary string would flip each bit, so if we have a binary string S, its complement is S' where each bit is flipped. So, if the set of blue vertices (1s) is a cyclic shift of the set of red vertices (0s
