Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the supremum of BD², the square of one of the diagonals, and then give the greatest number less than that.

First, let me recall that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, hold on, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. No, actually, no, I think I'm confusing with a kite. Wait, let me correct this.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at their midpoints, and the diagon
