Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about finding the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the octagon is regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal. So, it's symmetric, which is probably key here since we're dealing with rotations.

Each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability, so for each vertex, the color is like a binary choice—red or blue. Since the colorings are independent, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. So, the sample space has 256 outcomes, each equally likely.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon that maps all blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. Let me think about what that means.

Suppose I have a particular coloring. I can rotate the octagon by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which are the possible rotational symmetries for an octagon. For each rotation, I need to check if after applying that rotation, every blue vertex in the original coloring moves to a position that was red before the rotation.

Wait, actually, no—that's not quite right. Let me clarify: the rotation is applied to the entire octagon, so the positions are rotated, and the colors move with them. So, if I rotate the octagon, the colors of the vertices move to new positions. The problem is saying that after such a rotation, all the blue vertices (which moved) are now at positions that were originally red. So, in other words, the image of the blue vertices under the rotation must be a subset of the originally red vertices.

Wait, no, more precisely: after rotation, every blue vertex is now at a position that was previously red. So, if I have a blue vertex at position i, after rotation by k positions, it's now at position (i + k) mod 8. So, for this rotated blue vertex to be where a red vertex was originally, the color at position (i + k) mod 8 must have been red in the original coloring.

So, for a given rotation k, the condition is that for every vertex i that is blue in the original coloring, the vertex (i + k) mod 8 was red in the original coloring.

Therefore, if we denote the original coloring as a function c: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} → {red, blue}, then for a rotation by k positions, the condition is that for all i, if c(i) = blue, then c((i + k) mod 8) = red.

Wait, but hold on, if we rotate the octagon by k positions, then the color at position i is moved to position (i + k) mod 8. So, for
