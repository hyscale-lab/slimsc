Okay, so I'm looking at this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. The question is about finding the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces, where all these distances are equal. They mention that this distance can be written in a specific form, and I need to find the sum m + n + p where the distance is expressed as (m√n)/p with the conditions on m, n, p.

Hmm, let me recall. In a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I remember that for any polyhedron, the formula is 3 times the volume divided by the surface area. Wait, no, actually, for a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. Let me make sure: yes, because the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*base area*height, and for the inradius, each face is a base, so when you sum them up, you get V = (1/3)*(A1 + A2 + A3 + A4)*r, so r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4).

So, the plan is to find the volume V of this tetrahedron and the total surface area A, then compute r = 3V / A.

But first, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when all the edge lengths are given? I think I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which gives the volume based on the edge lengths. The formula is:

V = √[ CM / 288 ], where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

CM = | 0 1 1 1 1 |
     | 1 0 a² b² c² |
     | 1 a² 0 d² e² |
     | 1 b² d² 0 f² |
     | 1 c² e² f² 0 |

So, arranging the edges, let me assign the edges:

Given AB = √41, CD = √41, so AB² = 41, CD² = 41.

AC = √80, BD = √80, so AC² = 80, BD² = 80.

BC = √89, AD = √89, so BC² = 89, AD² = 89.

Wait, let me make sure I assign which edge is which.

In the Cayley-Menger determinant, the points are A, B, C, D. So, the edges are AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.

Given that AB and CD are both √41. So AB² = 41, CD² =41.

Similarly, AC and BD are √80, so AC² =80, BD²=80.

BC and AD are √89, so BC²=89, AD²=89.

So, let's write down the determinant:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² → 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² → 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD² → 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0 → 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the positions.

Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix:

The first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Then for the other rows:

Row i corresponds to point (i-1), and the entries are the squared distances to the other points.

So, point A: distances AB, AC, AD, and the determinant includes the squared distances.

Wait, maybe I should lay it out properly.

Let me define the points as A, B, C, D. The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:

CM = determinant of the matrix:

0   1    1    1    1

1   0  AB² AC² AD²

1 AB² 0  BC² BD²

1 AC² BC² 0  CD²

1 AD² BD² CD² 0

So, substituting the known squared distances:

AB² = 41, AC² =80, AD²=89,

BC²=89, BD²=80, CD²=41.

So, the matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix, which seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry here that can simplify the calculation.

Looking at the matrix, it seems symmetric. Rows 1 and 2 have 41 and 80 in certain positions, and rows 3 and 4 have 80 and 41. Maybe there's some symmetry or way to simplify the determinant.

But computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is going to be tedious. Maybe I can use expansion by minors or look for patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, but I'm not sure. Maybe not, since the edges are all different lengths but paired.

Alternatively, perhaps the volume can be found another way. Maybe by considering the tetrahedron as two congruent triangles or something.

Wait, but perhaps since all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron is called "equifacial" or "isohedral," but I need to check.

Wait, no, equifacial means all faces are congruent, which is a stronger condition. Here, the edges are equal in pairs, so
