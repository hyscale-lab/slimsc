Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be in the form of r squared, which is p/q, and then I have to find p + q.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what a rectangular box is. It's basically a box with length, width, and height, which I'll denote as x, y, z. The surface area (SA) of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume (V) is xyz. So, according to the problem, 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Our goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The radius of this sphere would be half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box is calculated using the formula d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r would be d/2, so r² would be (d²)/4. Hence, to find r², I need to find the minimum of (x² + y² + z²)/4, given the constraints on SA and V.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z², given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23. Once I find the minimum value of x² + y² + z², I can divide it by 4 to get r².

This looks like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but I might need to set up the equations carefully.

Let me write down the constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 → xy + yz + zx = 27
2. xyz = 23

And the function to minimize is f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

So, I have two constraints, so I might need two Lagrange multipliers. Alternatively, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using the volume constraint and substitute into the surface area constraint, then express the function to minimize in terms of two variables. That might be a more straightforward approach.

Let me try that. Let me solve the volume equation for z: z = 23/(xy). Then substitute this into the surface area equation.

So, the surface area equation becomes: xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27.

Simplify that:

xy + (23/y) + (23/x) = 27.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe it's better to use symmetry here. I remember that for optimization problems with symmetric functions, sometimes assuming variables are equal gives extrema, but in this case, the volume and surface area might not allow x, y, z to be equal. Let me check.

If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x = 3. Then volume would be 3³ = 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, x, y, z cannot all be equal. So, they must be unequal. Therefore, I can't assume symmetry here.

Hmm, maybe I should use Lagrange multipliers after all. Let's set up the Lagrangian. We need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z² subject to constraints g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx - 27 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

The Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, we take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly, ∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx = 27

xyz = 23

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)  
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)  
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)  
4. xy + yz + zx = 27  
5. xyz = 23

Hmm, this system looks complicated, but maybe I can find some relationships between x, y, z.

Let me try subtracting equations 1 and 2 to eliminate μ.

Equation 1 - Equation 2:

2x - 2y = λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz)

Simplify:

2(x - y) = λ(y - x) + μ z (y - x)

Factor out (y - x):

2(x - y) = -(λ + μ z)(x - y)

If x ≠ y, then we can divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = -(λ + μ z)

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 and 3:

2x - 2z = λ(y + z - x - y) + μ(yz - xy)

Simplify:

2(x - z) = λ(z - x) + μ y (z - x)

Factor out (z - x):

2(x - z) = -(λ + μ y)(x - z)

If x ≠ z, then:

2 = -(λ + μ y)

So we have two equations:

2 = -(λ + μ z)  
2 = -(λ + μ y)

Subtracting these two gives:

0 = -μ(z - y) → μ(z - y) = 0.

So either μ = 0 or z = y.

If μ = 0, then from the earlier equation, 2 = -λ. So λ = -2. Let's see if this holds.

From equation 1: 2x = λ(y + z) + μ yz = (-2)(y + z) + 0 → 2x = -2(y + z) → x = -(y + z).

But x, y, z are lengths, so they must be positive. x can't be negative, so μ cannot be zero. Therefore, the other possibility is z = y.

So, z = y. Similarly, if we subtract equation 2 and 3, we might find that x = z or something else. Wait, let's check.

Wait, if z = y, then from the earlier equations, 2 = -(λ + μ z) and 2 = -(λ + μ y) which are the same because z = y.

So, let's proceed with z = y.

So, let me set z = y. Then, our variables are x, y, y.

Now, let's rewrite the constraints.

Constraint 4: xy + yz + zx = x y + y^2 + x y = 2 x y + y² = 27

Constraint 5: x y² = 23

So, from constraint 5: x = 23/(y²)

Substitute into constraint 4:

2*(23/(y²)) * y + y² = 27

Simplify:

2*(23/y) + y² = 27 → (46)/y + y² = 27

Multiply both sides by y to eliminate the denominator:

46 + y³ = 27 y → y³ -27 y +46 = 0

So, we have the equation y³ -27 y +46 = 0.

We need to solve this cubic equation for y. Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing y=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠ 0.

y=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 → 8-54 is -46 +46=0. Yes, y=2 is a root.

So, we can factor it as (y - 2)(y² + 2 y -23) =0.

So, the other roots are solutions of y² + 2 y -23=0.

Using quadratic formula: y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4 sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6).

Since y is a length, it must be positive. So, y= -1 + 2 sqrt(6) ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, the roots are y=2 and y ≈3.898.

So, possible y values are y=2 and y= -1 +2 sqrt(6). Let me compute y=2 first.

If y=2, then since z=y=2, and x=23/(y²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the dimensions would be x=23/4, y=2, z=2.

Now, check the surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx)=2*( (23/4)*2 + 2*2 + (23/4)*2 )=2*(23/2 +4 +23/2 )=2*( (23/2 +23/2) +4 )=2*(23 +4)=2*27=54. So, that's correct.

So, the surface area is correct.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z² for this case.

x=23/4, y=2, z=2.

So, x² = (23/4)^2 = 529/16.

y²=4, z²=4.

Total: 529/16 + 4 +4 = 529/16 + 8 = 529/16 + 128/16 = 657/16. So, x² + y² + z²=657/16. So, r² = (657/16)/4=657/64≈10.2656.

But wait, there's another root y= -1 +2 sqrt(6). Let's check that as well.

Compute y= -1 +2 sqrt(6). Let me compute y numerically: sqrt(6)=2.449, so 2*2.449≈4.898. So, y≈-1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, y≈3.898. Then, since z=y, z≈3.898 as well.

Then x would be 23/(y²). Let's compute y²: ( -1 +2 sqrt(6) )² = 1 -4 sqrt(6) + 24 =25 -4 sqrt(6). So, x=23/(25 -4 sqrt(6)).

To rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4 sqrt(6)):

x=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6)) / [ (25)^2 - (4 sqrt(6))^2 ] = [23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))]/[625 - 16*6] = [23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))]/[625 -96]= [23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))]/529.

Simplify: 23/529=1/23. So, x=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.

So, x=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23, y=z= -1 +2 sqrt(6).

Now, compute x² + y² + z².

Well, since y=z, this will be x² + 2 y².

Compute y²: (-1 +2 sqrt(6))² =1 -4 sqrt(6) +24=25 -4 sqrt(6).

x²: [(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23]^2 = (625 + 200 sqrt(6) + 16*6)/529 = (625 +200 sqrt(6) +96)/529=(721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

So, x² + 2 y² = (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529 + 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6)).

Compute 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6))=50 -8 sqrt(6).

Convert to over 529 denominator:

50 -8 sqrt(6) = (50*529 -8 sqrt(6)*529)/529. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, actually, 50 is 50/1, so to get denominator 529, it's 50*529/529 = (50*529)/529. Wait, but that's not the correct way. Alternatively, perhaps I should express 50 -8 sqrt(6) as (50*529 -8 sqrt(6)*529)/529, but that's not helpful. Maybe I should compute it differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think. Since y²=25 -4 sqrt(6), which is a number, and x² is another number. So, x² +2 y² is [721 +200 sqrt(6)]/529 + 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6)).

Wait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute x² + 2 y² as a number, but I'm getting into some complicated expressions.

Wait, maybe I should compute whether this case gives a smaller x² + y² + z² than the first case where y=2.

In the first case, x²+y²+z²=657/16≈41.0625.

In the second case, let's compute x² + 2 y².

x= (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23, so x²≈(25 +4*2.449)^2 / (23^2)≈(25+9.796)^2 / 529≈(34.796)^2 /529≈1210.6 /529≈2.288.

y≈3.898, so y²≈15.19.

Thus, x² + 2 y²≈2.288 + 2*15.19≈2.288 +30.38≈32.668.

Wait, that's way smaller than 41.06. So, this case must be the minimal one.

But wait, wait, how can that be? Because when y=2, the dimensions were x=23/4=5.75, y=2, z=2, which is a more stretched-out box, which intuitively would have a larger space diagonal than a more cube-like box.

So, the case where y≈3.898 is more cube-like and thus has a smaller space diagonal. So, this is the minimal case.

Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² is 32.668 approximately, but let's find the exact value.

Wait, but when I calculated x² +2 y² earlier, I had:

x² = (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529,

and 2 y² = 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6)) =50 -8 sqrt(6).

But 50 -8 sqrt(6) is a number, so
