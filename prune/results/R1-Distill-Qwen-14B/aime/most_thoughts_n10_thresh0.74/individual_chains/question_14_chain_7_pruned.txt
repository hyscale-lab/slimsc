Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking for. 

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when N is divided by 1000, Q is the quotient and R is the remainder. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7.

So, for example, if N is abcd, then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives ab11. Each of these numbers should be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies this condition.

But that might take a long time. Maybe I can think of a smarter way.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = WXYZ, where W, X, Y, Z are its digits, with W ranging from 1 to 9 and X, Y, Z from 0 to 9.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 should make the number divisible by 7. So let's write down each modified number and set their divisibility by 7 as a condition.

1. Changing W to 1: 1XYZ. So 1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing X to 1: W1YZ. So 1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing Y to 1: WX1Z. So 1000W + 100X + 10 + Z must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing Z to 1: WXY1. So 1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1 must be divisible by 7.

Each of these four numbers must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

So, mathematically, we have four congruence conditions:

1. 1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000W + 100X + 10 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Our goal is to find the largest N = WXYZ satisfying all four conditions.

Hmm, perhaps I can express each of these congruences in terms of N's digits and mod 7.

But maybe it's easier to compute each of these four numbers modulo 7 and set them equal to zero.

But let's recall that 1000 mod 7 can be calculated. Let's compute some mod 7 values for powers of 10:

10^0 mod7 = 1

10^1 mod7 = 3 (since 10 - 7 = 3)

10^2 mod7 = 3*3=9 mod7=2

10^3 mod7=2*3=6

So, 10^k mod7 cycles as 1,3,2,6,4,5,1,... for k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...

So, 10^3 mod7=6, which is for the thousands place.

So, for a four-digit number WXYZ, each digit's place mod7 is:

- W contributes W*6 mod7
- X contributes X*2 mod7
- Y contributes Y*3 mod7
- Z contributes Z*1 mod7

So, the entire number N mod7 is (6W + 2X + 3Y + Z) mod7.

Similarly, for each modified number:

1. 1XYZ: 1 is in thousands place, so 1*6 + X*2 + Y*3 + Z*1 ≡ 0 mod7
   So, 6 + 2X + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod7

2. W1YZ: W*6 + 1*2 + Y*3 + Z*1 ≡ 0 mod7
   So, 6W + 2 + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod7

3. WX1Z: W*6 + X*2 + 1*3 + Z*1 ≡ 0 mod7
   So, 6W + 2X + 3 + Z ≡ 0 mod7

4. WXY1: W*6 + X*2 + Y*3 + 1*1 ≡ 0 mod7
   So, 6W + 2X + 3Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

So now, we have four equations:

1. 6 + 2X + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (1)
2. 6W + 2 + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (2)
3. 6W + 2X + 3 + Z ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (3)
4. 6W + 2X + 3Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (4)

Our goal is to find W, X, Y, Z digits (W from 1-9, others 0-9) such that all four equations are satisfied, and N is the largest possible.

Since we want the largest N, we should start with W=9, then X=9, Y=9, Z=9 and see if it satisfies all four equations. If not, decrement Z, then Y, etc., until we find the largest N that works.

But that might be time-consuming, so perhaps we can find relationships between the equations to reduce variables.

Let me see if I can subtract some equations to find relations between variables.

Let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6W + 2 + 3Y + Z) - (6 + 2X + 3Y + Z) ≡ 0 mod7
6W + 2 -6 -2X ≡ 0 mod7
6W -2X -4 ≡ 0 mod7

Let me write that as:

6W - 2X ≡ 4 mod7 --> Let's call this Equation (5)

Similarly, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(6W + 2 + 3Y + Z) - (6W + 2X + 3 + Z) ≡ 0 mod7
2 + 3Y - 2X -3 ≡ 0 mod7
-2X + 3Y -1 ≡ 0 mod7

So,

-2X + 3Y ≡ 1 mod7 --> Equation (6)

Similarly, subtract Equation (4) from Equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (4):

(6W + 2X + 3 + Z) - (6W + 2X + 3Y + 1) ≡ 0 mod7
3 + Z - 3Y -1 ≡ 0 mod7
Z - 3Y +2 ≡ 0 mod7

So,

Z ≡ 3Y -2 mod7 --> Equation (7)

Similarly, subtract Equation (4) from Equation (1):

Equation (1) - Equation (4):

(6 + 2X + 3Y + Z) - (6W + 2X + 3Y +1 ) ≡ 0 mod7
6 + Z -6W -1 ≡ 0 mod7
Z -6W +5 ≡ 0 mod7

So,

Z ≡ 6W -5 mod7 --> Equation (8)

From Equations (7) and (8), we have:

3Y -2 ≡ Z ≡ 6W -5 mod7

Therefore,

3Y -2 ≡ 6W -5 mod7

Simplify:

3Y ≡ 6W -3 mod7

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):

Y ≡ 2W -1 mod7 --> Equation (9)

So Y is congruent to 2W -1 mod7.

Since Y is a digit (0-9), and W is 1-9, we can write Y as Y = (2W -1) mod7, but adjusted to be a valid digit.

Also, from Equation (7): Z = 3Y -2 mod7

But Z is a digit (0-9), so Z can be found once Y is known.

Now, let's look at Equation (5):

6W -2X ≡4 mod7

We can write 6W -2X ≡4 mod7.

Let me solve for X in terms of W.

6W -2X ≡4 mod7
=> -2X ≡ 4 -6W mod7
Multiply both sides by -1:
2X ≡6W -4 mod7
Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime):
X ≡ 3W -2 mod7

So, X = (3W -2) mod7. So X can be written as X = 3W -2 +7k, for some integer k, such that X is between 0 and 9.

But since X is a digit, X must be between 0 and 9. So, for each W, X is determined modulo7.

Similarly, from Equation (6):

-2X + 3Y ≡1 mod7

But from Equation (9), Y ≡2W -1 mod7.

So substituting Y into Equation (6):

-2X +3*(2W -1) ≡1 mod7
-2X +6W -3 ≡1 mod7
-2X +6W ≡4 mod7

But from Equation (5), we have 6W -2X ≡4 mod7. So this is consistent.

So, that means that Equations (5) and (6) are not independent; they are the same equation.

Therefore, we have:

1. Y ≡2W -1 mod7
2. X ≡3W -2 mod7
3. Z ≡3Y -2 mod7
4. From Equation (4): 6W +2X +3Y +1 ≡0 mod7

So, perhaps using these relations, I can express all variables in terms of W, and then find constraints.

Since W is a digit from 1 to9, perhaps I can iterate W from9 down to 1, compute X, Y, Z accordingly, and check if all digits are valid (0-9), and also check if N = WXYZ satisfies the original conditions.

But wait, even if X, Y, Z are computed as per mod7, they might not satisfy the original conditions directly because the number N itself might not satisfy the equations when considering the actual digits, not just their mod7 relations.

Wait, perhaps not. Because the conditions were built from the mod7 congruences, so if all equations are satisfied mod7, then the numbers should be divisible by7.

But let me think. For example, when we change a digit, say, W to 1, the resulting number 1XYZ must be 0 mod7. So 1000 + 100X +10Y + Z must be 0 mod7, which is exactly what Equation (1) captures.

Similarly, the other equations capture the other modified numbers.

So, if all four equations (1)-(4) are satisfied, then N is the number we need.

So, if I can find W, X, Y, Z such that all four equations are satisfied, then N is the number we seek.

So, let's proceed.

Our variables:

W: 1-9

X: (3W -2) mod7, but X must be 0-9.

Similarly, Y: (2W -1) mod7, but Y must be 0-9.

Z: (3Y -2) mod7, but Z must be 0-9.

But since mod7, some of these might not directly give a digit, but adding multiples of7 until it's in the 0-9 range.

Wait, but actually, since 3W -2 can be negative or greater than 9. So let's adjust for that.

Let me think of how to compute X, Y, Z in terms of W.

Given W, X is (3W -2) mod7. But to get X between 0-9, I can compute X as the smallest non-negative residue mod7, then if necessary, add 7 to get into 0-9.

But since 3W -2 can be up to 3*9 -2 =25, so mod7, 25 mod7 is 4, so X can be 4, 11, 18, etc. But X is a digit, so X can be 4
