Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about finding the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, we need to compute P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since if A happens, B must happen (because if she wins the grand prize, she definitely won a prize), P(A and B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to find the probability of winning the grand prize divided by the probability of winning a prize. Let me break this down.

First, let's figure out the total number of ways the lottery can be drawn. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). C(n,k) is the combination formula, n choose k.

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, 210 possible combinations.

Now, the probability of winning the grand prize, P(A), is the probability that Jen's 4 numbers are exactly the ones chosen. Since there is only one such winning combination, P(A) is 1 / 210.

Next, let's find the probability of winning a prize, P(B). Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, this includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen. We can calculate this by summing the probabilities of these three cases.

Alternatively, it's sometimes easier to compute the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1. The complementary event of winning a prize is that she wins nothing, meaning fewer than two of her numbers are chosen. So, that would be the cases where zero or one of her numbers are among the four chosen.

So, maybe it's easier to compute 1 - P(no prize) = P(B). Let's try that approach.

First, let's compute the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. We already said it's 210.

Now, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with zero of Jen's numbers is: Jen has 4 specific numbers, so the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). Let me compute that: 6! / (4! * 2!) = (6*5)/2 = 15.

Similarly, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly one of Jen's numbers is: C(4,1) * C(6,3). Because we choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6. Let's compute that: 4 * (6! / (3! * 3!)) = 4 * (20) = 80. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Wait, 6 choose 3 is (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20, correct. So, 4 * 20 = 80, yes.

So, the number of ways that Jen doesn't win a prize is 15 (zero numbers) + 80 (one number) = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways she wins a prize is total combinations minus non-winning combinations: 210 - 95 = 115. So, P(B) is 115 / 210.

Alternatively, since we know P(B) = 1 - [P(zero) + P(one)], but we have the counts, so it's 115/210.

Now, going back, P(A) is 1/210, since only
