Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me try to visualize it. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, the opposite edges are equal. So, AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. All these edges are given specific lengths: sqrt(41), sqrt(80), and sqrt(89) respectively.

The problem mentions a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I remember that in a tetrahedron, there's something called an incenter, which is the point equidistant from all faces, kind of like the incenter of a triangle. So, point I must be the incenter of this tetrahedron.

The goal is to find this distance, which can be written in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I need to find the sum m + n + p.

Alright, how do I approach this? I think the distance from the incenter to each face is related to the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of its faces. In a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to a face) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces). 

So, first, I need to find the volume V of this tetrahedron, and then calculate the areas of each face to get the total surface area S. Once I have those, I can compute r.

But wait, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I only know the lengths of its edges? I recall that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths given, we might need to use a formula that can compute the volume based on the edge lengths. But I don't remember the exact formula. Maybe I need to use coordinates?

Yes, perhaps setting up coordinates for the tetrahedron and then using the scalar triple product to find the volume. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron, and it has some symmetry which might make it easier to assign coordinates.

Let me think about how to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system. Let's assign coordinates to the four vertices A, B, C, D such that the centroid is at the origin or something symmetric. But maybe a better approach is to place it such that calculations are easier.

Alternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps it's a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal and perpendicular? Wait, no, that's a different property. Hmm.

Wait, in an isosceles tetrahedron (where opposite edges are equal), the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) ) / 72

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use Heron's formula for each face and then find the volume.

Wait, actually, in a general tetrahedron, the volume can be found if we know the areas of the faces and some dihedral angles, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which allows computing the volume based on edge lengths.

Yes, the Cayley-Menger determinant is the way to go. I remember that formula. The formula for the volume V of a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

288 V^2 = | determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix |

The Cayley-Menger matrix is a 5x5 matrix constructed as follows:

[ 0    1     1     1     1  ]
[ 1    0    a^2   b^2   c^2 ]
[ 1   a^2   0     d^2   e^2 ]
[ 1   b^2  d^2    0     f^2 ]
[ 1   c^2  e^2   f^2    0  ]

So, I need to fill this matrix with the given edge lengths. Let me note down the given edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) → a = sqrt(41)
AC = sqrt(80) → b = sqrt(80)
AD = sqrt(89) → c = sqrt(89)
BC = sqrt(89) → d = sqrt(89)
BD = sqrt(80) → e = sqrt(80)
CD = sqrt(41) → f = sqrt(41)

Wait, let me confirm: AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), BC = AD = sqrt(89). So yes, a=AB=sqrt41, b=AC=sqrt80, c=AD=sqrt89, d=BC=sqrt89, e=BD=sqrt80, f=CD=sqrt41.

So, let's compute the squares:

a² = 41
b² = 80
c² = 89
d² = 89
e² = 80
f² = 41

Now, construct the Cayley-Menger
