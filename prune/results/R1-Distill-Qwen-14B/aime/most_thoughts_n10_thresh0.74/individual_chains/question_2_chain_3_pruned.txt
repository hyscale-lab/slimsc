Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to picture it in my mind first. We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis from O to (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis, a bit more than halfway from O to (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ has length 1, P is (p,0), and Q is (0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers. Since PQ is a unit length, by the Pythagorean theorem, p^2 + q^2 = 1^2 = 1. So, all these segments are from points on the x-axis and y-axis forming a right triangle with legs p and q, and hypotenuse 1.

So, the family F is all such segments PQ, each of length 1, in the first quadrant. I think this forms a kind of envelope or maybe a curve that these segments touch or something. But the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments, right?

Wait, let me check: AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute its length. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of length 1, so AB is in the family F.

So, F includes all such segments, including AB. Now, we need to find a point C on AB, not at A or B, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from F. That is, C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

I think this point C is the point where the envelope of all these segments PQ touches AB. Because if you imagine all these segments PQ, each of length 1, with P moving along the x-axis and Q moving along the y-axis, then these segments would form a kind of curve. The envelope of these segments would be the boundary that just touches each PQ. So, the point C is where this envelope intersects AB.

So, to find C, we need to find the envelope of the family F of segments PQ. Then, find where this envelope intersects AB, which would give us point C.

How do we find the envelope of a family of curves? I remember that for a family of curves defined by a parameter, say t, the envelope satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to t equals zero. But in this case, each PQ is a line segment, so we can parametrize each segment and then find the envelope.

Let me try to parametrize the segments PQ. For a given P at (p, 0) and Q at (0, q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1, the equation of the line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1. Because it's a straight line intercepting the x-axis at p and y-axis at q.

So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, we can represent the family of lines as F: x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method where we take F as F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/q - 1 = 0 and the constraint G(p, q) = p^2 + q^2 - 1 = 0. Then, we can use the method of solving for the envelope by considering F(p, x, y) and dG/dÎ» = 0, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method. Maybe I should recall that the envelope is found by solving F(p, x, y) = 0 and dF/dp = 0, treating p as a parameter.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since each PQ is a line x/p + y/q =1, and p^2 + q^2=1, perhaps we can eliminate p and q to find the envelope.

Let me see. We have two equations:

1. x/p + y/q = 1

2. p^2 + q^2 = 1

We can solve for one variable in terms of the other from equation 1 and substitute into equation 2.

From equation 1: Let's denote equation 1 as:

x/p + y/q = 1.

Let me express q in terms of p. From equation 1:

y/q = 1 - x/p

So, q = y / (1 - x/p)

Multiply both sides by (1 - x/p):

q(1 - x/p) = y

q - x q / p = y

Rearranging:

q = y + (x q)/p

Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe express p in terms of q:

From equation 1: x/p = 1 - y/q

So, p = x / (1 - y/q)

But that seems similar to before.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use substitution. Let me denote t = p. Then, since p^2 + q^2 = 1, q = sqrt(1 - t^2). But we have to be careful with the signs, but since p and q are positive in the first quadrant, we can write q = sqrt(1 - t^2).

Then, the equation of PQ is x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2) = 1.

So, the family of lines is F(t, x, y) = x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2) - 1 = 0.

To find the envelope, we can take the derivative of F with respect to t and set it equal to zero.

So, dF/dt = -x/t^2 + y * ( (1/2)(1 - t^2)^(-3/2) * (2t) ) = 0.

Simplify:

- x / t^2 + y * t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2) = 0

So, x / t^2 = y * t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2)

Multiply both sides by t^2 (1 - t^2)^(3/2):

x (1 - t^2)^(3/2) = y t^3

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe it's better to square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me think about parametrizing the envelope.

Wait, I remember that the envelope of such lines is a circle. Wait, but this would be an astroid or something else?

Wait, the envelope of all lines x/p + y/q = 1, where p^2 + q^2 =1, is known as the astroid. But let me confirm.

An astroid is a hypocycloid with four cusps, and it can be parametrized as x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1. Alternatively, the envelope of lines x/a + y/b =1 with a^2 + b^2 = c^2 is an astroid.

Wait, in our case, p^2 + q^2 =1, so the envelope should be an astroid. So, the equation of the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1. Let me verify.

Wait, if I think about the envelope, for each t, the line x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2) =1 is tangent to the astroid. So, perhaps the astroid is the envelope.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, the astroid is the curve that is tangent to all these lines PQ.

So, the point C is the point where AB intersects this astroid. Because C is on AB, which is one of the lines in F, and it's the unique point that's only on AB and the astroid.

Alternatively, since AB is one of the lines in F, and the astroid is the envelope, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.
