Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: 

Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm. So, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1, and then find the smallest m for that p such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

First, I think I should find the smallest prime p satisfying the condition. So, maybe I should check primes one by one and see if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Wait, but maybe I don't need to check all primes. I remember that for primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, this might hold. Let me think. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² implies that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. So, first, I need that -1 is a quartic residue mod p. 

What does that imply about p? I recall that for a prime p, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if the order of -1 in the multiplicative group divides (p-1)/2. Wait, that might not be exactly right. Let me think. 

In the multiplicative group modulo p, the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. Similarly, for x^k ≡ a mod p, a solution exists if a is a (k)-th power residue, which relates to the gcd(k, p-1). 

So, for x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, -1 must be a fourth power residue mod p. Let's see, -1 is a square, so it's a quadratic residue when p ≡ 1 mod 4. But being a quartic residue is a stronger condition.

I think that for x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, the multiplicative order of -1 modulo p must divide (p-1)/4, maybe? Wait, no, the multiplicative order of -1 is 2, so perhaps 2 divides the order of the multiplicative group divided by the gcd of 4 and the order. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of exponents.

Wait, another approach: Let me note that if x^4 ≡ -1 mod p, then squaring both sides gives x^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So, the order of x modulo p divides 8, but also the order must divide p-1. Therefore, 8 divides p-1, so p ≡ 1 mod 8. 

Wait, is that correct? Let me see: If x^4 ≡ -1 mod p, then x^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So, the order of x is 8, which implies that 8 divides p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

But wait, is that the only condition? Because maybe the order could be a factor of 8, like 4, but x^4 ≡ -1, which isn't 1, so the order can't be 4. So, the order must be 8, which implies 8 divides p-1. So, p must be ≡ 1 mod 8.

But wait, wait, let me test with some primes. Let's take p=17, which is 1 mod 8. Let me see if there exists an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod 17.

Let me compute the quartic residues mod 17. The multiplicative group is cyclic of order 16. The fourth powers would correspond to exponents that are multiples of 4 in the exponent. So, the possible quartic residues are the squares of quadratic residues. Wait, to compute n^4 mod 17, I can compute n^2 mod 17, then square that.

Let me list the quadratic residues mod 17: 1, 4, 9, 16, 5, 25=8, 36=2, etc. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute n^4 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 17 is symmetric).

n=1: 1^4=1.

n=2: 16.

n=3: 81 mod17: 81-4*17=81-68=13.

n=4: 256 mod17. 256 /17 is 15*17=255, so 256 ≡1.

n=5: 625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13.

n=6: 1296 mod17. 17*76=1292, so 1296-1292=4.

n=7: 7^2=49≡15, then 15^2=225≡4 (since 17*13=221, so 225-221=4). So, 7^4≡4.

n=8: 8^2=64≡13, 13^2=169≡16.

So, the quartic residues modulo 17 are 1,4,13,16. Wait, so does -1 mod 17 equal to 16? Because -1 mod17 is 16. So, 16 is a quartic residue mod17. So, n=8: 8^4 ≡16≡-1 mod17. So, yes, n=8 is a solution. So, for p=17, n=8, n^4 +1 ≡0 mod17.

But we need divisibility by p², which is 17²=289. So, we need to check if 8^4 +1 is divisible by 289.

Compute 8^4: 4096. 4096 +1=4097. Now, 4097 divided by 289: 289*14=4046, 4097-4046=51. So, 4097=289*14 +51. So, remainder 51, not zero. So, 8^4+1 is not divisible by 17². Hmm.

So, even though p=17 has n=8 such that 8^4 ≡-1 mod17, it's not the case that 8^4 ≡-1 mod17². So, perhaps p=17 is not the prime we're looking for.

Wait, so maybe I need to find primes p where not only does x^4 ≡-1 mod p have a solution, but also x^4 ≡-1 mod p² has a solution. So, lifting the solution from mod p to mod p².

I remember Hensel's lemma, which allows lifting solutions from mod p to mod p² under certain conditions. So, if f(x) = x⁴ +1, and we have f(n) ≡0 mod p, then to lift to mod p², we need that the derivative f'(n) ≡0 mod p? Wait, no, Hensel's lemma says that if f(n)≡0 mod p and f'(n) not≡0 mod p, then there is a unique lift mod p².

Wait, let me recall: For a simple root (i.e., f'(n) ≠0 mod p), there's a unique lift. If f'(n)≡0 mod p, then the solution may not lift or may have multiple lifts.

So, in our case, f(x) = x⁴ +1. f'(x)=4x³. So, if n is a solution mod p, then f'(n)=4n³. For the derivative to be 0 mod p, we need 4n³≡0 mod p. Since n is not 0 mod p (as f(n) =n⁴ +1≡0 mod p implies n≠0 mod p), so 4n³≡0 mod p implies p divides 4. So, p=2 is the only prime where the derivative could be 0 mod p.

So, for primes p≠2, the derivative f'(n)=4n³ is not 0 mod p, so Hensel's lemma applies, and the solution can be uniquely lifted from mod p to mod p².

Wait, so for primes p≠2, any solution mod p can be lifted to a solution mod p². Therefore, if p≡1 mod8, and n⁴≡-1 mod p, then there exists m such that m⁴≡-1 mod p². So, does that mean that for p=17, such an m exists? But earlier, when I tried n=8, m=8 didn't work for mod 289. But maybe there exists another m?

Wait, so perhaps n=8 is a solution mod17, but it's not a solution mod289, but maybe another
