Okay, so I have this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I know it's a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states that there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's a given for everyone. Then, there are some other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

Wait, so these are the numbers for each item. But some people might own more than one, some exactly two, some exactly three, and maybe even all four. Oh, right, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. And we need to find how many own all four.

Hmm, okay. So let me note down the given data:

- Total residents (n) = 900
- Diamond ring owners (D) = 195
- Golf clubs owners (G) = 367
- Garden spade owners (S) = 562
- Candy hearts (C) = 900 (since everyone owns it)
- Exactly two items owners (exactly two) = 437
- Exactly three items owners (exactly three) = 234
- We need to find exactly four items owners (exactly four) = ?

Wait a second, so each resident owns at least the candy hearts, but some own more. So all the other items are subsets of the entire population, but everyone has the candy hearts. So when considering the union of D, G, S, we have to remember that all 900 own C, so we can model this as a four-set problem where the universal set is 900, and each of D, G, S, and C are sets within it.

Wait, but since everyone owns C, perhaps we can think of the problem as the union of D, G, S, but within the universal set of 900. So maybe the inclusion-exclusion principle applies here, but with some adjustments because we have some counts of exactly two and exactly three.

So, let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But in this case, we also have the fourth set, C, but since everyone owns C, every other set is a subset of C. Wait, actually, no. Because C is a separate item, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So actually, C is a universal set here. So the problem is about D, G, S, and C. But since everyone owns C, the union of D, G, S is within C. So the total number of residents is 900, and the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S could be less than or equal to 900. But since C is owned by everyone, perhaps the way to model this is to consider the other three items as sets within the universal set of C.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is not just about D, G, S, but also about C, which is owned by everyone. So all four items are being considered, and we're to find the number of people who own all four.

But wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So C is universal. So when considering the sets, all the other ownerships (D, G, S) are subsets of C. So the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is |D ∪ G ∪ S|, and since everyone owns C, that's equal to the number of people who own at least one of the four items.
