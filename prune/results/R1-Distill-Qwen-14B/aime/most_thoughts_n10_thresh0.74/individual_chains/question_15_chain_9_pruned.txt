Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner. The paths have to change direction exactly four times, and each path is of length 16. Hmm, I need to figure out how to model this.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, you have to make 8 moves to the right and 8 moves up, totaling 16 moves. So each path is a sequence of 8 rights and 8 ups.

Now, the problem says the path changes direction exactly four times. I think that means the path alternates between moving right and up, but only four times. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Changing direction could mean from right to up or up to right. So each time the path changes from one direction to the other, that's a direction change. So if I have a path that alternates direction every step, that's a lot of direction changes, but here we need exactly four.

Let me think. Each direction change corresponds to a switch from right to up or up to right. Since the path starts at the lower left, which is the origin (0,0), the first move is either right or up. Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, starting from (0,0), to get to (8,8), you need 8 rights and 8 ups in some order.

So a path is a permutation of 8 R's and 8 U's. The total number of such paths is C(16,8), which is 12870, but we don't need all of them, just those that change direction exactly four times.

How does the direction change relate to the sequence of R's and U's? Each time the direction changes, it's because the next move is different from the previous one.

Let me consider how the sequence is built. Suppose the path starts with R, then changes direction to U, then back to R, and so on. Each change is a switch to the other direction.

So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. For example, RRRUUURRU would have three runs of R and three runs of U, so the number of direction changes is two for each switch, but wait, actually the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs.

Wait, let's clarify. If you have a path that goes RRUURRUU, that's two runs of R and two runs of U, right? So the direction changes occur between R and U, and U and R, so each run switch is a direction change.

Therefore, the number of direction changes is equal to (number of runs - 1). So, if a path has k runs, it has (k - 1) direction changes.

In our problem, we need paths with exactly four direction changes. So, that would mean the number of runs is five. Because 4 direction changes = 5 runs.

So, for example, a path that goes RRRRRUUUUUUUU would have 2 runs, so 1 direction change.
