Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of the squares of a list of positive integers. The list has some specific properties: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what each term means. The sum being 30 is straightforwardâ€”when I add up all the numbers in the list, it should equal 30. The mode is the number that appears most frequently, and it's unique, meaning only 9 is the mode. That tells me that 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. And the median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. But here, the median is a positive integer that's not in the list. That's a bit tricky because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list.

So, let me think about how to approach this. I'll probably need to figure out how many numbers are in the list first. Let me denote the number of elements as n. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, n must be even. Because if n were odd, the median would be the middle number, which would have to be in the list. So n must be even. Let's say n=2k for some integer k.

Wait, but I don't know the value of k yet. Let me see if I can get more information. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. So how many times does 9 appear? Well, to be the unique mode, it must appear at least twice, and more than any other number.

Let me think about possible scenarios. Maybe the list is something like [9,9,9,...], but then the sum would be too high if there are too many 9s. Let's see: if I have, say, four 9s, that's 36, which is already more than 30. So that's impossible. So the number of 9s can't be too high. Let me try to figure out the maximum number of 9s possible without exceeding the sum of 30.

Wait, but maybe the number of 9s is just enough to make it the mode. Let's try with two 9s. Then other numbers can appear at most once. Wait, but if I have two 9s and other numbers appearing once, then 9 is the mode. But let's see, maybe more 9s are possible. Let me do some calculations.

Let me suppose that the number of 9s is m. Then the sum contributed by the 9s is 9m. The remaining sum is 30 - 9m, which has to be distributed among the other numbers in the list, each of which is a positive integer, and none can be 9 because 9 is the mode.

Also, the list must have a median that's not present in the list. So the median is an integer, but not in the list. Let me think about how the median is determined. If the list is ordered, the median is the average of the two middle numbers when n is even. But since the median is an integer, that average must be an integer, so the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd so that their average is an integer. But the median is not in the list itself, which implies that the two middle numbers are not equal. Because if they were equal, the median would be that number, which would have to be in the list. So the two middle numbers must be two different integers, and their average is the median. So, the median is not present in the list.

So, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer not in the list.

Let me try to structure this. Let's say the list is in ascending order: a1, a2, ..., a_n, where a_n is the largest number. Since the sum is 30 and all numbers are positive integers, each a_i >=1.

Given that, let's try to think of possible n. Since the median is not in the list, n must be even. Let me consider possible even n.

Let me try n=6. So, for n=6, the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th terms. Let's denote them as a3 and a4. The median is (a3 + a4)/2, which must be an integer not in the list. So (a3 + a4) must be even, so a3 and a4 are both even or both odd.

Now, since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So in the list of 6 numbers, 9 must appear at least twice, and more than any other number. So if 9 appears twice, the other numbers can appear at most once. But if 9 appears three times, that's better for the mode.

Wait, but let's try with 9 appearing three times. Then the list would have three 9s. Let's see if that's possible. Sum contributed by 9s is 27. Then, the remaining sum is 3. So, the other three numbers must add up to 3, each at least 1. So, those would be three 1s, since 1+1+1=3. Then, the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9], but wait, that's six elements, but the median would be the average of the third and fourth elements, which are 1 and 9. So (1+9)/2 = 5, which is an integer not in the list. So
