Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here. Let me try to parse it. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. And I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help. Let me write down what I know.

First, log_x(y^x) = 10. I know that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that property here, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Right? Because the exponent x is brought out front.

Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same property, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Got that.

So now, I have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10
2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm. Let me think about these logarithms. I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). That could be useful here.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A. So substituting into the equations:

1) x * A = 10
2) 4y * (1/A) = 10

So now, equation 1 is xA = 10, and equation 2 is (4y)/A = 10.

Hmm, so I can express x and y in terms of A. Let's see.

From equation 1: x = 10 / A.

From equation 2: (4y)/A = 10 → 4y = 10A → y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2.

So now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of A. But I need another equation to relate them. Maybe I can use the relationship between x and y through the logarithm.

Wait, A is log_x(y). Which is the same as ln(y)/ln(x). So, A = ln(y)/ln(x). Hmm, or using change of base formula.

But since I have x and y in terms of A, maybe I can substitute into that.

So, x = 10/A and y = (5A)/2.

Therefore, A = log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x) = [ln(5A/2)] / [ln(10/A)]

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can set it up as an equation in terms of A.

So, A = [ln(5A/2)] / [ln(10/A)]

Let me write that as:

A * ln(10/A) = ln(5A/2)

Hmm, this looks a bit messy, but perhaps I can simplify it.

Let me denote ln(10/A) as something. Wait, maybe it's better to take exponents on both sides to eliminate the logarithms.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the relationship between x and y.

Wait, from x = 10/A and y = (5A)/2, maybe I can relate x and y through these expressions.

Let me express A in terms of x: A = 10/x.

Then, y = (5A)/2 = (5*(10/x))/2 = (50)/(2x) = 25/x.

So, y = 25/x.

Oh, that's a nice relationship. So, y is 25 divided by x. So, x and y are reciprocals scaled by 25. So, their product is 25. Wait, that would mean xy = 25. But wait, let me make sure this is correct.

Wait, because from above, we have y = 25/x. So, xy = x*(25/x) = 25. So, is that the answer?

Wait, hold on. Let me check if this is consistent with the original equations.

Assume that y = 25/x. Let's plug this into equation 1 and 2.

First, equation 1: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Substituting y with 25/x, we get log_x( (25/x)^x ) = 10.

Simplify the argument: (25/x)^x = (25^x)/(x^x) = (25/ x)^x.

Wait, log_x( (25/x)^x ) = log_x(25^
