Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a list of positive integers with three main properties: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items.

First, let me understand each property.

1. **Sum is 30**: The total of all numbers in the list is 30. So, if there are 'n' numbers, their sum is 30.

2. **Unique mode is 9**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently. And it's unique, meaning no other number appears as many times as 9. So, 9 occurs more times than any other number.

3. **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. Since the median isn't in the list, it must be a number that's between two numbers in the list, but it's an integer itself. So, the median must be the average of two middle numbers. Wait, but the median has to be an integer, so the two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer. That means the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd.

Let me think about the structure of the list.

Since the mode is 9, which appears more than any other number, let's denote the number of times 9 appears as 'k'. Then, all other numbers can appear at most 'k-1' times.

Now, since the median is not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements because the median of an even list is the average of two middle numbers. Wait, no—if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is an integer and must not appear in the list? Wait, that's a contradiction because if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is one of the elements, which would have to be 9 if 9 is the mode. But the median isn't allowed to be in the list. So, that suggests the list has an even number of elements.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say the list has 'n' elements. If n is odd, the median is the (n+1)/2-th element. Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, but the median is one of the elements in the list, that's impossible. Hence, the list must have an even number of elements so that the median is the average of two middle numbers, which might not be in the list.

So, n is even. Let's say n = 2m, where m is an integer. Then, the median is the average of the m-th and (m+1)-th elements.

Therefore, the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which is an integer. So, a_m and a_{m+1} must be both even or both odd.

Now, since the list is in ascending order, a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_{2m}.

We also know that the mode is 9, which occurs more frequently than
