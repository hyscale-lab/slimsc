Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse through it step by step. Hmm, it's a problem involving sets and maybe using some inclusion-exclusion principle. I remember that from my combinatorics class. Let me jot down the key points:

- Total residents: 900
- Number of residents owning each item:
  - Diamond ring (D): 195
  - Golf clubs (G): 367
  - Garden spade (S): 562
  - Bag of candy hearts (H): Well, it says each resident owns a bag, so that's 900.
  
Wait, so H is universal here. Everyone has a candy heart bag. So when considering overlaps, the only possible overlaps are with H, right? Or maybe not, because the problem is about owning exactly two or three things. Hmm, wait, maybe I need to consider all four items.

Wait, the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So H is 900. So every resident has H. So when we're talking about owning other things, we have to consider that H is always present.

Now, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Wait, but the question is about how many own all four. That would be those who own D, G, S, and H.

Wait, but H is everyone, so the only thing to figure out is the
