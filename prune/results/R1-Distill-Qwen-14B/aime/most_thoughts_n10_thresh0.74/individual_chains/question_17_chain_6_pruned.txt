Okay, so I've got this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a specific surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the problem says that B is the set of rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. So, each box in set B has these two properties. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, which means I need to figure out the maximum possible space diagonal of the boxes because the sphere's diameter has to be at least the space diagonal of the box.

Wait, right, the sphere that contains the box must have a radius equal to half of the box's space diagonal. So, if I can find the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, then I can divide that by 2 to get the radius, and then square it for the final answer.

But how do I find that maximum space diagonal? I think I should start by defining the variables for the box. Let me let the length, width, and height be x, y, z respectively.

So, the surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. And the volume is xyz = 23.

I need to find the space diagonal, which is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, I need to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²), but since the square root is a monotonic function, I can instead maximize x² + y² + z².

So, my goal is to maximize x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that Lagrange multipliers might be useful here. But I also recall that sometimes you can use inequalities like AM ≥ GM or other symmetric inequalities to find maxima or minima.

Let me think about whether I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and volume.

I know that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, if I can find (x + y + z)², then I can get x² + y² + z² by subtracting 2(xy + yz + xz).

Given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, so xy + yz + xz = 27. Then, (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 54. Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 54.

So, to find x² + y² + z², I need to find (x + y + z)². But how?

I also know that for positive real numbers, the Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality applies. So, for three variables, (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3). Given that xyz = 23, so (xyz)^(1/3) = cube root of 23. Let me calculate that approximately, but maybe I don't need the exact value.

So, AM ≥ GM gives (x + y + z)/3 ≥ cube root of 23. Therefore, x + y + z ≥ 3 * cube root of 23. That gives me a lower bound on x + y + z. But I'm looking for an upper bound on x² + y² + z², which depends on (x + y + z)^2.

Wait, maybe I can use other inequalities. Let me recall that for positive numbers, the sum of squares is minimized when the variables are equal, but in my case, I need to maximize it. So, the maximum sum of squares occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible, given the constraints.

But given that the product xyz is fixed at 23, I can't have one variable extremely large without the other two being small. So, perhaps the maximum of x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal and the third is determined by the constraints.

Let me assume that two variables are equal, say, y = z. Then, maybe this will help me find the maximum. Let's set y = z.

So, if y = z, then the surface area equation becomes 2(xy + yz + xz) = 2(x y + y^2 + x y) = 2(2xy + y^2) = 54. So, 2xy + y² = 27.

Also, the volume equation is x y^2 = 23. So, x = 23 / y².

Substituting x into the surface area equation: 2*(23 / y²)*y + y² = 27.

Simplify that: (46 / y) + y² = 27.

So, y² + (46 / y) = 27.

Multiply both sides by y to eliminate the denominator: y^3 + 46 = 27y.

Bring all terms to one side: y^3 -27y +46 =0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Maybe I can factor it.

Let me try y=2: 8 -54 +46= 8-54= -46 +46=0. Oh, y=2 is a root.

So, I can factor it as (y -2)(y² + 2y -23)=0.

So, the roots are y=2, and y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since y must be positive, we have y=2 and y= -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let's compute that:

sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so 2*sqrt(6) is about 4.898. So, -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible solutions for y are 2 and approximately 3.898.

So, for y=2, then x =23/(y²)=23/4=5.75.

Then, since y=z=2, the dimensions are x=5.75, y=2, z=2.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z² for this case.

x² is (5.75)^2 = 33.0625. y² + z² is 4 +4=8. So, total is 33.0625 +8=41.0625.

Alternatively, for y≈3.898, then x=23/(y²). Let's compute y= -1 + 2*sqrt(6)=exact value is better.

Wait, let's keep it exact. Let me write y= 2*sqrt(6)-1.

Wait, no, it's y= -1 + 2*sqrt(6). So, y=2*sqrt(6)-1.

So, y² is (2*sqrt(6)-1)^2= (2*sqrt(6))^2 - 2*(2*sqrt(6))*1 +1^2= 24 -4*sqrt(6)+1=25 -4*sqrt(6).

Then, x=23 / y²=23/(25 -4*sqrt(6)).

To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4*sqrt(6)):

x=23*(25 +4*sqrt(6))/[(25)^2 - (4*sqrt(6))^2] = 23*(25 +4*sqrt(6))/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4*sqrt(6))/(625-96)=23*(25 +4*sqrt(6))/529.

Simplify 23/529: 23*23=529, so 23/529=1/23. So, x= (25 +4*sqrt(6))/23.

Therefore, x≈ (25 +4*2.449)/23≈(25 +9.796)/23≈34.796/23≈1.513.

So, the dimensions would be x≈1.513, y≈3.898, z≈3.898.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z².

x²≈(1.513)^2≈2.289.

y²≈(3.898)^2≈15.193. Similarly, z²≈15.193.

So, total x² + y² + z²≈2.289 +15.193 +15.193≈32.675.

Wait, that's less than the previous case where x=5.75, y=2, z=2, which gave 41.0625. So, in the first case, with y=2, the sum of squares is larger.

Therefore, setting two variables equal gives me two possible solutions, and the one with y=2 gives a larger sum of squares. So, that's a better candidate for the maximum.

But is that the maximum possible? Or could the sum of squares be even larger when all three variables are different?

Hmm, that's a good question. Maybe I should consider whether the maximum occurs when two variables are equal or when all three are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum sum of squares occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible, subject to the constraints.

But since the product xyz is fixed, making one variable larger would require the other two to be smaller, but how that affects the sum of squares isn't straightforward.

Wait, let's think about it: if I fix the product xyz=23, and the surface area 2(xy+yz+xz)=54, perhaps the sum x² + y² + z² is maximized when the box is as "stretched out" as possible, meaning one dimension is large and the other two are small.

But I need to check if that's actually the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, as we saw earlier, so maybe the case where y=z=2, x=23/4=5.75 is the maximum.

But wait, let's see.

Is there a way to express x² + y² + z² in terms that can be optimized?

Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers.

Let me try that approach. Let me consider the function f(x,y,z)=x² + y² + z², which we need to maximize, subject to the constraints g(x,y,z)=2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and h(x,y,z)=xyz=23.

So, to use Lagrange multipliers, I need to set up the gradients.

But with two constraints, I might need to use a method involving multiple Lagrange multipliers or perhaps reduce the problem to fewer variables.

Alternatively, since we have two constraints, perhaps I can parameterize two variables and express the third in terms of them.

Wait, maybe it's better to reduce the problem to two variables. Let me let x = a, and y = b, so z can be expressed in terms of a and b.

From the volume constraint: z = 23/(ab).

Then, substitute into the surface area equation:

2(ab + b z + a z) =54.

Substituting z:

2(ab + b*(23/(ab)) + a*(23/(ab))) =54.

Simplify:

2(ab + (23/(a) + 23/(b))) =54.

Divide both sides by 2:

ab + (23/a +23/b)=27.

So, ab + 23(1/a +1/b)=27.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.

Our goal is to maximize x² + y² + z² = a² + b² + (23/(ab))².

So, the function to maximize is f(a,b) = a² + b² + (529)/(a² b²).

Subject to the constraint g(a,b)=ab +23(1/a +1/b) -27=0.

This seems a bit tricky, but perhaps we can use substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps assuming symmetry, like setting a = b, to see if that gives a maximum.

Wait, earlier when I set y = z, which would correspond to a = b, I found a solution. Let's see if that is indeed the maximum.

If a = b, then:

g(a,a) = a² +23(2/a) =a² +46/a=27.

So, a² +46/a=27.

Multiply both sides by a: a^3 +46=27a.

Which gives a^3 -27a +46=0.

Earlier, we saw that this equation has a root at a=2,
