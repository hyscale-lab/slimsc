Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that a rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles. Wait, is that always true? No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Oh wait, no, wait. No, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. That's a key property. So, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin.

So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y) because the origin is the midpoint. Similarly, points B and D must be symmetric about the origin as well. So, if point B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be found using the lengths of the diagonals.

Wait, in a rhombus, the area can be calculated as (d1*d2)/2 where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, the sides can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: each side is sqrt((d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2).

But maybe another approach is better. Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, each of their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation.

So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Let me denote the coordinates of A, B, C, D as follows:

A: (x1, y1)
B: (x2, y2)
C: (-x1, -y1)
D: (-x2, -y2)

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should all have the same length.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they intersect at the origin, and are perpendicular.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

So, the vector AC is ( -x1 - x1, -y1 - y1 ) = (-2x1, -2y1), but wait, point A is (x1, y1) and point C is (-x1, -y1), so the vector AC is from A to C: (-2x1, -2y1). Similarly, the vector BD is from B to D: (-2x2, -2y2).

But since AC and BD are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.

So, AC · BD = (-2x1)(-2x2) + (-2y1)(-2y2) = 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0.

Divide both sides by 4: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

So, the condition is x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

Also, points A, B are on the hyperbola, so:

x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1

x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1

So, I have these two equations for points A and B, and the orthogonality condition between vectors AC and BD.

But wait, maybe I can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola.

I know that hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, a parametrization is (a cosh θ, b sinh θ). Alternatively, sometimes it's (a sec t, b tan t), but that might not cover all points. Wait, hyperbola parametrization is a bit tricky because it's not periodic like circle.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use coordinates in terms of slopes or something else.

But perhaps another approach: since diagonals are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, and the rhombus is formed by points on the hyperbola.

Wait, another thought: the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Since the origin is the midpoint, then AC is the line connecting (x1, y1) and (-x1, -y1), which is the line through the origin in the direction (x1, y1). Similarly, BD is the line through the origin in the direction (x2, y2).

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are perpendicular. So, x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

So, that's the condition we had earlier.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, the distance from the origin to each vertex must satisfy certain properties.

Wait, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.

But maybe it's more straightforward to compute the distance between points.

So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C.

Compute AB²: (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2

Compute BC²: (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2

Set them equal:

(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2

Expanding both sides:

Left side: x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1²

Right side: (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2 = x1² + 2x1x2 + x2² + y1² + 2y1y2 + y2²

Set left equal to right:

x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1² = x1² + 2x1x2 + x2² + y1² + 2y1y2 + y2²

Simplify both sides:

Left: x1² + x2² + y1² + y2² - 2x1x2 - 2y1y2

Right: x1² + x2² + y1² + y2² + 2x1x2 + 2y1y2

Subtract the right side from the left side:

(-2x1x2 - 2y1y2) - (2x1x2 + 2y1y2) = 0

Which gives:

-4x1x2 -4y1y2 = 0

Simplify:

x1x2 + y1y2 = 0

Wait, that's the same as the orthogonality condition we had earlier. So, this condition is necessary for the rhombus.

So, perhaps the key condition is x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

So, now, we have points A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) on the hyperbola, with x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

We need to find BD². BD is the distance between B and D, but D is (-x2, -y2). So, BD is the distance between (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2), which is sqrt[(2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2] = 2*sqrt(x2² + y2²). So, BD² is (2*sqrt(x2² + y2²))² = 4(x2² + y2²).

Wait, but BD is the diagonal, so BD² is [distance between B and D]^2, but since diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the length of BD is 2*sqrt(x2² + y2²). So, BD² is 4(x2² + y2²).

Similarly, AC² is 4(x1² + y1²). So, AC and BD are the diagonals, with lengths 2*sqrt(x1² + y1²) and 2*sqrt(x2² + y2²).

But since all four points are on the hyperbola, each point satisfies x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, for point A: x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1

Similarly, for point B: x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1

So, perhaps I can express y1² and y2² in terms of x1² and x2².

From point A: y1² = (x1²/20 - 1)*24

Similarly, y2² = (x2²/20 - 1)*24

So, BD² = 4(x2² + y2²) = 4[ x2² + ( (x2²/20 -1 )*24 ) ]

Simplify that:

= 4[ x2² + ( (24/20)x2² -24 ) ]

= 4[ x2² + (6x2²/5 -24) ]

= 4[ (5x2² +6x2²)/5 -24 ]

= 4[ (11x2²/5) -24 ]

= 4*(11x2²/5 -24 ) = (44x2²)/5 - 96

Similarly, AC² = 4(x1² + y1²) = 4[ x1² + (24/20 x1² -24) ] = same as above, 44x1²/5 -96.

But perhaps I don't need AC², but maybe I do.

Wait, but the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, I need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombuses, and then the greatest number less than BD² would be the infimum.

Wait, no, wait, the problem says the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, that would be the infimum of BD², because BD² can get arbitrarily close to the infimum from above, but not less than it.

So, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD², and then the answer is that minimum value.

Wait, but is BD² bounded below? Let's see.

BD² is 44x2²/5 -96. So, BD² is a linear function in terms of x2². Since x2² must satisfy the hyperbola equation, x2² must be greater than or equal to 20*(1 + y2²/24). Wait, no, actually, for the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1, so x² = 20(1 + y²/24). So, x² is at least 20, since y² is non-negative.

So, x2² ≥20. So, x2² is ≥20.

Therefore, BD² = (44/5)x2² -96. Since x2² ≥20, BD² ≥ (44/5)*20 -96 = 44*4 -96 = 176 -96=80.

So, BD² is ≥80.

But wait, that's a lower bound. But does BD² actually attain 80? Or is there a lower value?

Wait, if x2²=20, then BD²= (44/5)*20 -96= 176 -96=80.

So, BD²=80 when x2²=20. So, can x2²=20?

Yes, if x2²=20, then from the hyperbola equation, y2²= (x2²/20 -1)*24= (1 -1)*24=0. So, y2²=0, which means y2=0.

So, point B would be (sqrt(20),0) or (-sqrt(20),0), etc.

But wait, if point B is (sqrt(20),0), then point D is (-sqrt(20),0). Then, the other points A and C must also lie on the hyperbola, and satisfy x1x2 + y1y2=0.

So, x2 is sqrt(20), y2=0. So, x1*sqrt(20) + y1*0=0 => x1=0.

But if x1=0, then from the hyperbola equation: 0 - y1²/24=1 => y1²= -24, which is impossible. So, that's a problem.

So, x2²=20 would require x1=0, which is not possible as it would lead to an imaginary y1.

Therefore, x2² cannot be 20. So, the lower bound of 80 is not attainable. So, BD² must be greater than 80.

Hmm, so what's the minimum BD² then?

I need another approach.

Let me consider that points A and B lie on the hyperbola, with x1x2 + y1y2=0.

From the hyperbola equation, I can express y1 and y2 in terms of x1 and x2.

Wait, for point A: y1² = (x1²/20 -1)*24

Similarly, for point B: y2² = (x2²/20 -1)*24

So, let me denote y1 = sqrt(24*(x1²/20 -1)) and y2 = sqrt(24*(x2²/20 -1)).

But since x1x2 + y1y2=0, which is x1x2 = -y1y2.

But since x1 and x2 are real numbers, and y1 and y2 are real numbers as well.

Wait, but y1 and y2 can be positive or negative. So, perhaps I can write y1 = k x1 and y2 = l x2, but with some conditions.

Wait, but given that x1x2 + y1y2 =0, perhaps I can express y1 in terms of x1 and x2, y2.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize points A and B such that they lie on the hyperbola, and satisfy x1x2 + y1y2=0.

Alternatively, think of the points A and B as vectors from the origin, and the condition is that their dot product is zero, so vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.

Wait, OA is (x1, y1), OB is (x2, y2). So, OA · OB = x1x2 + y1y2 =0.

So, points A and B are such that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.

So, in other words, points A and B lie on the hyperbola and are perpendicular vectors from the origin.

So, the problem reduces to finding two points on the hyperbola whose position vectors are perpendicular, and then finding BD², which is 4(x2² + y2²), and then finding the greatest lower bound for BD².

So, now, we can model this as an optimization problem.

We need to minimize BD² = 4(x2² + y2²) subject to the conditions that (x1²)/20 - (y1²)/24 =1, (x2²)/20 - (y2²)/24 =1, and x1x2 + y1y2=0.

So, with these three constraints, we can set up a Lagrangian.

But maybe another approach: since OA and OB are perpendicular, and both points lie on hyperbola.

So, given OA · OB =0.

Let me express this in terms of coordinates.

Let me suppose that point A is (x, y), then point B must satisfy x2x + y2y=0.

But also, point B is on the hyperbola, so x2²/20 - y2²/24=1.

So, maybe we can parameterize point A as (x, y) and then find point B such that x2x + y2y=0, with B on the hyperbola.

Alternatively, a better approach could be to parametrize point A in terms of a parameter, then express point B accordingly.

Let me parametrize point A as (x, y) on the hyperbola. Then, point B must satisfy x2x + y2y=0.

So, x2 = (-y2 y)/x, assuming x≠0.

But since point B is on the hyperbola, substitute x2 and y2 into the hyperbola equation.

Wait, point B is (x2, y2) = ( (-y2 y)/x, y2 )

Wait, no, that seems conflicting. Wait, x2 = (-y2 y)/x, so we can write x2 in terms of y2, and then substitute into the hyperbola equation for point B.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y2 in terms of x2.

Alternatively, let's consider that OA and OB are perpendicular. So, if OA is (x, y), then OB is a vector perpendicular to OA, so it can be written as (k*(-y), k*x) for some scalar k.

But since point B is on the hyperbola, we can substitute into the hyperbola equation.

So, if point B is ( -ky, kx ), then plugging into the hyperbola equation:

( (-ky)^2 ) /20 - ( (kx)^2 ) /24 =1

Which is (k² y²)/20 - (k² x²)/24 =1

Factor out k²:

k² [ y²/20 - x²/24 ] =1

But we also know that point A is (x, y) on the hyperbola, so x²/20 - y²/24=1.

Notice that y²/20 - x²/24 = -(x²/20 - y²/24) = -1.

So, substituting back, k²*(-1)=1 =>k²= -1.

Wait, that's a problem because k² can't be negative. Hmm, so this suggests that if we parametrize point B as a scalar multiple of a perpendicular vector to OA, then the only solution is k= imaginary, which isn't possible for real points.

Hmm, so this suggests that points A and B cannot be scalar multiples of perpendicular vectors? Or perhaps I made a wrong parametrization.

Wait, perhaps I should parametrize point B as (my, -mx), which is perpendicular to OA=(x, y). So, OA · OB = x*(my) + y*(-mx)= mxy - mxy=0. So, that's correct.

So, point B is (my, -mx). Now, plug into hyperbola equation:

(my)^2 /20 - (-mx)^2 /24 =1

So, (m² y²)/20 - (m² x²)/24 =1

Factor out m²:

m² [ y²/20 - x²/24 ] =1

Again, from point A, x²/20 - y²/24 =1. So, y²/20 - x²/24= -1.

So, m²*(-1)=1 => m²= -1. Again, same problem. So, m is imaginary. Which suggests that there's a problem with this approach.

Wait, so perhaps points A and B cannot be obtained by scaling a perpendicular vector. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps parametrize in terms of angles.

Wait, let me consider polar coordinates. Let me set point A as (r cosθ, r sinθ), but adjusted for the hyperbola.

But hyperbola in polar coordinates is more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe parametrize using hyperbola parameters.

Recall that the hyperbola can be parametrized as (a secφ, b tanφ). So, for our hyperbola, a²=20, so a=2√5, and b²=24, so b=2√6.

So, point A can be (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ). Similarly, point B must satisfy x1x2 + y1y2=0.

So, let me write this out:

x1 = 2√5 secφ

y1 = 2√6 tanφ

So, x1x2 + y1y2 =0

=> (2√5 secφ) x2 + (2√6 tanφ) y2 =0

Divide both sides by 2:

√5 secφ x2 + √6 tanφ y2 =0

So, √5 x2 / cosφ + √6 y2 (sinφ / cosφ )=0

Multiply both sides by cosφ:

√5 x2 + √6 y2 sinφ =0

So, this gives an equation relating x2 and y2 in terms of φ.

But point B is also on the hyperbola, so x2²/20 - y2²/24 =1

So, we have two equations:

1) √5 x2 + √6 y2 sinφ =0

2) x2²/20 - y2²/24 =1

Let me solve equation 1 for x2:

√5 x2 = -√6 y2 sinφ

=> x2 = (-√6 / √5) y2 sinφ

Now, substitute x2 into equation 2:

[ (-√6 / √5 y2 sinφ )² ] /20 - y2² /24 =1

Compute the first term:

( (6/5) y2² sin²φ ) /20 = (6 y2² sin²φ ) / (5*20 )= (6 y2² sin²φ ) / 100 = (3 y2² sin²φ ) /50

So, equation becomes:

(3 y2² sin²φ ) /50 - y2² /24 =1

Factor out y2²:

y2² [ 3 sin²φ /50 - 1/24 ] =1

Let me compute the coefficient:

3 sin²φ /50 - 1/24 = (3*24 sin²φ - 50 ) / (50*24 )

So, numerator: 72 sin²φ -50

Denominator:1200

So, the equation becomes:

y2² * (72 sin²φ -50)/1200 =1

Thus,

y2² = 1200 / (72 sin²φ -50 )

But y2² must be positive, so denominator must be positive.

So,

72 sin²φ -50 >0

=> 72 sin²φ >50

=> sin²φ >50/72 =25/36

=> sinφ >5/6 or sinφ < -5/6

So, sinφ must be outside (-5/6,5/6). So, φ must be in certain ranges.

Now, y2² =1200 / (72 sin²φ -50 )

So, BD² =4(x2² + y2² )

We have x2 = (-√6 /√5 ) y2 sinφ

So, x2² = (6/5) y2² sin²φ

Thus, BD²=4 [ (6/5 y2² sin²φ ) + y2² ]

=4 y2² [ (6/5 sin²φ ) +1 ]

=4 y2² [ (6 sin²φ +5)/5 ]

So, BD²= (4/5)(6 sin²φ +5) y2²

But y2²=1200/(72 sin²φ -50 )

So, plug that in:

BD²= (4/5) (6 sin²φ +5 ) * [1200 / (72 sin²φ -50 ) ]

Simplify:

= (4/5) * (6 sin²φ +5 ) * (1200 ) / (72 sin²φ -50 )

= (4/5 *1200 ) * (6 sin²φ +5 ) / (72 sin²φ -50 )

Compute 4/5 *1200= 4*240=960

So, BD²= 960*(6 sin²φ +5 ) / (72 sin²φ -50 )

Now, let me let t = sin²φ.

Since sinφ >5/6 or < -5/6, so t >25/36.

So, t >25/36.

So, BD²=960*(6 t +5 ) / (72 t -50 )

Let me write it as:

BD²=960*(6t +5)/(72t -50 )

We can simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:

=960*(3t + 2.5)/(36t -25 )

Wait, maybe factor numerator and denominator differently.

Wait, 72t -50 = 2*(36t -25 )

6t +5 is as is.

So,

BD²= 960*(6t +5 )/(72t -50 ) =960*(6t +5 )/(2*(36t -25 ))= 480*(6t +5 )/(36t -25 )

Now, let me compute this as a function of t, where t >25/36.

So, f(t)=480*(6t +5 )/(36t -25 )

We need to find the minimum value of f(t) for t>25/36.

To find the minimum, we can take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it to zero.

Let me compute f(t):

f(t)=480*(6t +5)/(36t -25 )

Let me denote u=6t+5, v=36t -25.

Then, f(t)=480*u/v.

Compute derivative f’(t)=480*(u’v -uv’)/v²

Compute u’=6, v’=36.

So,

f’(t)=480*(6*(36t-25) - (6t+5)*36 )/(36t -25 )²

Simplify numerator:

6*(36t -25 )=216t -150

(6t +5 )*36=216t +180

So,

Numerator=216t -150 - (216t +180 )=216t -150 -216t -180= (-330 )

So,

f’(t)=480*(-330 )/(36t -25 )²

So, f’(t)= -480*330 / (36t -25 )²= negative value.

So, since f’(t) is negative for all t>25/36, the function f(t) is decreasing in t.

Therefore, the minimum of f(t) occurs as t approaches its maximum? Wait, wait, no: since f(t) is decreasing in t, as t increases, f(t) decreases. So, the infimum of f(t) is when t approaches infinity.

Wait, but t is sin²φ, so t can be up to 1, since sin²φ ≤1.

Wait, but earlier, t>25/36≈0.6944. So, t ∈ (25/36,1]

So, since f(t) is decreasing in t, the minimal value is achieved as t approaches 1 from below.

Compute f(t) as t approaches 1:

lim t→1- f(t)=480*(6*1 +5)/(36*1 -25 )=480*(11)/(11)=480*(1)=480.

Wait, but when t=1, sin²φ=1, so sinφ=±1, which is allowed.

So, when t=1, f(t)=480*(6+5)/(36-25)=480*11/11=480.

But when t approaches 25/36 from above, what happens to f(t)?

Compute lim t→(25/36)+ f(t)=480*(6*(25/36)+5 )/(72*(25/36)-50 )

Wait, 6*(25/36)=25/6≈4.1667

So, 6t +5=25/6 +5=25/6 +30/6=55/6≈9.1667

Denominator:72t -50=72*(25/36) -50=2*25 -50=50 -50=0

So, as t approaches 25/36 from above, denominator approaches zero from positive side (since 72t -50 approaches zero, and t>25/36, so 72t -50 approaches 0+).

So, f(t) approaches infinity.

So, the function f(t) decreases from +infinity to 480 as t goes from 25/36 to 1.

So, the minimal value of BD² is 480, achieved when t=1.

But wait, when t=1, sin²φ=1, so sinφ=±1, so φ=π/2 or 3π/2.

So, point A would be (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ )

At φ=π/2, secφ is undefined, because cosφ=0. Similarly for 3π/2. So, this suggests that when t approaches 1, φ approaches π/2, so secφ approaches infinity, which would mean that point A is moving towards infinity on the hyperbola.

But in that case, point B would be determined accordingly.

Wait, but when φ approaches π/2, point A approaches (infinite x, y=2√6 tanφ≈2√6 ). But then point B would be constrained by x1x2 + y1y2=0.

Wait, but as point A goes to infinity, point B's coordinates would have to adjust so that x1x2 + y1y2=0.

But in this case, when φ approaches π/2, x1 approaches infinity, y1 approaches 2√6.

So, from the condition x1x2 + y1y2=0, we have x2≈ (-y2 y1)/x1≈0, since x1 approaches infinity.

So, x2 approaches zero.

Then, point B approaches (0, y2), which from the hyperbola equation x2²/20 - y2²/24=1, when x2=0, we have -y2²/24=1 => y2²=-24, which is impossible.

Wait, so this suggests that as t approaches 1, point B cannot exist on the hyperbola. So, there's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the limit. Since when t approaches 1, sinφ approaches 1, so φ approaches π/2, but perhaps the parametrization isn't valid there.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal BD² is not 480, but higher.

Wait, let me think again. Since when t approaches 25/36 from above, BD² approaches infinity, and when t approaches 1, BD² approaches 480, but at t=1, point A is at infinity, which is not a valid point on the hyperbola.

Therefore, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but cannot be less than 480. Wait, but earlier, when I considered x2²=20, I got BD²=80, but that was invalid because point A would have x1=0, which isn't possible.

But with this parametrization, the minimal BD² is 480? Wait, but earlier I thought x2²=20 would give BD²=80, but that led to y1 being imaginary. So, perhaps 480 is the minimal value.

But wait, in this parametrization, t can approach 1, making BD² approach 480. So, the infimum of BD² is 480, but it's never actually achieved because at t=1, point A is at infinity.

Therefore, BD² can be made as close to 480 as we like, but it's always greater than 480.

So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses is 480.

Wait, but let me confirm. Let me take a specific example where BD² is slightly above 480.

Suppose t is very close to 1, say t=0.99.

Compute f(t)=480*(6*0.99 +5)/(36*0.99 -25 )

Calculate numerator:6*0.99=5.94; 5.94+5=10.94

Denominator:36*0.99=35.64; 35.64-25=10.64

So, f(t)=480*(10.94)/(10.64 )≈480*(1.0282)≈493.54

Wait, that's higher than 480. Hmm, but when t increases, f(t) decreases.

Wait, when t=0.9, let's compute:

f(t)=480*(6*0.9 +5)/(36*0.9 -25 )

6*0.9=5.4; 5.4+5=10.4

36*0.9=32.4; 32.4-25=7.4

So, f(t)=480*(10.4/7.4 )≈480*(1.4054 )≈674.59

Wait, that's higher than 480. So, as t increases from 25/36≈0.6944 to 1, f(t) decreases from +infinity to 480.

So, when t approaches 1, f(t) approaches 480 from above.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 480, which is the greatest lower bound.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses is 480.

Wait, but earlier when I thought x2²=20, BD²=80, but that led to an imaginary y1. So, perhaps the minimal BD² is 480.

Thus, the answer is 480.


To solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \(ABCD\) on the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, and the origin is their midpoint. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Hyperbola Equation**: Points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola, satisfying \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).
2. **Perpendicular Vectors**: Vectors \(OA\) and \(OB\) are perpendicular, so \(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0\).
3. **Diagonal Lengths**: The length of diagonal \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}\), so \(BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)\).
4. **Parametrization**: Using hyperbola parametrization, express points \(A\) and \(B\) in terms of angles and solve for the minimum \(BD^2\).
5. **Optimization**: Through analysis, it is found that the minimum value of \(BD^2\) approaches \(480\) as the parameter approaches a limit, but it is never actually reached.

### Conclusion:
The greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombuses is \(\boxed{480}\).
