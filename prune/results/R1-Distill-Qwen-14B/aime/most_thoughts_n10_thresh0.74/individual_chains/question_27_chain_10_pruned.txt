Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to understand what the problem is saying and figure out how to approach it.

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle and 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, imagine a donut shape where the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle itself is 3. That makes sense.

Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of the sphere and be internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, or it can rest on the outside and be externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So the torus is inside the sphere in one case and outside in the other. When it's inside, it's tangent along a circle, and similarly when it's outside.

I think I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

Let me recall some properties of tori and spheres. A torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution generated by rotating a circle around an external axis. The key parameters are the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself.

In this case, R = 6 and r = 3. So the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3.

Now, when this torus is tangent to the sphere, the sphere has radius 11. The sphere is fixed, and the torus can be placed inside or outside of it.

I think the key here is to find the point where the torus just touches the sphere, and at that point, the tangent circles will lie on the sphere.

Wait, but how exactly does the tangency work? When the torus is inside the sphere, the largest possible circle it can rest on without intersecting the sphere is the internal tangent. Similarly, when it's outside, the smallest circle it can rest on without intersecting is the external tangent.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the distance between the centers.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside. The sphere's center is at some point, and the torus's center (the center of the generating circle) is also at a distance from the sphere's center.

Wait, maybe I should model this in coordinates. Let me place the sphere S with its center at the origin (0,0,0). Then the torus T can be placed such that its axis of revolution is along the z-axis. Wait, no, wait. When the torus is inside the sphere, the axis is along some line, perhaps the same as the sphere's center.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to
