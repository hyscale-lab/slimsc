Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. 

So, the torus T has a major radius, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and a minor radius, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. Here, major radius R is 6, and minor radius r is 3. 

Then, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases. 

Let me start by recalling some properties of tori and spheres. The torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution, and its tangent planes will touch the sphere at certain circles. The key is to find the radii of these tangent circles.

First, let's consider the internal tangent case. The torus is inside the sphere and tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's externally tangent, the torus is outside the sphere, touching along another circle.

I think I should model the torus and the sphere mathematically. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me assume the sphere S is centered at the origin (0,0,0) for simplicity. Then, the equation of the sphere is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, the torus T is formed by rotating a circle around an axis. Let me think about how to define the torus. The standard equation of a torus centered at the origin, with the axis along the z-axis, is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

In this case, R is the major radius, which is 6, and r is the minor radius, which is 3. So the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle.

Wait, but how exactly is the torus positioned with respect to the sphere? Because the torus is a surface of revolution, its center is at a certain distance from the sphere's center. 

In the internal case, the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, so the center of the torus must be somewhere inside the sphere. Similarly, in the external case, the torus is outside the sphere, touching it.

Wait, actually, the torus is a surface. When it's resting on the inside of the sphere, it's tangent to the sphere at a single circle. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, it's tangent along another circle.

I think I need to find the points where the torus and sphere are tangent. At those points, their tangent planes are the same, so the normals to the surfaces at those points are colinear.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the radius of the circle of tangency by considering the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center.

Wait, maybe I can think of the torus as a surface with a certain center. The center of the generating circle is moving along the axis of revolution. So, for the torus T, which is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, the center
