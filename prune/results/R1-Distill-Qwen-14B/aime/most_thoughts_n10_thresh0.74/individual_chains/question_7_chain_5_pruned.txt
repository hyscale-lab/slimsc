Okay, so I have this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so each color has a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each of which is colored either red or blue. Each color is equally likely, so each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red or blue. Since the colorings are independent, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the problem is about the probability that there's a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. Wait, so in other words, after some rotation, wherever there's a blue vertex now, there was a red vertex before the rotation. Or maybe the other way around? Wait, I need to be careful.

Let me rephrase: we color the octagon's vertices red or blue. Then, we can rotate the octagon (like spinning it), and we want all the blue vertices to end up in positions that were previously red. So, the image of each blue vertex under the rotation must have been a red vertex in the original coloring.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think. So, if we rotate the octagon, then for each vertex that is blue after rotation, the original vertex at that position must have been red. So, for each blue vertex in the rotated octagon, the corresponding original vertex was red. So, the set of blue vertices in the rotated octagon is a subset of the set of red vertices in the original octagon.

But since the octagon is being rotated, the mapping is a permutation of the vertices. So, the blue vertices in the rotated octagon are a permutation (cyclic shift) of the original blue vertices. For all these permuted blue vertices to correspond to original red vertices, the original blue vertices must have been in positions that are red in the rotated octagon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of functions. Let me define some terms.

Letâ€™s denote the original coloring as a function C: {1,
