Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The problem says:

Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Hmm, so I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides some \( n^4 + 1 \), and then for that \( p \), find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, I think I should figure out what primes \( p \) satisfy the condition that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Then, among those primes, I need the smallest one, and then find the smallest \( m \) for that prime.

Let me start by considering small primes and seeing if they satisfy this condition.

The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let me check each one by one.

Starting with \( p = 2 \):

I need to find if there's an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Let me compute \( n^4 \) modulo 4 for \( n = 1, 2, 3, ... \)

When \( n = 1 \): \( 1^4 = 1 \), so \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is 2 mod 4. Not divisible by 4.

\( n = 2 \): \( 2^4 = 16 \), \( 16 + 1 = 17 \). 17 mod 4 is 1. Not divisible by 4.

Wait a second, but 16 mod 4 is 0, so 0 +1 is 1. So that's 1 mod 4.

Wait, maybe I should check all residues modulo 4.

Numbers modulo 4 can be 0, 1, 2, 3.

Compute \( n^4 \) mod 4 for each case:

- If \( n \equiv 0 \mod 4 \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \). So \( n^4 +1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), \( n^4 = 1^4 = 1 \mod 4 \). So \( n^4 +1 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \mod 4 \), \( n^4 = (2)^4 = 16 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \). So \( n^4 +1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \mod 4 \), \( 3^4 = 81 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). So \( n^4 +1 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \).

So in all cases, \( n^4 +1 \) is either 1 or 2 mod 4. So it's never 0 mod 4. Thus, \( p=2 \) doesn't work.

Next prime is \( p=3 \).

Check if \( n^4 +1 \) is divisible by \( 3^2 = 9 \).

So, find if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 9 \).

First, let's check all residues modulo 9, since 9 is manageable.

Compute \( n^4 \) mod 9 for \( n=0 \) to \( n=8 \):

- \( 0^4 = 0 \mod 9 \)
- \( 1^4 = 1 \mod 9 \)
- \( 2^4 = 16 \equiv 7 \mod 9 \)
- \( 3^4 = 81 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \)
- \( 4^4 = (4)^4 = 256 \mod 9 \). Let me compute 4^2=16≡7, then 7^2=49≡4. So 4^4≡4 mod9.
- \( 5^4 \): 5^2=25≡7, 7^2=49≡4. So 5^4≡4 mod9.
- \( 6^4 \): 6^2=36≡0. So 6^4≡0 mod9.
- \(7^4\): 7^2=49≡4, 4^2=16≡7. So 7^4≡7 mod9.
- \(8^4\): 8^2=64≡1, 1^2=1. So 8^4≡1 mod9.

So the possible residues for \( n^4 \) mod 9 are 0,1,4,7.

We want \( n^4 ≡ -1 mod 9 \). Since -1 mod 9 is 8. So looking for \( n^4 ≡8 mod9 \). But from above, none of the residues are 8. So no solution for \( p=3 \).

Thus, \( p=3 \) also doesn't work.

Next prime: \( p=5 \).

Check if \( n^4 +1 \) is divisible by \(5^2=25 \).

We need \( n^4 ≡ -1 mod25 \).

Alternatively, \( n^4 ≡24 mod25 \).

I should check if 24 is a quartic residue mod25.

Alternatively, perhaps I can first check if -1 is a quartic residue modulo 5, then see if it can be lifted using Hensel's lemma or something.

Wait, but maybe I can compute \( n^4 mod25 \) for n from 1 to 24 to see if any give 24.

That might be tedious, but perhaps doable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the possible quartic residues mod25.

But maybe another approach: First, since 5 is a prime, let's see if in the field \( \mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z} \), -1 is a quartic residue.

In \( \mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z} \), the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 4. So the quartic residues are the squares of the quadratic residues.

Wait, let me compute \( n^4 mod5 \):

n | n^4 mod5:
0 → 0
1 →1
2→16≡1
3→81≡1
4→256≡1

So all non-zero n^4 mod5 are 1
