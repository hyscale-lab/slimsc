Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is made by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere has a radius of 11. 

The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I remember that a torus can be described with two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, the circle being revolved has a radius of 3, so the minor radius r is 3. The major radius R is the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution, which is 6. So R = 6 and r = 3.

Now, the sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent internally, and when it's outside, tangent externally. I need to find the radii of the circles along which they're tangent in each case.

Wait, so when the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is a circle on both the torus and the sphere. The same when it's outside. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, respectively.

I think I need to find the maximum and minimum distances from the center of the sphere to the torus, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the points where the torus just touches the sphere.

Let me try to visualize this. The torus is a surface of revolution, so any point on it can be represented in polar coordinates. But perhaps using the parametric equations would be better.

Wait, another approach: The torus can be considered as a surface where each point is at a distance R from the z-axis, and then the tube has radius r. So the equation of the torus in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) is (R - r cos θ)^2 + z^2 = r^2. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

No, actually, the standard equation for a torus in cylindrical coordinates is (R - ρ cos θ)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where ρ is the radial distance in the plane. So ρ would vary depending on θ.

But maybe a better way is to think in terms of the sphere. The sphere has radius 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2.

The torus is inside the sphere, so they're tangent. The point of tangency must satisfy both equations and have a common tangent plane there.

Wait, but the point of tangency is along a
