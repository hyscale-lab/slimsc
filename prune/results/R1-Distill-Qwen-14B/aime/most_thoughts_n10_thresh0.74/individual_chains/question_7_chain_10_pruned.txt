Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally, and vice versa. They mention the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the octagon has eight vertices, each colored red or blue independently. So each vertex has two color choices, and the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's our denominator for the probability.

Now, we're looking for colorings where there's a rotation that swaps all the blue vertices to positions that were originally red. Wait, so this seems like a condition where the coloring is symmetric in some way. Maybe it's related to rotational symmetry?

I remember that a regular octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., up to 315째, and it will look the same. So, for each possible rotation, we can check if the coloring is preserved in a way that blue becomes red and vice versa. But wait, no, actually, the problem says that after rotation, blue vertices end up where red ones were. So it's more like the coloring is mapped to its complement under some rotation.

So, perhaps the coloring is such that when you rotate it by a certain angle, each blue vertex moves to a position that was red, and each red moves to where a blue was. That would mean the coloring is complementary under that rotation.

Let me think about how such a coloring would look. If there's a rotation that takes the coloring to its complement, then the set of blue vertices must be mapped to the set of red vertices under that rotation. Similarly, red mapped to blue.

In group theory terms, the rotation by k positions (for some k) would be an automorphism of the octagon, and the coloring must be invariant under this automorphism but swapped in color. So, the coloring must be a fixed point of the rotation operation, but with the colors inverted.

Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Maybe it's better to consider the orbits of the rotation. If a rotation by k steps maps each vertex to another, then the coloring must be consistent with this mapping in a way that after the rotation, blue vertices go to red positions.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider all possible rotations and check for each rotation whether the coloring is such that the rotation maps blue to red. Then, the probability would be the number of such colorings divided by 256.

But considering all rotations might be a bit complicated. Maybe instead, we can think about the rotation that maps the coloring to its complement. So, for a given coloring, if there exists some rotation that when applied, turns all blue vertices into red and red into blue, then the coloring counts towards our probability.

So, the condition is that the coloring is a "complementary rotation" of itself. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the group of rotations of the octagon, which is the cyclic group C8. For each element g in C8, the rotation by g, we can consider the colorings that are mapped to their complements by g. That is, the coloring C satisfies g(C) = C', where C' is the complement of C.

But since each rotation can be considered as a permutation of the vertices, the coloring must satisfy that under this permutation, each blue vertex is sent to a red vertex and vice versa.

So, for a given rotation g, the number of colorings fixed by g (up to complementation) would be 1 or 2, depending on whether the permutation induced by g has cycles of even or odd length or something like that.

Wait, let me recall Burnside's lemma, which says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points. But I'm not sure if Burnside applies here because we're not counting orbits but rather colorings with a certain property.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of group actions. The group C8 acts on the set of colorings, and we want colorings that are fixed under some nontrivial rotation but in a way that the colors are swapped.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a linear algebra problem. Let's assign to each vertex a variable indicating its color: 0 for red, 1 for blue. Then, a rotation by k steps corresponds to a permutation of these variables. The condition is that the rotation applied to the coloring vector results in the complement of the original vector.

So, for a rotation by k steps, we have P_k * C = 1 + C, where P_k is the permutation matrix corresponding to rotation by k steps, and C is the coloring vector, and 1 is the all-ones vector.

Hmm, but permutation matrices are orthogonal, so P_k^T = P_k^{-1}. Maybe taking the inner product of both sides with P_k^T gives something, but not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the equation P_k * C = 1 + C. Rearranging, we get (P_k - I) * C = 1, where I is the identity matrix. So, for each rotation k, we can consider the system of equations (P_k - I) * C = 1, where each entry is mod 2 (since colors are binary). Wait, but the problem doesn't specify mod 2, but in reality, the colors are either red or blue, so maybe it's over the field GF(2).

Wait, perhaps over GF(2), the field with two elements. So, if we consider the equation (P_k - I) * C = 1 over GF(2), then the number of solutions C would depend on the rank of the matrix (P_k - I). Each solution would correspond to a valid coloring that satisfies the condition for rotation k.

But in our case, we're interested in colorings where there exists at least one k such that this equation holds. So, the total number of such colorings is the union over all k of the solutions for each k. But to compute this, we need to consider inclusion-exclusion because colorings might satisfy the condition for multiple k's.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can proceed step by step.

First, let's note that the rotations correspond to k = 0, 1, ..., 7, where k=0 is the identity rotation (no rotation). For each k, we can find the number of colorings C such that P_k * C = 1 + C.

But when k=0, P_0 is the identity matrix, so the equation becomes C = 1 + C, which implies 0 = 1, which is impossible. So, for k=0, there are no such colorings.

For other k, let's consider k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Let's see for each k, what's the number of solutions C to (P_k - I) * C = 1.

But to find the number of solutions, we need to analyze the matrix (P_k - I). Each such matrix is an 8x8 matrix over GF(2), where each row corresponds to a permutation.

Wait, but perhaps there's a pattern or symmetry we can exploit. The permutation P_k is a cyclic shift by k positions. So, for example, if k=1, P1 shifts each vertex to the next one. The matrix P1 would have 1s on the superdiagonal and a 1 in the bottom-left corner.

Similarly, for other k, P_k is a permutation matrix corresponding to a cyclic shift by k.

So, let's consider the system (P_k - I) * C = 1 over GF(2). Each equation in this system corresponds to C_{i} = C_{i + k} + 1 mod 2, where the indices are taken modulo 8.

Wait, because P_k shifts each vertex by k, so the equation for each vertex i would be C_i = C_{i + k} + 1 mod 2.

But wait, actually, when you multiply P_k by C, each component is C_{i - k mod 8}. So, the equation would be C_{i - k} = C_i + 1 mod 2. Hmm, maybe I should
