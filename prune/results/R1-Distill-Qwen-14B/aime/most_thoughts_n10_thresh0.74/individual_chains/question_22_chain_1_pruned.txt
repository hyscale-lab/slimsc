Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the opposite sides are parallel, and there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let's recall what a convex equilateral hexagon is. It's a six-sided polygon where all sides are equal in length, and all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, the problem states that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's an important property because it tells me the hexagon is not just equilateral but also has some symmetry in its sides.

Since opposite sides are parallel, this hexagon is what's called a "parallelogon." In the case of a hexagon, this usually means it's a special kind of hexagon, maybe similar to a regular hexagon but with sides equal and opposite sides parallel but not necessarily all angles equal. But wait, a regular hexagon is both equilateral and equiangular, but in this case, the hexagon could have varying angles as long as opposite sides are parallel.

Now, the problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. Let me visualize this. If I have a hexagon ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA as sides. Extending AB, CD, and EF, these lines will meet to form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300.

I think the key here is to relate the triangle's sides to the hexagon's sides. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, say each side has length 's'. The triangle is formed by the extensions of three non-consecutive sides. Hmm, so the sides AB, CD, EF are being extended to form this triangle.

I remember something about similar triangles and parallelograms in such configurations. Maybe there's a way to model this with similar triangles or using coordinate geometry. Alternatively, maybe using vectors or the concept of similar figures.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of similar triangles where the sides of the big triangle are proportional to the sides of smaller triangles formed by the sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, each side is equal in length and direction (but direction is more about vectors, which I might not need here).

Wait, maybe it's about homothety. Homothety is a transformation that enlarges or reduces a figure by a scale factor. If the triangle formed by the extensions is a homothety image of the hexagon or vice versa, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think in terms of coordinate geometry. Let's assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and see if I can model the extensions to form the triangle.

Let me denote the hexagon as ABCDEF, with each side length 's'. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, if I'm going to assign coordinates, maybe placing the hexagon in a coordinate system where point A is at the origin,
