Okay, so I need to solve this logarithm problem where both x and y are greater than 1. The problem says that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So I can rewrite both equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a), so this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. But wait, log_x(y) is the exponent to which I have to raise x to get y. Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to simplify things. Let's say log_x(y) = k. Then, according to this, x^k = y. 

So, going back to the first equation, x * k = 10. Therefore, k = 10/x. But since k is log_x(y), that means log_x(y) = 10/x. Which can also be written as y = x^{10/x}.

Alright, so I have an expression for y in terms of x. Now, let me look at the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, let me denote log_y(x) as m. So, m = log_y(x), which implies y^m = x. From the first part, I know that y = x^{10/x}, so substituting that into y^m = x:

(x^{10/x})^m = x. Simplify the left side: x^{(10/x)*m} = x^1. Since the bases are the same and x > 1, the exponents must be equal. So, (10/x)*m = 1. Therefore, m = x/10.

But m is log_y(x), so log_y(x) = x/10. Let me write that as log_y(x) = x/10.

Now, from earlier, I have log_x(y) = 10/x and log_y(x) = x/10. Wait a second, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_b(a) = 1/(log_a(b)). So, if log_x(y) = 10/x, then log_y(x) should be x/10. Which matches what I found earlier. So that's consistent. That's a good sign.

Now, I have y = x^{10/x} from the first equation. Let's substitute this into the second equation's expression. The second equation in terms of x and y is 4y * log_y(x) = 10. We know that log_y(x) is x/10, so substituting:

4y * (x/10) = 10.

But y = x^{10/x}, so substitute that in:

4 * x^{10/x} * (x / 10) = 10.

Simplify this equation. Let's write it as:

(4x / 10) * x^{10/x} = 10.

Simplify 4/10 to 2/5:

(2x / 5) * x^{10/x} = 10.

Multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate the exponential term:

x * x^{10/x} = (10 * 5/2) = 25.

So, x * x^{10/x} = 25. Let me write x as x^{1}, so x^{1 + 10/x} = 25.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me take natural logarithms on both sides to bring down the exponent. Let's denote t = x, so the equation becomes t^{1 + 10/t} = 25.

Take ln of both sides:

(1 + 10/t) * ln(t) = ln(25).

So, (1 + 10/t) * ln(t) = ln(25).

Hmm, solving for t here seems complicated because it's in both the exponent and multiplied by another term. Maybe I can let u = ln(t), so t = e^u. Let's try substituting that.

So, (1 + 10/(e^u)) * u = ln(25). Simplify 10/(e^u) as 10 e^{-u}:

(1 + 10 e^{-u}) * u = ln(25).

Multiply through:

u + 10 u e^{-u} = ln(25).

This looks like a transcendental equation. Maybe I can try to find a solution by inspection or assume a value for u.

Wait, perhaps there's a better approach. Let's think back. Maybe instead of substituting, I can find a substitution that will make the equation easier.

Wait, let me also consider that 25 is 5 squared, so ln(25) is 2 ln(5). So, I can write:

(1 + 10/x) * ln(x) = 2 ln(5).

Hmm, maybe I can let t = x, so the equation is (1 + 10/t) ln t = 2 ln 5.

Is there a substitution that can help here? Let me think.
