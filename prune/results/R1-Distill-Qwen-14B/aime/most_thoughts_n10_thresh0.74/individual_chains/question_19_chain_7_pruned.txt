Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down. First, let's recall some concepts.

The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle, which is given as 13, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle, given as 6.

The key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O.

I think I'll need to draw a diagram to visualize this. Even though I can't draw it here, I can try to imagine triangle ABC with O and I somewhere inside it.

Let me recall some formulas and properties related to triangle centers.

First, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, OI, can be calculated using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Wait, does that formula hold for all triangles? I think it's called the formula by Euler, so yes, Euler's formula. So, let me compute OI first.

Given R = 13 and r = 6,

OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13.

So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, that's interesting. So the distance between O and I is sqrt(13).

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular.

Alternatively, in terms of coordinates, if I place the triangle in a coordinate system, I can set up some vectors.

But maybe using coordinate geometry might complicate things. Let me think if there's another approach.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the inradius is r = 6, and the distance from I to A is IA. Also, OI is sqrt(13).

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can relate this using the Pythagorean theorem somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps using vector methods or coordinate systems.

Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system such that point I is at the origin. That might simplify things because then the coordinates of I would be (0,0). Then, the circumcenter O would be at some point (h, k), and since OI is sqrt(13), the distance from I (origin) to O is sqrt(h² + k²) = sqrt(13).

Also, the inradius is 6, so the inradius is the distance from I to any side of the triangle.

But the point A is a vertex of the triangle, and IA is the distance from I to A. Wait, IA isn't the inradius, though. The
