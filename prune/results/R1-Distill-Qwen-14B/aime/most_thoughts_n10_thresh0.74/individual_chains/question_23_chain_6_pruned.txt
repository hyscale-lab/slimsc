Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The hyperbola equation is (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with its diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. That sounds like finding the supremum of BD².

First, I recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, no, correction: actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square they are. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, no, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check. No, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint.
