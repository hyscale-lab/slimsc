Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron ABCD, and the edges are given in a symmetric way. Let me write down the given information:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

And the problem says there's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which is given in a specific form: m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then compute m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from this incenter to each face is called the inradius.

To find the inradius, I think the formula is similar to the 2D case. In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In 3D, for a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume V divided by the surface area S. So the formula is r = 3V / S.

So I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.

But wait, how do I compute the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edges? It's a bit tricky. Maybe I can use coordinates.

Yes, setting up coordinates for the tetrahedron might help. Let me pick a coordinate system where some points are easy to define.

Let me assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that calculations are manageable.

Since the edge lengths are symmetric, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral or something. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.

Wait, another thought: in such a tetrahedron, where opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron. I remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, and the tetrahedron has an insphere (which is this point I we're talking about). Also, such a tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box, with each vertex at a corner of the box, and the edges of the tetrahedron correspond to face diagonals of the box.

Oh, that's a useful property. So maybe I can model this tetrahedron as one formed by connecting opposite corners of a rectangular box.

Let me recall that in such a case, if the box has side lengths a, b, c, then the edge lengths of the tetrahedron are sqrt(a² + b²), sqrt(a² + c²), sqrt(b² + c²), each appearing twice as opposite edges.

Looking at the given edge lengths:

AB = CD = sqrt(41) --> so sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80) --> sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89) --> sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89)

So we have the following system of equations:

a² + b² = 41
a² + c² = 80
b² + c² = 89

Hmm, okay, so I can solve for a², b², c².

Let me denote x = a², y = b², z = c².

Then:

x + y = 41
x + z = 80
y + z = 89

Now, let's solve this system.

First, subtract the first equation from the second:

(x + z) - (x + y) = 80 - 41 --> z - y = 39

From the third equation, y + z = 89.

So now, we have:

z - y = 39
z + y = 89

Adding these two equations: 2z = 128 --> z = 64

Substituting back into z - y = 39: 64 - y = 39 --> y = 25

Then from x + y = 41: x = 41 - y = 41 - 25 = 16

So, a² = 16 --> a = 4

b² = 25 --> b = 5

c² = 64 --> c = 8

So the box has sides 4, 5, 8.

Cool, so the tetrahedron can be embedded in a box with sides 4, 5, 8, and the tetrahedron's vertices are at opposite corners of the box.

Now, knowing that, perhaps the volume of the tetrahedron can be found using the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron inscribed in a box: V = (a*b*c)/3.

Wait, is that correct? So for a box with sides a, b, c, the volume of the tetrahedron formed by connecting opposite corners is indeed (a*b*c)/3.

Let me verify. The box has volume a*b*c, and the tetrahedron divides the box into 6 equal parts, so each part has volume (a*b*c)/6. So the tetrahedron would have 4 such parts? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, actually, when you connect two opposite corners of a box, you split the box into six tetrahedrons, each with equal volume. So each of those small tetrahedrons has volume (a*b*c)/6. But the tetrahedron we're considering is made of four of them? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing. Let me think again. The tetrahedron formed by four vertices of the box, where each pair of opposite edges are equal, that is, the tetrahedron has vertices at (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c). The volume of that is |(a b c)| / 6. But in our case, the tetrahedron is the one connecting (0,0,0), (a,b,c), (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c)? No, wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I should reconsider. Alternatively, perhaps the volume of the tetrahedron is (a*b*c)/3. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the volume can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Since I have all the edge lengths, perhaps that's a better approach.

But since I know the box dimensions, let's try to compute the volume.

Wait, the box has sides 4, 5, 8. The tetrahedron is formed by four vertices of the box. For example, let's define the vertices as follows:

Let me set the origin at (0,0,0). Then, the other vertices connected by the edges would be at (4,0,0), (0,5,0), (0,
