Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of AP in triangle ABC. The triangle is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. So, ABC is a triangle with sides 5, 9, 10. Since the sides are all different, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC, so all three vertices lie on ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet has some properties related to the circle. Specifically, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, no, actually, D is the ex-pole with respect to BC, but I might be mixing terms.

Wait, another thought: the tangent at B and tangent at C meet at D, so D is the exsimilicenter of the circle ω with respect to BC. Or maybe it's the external homothety center. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should recall that the tangent from a point to a circle is equal in length. So, DB and DC are tangent to ω, so DB = DC, right? Because tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length.

So, DB = DC. That means triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC. Interesting. So, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. But BC is 9 units long. Wait, let me think about the position of D. Since the tangents from D touch ω at B and C, D is outside the circle, and line AD passes through the circle again at P.

I think I need to find the coordinates or something. Maybe coordinate geometry would help here. Alternatively, perhaps using power of a point or inversion properties.

Wait, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA, since D lies outside the circle and DA is a secant intersecting the circle at A and P. So, that's the power of D with respect to ω.

So, power of D: DB² = DP * DA.

I know that DA = DP + PA, but wait, actually, DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DA = DP + PA, but wait, is P between D and A? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, since we're dealing with a circle, and AD is a line starting at A and going through D, which is outside the circle, so the intersection points are A and P. So, actually, AP is from A to P, which is on the circle, and then from P to D is the extension beyond the circle. So, the Power of D is DP * DA = DB
