Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help me here.

First, let's write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I need to find xy. Maybe I can express both equations in terms of natural logarithms or common logarithms to make them easier to handle. I remember that log_b(a) = (ln a)/(ln b), so maybe that can help.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a), I can rewrite this as:

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same power rule:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now we have:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because log_b(a) = 1/(log_a(b)). So, if I let log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k.

Let me set that up. Let’s let k = log_x(y). Then log_y(x) = 1/k.

Substituting into the equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. 4y * (1/k) = 10

So now I have two equations:

Equation 1: x * k = 10 → x = 10 / k

Equation 2: (4y) / k = 10 → 4y = 10k → y = (10k) / 4 = (5k)/2

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k. Maybe I can substitute back into one of the original logarithmic equations to solve for k.

Wait, but I already used the logarithmic properties to get x and y in terms of k. Maybe I can relate x and y through another equation? Let me see.

From the definition of k: k = log_x(y). Using the change of base formula, that's (ln y) / (ln x) = k.

So, ln y = k * ln x.

But since x = 10/k, let's plug that in.

ln y = k * ln(10/k) = k * [ln 10 - ln k]

I also have y expressed in terms of k: y = (5k)/2.

So, substituting that into the equation:

ln(5k/2) = k [ln 10 - ln k]

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me expand the right side.

Right side: k ln 10 - k ln k

Left side: ln(5k/2) = ln 5 + ln k - ln 2

So putting it together:

ln 5 + ln k - ln 2 = k ln 10 - k ln k

Hmm, that's an equation involving ln terms and k. It might not be straightforward to solve algebraically. Maybe I can rearrange terms to see if something simplifies.

Let me collect like terms:

ln 5 - ln 2 + ln k = k ln 10 - k ln k

Bring all terms to one side:

ln 5 - ln 2 + ln k - k ln 10 + k ln k = 0

This seems messy. Maybe I can factor some parts. Let's see:

= (ln 5 - ln 2) + ln k (1 + k) - k ln 10 = 0

I don't immediately see an easy way to solve this analytically. Maybe I can make a substitution or think about possible integer values of k that might satisfy the equation.

Wait, maybe k is an integer? Let's test some integer values for k.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter substitution or another approach I can take.

Wait, let's step back. I have x and y expressed in terms of k:

x = 10/k

y = 5k/2

So, the product xy would be (10/k) * (5k/2) = (10 * 5k) / (2k) = (50k)/(2k) = 25. Wait, so does that mean xy is 25?

Wait, hold on, does that make sense? Because when I multiply x and y, the k cancels out. So, regardless of the value of k, xy is 25? That seems too easy, but maybe that's correct.

Let me double-check that.

x = 10/k

y = 5k/2

So, xy = (10/k) * (5k/2) = (10 * 5k) / (2k) = (50k)/(2k) = 25.

So, that's interesting. It seems that regardless of k, xy is 25. So, is the answer 25?

But wait, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake. Because earlier I attempted to substitute and found a complicated equation, but if xy is 25 regardless of k, then maybe the answer is indeed 25.

But let me think again. Because x and y have to satisfy both the original logarithmic equations, so perhaps the product is fixed at 25, even though individual x and y might vary.

Wait, but in reality, x and y are uniquely determined by k, but the product is fixed. So, regardless of the value of k, as long as the equations are satisfied, xy is 25.

Wait, but let me verify that with the original equations.

If I take x = 10/k and y = 5k/2, then let's plug into the first original equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Compute y^x: (5k/2)^{1
