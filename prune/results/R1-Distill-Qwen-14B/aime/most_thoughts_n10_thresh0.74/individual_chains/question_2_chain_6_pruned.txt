Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis from O to (1,0), and B is up the y-axis a bit, specifically at (0, sqrt(3)/2). 

Then there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, these are like line segments that go from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. Since they're in the first quadrant, both P and Q are in the positive axes.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from family F except for AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because A is on the x-axis, B is on the y-axis, and the distance between A and B is... let me check: the distance between (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2) would be sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is a segment in F with length 1.

Now, point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and the special property is that it's not on any other segment from F. So, unlike every other point on AB, C isn't lying on any of these other PQ segments. So, we need to find point C on AB such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ in F except AB.

Once we have point C, we need to compute OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, OC² is equal to p/q, where p and q are coprime positive integers, and then we need to find p + q.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's parametrize AB. Since AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), we can write parametric equations for AB. Let me recall that the parametric form can be given by:

C(t) = A + t*(B - A), where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So, B - A is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, C(t) = (1/2, 0) + t*(-1/2, sqrt(3)/2) = (1/2 - t/2, sqrt(3)*t/2).

So, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - t/2, sqrt(3)*t/2), where t is between 0 and 1. When t=0, we get A, and t=1, we get B.

So, point C is (x, y) = (1/2 - t/2, sqrt(3)*t/2). So, x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3) t)/2.

Now, the problem is to find t in (0,1) such that C(t) is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, for that, we need to find t where C(t) is not on any other PQ in F.

So, to find such a t, we need to ensure that for any other P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, with PQ of length 1, C(t) is not on PQ.

So, for point C(t) to lie on another PQ, the line PQ must pass through C(t). Therefore, to find C(t) that doesn't lie on any other PQ, we need to ensure that for no other P and Q, the line PQ passes through C(t).

But how do we find such a C(t)?

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the envelope of all these segments PQ in F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each PQ at some point. So, the points on the envelope are the ones that lie on the boundary of the region covered by the segments. So, point C(t) is on the envelope, meaning that it's only on AB and nowhere else.

Wait, but AB is one of these segments, so if C is on AB and on the envelope, then perhaps it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that, but let's think more.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the family of lines PQ. Each PQ has P on the x-axis at (p, 0) and Q on the y-axis at (0, q), with the distance between P and Q being 1. So, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p² + q² = 1.

So, each line PQ can be represented as x/p + y/q = 1. That's the equation of the line with intercepts p and q.

So, since p² + q² = 1, the equation of each line is x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² = 1.

So, the family of lines is x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1.

Now, our point C(t) is ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ). We need to find t such that for any p and q with p² + q² = 1, the point C(t) doesn't lie on x/p + y/q = 1, except when (p, q) corresponds to A and B.

Wait, but A is (1/2, 0), so in that case, p = 1/2, q would be sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(3)/2. So, the line AB is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1, which is 2x + (2y)/sqrt(3) = 1.

Which is exactly the line AB.

So, for the point C(t) to not lie on any other PQ, the system of equations x/p + y/q = 1 and p² + q² = 1 should have no solution (p, q) other than p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.

So, for point C(t) = (x, y) = ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ), we can plug into the line equation x/p + y/q = 1:

[(1 - t)/2]/p + [ (sqrt(3) t)/2 ] / q = 1.

But since p² + q² = 1, we can write this as:

( (1 - t)/(2p) ) + ( sqrt(3) t / (2 q) ) = 1.

Let me denote this as equation (1):

(1 - t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 q) = 1.

But since p² + q² = 1, let me express this as equation (2):

p² + q² = 1.

So, now we have two equations: (1) and (2). We need to find p and q such that both equations are satisfied. But we want that, except for p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, there are no other solutions.

Therefore, to ensure that C(t) is not on any other PQ, the system (1) and (2) must have exactly one solution (p, q) which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, for that, the system must be such that for our specific x and y (i.e., (1 - t)/2 and (sqrt(3) t)/2 ), the only solution is p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, if there are other solutions (p, q), then C(t) would lie on another PQ, which we don't want. So, we need to find t such that the system has only one solution.

To find when the system has only one solution, probably we can solve for p and q in terms of t and find the condition when the system has exactly one solution.

So, let's write equation (1):

(1 - t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 q) = 1.

Multiply both sides by 2 p q to eliminate denominators:

(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p = 2 p q.

Equation (2): p² + q² = 1.

So, now we have:

(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p = 2 p q.  --> equation (3)

And p² + q² = 1. --> equation (2)

So, our goal is to find t such that equations (3) and (2) have exactly one solution (p, q), which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

If for some t, the system has more than one solution, then point C(t) lies on multiple PQs, which we don't want. So, we need the system to have exactly one solution, which is the PQ AB.

So, to find such t, we can treat equations (3) and (2) as a system in variables p and q, and find when this system has exactly one solution.

Let me try to solve equation (3) for one variable and substitute into equation (2).

From equation (3):

(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p = 2 p q.

Let me rearrange this:

(1 - t) q = 2 p q - sqrt(3) t p.

Factor q on the right side:

(1 - t) q = p q (2) - sqrt(3) t p.

Bring all terms to one side:

(1 - t) q - 2 p q + sqrt(3) t p = 0.

Factor:

q (1 - t - 2 p) + sqrt(3) t p = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's solve for q in terms of p.

Starting again from equation (3):

(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p = 2 p q.

Bring terms with q to one side:

(1 - t) q - 2 p q = - sqrt(3) t p.

Factor q:

q (1 - t - 2 p) = - sqrt(3) t p.

So,

q = [ - sqrt(3) t p ] / (1 - t - 2 p ).

Alternatively, simplifying:

q = [ sqrt(3) t p ] / (t + 2 p - 1).

Wait, I multiplied numerator and denominator by -1.

So,

q = [ sqrt(3) t p ] / (2 p + t - 1).

So, q is expressed in terms of p.

Now, substitute this into equation (2):

p² + q² = 1.

So,

p² + [ ( sqrt(3) t p ) / (2 p + t - 1) ]² = 1.

Let me write that as:

p² + [ 3 t² p² ] / (2 p + t - 1)^2 = 1.

Let me denote the denominator as D = (2 p + t -1)^2.

So,

p² + (3 t² p²) / D = 1.

Factor p²:

p² [ 1 + (3 t²)/D ] = 1.

But D = (2 p + t -1)^2.

So,

p² [ 1 + 3 t² / (2 p + t -1)^2 ] = 1.

This looks messy, but perhaps we can find a way to express it.

Let me write u = 2 p + t -1.

Then, D = u².

So, 2 p = u - t +1.

So, p = (u - t +1)/2.

Substitute p into the equation.

Wait, maybe that substitution won't help. Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying.

Let me take the equation:

p² + [3 t² p²]/(2 p + t -1)^2 = 1.

Multiply both sides by (2 p + t -1)^2:

p² (2 p + t -1)^2 + 3 t² p² = (2 p + t -1)^2.
