Okay, so I've got this math problem here about filling a 2x3 grid with digits. The goal is to find the number of ways to place digits such that two conditions are satisfied. First, when you read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. Second, when you read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. 

Hmm, let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Each cell will have a single digit. Let me denote the grid like this:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, reading left to right, the first row is the number abc, and the second row is def. So the sum of abc and def should be 999. 

On the other hand, reading top to bottom, each column forms a number. So the first column is ad, the second is be, and the third is cf. So the sum of ad, be, and cf should be 99.

Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the grid correctly. When reading top to bottom, each column has two digits, right? So for the first column, it's ad, which is a two-digit number. Similarly, be and cf. So the sum ad + be + cf = 99.

Got it. So we have two equations here.

First equation: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Second equation: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Our variables are a, b, c, d, e, f, each being digits from 0 to 9. But wait, a and d can't be zero? Well, actually, in the given example, a is 0. Hmm, but let's see. If a is zero, then the first number, abc, is a two-digit number, but the way it's written, it's 0bc, which is actually just bc as a number, right? Similarly, def is a three-digit number. So 0bc + def = 999. That's okay, because 0bc is a two-digit or one-digit number. But when you add it to def, which is three digits, the sum is 999, which is three digits.

Wait, but 0bc is actually a two-digit number because a is zero. So, for example, if a is zero, then the first number is 00c, which is just c. But that's maybe not the case. Wait, no, the way numbers are formed, the first row is read as a three-digit number: 100a + 10b + c. So if a is zero, it's just 10b + c. So, for example, if a is zero, b is 9, c is 9, then the first number is 099, which is 99, and the second number is def, which is say, 900, then the sum would be 99 + 900 = 999. That works.

So, I think all digits can be 0-9, including a, d, etc., unless the problem specifies otherwise. Since the example has a=0 and d=9, which is allowed, so I think all digits can be 0-9.

So our two equations are:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

I should probably rewrite these equations to make them easier to handle.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see if that helps.

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99

Calculating the left side:

100a - 10a = 90a

10b
