Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe I can use that somewhere. Let me think about the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. I wonder if that can be rewritten in a more manageable form.

Let me try to factor or simplify that expression. Let's see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm. Maybe I can factor out a 2 from the first two terms? That would give me 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k, so the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x².

So, the expression is x² - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k. That's a quadratic equation. I wonder if it factors. Let's check the discriminant: D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are complex. Hmm. Maybe I can factor it as (x - a)(x - b), but since the discriminant is negative, a and b are complex conjugates. Not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, but I'm supposed to take the product of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. So, that's the same as the product over k of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Which is the same as the product over k of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Hmm.

Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12. So, for each k, ω^k is a root of the equation x^13 = 1. Also, since ω ≠ 1, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity.

Now, the product we're looking at is the product over all 13th roots of unity (except maybe 1, but in the problem statement, ω ≠ 1, but the product includes k=0, which would give ω^0 = 1. Wait, so when k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, the k=0 term is just 1, so maybe I can just consider the product from k=1 to 12.

But perhaps it's easier to include k=0 and then think of the product as the product over all k=0 to 12, which is the same as the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2x + x^2), where x is each root.

Now, if I have a polynomial P(x) = product over all roots x of (2 - 2x + x^2), then that product would be the resultant of evaluating the polynomial Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 at each root of x^13 = 1.

Wait, no, actually, the product of Q(ω^k) for k=0 to 12 would be equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of Q(ω^k). Since Q(x) is a quadratic, maybe I can relate this to some polynomial.

I remember that the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x), which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, because Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive nth roots of unity. But in this case, since 13 is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive.

Wait, but I'm taking the product of Q(ω^k) for k=0 to 12. That's the same as evaluating the resultant of Q(x) over all roots of x^13 - 1 = 0. I think there's a formula for that.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - ω^k) is equal to Φ_13(a) when a ≠ 1, but I'm not sure if that applies here because Q(x) is not a linear term.

Wait, perhaps I should consider evaluating the product over k=0 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k. Wait, no, it's (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), which is the same as (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me rearrange that: ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.
