Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I need to find all possible triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are nonnegative integers satisfying these two equations. 

I remember that sometimes in problems involving symmetric expressions, it's helpful to manipulate the equations to find a more manageable form. Maybe I can factor the second equation or express it in terms of the first equation somehow.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that this can be factored by grouping terms. Let me try that.

Group the terms as follows:

(a²b + a²c) + (b²a + b²c) + (c²a + c²b)

Factor each group:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that looks better. Now, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), since a + b + c = 300. Similarly, (a + c) is (300 - b) and (a + b) is (300 - c).

So, substituting these into the equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that down:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Now, that's a bit simpler. Let me denote each term as a function of a single variable. For example, for variable a, it's a²(300 - a). Similarly for b and c.

So, the equation becomes:

f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000, where f(x) = x²(300 - x).

Interesting. So each of a, b, c contributes f(a), f(b), f(c) respectively, and their sum is 6,000,000.

I also know that a + b + c = 300, so perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the others, but I'm not sure yet. Maybe I can find possible values for a, b, c that satisfy both equations.

Let me think about the function f(x) = x²(300 - x). Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, x can range from 0 to 300. Let's see what the maximum of f(x) is. Taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:

f'(x) = 2x(300 - x) + x²(-1) = 600x - 2x² - x² = 600x - 3x².

Setting f'(x) = 0:

600x - 3x² = 0 → x(600 - 3x) = 0 → x=0 or 600 - 3x = 0 → x=200.

So, the maximum of f(x) occurs at x=200. Let's compute f(200):

f(200) = 200²(300 - 200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000.

So each f(x) can be at most 4,000,000 when x=200, and since a, b, c are each ≤300, their f(x) values are ≤4,000,000.

Wait, but the sum f(a) + f(b) + f(c) is 6,000,000. So, each of them can't be too big. Let me think about possible values.

If all three variables were 200, then the sum would be 3*4,000,000 = 12,000,000, which is way too big. So, that can't be the case.

Alternatively, if one variable is 200, let's see:

Suppose a=200. Then f(a)=4,000,000. Then f(b) + f(c) = 2,000,000. But since b + c = 100, because a + b + c=300, and a=200.

So, if a=200, then b + c=100, and f(b) + f(c)=2,000,000. Let's see what f(b) + f(c) would be when b + c=100.

Let me denote b as x, then c=100 - x. So, f(x) + f(100 - x) = x²(300 - x) + (100 - x)²(300 - (100 - x)).

Simplify the second term: (100 - x)²(200 + x).

So, f(x) + f(100 - x) = x²(300 - x) + (100 - x)²(200 + x).

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can compute f(x) + f(100 - x) for some specific x values to see if it's equal to 2,000,000.

Wait, but since a=200, and the sum f(b) + f(c) is 2,000,000, maybe I can find if there's a solution where both b and c are 50, because 50 +50=100.

Let me check f(50) + f(50). f(50)=50²*(300 -50)=2500*250=625,000. So 625,000 +625,000=1,250,000, which is less than 2,000,000. Hmm, that's not enough.

Wait, perhaps one of them is higher. Let me suppose that b=100 and c=0. Then f(b)=100²*(300 -100)=10,000*200=2,000,000. f(c)=0²*300=0. So, f(b)+f(c)=2,000,000. That's exactly the amount we need.

So, if a=200, then b=100 and c=0, or any permutation of that.

So, in this case, the triples would be (200,100,0) and all permutations. How many permutations are there?

Since the numbers are 200, 100, 0, which are all distinct. The number of permutations is 3! =6.

But wait, are all permutations valid? Let me see. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, yes, any permutation is allowed as long as they satisfy a + b + c=300. So, in this case, each permutation would give a different triple, so 6 possibilities.

So that's one set of solutions.

But are there other solutions where a, b, c are not 200,100,0 in some order?

Hmm, let's see. Maybe more than one variable can be 200.

Wait, but if two variables are 200, say a
