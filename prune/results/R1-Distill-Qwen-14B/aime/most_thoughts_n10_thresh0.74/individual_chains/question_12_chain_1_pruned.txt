Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It involves a 2x3 grid, and I need to figure out how many ways I can place digits (0-9) in each cell such that two conditions are met. First, when I read the grid left to right on the top row, that forms a number, and similarly for the bottom row, their sum should be 999. Second, when I read the grid top to bottom for each column, those form three numbers, and their sum should be 99. 

Hmm, the example given is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

Which works because 008 + 991 = 999, and 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Wait, actually, let me check that. 008 is just 8, 991 is 991, adding them gives 8 + 991 = 999. For the columns, 0 and 9 make 09, which is 9, then 0 and 9 make 09, which is 9, and 8 and 1 make 81. Adding 9 + 9 + 81 gives 99. So that's correct.

So, the grid has two rows and three columns. Let's denote the cells as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the top row is abc, which is a three-digit number, and the bottom row is def, another three-digit number. Their sum is 999.

Also, each column is ad, be, cf. So each is a two-digit number, and their sum is 99.

So, to rephrase:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Wait, that's correct? Because each column is a two-digit number formed by the top digit and the bottom digit. So first column is 10a + d, second is 10b + e, third is 10c + f. And those three add up to 99.

So, equation 1: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

Equation 2: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

I need to find the number of possible assignments of a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9) that satisfy both equations.

Let me see if I can express these equations differently. Maybe I can find a relationship between them.

Let me denote the top number as N = 100a + 10b + c and the bottom number as M = 100d + 10e + f. Then equation 1 is N + M = 999.

Equation 2 is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Now, let's compute equation 2:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So equation 2 can be rewritten as 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write down both equations again:

Equation 1: N + M = 999
Equation 2: 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

But also, N = 100a + 10b + c, M = 100d + 10e + f.

So, let's add N and M:

N + M = 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Which can be written as 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Wait, but 999 is a three-digit number. So, 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Wait, 999 is 9*100 + 9*10 + 9, so that suggests that:

a + d = 9

b + e = 9

c + f = 9

Wait, is that right? Because 100*(a + d) + 10*(b + e) + (c + f) = 999. So, each of the coefficients must add up to 999's digits.

But wait, 100*(a + d) would have to be 900, so a + d = 9.

Similarly, 10*(b + e) would be 90, so b + e =9.

And c + f =9, since the units digit is 9.

So, from equation 1, we get:

a + d =9

b + e =9

c + f =9

Now, equation 2 is 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

Let me express d, e, f in terms of a, b, c.

From a + d =9, d =9 -a

From b + e =9, e=9 -b

From c + f =9, f=9 -c

So, substituting into equation 2:

10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 10*(a + b + c) + (9 - a + 9 - b + 9 - c) = 10*(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) = 99

Let me compute that:

Let S = a + b + c.

Then equation 2 becomes 10*S + (27 - S) = 99

Which simplifies to 10S +27 - S = 99

So, 9S +27 =99

Subtract 27 from both sides: 9S=72

Divide both sides by 9: S=8

So, S = a + b + c =8

So, now I know that a + b + c =8, and from the first equation, a + d=9, b + e=9, c + f=9, so d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c.

So, all variables are determined once a, b, c are fixed, provided that a + b + c =8.

So, now, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions (a,b,c) with each variable between 0 and 9 inclusive, such that a + b + c=8.

But wait, each of a, b, c are digits, so they can be 0 to 9. Since 8 is less than 9, each variable can take any value from 0 to 8, as long as their sum is 8.

So, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where each variable is between 0 and 8 (since 8 is less than 9, the upper limit doesn't restrict anything beyond a + b + c =8).

The number of such solutions
