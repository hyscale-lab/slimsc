Okay, so I have this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" integers. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says that for an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals sqrt(81) which is 9. So that makes sense.

The task is to find the least integer b (≥ 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy these conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me break down the problem. 

First, a two-digit number in base b can be written as d1*d2 in base b. So, in decimal, that's d1*b + d2. Here, d1 and d2 are digits in base b, which means d1 can be from 1 to b-1 (since it's the first digit and can't be zero), and d2 can be from 0 to b-1.

So, mathematically, n = d1*b + d2. The condition is that d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). So, substituting n, we get:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 = d1*b + d2

Let me rearrange everything to one side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 - d1*b - d2 = 0

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of d1 and d2. Maybe I can rewrite it to make it more manageable.

Let me group terms with d1 and d2:

d1^2 + (2*d2 - b)*d1 + (d2^2 - d2) = 0

Hmm, perhaps treating this as a quadratic equation in d1 for each d2. So, for fixed d2, we can solve for d1.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider this as a quadratic in d2 as well. But perhaps another approach would be better.

Wait, maybe instead of treating it as a quadratic equation, I can consider the equation:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d1*b + d2)

Let me denote s = d1 + d2. Then, s = sqrt(d1*b + d2), so s^2 = d1*b + d2.

But since s = d1 + d2, I can substitute that into the equation:

s^2 = d1*b + d2

But since d2 = s - d1, substituting that in:

s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)

Which simplifies to:

s^2 = d1*(b - 1) + s

Then, rearranging:

s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)

So,

d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Hmm, since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b-1). Also, d1 must satisfy 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1, and d2 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 ≤ d2 ≤ b-1.

So, this gives us a way to find possible s for each base b.

Let me write down the key equations:

1. s = d1 + d2
2. s^2 = d1*b + d2
3. d2 = s - d1
4. Substituting into equation 2: s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1) ⇒ s^2 = d1*(b - 1) + s ⇒ d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)
5. Also, since d1 must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1)
6. Additionally, d1 must be between 1 and b-1, and d2 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.

So, for each base b, I can iterate over possible s and check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), and then compute d1 and d2, making sure they are valid digits.

But since we're looking for the minimal b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, maybe I can find a way to parameterize s and d1 for each b.

Wait, let's see. For a given b, we can find all s such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1). So, s(s - 1) must be divisible by (b - 1). 

Let me denote k = b - 1. Then, s(s - 1) must be divisible by k. So, for each k, we can find s such that k divides s(s - 1).

Moreover, since d1 = s(s - 1)/k must satisfy 1 ≤ d1 ≤ k (since d1 ≤ b -1 = k). Also, d2 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 ≤ d2 ≤ k.

So, for each b, which is equal to k +1, we can find all s where k divides s(s - 1), and d1 and d2 are within the digit ranges.

So, the problem reduces to, for each k ≥1, finding the number of integers s such that k divides s(s - 1), and 1 ≤ d1 = s(s -1)/k ≤ k, and 0 ≤ d2 = s - d1 ≤ k.

Each such s gives a valid b-eautiful number n = d1*b + d2.

So, our goal is to find the smallest k +1 (i.e., b) where the number of such s exceeds ten.

This seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can think in terms of k. For each k, find the number of s such that k divides s(s-1), and 1 ≤ s(s-1)/k ≤ k, and 0 ≤ s - s(s-1)/k ≤ k.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between s and k.

Wait, let me think about s. Since d2 = s - d1 = s - [s(s -1)/k]

So, d2 = s - [s^2 - s]/k = [k*s - s^2 + s]/k = [ -s^2 + (k +1)s ] /k

Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think differently.

For each b, which is k +1, we can find the number of s where:

1. s(s -1) is divisible by k.

2. d1 = s(s -1)/k is between 1 and k.

3. d2 = s - d1 is between 0 and k.

Each triplet (s, d1, d2) corresponds to a valid n, so each s gives a unique n.

So, for each k, the number of s that satisfy these conditions is the number of b-eautiful numbers for that base.

Therefore, to find the minimal b where the count exceeds ten, we need to find the smallest k +1 such that the number of s satisfying the above conditions is greater than ten.

So, perhaps I can model this as for each k, find how many s satisfy:

- k divides s(s -1)
- d1 = s(s -1)/k is in [1, k]
- d2 = s - d1 is in [0, k]

Let me see for a given k, what possible s can be. Since k divides s(s-1), s must be such that s ≡ 0 or 1 mod some factors of k. But perhaps another approach is to note that s(s -1) must be a multiple of k, so s must be such that either s or s-1 is a multiple of a divisor of k.

But maybe a better approach is to express s in terms of k. Let's see:

Given that d1 = s(s-1)/k must be an integer between 1 and k.

So,

1 ≤ s(s-1)/k ≤ k

Which implies,

k ≤ s(s -1) ≤ k^2

So,

k ≤ s^2 - s ≤ k^2

Hmm, considering s as a variable, and k as a parameter.

So, for each k, we can find s such that s^2 - s is between k and k^2.

Moreover, s must be such that s(s -1) is divisible by k.

So, perhaps for each k, we can find all s in a certain range that satisfy s(s-1) divisible by k, and 1 ≤ d1 ≤ k, 0 ≤ d2 ≤ k.

This seems a bit involved, but maybe we can find a way to parameterize s.

Wait, perhaps s must be around sqrt(k) or something? Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since s(s -1) must be a multiple of k, then s ≡ 0 or 1 mod factors of k.

But perhaps a better way is to consider that s and s -1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, k must be factored into two coprime factors, say a and b, such that a divides s and b divides s -1, or vice versa.

Wait, but when k is not 1, it's not necessarily possible for s to satisfy that, but perhaps for each k, we can find pairs (a, b) where a*b = k, gcd(a, b) = 1, and then s ≡ 0 mod a, s ≡ 1 mod b.

But maybe that's getting too in-depth.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model for each k, the number of s is equal to the number of divisors of k.

Wait, not exactly. Because s(s -1) must be a multiple of k, but s and s -1 are coprime. So, the factors of k must be split between s and s -1.

Meaning, for each k, we can write k = a*b, where gcd(a, b) = 1, and then s ≡ 0 mod a, s ≡ 1 mod b.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since a and b are coprime, there is a unique solution modulo a*b.

So, for each k, the number of such s is equal to the number of ways to write k as a product of two coprime integers a and b, and then for each such factorization, we get a solution s modulo k.

But wait, each factorization (a, b) where a*b = k and gcd(a, b) = 1 gives exactly one solution s modulo k. So, the number of solutions s in the range [1, k] would be equal to the number of
