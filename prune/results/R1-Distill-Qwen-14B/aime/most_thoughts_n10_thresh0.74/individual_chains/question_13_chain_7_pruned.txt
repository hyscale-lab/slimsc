Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, we're supposed to find out how many minutes her walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm. So, the key here is that her walking speed affects the time she spends walking, but the time in the coffee shop (t) is the same each time, right? Because whether she walks fast or slow, she still spends t minutes in the coffee shop after each walk.

So, the total time she takes each morning is the walking time plus t minutes. But in both cases given, the total time is provided, so I can set up equations based on that.

Let me write down what I know.

First scenario:
- Speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours, which is 4*60 = 240 minutes.
- This total time includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, the walking time in the first case would be total time minus t. That is, 240 - t minutes.

Wait, but the problem says the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes. So, does that mean the total time is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee shop time? So, the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. Wait, but units are a bit mixed hereâ€”some in hours, some in minutes. I should convert everything to the same units to avoid confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work in hours. Let me think.

First scenario:
- Walking speed = s km/h
- Distance = 9 km
- Time taken walking = distance/speed = 9/s hours
- Total time (walking + coffee) = 4 hours
- So, 9/s + t/60 = 4. Because t is in minutes, so to convert to hours, divide by 60.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let me clarify: the problem says when she walks at speed s, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes at the coffee shop. So, the total time is 4 hours, which is 4 hours, which includes both the walking and the coffee time. So, the time she actually spends walking is 4 hours minus t minutes.

But t is in minutes. So, to make the units consistent, I can convert everything into hours or everything into minutes. Maybe it's easier to convert t into hours. Let's say t is in hours. But no, the problem gives t in minutes, so perhaps I should convert the walking time into minutes.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

For the
