Okay, so I've got this math problem here about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The problem says we need to find the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to understand this step by step.

First, I know that on a grid, moving from the lower left corner to the upper right corner usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, making a total of 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of rights (R) and ups (U) that adds up to 16 steps.

If there were no restrictions on direction changes, the total number of paths would be the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's, which is the binomial coefficient C(16,8). But this problem isn't just about any pathâ€”it's specifically about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, I need to think about how direction changes affect the structure of the path.

Let me recall: a direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. For example, a path that starts with a few R's, then switches to U's, then back to R's, and so on, each switch counts as a direction change. So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, that means it has five segments of consecutive R's or U's. For example, R...R U...U R...R U...U R...R. Each switch is a direction change.

Wait, so each direction change corresponds to a switch between R and U. So, for a path that changes direction four times, the number of segments is five. Each segment is either all R's or all U's. So, the path can be thought of as alternating between R and U segments.

But wait, the starting direction could be either R or U. So, the path could start with R, then U, then R, etc., or it could start with U, then R, then U, etc. So, there are two cases based on the starting direction.

Hmm, okay, so let's model this. Each path can be represented as a sequence of alternating R and U segments. Since the path must end at the upper right corner, which is (8,8), the total number of R steps is 8 and the total number of U steps is 8. So, the sum of all R segments is 8, and the sum of all U segments is 8.

Since the path changes direction four times, the number of segments is five. So, if the path starts with R, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. If it starts with U, the segments would be U, R, U, R, U. So, we have two cases.

Each case will have five segments, with alternations between R and U. Let's pick one case first. Let's suppose the path starts with R. So, the segments are R, U, R, U, R. The number of R segments is three, and the number of U segments is two. Similarly, if it starts with U, the number of U segments is three, and R segments is two.

Wait, no, wait. For each
