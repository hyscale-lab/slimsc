Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product of AB and AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius R = 13. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet and is the center of the inscribed circle with radius r = 6.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That's an interesting condition. I think I might need to use coordinate geometry or vector approaches here, but maybe there's a more straightforward way with synthetic geometry and known formulas.

Wait, maybe I can use Euler's formula, which relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. Euler's formula says that the distance OI is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me compute that. R is 13, r is 6, so OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13).

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. So in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So by Pythagoras theorem, OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2.

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. OI is sqrt(13), so OA^2 = 13^2 = 169. So 169 = (sqrt(13))^2 + IA^2 => 169 = 13 + IA^2. Therefore, IA^2 = 156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Okay, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). Now, I remember that the length of the inradius can be related to the area and semiperimeter. But IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I think there's a formula for the length of the angle bisector from the inradius, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. I recall that IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me check that. Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2).

So IA = r / sin(A/2). We have IA = 2*sqrt(39) and r = 6. Therefore, 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2). Solving for sin(A/2), we get sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, let me check that step again. So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39). Multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(39), we get (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13. That's correct.

So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Now, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = 1. So cos^2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, I know that in triangle ABC, the sides can be related to the angles and the inradius or circumradius. Let me recall the formula for the sides in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. The area of the triangle is r*s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius as (a*b*c)/(4R). So, area = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, equating the two expressions for area: r*s = (a*b*c)/52. Therefore, 6*s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 312*s.

Hmm, but I don't know the semiperimeter s yet. Maybe I can find another relation.

Wait, I'm trying to find AB·AC. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. So, the sides are a, b, c opposite angles A, B, C respectively.

We need to find b*c. Let me see if I can find expressions for b and c.

Alternatively, maybe I can find angle A using the information we have. Since we have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), perhaps we can find angle A.

Let me compute angle A. Since sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, then A/2 = arcsin(sqrt(39)/13). Let me find the numerical value, but maybe I can find cos A using double-angle formulas.

We know that cos A = 1 - 2 sin^2(A/2). Wait, wait, no, actually cos A = 1 - 2 sin^2(A/2), which is correct because cos A = cos(2*(A/2)) = 1 - 2 sin^2(A/2).

So, sin^2(A/2) = 39/169, so 2 sin^2(A/2) = 78/169. Therefore, cos A = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / (13*13) )= 7/13.

Wait, 91 divided by 13 is 7, yes. So cos A = 7/13. Therefore, angle A has cosine 7/13.

Now, in triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines, we can write:

a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A.

But I don't know a, so maybe that's not helpful yet.

Wait, but maybe I can find another relation involving bc. Let's think about areas and other formulas.

We know that area = 6*s. Also, area can be written as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

So, 6*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A => 12*s = b*c*sin A.

Hmm, so if I can find sin A and relate it to s, maybe I can find bc.

We know cos A = 7/13, so sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt( (169 - 49)/169 ) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.

Therefore, sin A = (2*sqrt(30))/13.

Plugging back into the area expression: 12*s = b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) => 12*s = (2*sqrt(30)/13) * b*c.

We can write this as: b*c = (12*s * 13) / (2*sqrt(30)) ) = (156 s) / (2*sqrt(30)) ) = (78 s) / sqrt(30).

Hmm, so bc = (78 s) / sqrt(30). Let me keep that in mind.

Earlier, we had from the area = r*s = (a*b*c)/(4R). So, 6*s = (a*b*c)/(52) => a*b*c = 312*s.

But I don't know a, so maybe that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relation using the fact that AI = 2*sqrt(39).

Wait, AI is the distance from the inradius to vertex A, which we found to be 2*sqrt(39). And we also have that AI = r / sin(A/2), which we already used. Maybe I need another formula.

Wait, another formula involving AI is that AI = (r)/sin(A/2) = ( (a*b*c)/(4R*s) ) * (s - a), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we have OI = sqrt(13), IA = 2*sqrt(39), and OA = 13.

Wait, but maybe I can find the distance from A to O. Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13, but in the triangle AIO, OA is the hypotenuse. So, in triangle AIO, OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2, which we already used to find IA.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). We already used that to find OI = sqrt(13).

Is there a formula that connects AI, OI, and other elements? Maybe, but perhaps it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities in triangle ABC.

We know angle A, and we have expressions for bc and s. Let me summarize the knowns:

- R = 13
- r
