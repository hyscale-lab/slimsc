Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this. But since there's already an Asymptote figure provided, I can imagine it: triangle ABC with the circumcircle ω, tangents at B and C meeting at D, and then AD cutting the circle again at P.

I remember that tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, that would mean DB = DC. That's a useful property.

Also, since AD meets the circle again at P, AP is a chord of the circle. Maybe I can use some theorem related to chords or intersecting chords?

Wait, another thought: maybe power of a point. Point D lies outside the circle, and DB and DC are tangent to the circle, so the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Because for a point outside a circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the intersection points of a line through the point with the circle.

Yes, that seems right. So, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DA * DP. So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and from that, perhaps find AP.

But wait, I don't know DA yet. So, maybe I need another approach to find DA first.

Alternatively, maybe using triangle properties. Let me think about triangle ABC. The sides are AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, triangle ABC is a scalene triangle.

Wait, perhaps I can compute some angles or other lengths using the Law of Cosines? Let me see. Since we know all three sides, we can compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. Maybe that could help in finding other lengths.

The formula for the circumradius R is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area of the triangle.

So, let me compute the area first using Heron's formula. The sides are a=5, b=9, c=10.

Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So, a=9, b=10, c=5.

Then, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, the area Δ is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)*(12 - 5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step.

12*3 is 36, 36*2 is 72, 72*7 is 504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) but that's not helpful. Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Hmm, no. Let me factor 504.

504 divided by 2 is 252, divided by 2 again is 126, divided by 2 is 6
