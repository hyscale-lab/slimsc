Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks pretty involved, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) are. They’re both defined in terms of absolute values. So f(x) is ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. I should probably sketch these functions to get a better idea.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let me think about how this looks. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down, so the vertex becomes at (0,-1/2). Taking the absolute value of that would flip any negative parts back up. So, the graph of f(x) will have a V-shape as well, but it's a bit modified. The point where |x| - 1/2 = 0 is at |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So, the original V after shifting down would have a "V" that touches the x-axis at x = ±1/2. Then taking the absolute value of that, which would reflect any negative parts. Wait, but |x| - 1/2 is always positive except between -1/2 and 1/2, right? Because for |x| < 1/2, |x| -1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes 1/2 - |x|. So, the graph of f(x) is a W shape? Or maybe two Vs. Let me think: for |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V opening upwards with vertex at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). For |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, which is an upside-down V with vertex at (0, 1/2). So altogether, f(x) looks like a diamond shape with vertices at (-1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (1/2,0). Got it.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's do the same analysis. The inner |x| is a V with vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/4 shifts it down, so the vertex is at (0,-1/4). Then taking the absolute value. The point where |x| - 1/4 = 0 is |x| = 1/4, so x = ±1/4. For |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4, which is a V opening upwards with vertices at (1/4,0) and (-1/4,0). For |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, which is an upside-down V with vertex at (0,1/4). So g(x) is a diamond shape with vertices at (-1/4,0), (0,1/4), and (1/4,0).

Alright, now I need to understand 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let me start with y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's see what this function looks like.

First, the innermost function is sin(2πx). The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 1, since the period of sin(2πx) is 2π/(2π) =1. So sin(2πx) has a wave that completes one full cycle every integer x.

Then, f is applied to that. So f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's think about the range of |sin(2πx)|, which is between 0 and 1. So when |sin(2πx)| is 0, f(0) is |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 1, f(1) is |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, wait, let me correct that. f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So when x is between 0 and 1, f(x) is a diamond as we saw earlier, with peaks at 1/2. So when x is in [0, 1/2], f(x) = 1/2 - x. When x is in [1/2,1], f(x) = x - 1/2. So when we have f(sin(2πx)), since sin varies between -1 and 1, but after absolute value, it's between 0 and 1.

So when |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1/2, f(|sin(2πx)|) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|. When |sin(2πx)| is between 1/2 and 1, f(|sin(2πx)|) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. So f(sin(2πx)) varies between 0 and 1/2. Because when |sin| is 0, f is 1/2; when |sin| is 1/2, f is 0; when |sin| is 1, f is 1/2 again.

Then, g is applied to f(sin(2πx)). So g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|. Let’s think about the range of f(sin(2πx)), which is 0 to 1/2. So, when f(sin(2πx)) is between 0 and 1/4, g will be 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)). When f(sin(2πx)) is between 1/4 and 1/2, g will be f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4. So the output of g(f(...)) will be between 0 and 1/4.

Then we multiply by 4, so 4 * g(f(...)) will be between 0 and 1. So the entire function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1. Let's see how it behaves.

When f(sin(2πx)) is in [0,1/4], g(f(...)) is 1/4 - f(...), so 4g(...) = 1 - 4f(...). When f(...) is in [1/4,1/2], g(...) is f(...) - 1/4, so 4g(...) = 4(f(...) - 1/4) = 4f(...) -1. So the function y(x) is piecewise linear, with breaks where f(sin(2πx)) crosses 1/4.

So, to find y(x), I need to see how sin(2πx) affects f and g.

Similarly, for the other equation x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's go through the same process.

cos(3πy) is a cosine function with amplitude 1, and period 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So it completes a full cycle every 2/3 y. The argument is 3πy, so when y increases by 1, the argument increases by 3π, meaning it's a cosine that goes through 1.5 cycles per unit y.

Taking the absolute value, |cos(3πy)| varies between 0 and 1. Then f is applied, so f(|cos(3πy)|) is |||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. Same as before, when |cos| is between 0 and 1/2, f is 1/2 - |cos|, and when |cos| is between 1/2 and 1, f is |cos| - 1/2. So f(|cos|) varies between 0 and 1/2.

Then g is applied to that, so g(f(...)) is ||f(...) - 1/4|. So when f(...) is in [0,1/4], g is 1/4 - f(...). When f(...) is in [1/4,1/2], g is f(...) - 1/4. Then multiplied by 4, so 4g(...) is 1 - 4f(...) when f(...) is in [0,1/4], and 4f(...) -1 when f(...) is in [1/4,1/2]. So the entire function x(y) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillates between 0 and 1 as y varies.

So both y and x are functions that oscillate between 0 and 1 with different periods and frequencies.

The problem is to find the number of intersections between these two graphs. That is, points (x, y) where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x =4g(f(cos(3πy))).

This seems a bit tricky because it's a system where each variable is defined in terms of the other. So, to find the intersection points, we can try to set up equations and see how many solutions exist.

Let me consider substituting one equation into the other. Let's denote:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) ... (1)

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) ... (2)

So, substituting equation (1) into equation (2) gives:

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = 4g(f(cos(3π * 4g(f(sin(2πx)))))).

But that seems very complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can analyze the possible ranges and periodicities.

Let me think about the periods of the functions.

For y(x) = 4g(f(sin(2πx))):

The function sin(2πx) has period 1, so sin(2π(x + 1)) = sin(2πx). Then f and g are applied, but since they are absolute value functions, they are even functions, so the period is preserved.

So, the entire function y(x) should have period 1. Similarly, x(y) =4g(f(cos(3πy))) has the inner function cos(3πy), which has period 2/3, as discussed earlier. So cos(3π(y + 2/3)) = cos(3πy + 2π) = cos(3πy). So, the period for x(y) is 2/3.

But since both functions are periodic, their compositions might have a common period, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 1 and 2/3. The LCM of 1 and 2/3 is 2, because 2 is the smallest number that is an integer multiple of both 1 and 2/3 (since 2 = 2*1 and 2 = 3*(2/3)). So, the overall system might have a period of 2, meaning that the intersections would repeat every 2 units. Therefore, if I can find the number of intersections in one period, say from x=0 to x=2, I can multiply by the number of periods in the interval I'm considering. But wait, since both equations are defined over all real numbers, but we're looking for all intersections, maybe the system is periodic with period 2, so the number of intersections per 2 units is the same everywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the domain to consider is [0,1] for x and [0,1] for y, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think.

Wait, looking closer at the functions:

y =4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function from real numbers to [0,1], as we saw earlier.

Similarly, x=4g(f(cos(3πy))) is a function from real numbers to [0,1].

So, the graphs are subsets of the plane where x and y are each between 0 and 1, but it's not clear. Wait, actually, x can be any real number, but the function 4g(f(...)) outputs values in [0,1]. So actually, for the equation x=4g(f(cos(3πy))), x is constrained to [0,1], because 4g(f(...)) can't be outside [0,1]. Similarly, for y=4g(f(sin(2πx))), y is in [0,1]. So the graphs are both subsets of the square [0,1]x[0,1].

That's an important point. So, we can limit our search for intersection points to the square where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of intersections of y=4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4g(f(cos(3πy))) within the square [0,1]x[0,1].

Now, let's analyze each function within this square.

First, let's understand y(x) =4g(f(sin(2πx))). Since sin(2πx) has a period of 1, and x is in [0,1], sin(2πx) goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to 0 as x goes from 0 to 0.5 to 1. But because we have absolute value inside, |sin(2πx)|, so it's always non-negative. So, |sin(2πx)| goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0 as x goes from 0 to 0.5 to 1. So, f(|sin(2πx)|) is |||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

So when |sin| is 0, f=1/2. When |sin| is 1/2, f=0. When |sin| is 1, f=1/2 again. So f(|sin|) is a waveform that goes from 1/2 down to 0 and back to 1/2 as |sin| goes from 0 to 1/2 to 1 to 1/2 to 0. Then, g(f(...)) is ||f(...) - 1/4|.

So, when f(...) is between 0 and 1/4, g(...) is 1/4 - f(...). When f(...) is between 1/4 and 1/2, it's f(...) - 1/4. So, 4g(...) is 1 - 4f(...) when f(...) is in [0,1/4], and 4f(...) -1 when f(...) is in [1/4,1/2].

So, y(x) is a piecewise linear function with changes at points where f(...) =1/4.

Now, let's find where f(|sin(2πx)|) =1/4.

f(|sin(2πx)|) = | | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

So, set | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | =1/4.

This implies two cases:

1. |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 = 1/4 → |sin(2πx)| = 3/4.
2. |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 = -1/4 → |sin(2πx)| = 1/4.

So, |sin(2πx)| = 3/4 or 1/4.

Thus, sin(2πx) = ±3/4 or ±1/4.

Therefore, for x in [0,1], 2πx goes from 0 to 2π. So, sin(θ) = ±1/4 and ±3/4 will each have two solutions in [0, 2π]. So, for each of the four cases, two solutions, meaning 8 solutions in total for x in [0,1]. Hmm, but wait, for each positive value, sin(θ) = a has two solutions in [0, 2π], but since we have absolute value, |sin(2πx)| = a, so each a>0 will give two solutions in [0, π] and two in [π, 2π], but wait, no. Let me correct.

Actually, |sin(θ)| = a is equivalent to sin(θ) = a or sin(θ) = -a. Each of these has two solutions in [0, 2π]. So for each a, four solutions? No, in [0, 2π], sin(theta) = a has two solutions, and sin(theta) = -a has two solutions, so four solutions in total. But since we have |sin(theta)|=a, which is the same as sin(theta)=a or sin(theta)=-a, which in [0, 2π] each have two solutions, so four solutions in total. Therefore, for each a, four solutions for theta, meaning four solutions for x=theta/(2π). So, for each a, 4 x's in [0,1].

But wait, in our case, a can be 1/4 or 3/4. So, let me think: for |sin(2πx)| =1/4, we have four solutions in x in [0,1]. Similarly, for |sin(2πx)| =3/4, four more solutions. So, in total, 8 points in x where f(|sin(2πx)|) =1/4. These are the points where y(x) changes its slope.

So, for each x interval between two consecutive roots of f(...) =1/4, y(x) is either 1 - 4f(...) or 4f
