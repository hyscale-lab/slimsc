Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel, and the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or something? But wait, it's equilateral, so all sides are equal in length. But since it's convex and opposite sides are parallel, it might have some properties similar to a regular hexagon but maybe not as symmetrical.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. So, if I extend these three sides, they form a triangle. That must mean that each of these sides is a side of the triangle, right? So, AB, CD, and EF, when extended, form a triangle with those specific lengths.

Wait, but in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, but in this case, it's an equilateral hexagon, so all sides are equal, but maybe not all angles are equal. Hmm, not sure. But perhaps the properties of the triangle formed by extending certain sides can help me find the side length of the hexagon.

I think I should recall that in such a hexagon, the sides can be thought of as vectors. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, each pair of opposite sides can be considered as vectors that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Maybe this can help me model the hexagon in a coordinate system.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the hexagon as being formed by three parallelograms. Since each pair of opposite sides is parallel, the hexagon can be divided into three parallelograms. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, another approach: in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal, it's called a zonogon. And in such a zonogon, the sides can be grouped into three pairs of equal and parallel sides. So, that might be the case here.

But how does the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF come into play? So, if I extend AB, CD, EF, they meet to form a triangle with sides
