Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm. So N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. And we need the greatest such number. After finding N, we divide it by 1000 and add the quotient and remainder.

Alright, let's break this down. Let me denote N as a four-digit number ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A being the thousands digit, B the hundreds, C the tens, and D the units.

So N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

The property is that changing any single digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. That means:

- Changing A to 1: 1BCD is divisible by 7
- Changing B to 1: A1CD is divisible by 7
- Changing C to 1: AB1D is divisible by 7
- Changing D to 1: ABC1 is divisible by 7

So each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest possible N (so we want to maximize A, then B, then C, then D) that satisfies these conditions.

Since N is the greatest, we should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until we find such a number. But that might be time-consuming, so maybe we can find a smarter approach.

Let me think about each condition.

First, let's consider each modification:

1. Changing A to 1: The number becomes 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Let's denote this as N1.

2. Changing B to 1: The number becomes 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D. Let's denote this as N2.

3. Changing C to 1: The number becomes 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D. Let's denote this as N3.

4. Changing D to 1: The number becomes 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1. Let's denote this as N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7. So each of them must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

So, mathematically:

1. N1 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N2 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N3 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me write these congruences:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can compute the values modulo 7 for each of these expressions.

Let me first compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

- 1000 ÷ 7: 7*142 = 994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.
- 100 ÷7: 7*14=98, remainder 2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod7.
- 10 ÷7: 1*7=7, remainder 3. So 10 ≡3 mod7.
- 1 is obviously 1 mod7.

So let's rewrite the congruences using these:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

So, the four congruences become:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod7 (since 6 ≡ -1 mod7, so -1 + 2B +3C + D ≡0 → 2B+3C+D ≡1)
Wait, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, for the first congruence:

N1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

So, 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 → 2B +3C + D ≡ -6 mod7 → -6 mod7 is 1 mod7 (since -6=1 mod7). So yes, 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, for N2:

N2: 1000A + 100 +10C + D ≡6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7

So, 6A +3C + D +2 ≡0 mod7 → 6A +3C + D ≡-2 mod7 → -2 is 5 mod7 (since -2 +7=5). So:

6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

For N3:

N3: 1000A +100B +10 +D ≡6A +2B +3 +D ≡0 mod7

So, 6A +2B + D ≡ -3 mod7 → -3 is 4 mod7 (since 7-3=4). So:

6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

For N4:

N4: 1000A +100B +10C +1 ≡6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7

So, 6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7 → 6A +2B +3C ≡-1 mod7 → -1 is 6 mod7.

So:

6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

So, summarizing the four congruences:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7  --> Equation (1)
2. 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7  --> Equation (2)
3. 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7  --> Equation (3)
4. 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7  --> Equation (4)

Hmm. So we have four equations with variables A, B, C, D. Each variable is a digit (0-9, except A which is 1-9). We need to find A, B, C, D such that all four congruences are satisfied, and N=ABCD is as large as possible.

Since we want the largest N, we should try to maximize A first, then B, then C, then D.

Given that, perhaps we can try A=9 first and see if there's a solution with A=9. If not, try A=8, etc.

Let me attempt this approach.

Starting with A=9.

So, A=9.

Let's plug A=9 into Equations (2), (3), and (4):

Equation (2): 6*9 +3C + D =54 +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

But 54 mod7: 7*7=49, 54-49=5. So 54 ≡5 mod7. So:

5 +3C + D ≡5 mod7 → 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation (3):6*9 +2B + D =54 +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

54 mod7 is 5 as above. So:

5 +2B + D ≡4 mod7 → 2B + D ≡-1 mod7 → 2B + D ≡6 mod7.

Equation (4):6*9 +2B +3C =54 +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

54 mod7 is 5. So:

5 +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 → 2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

And Equation (1): 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

So let's write down the equations we get with A=9:

From (2): 3C + D ≡0 mod7. --> Equation (2a)
From (3): 2B + D ≡6 mod7. --> Equation (3a)
From (4):2B +3C ≡1 mod7. --> Equation (4a)
From (1):2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7. --> Equation (1a)

Wait, but Equation (1a) can be derived from Equations (4a) and (2a). Because:

From (4a): 2B +3C ≡1.

From (2a):3C + D ≡0 → D ≡ -3C mod7.

Substitute D into Equation (1a):

2B +3C + (-3C) ≡1 mod7 → 2B ≡1 mod7 → 2B ≡1 mod7.

So, from Equation (4a): 2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

And from Equation (3a): 2B + D ≡6 mod7.

But D ≡ -3C mod7, so 2B + (-3C) ≡6 mod7.

But from Equation (4a): 2B +3C ≡1.

So, let me note that:

Equation (3a) becomes: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Equation (4a): 2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

So, we have a system of two equations:

2B -3C ≡6 mod7 --> Equation (3b)

2B +3C ≡1 mod7 --> Equation (4b)

Let me subtract Equation (3b) from Equation (4b):

[2B +3C] - [2B -3C] ≡1 -6 mod7

Which is 6C ≡-5 mod7 → 6C ≡2 mod7 (since -5=2 mod7).

So, 6C ≡2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 6 mod7 is the number x such that 6x ≡1 mod7. Testing numbers:

6*6=36 ≡1 mod7 (since 35 is 5*7). So inverse is 6.

So, multiplying both sides by 6:

C ≡2*6 mod7 → C ≡12 mod7 → C ≡5 mod7.

So, C is congruent to 5 modulo7. Since C is a digit (0-9), possible values for C are 5 and 12, but 12 is not a digit. So C=5.

So C=5.

Now, back to Equation (4a): 2B +3*5 ≡1 mod7 → 2B +15 ≡1 mod7.

15 mod7 is 1 (since 14 is 2*7). So 2B +1 ≡1 mod7 → 2B ≡0 mod7.

So 2B ≡0 mod7 → B ≡0 mod7/ gcd(2,7)=1, so B must be ≡0 mod7.

Since B is a digit (0-9), possible values are 0,7.

But we want the largest possible N, so we should take the largest possible B. So B=7.

Now, let's check if B=7 and C=5.

From Equation (2a):3C + D ≡0 mod7 → 15 + D ≡0 mod7.

15 mod7 is 1, so 1 + D ≡0 → D ≡-1 mod7 → D=6 (since 6 mod7 is 6, and -1 mod7 is 6).

So D=6.

So, with A=9, B=7, C=5, D=6, we have N=9756.

Now, let's check if this satisfies all four conditions.

Let's compute N1, N2, N3, N4.

N1: Change A to 1: 1756.

Check if 1756 ÷7: 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6 → remainder 6. Not divisible by7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, that can't be. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, according to the equations, N1 should be divisible by7. So perhaps I made a mistake in solving the equations.

Wait, let's double-check the steps.

We had A=9, and then:

Equation (2a):3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation (3a):2B + D ≡6 mod7.

Equation (4a):2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

Equation (1a):2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

We derived that 2B ≡1 mod7, from Equation (1a) and (4a) and (2a).

Wait, but let me retrace.

Wait, when I substituted D from Equation (2a) into Equation (1a), I got 2B ≡1.

But let's see:

From Equation (1a): 2B +3C + D ≡1.

From Equation (2a): D ≡-3C mod7.

So substituting into (1a): 2B +3C + (-3C) ≡1 → 2B ≡1.

So yes, 2B ≡1 mod7.

So 2B ≡1 → B ≡4 mod7 (since 2*4=8≡1 mod7).

Wait, earlier I thought that 2B ≡0, but that was a mistake.

Wait no, wait. Let me see.

Wait, when I had Equation (4a): 2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

And Equation (3b): 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Adding these two equations:

(2B +3C) + (2B -3C) =4B ≡1 +6=7≡0 mod7.

So 4B ≡0 mod7 → 4B is divisible by7. Since 4 and7 are coprime, B≡0 mod7.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 2B ≡1 mod7, which would imply B≡4 mod7. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when subtracting equations.

Let me re-express the situation.

We had:

Equation (3b): 2B -3C ≡6.

Equation (4b): 2B +3C ≡1.

If I add these two equations:

(2B -3C) + (2B +3C) =4B ≡6 +1=7≡0 mod7.

So 4B ≡0 mod7 → B≡0 mod7.

So B must be 0 or7.

If B=7, then from Equation (4b):2*7 +3C ≡1 mod7 →14 +3C ≡1 mod7 →14 mod7 is 0, so 3C ≡1 mod7 → C ≡5 mod7 (since 3*5=15≡1 mod7).

So C=5.

Then from Equation (2a):3*5 + D ≡0 mod7 →15 + D ≡0 →15 mod7 is1, so D≡-1≡6 mod7. So D=6.

So with A=9, B=7, C=5, D=6.

So N=9756.

But when we change A to1, the number becomes 1756. Let's check 1756 ÷7.

1756 divided by7: 7*250=1750, remainder 6. So 1756 is not divisible by7. Hmm.

So that suggests that something is wrong with the reasoning because according to the problem statement, changing A to1 should give a number divisible by7.

So perhaps there's a mistake in my calculations.

Let me recompute N1.

N1: Changing A to1: 1BCD =1000 + 100B +10C + D.

Which, when A=9, B=7, C=5, D=6, would be 1756.

Wait, but 1756 ÷7: Let me compute it properly.

7*250=1750. 1756-1750=6. So 1756=7*250 +6. So remainder 6, not divisible by7. So that's a problem.

So either my equations are wrong, or I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, maybe I messed up the modulo calculations. Let me re-express the four conditions with A=9, B=7, C=5, D=6.

Compute N1: 1000 + 100*7 +10*5 +6 =1000 +700 +50 +6=1756.

1756 mod7: Let me compute 1756 ÷7. 7*250=1750, remainder 6. So 1756≡6 mod7, which is not 0. So that's a problem.

So, the solution I found doesn't satisfy the first condition. So something is wrong.

Wait,
