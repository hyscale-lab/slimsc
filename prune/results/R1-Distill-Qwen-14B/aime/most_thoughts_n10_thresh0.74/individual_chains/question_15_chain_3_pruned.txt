Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. That makes sense because an 8x8 grid has 7 horizontal and 7 vertical lines on each side, so to go from one corner to the opposite, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 moves. 

The key here is that the paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I remember that in grid path problems, the number of steps in each direction is fixed, but the order in which you take them can vary. So normally, without any restrictions on direction changes, the number of paths would be the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But here we have a restriction on the number of direction changes.

Wait, direction changes. So, when moving from one step to the next, if you change from moving right to up or vice versa, that's a direction change. So the path is made up of segments, each in a straight line either right or up, and each time you switch direction, that's a new segment. 

If a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that translate into the number of segments? Let's think. Each time you change direction, you start a new segment. So if you start moving right, then change to up, that's the first change, creating two segments. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Suppose the path starts by moving right. Then, the first segment is right. Then, when it changes direction to up, that's the first direction change. So each direction change adds a new segment. So if there are four direction changes, that would mean the path is made up of five segments. Because the initial direction is one segment, and each change adds another. So, four changes lead to five segments.

Wait, is that correct? Let me take an example. Suppose the first segment is right, then up, then right, then up, then right. How many direction changes? Right to up is one, up to right is two, right to up is three, up to right is four. So four direction changes, which leads to five segments. Yes, that makes sense.

So, each path with four direction changes has five segments. Now, each segment is a straight line either to the right or upward. Since the path starts at the lower left corner and ends at the upper right, the overall movement is 8 right and 8 up steps.

So, if the path has five segments, they must alternate between right and up. So it's either right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, but wait, that can't be because five segments would require either three rights and two ups or three ups and two rights? Hmm, no, wait.

Wait, no. The number of right and up segments depends on whether the number of segments is odd or even. If you start with a right segment, then the segments alternate R, U, R, U, etc. So with five segments, starting with R, you have R, U, R, U, R. That's three R segments and two U segments. Alternatively, starting with U, you
