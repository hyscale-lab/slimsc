Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have two functions: 

The first one is y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second one is x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))). 

I need to find the number of intersections of their graphs. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the functions f and g. They are defined as:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Wait, so f and g are both functions that take the absolute value of something, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. That probably means their graphs are V-shaped, maybe.

Let me try to sketch f(x) and g(x) in my mind. 

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

So, the inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so that shifts the graph down by 1/2. But since we have absolute value again, any negative part will be reflected upwards. So, the graph of f(x) will have its vertex where |x| - 1/2 is zero, which is at x = ±1/2. Before that, when |x| < 1/2, f(x) will be 1/2 - |x|. After that, when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) will be |x| - 1/2.

So f(x) has a V-shape with its minimum at x=±1/2, y=0, and it goes upwards on both sides, forming a W shape maybe? Wait no, actually, because after subtracting 1/2 and taking absolute value, f(x) will have a V shape with a vertex at (0, 1/2), then it slopes down to (1/2, 0) and then back up again? No, wait, that might not be accurate.

Wait, let's think about it. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:

- When x is between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| is less than 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is negative. Taking absolute value, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|.

- For x outside that interval, |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, and f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

So, the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that peaks at (0, 1/2), then slopes down to (1/2, 0), and then continues as a V on the right side. Similarly on the left side.

So, the graph of f(x) is like a W but it's actually two Vs back-to-back? Or perhaps it's a V shape that's inverted in the middle? Wait, maybe it's a V that's been adjusted. Let me think numerically:

At x=0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

At x=1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.

At x=1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

So, the graph goes from 1/2 at x=0, down to 0 at x=1/2, and then back up to 1/2 at x=1. Similarly on the negative side. So, the graph of f(x) is a diamond shape between x=-1 and x=1, peaking at 1/2 at x=0 and
