Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. These types of games often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of how the opponent plays. A losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

So, in this case, the starting player is Alice. We need to find all n ≤ 2024 where Bob can win, which would mean that the starting position n is a losing position for Alice. Therefore, Bob can always respond in a way that forces Alice into a losing position.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe I can use dynamic programming to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position.

Let's define a function f(n) where f(n) = True if the current player can force a win, and False otherwise.

The base case would be when n = 0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move. So, f(0) = False.

For n = 1, the player can take 1 token and win. So, f(1) = True.

n = 2: the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no, that's not right. If the player takes 1, leaving 1, the opponent can take 1 and win. So, the current player might think of taking 1, but that leads to the opponent winning. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So, the current player has to take 1, but that leads to the opponent taking the last one and winning. So, f(2) = False because the current player can't force a win.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me re-examine. If n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent then takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, the current player can't take 4, so they have no other moves. Therefore, the current player has no winning strategy, so f(2) = False.

n=3: the current player can take 1, leaving 2. From n=2, we saw that it's a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So, the opponent would be in a losing position if the current player takes 1. So, f(3) = True.

n=4: the current player can take 4 and win immediately. So, f(4)=True.

n=5: the current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is also a winning position for the opponent. So, the current player can't force a win regardless of the move. Therefore, f(5)=False.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If n=5, if I take 1, leaving 4, the opponent
