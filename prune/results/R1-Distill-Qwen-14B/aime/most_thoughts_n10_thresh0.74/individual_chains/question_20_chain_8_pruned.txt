Okay, so I have this problem where I need to place chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I don't have to use all of them. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for all chips in the same column. Also, any additional chip I try to place would break these rules. Hmm.

Let me try to break this down. So each row must be all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or have no chips. But wait, no, actually, the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip, but it's not clear whether a row or column can be partially filled. Wait, no, the problem states that all chips in the same row must be the same color. So if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color. That includes all white or all black. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but if a row has some chips, they must all be same color, same with columns. So, for example, a row can't have a mix of white and black chips. So that suggests that each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column.

But wait, the problem allows for some cells to have no chips. So each row can be entirely white, entirely black, or empty. The same applies to each column.

But now, there's another condition: any additional chip placed would violate one or more conditions. That probably means that the configuration is maximal in some sense. So, if I try to add another chip, I can't because either the row or column would have mixed colors.

Wait, let's think about that. Suppose I have a configuration where some rows are white, some are black, some are empty. Similarly for columns. But to be maximal, every empty cell must be such that if you placed a chip there, either its row would now have two different colors or its column would have two different colors.

So, for any empty cell (i,j), either row i already has some chips, and adding a chip there would introduce a different color in row i. Or column j already has some chips, and adding a chip would introduce a different color in column j. Or both.

But wait, actually, if row i is empty, can you add a chip? If
