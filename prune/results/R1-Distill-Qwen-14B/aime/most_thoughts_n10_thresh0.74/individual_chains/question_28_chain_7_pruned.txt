Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, which is the same for all faces. The answer should be in the form m√n/p, with m and p coprime, and n square-free. Then find m + n + p.

Hmm, I've heard that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula involving the volume and the surface area. Wait, is it similar to the 2D case where the inradius is area over semiperimeter? In 3D, I think it's 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Yeah, something like that. So I should find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area, then compute 3V divided by the surface area.

But first, let me make sure I understand the tetrahedron. It's given with opposite edges equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron called a "isohedral" tetrahedron? Or maybe "isohedral" is for faces. Wait, not sure. But in any case, the opposite edges are equal, which might mean that the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way, which could help in computing the volume.

I remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a disphenoid. Yeah, that's right. So ABCD is a disphenoid. And for disphenoids, there are some properties that could help simplify the calculation.

In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that right? Or just opposite edges equal? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, I think in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, and the four faces are congruent. So if that's the case, then all four faces have the same area, which would make the surface area four times the area of one face.

But wait, in this problem, the edges are given as AB=CD=sqrt(41), AC=BD=sqrt(80), BC=AD=sqrt(89). So all the edges are in pairs. So each face would have sides like AB, AC, BC, etc. So if all the opposite edges are equal, maybe the faces are congruent. Let me check.

Take face ABC: edges AB, AC, BC. Face ADC: edges AD, DC, AC. Wait, AD=BC, DC=AB, and AC is common. So triangle ABC and ADC have the same side lengths: AB=CD, AC=AC, BC=AD. So they are congruent triangles. Similarly, the other faces should be congruent as well. So all four faces are congruent.

So that means each face has the same area. So if I can compute the area of one face, multiply by four, and that will be the total surface area.

So first, compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC. The sides are AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), and BC = sqrt(89).

Wait, let me compute the sides squared to make it easier. AB² = 41, AC² = 80, BC² = 89. Hmm, 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11². Wait, is that right? 41 + 80 is 121. So AB² + AC² = BC². That means triangle ABC is a right triangle! Because 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11². So triangle ABC is right-angled at A?

Wait, hold on: AB² + AC² = BC². So yes, if AB
