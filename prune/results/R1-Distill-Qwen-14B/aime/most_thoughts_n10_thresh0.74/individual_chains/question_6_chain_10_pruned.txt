Okay, so I have this math problem here. It involves two functions, f(x) and g(x), which are both defined using absolute values. The functions are f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, I'm given two equations: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find the number of intersections of their graphs. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. Both are absolute value functions, so their graphs will likely be V-shaped or composed of line segments. Since each function has nested absolute values, they might have multiple segments.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's consider the inner part first, |x|. That's a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. But since we're taking the absolute value again, ||x| - 1/2|, any negative parts will be flipped above the x-axis. So, where would |x| - 1/2 be negative? That happens when |x| < 1/2, which is between -1/2 and 1/2. In that interval, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so taking the absolute value would make it positive: 1/2 - |x|. So, the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that's wider in the middle. Specifically, for |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V with a vertex at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). Between -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, which is an upside-down V with a vertex at (0, 1/2). So, overall, f(x) has a sort of diamond shape with vertices at (-1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (1/2,0).

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let me analyze this as well. The inner function is |x|, which is the same V-shape. Then, subtract 1/4: |x| - 1/4. Taking the absolute value: ||x| - 1/4|. When is |x| - 1/4 negative? When |x| < 1/4, so between -1/4 and 1/4. In that region, ||x| - 1/4| becomes 1/4 - |x|. For |x| ≥ 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4. So, the graph of g(x) will have a vertex at (0,1/4), and at x = ±1/4, it will switch to the line |x| - 1/4. So, the graph is like a diamond but smaller, with vertices at (-1/4,0), (0,1/4), and (1/4,0).

Now, both f(x) and g(x) are functions that take an input, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value, which leads to their diamond shapes.

Next, I need to consider the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). These look complicated because they involve compositions of functions and trigonometric functions inside.

Let me first try to figure out what 4g(f(z)) looks like for some variable z. Since f(z) and g(z) are both functions that have diamond shapes, applying them to z and then scaling by 4 will affect their ranges.

First, let's compute the ranges of f(z) and g(z).

For f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|, the minimum value is 0, which occurs at z = ±1/2, and the maximum value is 1/2, which occurs at z=0.

Similarly, for g(z) = ||z| - 1/4|, the minimum is 0 at z = ±1/4, and the maximum is 1/4 at z=0.

So, when we compute 4g(f(z)), the range of f(z) is [0, 1/2], so g(f(z)) will take values from g(0) to g(1/2). Let's compute that.

g(0) = ||0| - 1/4| = 1/4.

g(1/2) = ||1/2| - 1/4| = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the maximum and minimum of g(f(z))... wait, no, because f(z) can vary from 0 to 1/2, so g(f(z)) can vary from g(0) = 1/4 to g(1/2) = 1/4. Wait, that can't be right because g(f(z)) would have a maximum when f(z) is 0, which is 1/4, and when f(z) is 1/2, which is 1/4 as well. That suggests that g(f(z)) is constant at 1/4? That doesn't make sense because f(z) varies, so g(f(z)) should vary.

Wait, let me double-check. f(z) can be between 0 and 1/2.

So, for f(z) in [0, 1/2], we have g(f(z)) = ||f(z)| - 1/4|.

So, when f(z) is less than 1/4, say f(z) = t where t < 1/4, then g(t) = (1/4 - t).

When f(z) is >= 1/4, then g(t) = (t - 1/4).

So, as f(z) increases from 0 to 1/2:
