Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem. Let me try to parse it step by step. The tetrahedron is named ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so each pair of opposite edges are equal. That might be a clue that the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way.

The question is asking about a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. That point is called the incenter, right? In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere (inradius) that touches all four faces. So, I need to find the distance from this incenter to each face, which is the inradius.

They mention this distance can be written as m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I need to find m + n + p.

Hmm, so I need to compute the inradius. I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius r can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces).

So, the plan is to compute the volume V and the total surface area S, then compute r as 3V/S.

First, let's find the surface areas of each face. Each face is a triangle. Since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps each pair of opposite faces are congruent? Let me check.

Looking at the edges:

- AB = CD = sqrt(41)
- AC = BD = sqrt(80)
- BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, for face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, faces ABC and ABD have the same edge lengths, meaning they are congruent. Similarly, faces ACD and BCD will also be congruent.

Wait, actually, let me list all faces:

- ABC: AB, BC, AC
- ABD: AB, BD, AD
- ACD: AC, CD, AD
- BCD: BC, CD, BD

Each face has edges of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So all four faces are congruent triangles. That's a useful symmetry.

Hence, each face has the same area. So, if I can compute the area of one face, I can multiply by four to get the total surface area S.

So, let's compute the area of triangle ABC. The sides are a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(89), c = sqrt(80).

I can use Heron's formula for the area. Heron's formula says that area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

Compute s first:

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89) + sqrt(80))/2

Hmm, this might get messy. Alternatively, since all four faces are congruent, maybe it's better to compute the volume first, and then find the inradius.

Wait, but to compute the volume, I might need to find the volume of the tetrahedron, which could be tricky without knowing more about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use another formula for the inradius. Wait, but the formula I know is r = 3V / S.

So, I need both V and S.

Alternatively, perhaps this tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning that all its
