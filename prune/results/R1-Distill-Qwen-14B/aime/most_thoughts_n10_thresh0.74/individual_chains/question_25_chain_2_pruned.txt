Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

There are 900 residents in total. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and every single resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's four items in total: diamond ring (let's call this D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Every resident has at least one of these, I guess, because it says each owns a bag of candy hearts, but maybe they don't necessarily have the others. Wait, no, the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts, so C is something everyone has. The other items—D, G, S—are owned by some subset of the residents.

The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find the number of residents who own all four. Hmm, okay.

I remember this is a problem about sets and their intersections. The principle of inclusion-exclusion comes into play here. Since there are four sets (D, G, S, C), the formula for the union of four sets would be:

Total = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, in this problem, every resident owns at least a candy heart, so C is universal. That might simplify things because C is included in all the other sets. Hmm, but maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem by considering that C is something everyone has, so when we talk about residents owning certain items, the candy hearts are always included, but we have to account for the overlaps.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think in terms of the four items, with C being one of them. So, all residents have C, which means the other three items (D, G, S) are
