Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^(4y) is also equal to 10. Then, I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll write down the equations based on the problem statement. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. The second equation is log_y(x^(4y)) = 10. I think I can use logarithm properties to simplify these expressions.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. I remember that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So applying that here, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, but that's x multiplied by the logarithm of y with base x. Hmm, maybe I can express this differently.

I also know that log_b(a) = (ln a)/(ln b), where ln is the natural logarithm. So, log_x(y) is (ln y)/(ln x). Therefore, the first equation becomes x * (ln y)/(ln x) = 10. Let me write that down:

Equation 1: (x * ln y) / (ln x) = 10.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^(4y)) = 10. Using the same logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Again, using the change of base formula, log_y(x) is (ln x)/(ln y). So, substituting that in, the equation becomes 4y * (ln x)/(ln y) = 10.

Equation 2: (4y * ln x) / (ln y) = 10.

Wait, so now I have two equations:

1. (x ln y) / (ln x) = 10
2. (4y ln x) / (ln y) = 10

Hmm, these look similar but with some variables swapped. Maybe I can set variables to simplify this. Let me denote a = ln x and b = ln y. Then, since x and y are greater than 1, a and b are positive.

So, with this substitution, Equation 1 becomes:

(x * b) / a = 10.

And Equation 2 becomes:

(4y * a) / b = 10.

But x = e^a and y = e^b because a = ln x and b = ln y. So, substituting x and y in terms of a and b:

Equation 1: (e^a * b) / a = 10.

Equation 2: (4 * e^b * a) / b = 10.

So now, I have:

(e^a * b)/a = 10   ...(1)

(4 e^b * a)/b = 10  ...(2)

Hmm, so now I have two equations with variables a and b. Let me try to manipulate these equations to find a relationship between a and b.

Let me denote Equation (1) as:

(e^a * b)/a = 10.

Equation (2) is:

(4 e^b * a)/b = 10.

Wait, since both are equal to 10, I can set them equal to each other:

(e^a * b)/a = (4 e^b * a)/b.

So, cross-multiplying, we get:

e^a * b^2 = 4 e^b * a^2.

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. Let's try that.

Take ln of both sides:

ln(e^a * b^2) = ln(4 e^b * a^2).
