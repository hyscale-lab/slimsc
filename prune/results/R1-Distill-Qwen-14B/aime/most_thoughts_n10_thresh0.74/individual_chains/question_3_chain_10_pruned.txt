Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. If all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. 

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she won a prize, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), and P(B) is the probability of winning any prize. 

So, the probability we need is P(A)/P(B). 

Alright, let's define the terms more clearly. 

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). Let me calculate that: C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, the total number of possible combinations is 210. 

Jen picks one specific combination of 4 numbers. Let's denote her numbers as J. The lottery also picks a combination L of 4 numbers. 

She wins a prize if at least two numbers in J match with L. That means the overlap between J and L is 2, 3, or 4. 

She wins the grand prize if the overlap is exactly 4, which is all four numbers. 

So, to find the conditional probability, I need to calculate two things: 

1. The number of ways L can have exactly 4 numbers matching J. (This is the number of ways for the grand prize.) 

2. The number of ways L can have at least 2 numbers matching J. (This is the total number of prize-winning combinations.) 

Then, the probability will be the ratio of these two numbers. 

Let me start with calculating the number of ways L can exactly match J. Since L has to be exactly the same as J, there's only one such combination. So, the number of grand prize combinations is 1. 

Now, for the number of prize-winning combinations, which includes all cases where L shares 2, 3, or 4 numbers with J. 

Wait, another way to think about it is: the number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers such that at least two are in J. 

So, to compute this, I can think about how many numbers overlap between J and L. So, for each possible overlap (2, 3, 4), I can compute the number of such Ls and sum them up. 

Alternatively, I can compute the total number of Ls minus the number of Ls that have fewer than 2 numbers overlapping with J. That might be easier because sometimes it's simpler to compute the complement. 

Let me try both approaches and see which is better. 

First approach: summing up the cases for overlap of 2, 3, 4. 

The number of ways to choose k numbers from J and (4 - k) numbers from the remaining (10 - 4) = 6 numbers. 

So, for k=2: C(4,2) * C(6,2) 

For k=3: C(4,3) * C(6,1) 

For k=4: C(4,4) * C(6,0) 

Let me compute each term:

k=2: C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15. So, 6*15=90

k=3: C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24

k=4: C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1. So, 1*1=1

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. 

So, the total number of prize-winning combinations is 115. 

Alternatively, using the complement method: the total number of possible Ls is 210. The
