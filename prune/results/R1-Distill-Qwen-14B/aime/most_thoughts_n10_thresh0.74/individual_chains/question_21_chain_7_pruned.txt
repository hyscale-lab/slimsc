Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. They even gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63, and 6+3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Cool, so I get the basic idea.

Now, I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base where there are over ten numbers that fit this b-eautiful criteria.

Let me break down the problem. When a number n is written in base b with exactly two digits, that means n can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, right? So a is at least 1, and both a and c are less than b. So, 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1, and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The other condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Since n = a * b + c, that gives us a + c = sqrt(a * b + c). Hmm, maybe I can square both sides to get rid of the square root. So:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Let me write that out:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Hmm, maybe rearrange terms to get everything on one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Not sure if that helps yet. Let me think about possible values for a and c. Since a and c are digits in base b, their maximum values are b-1. Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be at least b (since the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b in decimal) and less than b².

So, n is between b and b² - 1. Also, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, and their sum is sqrt(n). So, n must be a perfect square. That makes sense because the sum of two integers is sqrt(n), so n must be a square.

Wait, that's important. So n is a perfect square, right? So, n = k² for some integer k. Then, a + c = k, and n = a*b + c. So, combining these, k² = a*b + c, and k = a + c.

So, substituting k = a + c into the first equation:

k² = a*b + c

But c = k - a, so substituting that in:

k² = a*b + (k - a)

Simplify that:

k² = a*b + k - a

Bring all terms to one side:

k² - k = a*(b - 1)

Hmm, okay, so a*(b - 1) must equal k² - k. Since a is a digit in base b, a is between 1 and b-1. So, a is at least 1 and less than b.

Let me write that equation again:

a = (k² - k) / (b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (k² - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result a must be in that range.

Wait, so for a particular base b, I can look for integers k such that:

1. k² is between b and b² -1, since n must be a two-digit number in base b. So, sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(b² -1). But sqrt(b² -1) is a bit less than b, so k is at most b -1, since it's an integer.

Wait, sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so the maximum k is b -1. So, k can be from 2 (since n must be a two-digit number, which is at least b, which is at least 2, so k is at least 2) up to b -1.

So, for each base b, we can check for k from 2 to b-1, and see if (k² -k) is divisible by (b-1). If it is, then a would be (k² -k)/(b -1),
