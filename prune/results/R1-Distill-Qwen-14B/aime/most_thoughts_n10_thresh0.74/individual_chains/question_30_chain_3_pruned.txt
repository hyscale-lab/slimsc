Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Looking at the product, it's over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me see if I can factor this expression or find a pattern. Maybe I can write each term as a polynomial in ω^k. Let's denote z = ω^k for simplicity. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So the product becomes the product over z of (z² - 2z + 2).

Wait, that's a quadratic in z. Maybe I can factor it or relate it to the minimal polynomial. Let's consider the quadratic equation z² - 2z + 2 = 0. The roots would be z = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So, each term in the product is (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) where z = ω^k. Therefore, the entire product is equal to the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Hmm, so that's the same as the product of (ω^k - (1 + i)) times the product of (ω^k - (1 - i)). So, essentially, it's the product over all ω^k of (ω^k - a) where a is (1 + i) and (1 - i) for the two separate products.

Wait, but the product over all ω^k of (x - ω^k) is equal to x¹³ - 1, because the roots of x¹³ - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. But in our case, we have (x - ω^k) for each k, so the product is x¹³ - 1.

But in our case, the product is over (ω^k - a) for each k, which is the same as (-1)^13 times the product of (a - ω^k). Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 is -1. So the product becomes - (a¹³ - 1). Because product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a¹³ - 1.

Wait, let me clarify: The product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x¹³ - 1. So, if I substitute x with a, then product (a - ω^k) = a¹³ - 1. But in our case, it's product (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 * product (a - ω^k) = - (a¹³ - 1).

So, each of our products, for a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i, can be written as - (a¹³ - 1).

Therefore, the original product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] times [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I remember that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4. So, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

When raised to the 13th power:

(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^13. Let's see, sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so 2^{1/2 *13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the exponential terms:

13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π/4 + 3π. Since angles are periodic mod 2π, 13π/4 is equivalent to 13π/4 - 3*2π = 13π/4 - 12π/4 = π/4. But wait, wait. 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is π/4 more than 3π, which is 3π, which is equivalent
