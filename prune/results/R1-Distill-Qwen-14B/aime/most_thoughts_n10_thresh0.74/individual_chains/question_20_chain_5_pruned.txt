Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. I need to place some of them in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for all chips in the same column. Also, the placement should be such that if I add any more chips, it would violate these conditions. 

Hmm, let me break this down. So each row must be entirely one color, right? Because if any row has both white and black chips, that's not allowed. Similarly, each column must be entirely one color. So, effectively, each row and each column is a single color, either white or black.

Wait, but then the placement is such that no additional chip can be placed without violating the same-color condition. That probably means that in the current placement, every possible cell that could take a chip without violating the row and column color constraints is already filled. So, the placement is maximal in some sense.

Let me think about the structure. Each row has to be all white or all black. Similarly, each column has to be all white or all black. But there's a catch: if a row is all white, then in each column that intersects this row, the entire column must be white as well. Because if a column has a white chip in a row, and another chip in the same column is black, that would violate the column condition. Wait, noâ€”no, actually, if a column has both white and black chips, that's not allowed. So, if any cell in a column is white, the entire column must be white.

Wait, so if I have a row that's all white, then for each column in that row, the entire column must be white as well. Because if a column has a white chip in one row, then all chips in that column must be white. That would imply that if I have even a single white chip in a column, the entire column must be white.

But wait, that's not entirely correct. Because suppose I have a column that is all white except for one row where it's black. That's not allowed. So, columns can't have mixed colors. Same for rows.

So, each row is either all white or all black, and each column is either all white or all black.

But then, what's the relationship between the rows and columns? If a row is white, then all columns intersecting it must be white? Because if a column intersects a white row, then all cells in that column must be white. Similarly, if a column is black, then all rows intersecting it must be black. 

Wait, that seems like a critical point. Let me try to visualize.

Suppose I have a white row. Then, in every column that this row intersects, the entire column must be white. So, if any row is white, all the columns in that row must be white. Similarly, if any column is white, then all the rows intersecting that column must be white.

But that seems like either all rows and all columns are white or black, but that's not possible because we have 25 chips of each color. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because each row and column is independently chosen to be white or black, but subject to the constraint that
