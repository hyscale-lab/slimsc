Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then, find p + q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume is lwh. So, the box has surface area 54 and volume 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box. The space diagonal d of a box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius r would be d/2, which means r squared is (d²)/4. Therefore, r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, the goal is to minimize l² + w² + h² given the constraints of surface area and volume. So, I need to find the minimum of l² + w² + h² given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

Hmm, okay, so we have two equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 => lw + lh + wh = 27
2. lwh = 23

And we need to minimize l² + w² + h².

I think I can use some optimization techniques here. Maybe Lagrange multipliers? Or perhaps express variables in terms of each other using the given constraints.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to assume that the minimal sphere occurs when the box is a cube? Wait, but if the box were a cube, then l = w = h. Let me check that.

If it's a cube, then surface area would be 6l² = 54 => l² = 9 => l=3. Then volume would be 3³=27. But in our problem, the volume is 23, not 27. So, it's not a cube. Therefore, the minimal sphere probably doesn't correspond to a cube. So, the box is not a cube.

Hmm, so maybe I need to set up equations using the given constraints.

Let me denote S = l + w + h, P = lw + lh + wh = 27, V = lwh =23.

We need to find l² + w² + h². Wait, I know that l² + w² + h² = (l + w + h)² - 2(lw + lh + wh) = S² - 2P. Since P is 27, it's S² - 54.

So, to find l² + w² + h², which is S² -54, I need to find S, the sum of the sides.

So, if I can express S in terms of V and P, perhaps using some inequalities.

I remember that for positive real numbers, there are inequalities involving S, P, and V.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the AM ≥ GM inequality or other symmetric inequalities.

Wait, maybe using the method of Lagrange multipliers would be appropriate here since we have constraints and an objective function.

Let me try that.

So, the function to minimize is f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h².

Subject to the constraints:

g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) -54 =0

and

h(l, w, h) = lwh -23 =0.

This is a constrained optimization problem with two constraints. So, I can set up the Lagrangian:

L = l² + w² + h² - λ[2(lw + lh + wh) -54] - μ[lwh -23]

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to l, w, h, λ, and μ, set them to zero.

Compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂l = 2l - λ[2(w + h)] - μ(wh) =0

Similarly,

∂L/∂w = 2w - λ[2(l + h)] - μ(lh) =0

∂L/∂h = 2h - λ[2(l + w)] - μ(lw) =0

And the constraints:

2(lw + lh + wh) =54

lwh=23

So, now we have five equations:

1. 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh =0

2. 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh =0

3. 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw =0

4. 2(lw + lh + wh) =54

5. lwh=23

Hmm, okay, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find symmetry or ratios between l, w, h.

Let me assume that two of the variables are equal. Let's say l = w. Maybe the minimal configuration occurs when two sides are equal. Let me test this assumption.

If l = w, then we can set l = w = a, and h = b.

So, our variables are a, a, b.

Then, the surface area equation becomes:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(a² + 2ab) = 54

Which is 2a² +4ab =54 => a² +2ab=27.

The volume equation is a² b =23 => b=23/(a²)

Substitute b into the surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23/(a²))=27

Simplify:

a² + (46/a) =27

Multiply both sides by a to eliminate denominator:

a³ +46=27a

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ -27a +46=0

Now, we have a cubic equation in a: a³ -27a +46=0.

Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Test a=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0

a=2:8 -54 +46=0. Oh, a=2 is a root.

So, we can factor out (a-2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide a³ -27a +46 by (a-2).

Set up synthetic division:

2 | 1 0 -27 46

Bring down 1. Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient: 0+2=2.

Multiply 2 by 2:4. Add to -27: -23.

Multiply -23 by 2: -46. Add to 46: 0. So, no remainder.

Hence, the cubic factors as (a-2)(a² +2a -23)=0.

So, the roots are a=2, and a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ±4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ±2sqrt(6).

Since a is a length, it must be positive. So, a=2 or a=-1 +2sqrt(6) ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible a=2 or a≈3.898.

But let's check for a=2:

If a=2, then b=23/(a²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box would have sides 2,2,5.75.

Let's compute l² +w² +h²: 4 +4 + (5.75)^2= 8 +33.0625=41.0625. So, r²=41.0625/4=10.265625.

Alternatively, for a≈3.898, let's compute b=23/(a²). Let me compute a²: (approx 3.898)^2≈15.194. So, b≈23/15.194≈1.514.

So, the box would be approximately 3.898,3.8
