Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They want this probability expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize (so all four numbers match), and event B is winning a prize (at least two numbers match). 

Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two numbers matching, the intersection A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B). 

So, I need to calculate two things: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize (at least two matches). Then, divide the grand prize probability by the prize probability to get the conditional probability.

First, let's figure out how many possible ways there are for the 4 numbers to be chosen. Since the lottery is selecting 4 numbers out of 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). Let me calculate that:

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, there are 210 possible combinations for the lottery numbers.

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. That means Jen's 4 numbers match exactly the 4 chosen. Since she picks 4 specific numbers, there's only one combination that will win her the grand prize. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, let's compute P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. To find this, it's easier to compute 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two matches (i.e., 0 or 1 matches). 

But wait, actually, in probability, sometimes it's easier to calculate the desired probability directly. Let's see.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the number of favorable outcomes for at least two matches and then divide by the total number of possible outcomes (210). So, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of 4-number combinations that share at least two numbers with Jen's 4 numbers.

Hmm, how do I compute that? Let's think about it.

Suppose Jen has picked 4 specific numbers. Let's say she has numbers A, B, C, D. The lottery also picks 4 numbers. We want the number of 4-number combinations that include at least two of A, B, C, D.

This can be broken down into three cases:

1. Exactly 2 of Jen's numbers are chosen.
2. Exactly 3 of Jen's numbers are chosen.
3. Exactly 4 of Jen's numbers are chosen.

We can compute each case separately and sum them up.

Case 1: Exactly 2 matches.

The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from Jen's 4 is C(4,2). Then, the remaining 2 numbers must come from the other 6 numbers in S (since S has 10 numbers, and Jen picked 4, so 10-4=6). So, the number of ways is C(4,2) * C(6,2).

Let me calculate that:

C(4,2) = 6.

C(6,2) = 15.

So, 6 * 15 = 90 ways.

Case 2: Exactly 3 matches.

Here, we choose 3 numbers from Jen's 4, and 1 from the remaining 6. The number of ways is C(4,3) * C(6,1).

Calculating:

C(4,3) = 4.

C(6,1) = 6.

So, 4 * 6 = 24 ways.

Case 3: Exactly 4 matches.

That's just 1 way, as before.

So, total favorable outcomes for B is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 90 (for exactly 2) +24 (exactly 3) +1 (exactly 4) is 115. Hmm, but the total number of possible 4-number combinations is 210. So, the probability P(B) is 115 / 210.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but let's see.

Alternatively, another way to compute P(B) is 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match). Let me try that method to confirm.

P(0 matches) is the probability that none of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, the lottery picks 4 numbers from the 6 that Jen didn't pick. The number of ways is C(6,4). So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4) = 15.

Therefore, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Similarly, P(1 match) is the number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, P(1 match) = 80 / 210.

So, 1 - P(0) - P(1) = 1 - (15 +80)/210 = 1 - 95/210 = (210 -95)/210 = 115/210. 

Yes, that matches the earlier result. So, P(B) is 115/210.

So, now, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, really? So, the probability is 1/115. Then, m is 1 and n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 1 and any number are coprime. So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but wait a second, that seems a bit low. Let me think again.

Wait, is the number of favorable outcomes for B correct? Because when I calculated 90 +24 +1=115, that seems correct. 

But let me think about the approach again. The number of ways to
