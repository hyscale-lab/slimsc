Okay, let's try to figure out this game problem between Alice and Bob. So, the game is about a stack of n tokens, and they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is when the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. Let's think about small values of n first and see if we can find a pattern.

Let's list n from 0 upwards and label them as winning (W) or losing (L) positions.

n = 0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is already over, so the player who is supposed to move loses. So, n=0 is a losing position.

n = 1: The player can take 1 token and win. So, W.

n = 2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. But wait, n=1 is a winning position for the next player. So, does that mean the current player can force the opponent into a winning position? Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the current player takes 1, leaving 1, the opponent can take that 1 and win. So, n=2 is a losing position? No, wait, that can't be right because the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 to the opponent, but the opponent can then take that and win. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a pattern where certain n's are losing positions.

Another approach: Let's build a table for small n and see the pattern.

n | outcome (W/L)
0 | L (no move can be made, so current player loses)
1 | W (take 1)
2 | Let's see. From 2, you can take 1, leaving 1. But 1 is a W for the opponent, so opponent can win. Alternatively, can you take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So from 2, you can only take 1, which leaves 1 for the opponent, who can then win. So, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So, L.
Wait, but wait: if you're in n=2 and you take 1, leaving 1, the opponent can take that 1 and win. So yes, n=2 is L.

n=3: From 3, you can take 1, leaving 2 (which is L for the opponent). So, you can force the opponent into a losing position. So, n=3 is W.

n=4: From 4, you can take 4 and win immediately. So, W.

n=5: Let's see. From 5, you can take 1, leaving 4, which is W for the opponent. Or
