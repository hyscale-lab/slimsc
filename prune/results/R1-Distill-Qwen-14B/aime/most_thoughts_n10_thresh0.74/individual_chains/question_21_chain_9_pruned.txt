Okay, so I have this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to parse it out.

Alright, the problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. So, that makes sense.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.

Let me try to structure this.

First, let's understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. A two-digit number in base b would be something like "d1 d0" where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. So, in decimal, that would be d1*b + d0.

But since n has exactly two digits in base b, n must satisfy b ≤ n < b². Because the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is equal to b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² -1.

So, n must be in the range [b, b² - 1].

Moreover, the two digits when expressed in base b must sum to sqrt(n). Let me denote the digits as d1 and d0. So, d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). But n is equal to d1*b + d0. So, sqrt(d1*b + d0) = d1 + d0.

Let me write this equation down:

sqrt(d1*b + d0) = d1 + d0.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side:

d1*b + d0 = d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0².

Let me rearrange this equation:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d1*b - d0 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

d1² + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0² - d0) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of d1, treating d0 as a constant. Alternatively, it could also be considered as a quadratic in terms of d0, treating d1 as a constant.

But both d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so they must satisfy 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b-1 and 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1 (since d1 can't be zero in a two-digit number).

Wait, but actually, in the two-digit number, d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d0 can be from 0 to b-1.

So, for each base b, we can iterate over possible d1 and d0 values, compute n = d1*b + d0, check whether d1 + d0 equals sqrt(n), and count how many such n exist.

But since the problem asks for the minimal b where more than ten such numbers exist, we need an efficient way to calculate for each b, how many n satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe we can derive a formula or find a relationship that allows us to compute
