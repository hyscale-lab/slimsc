Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to understand this.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, the lower left is (0,0) and the upper right is (8,8). So, any path from start to finish will consist of 8 right moves and 8 up moves, in some order. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But that's without considering direction changes.

Wait, but the problem specifies that the path changes direction exactly four times. So, how does that affect the count?

I think direction changes occur when the path switches from moving right to up or vice versa. So, for example, if a path alternates right, up, right, up, etc., each switch is a direction change. But the problem is about exactly four direction changes along the entire path.

Wait, but each time the direction changes, it alternates between right and up. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. Let me think about that.

Suppose the path is made up of segments. Each segment is either all right moves or all up moves. The number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches. So, if a path has k segments, then the number of direction changes is k-1. Because each new segment after the first one is a direction change.

So, in this problem, we have exactly four direction changes. That means the path is composed of 5 segments. Because 4 direction changes divide the path into 5 parts. For example, if the path starts with a right segment, then up, then right, then up, then right, that's four direction changes and five segments.

But wait, the order of these segments matters. The path can start with either a right or an up move. So, depending on whether the first segment is right or up, the subsequent segments alternate directions.

But in our case, since we're moving from (0,0) to (8,8), the path must consist of 8 right moves and 8 up moves in total. So, the sum of all right segments is 8, and the sum of all up segments is 8.

So, the structure of the path is a sequence of right and up segments, alternating each time, with a total of five segments (since four direction changes). The first segment can be either right or up.

Let me consider the two cases separately: paths that start with a right move and paths that start with an up move.

Case 1: Path starts with a right segment.

So, the structure is R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U, R. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the first segment is right, then the segments alternate. So, the number of segments is five. So, the number of right segments is either 3 or 4, depending on whether the
