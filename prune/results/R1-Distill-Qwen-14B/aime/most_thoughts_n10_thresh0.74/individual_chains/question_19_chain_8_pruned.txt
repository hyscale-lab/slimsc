Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The triangle is ABC, and it has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That's interesting. The circumradius is given as 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm. Let me write down what I know.

First, some definitions to get clear:

- The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. It's the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.
- The incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. It's where the angle bisectors meet.
- IA is the segment from the incenter to vertex A.
- OI is the segment connecting the circumcenter to the incenter.
- It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI, so IA ⊥ OI.
- The circumradius R is 13, so the distance from O to any vertex (like A, B, or C) is 13.
- The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

The goal is to find AB · AC.

Okay, so I need to relate these given pieces of information to the sides of the triangle. Let me think about properties involving the inradius, circumradius, and maybe some relations between them.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, let me verify that. I think that's correct. So OI squared equals R times (R minus twice r). Plugging in the values here, R is 13, r is 6.

Calculating OI²: 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OI A has a right angle at I. So in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees.

So triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = OI² + IA².

But I know OA is the circumradius, so OA = 13. So OA² is 169.

We already found OI² is 13, so 169 = 13 + IA². Therefore, IA² = 169 -13 = 156. So IA = sqrt(156). Let me simplify sqrt(156). 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39)=2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2√39.

Now, IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A. Is there a formula for IA in terms of the triangle's sides and angles?

I recall that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed using the formula:

IA = √(r² + (s - a)²)

where r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC.

Wait, let me confirm that formula. I think it's correct because the inradius is r, and the ex-radius or something similar... Wait, no, perhaps it's based on the formula for the length of the angle bisector or something else. Alternatively, maybe using trigonometry.

Alternatively, in triangle AIO, since we have a right triangle, and we know OI and IA, perhaps we can relate some angles here.

But maybe another approach. Let me think about coordinates. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system could help.

Let me consider placing point I at the origin (0,0). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is the segment from I to O, which is at (h,k) since I is at (0,0). Wait, but IA is
