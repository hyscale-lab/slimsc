Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n^4 + 1 for some n. Once I find that p, then I have to find the smallest m where m^4 + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should figure out for which primes p, p² divides n^4 + 1 for some n. I know that n^4 + 1 factors as (n² + √2n + 1)(n² - √2n + 1), but that might not be helpful here since √2 is irrational. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of modular arithmetic.

Wait, maybe I should look at primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. That is, there exists some n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod p. Then, for p² to divide n^4 +1, n would have to satisfy n^4 ≡ -1 mod p². So, we need primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p².

But first, let's think about primes where -1 is a quadratic residue. I remember that for odd primes p, -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. But here we're dealing with quartic residues.

Wait, quartic residues are a subset of quadratic residues. So, if -1 is a quartic residue mod p², then it must also be a quadratic residue mod p². But for that, perhaps certain conditions on p must hold.

Alternatively, maybe I should check small primes and see if any of their squares divide n^4 +1 for some n.

Let me try the small primes one by one.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if 2²=4 divides n^4 +1 for some n.

n=1: 1 +1=2. 2 is not divisible by 4.

n=2: 16 +1=17. 17 mod 4 is 1, so not divisible.

n=3: 81 +1=82. 82 mod 4 is 2, not divisible.

n=4: 256 +1=257. 257 mod 4 is 1, same as above.

Wait, so for p=2, n^4 is always 0 or 1 mod 4. If n is even, n^4 is 0 mod 4, so n^4 +1 is 1 mod 4. If n is odd, n^4 is 1 mod 4, so n^4 +1 is 2 mod 4. So, in either case, n
