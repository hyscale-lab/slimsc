Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of that circle. So the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere or outside. When it's inside, they're tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and find m + n.

Hmm. So I need to find the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases.

Let me think about how a torus and a sphere can be tangent. When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere would be along the line connecting the centers. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the farthest point would be along that line.

Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think more carefully.

First, let's model the torus. The torus can be represented in 3D coordinates as all points (x, y, z) where the distance from (x, y, z) to the axis of rotation is equal to the minor radius, which is 3. The major radius is 6, so the center of the generating circle is 6 units away from the axis.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of the sphere's center. Let's assume the sphere is centered at the origin (0,0,0). Then, when the torus is inside the sphere, its center (the center of the generating circle) is at a distance of 6 - 3 = 3 from the sphere's center? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, the major radius is 6, so the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is 6? Or is it different?

Wait, maybe I should sketch a cross-sectional view. Imagine a circle of radius 3, with its center 6 units away from the axis. The torus is then the surface created by rotating this circle around the axis. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6. So in terms of the sphere's center, which is the same as the torus's axis, because when the torus is inside or outside the sphere, it's symmetric about that axis.

Wait, that might not be the case. Let me clarify. The problem says the torus is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle. So the generating circle is in a plane, and the axis is in that same plane, 6 units away from the center of the circle. So when you revolve this circle around the axis, you get the torus.

So, the major radius R is 6, and minor radius r is 3. So the torus is a standard one with major radius 6 and minor radius 3.

Now, the sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, tangent along another circle.

So, the internal tangent case: the torus is inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. The points of tangency must lie on the equator of the sphere, or some other circle. Wait, no, it depends on how the torus is placed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus and sphere mathematically.

The equation of a torus can be written in cylindrical coordinates (r, Î¸
