Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles inside a regular dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, right? So it's a 12-sided polygon, and all sides and angles are equal. The question is about counting all possible rectangles where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

First, I need to visualize this. A regular dodecagon can be inscribed in a circle, and all its vertices lie on the circumference. Each vertex is equally spaced. So, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees. That might come in handy later.

Now, rectangles in a polygon. For a rectangle to exist, opposite sides must be equal and all angles must be 90 degrees. In the context of a regular polygon, this would mean that the sides of the rectangle correspond to chords of the circle that make up the polygon.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, not all sides are the same length when you consider diagonals. The sides are the edges of the polygon, but diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. So, for example, a diagonal connecting two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that skips two vertices, etc.

But for a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal. So, in the dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must correspond to chords of the same length. Also, the sides must be perpendicular to each other. So, the angle between the two chords must be 90 degrees.

Hmm, how do we ensure that two chords are perpendicular in a regular polygon? Well, maybe if the arcs they subtend add up to a quarter of the circle? Or something like that. Let me think.

In a circle, if two chords are perpendicular, then the sum of the angles they subtend at the center is 180 degrees, right? Wait, no, that's for diameters. Wait, actually, if two chords are perpendicular, the sum of their subtended angles is 180 degrees. Is that correct?

Wait, let me think again. If two chords are perpendicular, the angle between them is 90 degrees. But the central angles for each chord can be different. So, perhaps there's a relationship between their central angles that makes the chords perpendicular.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides are parallel if they are separated by the same number of steps. For example, in a dodecagon, sides separated by k steps are parallel.

So, to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides. Each pair is separated by some number of steps, and the angles between the two pairs should be 90 degrees.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides can be thought of as vectors. Each side is a vector from one vertex to the next, with a certain angle. So, if I can find four vectors that form a rectangle, that should work.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of selecting four points that form a rectangle. But the problem states that each side of the rectangle lies on a side or
