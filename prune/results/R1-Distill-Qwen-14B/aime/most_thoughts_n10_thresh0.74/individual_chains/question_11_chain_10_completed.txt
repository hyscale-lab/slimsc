Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression:

\[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]

where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). So, \( z \) lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin.

Hmm, I remember that for complex numbers, when dealing with expressions like \( z + \frac{a}{z} \), where \( |z| = r \), there might be some useful properties or transformations I can use. Maybe using polar form would help here since \( |z| = 4 \) suggests that \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \).

Let me try expressing \( z \) in its polar form. So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), which means \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Substituting these into the expression, I get:

\[(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}\]

Simplify the coefficients:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4 = 300 + 468i \). So, that term becomes \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \). So, that term becomes \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression is:

\[(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\]

I can write this as:

\( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \), where \( A = 300 + 468i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \).

I remember that expressions of the form \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \) can be rewritten using Euler's formula. Let me expand both terms.

First, \( A e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Similarly, \( B e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Let me multiply these out.

Expanding \( A e^{i\theta} \):

\( 300 \cos\theta + 300 i \sin\theta + 468i \cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta \).

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:

\( 300 \cos\theta + (300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta)i - 468 \sin\theta \).

So, combining real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta \).

Imaginary part: \( 300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta \).

Similarly, expanding \( B e^{-i\theta} \):

\( 24 \cos\theta - 24i \sin\theta + 36i \cos\theta - 36i^2 \sin\theta \).

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so this becomes:

\( 24 \cos\theta - 24i \sin\theta + 36i \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta \).

Combining real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta \).

Imaginary part: \( -24 \sin\theta + 36 \cos\theta \).

Now, adding the two expanded expressions together.

Total real part:

\( [300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta] + [24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta] \)

Combine like terms:

\( (300 + 24) \cos\theta + (-468 + 36) \sin\theta \)

Which is:

\( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \)

Similarly, the total imaginary part:

\( [300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta] + [ -24 \sin\theta + 36 \cos\theta ] \)

Combine like terms:

\( (300 - 24) \sin\theta + (468 + 36) \cos\theta \)

Which is:

\( 276 \sin\theta + 504 \cos\theta \)

So the entire expression is:

\( [324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta] + i [276 \sin\theta + 504 \cos\theta] \)

But we are only interested in the real part. So, the real part is:

\( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \)

Let me denote this as \( Re(\theta) = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \). We need to find the maximum value of \( Re(\theta) \).

I remember that an expression of the form \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Alternatively, the maximum value is \( R \). So, in this case, the maximum real part would be the amplitude of this expression.

Wait, but here, the coefficients are 324 and -432. So, the expression is \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \). So, I can write this as \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \), where \( a = 324 \) and \( b = -432 \).

The maximum value of \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). So, the maximum real part would be \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \( 324^2 \):

324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400.

So, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute that.

432 * 432. Break it down: 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2=1,024, and cross term 2*400*32=25,600.

So, 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024.

160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600; 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, the square of the coefficients is 324^2 + (-432)^2 = 104,976 + 186,624.

Adding these together: 104,976 + 186,624.

104,976 + 186,624: 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000; 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600.

So, \( R = \sqrt{291,600} \).

What's the square root of 291,600?

Let me see, 500^2 = 250,000. 540^2 = (500+40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So, \( R = 540 \).

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Because 540^2 is indeed 291,600, so that's correct.

So, the maximum real part of the given expression is 540.

But let me double-check everything I did to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, steps:

1. Expressed \( z = 4 e^{i\theta} \), correct.

2. Computed \( (75 + 117i) * 4 = 300 + 468i \) – correct.

3. Computed \( (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i \) – correct.

4. Expanded both terms into real and imaginary parts, which seems correct.

5. Added real parts and imaginary parts separately.

6. For the real part, ended up with 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

7. Recognized that the maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is sqrt(a² + b²), which is correct.

8. Calculated 324² = 104,976; 432²=186,624; sum is 291,600, sqrt is 540.

Everything seems to check out.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.


The problem requires finding the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). 

Expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), we rewrite the expression:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding both terms and combining like terms, the real part of the expression becomes:

\[
324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta
\]

The maximum value of \(a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Calculating this:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is:

\boxed{540}
