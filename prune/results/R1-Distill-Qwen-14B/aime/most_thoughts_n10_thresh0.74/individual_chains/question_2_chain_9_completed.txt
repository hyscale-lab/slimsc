Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the points given are O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit higher than (0, 0.8). 

The family of segments F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment starting on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis, with length exactly 1. 

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. I'm supposed to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Hmm. So, I need to find point C on AB such that it's only on AB and no other PQ from F. So, it's like the only point where AB crosses all other PQs, except for C. So, C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F?

Wait, maybe I should visualize this. The family F consists of all segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, and PQ = 1. So, if I fix P at (p,0), then Q must be at (0, q) where sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p² + q² = 1. Therefore, for each p in [0,1], Q is (0, sqrt(1 - p²)). So, the segment PQ connects (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)). 

So, the equation of the line PQ can be found for each p. Let me write the equation of PQ for a general p. The line passes through (p,0) and (0, sqrt(1 - p²)). So, the slope is (sqrt(1 - p²) - 0)/(0 - p) = -sqrt(1 - p²)/p.

Thus, the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²). 

So, for each p between 0 and 1, I have a line PQ with that equation. The family F is all these lines for p in (0,1). 

Now, the point C is on AB, and it's the only point on AB that is not on any other PQ except AB itself. So, AB is one of these PQ segments, right? Because A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB. The distance between A and B would be sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of length 1 in F. So, AB is part of the family F. 

So, AB is one of the segments in F. Now, all other segments in F are other PQs. So, the point C is on AB, but it's only on AB and not on any other PQ from F. So, it's like the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. Because the envelope would be the curve that is tangent to each PQ, and if AB is part of F, then the point C would be where AB is tangent to this envelope. So, C is the point of tangency.

Hence, to find C, I need to find the envelope of the family of lines F. 

The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, for each PQ in F, the envelope is tangent to it at some point. So, point C will lie on AB and also be on the envelope, and AB is itself a member of F, so the envelope will touch AB at point C.

So, to find the envelope, I can use the method of finding the envelope of a family of curves. The family of lines is given by F(p) = y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0. Wait, let me write that again. The equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²). Let me rearrange that to standard form: (sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + y - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0.

So, the family is F(p, x, y) = (sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + y - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0.

The envelope satisfies both F(p, x, y) = 0 and ∂F/∂p = 0.

So, let's compute ∂F/∂p.

F(p, x, y) = (sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + y - sqrt(1 - p²) 

So, taking the derivative with respect to p:

dF/dp = [ ( (-2p)/(2 sqrt(1 - p²)) ) / p ) ] x + 0 - [ (-2p)/(2 sqrt(1 - p²)) ]

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First term: d/dp [ sqrt(1 - p²)/p * x ] 

Let me write sqrt(1 - p²) as (1 - p²)^(1/2). 

So, the derivative of sqrt(1 - p²) is (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-1/2) * (-2p) = -p / sqrt(1 - p²).

Then, using the quotient rule for sqrt(1 - p²)/p:

Let me denote f(p) = sqrt(1 - p²), so f’(p) = -p / sqrt(1 - p²).

Then, derivative of f(p)/p is [f’(p) * p - f(p) * 1 ] / p².

So:

[ (-p / sqrt(1 - p²)) * p - sqrt(1 - p²) * 1 ] / p²

= [ (-p² / sqrt(1 - p²)) - sqrt(1 - p²) ] / p²

Let me factor sqrt(1 - p²) in the numerator:

= [ (-p² - (1 - p²)) / sqrt(1 - p²) ] / p²

Simplify numerator:

- p² -1 + p² = -1

So, numerator is (-1)/sqrt(1 - p²)

So, derivative is (-1)/sqrt(1 - p²) / p² = -1 / (p² sqrt(1 - p²))

So, dF/dp for the first term is -1/(p² sqrt(1 - p²)) * x

Second term: derivative of y is 0.

Third term: derivative of -sqrt(1 - p²) is (p)/sqrt(1 - p²)

So, overall, ∂F/∂p = [ -x / (p² sqrt(1 - p²)) ] + [ p / sqrt(1 - p²) ] = 0

So, we have the system:

1. (sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + y - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0
2. (-x)/(p² sqrt(1 - p²)) + p / sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Let me write these equations.

From equation 2: 

(-x)/(p² sqrt(1 - p²)) + p / sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - p²):

(-x)/(p²) + p = 0

=> (-x) + p^3 = 0

=> x = p^3

So, from equation 2, we get x = p^3.

Now, plug this into equation 1:

(sqrt(1 - p²)/p) * p^3 + y - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Simplify:

sqrt(1 - p²) * p² + y - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Factor sqrt(1 - p²):

sqrt(1 - p²)(p² - 1) + y = 0

But p² - 1 = -(1 - p²), so:

- sqrt(1 - p²)(1 - p²) + y = 0

Which is:

y = sqrt(1 - p²) (1 - p²)

So, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

So, from equation 1, we have y = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

So, now, from the envelope equations, we have x = p^3 and y = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

So, the envelope is parametrized by p, with x = p^3 and y = (1 - p²)^(3/2). 

So, to express the envelope in terms of x and y, perhaps we can eliminate p.

Let me see: x = p^3 => p = x^(1/3)

Then, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2)

So, raising both sides to the power of 2/3:

y^(2/3) = (1 - x^(2/3))

Thus, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

So, the envelope is the curve x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

That's a astroid or something similar. So, the envelope is an astroid.

So, now, the point C is on both the envelope and the line AB. So, we need to find the intersection of AB and the envelope x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

First, let's find the equation of AB.

Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3)

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)

So, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

So, equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

Now, we can find the intersection of this line with the envelope curve x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Substitute y from AB into the envelope equation.

So:

x^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1

Let me denote t = x to make it easier.

So:

t^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1

Let me compute the expression inside the second term:

- sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3) ( -t + 1/2 )

So, [ sqrt(3) (-t + 1/2) ]^(2/3)

= [ sqrt(3) ]^(2/3) * [ (-t + 1/2) ]^(2/3)

sqrt(3) is 3^(1/2), so [3^(1/2)]^(2/3) = 3^(1/3)

Similarly, [ (-t + 1/2) ]^(2/3) is [ (1/2 - t) ]^(2/3)

So, the equation becomes:

t^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - t)^(2/3) = 1

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can let u = t^(1/3), so t = u^3, and 1/2 - t = 1/2 - u^3.

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me consider that the point C is on AB and also on the envelope. So, perhaps we can parametrize AB and substitute into the envelope.

Parametrizing AB: since AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), we can write AB as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2) s

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) s

where s ranges from 0 to 1.

So, for s=0, we are at A, s=1 at B.

So, substituting x and y into the envelope equation:

x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = [ (1/2 - (1/2)s ) ]^(2/3) + [ (sqrt(3)/2 s ) ]^(2/3) = 1

Let me compute each term.

First term: [ (1/2)(1 - s) ]^(2/3) = (1/2)^(2/3) * (1 - s)^(2/3)

Second term: [ (sqrt(3)/2 s ) ]^(2/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) * s^(2/3)

So, let me compute (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3):

sqrt(3) = 3^(1/2), so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) = 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3). Because (a^b)^c = a^(b c), so (3^(1/2))^(2/3) = 3^(1/3). Similarly, denominator is 2^(2/3).

Similarly, (1/2)^(2/3) = 2^(-2/3)

So, substituting:

(2^(-2/3))(1 - s)^(2/3) + (3^(1/3)/2^(2/3)) s^(2/3) = 1

Multiply both sides by 2^(2/3):

(2^(-2/3) * 2^(2/3))(1 - s)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) s^(2/3) = 2^(2/3)

Simplify the first term:

2^(-2/3 + 2/3) = 2^0 = 1

So, equation becomes:

(1 - s)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) s^(2/3) = 2^(2/3)

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me denote u = s^(1/3). So, s = u^3, and 1 - s = 1 - u^3.

So, substituting:

(1 - u^3)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) u^2 = 2^(2/3)

Wait, (1 - u^3)^(2/3) is [ (1 - u)(1 + u + u^2) ]^(2/3). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps let me write t = s^(1/3), so s = t^3.

But maybe another approach. Let me let v = s^(2/3). So, s = v^(3/2). Then, 1 - s = 1 - v^(3/2).

But not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to let t = s^(1/3), so s = t^3, and then 1 - s = 1 - t^3.

So, equation becomes:

(1 - t^3)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) t^2 = 2^(2/3)

Hmm, perhaps we can write (1 - t^3)^(2/3) as [ (1 - t)(1 + t + t^2) ]^(2/3). Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can raise both sides to the power of 3 to eliminate the 2/3 exponents. But that might complicate things because of the sum.

Wait, let me see:

Let me denote A = (1 - s)^(2/3), B = 3^(1/3) s^(2/3)

So, A + B = 2^(2/3)

Let me cube both sides:

(A + B)^3 = (2^(2/3))^3 = 2^2 = 4

Expanding (A + B)^3:

A^3 + B^3 + 3 A^2 B + 3 A B^2 = 4

Compute each term.

A^3 = [ (1 - s)^(2/3) ]^3 = (1 - s)^2

B^3 = [ (3^(1/3) s^(2/3) ) ]^3 = 3 s^2

Similarly, 3 A^2 B = 3 [ (1 - s)^(2/3) ]^2 * 3^(1/3) s^(2/3) = 3 * (1 - s)^(4/3) * 3^(1/3) s^(2/3)

= 3^(4/3) * (1 - s)^(4/3) s^(2/3) 

And 3 A B^2 = 3 [ (1 - s)^(2/3) ] * [3^(1/3) s^(2/3)]^2 = 3 * (1 - s)^(2/3) * 3^(2/3) s^(4/3)

= 3^(5/3) (1 - s)^(2/3) s^(4/3)

So, putting all together:

(1 - s)^2 + 3 s^2 + 3^(4/3) (1 - s)^(4/3) s^(2/3) + 3^(5/3) (1 - s)^(2/3) s^(4/3) = 4

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, let me think. Since the point C is unique on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F, it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope. So, perhaps instead of solving for the intersection, I can find where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Wait, but AB is itself a member of F, so the envelope is tangent to AB at point C.

So, perhaps the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Alternatively, maybe since we know AB is a member of F, the envelope is tangent to AB at C.

So, perhaps the parametrization gives us point C as the point on AB where the envelope is tangent to AB.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize AB as above and set it equal to the envelope.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the point C is where AB is the only PQ that passes through it, meaning that at point C, AB has the unique PQ that passes through it. So, perhaps the point C is such that AB is the only PQ in F that passes through it. Hence, C lies on AB and on the envelope, and it's the only such point.

So, since we've parametrized AB as x = 1/2 - (1/2) s, y = (sqrt(3)/2) s, and substituted into the envelope equation, leading to:

(1 - s)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) s^(2/3) = 2^(2/3)

Let me try to solve this equation for s.

Let me denote u = s^(1/3), so s = u^3. Then, 1 - s = 1 - u^3.

So, substituting:

(1 - u^3)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) u^2 = 2^(2/3)

Hmm, perhaps this substitution will help. Let me compute (1 - u^3)^(2/3):

(1 - u^3)^(2/3) = [ (1 - u)(1 + u + u^2) ]^(2/3) = (1 - u)^(2/3) (1 + u + u^2)^(2/3)

Not sure.

Wait, let me take both sides to the power of 3:

[ (1 - u^3)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) u^2 ]^3 = (2^(2/3))^3 = 4

But expanding that would be messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an inspired guess for u.

Let me suppose that u is something that makes (1 - u^3)^(2/3) and 3^(1/3) u^2 nice.

Let me try u=1/2.

Compute (1 - (1/2)^3)^(2/3) = (1 - 1/8)^(2/3) = (7/8)^(2/3) ≈ (0.875)^(0.666) ≈ 0.875^(2/3). Hmm, not a nice number.

Alternatively, let me try u= (something that relates to 3^(1/3)).

Wait, 3^(1/3) is about 1.442.

Alternatively, perhaps u=1.

At u=1: (1 -1 )^(2/3)=0, and 3^(1/3)(1)^2 = 3^(1/3) ≈1.442, which is less than 2^(2/3)≈1.587. So sum is 1.442 <1.587. So, sum is less than RHS.

At u=0: 1^(2/3)=1, and 0. So, sum is 1, which is less than 1.587.

Wait, perhaps try u= (something else). Maybe u= (2^(2/3) - something)/something.

Wait, perhaps try u= 2^(2/3)/3^(1/3). Let's compute 2^(2/3) is approx 1.587, 3^(1/3) is approx1.442. So, u≈1.587 /1.442≈1.10.

But u=1.10 would be s= u^3≈1.331, which is more than 1, but s can't be more than 1 since it's along AB from A to B.

So, u must be less than or equal to1, since s ranges from 0 to1.

So perhaps u= 1/ something.

Wait, let me think. Maybe u= 3^(1/3)/2^(2/3). Let me compute that.

3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3) = (3/4)^(1/3) ≈ (0.75)^(0.333)≈0.913.

So, u≈0.913.

Compute (1 - u^3)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) u^2.

First, u^3= (3/4)^(1) = 3/4.

So, 1 - u^3=1 -3/4=1/4.

(1/4)^(2/3)= (1/4)^(2/3)= (4)^(-2/3)= (2^2)^(-2/3)=2^(-4/3)=1/(2^(4/3))≈1/2.519≈0.396.

Next term:3^(1/3) u^2 =3^(1/3)*(3/4)^(2/3)=3^(1/3)*(9/16)^(1/3)= [3*(9/16)]^(1/3)= (27/16)^(1/3)= (27)^(1/3)/(16)^(1/3)=3/(2.519)≈1.19.

Adding both terms: 0.396 +1.19≈1.586, which is approximately 2^(2/3)= approx1.587. So, that's very close. So, u= (3/4)^(1/3) is a solution.

Thus, u= (3/4)^(1/3). Therefore, s= u^3=3/4.

So, s=3/4.

So, the coordinates of point C are:

x=1/2 - (1/2)s=1/2 - (1/2)(3/4)=1/2 -3/8=1/8

y= sqrt(3)/2 * s= sqrt(3)/2 *3/4= (3 sqrt(3))/8

So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

Therefore, OC is the distance from O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

OC²= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2=1/64 + (27)/64=(1 +27)/64=28/64=7/16.

Thus, OC²=7/16. So, p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

OC^2: (1/8)^2 =1/64, (3√3/8)^2=9*3 /64=27/64.

1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16. Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.


To solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments \( \overline{PQ} \) with unit length, where \( P \) lies on the \( x \)-axis and \( Q \) on the \( y \)-axis. The equation of each segment \( \overline{PQ} \) is derived, and we find that the family of lines can be expressed as:

\[
F(p, x, y) = \frac{\sqrt{1 - p^2}}{p}x + y - \sqrt{1 - p^2} = 0
\]

To find the envelope of this family, we compute the partial derivative with respect to \( p \) and solve the system of equations \( F(p, x, y) = 0 \) and \( \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} = 0 \). This leads to the parametrization of the envelope as:

\[
x = p^3, \quad y = (1 - p^2)^{3/2}
\]

Eliminating \( p \), we find the envelope is given by:

\[
x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1
\]

Next, we determine the equation of line \( AB \), which is found to be:

\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Substituting this into the envelope equation, we solve for the intersection point \( C \) on \( AB \). After some algebraic manipulation and substitution, we find that the coordinates of \( C \) are:

\[
C\left( \frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)
\]

Calculating \( OC^2 \), the square of the distance from the origin to \( C \):

\[
OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}
\]

Thus, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is \( 7 + 16 = 23 \).

\[
\boxed{23}
\]
