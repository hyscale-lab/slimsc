Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. But not sure if that's directly useful yet.

The problem is about rectangles whose sides lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So each side of the rectangle must align with either a side of the dodecagon or a diagonal.

I think I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon. Each vertex can be connected to others, forming various diagonals, and some of these diagonals will be longer than others. The key is that a rectangle is formed by two pairs of parallel sides. So, in the context of a regular dodecagon, opposite sides of the rectangle must be parallel and equal in length.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, sides are all the same length, but the diagonals can have different lengths. So, for a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines (either sides or diagonals) that intersect to form a rectangle.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there are multiple axes of symmetry. For a dodecagon, the number of axes of symmetry is 12: 6 through opposite vertices and 6 through midpoints of opposite sides.

But how does this help with counting rectangles?

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of selecting pairs of parallel lines and then seeing if their intersections form rectangles.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. For example, in a regular polygon, a diagonal can be defined by the step between vertices. So, in a dodecagon, each vertex connects to 9 others (since you can't connect to itself or its two adjacent vertices). So, the steps can be 2,3,4,5,6, etc., up to 5 because beyond that, they mirror.

Wait, no, actually, the number of steps between connected vertices defines the diagonal. For a regular polygon with n sides, the diagonals can be categorized by the step k, where k is between 2 and floor(n/2). So for a dodecagon, n=12, so k can be 2,3,4,5,6.

But wait, when k=6, that's the diameter, connecting opposite vertices. So, for each step k, you can have diagonals of different lengths.

So, perhaps the sides of the rectangles are either sides (k=1) or diagonals (k=2 to 6). But in a dodecagon, sides are only of step k=1, and diagon
