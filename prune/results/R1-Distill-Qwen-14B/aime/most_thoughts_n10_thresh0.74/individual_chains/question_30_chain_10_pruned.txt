Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000. Here, \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity and not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, so let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \(\omega^n = 1\) for some integer n. In this case, since it's a 13th root, \(\omega^{13} = 1\). Also, since \(\omega \neq 1\), it's one of the primitive roots.

The product is from k=0 to 12, which covers all the 13th roots of unity. So, each term in the product corresponds to a different root.

Looking at the expression inside the product: \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Maybe I can simplify this expression first. Let me factor out a 2: \(2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}\). Hmm, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it in terms of \(\omega^{k}\) and see if it's a geometric series or relates to any known identity.

Wait, another thought: since \(\omega\) is a root of unity, \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a root of unity, specifically a 13th root as well. Maybe I can consider substituting \(x = \omega^k\), so each term becomes \(2 - 2x + x^2\). Then, the product becomes \(\prod_{x^{13}=1, x \neq 1} (2 - 2x + x^2)\). Wait, but actually, when k=0, \(\omega^0 = 1\), so when k=0, the term is \(2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1\). So the term at k=0 is 1. So the product is really from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Wait, so maybe I should adjust the product to exclude k=0? Because when k=0, it's 1, which doesn't affect the product. So maybe the product is the same as \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\).

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the whole product from k=0 to 12, which includes 1, so it's the same as \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \times \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\).

So, how can I compute this product? Maybe I
