Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p + q.

Hmm, first, let me visualize the problem. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length (let's say x), width (y), and height (z). The surface area of a box is 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume is xyz. So we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27
2. xyz = 23

We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's diameter must be equal to the space diagonal of the box because that's the longest distance within the box. So the radius would be half of that space diagonal.

The space diagonal D of a box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r is D/2, so r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, to find r², I need to find the minimum value of (x² + y² + z²)/4 over all possible boxes in set B.

Wait, but how do I find the minimum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume?

This feels like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that we can use Lagrange multipliers for optimization with constraints, but maybe there's a simpler way using inequalities.

Let me recall that for positive real numbers x, y, z, the following inequality holds: x² + y² + z² ≥ (xy + yz + zx). But wait, in our case, xy + yz + zx is 27, so x² + y² + z² ≥ 27. But that's just a lower bound. However, equality holds when x = y = z, but in our case, if x = y = z, then it's a cube, but let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area is 6x² = 54 ⇒ x² = 9 ⇒ x = 3. Then volume would be x³ = 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So the box is not a cube; it's a rectangular prism with different dimensions.

So, the minimal x² + y² + z² is greater than 27. Hmm, so how do I find the minimal x² + y² + z² given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23?

I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Let me set up the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27
h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

Wait, but with two constraints, I might need to use two Lagrange multipliers. Hmm, perhaps that's the way to go.

The method says that at the extremum, the gradient of f is a linear combination of the gradients of g and h. So:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h

Calculating the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)
∇g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)
∇h = (yz, xz, xy)

So, setting up the equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)  ...(1)
2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)  ...(2)
2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)  ...(3)

And we also have the constraints:

xy + yz + zx = 27  ...(4)
xyz = 23  ...(5)

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can assume some symmetry. For example, perhaps two variables are equal? Let's suppose that x = y. If that's the case, then maybe the problem becomes easier.

Let me assume x = y. Then, equations (1) and (2) become the same.

So, if x = y, then let's denote x = y = a, and z = b.

Then, our constraints become:

Equation (4): a² + 2ab = 27
Equation (5): a² b = 23

Our function to minimize becomes 2a² + b².

So, let's express b from equation (5): a² b = 23 ⇒ b = 23 / a².

Substituting into equation (4): a² + 2a*(23/a²) = 27 ⇒ a² + (46 / a) = 27.

Multiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator: a³ + 46 = 27a ⇒ a³ -27a +46 =0.

Hmm, I need to solve this cubic equation: a³ -27a +46 =0.

Let me check if it has any integer roots. Let's test a=3: 27 -81 +46= -8 ≠0. a=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, a=2 is a root.

So, (a-2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide a³ -27a +46 by (a - 2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23   0

So, the cubic factors as (a - 2)(a² + 2a -23) =0.

Set each factor to zero:

a -2=0 ⇒ a=2.

a² + 2a -23=0 ⇒ a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] / 2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since a is positive, a = -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let's compute that: sqrt(6)≈2.449, so 2*sqrt(6)≈4.898. So, a≈-1 +4.898≈3.898. Hmm, seems reasonable.

So, possible values for a are 2 and -1 + 2√6.

Let me test a=2 first.

If a=2, then from equation (5): b =23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

Then, the function x² + y² + z² = 2a² + b² = 2*(4) + (23/4)²=8 + (529/16)= (128/16)+(529/16)=657/16=41.0625.

So, r²= (41.0625)/4≈10.265625.

But let's also check the other root, a = -1 + 2√6 ≈3.898.

Compute a²: (-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6.

Wait, let me compute that step by step:

(-1 + 2√6)^2 = (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2√6) =1 + 24 -4√6=25 -4√6.

So, a²=25 -4√6.

Then, b=23/(a²)=23/(25 -4√6). Let's rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

b=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529 =1/23, since 529=23².

So, b=(25 +4√6)/23.

Now, compute 2a² + b²:

2a² =2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

b²= [(25 +4√6)/23]^2 = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529 = (721 + 200√6)/529.

So, adding 2a² + b²:

50 -8√6 + (721 + 200√6)/529.

Let me convert 50 into 50*529/529 = 26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6 = -8√6 *529/529 = (-4232√6)/529.

So, adding all terms:

(26450/529) + (-4232√6 /529) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Combine numerators:

26450 +721 =27171.

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4032√6).

So, total is (27171 -4032√6)/529.

So, x² + y² + z² = (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hence, r² = (27171 -4032√6)/(4 *529) = (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me compute the numerical value to compare with the a=2 case.

Compute 27171 ≈27171, 4032√6≈4032*2.449≈4032*2.449≈Let me compute 4000*2.449=9796, and 32*2.449≈78.368, so total≈9796 +78.368≈9874.368.

So, 27171 -9874
