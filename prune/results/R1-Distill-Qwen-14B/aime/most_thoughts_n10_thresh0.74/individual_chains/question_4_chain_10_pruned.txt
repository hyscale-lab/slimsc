Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. The rules are they take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob has a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, alright, so first, I remember that in such games, it's often useful to look for patterns or periodicity in the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming both players play optimally.

Let me try to approach this step by step. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there's at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

So, starting from n=0. If there are 0 tokens left, the game is over, so the player who is supposed to move loses. So n=0 is a losing position.

Wait, but in the game, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=0, the previous player has taken the last token, so the current player loses. So n=0 is indeed a losing position.

Now, let's build up the positions from n=1 onwards.

n=1:
- Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position (W).

n=2:
- Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take 1 and win. Wait, no, because if Alice takes 1, n=1, Bob's turn. Bob can take 1 and win. So if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. But wait, Alice can also take 4 tokens, but n=2, she can't. So she can only take 1. So n=2, Alice can only move to n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So n=2 is a losing position (L) for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, if n=2 is the current position, and it's Alice's turn. She can take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob. Bob can then
