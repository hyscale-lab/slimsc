Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step. 

First, the hyperbola equation is given as (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along x, and the conjugate along y.

Then, we have points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me recall: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So they intersect at 90 degrees.

So, the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, and all four vertices lie on the hyperbola.

The question is asking for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD², or perhaps the maximum lower bound of BD².

Wait, no, the wording is a bit different. It says, "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that would be the supremum of the lower bounds. So, like, the maximum value that is still less than or equal to BD² for all possible rhombi. Hmm, actually, maybe the infimum of BD²? Wait, no, if we’re looking for the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, that would be the maximum lower bound, which is the infimum. So, we need to find the minimal possible BD², but phrased as the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think
