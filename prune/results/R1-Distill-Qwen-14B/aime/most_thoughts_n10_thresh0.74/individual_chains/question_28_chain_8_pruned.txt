Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are both √80, and BC and AD are both √89. I need to find the distance from the incenter (which is the point inside the tetrahedron equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer needs to be in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (which is the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula similar to the inradius in a triangle, but extended into three dimensions. The formula is:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, how do I find the volume? Maybe I can use coordinates. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices A, B, C, D in such a way that the given edge lengths are satisfied, then I can compute the volume with the scalar triple product.

Let me try setting up a coordinate system. Let me place point A at (0, 0, 0) to simplify things. Then, I can position other points relative to A.

Looking at the edge lengths:

AB = √41, AC = √80, AD = √89.

So, if A is at (0,0,0), let me assign coordinates to B, C, D such that the distances from A to these points are √41, √80, √89 respectively.

Wait, but actually, since the opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of "equilateral" tetrahedron, but with edges in pairs equal.

Let me think: AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC. So, all opposite edges are equal. That suggests that the tetrahedron is "isohedral" or something? I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tetrahedron that can be inscribed in a rectangular box. I remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be embedded in a box such that each vertex is at a corner of the box, and the edges correspond to face diagonals.

So, let's try that approach. Let me assign coordinates to A, B, C, D as follows:

Let’s suppose that the tetrahedron is embedded in a box with sides a, b, c. Then, the vertices can be placed at (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c). But in our case, the edges between the points are given, so I need to match the edge lengths to the given distances.

Wait, in that case, the edge AB would be the distance between A=(0,0,0) and B=(a,0,0), which is a. Similarly, AC would be the distance between A and (0,b,0), which is b, and AD would be the distance between A and (0,0,c), which is c.

But in our problem, AB=√41, AC=√80, AD=√89. So, that suggests that a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

Wait, but then what are the other edges?

For example, BC would be the distance between B=(a,0,0) and C=(0,b,0), which is sqrt(a² + b²).

Similarly, BD would be the distance between B=(a,0,0) and D=(0,0,c), which is sqrt(a² + c²).

And CD would be the distance between C=(0,b,0) and D=(0,0,c), which is sqrt(b² + c²).

Wait, let me check:

AB distance: a = √41
AC distance: b = √80
AD distance: c = √89

Then, BC = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41 + 80) = sqrt(121) = 11

BD = sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(41 + 89) = sqrt(130)

CD = sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(80 + 89) = sqrt(169) = 13

Wait, but in the
