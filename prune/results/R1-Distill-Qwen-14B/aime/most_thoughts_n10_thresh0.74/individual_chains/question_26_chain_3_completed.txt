Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. That means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. So, D is the intersection of the two tangents. From point A, we draw line AD, which intersects ω again at point P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle ω.

Given lengths are AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, it's definitely a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle passing through all three points.

Point D is where the two tangents at B and C meet. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. Also, in such cases, the line from D to the center of the circle is the angle bisector of angle BDC.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me jot down the key points:

1. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.
2. ω is the circumcircle of ABC.
3. Tangents at B and C meet at D.
4. AD intersects ω again at P.
5. Find AP as a reduced fraction m/n, then m + n.

So, I need to find the length AP. Let me think about properties related to tangents and power of a point.

First, since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, by the Power of a Point theorem, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². So, DB = DC.

Wait, is that correct? The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside the circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the power. So, yes, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

That's a useful piece of information.

Now, since AD intersects ω again at P, perhaps there are some similar triangles or other circle theorems that can be applied here.

Wait, maybe using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.

Alternatively, maybe coordinate geometry could be an approach. Assign coordinates to points A, B, C, compute the necessary equations, find point D, then find the equation of line AD, find its intersection P with the circumcircle ω, and then compute the distance AP.

But that seems computational. Alternatively, maybe using inversion? Hmm, perhaps, but inversion might be a bit overkill.

Wait, let's think about the properties of point D. Since D is the ex-pole of BC, and the line AD intersects the circle again at P, perhaps there's a harmonic bundle or something like that.

Alternatively, I can compute coordinates. Let me try that approach.

First, I need to assign coordinate system to triangle ABC. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC is 10 units. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. Given AB =5, BC=9, so we can compute the coordinates of B.

Let me set up the coordinate system:

Let’s set point C at (0,0), point A at (10,0). Then, point B is somewhere in the plane such that AB =5 and BC=9.

So, the coordinates of B can be found using the distance formula.

Let me denote point B as (x,y). Then, distance from B to C is 9:

√(x² + y²) = 9 => x² + y² = 81. (1)

Distance from B to A is 5:

√((x-10)² + y²) =5 => (x-10)² + y² =25. (2)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(x-10)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 -81 =>

Expanding (x-10)^2: x² -20x +100 + y² -x² - y² = -56 =>

-20x +100 = -56 =>

-20x = -156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Now, substitute back into equation (1):

(39/5)^2 + y² =81.

Compute (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521, 5^2=25, so 1521/25.

Thus, y² =81 - 1521/25.

Convert 81 to 2025/25. So,

y² = 2025/25 -1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25.

So, y = ±√(504/25) = ±(√504)/5. Let's compute √504.

504 factors: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not helpful.

Wait, 504 divided by 4 is 126, which is 9*14. So, 504 = 4*9*14 = 4*9*2*7. So, √504 = √(4*9*14) = 2*3*√14 =6√14.

Thus, y = ±6√14 /5. Since in the Asymptote code, point B is drawn at (7.8, 4.4899), which is approximately 4.49, which is positive. So, we'll take y =6√14/5.

So, coordinates of B are (39/5, 6√14/5).

So now, points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Now, I need to find the tangents at B and C to circle ω. Their intersection is point D.

First, I need to find the equation of the circle ω, the circumcircle of triangle ABC.

We can find the circumcircle equation using the coordinates of A, B, C.

Alternatively, since points A, B, C are known, we can compute the circumradius and the center.

Let me compute the circumcircle equation.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Since point C is (0,0), substituting into the equation gives 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F =0 => F=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey =0.

Now, substitute point A(10,0):

10² +0² + D*10 + E*0 =0 => 100 +10D =0 => 10D = -100 => D= -10.

So, equation becomes x² + y² -10x + Ey =0.

Now, substitute point B(39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) =0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

-10*(39/5) = -78.

So, putting it all together:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6√14/5) E =0.

Sum 1521/25 +504/25 = 2025/25 =81.

So, equation becomes:

81 -78 + (6√14/5) E =0.

So, 3 + (6√14/5) E =0 => (6√14/5) E = -3 => E = (-3)*(5)/(6√14) )= (-15)/(6√14) = (-5)/(2√14).

Rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

E= (-5√14)/(2*14)= (-5√14)/28.

So, the equation of the circle is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Alternatively, x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should compute the center and radius.

The center of the circle is at ( -D/2, -E/2 ). From the equation x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0, the center is (-D/2, -E/2).

From the equation, D= -10, E= -5√14/28.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in our equation, it's x² + y² -10x + Ey =0, so D= -10, E= E.

So, center is at ( -D/2, -E/2 ) = (10/2, -E/2 ) = (5, -E/2 ).

Since E is the coefficient, which is (-5√14/28). So, E is negative.

So, -E/2 = (5√14/28)/2 = 5√14/56.

Wait, no: E is in the equation as Ey, so E is the coefficient. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the standard form, the equation is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0. So, in our case, we have x² + y² -10x + Ey =0.

So, D= -10, E= E, and F=0.

So, the center is at ( -D/2, -E/2 ) = (10/2, -E/2 )= (5, -E/2 ).

So, substituting E= (-5√14)/28.

Wait, no. Wait, E in the equation is the coefficient, which we found to be -5√14 /28. So, E= -5√14/28.

So, -E/2 = (5√14/28)/2 = 5√14/(56).

So, the center is at (5, 5√14/56).

Hmm, that seems a small y-coordinate. Let me check calculations again.

Wait, point B is (39/5, 6√14/5). Let me recalculate the equation.

Wait, when I substituted point B into the equation, I think I might have made an error in the calculation.

Wait, the equation is x² + y² -10x + Ey =0.

Point B: x =39/5, y=6√14/5.

So, (39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) =0.

Compute (39/5)^2: 1521/25.

(6√14/5)^2: (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

-10*(39/5) = -78.

So, 1521/25 +504/25 = (1521 +504)/25 = 2025/25=81.

So, 81 -78 + (6√14/5) E =0.

So, 3 + (6√14/5) E =0 => (6√14/5) E =-3 => E= (-3)*(5)/(6√14)= (-15)/(6√14)= (-5)/(2√14).

So, E= -5/(2√14). Rationalizing, E= (-5√14)/(2*14)= (-5√14)/28.

So, E= -5√14/28.

So, the center is at (5, -E/2 )= (5, (5√14/28)/2 )= (5, 5√14/56).

So, center O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Hmm, that's correct. So, the center is at (5, 5√14/56).

Now, to find the tangents at B and C. Point C is (0,0), point B is (39/5, 6√14/5).

The tangent at a point on a circle can be found using the formula:

For a circle with center (h,k), the tangent at point (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r². Wait, no, that's the equation for the circle. Wait, the equation of the tangent line at (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r².

Wait, actually, no. The standard equation is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r², but that's for the circle itself. For the tangent line at (x1,y1), the equation is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r².

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing it. The correct formula for the tangent line at (x1,y1) on the circle with center (h,k) is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r².

But actually, that's not correct. The correct equation is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r².

Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle. The tangent line at (x1,y1) is given by:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r².

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The tangent line at (x1,y1) is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the slope of the radius is (y1 - k)/(x1 - h). Therefore, the slope of the tangent line is the negative reciprocal of that, which is -(x1 - h)/(y1 - k).

Alternatively, using point-slope form, but since the equation is a bit messy, perhaps it's easier to find the equation of the tangent using the condition that the distance from the center to the line is equal to the radius.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, let's find the equation of the tangent at C, which is (0,0).

The center is at (5, 5√14/56). So, the radius OC is the distance from O to C, which is sqrt( (5 -0)^2 + (5√14/56 -0)^2 ).

But perhaps I can use the fact that the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

The slope of OC is (5√14/56)/5 = √14/(56).

So, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal, which is -56/√14 = -56√14 /14 = -4√14.

So, the equation of the tangent at C is y = -4√14 x + 0, since it passes through (0,0).

Similarly, let's find the equation of the tangent at B.

Point B is (39/5, 6√14/5). The slope of OB is (6√14/5 - 5√14/56)/(39/5 -5).

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 6√14/5 - 5√14/56.

Find a common denominator, which is 280.

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280= 336√14/280.

5√14/56= (5√14 *5)/280=25√14/280.

So, numerator: 336√14/280 -25√14/280= (311√14)/280.

Denominator: 39/5 -5= 39/5 -25/5=14/5.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5)= (311√14/280)*(5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 311√14/784.

Wait, 3920 ÷5=784, 1555 ÷5=311.

So, slope of OB is (311√14)/784.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311√14).

We can rationalize that:

-784/(311√14) = (-784√14)/(311*14) = (-784√14)/(4354).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 784 ÷14=56, 4354 ÷14=311.

Wait, 4354 ÷14: 14*311=4354. Yes.

So, slope simplifies to (-56√14)/311.

So, the equation of the tangent at B is:

y - y_B = m*(x - x_B)

Where m= (-56√14)/311, x_B=39/5, y_B=6√14/5.

So,

y - 6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5).

Now, we have two tangent lines: one at C is y= -4√14 x, and the other at B is y= (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

We can find point D by solving these two equations.

So, set y= -4√14 x into the equation of the tangent at B:

-4√14 x = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

Let me write this equation:

-4√14 x = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5) + (6√14)/5.

Let me divide both sides by √14 to simplify:

-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.

So,

-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.

Let me multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) +6/5 *311.

Compute each term:

Left side: -1244x.

First term on right: -56x + (56*39)/(5) = -56x + (2184)/5.

Second term on right: (6*311)/5 = 1866/5.

So, combining the right side:

-56x + 2184/5 + 1866/5 = -56x + (2184 +1866)/5 = -56x + 4050/5= -56x +810.

So, the equation becomes:

-1244x = -56x +810.

Bring all terms to left:

-1244x +56x -810 =0 => -1188x -810=0 => -1188x =810 => x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.

Simplify the fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 9:

-90/132. Again, divide by 6: -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Now, substitute x into y= -4√14 x:

y= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we have point A at (10,0), point D at (-15/22,30√14/11). We need to find the equation of line AD.

First, compute the slope of AD.

Slope m_AD= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D -x_A)= (30√14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 )= (30√14/11)/( (-15/22 -220/22 ))= (30√14/11)/( (-235/22 )).

Simplify:

(30√14/11) * (22/-235)= (30√14 *22)/(11*(-235)).

Simplify 22/11=2: 30√14 *2 / (-235)= 60√14 / (-235)= -60√14/235.

Simplify numerator and denominator by 5: -12√14/47.

So, slope m_AD= -12√14/47.

So, the equation of line AD is:

y -0 = (-12√14/47)(x -10).

So, y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14/47).

Now, we need to find point P where AD intersects the circumcircle ω again.

We have the equation of ω: x² + y² -10x + Ey=0, where E= -5√14/28.

So, E= -5√14/28.

Wait, I already have the equation of the circle: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

So, equation of circle: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Now, substitute y from line AD into the circle's equation.

So, y= (-12√14/47)x + 120√14/47.

Let me plug this into the circle equation:

x² + [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ]² -10x - (5√14/28)[ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ] =0.

This seems a bit messy, but let's proceed step by step.

First, compute y²:

y² = [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ]².

Let me factor out √14/47:

= [ (√14/47)(-12x +120) ]² = (14/47²)(-12x +120)^2.

So, y² =14*( (-12x +120)^2 ) / (47²).

Similarly, the term (5√14/28)y:

= (5√14/28)* [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ]

=5√14/28 * √14/47*(-12x +120)

=5*14/28/47*(-12x +120)

= (70)/(28*47)*(-12x +120)

= (5)/(2*47)*(-12x +120)

= (5*(-12x +120))/(94).

So, let's now write the circle equation with substitutions:

x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0 becomes:

x² + [14*(-12x +120)^2 / (47²)] -10x - [5*(-12x +120)/94] =0.

Let me rewrite each term:

Term 1: x².

Term 2: 14*(144x² - 2880x + 14400)/ (47²).

Wait, wait, (-12x +120)^2 = (144x² - 2880x + 14400). So,

Term 2: 14*(144x² -2880x +14400)/(47²).

Term 3: -10x.

Term 4: - [5*(-12x +120)/94] = [5*(12x -120)]/94 = (60x -600)/94.

So, putting all together:

x² + [14*(144x² -2880x +14400)]/(47²) -10x + (60x -600)/94 =0.

Let me compute each term:

First, compute 14*(144x² -2880x +14400):

14*144x²=2016x².

14*(-2880x)= -40320x.

14*14400=201600.

So, Term 2 numerator: 2016x² -40320x +201600.

Denominator: 47²=2209.

So, Term2= (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209.

Term3: -10x.

Term4: (60x -600)/94.

So, the equation is:

x² + (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209 -10x + (60x -600)/94 =0.

To combine these terms, let me find a common denominator. 2209 is 47², and 94=2*47. So, the least common denominator is 2209 *2=4418.

So, multiply each term by 4418 to eliminate denominators:

4418*x² + (2016x² -40320x +201600)*2 -10x*4418 + (60x -600)*47 =0.

Compute each term:

Term1: 4418x².

Term2: 2*(2016x² -40320x +201600) =4032x² -80640x +403200.

Term3: -10x *4418= -44180x.

Term4: 47*(60x -600)=2820x -28200.

Now, combine all terms:

4418x² +4032x² -80640x +403200 -44180x +2820x -28200=0.

Combine like terms:

x² terms:4418+4032=8450.

x terms: -80640x -44180x +2820x= (-80640 -44180 +2820)x= (-124820)x.

Constants:403200 -28200=375000.

So, equation becomes:

8450x² -124820x +375000=0.

Simplify this quadratic equation.

First, let's see if we can factor out a common factor. Let's see:

8450, 124820, 375000.

Divide each by 10: 845, 12482, 37500.

845: factors 5*169=5*13².

12482: Let's see, 12482 ÷2=6241, which is 79²? 79*79=6241. So, 12482=2*79².

37500= 375*100=25*15*100=25*15*100=25*1500.

Wait, perhaps no common factor. Let me check GCD of 845, 12482,37500.

Compute GCD of 845 and 12482.

12482 ÷845= 14.75... So, 845*14=11830. 12482-11830=652.

Now, GCD(845,652). 845 ÷652=1 rem 193.

GCD(652,193). 652 ÷193=3 rem 73.

GCD(193,73). 193 ÷73=2 rem 47.

GCD(73,47). 73 ÷47=1 rem26.

GCD(47,26). 47 ÷26=1 rem21.

GCD(26,21). 26 ÷21=1 rem5.

GCD(21,5). 21 ÷5=4 rem1.

GCD(5,1)=1.

So, GCD is 1. So, no common factor besides 1. So, the quadratic is 8450x² -124820x +375000=0.

Let me write it as:

8450x² -124820x +375000 =0.

We can divide all terms by 10 to make it simpler:

845x² -12482x +37500=0.

Let me check if I can divide further. Let's see:

845: 5*169=5*13².

12482: 2*79².

37500: 2^2*3*5^4.

No common factors beyond what we've already done.

So, let's apply quadratic formula:

x = [12482 ±√(12482² -4*845*37500)]/(2*845).

Compute discriminant D:

D=12482² -4*845*37500.

Compute 12482²:

12482*12482. Let's compute this step by step.

Compute 12000²=144,000,000.

Compute 482²=232,324.

Compute 2*12000*482=2*12000=24000*482=24000*400=9,600,000; 24000*82=1,968,000. So, total 9,600,000 +1,968,000=11,568,000.

So, (a +b)^2= a² +2ab +b².

Thus, 12482²= (12000 +482)^2=12000² +2*12000*482 +482²=144,000,000 +11,568,000 +232,324=144,000,000 +11,568,000=155,568,000 +232,324=155,800,324.

Now, compute 4*845*37500=4*845=3380; 3380*37500.

Compute 3380*37500:

3380 *37500=3380*(3.75*10^4)=3380*3.75*10^4.

Compute 3380*3.75:

3.75=15/4, so 3380*(15/4)= (3380/4)*15=845*15=12,675.

So, 12,675 *10^4=126,750,000.

So, D=155,800,324 -126,750,000=29,050,324.

Now, compute square root of D: √29,050,324.

Let me see, 5,000²=25,000,000; 6,000²=36,000,000. So, sqrt is between 5,000 and 6,000.

Let me try 5,400²=29,160,000. Hmm, 5,400²=29,160,000 which is higher than 29,050,324.

So, try 5,390²: compute 5,390².

5,390² = (5,400 -10)^2=5,400² -2*5,400*10 +10²=29,160,000 -108,000 +100=29,052,100.

Hmm, 29,052,100. Our D is 29,050,324, which is 29,052,100 -1,776=29,050,324.

So, 5,390²=29,052,100.

So, D=29,050,324=29,052,100 -1,776=(5,390)^2 - (42)^2= (5,390 -42)(5,390 +42)=5,348*5,432?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe 5,390 - something.

Wait, 5,390²=29,052,100.

Our D is 29,050,324, which is 29,052,100 -1,776. So, 5,390² -1,776.

But perhaps it's better to note that 5,390 - x squared is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the square root is 5,390 - something.

But perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check the discriminant again.

Wait, D=12482² -4*845*37500=155,800,324 -126,750,000=29,050,324.

Hmm, 5,390²=29,052,100 as before. So, 29,050,324 is 1,776 less than 5,390². Let me see, 5,390 - x squared:

Let me compute 5,390²=29,052,100.

So, 29,052,100 -29,050,324=1,776.

So, D=5,390² -1,776.

Wait, 1,776=42² *1. So, perhaps it's a perfect square.

Wait, 42²=1,764. Which is 12 less than 1,776. So, 1,776=42² +12. Doesn't seem like a perfect square.

Alternatively, perhaps D is not a perfect square, but let's see.

Wait, perhaps it's a perfect square. Let me compute 5,390 - a small number.

Let me try 5,380²= (5,400 -20)^2=5,400² -2*5,400*20 +20²=29,160,000 -216,000 +400=28,944,400. That's lower than D=29,050,324.

Wait, so 5,380²=28,944,400.

5,390²=29,052,100.

We need something in between.

Compute 5,385²: compute as (5,380 +5)^2=5,380² +2*5,380*5 +5²=28,944,400 +53,800 +25=28,998,225.

Still less than D.

5,385²=28,998,225.

5,395²= (5,390 +5)^2=5,390² +2*5,390*5 +5²=29,052,100 +53,900 +25=29,106,025.

Still higher than D=29,050,324.

So, between 5,385 and 5,390.

Let me compute 5,388²:

5,388²: Let me compute as (5,385 +3)^2=5,385² +2*5,385*3 +3²=28,998,225 +32,310 +9=29,030,544.

Still less than D=29,050,324.

Difference: 29,050,324 -29,030,544=19,780.

So, maybe 5,388 +x squared, where x is around 5.

Wait, 5,389²= (5,388 +1)^2=5,388² +2*5,388 +1=29,030,544 +10,776 +1=29,041,321.

Still less than D=29,050,324.

Difference:29,050,324 -29,041,321=9,003.

5,390²=29,052,100.

So, 29,052,100 -29,041,321=10,779.

Hmm, so the discriminant is not a perfect square. This complicates things, but perhaps we can work with it.

So, sqrt(D)=sqrt(29,050,324)= approximately 5,390 - but exact value is messy. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a computational error earlier. Let me check.

Wait, let me think again. The quadratic equation is 845x² -12482x +37500=0.

But since point A is at (10,0), which lies on line AD, and it's one of the intersection points of line AD with the circle. So, x=10 must be a root.

So, if x=10 is a solution, then we can factor (x -10) from the quadratic.

Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Let me check if x=10 is a root:

Plug x=10 into 845x² -12482x +37500:

845*(100) -12482*10 +37500=84,500 -124,820 +37,500= (84,500 +37,500) -124,820=122,000 -124,820= -2,820 ≠0.

Hmm, not zero. So, perhaps x=10 is not a root. But that contradicts, because line AD passes through A(10,0), so it must intersect the circle at A and P. So, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when substituting y into the circle equation.

Let me re-express the circle equation and substitution.

Circle equation: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Line AD: y= (-12√14/47)x + 120√14/47.

So, substitution:

x² + [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ]² -10x - (5√14/28)[ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 ) ] =0.

I think I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me recompute each term.

First, compute y² again:

y= (-12√14/47)x +120√14/47.

So, y= (√14/47)(-12x +120).

Thus, y²= (14/47²)(-12x +120)^2.

=14*(144x² - 2880x +14400)/47².

So that's correct.

Next, compute the term (5√14/28)y:

= (5√14/28)*(√14/47)(-12x +120).

=5*14/(28*47)*(-12x +120).

= (70)/(1316)*(-12x +120).

Wait, 28*47=1316. So, 70/1316=35/658=5/94.

So, (5√14/28)y=5/94*(-12x +120).

So, that term is correct.

So, substituting back into the circle equation:

x² + [14*(144x² -2880x +14400)/47²] -10x - [5*(-12x +120)/94] =0.

Wait, that's the same as before, so perhaps no mistake here.

So, seems that x=10 is not a root, but that's impossible because line AD passes through A(10,0), so x=10 must satisfy the equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the equation of line AD.

Let me recompute the slope of AD.

Point A: (10,0).

Point D: (-15/22,30√14/11).

Compute slope m_AD: (y_D - y_A)/(x_D -x_A)= (30√14/11 -0)/( (-15/22) -10 ).

Denominator: (-15/22 - 220/22 )= (-235/22).

So, slope= (30√14/11)/(-235/22)= (30√14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30√14 * (-22))/(11*235).

Simplify 30 and 235: GCD(30,235)=5.

30 ÷5=6, 235 ÷5=47.

22 and 11: 22=2*11.

So, (30√14 /11)*( -22/235 )= (6√14 /11)*( -22/47 )= (6√14 * (-22))/(11*47).

Simplify 22 and 11: 22/11=2.

So, becomes (6√14 * (-2))/47= -12√14/47.

So, slope is correct.

Thus, equation of AD is y= (-12√14/47)(x -10). So, at x=10, y=0, which is correct.

So, why when x=10, the equation doesn't satisfy? There must be a mistake in substitution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution process.

Let me try plugging x=10 into the circle equation and see if it holds.

Point A is (10,0).

Circle equation: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Substitute x=10, y=0:

10² +0² -10*10 - (5√14/28)*0=100 -100 -0=0. So, yes, point A satisfies the equation.

So, when I substituted y into the circle equation, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the substitution process, perhaps I missed some terms.

Wait, to find the intersection points, we should get two solutions: x=10 (point A) and x= x_P (point P). So, perhaps I'm missing something in the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should parameterize line AD and substitute into the circle equation.

Let me parameterize line AD. Let me let t be a parameter such that when t=0, we're at A(10,0), and when t=1, we're at D(-15/22,30√14/11).

So, parametric equations:

x =10 + t*( -15/22 -10 )=10 + t*(-235/22).

y =0 + t*(30√14/11 -0 )= t*(30√14/11).

So, x=10 - (235/22)t.

y= (30√14/11) t.

Now, substitute x and y into the circle equation:

x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y=0.

Substituting:

[10 - (235/22)t]^2 + [ (30√14/11)t ]^2 -10*[10 - (235/22)t] - (5√14/28)*(30√14/11)t =0.

Let me expand each term.

First term: [10 - (235/22)t]^2= 100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t²=100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484) t².

Second term: [ (30√14/11)t ]^2= (900*14)/(121) t²=12600/121 t².

Third term: -10*[10 - (235/22)t ]= -100 + (2350/22)t= -100 + (1175/11)t.

Fourth term: -(5√14/28)*(30√14/11)t= -(5*30*14)/(28*11) t= -(2100)/(308) t= -(2100 ÷ 28)/(308 ÷28 )= -75/11 t.

Now, combine all terms:

First term:100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t².

Second term:+12600/121 t².

Third term: -100 + (1175/11)t.

Fourth term: -75/11 t.

So, sum all terms:

Constant terms:100 -100=0.

t terms: (-4700/22 +1175/11 -75/11)t.

Convert all to 22 denominator:

-4700/22 + (1175*2)/22 - (75*2)/22= (-4700 +2350 -150)/22= (-4700 +2200)/22= (-2500)/22= -1250/11.

t² terms:55225/484 +12600/121.

Convert to common denominator 484:

55225/484 + (12600*4)/484=55225/484 +50400/484= (55225 +50400)/484=105625/484.

So, equation becomes:

(105625/484)t² - (1250/11)t =0.

Factor out t:

t*(105625/484 t -1250/11 )=0.

So, solutions are t=0, which corresponds to point A(10,0), and:

105625/484 t -1250/11=0 => t= (1250/11)/(105625/484).

Compute t:

t= (1250/11) * (484/105625)= (1250 *484)/(11*105625).

Simplify:

484 ÷11=44.

So, 1250*44 /105625.

Compute 1250 ÷105625: 105625 ÷1250=84.5. Wait, 1250*84=105,000, so 1250*84.5=105,625.

So, 1250/105625=1/84.5=2/169.

Wait, 84.5=169/2, so 1/84.5=2/169.

So, t= (1250 *44)/(11 *105625)= (1250/105625)*44/11.

= (2/169) * (44/11)= (2/169)*4=8/169.

So, t=8/169.

Thus, point P corresponds to t=8/169.

Now, compute x and y coordinates of P.

x=10 - (235/22)*t=10 - (235/22)*(8/169).

Compute (235*8)/(22*169)=1880/(3718).

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 940/1859.

Can't reduce further. So, x=10 -940/1859= (10*1859 -940)/1859= (18590 -940)/1859=17650/1859.

Similarly, y= (30√14/11)*t= (30√14/11)*(8/169)=240√14/(11*169)=240√14/1859.

So, point P is at (17650/1859, 240√14/1859).

Now, we need to find the length AP.

Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (17650/1859, 240√14/1859).

So, distance AP= sqrt( (x_P -10)^2 + (y_P -0)^2 ).

Compute x_P -10=17650/1859 -10=17650/1859 -18590/1859= (17650 -18590)/1859= (-940)/1859.

Similarly, y_P=240√14/1859.

So,

AP= sqrt( ( -940/1859 )^2 + (240√14/1859 )^2 ).

Factor out (1/1859)^2:

= (1/1859) * sqrt(940² + (240√14)^2 ).

Compute inside sqrt:

940²= (900+40)^2=900² +2*900*40 +40²=810000 +72000 +1600=883,600.

(240√14)^2=240²*14=57,600*14=806,400.

So, sum=883,600 +806,400=1,690,000.

sqrt(1,690,000)=1,300.

So, AP= (1/1859)*1300=1300/1859.

Now, simplify the fraction 1300/1859.

Check if 1300 and 1859 have any common factors.

1859 ÷13=143. So, 13*143=1859.

143 ÷11=13. So, 143=11*13.

Thus, 1859=13*11*13=11*13².

1300=13*100=13*2²*5².

So, common factor is 13.

Thus, 1300 ÷13=100.

1859 ÷13=143.

So, AP=100/143.

100 and 143: 143=11*13; 100=2²*5². No common factors. So, reduced fraction is 100/143.

Thus, AP=100/143, so m=100, n=143. m +n=243.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). We place point \(C\) at the origin \((0,0)\), point \(A\) at \((10,0)\), and find the coordinates of \(B\) using the distance formula. Solving the system of equations derived from the distances, we find \(B\) at \(\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right)\).

Next, we determine the equation of the circumcircle \(\omega\) of triangle \(ABC\). Using the general form of the circle equation and substituting the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), we find the center of the circle at \((5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56})\) and the radius.

We then find the equations of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). The tangent at \(C\) is found to be \(y = -4\sqrt{14}x\), and the tangent at \(B\) is derived using the slope of the radius and point-slope form. Solving these two tangent equations, we find the intersection point \(D\) at \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

The equation of line \(AD\) is determined using the slope between \(A\) and \(D\). We then find the intersection of line \(AD\) with the circumcircle \(\omega\) again at point \(P\). By parameterizing line \(AD\) and substituting into the circle's equation, we solve for the parameter \(t\) and find the coordinates of \(P\).

Finally, we compute the distance \(AP\) using the distance formula between points \(A\) and \(P\). Simplifying, we find \(AP = \frac{100}{143}\), leading to \(m + n = 100 + 143 = 243\).

**Answer:** \(\boxed{243}\)
