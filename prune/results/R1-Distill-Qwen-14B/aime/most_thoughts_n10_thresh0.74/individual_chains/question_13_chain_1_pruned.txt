Okay, so Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and times, and I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Let me break this down. First, I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, maybe I can set up some equations based on the information given.

In the first scenario, she walks at a speed of s km/h and takes 4 hours in total, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop. Wait, but t is in minutes, so I should convert that to hours to keep the units consistent. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours. So, the actual walking time is 4 hours minus t/60 hours.

So the equation for the first scenario would be:
Walking time = (9 km) / (s km/h) = 4 hours - (t/60 hours)
Which simplifies to:
9 / s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 km/h and takes 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So the total time is 2.4 hours, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop. Again, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So the walking time is 2.4 hours minus t/60 hours. The equation would be:
9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Now I have two equations:
1. 9 / s = 4 - (t/60)
2. 9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Hmm, I can solve these two equations to find s and t. Once I have s, I can calculate the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me write the equations again:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can rearrange both equations to express them in terms of t/60. Let's subtract the two equations to eliminate t.

From Equation 1: t/60 = 4 - (9/s)
From Equation 2: t/60 = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Since both equal t/60, I can set them equal to each other:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Now, let me solve for s.

Subtract 2.4 from both sides:
4 - 2.4 - (9/s) + (9/(s + 2)) = 0
Which simplifies to:
1.6 - (9/s) + (9/(s + 2)) = 0

Let me combine the terms with 9:

1.6 + 9 [ 1/(s + 2) - 1/s ] = 0

Compute 1/(s + 2) - 1/s:

= [s - (s + 2)] / [s(s + 2)]
= [s - s - 2] / [s(s + 2)]
= (-2) / [s(s + 2)]

So, plugging back into the equation:

1.6 + 9 * [ (-2)/(s(s + 2)) ] = 0

Which is:

1.6 - (18)/(s(s + 2)) = 0

Bring the second term to the other side:

1.6 = (18)/(s(s + 2))

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

1.6 * s(s + 2) = 18

Let me compute 1.6 as 8/5 to make it easier:

(8/5) * s(s + 2) = 18

Multiply both sides by 5:

8 * s(s + 2) = 90

Divide both sides by 8:

s(s + 2) = 90 / 8
s(s + 2) = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

This is a quadratic equation. Let me solve for s using the quadratic formula.

s = [-2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-11.25) )]/(2 * 1)
= [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2
= [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2
= [-2 ± 7]/2

So the two possible solutions are:

s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5
s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now that I have s, I can find t.

Using Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Plug s = 2.5:

9 / 2.5 = 4 - (t/60)

9 divided by 2.5 is 3.6.

3.6 = 4 - (t/60)

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3.6 - 4 = - (t/60)
-0.4 = - (t/60)

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4 = t/60

So t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

Wait, that's 24 minutes she spends at the coffee shop each time.

Now, the question asks: What is the time taken when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes in the coffee shop.

s is 2.5 km/h, so s + 1/2 is 3 km/h.

So her walking speed is 3 km/h. Let me compute the walking time.

Walking time = distance / speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

But wait, that's just the walking time. The total time includes the coffee shop time, which is t =24 minutes.

So total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 180 minutes. 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but the problem says to include t minutes, so 3 hours is 180 minutes plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

But wait, let me make sure. Wait, the way the problem was phrased earlier: when she walks at s, the total time is 4 hours including t. So the 4 hours includes walking plus coffee shop. So in this case, when she walks at 3 km/h, the walking time is 3
