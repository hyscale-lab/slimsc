Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what the functions f and g are. The function f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|, which means it's the absolute value of (absolute value of x minus 1/2). Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. These seem to be absolute value functions with some transformations, so their graphs are going to be V-shaped or maybe more complex.

I think it would help to graph f(x) and g(x) first. Let's start with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so the graph shifts down by 1/2. But since it's inside an absolute value, the parts where this expression would be negative get reflected above. So the graph of f(x) will have vertices at where |x| = 1/2, so x = ±1/2. So for f(x), when |x| >= 1/2, the function becomes |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape opening upwards. Between -1/2 and 1/2 on the x-axis, f(x) will be 1/2 - |x|, which is a V-shape opening downwards. So f(x) looks like a diamond shape with vertices at (1/2, 0), (-1/2, 0), and the point at the bottom is (0, 1/2).

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that. The inner |x| is a V-shape. Subtracting 1/4 gives us a shift down. Taking the absolute value again, so when |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, and when |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. So the graph of g(x) has vertices at (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0), with a peak at (0, 1/4).

So f(x) is a diamond with width 1 (from -1/2 to 1/2) and height 1/2. g(x) is a diamond with width 1/2 and height 1/4.

Now, let's think about how these functions are composed. The functions f and g are applied inside each other, and then scaled by 4. Let's take f(sin(2πx)) first.

Wait, no, the main functions are 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So each is 4 times g of f of either sin or cos. Hmm. Let's try to break down what 4g(f(z)) looks like, where z is either sin(2πx) or cos(3πy).

Let me denote z as some variable, like z = sin(2πx) or z = cos(3πy). Then f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|. Let's consider what f(z) does. Since z is between -1 and 1 because it's a sine or cosine function, |z| ranges from 0 to 1.

So f(z) = | |z| - 1/2 |. Let's think about the possible values.

When |z| is between 0 and 1/2, |z| - 1/2 is negative, so f(z) becomes 1/2 - |z|.

When |z| is between 1/2 and 1, f(z) becomes |z| - 1/2.

So f(z) will have a maximum value when |z|=1. Then f(z)=1 - 1/2=1/2.

Similarly, when |z|=1/2, f(z) is zero.

So f(z) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g(f(z)) is ||f(z) - 1/4|. Since f(z) is between 0 and 1/2, let's evaluate g(f(z)).

g(w) = ||w| - 1/4|, where w = f(z). So for w in [0, 1/2]:

If w < 1/4, then |w - 1/4| = 1/4 - w.

If w >= 1/4, then |w - 1/4| = w - 1/4.

So g(w) is a piecewise function:

g(w) = 1/4 - w for w < 1/4,

g(w) = w - 1/4 for w >= 1/4.

So g(f(z)) will be:

- For f(z) < 1/4: g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z).

- For f(z) >=1/4: g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4.

Since f(z) itself is between 0 and 1/2, the output of g(f(z)) will range from:

At f(z) =0: g=1/4.

At f(z)=1/4: g=0.

At f(z)=1/2: g=1/2 -1/4=1/4.

So the maximum of g(f(z)) is 1/4, occurring when f(z)=0 or f(z)=1/2.

Wait, no, when f(z)=1/2, g(f(z))=1/4. When f(z)=0, g(f(z))=1/4. When f(z)=1/4, g(f(z))=0.

So the graph of g(f(z)) is a V-shape that goes from 1/4 at f(z)=0 down to 0 at f(z)=1/4, then back up to 1/4 at f(z)=1/2.

So g(f(z)) is a function that has a minimum of 0 at f(z)=1/4 and maximum of 1/4 at the endpoints.

But what does f(z) look like?

As I said, f(z) is a diamond shape with vertices at |z|=1/2 (so z=±1/2). So for z in [-1/2, 1/2], f(z) is 1/2 - |z|, and for |z| >1/2, f(z)=|z| -1/2.

But z is either sin(2πx) or cos(3πy), both of which are between -1 and 1.

So, for z = sin(2πx): since sin varies between -1 and 1, |z| varies between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for z = cos(3πy): same thing.

So, to find g(f(z)):

When |z| is in [0,1/2], f(z) =1/2 - |z|.

When |z| is in [1/2, 1], f(z)= |z| -1/2.

So, when |z| is in [0,1/2], f(z) is in [0,1/2], and when |z| is in [1/2,1], f(z) is in [0,1/2].

So, for any z, f(z) is in [0,1/2], and then g(f(z)) is as discussed earlier.

Therefore, 4*g(f(z)) will scale this function so that the maximum is 4*(1/4)=1, and the minimum is 0.

So 4*g(f(z)) will have a range of [0, 1].

So, 4*g(f(z)) is a function that for each z, gives a value between 0 and 1.

So, the first equation is y = 4*g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second equation is x =4*g(f(cos(3πy))).

Hmm, so each equation is a function that maps x to y and y to x respectively, but they are both parameterized by trigonometric functions.

Wait, but the first is y as a function of x, and the second is x as a function of y. So the intersections are points (x,y) where y =4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4
