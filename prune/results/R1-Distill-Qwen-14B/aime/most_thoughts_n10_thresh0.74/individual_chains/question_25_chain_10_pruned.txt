Okay, so I need to solve this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given for everyone. But besides that, they might own a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, or a garden spade. 

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.

Additionally, it's mentioned that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things, which includes the candy hearts and the other three items.

Hmm, okay. So, let me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem that uses the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of their intersections, adding back in the sizes of intersections of triples, and so on.

But wait, since each resident must own the candy hearts, which is the fourth thing, maybe I should model this as four sets instead of three. Let me clarify the problem again.

Wait, no. The candy hearts are mentioned as something everyone owns. So, every resident owns at least the candy hearts. The other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are optional. So, the other three are separate, and the candy hearts are universal.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, that's guaranteed for everyone. So, the four things are: candy hearts (C), diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spade (S). But since every resident has C, they can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or all 4 of these. But in the problem, when they mention "exactly two of these things," are they including the candy hearts? Or are they referring only to the three items besides candy hearts?

Let me re-read the problem statement.

"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things."

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "these things"â€”which might refer to the three things: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. Because earlier, it says "who own a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, and a garden spade." So, the "these things" could be those three. But the problem is that the candy hearts are also a thing each owns. So, it's a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says, "the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the four things are C (
