Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability, so each color has a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me think about this. So, first, the octagon is regular, meaning all its sides and angles are equal. That also means that it has rotational symmetry. So, if we rotate it by certain angles, the octagon will look the same. In this case, since it's an octagon, the rotational symmetry is by multiples of 45 degrees, because 360/8 = 45.

Each vertex is colored red or blue with a 50% chance for each color. So, each vertex is an independent Bernoulli trial with p=0.5.

The problem is about the probability that there exists a rotation (i.e., a rotation by some multiple of 45 degrees) such that after applying that rotation, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. In other words, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Or, phrased differently, the blue vertices are a translated (rotated) version of the red vertices.

Wait, but since every vertex is either red or blue, the set of blue vertices is just the complement of the set of red vertices. So, the problem is equivalent to asking whether the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you have a rotation that maps reds to blues, then the blues must be a rotated version of the reds.

So, another way to think about this is: is the coloring of the octagon such that the blue vertices form a rotational image of the red vertices? So, the coloring must be symmetric in a way that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

But wait, since the octagon has rotational symmetry, any rotation of the red set will also be a valid set of vertices, each colored red. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, that would mean that the entire coloring is a kind of rotational shift of the original.

But let me think in terms of group theory. The octagon's rotational symmetry group is cyclic of order 8. So, for each possible rotation (identity, 45, 90, ..., 315 degrees), we can check whether applying that rotation maps red vertices to blue vertices.

But how do we compute the probability of this happening?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of orbits. Each vertex is part of an orbit under rotation, but since the octagon is regular, each vertex is in a single orbit of size 8. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each vertex is fixed under the identity rotation, but when we rotate, each vertex cycles through all positions.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for a given coloring, we can check for each possible rotation (including identity) whether the rotated coloring has all blue vertices where the original had red. So, for each rotation g in the rotation
