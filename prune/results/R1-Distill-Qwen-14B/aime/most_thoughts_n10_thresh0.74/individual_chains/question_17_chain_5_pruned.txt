Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes. The set B consists of all rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, let's say a, b, c. The surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac), and the volume is abc. So for set B, 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Now, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2. Therefore, r² would be (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, to minimize the sphere's radius, I need to minimize the space diagonal of the box, which is equivalent to minimizing a² + b² + c², since the radius is proportional to the square root of that sum.

So the problem reduces to minimizing a² + b² + c² given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but maybe I can also approach it using inequalities.

Let me write down the given constraints:

1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 => ab + bc + ac = 27
2. abc = 23

And the function to minimize is f(a,b,c) = a² + b² + c².

I remember that for three variables with fixed surface area and volume, the minimal space diagonal occurs when the box is as "cube-like" as possible. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, I can try to express a² + b² + c² in terms of ab + bc + ac and maybe other symmetric functions.

Wait, I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since I know ab + bc + ac is 27, I can write:

(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2*27 = a² + b² + c² + 54.

But I don't know a + b + c. Hmm. Maybe I can find a relation for a + b + c using the given constraints.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM ≥ GM inequality or other inequalities.

But first, let's think about the symmetric properties. Suppose we fix the volume and surface area, and want to minimize the space diagonal.

I might need to set up a system of equations. Let's denote:

Let me denote x = a, y = b, z = c.

Then:

1. x + y + z = S (unknown)
2. xy + yz + zx = 27
3. xyz = 23

And we need to find the minimum of x² + y² + z².

Wait, from equation 1, if I can relate S to other terms, but I don't have S. Alternatively, maybe I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of S and known quantities.

Because x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = S² - 2*27 = S² - 54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², it's equivalent to minimizing S², since 54 is a constant.

Wait, no, because x
