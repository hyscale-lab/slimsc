Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are satisfied. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. So, each row will form a 3-digit number when read left to right. Similarly, each column will form a 2-digit number when read top to bottom. 

The problem states that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers (from the rows) should be 999. Additionally, the sum of the three 2-digit numbers (from the columns) should be 99.

Let me denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the first row is the number "abc" which translates to 100a + 10b + c. The second row is "def" which is 100d + 10e + f.

The sum of these two numbers should be 999:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Similarly, the columns are:

First column: "ad" which is 10a + d.

Second column: "be" which is 10b + e.

Third column: "cf" which is 10c + f.

The sum of these should be 99:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

So now, I have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I need to find all possible digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9) that satisfy these equations.

Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these equations to find relations between the variables.

Let me write equation 1 as:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

And equation 2 as:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

I can think of the first equation as the sum of two 3-digit numbers, and the second as the sum of three 2-digit numbers.

I wonder if I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 or manipulate them in some way.

Wait, let's consider the first equation. Let me expand it:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

And the second equation:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

If I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, perhaps I can get some useful information.

Let me compute equation 1 minus equation 2:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99.

Simplify the left side:

100a - 10a + 10b - 10b + c - 10c + 100d - d + 10e - e + f - f = 900.

Simplify each term:

90a + 0 + (-9c) + 99d + 9e + 0 = 900.

So, 90a -9c +99d +9e = 900.

I can factor out a 9:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c +11d + e = 100.

So, equation 3 is:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Hmm, that's interesting. Now, equation 3 involves a, c, d, e. Let me see if I can find other relations.

Alternatively, maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

Looking back at equation 2:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Let me think about the maximum and minimum possible values.

Each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit from 0 to 9. So, 10a can be 0 to 90, d is 0-9, 10b is 0-90, e is 0-9, 10c is 0-90, f is 0-9.

So, the maximum possible sum in equation 2 is 90 +9 +90 +9 +90 +9 = 90+90+90 + (9+9+9) = 270 + 27 = 297. But we need it to be 99, which is much lower. So, the variables can't be too large.

Similarly, equation 1 is two 3-digit numbers adding to 999. So, each number is at most 999, but the sum is exactly 999. So, the maximum possible value for the first number is 999 - 0 = 999, but the second number would be 0, which is allowed if all digits in the second row are zero. But that might not be possible given the column constraints.

Wait, but in the example given, the second row is 9,9,1, which makes 991, and the first row is 0,0,8, which makes 8. So, 8 + 991 = 999. So, that's a valid case.

But let's think about how to approach this. Maybe it's better to work with equation 3 and equation 2.

Let me rewrite equation 3:

10a - c +11d + e = 100.

I can think of this as:

(10a +11d) + (-c +e) = 100.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express e in terms of other variables.

From equation 3:

e = 100 -10a + c -11d.

Since e is a digit (0-9), the right side must be between 0 and 9.

So, 0 ≤ 100 -10a + c -11d ≤ 9.

Let me write that as:

100 -10a + c -11d ≥ 0,

and

100 -10a + c -11d ≤ 9.

Let me rearrange both inequalities.

First inequality:

100 -10a + c -11d ≥ 0.

Which can be written as:

10a +11d ≤ 100 + c.

Since c is at most 9, 100 + c ≤ 109.

So,

10a + 11d ≤ 109.

Second inequality:

100 -10a + c -11d ≤ 9.

Rearranged as:

-10a -11d ≤ 9 - 100 -c.

Which is:

-10a -11d ≤ -91 -c.

Multiply both sides by -1 (and reverse inequality):

10a +11d ≥ 91 + c.

So, combining the two inequalities:

91 + c ≤10a +11d ≤109 + c.

But c is a digit (0-9), so 91 ≤10a +11d ≤109, since c can be at most 9, so 109 + c is 118. Wait, no, the upper bound is 109 + c, but 10a +11d is ≤109 + c, but since c is at most 9, 10a +11d is ≤118.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me consider that e must be a digit, so 0 ≤ e ≤9.

From equation 3: e = 100 -10a + c -11d.

So, 0 ≤ 100 -10a + c -11d ≤9.

Let me denote S = 100 -10a + c -11d.

So, 0 ≤ S ≤9.

Therefore,

100 -10a + c -11d ≥0,

and

100 -10a + c -11d ≤9.

Now, let me write these as:

10a +11d ≤ 100 + c,

and

10a +11d ≥ 91 + c.

So, for each c, 10a +11d must be between 91 + c and 100 + c.

But since a and d are digits (0-9), let's see what 10a +11d can be.

The minimum value of 10a +11d is 0 (a=0, d=0).

The maximum is 10*9 +11*9 = 90 +99=189. But given that 10a +11d is between 91 +c and 100 +c, and c is up to 9, the lower bound is at least 91, and the upper bound is at most 109.

So, 91 ≤10a +11d ≤109.

So, 10a +11d must be in that range.

Given that, I can try to find all possible
