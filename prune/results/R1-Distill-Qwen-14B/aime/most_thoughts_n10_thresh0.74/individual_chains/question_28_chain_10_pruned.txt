Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each face. That point is called the incenter, right? I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is equidistant from all four faces, similar to the incenter in a triangle.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

So, it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. That probably means it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Maybe it's called isohedral or something? Not sure, but the symmetry might help.

I think the key is to find the volume of the tetrahedron first because the distance from the incenter to each face (which is the inradius) relates to the volume and the surface area. The formula I remember is similar to the 2D case: volume = (1/3) * surface area * inradius. Wait, actually, in 3D, the formula is Volume = (1/3) * (sum of the areas of the faces) * inradius. So, if I can find the volume and the total surface area, I can solve for the inradius.

So, let me plan this out:

1. Calculate the volume of tetrahedron ABCD.
2. Calculate the areas of each of the four faces.
3. Sum up the areas to get the total surface area.
4. Use the formula Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius to solve for inradius.

But how do I find the volume? Since all the edges are given, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, the volume can be calculated using a determinant of a matrix.

The Cayley-Menger determinant formula is:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:

| 0    1      1      1      1    |
| 1    0    AB²   AC²   AD² |
| 1  AB²    0     BC²   BD² |
| 1  AC²  BC²     0     CD² |
| 1  AD²  BD²   CD²     0    |

So, let me assign the given lengths:

AB = √41 ⇒ AB² = 41
AC = √80 ⇒ AC² = 80
AD = √89 ⇒ AD² = 89
BC = √89 ⇒ BC² = 89
BD = √80 ⇒ BD² = 80
CD = √41 ⇒ CD² = 41

So, plugging these into the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me check:

- Row 1 corresponds to AB², AC², AD². So AB² = 41, AC² = 80, AD² = 89. So yes, Row 1 is [1, 0, 41, 80, 89].

- Row 2 is BC², BD², CD². Wait, no. Wait, no, the rows are:

Row 0: variable

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD²

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD²

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD²

Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0

Yes, that's correct. So, that's the matrix for the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Let me write out the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix.

Calculating a 5x5 determinant by hand is going to be tedious, but perhaps there's some symmetry I can exploit. Let's see.

Looking at the matrix, it's symmetric across the main diagonal. So, maybe I can find some patterns or simplify it.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant step by step. Let me try expanding along the first row.

The determinant formula is:

CM = 0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)

But the first element is 0, so the first term is 0. Then it's -1 times the determinant of the minor for the element (0,1), plus 1 times determinant of minor (0,2), minus 1 times determinant of minor (0,3), plus 1 times determinant of minor (0,4).

Wait, so the formula for the determinant when expanding along the first row (row 0) is:

det(CM) = 0*(something) - 1 * det(M11) + 1 * det(M12) - 1 * det(M13) + 1 * det(M14)

Where M1j is the minor matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column j.

So let's compute each minor:

First, M11 is the minor for element (0,1). Removing row 0 and column 1:

So, the minor matrix M11 is:

Row 1: 1, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 80, 41, 0

Wait, isn't that the same as the original matrix but without row 0 and column 1?

Yes.

Similarly, M12 is the minor for (0,2), so remove row 0 and column 2:

Row 1: 1, 0, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 41, 0

Wait, no, in the original matrix, column 2 is AB², AC², AD², etc. Wait, maybe I should write them down.

Wait, the original matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

So, M11 (removing column 1) would have:

Row 1: 1, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 80, 41, 0

Wait, that's a 4x4 matrix. Similarly, M12 is removing column 2, so:

Row 1: 1, 0, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 41, 0

Wait, perhaps
