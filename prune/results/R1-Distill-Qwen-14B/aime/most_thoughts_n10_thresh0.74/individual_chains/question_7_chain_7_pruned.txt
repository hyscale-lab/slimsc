Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to understand. So, each vertex is independently colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance. Then, we can rotate the octagon, and we want all the blue vertices after rotation to be in positions where the original color was red. That means, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, every blue vertex moves to a spot that was previously red.

Wait, so for this condition to hold, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices? Or maybe more specifically, the blue vertices must be a rotation of some subset of the original red vertices.

I think the key here is that the blue vertices must form a subset that is a rotation of the red vertices. Because if I rotate the octagon, each blue vertex moves to a new position, and I want all those new positions to have been red originally.

So, let's denote the octagon as having vertices labeled 0 through 7. Each vertex is either red or blue.

We can represent the coloring as a binary string of length 8, where each bit is 0 (red) or 1 (blue). Since each vertex is colored independently, there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings.

Now, we need to find the number of colorings where there exists a rotation (i.e., a cyclic shift) such that when we apply that rotation, all the blue vertices (1s) move to positions that were originally red (0s). 

Wait, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you rotate the octagon, each vertex moves to a new position, so the color at each vertex in the original coloring moves to another position. So, after rotation, the color that was at position i is now at position (i + k) mod 8, where k is the rotation amount.

We want that for all positions j, if the color at position j after rotation is blue, then the original color at position j was red. So, in terms of sets, the set of blue vertices after rotation (which is the original set of blue vertices shifted by k positions) must be a subset of the set of red vertices in the original coloring.

But wait, no. Because if we rotate by k, then the blue vertices in the original coloring are moved to other positions. So, the condition is that for each blue vertex in the original coloring, when we rotate it by k, it lands on a position that was originally red.

So, the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the set of positions that, when shifted by k, land on red positions. Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be a translate (by k) of the set of red vertices.

Wait, maybe another way: Letâ€™s say the original coloring has R red vertices and B blue vertices, with R + B = 8. If we can rotate the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a red position, then the set of blue vertices
