Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all angles equal. 

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting vertices in certain ways. Since a rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees, I wonder how that applies to a dodecagon.

Let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 vertices. If I pick four vertices to form a rectangle, they need to satisfy the condition that the sides are parallel and equal. But in a regular polygon, sides are only in specific directions. So, for a dodecagon, each vertex is spaced 30 degrees apart because 360 degrees divided by 12 is 30. 

Wait, but rectangles require right angles. So, the sides of the rectangle must lie along lines that are spaced 90 degrees apart. But in a dodecagon, each side is 30 degrees apart. So, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned along every 3rd vertex? Because 3 times 30 is 90. Hmm, that makes sense. So, if I connect every third vertex, that line would be at 90 degrees from another such line.

Let me think. So, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel lines, each pair separated by a certain number of steps around the dodecagon. Each pair should be aligned in the same direction, separated by a certain number of vertices.

In a regular dodecagon, the possible distances between vertices (the number of edges skipped) can vary. For example, adjacent vertices are 1 step apart, then 2, 3, up to 5 steps because beyond that, it's the same as going the other way around.

Wait, right. In a 12-gon, the maximum minimal step between two vertices is 5 because 12/2 = 6, so beyond 5 steps, it's shorter to go the other way. So, the possible distances are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 steps apart. But wait, 6 steps would be directly opposite each other, forming a diameter.

So, for rectangles, we need two different step sizes, say 'a' and 'b', such that the sides are 'a' steps apart and the other sides are 'b' steps apart. But these step sizes must correspond to lines that are perpendicular to each other.

But how do I find which step sizes correspond to perpendicular lines? Since the dodecagon is regular, the angle between two vertices can be calculated using the step size. Each step corresponds to a central angle of 30 degrees. So, if two chords are perpendicular, the difference in their central angles should be 90 degrees. 

Wait, that might not be exactly right. Because the angle between two chords isn't just the difference in their central angles; it's the angle between the two lines from the center to the vertices. So, if I have two chords with step sizes 'a' and 'b', the angle between them can be calculated as the difference in their angles from the center.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. In a regular polygon, two chords are perpendicular if the number of steps between their vertices corresponds to a quarter of the polygon. Since 12 is divisible by 4, a quarter would be 3 steps. So, step sizes that are 3 apart might be perpendicular.

Wait, maybe. For example, if I connect every 3rd vertex, that's a step size of 3, which should create a line at 90 degrees from another such line. Because 3 steps correspond to 90 degrees, so two lines each with step size 3 would be perpendicular.

Alternatively, maybe any two step sizes that are 3 apart? Let me think. If I have a step size of 'k', the angle between the chord and the center is 15k degrees because each step is 30 degrees, and the chord is at half that angle. Wait, no, the central angle is 30 degrees per step, but the angle of the chord with the horizontal would be half that? Or is it different.

Wait, maybe I should recall that in a regular polygon with n sides, the angle between two adjacent vertices from the center is 2Ï€/n radians. For a dodecagon, that's 30 degrees. The angle between a chord and the center is half of the central angle? Or maybe not. Let's see.

For a regular polygon, each vertex is at an angle of 30k degrees from a reference axis, where k is the step from a starting vertex. So, vertex
