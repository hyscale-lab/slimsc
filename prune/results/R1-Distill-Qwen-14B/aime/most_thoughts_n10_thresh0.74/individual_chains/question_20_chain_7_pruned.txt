Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of them in the 25 cells of the grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. Now, the key conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, any extra chip placed would violate one of the previous two conditions. So the placement should be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without breaking the first two rules.

Hmm, okay. So each row must be entirely one color, and each column must be entirely one color. But wait, that can't be the case because then every cell would have to be the same color, right? Because if all rows are the same color, then all cells would be that color. But the problem allows for some cells to be filled, not necessarily all. Wait, no, because the first two conditions are for the chips that are placed. So if a row has any chips, all of them must be the same color. Similarly for columns.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So if a row has at least one chip, all of them must be the same color. Similarly for columns. So each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Same with each column.

But then, let's think about this. If a row is non-empty, it must be all white or all black. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. But if a row is non-empty, then all the cells in that row must be same color, which would impose that the columns intersecting that row must be the same color as that row. Otherwise, if a column has different colors, that would violate the column condition.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a grid where each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is either all white, all black, or empty. But the problem is that the color of the row and column must agree where they intersect.

Wait, that's a good point. For example, if a row is white, then every column that intersects that
