Okay, so I need to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, and all sides and angles are equal. So, it's a 12-sided polygon with each internal angle equal to 150 degrees. I remember that the sum of internal angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2)*180 degrees, so for 12 sides, it's (10)*180 = 1800, so each internal angle is 150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about finding rectangles. Each rectangle must have its sides lying on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, essentially, the sides of the rectangle are either edges of the dodecagon or lines connecting non-adjacent vertices (diagonals). 

I think the key here is to figure out how to choose four points (vertices) in the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. But wait, not every four points will form a rectangle. They need to satisfy certain conditions.

In a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the four vertices are symmetric in some way. For example, in a regular polygon, if you pick two pairs of points that are diametrically opposite, they might form a rectangle. But wait, in a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, the diameter might not necessarily be a straight line between two vertices because 12 is even, but maybe not a multiple of 4. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so the number of vertices is 12. So, in a regular dodecagon, each vertex can be connected to others via various diagonals. The diagonals can be of different lengths based on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal connecting two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that skips two vertices, and so on.

But for a rectangle to form, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel. Also, the diagonals of the rectangle must bisect each other. In a regular polygon, this implies that the center of the polygon is the intersection point of the rectangle's diagonals.

So, maybe I can model this by considering the vertices as points on a circle, since a regular polygon is inscribed in a circle. Each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference. So, the rectangle's diagonals would be diameters of this circle, but wait, only if the rectangle is a square or has its diagonals passing through the center.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle are either edges or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle cannot be arbitrary lines; they must coincide with the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

So, maybe I need to find all sets of four points (vertices) such that the four sides connecting
