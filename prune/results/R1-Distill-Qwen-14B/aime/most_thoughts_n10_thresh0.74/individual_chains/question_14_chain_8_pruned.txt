Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay, four-digit number. So N is between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number with this specific property. Let me try to understand the property.

The property is: whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is a four-digit number, say ABCD, then changing the first digit to 1 gives 1BCD, and that should be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing the second digit to 1 gives A1CD, which should also be divisible by 7. Same with B, C, D. Each time, changing a different digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7.

So, for N = ABCD, the four numbers 1BCD, A1CD, AB1D, ABC1 must all be divisible by 7. That's the key property here.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q + R where Q = N // 1000 and R = N % 1000.

Let me start by thinking about how to approach this. Since N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, perhaps we can construct N by starting from 9999 and moving downwards, checking each number to see if it satisfies the condition. But that might be time-consuming because we have to check each number. Instead, maybe there's a smarter way to figure out the constraints on N.

Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits (a is from 1 to 9, others from 0 to 9).

Now, according to the problem, changing any digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 +10c + d must be divisible by 7.

3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b +10 + d must be divisible by 7.

4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c +1 = 1000a + 100b +10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm. So each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. Let me try to represent each of these conditions modulo 7.

First, let's compute 1000 mod 7. Let's see, 1001 is 7×143, so 1001 ≡ 0 mod 7. Therefore, 1000 ≡ -1 mod 7. Similarly, 100 ≡ 100 mod 7. Let's compute 100 divided by 7: 7×14=98, so 100 -98=2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod7. 10 mod7 is 3. 1 mod7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite each condition using these modular equivalences.

1. 1000 + 100b +10c +d ≡ (-1) + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

2. 1000a + 100 +10c +d ≡ (-1)*a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

3. 1000a +100b +10 + d ≡ (-1)*a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7.

4. 1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡ (-1)*a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So now we have four congruence equations:

1. -1 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7. --> 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

2. -a + 2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7. --> -a +3c +d ≡ -2 mod7. Which is same as -a +3c +d ≡5 mod7, since -2 mod7 is 5.

3. -a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7. --> -a +2b +d ≡-3 mod7. Which is same as -a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 (since -3 +7=4).

4. -a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7. --> -a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7. Which is same as -a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So now, four equations:

Equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation 2: -a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Equation 3: -a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Equation 4: -a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So we have four equations with variables a, b, c, d. All variables are digits: a from 1-9, b,c,d from 0-9.

Our goal is to find the largest N=1000a+100b+10c+d, so we want a as large as possible, then b, c, d as large as possible.

So perhaps we can find a way to express these equations in terms of each other.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

From Equation 4: -a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. Let's write this as:

Equation4: -a +2b +3c =6 +7k, where k is integer.

Similarly, Equation1: 2b +3c +d=1 +7m.

Equation2: -a +3c +d=5 +7n.

Equation3: -a +2b +d=4 +7p.

Hmm. Let's try to subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Let me attempt to subtract Equation3 from Equation2:

Equation2: -a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Equation3: -a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Subtracting Equation3 from Equation2:

(-a +3c +d) - (-a +2b +d) = (5 -4) mod7.

So, [0a + (3c -2b) +0d] ≡1 mod7.

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Let me note this as Equation5: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, perhaps we can find other relations.

From Equation4: -a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

From Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

So, Equation4 can be rewritten as: (-a) + (2b +3c) ≡6 mod7.

From Equation1: (2b +3c) + d ≡1 mod7.

Let me denote S = 2b +3c.

Then Equation1: S + d ≡1 mod7.

Equation4: -a + S ≡6 mod7.

So from Equation4: S ≡ a +6 mod7.

Substitute into Equation1: (a +6) + d ≡1 mod7.

So, a + d +6 ≡1 mod7 --> a + d ≡-5 mod7, which is a + d ≡2 mod7.

So Equation6: a + d ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, let's see Equation2: -a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

We can write this as: (-a + d) +3c ≡5 mod7.

But from Equation6: a + d ≡2 mod7 --> d ≡2 -a mod7.

Substitute into Equation2: (-a + (2 -a)) +3c ≡5 mod7.

Simplify: (-a +2 -a) +3c ≡5 mod7 --> (-2a +2) +3c ≡5 mod7.

So, -2a +3c ≡3 mod7.

Equation7: -2a +3c ≡3 mod7.

Earlier, from Equation5: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

So we have:

Equation5: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Equation7: -2a +3c ≡3 mod7.

Let me write them together:

3c -2b ≡1 (Equation5)

-2a +3c ≡3 (Equation7)

Hmm, so perhaps subtract Equation5 from Equation7:

(-2a +3c) - (3c -2b) ≡3 -1 mod7.

Simplify:

-2a +3c -3c +2b ≡2 mod7.

So, -2a +2b ≡2 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, this is allowed):

- a + b ≡1 mod7.

So, Equation8: -a + b ≡1 mod7 --> b ≡a +1 mod7.

Since a and b are digits (a:1-9, b:0-9), let's think about possible values for b in terms of a.

So, b = a +1 +7k, where k is integer.

But since b is a single digit (0-9), and a is 1-9, let's see possible k.

Case 1: k=0 --> b = a +1. Then, since a is at most 9, b can be at most 10, but since b is a digit (0-9), a can be at most 8 (so b=9 when a=8). If a=9, then b=10, which is invalid. So for a=9, k must be 1.

Case 2: k=1 --> b = a +1 +7. So b =a +8. Since a is at least 1, then b would be at least 9. But since b is at most 9, this gives a +8 ≤9 --> a ≤1. So a can only be 1 here, resulting in b=9.

So possible scenarios:

Either:

- b = a +1, with a ≤8, so b is a valid digit.

Or:

- a=1, b=9.

So, let's proceed with these cases.

First, let's consider b = a +1.

Then, we can substitute back into Equation5: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Since b =a +1, substitute:

3c -2(a +1) ≡1 mod7 --> 3c -2a -2 ≡1 mod7 --> 3c -2a ≡3 mod7.

Equation9: 3c ≡2a +3 mod7.

Similarly, from Equation7: -2a +3c ≡3 mod7.

Which is the same as Equation9.

So, Equation9: 3c ≡2a +3 mod7.

We can write this as:

3c ≡ (2a +3) mod7.

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod7. The inverse of 3 mod7 is 5 because 3×5=15≡1 mod7.

So, c ≡5*(2a +3) mod7.

Compute 5*(2a +3) =10a +15.

10a mod7: 10≡3 mod7, so 10a ≡3a mod7.

15 mod7: 15=2×7 +1, so 15≡1 mod7.

So, 10a +15 ≡3a +1 mod7.

Thus, c ≡(3a +1) mod7.

So, c = (3a +1) +7m, where m is integer. Since c is a digit (0-9), possible values are determined by a.

So, c = (3a +1) mod7, but it's more precise to say c = (3a +1) +7m, with c between 0 and9.

So, for each a, c can be calculated as (3a +1) mod7, but actually, it's the residue, so c ≡3a +1 mod7. But c must be a digit, so c can be that residue or that plus 7, but not exceeding 9.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express c as c= (3a +1) mod7, but since c must be a digit, c can be equal to (3a +1) mod7, or (3a +1) mod7 +7, provided it's less than or equal to 9.

Alternatively, c can be either (3a +1) mod7 or (3a +1 +7) mod7, but let's see.

Wait, no: c must be between 0 and9, inclusive. So if (3a +1) mod7 is say, r, then c can be r or r+7, as long as r+7 ≤9.

So, for each a, compute r = (3a +1) mod7. Then, c can be r or r+7, provided r+7 ≤9.

Similarly, let's think about the possible values of a. Since we're looking for the greatest four-digit N, we'll want a as large as possible. So starting from a=9, and moving down.

Let me try a=9.

Case 1: a=9.

Then, from Equation8: b =a +1=10, which is invalid, since b must be a digit (0-9).

So, for a=9, b can't be 10. So we have to consider the other case where a=1, but that's for when k=1 in Equation8.

Wait, earlier, Equation8: b ≡a +1 mod7, so if a=9, b ≡10 mod7 ≡3 mod7. So possible b=3 or 10, but 10 is invalid. So b=3.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine Equation8.

Equation8: -a +b ≡1 mod7 --> b ≡a +1 mod7.

So, for a=9, b ≡10 mod7 ≡3 mod7. So b can be 3 or 3+7=10, but 10 is invalid. So b=3.

So, for a=9, b=3.

Now, from Equation9: 3c ≡2a +3 mod7.

a=9, so 2a=18≡4 mod7. So 2a +3=4+3=7≡0 mod7.

Thus, 3c ≡0 mod7. So c must be ≡0 mod7, since 3 and7 are coprime. So c≡0 mod7.

Possible c=0 or7.

So, c=0 or c=7.

Now, from Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

We have b=3, a=9.

So, 2*3 +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

6 +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

So, 3c +d ≡1 -6 mod7 --> 3c +d ≡-5 mod7 --> 3c +d ≡2 mod7.

Now, c can be 0 or7.

Let's try c=7 first.

c=7:

3*7 +d ≡21 +d mod7. 21 mod7=0, so 0 +d ≡2 mod7 --> d≡2 mod7.

So d can be 2,9.

We want the largest possible N, so we'd choose d=9 first.

So, let's try c=7, d=9.

Check if this works with the other equations.

Wait, let's make sure all four conditions are satisfied.

So, N=9 3 7 9.

Check each condition:

1. Changing a to1: 1379. Check if 1379 divisible by7.

Compute 1379 ÷7: 7×197=1379? Let's see: 7×197=1379. Yes, so 1379 is divisible by7.

2. Changing b to1: 9179. Check divisibility by7.

Compute 9179 ÷7: 7×1311=9177, so 9179-9177=2. So 9179=7×1311 +2. Not divisible by7. So this condition fails.

Hmm, so this can't be right. So, our assumption that c=7 and d=9 with a=9, b=3 may not satisfy all conditions.

Wait, but how? Because our equations were supposed to hold.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the setup.

Wait, when a=9, b=3, c=7, d=9.

Let me verify all four conditions:

1. 1BCD =1379. 1379 ÷7=197, so yes, divisible by7.

2. A1CD=9179. 9179 ÷7=1311.285... So not divisible by7. So fails condition2.

Hmm, so something's wrong. Maybe our approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the equations. Let me double-check.

Wait, when we have N=abcd, changing the second digit to 1 gives A1CD, which is 1000a + 100*1 +10c +d. So in the case where a=9, b=3, c=7, d=9, that becomes 9179.

But 9179 is not divisible by7.

Wait, so perhaps our earlier approach misses some constraints because when we set up the equations modulo7, we might have multiple possibilities for the actual numbers, but only some of them satisfy the original condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the way I derived the equations is incorrect.

Wait, let me re-examine the equations.

When I wrote the four conditions, I considered each case:

1. Change a to1: 1000+100b+10c+d ≡0 mod7.

Yes, that's correct.

2. Change b to1:1000a +100 +10c +d ≡0 mod7.

Yes.

3. Change c to1:1000a +100b +10 +d ≡0 mod7.

Yes.

4. Change d to1:1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Yes.

So, equations are correct.

But perhaps when solving, I didn't take into account that the actual numbers could have multiple digits, so perhaps I need to consider more than just the mod7 conditions.

Wait, no, because if a number is congruent to 0 mod7, it's divisible by7. So the equations are correct.

So, perhaps the issue is that when we set up the equations, we assumed that the numbers would satisfy the congruence, but in reality, the numbers might have to be exactly 0 mod7, not just congruent, but that's the same as congruent.

Hmm, then why is 9179 not divisible by7 when our equations suggested it should be?

Wait, maybe because when we set up the equations, we considered the mod7 conditions, but perhaps the way we solved for c and d only gives congruences, not exact values. So when we set
