Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. O is the circumcenter, so it's the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and I is the incenter, the intersection of the angle bisectors.

It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from incenter I to circumcenter O.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be expressed using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Oh yeah, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)).

Let me compute OI. Given R is 13 and r is 6, so OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 2*6)) = sqrt(13*(13-12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So, OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the triangle formed by points A, I, and O is a right triangle at I. So, triangle AIO is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle AIO, IA is perpendicular to OI, which are the legs, and AO is the hypotenuse. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, AO² = AI² + OI².

I know AO is the distance from A to the circumcenter O. But in any triangle, the distance from a vertex to the circumcenter can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.

Wait, AO is just the circumradius, right? Because the circumradius is the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex. So, AO = R = 13.

So, plugging into the Pythagorean theorem: 13² = AI² + (sqrt(13))². So, 169 = AI² + 13. Then, AI² = 169 - 13 = 156. So, AI = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).

Okay, so AI is 2*sqrt(39). Now, I need to find AB·AC. Hmm, how can I relate AI to the sides of the triangle?

I remember that AI is the length from the incenter to vertex A, and there's a formula for AI in terms of the triangle's inradius, semiperimeter, and angles.

The formula for AI is r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Alternatively, AI can also be expressed using the sides of the triangle.

Wait, let me check. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by AI = r / sin(A/2). Yes, that's the formula.

So, I have AI = r / sin(A/2). So, 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2). So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39). Let me rationalize that: 3*sqrt(39) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Hmm, so sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. So, cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, I can express cos A in terms of cos(A/2). Using the double-angle formula: cos A = 2 cos²(A/2) - 1. So, cos A = 2*(130/169) - 1 = 260/169 - 1 = (260 - 169)/169 = 91/169. So, cos A = 91/169.

Alternatively, 91 and 169 can both be divided by 13: 91 ÷13=7, 169 ÷13=13. So, cos A = 7/13.

Now, another formula I remember is that in any triangle, the product AB·AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Specifically, using the Law of Cosines, but I might need to think differently.

Wait, another approach: the area of the triangle can be expressed in two ways. The area is r*s, where r is the inradius and s is the semiperimeter. Also, the area is (1/2)*ab*sin C, but I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Wait, but AB and AC are sides adjacent to angle A. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. Then, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

But I need AB·AC = b*c. Hmm, how can I relate this to other quantities.

I also know that in a triangle, the area is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], but that might not be directly helpful.

Wait, maybe using the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r*s = 6*s.

Also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, (1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s.

So, (b*c) = (12*s) / sin A.

Hmm, but I don't know sin A yet. I know cos A, which is 7/13. So, sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.

So, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

So, plugging back into (b*c) = (12*s) / (2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = (12*s *13) / (2*sqrt(30)) ) = (78*s)/sqrt(30).

Hmm, so I need to find s.

Alternatively, maybe I can find s using other relations. Let's see.

I also know that in a triangle, the circumradius R is given by R = (a)/(2*sin A) = (b)/(2*sin B) = (c)/(2*sin C). So, perhaps I can find some sides in terms of angles.

Wait, but I might not have enough information for that yet.

Wait, another thought: I know that AI = r / sin(A/2). So, AI = 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2), which I used earlier.

Alternatively, AI can be expressed in terms of the sides: AI = (r)/sin(A/2) = (6)/sin(A/2).

But I also know that in terms of the semiperimeter, AI = (2*sqrt(b c s (s - a)))/ (b + c). Wait, I'm not sure about that formula. Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for the length of the angle bisector. AI is the length of the angle bisector from A to the inradius. Wait, but I think the formula for the angle bisector is different. Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for b and c in terms of s and a.

Let me denote the sides as follows: BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then, semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

We have several equations:

1. The area is r*s = 6*s.

2. The area is also (1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s.

3. From the Law of Cosines: a² = b² + c² - 2*b*c*cos A. Since cos A = 7/13, so a² = b² + c² - 2*b*c*(7/13).

4. The circumradius R is 13, so using the formula R = (a)/(2*sin A). So, 13 = a/(2*(2*sqrt(30)/13)).

Let me compute a from this.

So, R = a/(2*sin A).

So, 13 = a / (2*(2*sqrt(30)/13)).

Wait, let me compute 2*sin A: 2*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = (4 sqrt(30))/13.

So, 13 = a / ( (4 sqrt(30))/13 )

Multiply both sides by (4 sqrt(30))/13:

a = 13 * (4 sqrt(30))/13 = 4 sqrt(30).

So, a = 4 sqrt(30).

So, side BC is 4 sqrt(30).

Now, we have a = 4 sqrt(30), and from the Law of Cosines equation:

a² = b² + c² - 2*b*c*(7/13).

Compute a²: (4 sqrt(30))² = 16*30 = 480.

So, 480 = b² + c² - (14/13)*b*c.

Hmm, okay.

We also have the area expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s.

We know sin A is 2 sqrt(30)/13, so:

(1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 6*s.

Simplify: (b*c * sqrt(30))/13 = 6*s.

So, b*c = (6*s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

Hmm, so b*c = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

But I need another equation involving s.

We also know that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So, s = 2 sqrt(30) + (b + c)/2.

But maybe I can express s in terms of b and c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression for b + c.

Let me see. Let me denote S = b + c. Then, s = (4 sqrt(30) + S)/2.

So, s = 2 sqrt(30) + S/2.

But I'm not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, another idea: Maybe use Heron's formula for the area. The area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

But I already expressed the area as 6*s. So, 6*s = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

Square both sides: (6*s)^2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c).

Simplify: 36 s² = s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c).

Divide both sides by s: 36 s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c).

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, let me think about the relation between s and the other variables.

From the area, (1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s.

We have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so:

(1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 6*s.

Simplify: (b*c * sqrt(30))/13 = 6*s.

So, b*c = (6*13 s)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

But I also have from the Law of Cosines:

480 = b² + c² - (14/13) b c.

Hmm, now if I can express b² + c² in terms of (b + c)^2 and bc.

We know that (b + c)^2 = b² + 2bc + c². So, b² + c² = (b + c)^2 - 2 bc.

So, substituting into the equation:

480 = (b + c)^2 - 2 bc - (14/13) bc.

So, 480 = (b + c)^2 - (2 + 14/13) bc.

Compute 2 +14/13: 2 is 26/13, so 26/13 +14/13=40/13.

So, 480 = (b + c)^2 - (40/13) bc.

But from earlier, bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

And s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So, s = 2 sqrt(30) + (b + c)/2.

So, s = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

Let me denote t = b + c. Then, s = (4 sqrt(30) + t)/2.

So, s = 2 sqrt(30) + t/2.

Then, bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30) = 78/(sqrt(30)) * (2 sqrt(30) + t/2).

Simplify that:

bc = 78/(sqrt(30)) * [ (4 sqrt(30) + t)/2 ].

Wait, 2 sqrt(30) is equal to (4 sqrt(30))/2, so 2 sqrt(30) + t/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + t)/2.

So, bc = [78/(sqrt(30))] * [ (4 sqrt(30) + t)/2 ].

Let me compute this:

78/(sqrt(30)) * (4 sqrt(30) + t)/2 = [78/(sqrt(30)) * 4 sqrt(30) + 78/(sqrt(30)) * t ] / 2.

Simplify each term:

78/(sqrt(30)) *4 sqrt(30) = 78*4 = 312.

78/(sqrt(30)) * t = (78 t)/sqrt(30).

So, bc = (312 + (78 t)/sqrt(30))/2.

Simplify numerator: 312 is 78*4, and 78 t / sqrt(30) is as is.

So, bc = (312 + (78 t)/sqrt(30))/2 = 156 + (39 t)/sqrt(30).

So, bc = 156 + (39 t)/sqrt(30).

But t is b + c, so I can write bc = 156 + (39 (b + c))/sqrt(30).

Hmm, but I also have another equation from the Law of Cosines:

480 = t² - (40/13) bc.

So, substituting bc from above:

480 = t² - (40/13)(156 + (39 t)/sqrt(30)).

Let me compute (40/13)(156 + (39 t)/sqrt(30)).

First, 40/13 *156: 156 ÷13=12, 12*40=480.

Then, 40/13 * (39 t)/sqrt(30) = (40*39 t)/(13 sqrt(30)) = (40*3 t)/sqrt(30) = (120 t)/sqrt(30).

So, the equation becomes:

480 = t² - [480 + (120 t)/sqrt(30)].

So, 480 = t² - 480 - (120 t)/sqrt(30).

Bring all terms to one side:

t² - (120 t)/sqrt(30) - 480 - 480 = 0.

Simplify:

t² - (120 t)/sqrt(30) - 960 = 0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in t. Let me write it as:

t² - (120/sqrt(30)) t - 960 = 0.

Simplify the coefficient:

120/sqrt(30) can be rationalized:

120/sqrt(30) = (120 sqrt(30))/30 = 4 sqrt(30).

So, the equation becomes:

t² - 4 sqrt(30) t -960 = 0.

Now, let's solve for t using quadratic formula.

t = [4 sqrt(30) ± sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))² + 4*960 )]/2.

Compute discriminant D:

(4 sqrt(30))² = 16*30=480.

4*960=3840.

So, D = 480 + 3840 = 4320.

So, sqrt(D) = sqrt(4320). Let's simplify sqrt(4320).

4320 = 16 * 270 = 16 *9 *30 = 16*9*30.

So sqrt(4320) = 4*3*sqrt(30)=12 sqrt(30).

So, sqrt(D)=12 sqrt(30).

Thus, t = [4 sqrt(30) ±12 sqrt(30)]/2.

So, two possibilities:

1. t = (4 sqrt(30) +12 sqrt(30))/2 = (16 sqrt(30))/2=8 sqrt(30).

2. t = (4 sqrt(30) -12 sqrt(30))/2 = (-8 sqrt(30))/2 = -4 sqrt(30).

But since t = b + c is a length, it can't be negative. So, t =8 sqrt(30).

So, b + c =8 sqrt(30).

Now, from earlier, we had:

s = (4 sqrt(30) +8 sqrt(30))/2 = (12 sqrt(30))/2=6 sqrt(30).

So, semiperimeter s=6 sqrt(30).

Now, going back to bc.

We had bc = 156 + (39 t)/sqrt(30).

t=8 sqrt(30), so (39*8 sqrt(30))/sqrt(30)=39*8=312.

So, bc=156 +312=468.

Wait, so bc=468.

But bc is AB·AC if AB=c and AC=b. So, AB·AC=468.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, bc=468, which is AB·AC since AB=c and AC=b.

So, the answer is 468.

Wait, let me verify all steps again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

We found a=4 sqrt(30) from R=13 and sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.

Then, from Law of Cosines, 480 = b² + c² - (14/13) bc.

We let t=b + c and expressed bc in terms of s, then expressed s in terms of t, and ended up with a quadratic equation in t, which gave t=8 sqrt(30).

Then, s=6 sqrt(30).

Then, bc=78 s / sqrt(30)=78 *6 sqrt(30)/sqrt(30)=78*6=468.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, AB·AC=468.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{468}


Given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance \( OI \)**:
   Using Euler's formula, \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} = \sqrt{13(13 - 12)} = \sqrt{13} \).

2. **Right triangle \( \triangle AIO \)**:
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   AO^2 = AI^2 + OI^2
   \]
   \( AO = R = 13 \), so:
   \[
   13^2 = AI^2 + (\sqrt{13})^2 \implies 169 = AI^2 + 13 \implies AI^2 = 156 \implies AI = 2\sqrt{39}
   \]

3. **Using \( AI \) and trigonometric identities**:
   \( AI = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \implies 2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \).
   \[
   \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}
   \]
   \[
   \cos A = 2\cos^2(A/2) - 1 = \frac{7}{13}
   \]
   \[
   \sin A = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{7}{13}\right)^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}
   \]

4. **Using the circumradius \( R \)**:
   \[
   R = \frac{a}{2\sin A} \implies 13 = \frac{a}{2 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}} \implies a = 4\sqrt{30}
   \]

5. **Semiperimeter \( s \)**:
   Using the area formula \( \text{Area} = r \cdot s \) and \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = 6s \implies \frac{bc \cdot 2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 6s \implies bc = \frac{78s}{\sqrt{30}}
   \]

6. **Law of Cosines**:
   \[
   a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A \implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \frac{14}{13}bc
   \]

7. **Solving for \( bc \)**:
   Let \( t = b + c \). Then:
   \[
   s = \frac{4\sqrt{30} + t}{2}
   \]
   \[
   bc = 156 + \frac{39t}{\sqrt{30}}
   \]
   Solving the quadratic equation for \( t \):
   \[
   t = 8\sqrt{30}
   \]
   \[
   s = 6\sqrt{30}
   \]
   \[
   bc = \frac{78s}{\sqrt{30}} = 468
   \]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is \( \boxed{468} \).
