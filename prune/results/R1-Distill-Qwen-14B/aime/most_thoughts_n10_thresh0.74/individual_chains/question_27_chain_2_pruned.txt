Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So the torus is created by spinning this circle around that axis.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. The problem says that when the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I think I should start by recalling some properties of tori and how they can be tangent to spheres. The torus is a surface of revolution, so its geometry is pretty symmetric. When T is inside S, it's touching the sphere from the inside, and when it's outside, it's touching from the outside.

I remember that the torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

The sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the torus will be equal to the sphere's radius. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the minimum distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the torus will be equal to the sphere's radius.

Wait, no. Maybe the other way around. When the torus is inside, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center would be the sphere's radius. When it's outside, the closest point on the torus would be the sphere's radius. Let me think about that more carefully.

So, when T is inside S, the torus is entirely within the sphere, and they touch along a circle. That circle must lie where the torus's surface is just barely touching the sphere's inner surface. Similarly, when T is outside S, the torus encloses the sphere, and they touch along another circle. So, for the internal tangent case, the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to the torus would be equal to the sphere's radius of 11. For the external tangent case, the minimum distance from the center to the torus would be equal to 11.

I think that's right. So, we need to find the points on the torus that are at a distance of 11 from the sphere's center in both cases, the maximum and the minimum.

Wait, actually, maybe not the maximum and minimum, but specific points where the torus is tangent to the sphere. Hmm. Let me try to formalize this.

Let's set up a coordinate system. Let me assume that the axis of rotation of the torus is the z-axis. So, the center of the generating circle is at a distance R = 6 from the origin along the z-axis. But wait, actually, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, the center of the torus would probably coincide with the center of the sphere, right? Because otherwise, the torus might not be symmetrically tangent. Wait, maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, no, I think in both cases, the center of the torus is at the same point as the center of the sphere. Because the torus is just resting on the inside or outside, so it's centered at the same point as the sphere. Otherwise, the tangency would be more complicated.

So, the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is
