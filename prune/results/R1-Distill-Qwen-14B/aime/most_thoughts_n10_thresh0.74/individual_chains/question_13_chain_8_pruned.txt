Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to understand it step by step.

So, every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers. She stops at a coffee shop after, and that stop takes her t minutes. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the total time each takes, including the coffee shop time. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes.

Hmm. Let me break it down.

First, when she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the total time she takes is 4 hours. But this 4 hours includes t minutes at the coffee shop. So, the actual walking time is less than 4 hours. Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, right? Because 24 minutes is 0.4 hours. So again, this 2.4 hours includes t minutes in the coffee shop, meaning her walking time is less.

Wait, maybe I should convert everything into hours or everything into minutes to avoid confusion. Let's see. Let me decide on using hours since the walking speeds are given in km per hour.

So, first scenario:
Speed = s km/h
Total time = 4 hours (which includes walking time + coffee time)
Distance = 9 km.

So, the time she spends walking is (distance)/(speed) = 9/s hours. The total time is 4 hours, which includes the walking time and the coffee time. So, the walking time plus the coffee time equals 4 hours. So, coffee time is t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So, the equation would be:

9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, the second scenario:
Speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. So, the walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours, and the coffee time is still t/60 hours. So, the equation is:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now, I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4

2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t. Let me write that out.

(9/s + t/60) - (9/(s + 2) + t/60) = 4 - 2.4

Simplify the left side:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) + (t/60 - t/60) = 1.6

The t terms cancel out, so:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

I can factor out the 9:

9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] ) = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, plugging that back into the equation:

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Simplify:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2):

1.6 s² + 3.2 s

So, equation becomes:

18 = 1.6 s² + 3.2 s

Let me rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation:

1.6 s² + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimals:

16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, 1.6 *10 is 16, 3.2*10 is 32, 18*10 is 180. But since I moved 18 to the right side, it's actually 18*10=180, but with a negative sign because I subtracted 18 earlier. So, 16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0.

Hmm, can I simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 4?

16/4=4, 32/4=8, 180/4=45.

So, 4s² + 8s - 45 = 0.

Now, this is a quadratic equation: 4s² +8s -45 =0.

Let me solve for s using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax² + bx + c =0, so a=4, b=8, c=-45.

The quadratic formula is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Compute discriminant D = b² -4ac = (8)^2 - 4 *4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

Square root of 784 is 28.

So, s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2 *4 ) = [ (-8 ±28) ] /8

So, two solutions:

1) [ -8 +28 ] /8 = 20/8 = 2.5

2) [ -8 -28 ] /8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, that seems a bit slow for a walking speed. I mean, 2.5 km/h is about 1.55 miles per hour, which is a leisurely stroll. But maybe Aya walks slowly, so let's go with that.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Let's plug s back into one of the original equations.

Take equation 1: 9/s + t/60 =4.

So, 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So, 3.6 + t/60 =4.

t/60 = 4 -3.6 =0.4

So, t=0.4 *60=24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is, what is the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 =3 km/h.

So, speed =3 km/h

Distance =9 km.

Time walking is 9/3=3 hours.

Plus coffee time t=24 minutes.

So total time is 3 hours +24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes.

But the question says to find the number of minutes, including t.

3 hours is 180 minutes, so 180 +24=204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check.

First, s=2.5 km/h. 9/2.5=3.6 hours, which is 3 hours 36 minutes. Adding 24 minutes coffee would make 4 hours, which matches the first scenario.

Second scenario: speed =4.5 km/h. 9/4.5=2 hours. Adding 24 minutes gives 2 hours 24 minutes, which is correct.

So, when she walks at 3 km
