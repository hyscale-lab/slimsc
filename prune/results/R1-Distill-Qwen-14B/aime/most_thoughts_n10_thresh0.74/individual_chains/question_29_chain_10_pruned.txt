Okay, so I'm looking at this geometry problem, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the setup first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting because if four points lie on a circle, they are concyclic or lie on the same circumference, which might mean something about cyclic quadrilaterals.

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. I need to find CE.

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch of the rectangles. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF and GH are the lengths, and FG and EH are the widths.

Wait, so ABCD has AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle with length 107 and width 16. Similarly, EFGH has EF = 184 and FG = 17, so it's a rectangle with length 184 and width 17.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, I imagine that the rectangles are arranged in such a way that side DC of rectangle ABCD and side FG of rectangle EFGH are aligned along a straight line, with E and F lying on that line as well.

Wait, but D is a corner of ABCD and E is a corner of EFGH. Hmm. So, perhaps the rectangles are placed adjacent to each other along the line that contains D, E, C, F.

Let me think about the order of the points. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, maybe they are arranged in that order. So D comes first, then E, then C, then F on the same line. That would mean that segment DE is part of DC, which is the side of the rectangle ABCD. Similarly, segment CF would be part of FG, the side of EFGH.

Wait, but then if D, E, C, F are collinear in that order, DE
