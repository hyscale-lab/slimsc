Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. Tangents at points B and C to the circle ω meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So first, maybe I should draw the diagram or visualize it. Let me try to recall some properties related to tangents and circles. The tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, the tangent at B would be perpendicular to the radius OB, and similarly for the tangent at C.

Wait, but I don't know where the center O is. Maybe I can compute it using the given side lengths. Alternatively, perhaps I can use some other properties without finding O explicitly.

Given that D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, I remember that D is called the ex-pole or maybe the symmedian point? Or perhaps it's the ex-pole related to the A-excircle? Not sure, but maybe D is the exsymmedian point or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's the ex-pole of BC.

Alternatively, I remember that D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC with respect to BC. Because tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC. That's right, since D is the intersection of the two tangents, so DB = DC.

So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Now, I recall that point D is the ex-pole of BC, and thus lies on the A-symmedian. Wait, not sure, but perhaps AD is the symmedian. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can apply power of a point. The power of point D with respect to circle ω is DB² = DC² = (distance from D to ω)², since DB and DC are tangents.

Also, since AD passes through ω again at P, by power of a point, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DP * DA. So, DB² = DP * DA.

But wait, that's a useful relation. So, DB² = DP * DA. So, if I can find DB, then I can find DP in terms of DA, or vice versa. But since we need AP, perhaps we can express AP in terms of DA and DP.

Wait, AP is equal to DA - DP or DP - DA? Let me think. Point D is outside the circle, line AD passes through the circle, so starting from D, the line goes through A and then P. Wait, no, actually, A is on the circle because ABC is inscribed in ω. So, AD starts from D, goes through A, then P is another intersection point with the circle
