Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that plays into this product yet.

The product given is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, each term in the product is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern.

Let me first compute 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor it. Let me set x = ω^k, then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x². Let's see:

x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, is this factorable? Let's check the discriminant: b² - 4ac = (−2)^2 − 4(1)(2) = 4 − 8 = −4. So no real roots, but maybe factors over complex numbers? Or perhaps it's irreducible over integers. Maybe it's not factorable in a simple way. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this quadratic to something else.

Wait, another thought: 2 - 2x + x² can be rewritten as x² - 2x + 2. Maybe I can relate this to (x - a)(x - b) where a and b are roots. But since the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex. So the roots would be [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, in terms of ω^k, each term in the product is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So then, the entire product becomes:

∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Which can be written as [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

So, I can compute each product separately and then multiply them together.

Now, I recall that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, but in this case, we're evaluating at x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i. So, the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) is equal to Φ₁₃(a), right?

Wait, let me make sure. The cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are the primitive n-th roots of unity. For prime n, like 13, Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So, indeed, when you plug in a specific value a, the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) is equal to Φ₁₃(a). Wait, no, actually, since Φ₁₃(x) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x - ω^k), because k=0 gives x - 1, which is a separate factor. Wait, so actually, Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x - ω^k). Therefore, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = (x¹³ - 1).

So, for our case, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a¹³ - 1. Because (a - 1)(a
