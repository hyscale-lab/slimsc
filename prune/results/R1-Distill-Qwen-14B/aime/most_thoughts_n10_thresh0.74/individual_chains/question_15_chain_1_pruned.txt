Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's an 8x8 grid, so from (0,0) to (8,8). Each path is a sequence of moves either right or up. Since the grid is 8x8, moving from one corner to the other requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. So the total number of steps is 16, which makes sense because each path is length 16.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. I need to figure out how to model this. Changing direction means switching from moving right to up or from up to right. So, for example, a path that moves right for a few steps, then up for some, then right again, and so on, each switch counts as a change in direction.

Wait, so each time the path switches from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, if I have a path that alternates right and up every step, that would change direction 15 times, which is the maximum. But in this problem, it's only allowed to change direction four times. That means the path is made up of segments where it goes straight in one direction for a certain number of steps, then changes direction once, and so on.

So, the path can be thought of as a series of horizontal and vertical segments. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or upwards. The number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. For example, if a path has 5 segments, it changes direction 4 times.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So if a path changes direction exactly four times, it must consist of five segments. Each segment is either horizontal (right) or vertical (up). So, the path will have five segments, alternating between right and up.

Now, the key is to figure out how many such paths there are with exactly five segments, which would correspond to four direction changes.

Let me model this. The path has five segments. Let's say the first segment is to the right, then up, then right, then up, then right, etc., but it could also start with up first. Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, starting with up would mean the first segment is vertical, and then alternately horizontal, etc.

But actually, since the grid is square, the starting direction doesn't matter in terms of symmetry, so perhaps we can calculate the number of paths starting with right and then double it, but maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the number of horizontal and vertical segments. Since each path has five segments, and each segment alternates between horizontal and vertical.

Wait, but it's not necessarily starting with horizontal. It could start with either. So, maybe there are two cases: paths that start with a horizontal move and those that start with a vertical move. But wait, in the grid, the starting point is (0,0), so the first move
