Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and break it down.

We have points O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). These are in the first quadrant. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis.

We need to find a point C on AB, different from A and B, such that C doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. Then, we need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, find p + q.

Hmm. So, first, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. Since A is at (1/2, 0) and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB will be a line segment connecting those two points.

The family F consists of all possible unit-length segments PQ where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, and both are in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p and q positive, and the distance between P and Q is 1. Since PQ is a unit segment, the distance formula gives sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1.

Wait, but if all these segments are of unit length, then each PQ is a hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs p and q. So, all these PQs are in the first quadrant, connecting the x and y axes, with length 1.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB that's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one such segment in F, but C is on AB and not on any other PQ in F.

Our goal is to find OC².

First, I should probably parametrize the line AB. Let me find the equation of AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Alternatively, I can write it as sqrt(3)x + y = sqrt(3)/2.

But perhaps it's better to express AB in parametric form. Let me do that.

Let me let parameter t go from 0 to 1, where t=0 is point A and t=1 is point B. Wait, actually, if I go from A to B, the parametric equations would be x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2) t. Because when t=0, x=1/2, y=0, which is point A. When t=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is point B.

Alternatively, we can write it as (x, y) = (1/2, 0) + t*(-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). That might be more straightforward.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - (t)/2, 0 + t*sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So, C = ( (1 - t)/2 , (t sqrt(3))/2 ). Let me denote the coordinates of C as (h, k), so h = (1 - t)/2 and k = (t sqrt(3))/2.

Alternatively, we can express t in terms of h: since h = (1 - t)/2, then t = 1 - 2h. Then, k = ( (1 - 2h) * sqrt(3) ) / 2. So, k = sqrt(3)(1 - 2h)/2. That's the equation of line AB.

Let me check: when h = 1/2, k = 0, which is point A. When h = 0, k = sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. That's correct.

Now, the family F consists of all segments PQ where P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p² + q² = 1. So, for each such PQ, the equation of the segment is the line connecting (p,0) and (0,q). Since both are on the axes, the equation can be written as x/p + y/q = 1.

So any point on PQ must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

We need to find a point C on AB such that C is not on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, the point C is unique in that it's only on AB and not on any other PQ in F.

So, we need to find C on AB such that it's not on any PQ in F except AB. That is, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, the condition is that for any other PQ in F, the point C doesn't lie on PQ.

In other words, for all other PQ in F, the equation x/p + y/q = 1 is not satisfied by (h, k), except when PQ is AB itself.

Wait, but maybe the condition is stronger: that C is not on any PQ from F except when PQ is AB. So, except for PQ being AB, C is not on any other PQ in F.

So, to ensure this, the point C must not lie on any other line x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² =1, except for the line AB.

So, let's find the equation of AB again. The line AB connects A(1/2,0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the equation is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3
