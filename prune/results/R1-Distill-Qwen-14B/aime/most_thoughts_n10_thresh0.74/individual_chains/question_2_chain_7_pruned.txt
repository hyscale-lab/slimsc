Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I want to solve it step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These form a triangle OAB. The family F consists of line segments PQ of unit length, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, all lying in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1, in the first quadrant.

There's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is part of family F, and C is only on AB and no other PQ in F. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then find p + q.

First, let me visualize the situation. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is a line segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all unit segments from the x-axis to y-axis, so each PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and sqrt(p² + q²) = 1.

Wait, actually, the length of PQ is 1, so sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, for all such segments, p² + q² = 1. But since P is on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, each such segment is a part of the line connecting (p,0) and (0,q), with p and q positive, and p² + q² = 1.

So, family F is all such line segments for all p and q satisfying this condition.

Now, AB is one such segment. Let me verify that. Point A is (1/2, 0), so p = 1/2, and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), so q = sqrt(3)/2. Let's check if p² + q² equals 1.

(1/2)² + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a segment of F.

Now, we need to find point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment of F. So, C is on AB but not on any other PQ in F. Because each PQ is a line segment from a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis with length 1, their equations are of the form x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² = 1.

So, for every (p, q) with p² + q² = 1, we have a line x/p + y/q = 1. All these lines form the family F. So, each PQ is such a line.

Since AB is part of F, for the point C to lie only on AB and no other segment in F, C must be such that it's not on any other line x/p + y/q = 1 except for the one corresponding to AB.

Alternatively, C is the intersection point of AB with the envelope of the family F. The envelope is the set of points that are tangent to some member of the family. So, if we can find the envelope of the family F, then the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again.

Another approach: For any point C on AB, except A and B, if C is not on any other PQ, then the system of equations representing AB and any other PQ in F should not have C as a common point.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is such that the line AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if AB is tangent to the envelope at point C, then C would lie on AB and on exactly one PQ in F (which is AB itself), so it doesn't lie on any other PQ.

So, perhaps I need to find the envelope of the family F and then find where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Let me recall how to find the envelope of a family of curves. For a family of curves given by F(x, y, t
