Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite typically involves moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, that means we have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves.

Now, without any restrictions on direction changes, the number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But this problem is more specificâ€”it wants paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction... So, each time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, how does that relate to the number of runs in the sequence of moves? A "run" is a consecutive sequence of the same move. For example, RRUURRUU has three runs of R and three runs of U, making a total of six runs.

If a path changes direction exactly four times, that means the number of runs is five. Because each change corresponds to a new run. For instance, if you start with R, then change to U, that's two runs. Each additional direction change adds another run. So, four changes mean five runs in total.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of sequences of R and U moves with exactly five runs, consisting of 8 R's and 8 U's.

I think there's a formula or concept related to runs in binary sequences. Maybe something from combinatorics about the number of compositions or something like that.

Let me recall. For a binary sequence with a certain number of runs, the number of such sequences can be calculated using combinations. Let's say we have m runs of R and n runs of U. Wait, but the total runs would be m + n. But in our case, since the path starts at the lower left and ends at the upper right, the first move must be either R or U, and the last move must correspond accordingly. Wait, no, actually, the path starts with a lower left corner, so the first move can be either R or U, but I think in the case of an 8x8 grid, you have to go exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, so maybe the number of runs can be split between R and U.

Wait, perhaps for a sequence with k runs, the number of R runs and U runs must differ by at most one. Because you start with either R or U, then alternate. So, if you have an even number of runs, you have equal numbers of R and U runs. If odd, then one more of the starting direction.

In our case, the total number of runs is five. Five is odd, so the number of R runs and U runs must differ by one. So, either there are three R runs and two U runs, or three U runs and two R runs.

Wait, let's think. Starting with R, then U, R, U, R: that's three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, starting with U, then R, U, R, U: that's three U runs and two R runs.

So, in total, for five runs, we have two cases: 3 R runs and 2 U runs, or 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

So, the total number of such sequences would be the sum of the two cases.

Let me think about how to calculate each case.

For each case, say 3 R runs and 2 U runs, the number of ways is:

C(8,2) * C(8,3) * 1. Wait, no, that's not exactly right.

Wait, no, actually, when you have multiple runs, each run of R must consist of at least one step, same for U. So, if we have 3 R runs, we're partitioning the
