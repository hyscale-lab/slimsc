Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's try breaking it down.

First, let's write down what's given. We have three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, which is the first equation:

a + b + c = 300.

The second equation is a bit more complex. It's a sum of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. So, it's:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I notice that each term in this second equation is symmetric in two variables. So, for example, a²b and a²c are similar because they both have a squared and then multiplied by another variable. Similarly, b²a and b²c, and so on. 

Wait, maybe we can factor this expression somehow. Let me see. If I look at a²b + a²c, that's a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So, combining these, the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler. Now, since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can substitute for (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in the equation.

Let me calculate each of those:

b + c = (a + b + c) - a = 300 - a.

Similarly, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Expanding each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now we have an equation involving a², b², c², a³, b³, c³. I wonder if there's a way to relate this to the sum a + b + c.

I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, then 300² = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, if I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of ab + bc + ca, that might help.

Let me write that down:

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, substituting this into the equation we had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) = 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) = 300*90,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca).

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) = 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca).

So, plugging this back into the equation:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let's rearrange this:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 = 600(ab + bc + ca) + (a³ + b³ + c³).

So, 21,000,000 = 600(ab + bc + ca) + (a³ + b³ + c³).

Hmm, okay. So now, the equation is:

600(ab + bc + ca) + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate a³ + b³ + c³ to a + b + c as well. I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of (a + b + c)^3 and other symmetric sums.

The identity is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, given that a + b + c = 300, the equation becomes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Calculating 300³, that's 27,000,000.

So, substituting this into our equation:

21,000,000 = 600(ab + bc + ca) + [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc].

Let me expand that:

21,000,000 = 600(ab + bc + ca) + 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Combining like terms:

21,000,000 = (600 - 900)(ab + bc + ca) + 27,000,000 + 3abc.

Which simplifies to:

21,000,000 = (-300)(ab + bc + ca) + 27,000,000 + 3abc.

Now, subtract 27,000,000 from both sides:

21,000,000 - 27,000,000 = -300(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Which gives:

-6,000,000 = -300(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Let me rearrange this:

-6,000,000 + 300(ab + bc + ca) = 3abc.

Divide both sides by 3:

-2,000,000 + 100(ab + bc + ca) = abc.

Hmm, so:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Let me factor this equation a bit. Maybe factor out terms.

Let me write it as:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps factor by grouping. Let's see:

Take ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b).

Wait, but that might not work. Let me think.

Alternatively, notice that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so maybe I can express this equation as:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca + 1000000 = -2,000,000 + 1,000,000.

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can add 1,000,000 to both sides to complete some product.

Wait, let's see. Another approach: Let me add 100^3 to both sides to see if that helps.

Wait, 100^3 is 1,000,000, but let me see:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca + 100^3 = -2,000,000 + 100^3.

Which would be:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca + 1,000,000 = -2,000,000 + 1,000,000.

So, right side is -1,000,000.

But the left side, can I factor it? Let me try:

abc -100ab -100bc -100ca + 1,000,000.

Hmm, that seems like it might factor into (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100), but let's check.

Expanding (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100):

= abc -100ab -100ac + 10,000a -100bc + 10,000b + 10,000c - 1,000,000.

Wait, that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, our left side is abc -100ab -100bc -100ca + 1,000,000.

Comparing to the expansion of (a-100)(b-100)(c-100):

abc -100ab -100ac -100bc + 100*100*a + 100*100*b + 100*100*c - 100³.

Which is:

abc -100ab -100ac -100bc + 10,000a + 10,000b + 10,000c - 1,000,000.

Hmm, so the left side of our equation is abc -100ab -100bc -100ca + 1,000,000, which is the same as (a-100)(b-100)(c-100) minus 10,000(a + b + c) + 1,000,000.

Wait, no, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider substituting variables.

Let me set x = a - 100, y = b - 100, z = c - 100. Then, a = x + 100, b = y + 100, c = z + 100.

Substituting into the equation:

abc - 100ab -100bc -100ca + 1,000,000 = (x + 100)(y + 100)(z + 100) - 100(x + 100)(y + 100) - 100(y + 100)(z + 100) - 100(z + 100)(x + 100) + 1,000,000.

This looks complicated, but maybe expanding it will help.

First, expand (x + 100)(y + 100)(z + 100):

= xyz + 100xy + 100xz + 100yz + 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z + 1,000,000.

Then, compute each term:

-100(x + 100)(y + 100) = -100[xy + 100x + 100y + 10,000] = -100xy -10,000x -10,000y -1,000,000.

Similarly, -100(y + 100)(z + 100) = -100yz -10,000y -10,000z -1,000,000.

And -100(z + 100)(x + 100) = -100zx -10,000z -10,000x -1,000,000.

So, putting it all together:

(x + 100)(y + 100)(z + 100) -100(x + 100)(y + 100) -100(y + 100)(z + 100) -100(z + 100)(x + 100) + 1,000,000

= [xyz + 100xy + 100xz + 100yz + 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z + 1,000,000]

+ [ -100xy -10,000x -10,000y -1,000,000 ]

+ [ -100yz -10,000y -10,000z -1,000,000 ]

+ [ -100zx -10,000z -10,000x -1,000,000 ]

+ 1,000,000.

Now, let's combine like terms.

First, the xyz term: xyz.

Now, the xy terms: 100xy -100xy = 0.

xz terms: 100xz -100zx = 0 (since xz and zx are the same).

yz terms: 100yz -100yz = 0.

Now, the x terms: 10,000x -10,000x -10,000x = -10,000x.

Similarly, y terms: 10,000y -10,000y -10,000y = -10,000y.

z terms: 10,000z -10,000z -10,000z = -10,000z.

Now, the constants: 1,000,000 -1,000,000 -1,000,000 -1,000,000 +1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

So, putting it all together:

xyz -10,000x -10,000y -10,000z -1,000,000.

So, the left side of our equation, which was abc -100ab -100bc -100ca + 1,000,000, becomes:

xyz -10,000x -10,000y -10,000z -1,000,000.

And this equals the right side, which was -1,000,000.

So:

xyz -10,000x -10,000y -10,000z -1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

Adding 1,000,000 to both sides:

xyz -10,000x -10,000y -10,000z = 0.

Hmm, so:

xyz = 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z.

Factor out 10,000:

xyz = 10,000(x + y + z).

But wait, x = a - 100, y = b - 100, z = c - 100. So, x + y + z = (a + b + c) - 300 = 300 - 300 = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So x + y + z = 0.

So, xyz = 10,000*(0) = 0.

So, xyz = 0.

So, either x = 0, y=0, or z=0.

Which means that either a = 100, b=100, or c=100.

So, this simplifies things. So our condition is that at least one of a, b, c must be 100.

So, the triples (a, b, c) must have at least one of the variables equal to 100.

But wait, let's recall that a + b + c = 300.

So, if one of them is 100, say a=100, then b + c = 200.

Similarly, if b=100, then a + c = 200, and if c=100, then a + b = 200.

But we have to consider all possible triples where at least one of a, b, c is 100.

But we also need to ensure that we don't double-count. For example, the case when two variables are 100 would be counted in two different cases, so we need to use inclusion-exclusion.

So, let's compute the number of triples where a=100, plus the number where b=100, plus the number where c=100, then subtract the cases where two variables are 100 (since they've been counted twice), and then add back the case where all three are 100 (since it's been subtracted too many times).

So, first, let's compute the number of triples with a=100.

If a=100, then b + c = 200. Since b and c are nonnegative integers, the number of solutions is 201 (from b=0, c=200 up to b=200, c=0).

Similarly, the number of triples with b=100 is also 201, and the same for c=100. So, 3 * 201 = 603.

Now, subtract the cases where two variables are 100. Let's compute the number of triples where a=100 and b=100.

If a=100 and b=100, then c = 300 - 100 -100 = 100. So, c must also be 100. So, there's only 1 such triple: (100,100,100).

Similarly, there's 1 triple where a=100 and c=100, and another where b=100 and c=100. Wait, no, wait. No, because if a=100 and c=100, then b=100 as well. So, in each case, the only triple where two variables are 100 is when all three are 100. Wait, no, actually, if two variables are 100, then the third is 100 as well. Because a + b + c = 300, so if a=100 and b=100, then c=100. So, the only triple where two variables are 100 is when all three are 100.

Wait, but more precisely, the number of triples where a=100 and b=100 is 1 (c=100). Similarly for a=100 and c=100, it's 1, and for b=100 and c=100, it's 1. So, 3 cases where two variables are 100, but each of those cases is actually the same triple (100,100,100). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in each case, two variables are set to 100, but the third is determined. So, each of these is a distinct case.

Wait, no. If a=100 and b=100, then c=100. So, that's one triple. Similarly, if a=100 and c=100, then b=100, which is the same triple. Same with b=100 and c=100. So, actually, all these cases point to the same triple. So, there is only one triple where two variables are 100, which is (100,100,100).

Wait, but that's not correct. Because in each case, when you set two variables to 100, the third is forced to be 100 as well, so each of the three possible pairs (a and b, a and c, b and c) leads to the same triple. So, the number of such triples is 3, but all of them are the same triple, which is (100,100,100). Wait, no, that can't be. Because (100,100,100) is one triple, but when you set a=100 and b=100, you get c=100, which is the same as the triple where all three are 100. So, actually, the only triple where two variables are 100 is the triple where all three are 100. So, in other words, the number of triples where two variables are 100 is 1.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because if I fix a=100 and b=100, then c=100, which is one unique triple. Similarly, if I fix a=100 and c=100, it's the same triple. So, the three possible ways of fixing two variables as 100 all lead to the same triple. Therefore, the total number of triples where two variables are 100 is 1, not 3.

But that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me think again. If a=100 and b=100, then c must be 100. Similarly, if a=100 and c=100, then b must be 100, etc. So, in all cases, the only triple that satisfies two variables being 100 is (100,100,100). So, the count is 1.

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total triples with at least one variable equal to 100 = (number with a=100) + (number with b=100) + (number with c=100) - (number with a=100 and b=100) - (number with a=100 and c=100) - (number with b=100 and c=100) + (number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100).

But from above, number with a=100 is 201. Similarly, each is 201. So, 3*201 = 603.

Number with a=100 and b=100 is 1, same for a=100 and c=100, and b=100 and c=100. So, 3*1 = 3.

Number with all three 100 is 1.

So, inclusion-exclusion formula:

Total = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601.

Wait, that's 603 - 3 +1 = 601.

Wait, let me check:

Total = (A + B + C) - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC.

Where A is a=100, B is b=100, C is c=100.

So, A = B = C = 201.

AB = AC = BC =1.

ABC =1.

So, Total = 201 + 201 + 201 -1 -1 -1 +1 = 603 -3 +1 = 601.

So, the total number of triples is 601.

Wait, but let me make sure that these triples actually satisfy the second equation. Because it's possible that some of these triples, even though they have a=100, b=100, etc., might not satisfy the second equation.

Wait, but the way we derived this was by using the given equations and arriving at the conclusion that one of the variables must be 100. So, if we have a triple where at least one of a, b, c is 100, it should satisfy the second equation.

Wait, let's test this with a sample triple. Let's take a=100, b=100, c=100.

Then, compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each term is 100²*100 = 100³ = 1,000,000.

There are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Which matches the second equation.

Another test case: a=100, b=0, c=200.

Compute a²b = 100²*0 = 0.

a²c = 100²*200 = 10,000*200 = 2,000,000.

b²a = 0²*100 = 0.

b²c = 0.

c²a = 200²*100 = 40,000*100 = 4,000,000.

c²b = 0.

So, total = 0 + 2,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 4,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. That works.

Another case: a=100, b=50, c=150.

Compute each term:

a²b =100²*50=10,000*50=500,000.

a²c=100²*150=10,000*150=1,500,000.

b²a=50²*100=2,500*100=250,000.

b²c=50²*150=2,500*150=375,000.

c²a=150²*100=22,500*100=2,250,000.

c²b=150²*50=22,500*50=1,125,000.

Adding them up: 500,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,000,000.

Then, 250,000 + 375,000 = 625,000.

2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000.

Total: 2,000,000 + 625,000 = 2,625,000; 2,625,000 + 3,375,000 = 6,000,000. Perfect.

Another test case: a=200, b=100, c=0.

Compute the terms:

a²b =200²*100=40,000*100=4,000,000.

a²c=200²*0=0.

b²a=100²*200=10,000*200=2,000,000.

b²c=100²*0=0.

c²a=0²*200=0.

c²b=0²*100=0.

Total:4,000,000 + 0 + 2,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6,000,000. Correct.

So, all these cases work. So, it seems that the condition that at least one of a, b, c is 100 is both necessary and sufficient for the second equation to hold, given that a + b + c =300.

Therefore, the number of triples is 601.

But wait, I should make sure that there are no other solutions beyond the ones where at least one variable is 100. Because sometimes in such problems, you might have other solutions that you didn't account for.

Wait, let's suppose that none of a, b, c is 100. Then, from the equation xyz =0, we have that at least one of x, y, z is zero, which implies that at least one of a, b, c is 100. So, actually, there are no solutions where none of a, b, c is 100. Therefore, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100. Hence, our count of 601 is the correct total.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me just confirm that by considering the equation xyz = 0. Since that equation came from the given conditions, any solution must satisfy xyz=0, which implies at least one of x, y, z is zero, so at least one variable is 100. Therefore, all solutions are accounted for in the 601 cases.

So, the final answer should be 601.

But wait, wait another thought. When we derived xyz =0, we had to make sure that the substitution was correct.

We had:

xyz -10,000x -10,000y -10,000z =0.

But then, since x + y + z =0, we substituted that into the equation, leading us to xyz=0.

Wait, let me just go through that substitution again.

We had:

xyz = 10,000(x + y + z).

But since x + y + z =0, so xyz=0.

So, yes, that's correct.

So, given that substitution, xyz=0, so at least one of x, y, z is zero, which implies that a=100, b=100, or c=100.

Therefore, all solutions must have at least one of a, b, c equal to 100, and the count is 601.

Therefore, the number of triples is 601.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{601}


Given the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000
\]
as:
\[
a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000
\]
Using the identity \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\) into the equation:
\[
a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
\]
Using the identity \((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\), we find:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
Substituting this back, we get:
\[
27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
\]
Simplifying further, we find:
\[
21,000,000 = 600(ab + bc + ca) + (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)
\]
Using the identity for \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\), we substitute and simplify:
\[
abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000
\]
This leads to the equation:
\[
xyz = 0
\]
where \(x = a - 100\), \(y = b - 100\), and \(z = c - 100\). This implies at least one of \(a, b, c\) must be 100.

We then count the number of triples where at least one of \(a, b, c\) is 100 using inclusion-exclusion principle:
- Number of triples with \(a = 100\): 201
- Similarly for \(b = 100\) and \(c = 100\): 201 each
- Subtract cases where two variables are 100: 3 cases, each leading to the same triple (100, 100, 100)
- Add back the case where all three are 100

Using inclusion-exclusion:
\[
3 \times 201 - 3 \times 1 + 1 = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601
\]

Thus, the number of triples is \(\boxed{601}\).
