Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that z is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, I can represent z as 4 times e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can write z as a + bi, but since |z| = 4, a² + b² = 16. Maybe using polar form will be easier here because it might make the expression more manageable.

Wait, the expression involves both z and 1/z. Since |z| = 4, |1/z| = 1/4. So, 1/z is (1/(4)) e^{-iθ} if z is 4 e^{iθ}. That might be helpful. Let me try to express everything in terms of θ.

Let me denote z as 4 e^{iθ}, where θ is a real number. Then, 1/z is (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Now, substituting into the expression:

(75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z
= (75 + 117i)(4 e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4 e^{-iθ})
= [ (75 * 4) + (117 * 4)i ] e^{iθ} + [ (96 / 4) + (144 / 4)i ] e^{-iθ}
= [300 + 468i] e^{iθ} + [24 + 36i] e^{-iθ}

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to compute this expression and then find the real part, which I'll denote as Re[...]. Let me compute each part separately.

First, let me compute [300 + 468i] e^{iθ}. The expression e^{iθ} is cosθ + i sinθ. So, multiplying the complex number (300 + 468i) by (cosθ + i sinθ).

Similarly, [24 + 36i] e^{-iθ} can be written as (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me compute each multiplication:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
But i^2 is -1, so:
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ

Similarly, the real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ, and the imaginary part is 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36 i^2 sinθ
Again, i^2 is -1:
= 24 cosθ + ( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ )i + 36 sinθ

So, the real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ, and the imaginary part is (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Now, adding both terms together:

Real parts: [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts: [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ] + [ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ ]
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

Wait, but the problem only asks for the real part, so I can ignore the imaginary part. So, the
