Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. That makes sense, so ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the exsymmedian point or something like that. Hmm, not sure about the exact term, but I know that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if I draw tangents at B and C, they will each be perpendicular to the radii OB and OC, respectively, where O is the center of ω.

Next, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. So, starting from A, drawing a line to D, which is outside the circle, and this line will intersect the circle again at P. The problem gives the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, which is the length from A to P, and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Alright, so first, maybe I should find some key properties or use some theorems here. Since we're dealing with tangents and circles, power of a point might be useful. Also, since P lies on the circumcircle, perhaps some cyclic quadrilateral properties or intersecting chords theorem could come into play.

Let me jot down the given lengths: AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. So triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me check if it's a right-angled triangle. 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10² = 100, so no, it's not right-angled. Hmm.

First, perhaps I should compute some angles or other lengths in triangle ABC. Maybe using the Law of Cosines to find angles or the circumradius. The Law of Cosines can help me find the angles, which could be useful later.

Let me compute the semi-perimeter of triangle ABC. s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, using Heron's formula, the area of triangle ABC is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, that's not a whole number, but maybe I can write it as 4*sqrt(63/2) = 4*(3*sqrt(14)/sqrt(2)) )= 4*(3*sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)) = 4*3*sqrt(7) = 12√7. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So sqrt(504). Let's factor 504:

504 = 16 * 31.5? No, wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is 63/2, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 504 = 16 * 31.5 isn't correct because 16*31.5 is 504. But perhaps factor it as 504 = 72 * 7. Because 72 *7 is 504. Then sqrt(504) = sqrt(72 *7) = sqrt(72)*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). So area is 6√14. That's better because Heron's formula gives sqrt(504) = 6√14.

Wait, wait, Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], which is sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504]. Let me compute the exact value:

12 * 7 = 84, 84 * 3 = 252, 252 * 2 = 504. So sqrt(504) is indeed equal to 6*sqrt(14) because 6^2 *14 = 36 *14 = 504. Right, so area is 6√14.

Alternatively, maybe using another formula like the area is (AB * AC * sin(theta))/2 where theta is the angle at A. But I think the Heron's formula is okay here.

Now, since we need to find AP, which is a segment from A to a point P on the circumcircle. So maybe using power of a point could help. The power of point A with respect to ω is zero because A is on ω. Wait, but in this case, AD is a secant line passing through A and P, so AP * AD = power of A, but since A is on the circle, power is zero, so AP * AD = 0? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something.

Wait, actually, the power of point D with respect to ω should be considered because D is outside the circle. The power of D is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from D to ω, which is DB^2 or DC^2 because DB and DC are tangents from D to ω. So, power of D is DB^2 = DC^2.

So, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so DB = DC. That's an important point. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Now, AD intersects ω again at P, so by the power of point D with respect to ω, we have DP * DA = DB^2. Because the power of D is DP * DA = DB^2.

So, we can write DP * DA = DB^2.

But we need to find AP, which is AD - DP? Wait, no. Wait
