Okay, let me try to figure out this problem about the torus and the sphere. Hmm, so we have a torus T created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape, right? And there's a sphere S with radius 11.

The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

First, I think I should visualize the torus and the sphere. The torus has a major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution. In this case, R is 6. The minor radius r is 3, which is the radius of the generating circle.

The sphere has a radius of 11, which is pretty large compared to the torus.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, it touches the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, touching along another circle. I need to find the radii of these two circles and subtract them.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. The torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere's center is outside the torus. The point of tangency is a circle. I think the radius of this circle, r_i, must be related to the distances between the centers of the sphere and torus.

Wait, maybe I should model the torus mathematically. The standard equation of a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is:

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = R ± sqrt((z^2 + r^2))

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, since the torus is a surface of revolution, perhaps I can think about the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center must be at a distance equal to the sphere's radius minus the minor radius of the torus? Or maybe not exactly, because the torus is a surface.

Wait, no. Let me think differently. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The torus's surface is tangent to the sphere. So the distance from the sphere's center to the point of tangency on the torus is 11.

But the torus itself has a major radius of 6 and minor radius 3. So the distance from the sphere's center to the center of the generating circle of the torus must be such that the point of tangency is at a distance of 11.

Hmm, perhaps I can model the torus as a surface where any point on the torus satisfies the equation:

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = R ± sqrt(z^2 + r^2)

Wait, I think the general equation for a
