Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make Bob the winner, assuming he plays optimally.

Hmm, let me think. This seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing. A winning position means the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the key is to find all n where the starting position is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can always win. Let's try to model this.

Let's denote the losing positions as P-positions and the winning positions as N-positions. The idea is that if a player is faced with a P-position, they will lose if both play optimally. Conversely, if faced with an N-position, the player can force a win.

We start by examining small n values to see if a pattern emerges.

n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice. So n=1 is N-position.

n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob has to take 1 and loses because Alice took the last one. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, Bob is forced to take that 1 and win? No, wait, because whoever takes the last token wins. So let's clarify.

Wait, if n=2, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. But 4 is more than 2, so she can only take 1. Then n becomes 1, Bob's turn. Bob takes 1 and wins. So for n=2, Alice is forced to take 1, then Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a P-position. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, that contradicts my initial thought. Let me double-check. So for n=2: Alice must take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't win if n=2. So n=2 is a P-position.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2. Now, from the previous analysis, n=2 is a P-position, meaning Bob is in a losing position. Wait, but if Alice leaves Bob with a P-position, then Bob cannot win, meaning Alice can force a win. So n=3 is an N-position.

Wait, let me make this more precise. Let's think step by step.

n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So Alice can win. So n=1 is N.

n=2: Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't win, so n=2 is P.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving n=2 (P-position for Bob), so Bob is in a losing position. So Alice can force a win by taking 1. So n=3 is N.

Wait, but let me think again. If n=3, Alice can take 1, leaving 2, which is a P-position. So Bob is in a losing position. So n=3 is N.

n=4: Alice can take 4 and win immediately. So n=4 is N.

n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 (N-position). Bob can then take 4 and win. Alternatively, Alice can take 4, leaving 1, which is N-position, so Bob can take 1 and win. Wait, but that would mean that for n=5, any move Alice makes allows Bob to win. So n=5 is P-position.

Wait, but that can't be right because if from n=5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4. But 4 is an N-position, which means the player whose turn
