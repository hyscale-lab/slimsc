Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis.

Now, the problem mentions four points A, B, C, and D on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the infimum of BD², the lower bound for BD squared, since it's the greatest number less than all possible BD².

Wait, no, actually, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, I think it's the infimum or the minimum possible value of BD². Because if I can find the minimum BD², then that would be the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that later.

But first, let's recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in fact, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I'm confusing with a square. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. No, wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola as well. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes.

So, let's consider
