Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given some conditions. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The problem says: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. We need to find xy.

Hmm, let me write down what I know.

First, logarithm properties. Remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So maybe I can use that to simplify both equations.

So starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using that property, this should be x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, because log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y). So that's equal to 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Which would be 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. Now, I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x).

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So substituting into the equations:

1. x * A = 10
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

So from equation 1: x * A = 10 => x = 10 / A.

From equation 2: 4y * (1/A) = 10 => 4y / A = 10 => y = (10 * A) / 4 => y = (5A)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of A. Let me write that down:

x = 10 / A

y = (5A) / 2

Now, since both x and y are greater than 1, I should make sure that these expressions satisfy that. So x = 10 / A > 1 => 10 / A > 1 => A < 10. Similarly, y = (5A)/2 > 1 => 5A/2 > 1 => A > 2/5. So A must be between 2/5 and 10.

But that's something to check later; for now, let's proceed.

Now, I think I can relate x and y through another logarithmic identity. Since we have log_x(y) = A, that means y = x^A.

Because if log_x(y) = A, then y = x^A.

So, substituting x from earlier, which is 10 / A, into this equation:

y = (10 / A)^A.

But wait, from before, we have y = (5A)/2.

So putting these two expressions for y together:

(5A)/2 = (10 / A)^A.

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of A. Let me write that:

(5A)/2 = (10 / A)^A.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to solve for A.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln( (5A)/2 ) = A * ln(10 / A).

Hmm, so ln(5A/2) = A * [ln(10) - ln(A)].

Expanding the right side:

ln(5A/2) = A ln(10) - A ln(A).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can rearrange terms.

Let me bring everything to one side:

A ln(A) - A ln(10) + ln(5A/2) = 0.

Not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this equation in terms of A.

Wait, perhaps instead of using natural logarithm, I can use logarithm base 10, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can make a substitution.

Let me set t = A. So the equation is:

ln(5t/2) = t [ln(10) - ln t].

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have an algebraic solution. So perhaps I'd need to solve for t numerically.

Alternatively, maybe I can find an integer value of A that satisfies this equation.

Let me test A=2.

Left side: ln(5*2/2) = ln(5) ≈1.6094.

Right side: 2*(ln(10) - ln(2)) ≈2*(2.3026 - 0.6931)=2*(1.6095)=3.219.

Not equal, so A=2 is not a solution.

How about A=1?

Left: ln(5/2) ≈0.9163.

Right: 1*(ln10 - ln1)=ln10 -0=2.3026. Not equal.

What about A=3.

Left: ln(15/2)=ln(7.5)≈2.015.

Right:3*(ln10 - ln3)=3*(2.3026 -1.0986)=3*(1.204)=3.612. Not equal.

Hmm, not matching. Maybe A
