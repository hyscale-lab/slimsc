Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, let me write down what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem says f(x) is ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract some constant, and then take the absolute value again. That probably means they're piecewise linear functions with possible V-shapes.

Let me sketch f(x) and g(x) mentally. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, the inner absolute value |x| creates a V-shape centered at 0. Subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, but since we take the absolute value again, it will create another V. So, f(x) will have its vertex at the point where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is x = ±1/2. So, f(x) has two vertices at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. The same logic applies to g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, but shifted less, so vertices at x = ±1/4.

Now, the functions inside y and x are compositions of these f and g functions with sine and cosine functions, respectively. Let's take it step by step.

Starting with y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's parse this function:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1 because the coefficient is 2π, which is the standard period for sine. So, sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 1. It's a standard sine wave.

2. Then, compute f of this sine value: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So, subtracting 1/2 gives a value between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, f(sin(...)) will be between 0 and 1/2. So, f(sin(2πx)) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with some shape.

3. Next, compute g of that: g(f(sin(...))) = ||f(sin(...))| - 1/4|. Since f(sin(...)) is between 0 and 1/2, subtracting 1/4 gives a range from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking absolute value, g(f(sin(...))) will be between 0 and 1/4.

4. Finally, multiply by 4: y = 4 * g(f(sin(...))). So, 4*(something between 0 and 1/4) gives y between 0 and 1. So, the entire function y is a transformed version of the sine function, but with this f and g applied.

Similarly, for x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))):

1. Start with cos(3πy). The cosine function has a period of (2π)/(3π) = 2/3. So, it's a cosine wave oscillating between -1 and 1, with a period of 2/3.

2. Compute f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. Again, |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, so f(cos(...)) will be between 0 and 1/2.

3. Then, compute g of that: g(f(cos(...))) = ||f(cos(...)) - 1/4|. The result is between 0 and 1/4.

4. Multiply by 4: x = 4 * g(f(cos(...))), so x is between 0 and 1.

So, both y and x are functions that oscillate between 0 and 1, but with different frequencies because their arguments have different periods.

Now, the problem is to find the number of intersections between these two graphs: y as a function of x, and x as a function of y. But wait, actually, in the problem statement, it's y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So, the first equation is y in terms of x, and the second is x in terms of y. So, to find their intersections, we need to find all pairs (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied.

So, in other words, we need to solve the system:
y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

This seems a bit tricky because it's a system of equations where each variable is defined in terms of the other. Let me think how to approach this.

One way is to substitute one equation into the other. For example, express y from the first equation and substitute into the second equation, but since the second equation defines x in terms of y, which itself is in terms of x, it might lead to a complicated equation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that each function is a transformation of a sine or cosine, and see how they relate.

Alternatively, perhaps we can analyze the possible ranges of x and y. Both functions, y and x, are between 0 and 1. So, x ∈ [0, 1] and y ∈ [0, 1].

Additionally, the functions are periodic but with different frequencies. The function y depends on x through sin(2πx), which has period 1. The function x depends on y through cos(3πy), which has period 2/3.

Hmm, so we have a system where y is a function of x with period 1, and x is a function of y with period 2/3. So, perhaps the entire system has a period of 1, since 1 is a multiple of 2/3.

But perhaps I can look for symmetry or other properties.

Wait, maybe I can plot or think about the behavior of these functions.

But since I can't plot right now, maybe I can consider how often these functions change direction or cross each other.

Alternatively, perhaps I can analyze the equations by considering possible values of x and y.

Let me first try to figure out the expressions for f and g.

Let me write f(x) as ||x| - 1/2|. Let me think about the graph of f(x). For x ≥ 0, f(x) = |x - 1/2|.

So, for x ≥ 0:

- When x < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - x
- When x ≥ 1/2, f(x) = x - 1/2

Similarly, for x < 0, since |x| is -x, f(x) = |-x - 1/2| = |x + 1/2|. So, for x < 0:

- When x > -1/2, f(x) = -x - 1/2 (Wait, no. Wait, |x + 1/2| is always positive.

Wait, no, for x <0, f(x) = | |x| -1/2 |. Since |x| is -x, because x is negative. So, f(x) = | (-x) - 1/2 | = | - (x + 1/2)| = |x + 1/2|.

So, for x < 0, f
