Okay, so I have this problem where Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop, and the time she spends there is t minutes. The problem gives me two scenarios about her walking speed and the total time taken, including t minutes. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I should probably figure out what her walking speed s is. Because if I can find s, then I can calculate the time for the third scenario.

The problem says when she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes. Wait, so the total time is 4 hours, which includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which I should convert to hours to make calculations easier.

Let me write down the equations based on this information.

First scenario:
Walking speed = s km/h
Total time = 4 hours = 4 hours
This total time includes both walking and t minutes. So, the actual walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. But wait, t is in minutes, so I need to convert that to hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, walking time for the first scenario is (4 - t/60) hours.

But the walking time can also be calculated as distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km, so walking time is 9/s hours.

So the equation for the first scenario is:
9/s = 4 - (t/60)    ...(1)

Second scenario:
Walking speed = (s + 2) km/h
Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.

Similarly, the walking time is (2.4 - t/60) hours.

Again, walking time is distance divided by speed, so 9/(s + 2) hours.

So the equation for the second scenario is:
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)    ...(2)

Now, I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these equations to find s and t.

Let me write equations (1) and (2) again:

From (1):
9/s = 4 - t/60

From (2):
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

I can rearrange both equations to express t in terms of s, then set them equal to each other.

From equation (1):
4 - (9/s) = t/60
So, t = 60*(4 - 9/s) = 240 - (540/s)    ...(3)

From equation (2):
2.4 - (9/(s + 2)) = t/60
So, t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s + 2)) = 144 - (540/(s + 2))    ...(4)

Now, since both (3) and (4) equal t, I can set them equal to each other:

240 - (540/s) = 144 - (540/(s + 2))

Let me simplify this equation.

First, subtract 144 from both sides:

240 - 144 - (540/s) = - (540/(s + 2))

Which is:

96 - (540/s) = -540/(s + 2)

Let me bring all terms to one side:

96 = (540/s) - 540/(s + 2)

Factor out 540:

96 = 540*(1/s - 1/(s + 2))

Simplify inside the parentheses:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) ) = 2/(s(s + 2))

So, 96 = 540*(2/(s(s + 2)))

Simplify:

96 = (1080)/(s(s + 2))

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

96 * s(s + 2) = 1080

Divide both sides by 96 to simplify:

s(s + 2) = 1080 / 96

Let me compute 1080 divided by 96. Hmm, 96 x 11 = 1056, so 1080 - 1056 = 24, so 11 + 24/96 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Which is a quadratic equation:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant D = 2^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So, sqrt(D) = 7

Thus, s = [-2 ±7]/2

We can discard the negative solution since speed can't be negative.

So, s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

Wait, that seems a bit slow for a walking speed, but maybe it's okay.

So, s = 2.5 km/h

Now, let's find t.

Using equation (3):

t = 240 - (540/s) = 240 - (540/2.5)

Compute 540/2.5: 540 divided by 2.5 is the same as 54
