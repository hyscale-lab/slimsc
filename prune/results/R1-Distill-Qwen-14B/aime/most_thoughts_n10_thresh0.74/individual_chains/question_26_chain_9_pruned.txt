Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. That means the circle is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. The circle ω passes through all three points. Tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, line AD intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside the circle, the lengths of these tangents are equal. So, point D is the external point from which two tangents DB and DC are drawn to the circle. So, DB = DC. That might come in handy later.

Since we're dealing with a triangle and its circumcircle, perhaps some theorems related to circles, chords, and tangents might be useful here. For example, the Power of a Point theorem. That could be helpful because point D lies outside the circle, and we have tangents and secants from D.

Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the length of the tangent from D to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points of intersection of a secant with the circle. In this case, the tangent lengths are DB and DC, which are equal, so DB² = DC². The secant here would be D-A-P, which intersects the circle at A and P. So, the Power of Point D with respect to ω is DB² = DA * DP.

Wait, let me make sure I get this right. So, Power of a Point gives us DB² = DA * DP. Because DA is the part from D to A, and DP is from D to P. Since AD intersects the circle again at P, DP is the entire secant. So, yes, DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, and then express DA in terms of AP, I can solve for AP. Alternatively, since AP is the segment we're trying to find, maybe I can express DP in terms of AP. Let me think.

Let me assign variables. Let me denote AP as x. Then, since AP is part of AD, the entire length AD would be AP + PD. Wait, or is it the other way around? No, because A is on the circle, and P is the other intersection point, so starting from D, the line goes through A and then P. So, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DA and DP are in the same line, with A between D and P. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P, which is DA + AP. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The line is D-A-P, so D is outside, A is on the circle, and P is the other intersection point beyond A. So, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which passes through A. So, DP = DA + AP. Therefore, DP = DA + x, where x is AP.

But according to Power of a Point, DB² = DA * DP. So, DB² = DA * (DA + x). Hmm, but I don't know DA yet. Maybe I can express DA in terms of other variables.

Wait, but perhaps I can use Stewart's theorem or
