Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis length is sqrt(20), and the conjugate axis is sqrt(24). 

The problem says that points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at (0,0). 

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. But wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at 90 degrees? Wait, no, that's in a square or a kite. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me double-check. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's a property I can use.

So
