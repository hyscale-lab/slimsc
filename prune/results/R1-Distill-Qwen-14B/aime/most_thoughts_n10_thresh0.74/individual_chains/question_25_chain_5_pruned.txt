Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that when dealing with sets and their overlaps, the principle of inclusion-exclusion is super useful. I think that's the right approach here. Let me recall the formula for four sets. I know for two sets, it's |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. But for four sets, it's more complicated. Let me see if I can remember or derive it.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the given information. We have 900 residents, each owning at least a bag of candy hearts. So every resident owns at least one of the four items, but actually, the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's like a universal set here—everyone has at least that. So that might simplify things a bit because we don't have to worry about people who don't have any of the four.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, candy hearts are a given for everyone. So the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are optional. So, all residents have at least the candy hearts. So when the problem talks about owning exactly two or three things, it's only considering the other three items because the candy hearts are already included in everyone's ownership.

So, let me clarify the data:

- Total residents, n = 900.
- Number who own a diamond ring, D = 195.
- Number who own golf clubs, G = 367.
- Number who own garden spade, S = 562.
- Everyone owns candy hearts, so C is universal, so |C| = 900.

But since the candy hearts are universal, when we talk about someone owning exactly two things, it's exactly two of the other three (D, G, S) plus C. So, each person owns at least C, so their ownership can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 items. But the problem says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things and 234 who own exactly three. Wait, but the four things include C, right? So, if someone owns exactly two of the four, that includes C. Or does it?

Wait, hold on. The problem says: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the four "things" are C, D, G, S. But each resident has at least C. So, when they say 437 own exactly two of these things, that includes C. So, someone who owns exactly two could be, for example, C and D, or C and G, etc. Similarly, those who own exactly three things include C plus two others, or all three others.

So, the problem is about four sets but C is universal. So, let me rephrase the problem in terms of the three optional sets D, G, S
