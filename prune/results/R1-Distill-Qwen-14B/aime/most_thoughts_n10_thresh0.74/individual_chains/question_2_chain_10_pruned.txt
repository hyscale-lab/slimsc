Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and digest the information.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, and A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), while B is somewhere along the y-axis, about 0.866 units up.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis. So PQ is a line segment from some point (p, 0) to (0, q), with the condition that the length of PQ is 1. 

I remember that the length of a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²). So since it's of unit length, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which implies p² + q² = 1. So the coordinates of P and Q have to lie on the unit circle. So each such segment PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1.

Now, there's a point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is in F.

So C is on AB, but it's unique in that no other segment from F passes through it except AB. So my task is to find this point C on AB, find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, so let me visualize this. The line AB connects A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So the equation of line AB can be found.

First, let's find the equation of AB. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So any point C on AB can be represented as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). Let me denote this point as C(x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, I need to find the point C on AB such that no other segment PQ from F passes through it except AB.

So, if I can find the point C where, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, in other words, C is the point on AB that is not intersected by any other segment PQ in F except for AB itself.

So, how do I approach this? Maybe I can think about the envelope of all these segments PQ or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize all possible segments PQ and find where they would intersect AB, then find the point C on AB that is the only intersection point with AB from all these PQs.

Wait, but for our problem, we need to find the point C on AB that is not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, it's the point where all other PQs in F do not pass through. So, to find such a point, perhaps it's the point where the envelope of the family F touches AB.

Alternatively, maybe it's the point where the envelope of the family F is tangent to AB, meaning that only AB passes through that point, and all other PQs don't.

Hmm, I might need to parametrize the family F and find the envelope.

Let me parametrize all the segments PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis.

Let me let P be (p, 0) and Q be (0, q), with p² + q² = 1, as earlier.

So, the equation of the line PQ can be found. Let's find the equation of PQ.

The line PQ connects (p,0) and (0,q). The slope is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Alternatively, we can write it as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, since it's intercept form.

So, for each (p, q) on the unit circle, we have a line (x/p) + (y/q) = 1.

Our goal is to find the envelope of this family of lines. The envelope is a curve that touches each member of the family. So, perhaps the envelope is a parabola or some other conic.

Once I have the envelope, I can find where it intersects AB. Then, the point C is the one intersection point where the envelope is tangent to AB, meaning only AB passes through
