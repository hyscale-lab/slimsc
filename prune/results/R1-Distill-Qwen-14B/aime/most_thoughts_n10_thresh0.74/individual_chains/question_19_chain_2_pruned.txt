Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumradius (R) is 13, the inradius (r) is 6, and the incenter I is perpendicular to the line OI, where O is the circumcenter. Hmm, that's interesting. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in any triangle, the circumradius R relates to the sides and the area. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. And the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter, given by r = Δ/s, where s = (a+b+c)/2.

Given that R is 13 and r is 6, I can write those down:

R = 13
r = 6

I also know that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line joining the incenter I and the circumcenter O. That seems like a crucial piece of information. Maybe I can find some relationship using this perpendicularity.

Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Oh, yes, that's right! The formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, in this case, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me compute that.

13 squared is 169, and 2*13*6 is 156. So, OI² = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). That's a useful value.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle IOA, we have OI perpendicular to IA, meaning by Pythagoras theorem, IA² + OI² = OA². Wait, but OA is the circumradius, right? Since O is the circumcenter, OA is just R, which is 13. So, OA = 13.

So, substituting the known values into Pythagoras:

IA² + OI² = OA²
IA² + 13 = 13²
IA² + 13 = 169
IA² = 169 - 13 = 156
So, IA = sqrt(156). Let me see if that can be simplified. 156 is 4*39, which is 4*3*13, so sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Okay, so IA = 2√39.

Wait, but IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I think there's a formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex. Let me recall. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r /
