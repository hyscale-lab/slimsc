Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting certain vertices. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact method, so I should think this through carefully.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, the vertices are equally spaced around a circle. That should help in figuring out the distances between vertices, which are essentially the lengths of the sides and diagonals.

I know that in a regular polygon, a diagonal is a line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. The length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices apart they are. So in a dodecagon, for each vertex, there are diagonals of different lengths connecting it to vertices 2, 3, ..., up to 5 steps away (since beyond that, it's the same as connecting the other way around the polygon). Wait, actually, for a 12-gon, the diagonals can be categorized based on how many edges they skip. So the diagonals can be of lengths corresponding to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 edges apart. But wait, when you connect two vertices that are 6 edges apart, that's actually a diameter of the circumscribed circle, right? Because 12/2 =6. So in a 12-gon, the maximum distance between two vertices is 6, which is the diameter.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. For a quadrilateral to be a rectangle, not only must the sides be at right angles, but also the opposite sides must be equal and parallel. In the case of a regular dodecagon, since all sides and angles are equal, we can form rectangles by selecting pairs of vertices that are opposite each other across the center.

Wait, but how exactly? Let me think. If I pick two parallel sides or two parallel diagonals, then their midpoints should be such that they can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. Alternatively, perhaps we can think about choosing two pairs of points that are symmetric with respect to the center of the dodecagon.

Another approach is to think in terms of coordinates. Since it's a regular polygon, I could assign coordinates to each vertex based on the unit circle. Then, each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. The angle between each vertex is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, vertex 1 is at 0 degrees, vertex 2 at 30 degrees, vertex 3 at 60 degrees, and so on, up to vertex 12 at 330 degrees.

Now, a rectangle can be formed by four points such that the midpoints of the diagonals coincide, and the sides are perpendicular. So, in other words, if I have four points A, B, C, D, forming a rectangle, then the midpoint of AC should be the same as the midpoint of BD, and the vectors AB and AD should be perpendicular.

But perhaps an easier way is to consider the properties of the regular dodecagon. Since it's regular, the number of rectangles can be determined by the number of pairs of parallel sides and the number of pairs of parallel diagonals that can be combined to form rectangles.

Wait, in a regular polygon, rectangles are formed by two pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. So, perhaps I should count how many pairs of parallel sides or diagonals there are, and then for each pair, count how many other pairs are perpendicular to them, and then multiply for each case.

Alternatively, another method is to recognize that in a regular dodecagon, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose two distinct pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that are perpendicular
