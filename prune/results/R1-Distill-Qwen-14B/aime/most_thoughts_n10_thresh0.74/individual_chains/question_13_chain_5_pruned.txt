Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked. 

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. There are two scenarios given:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the entire walk takes her 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, the total time from when she starts walking until she leaves the coffee shop is 4 hours, and t of those minutes are in the coffee shop.

2. When she walks at a speed of 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes in the coffee shop. So, similar to the first scenario, the total time from start to finish is 2 hours and 24 minutes, with t minutes being coffee time.

The question is asking: Suppose Aya walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Our goal is to find the total time for the walk when her speed is s + 0.5 km/h, including the coffee break.

Alright, let me break this down. 

First, let's note the key information:

- Distance walked: 9 km
- First speed: s km/h, total time including coffee: 4 hours
- Second speed: (s + 2) km/h, total time including coffee: 2 hours 24 minutes
- Third speed: (s + 1/2) km/h, find total time including coffee.

I think we can model this with equations. Since the total time includes both walking and the coffee break, we'll need to separate the walking time from the coffee time.

Let me denote:

For the first scenario, walking speed s:

- Let T1 be the total time, which is 4 hours. But this includes the coffee time, which is t minutes. So, the actual walking time is T1 minus the coffee time.

Similarly, for the second scenario, walking speed s + 2:

- Let T2 be the total time, which is 2 hours 24 minutes. Again, this includes coffee time t, so the actual walking time is T2 minus t.

Wait, but the problem says "the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So the total time from starting the walk until she leaves the coffee shop is 4 hours, which includes the walking time plus the coffee time. So, yes, the walking time is T1 minus t. But wait, actually, more precisely, the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop equals the total time.

So, in the first case:

Walking time + coffee time = 4 hours.

Similarly, in the second case:

Walking time + coffee time = 2 hours 24 minutes.

Wait a minute, but coffee time is the same in both cases, right? Because t is a fixed amount of time she spends in the coffee shop, regardless of her walking speed.
