Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. Hmm. We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Interesting. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the problem. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly for EFGH. So, AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16, FG = EH = 17, and EF = GH = 184.

Wait, but the rectangles are drawn such that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D and C are from rectangle ABCD, and E and F are from rectangle EFGH. So, maybe the rectangles are placed next to each other along this line? Hmm.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's a cyclic quadrilateral. So, the four points lie on a single circle. Maybe we can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch. I imagine rectangle ABCD with AB=107 and BC=16. So, the sides are 107 and 16. Let's say ABCD is placed such that AB is the base, so A is at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, D is the top left corner.

Now, rectangle EFGH: Similarly, EF=184 and FG=17. So, EF is the base, which is longer than AB. Let me place E at the bottom left of EFGH, F at the bottom right, G at the top right, and H at the top left.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the points D and C must lie on the line EF. Wait, but EF is the base of rectangle EFGH. Hmm, so maybe the line D-E-C-F is along EF? Or perhaps EF is a different line? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, EF is a side of the rectangle EFGH. So, EF is horizontal if EFGH is a rectangle. So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, they must lie on a straight line. But E and F are corners of EFGH. Hmm.

Let me think. Let's suppose that the line D-E-C-F is a straight line. So, point D is a corner of ABCD, E is a corner of EFGH, C is a corner of ABCD, and F is a corner of EFGH. So, this line passes through D, E, C, F in that order.

So, in this case, the line could be the base of both rectangles? But wait, ABCD has base AB=107, and EFGH has base EF=184. Hmm, but EF is longer than AB. So, maybe the line is longer than AB.

Wait, perhaps the rectangles are placed next to each other along this line. So, maybe ABCD is placed in such a way that side AD is vertical, and the line DC is part of the line D-E-C-F, which is horizontal.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, DC is the top side, which is equal to AB=107. So, DC is 107 units long. Similarly, EF is 184. So, the line D-E-C-F is 107 + 184 = 291 units long? Or maybe not, because E and F are on the same line, but they might not be directly attached to ABCD.

Alternatively, perhaps the line D-E-C-F is the same as the line DC for ABCD, but with E and F somewhere along
