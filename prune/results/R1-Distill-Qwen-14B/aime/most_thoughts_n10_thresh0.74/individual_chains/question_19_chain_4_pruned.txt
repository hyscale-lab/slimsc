Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the circumradius is 13 and the inradius is 6. Also, the line IA is perpendicular to OI, where O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me recall some basic properties about triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The incenter I is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. In this triangle, IA is perpendicular to OI, which is an interesting condition. I wonder how that affects the triangle's properties.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, let me confirm that. I think for a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumradius is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me check that formula. Yes, I think that's correct. So if I plug in R=13 and r=6, I can find OI.

Calculating that: OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, that's a nice number.

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I. So triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle with legs IO and IA, and hypotenuse OA. Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13, right? Because O is the circumcenter, so OA = OB = OC = 13.

So, in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras:

OA² = IO² + IA²

We know OA is 13, so OA² is 169. IO² is 13, so:

169 = 13 + IA² → IA² = 156 → IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay.

But wait, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I know that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides. Let me recall the formula for IA.

I think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Let me confirm that. Yes, I believe that's correct. So IA = r / sin(A/2).

So, from earlier, IA is 2*sqrt(39). So:

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)

Solving for sin(A/2):

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13. Right.

So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Then, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

Wait, 130 is 13*10, so sqrt(130) is sqrt(13*10) = sqrt(13)*sqrt(10). Hmm, okay.

Now, in a triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. Similarly, the area
