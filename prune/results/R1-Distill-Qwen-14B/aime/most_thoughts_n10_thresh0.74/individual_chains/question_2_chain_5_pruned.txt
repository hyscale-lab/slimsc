Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, a bit more than halfway since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Then, there's a family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So each segment PQ starts on the x-axis, ends on the y-axis, and has length 1.

The key part is that there's a unique point C on AB, other than A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. We need to find OC², express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm. So, first, maybe I should visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle? Wait, O is (0,0), A is (1/2, 0), and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2, and AB is the distance between A and B.

Wait, what's the distance between A and B? Let's compute that. The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So for A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2):

Distance AB = sqrt[(0 - 1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1.

Oh, so AB is a segment of length 1, and it's part of the family F. So AB is one of those PQ segments. So the family F includes all such segments with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, length 1.

Wait, but how are these PQ segments arranged? Each such segment would have P at (p,0) and Q at (0,q), with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, since the length is 1. So p and q are points such that p² + q² = 1, with p, q > 0 because they're in the first quadrant.

So each PQ segment is a line from (p,0) to (0,q), where p and q are positive numbers satisfying p² + q² = 1. So these are like all possible lines of length 1 in the first quadrant, with endpoints on the axes.

Now, the problem says that for each such PQ, it's a segment in F. Then, point C is on AB, distinct from A and B, such that it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is one of these PQ segments, and C is a point on AB that isn't on any other PQ in F. So, C is the unique point on AB that is only on AB and no other segments from F.

We need to find OC squared.

So, perhaps the first step is to parametrize AB. Let's write the equation of AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parametrized. Let me find the equation of AB.

The slope (m) of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

Now, the point C is supposed to lie only on AB and no other segments from F. So, if I can find the point C such that for all other segments PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of it as the envelope of all these segments PQ; the point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope
