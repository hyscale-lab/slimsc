Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The problem is about finding the greatest four-digit number, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when I divide N by 1000, I get a quotient Q and a remainder R, and I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number with this specific property. The property is that changing any one digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That's interesting. So for example, if N is abc d (in digits), then changing a to 1, or b to 1, or c to 1, or d to 1, in any of those positions, the number becomes divisible by 7.

So, my goal is to find the maximum four-digit number N where this is true. Then, I have to compute Q and R when N is divided by 1000, which is essentially the thousands digit and the last three digits. So Q is the first digit, and R is the remaining three digits. Then, adding them together.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this. Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = WXYZ, where W, X, Y, Z are its digits. So W is the thousands digit, X is the hundreds, Y is the tens, and Z is the units.

Now, according to the problem, if I change any one digit of N to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

So, let's consider each case:

1. Changing W to 1: The number becomes 1XYZ. So, 1XYZ must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing X to 1: The number becomes W1YZ. So, W1YZ must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing Y to 1: The number becomes WXY1. So, WXY1 must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing Z to 1: The number becomes WXYZ1? Wait, no, wait, N is a four-digit number, so changing Z to 1 would make it WXY1, which is four digits. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, so N is four digits, so changing any digit to 1, regardless of position, gives another four-digit number which is divisible by 7.

So, to rephrase, the four-digit number N has the property that replacing any one of its digits with 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit, replacing it with 1 gives a multiple of 7.

Moreover, since we need the greatest such four-digit number, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find the first number that satisfies this condition.

But since that might be time-consuming, perhaps we can find some properties or constraints that N must satisfy.

Let me think about the implications. For each digit, replacing it with 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, for each position, the original number differs from a multiple of 7 by a certain amount.

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote the four-digit number as N = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z.

When we replace the thousands digit W with 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100X + 10Y + Z = 1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z. Let's call this N1.

Similarly, replacing X with 1 gives N2 = 1000W + 100*1 + 10Y + Z = 1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z.

Replacing Y with 1 gives N3 = 1000W + 100X + 10*1 + Z = 1000W + 100X + 10 + Z.

Replacing Z with 1 gives N4 = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me write these congruences:

1. (1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z) ≡ 0 mod 7

2. (1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z) ≡ 0 mod 7

3. (1000W + 100X + 10 + Z) ≡ 0 mod 7

4. (1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Now, since N is 1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z, let's denote N as N = 1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z.

We can rewrite each of the above congruences in terms of N.

Let's see:

1. N1 = 1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z = (1000W + 100X + 10Y + Z) - 1000(W - 1)

So, N1 = N - 1000(W - 1)

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each N1, N2, N3, N4 in terms of N.

Wait, let's see:

N1 is changing W to 1. So, N
