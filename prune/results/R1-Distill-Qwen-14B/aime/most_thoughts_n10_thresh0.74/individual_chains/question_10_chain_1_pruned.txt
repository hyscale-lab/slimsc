Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers, and Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of sets Bob lists is 2024, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me parse this. So, A is a set of positive integers. Then, for each element a in A, Bob considers all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is exactly a. Then, he lists all such possible Bs.

Wait, no, actually, I think it's all B such that the maximum element of B is in A. So B can have any elements, but its maximum must be an element of A.

So, for example, if A is {1}, then the only possible B is {1} because any other set would have a maximum greater than 1, which isn't in A.

If A is {1,2}, then Bob's list includes all non-empty sets whose maximum is 1 or 2. So, for each a in A, the number of sets where the maximum is a is 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, the other elements of B can be any subset of {1,2,...,a-1}, and we exclude the empty set since B must be non-empty.

Wait, actually, for each a, the number of sets B where the maximum is exactly a is equal to the number of subsets of {1,2,...,a-1}, because for each such subset, you can add a to it to get a set with maximum a. Since the subsets can be empty, but B must be non-empty. Wait, no, because if you take the empty subset and add a, then B would be {a}, which is non-empty. So the number of such sets is 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets Bob lists is the sum over a in A of 2^{a - 1}. And according to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So, let me write this down:

Total number of sets = Σ (a ∈ A) 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of elements in A, which is Σ (a ∈ A) a.

So, we need to find a set A where the sum of 2^{a -1} for each
