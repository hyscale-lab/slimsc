Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3. Got that.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We're supposed to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Okay, so I need to figure out what r_i and r_o are. Let me think about the geometry here.

First, let's consider the torus inside the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the sphere must touch the torus along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere touches it along another circle.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, the centers of the spheres (if they are spheres) must lie along the same line, and the distance between their centers must equal the sum or difference of their radii. But wait, a torus isn't a sphere—it's more complicated. Maybe I need to model the torus as a surface of revolution and then find where it intersects the sphere.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's assume the torus is centered at the origin, and the sphere is also centered at the origin. That might simplify things.

The equation of a torus can be written in cylindrical coordinates as (R - sqrt(x^2 + y^2))^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius. Wait, actually, the standard equation in Cartesian coordinates is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

Where R is the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and r is the minor radius (radius of the tube itself). In our case, R is 6 and r is 3.

So, the torus equation is:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

And the sphere has radius 11, so its equation is:

x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere must contain the torus, and they touch along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, touching it along another circle.

Wait, no. When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, it's externally tangent? Or internally tangent? Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent. So, the torus is inside the sphere, touching it from the inside. When it's on the outside, the torus is outside the sphere, touching it from the outside.

Hmm, okay. So, for internal tangency, the sphere is larger, and the torus is entirely inside except for the tangent circle. For external tangency, the torus is larger? Wait, but the sphere has radius 11, and the torus has a major radius of 6 and minor radius 3. Let me think about the sizes.

The maximum distance from the origin to the torus is R + r = 6 + 3 = 9, and the minimum is R - r
