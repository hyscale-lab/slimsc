Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds pretty complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1, and also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

The expression I need to compute is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I notice that for each term in the product, it's a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor each term or find a way to relate it to cyclotomic polynomials or something similar.

Let me consider each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let's see if this can be rewritten in a more manageable form.

Let me factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. That might not help much. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k, so the term becomes 2 - 2x + x², which is x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic equation. Let me see if it factors.

The discriminant of x² - 2x + 2 is (-2)^2 - 8 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, each term can be written as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the entire product becomes:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i))

Which can be separated into two products:

Product = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] × [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))]

Now, I recall that the product over all ω^k - a, where ω is a primitive nth root of unity, is equal to Φ_n(a), the nth cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at a. Wait, is that right? Let me think.

Actually, the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive nth roots of unity, and it's given by the product of (x - ω^k) where ω is a primitive nth root and k runs through the integers from 1 to φ(n). But in our case, we're taking the product over k=0 to 12, which includes all 13th roots of unity, not just the primitive ones.

Wait, so since ω is a primitive 13th root, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x¹³ - 1, because the 13th roots of unity are the roots of x¹³ - 1. So, indeed, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹³ - 1.

So, in our case, the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) would be equal to a¹³ - 1, but with a sign. Let's check. If I set x = a, then ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a¹³ - 1. But in our case, the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = - (a¹³ - 1) = 1 - a¹³.

Wait, because when you factor out a negative sign from each term, you get (-1)^13 times the product of (a - ω^k), which is (-1)^13 (a¹³ - 1) = - (a¹³ - 1) = 1 - a¹³.

So, in our case, each of the two products is equal to 1 - a¹³ where a is (1 + i) and (1 - i).

Therefore, the first product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^13

Similarly, the second product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^13

So the
