Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop visits. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, first, the problem says that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, and this takes her 4 hours including 't' minutes she spends in the coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed to 's + 2' km/h, her walking time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, the question is asking what the total time would be if she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the 't' minutes.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, when her speed changes, the time she spends walking changes, but the time spent in the coffee shop remains the same. So, the difference in total time between the two scenarios is entirely due to the walking time.

First, I think I should write down the equations for both scenarios to find 's' and 't'.

In the first case, walking at speed 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours. But this includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. So, let's denote the walking time as T1 and coffee shop time as t. So,

T1 + t = 4 hours.

But T1 is the time she takes to walk 9 km at speed s. The formula for time is distance divided by speed. So,

T1 = 9 / s hours.

So, substituting that into the first equation:

9/s + t = 4.

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at speed (s + 2) km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that into hours to make calculations easier. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. So,

T2 + t = 2.4 hours.

Again, T2 is the walking time at the new speed. So,

T2 = 9 / (s + 2).

So the equation becomes:

9/(s + 2) + t = 2.4.

Now, I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t = 4

2) 9/(s + 2) + t = 2.4

I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 't'. Let's do that.

(9/s + t) - (9/(s + 2) + t) = 4 - 2.4

Simplifying the left side:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

So,

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = (s + 2 - s) / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So now,

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Simplify:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me write this as:

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Compute right side:

1.6 * s(s + 2) = 1.6 s² + 3.2 s

So,

18 = 1.6 s² + 3.2 s

Let me rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation:

1.6 s² + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, working with decimals can be a bit tricky, so maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimals:

16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, but 1.6 * 10 is 16, 3.2 *10 is 32, 18 *10 is 180. So, equation becomes:

16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0

Hmm, maybe I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by a common factor. Let me see: 16, 32, 180. All are divisible by 4.

Divide each term by 4:

4 s² + 8 s - 45 = 0

That's better. So, quadratic equation is 4s² +8s -45=0.

Let me try to solve for s using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form a s² + b s + c =0, where a=4, b=8, c=-45.

The quadratic formula is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a)

Compute discriminant first:

D = b² -4ac = (8)^2 -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

Square root of 784 is 28.

So,

s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2*4) = [ -8 ±28 ] /8

We have two solutions:

1) s = (-8 +28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

2) s = (-8 -28)/8 = -36/8 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, that seems a bit slow for a walking speed. Hmm, 2.5 km/h is about 1.55 miles per hour, which is a leisurely walking pace. Maybe it's okay for Aya's morning walk.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find 't' using one of the initial equations. Let's use the first one:

9/s + t =4.

So,

t = 4 - (9/s) 

Substituting s=2.5,

t =4 - (9/2.5)

Compute 9 divided by 2.5:

2.5 * 3 =7.5, 9-7.5=1.5. So, 9/2.5=3.6.

So,

t=4 -3.6=0.4 hours.

Convert 0.4 hours to minutes: 0.4 *60=24 minutes.

So, t=24 minutes.

Now, the question asks: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, her new speed is s + 0.5.

We have s=2.5, so new speed is 2.5 + 0.5 =3 km/h.

So, walking speed is 3 km/h.

Time taken to walk 9 km at 3 km/h is T3=9/3=3 hours.

Then, the total time including coffee shop is T3 + t.

Which is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes. 180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, but let me confirm: Alternatively, she could have walked 9 km at 3 km/h, which takes 3 hours, plus 24 minutes, so total 3h24m, which is 204 minutes.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it in hours and then convert to minutes.

Wait, 3h + 0.4h=3.4h. 3.4h is 3h24m, which is 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Wait,
