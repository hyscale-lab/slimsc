Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let me recall that for a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z, the surface area S is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) and the volume V is xyz. So in this case, S = 54 and V = 23. Got that.

Now, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, which is (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So my goal is to find the minimum value of r², which is equivalent to finding the minimum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² with the constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. xyz = 23

Hmm, okay. So this is an optimization problem with two constraints. I remember that for such problems, Lagrange multipliers can be used, but since it's a bit involved, maybe I can find a way to express variables in terms of others to reduce the number of variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some inequalities here. I recall that for positive real numbers, certain inequalities relate sums, products, and other symmetric functions.

Wait, let's think about symmetric functions. Maybe I can let x = y = z? But wait, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, x = 3. Then the volume would be x³ = 27. But the volume given is 23, which is less than 27. So a cube isn't the case here. Therefore, the box is not a cube, so the minimal sphere might not correspond to a cube. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sphere occurs when two sides are equal, making it a square prism or something. Maybe assuming symmetry in two variables could simplify the problem. Let me try setting y = z and see if that works.

Let me define y = z. Then, the surface area becomes 2(xy + y² + xy) = 2(2xy + y²) = 4xy + 2y² = 54. The volume is x y² = 23.

So, let's write down the equations:

4xy + 2y² = 54
x y² = 23
