Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the opposite sides are parallel, and when you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in certain directions, but still keeping the opposite sides parallel. Since it's equilateral, all sides are of equal length, which is what we're trying to find.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF... Wait, so each of these sides is being extended until they meet to form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. That's interesting because those numbers don't immediately remind me of any standard Pythagorean triple, but maybe they relate in some proportion.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it must be what's called a "parallelogon." Wait, actually, in two dimensions, the only convex parallelogons are parallelograms and regular hexagons. But since it's a hexagon, it's a special case. So, each pair of opposite sides is not only parallel but also translates into each other.

I remember that in such a hexagon, opposite sides are both equal and parallel, so each side is a translation of its opposite. That probably means that the hexagon can be thought of as a combination of three pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by some distance.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, which are alternate sides, they form a triangle. Let me try to imagine this. Each of these sides is a side of the hexagon, and when extended, they intersect to form a larger triangle. So, the triangle is outside the hexagon, and the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle.

Wait, but how exactly are these sides extended? Let me think: AB, CD, and EF are consecutive sides of the hexagon. So, if I extend AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, these extensions will meet at points forming the triangle.

But in a convex hexagon, all internal angles are less than 180 degrees, so the extensions should meet in such a way that the triangle is larger than the hexagon.

I think we might need to use similar triangles here. Because when we extend the sides, the triangle formed is similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides but scaled up. Wait, not exactly, because the hexagon is inside the triangle, but perhaps the sides of the triangle are related proportionally to the hexagon's sides.

Let me think of the hexagon as being formed by cutting off triangles from the corners of a larger triangle. Since all the sides of the hexagon are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the cuts must be made in a symmetric way.

Wait, if I have a big triangle and I cut off three smaller triangles from each corner, each cut is parallel to a side of the triangle. But in this case, the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, so
