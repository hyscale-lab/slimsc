Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and figure out what's going on. 

There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So that's a cyclic quadrilateral or maybe a rectangle since A, D, H, G are on a circle. Wait, rectangles have all angles as right angles, so they are cyclic by nature because opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. Hmm, that might be useful.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. So, rectangle ABCD. Let's label the points: A is the top-left, B is top-right, C is bottom-right, D is bottom-left. Similarly, rectangle EFGH would have E as top-left, F top-right, G bottom-right, H bottom-left. 

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that D, E, C, F are collinear. So if I imagine the two rectangles, their sides DC and EF are lying on the same line. That suggests that the two rectangles share a common side or something? Or maybe they are adjacent in a way that the sides DC and EF lie on the same line.

Wait, but rectangles are 4-sided with right angles. So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, then the line D-E-C-F is a straight line. So, perhaps E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. Or maybe C is between D and E and F. Hmm, the exact order might matter.

Let me see: the order is D, E, C, F are collinear. So starting from D, then E, then C, then F. So the line goes D---E---C---F.

So, the two rectangles are arranged such that their sides DC and EF are along the same straight line, with E and F extending beyond C from D.

Hmm, and points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, since A, D, H, G are on a circle, perhaps ABCD and EFGH are arranged so that their corners touch a circle. 

Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so all its angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle. So, points A, D are from rectangle ABCD, and H, G are from EFGH. So, the four points lie on a circle, which suggests that this circle is passing through two adjacent corners of ABCD and two adjacent corners of EFGH.

Wait, but A is a corner of ABCD, D is another corner, and H and G are corners of EFGH. So, if A, D, H, G lie on a circle, that implies that these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Given that, maybe the two rectangles are positioned such that their sides are aligned in a way that allows this cyclic quadrilateral. Hmm, not sure yet.

Given the lengths: BC = 1
