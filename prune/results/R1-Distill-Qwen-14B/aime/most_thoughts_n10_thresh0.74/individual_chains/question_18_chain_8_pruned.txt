Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all of equal length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, but I'm not sure if that's immediately relevant here.

The problem is about counting rectangles. So, I need to think about what defines a rectangle in a polygon. A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles, so I need to figure out which combinations of these can form right angles.

Wait, in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be categorized based on the number of vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to others by sides or diagonals of different lengths. For example, in a dodecagon, the sides are the edges connecting each vertex to the next, the shortest diagonals connect a vertex to the one two steps away, and so on.

I think the key here is to find all sets of four vertices that form a rectangle. Each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if they are separated by certain steps.

Let me think about the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational and reflectional symmetries. So, any rectangle we find in one part of the dodecagon should be mirrored or rotated to other parts as well.

Now, how do four points form a rectangle? For four points A, B, C, D to form a rectangle, the midpoints of the diagonals AC and BD must coincide. Also, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA must meet at right angles.

But since the dodecagon is regular, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the steps between the vertices. Let me consider the dodecagon inscribed in a unit circle. Each vertex can be labeled with a number from 0 to 11, arranged equally around the circle.

In this case, the positions can be represented as points on the circle at angles of 30 degrees apart (since 360/12 = 30). So, vertex 0 is at 0 degrees, vertex 1 at 30 degrees, vertex 2 at 60 degrees, and so on up to vertex 11 at 330 degrees.

A rectangle would require that the four points lie on a circle, which the dodecagon is, but more importantly, the opposite points must be such that the lines connecting them are diameters. Wait, no, because in a regular polygon, not all rectangles are formed by diameters. Or are they?

Wait, in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a dodecagon, the diameters are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, for example, vertex 0 is opposite to vertex 6, vertex 1 opposite to vertex 7, and so on.

But a rectangle doesn't necessarily have to have its sides as diameters. For example, in a square (which is a regular 4-gon), the sides are not diameters, but the diagonals are.

But in a regular dodecagon, maybe rectangles can be formed in two ways: those that have sides aligned with the diameters, and those that are rotated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: in a regular polygon, a rectangle is formed by two pairs of parallel lines. So, in the dodecagon, each rectangle is determined by choosing two distinct pairs of parallel sides or diagonals.

But how do I count them?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of rectangles based on the steps between the vertices. For a rectangle, the four vertices must be such that each pair of opposite sides is separated by
