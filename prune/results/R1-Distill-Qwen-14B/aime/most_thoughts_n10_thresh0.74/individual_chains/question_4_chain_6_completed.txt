Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 ensure that Bob can always win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how these kinds of games work. It's a combinatorial game, so it probably involves figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So in this case, the game is all about the number of tokens left. The players can take 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The goal is to take the last token, so the player who takes the last token wins.

Let me try to figure out the pattern of winning and losing positions. Maybe I can model this using dynamic programming or recursion. Let's define a function W(n) which is true if the current player can win with n tokens, and false otherwise.

Base cases:
- If n = 0, that means the game is over, so the current player can't win. So W(0) = False.
- If n = 1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So W(1) = True.
- If n = 4, the current player can take 4 tokens and win. So W(4) = True.

Wait, but wait, the player can take 1 or 4 tokens. So for any n, the current player can choose either 1 or 4 tokens to take, unless taking 4 would make n negative, which isn't allowed.

So for a general n, the current player can win if either:
- Taking 1 token leaves the opponent in a losing position (i.e., W(n-1) is False), or
- Taking 4 tokens leaves the opponent in a losing position (i.e., W(n-4) is False).

So the recursive formula is:
W(n) = (not W(n-1)) or (not W(n-4)), assuming n-4 ≥ 0.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The current player can choose either move, so W(n) is True if either of the possible moves leads to the opponent being in a losing position. So more accurately, W(n) is True if either W(n-1) is False or W(n-4) is False. Because if the current player can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position, then the current player can win.

So the correct formula is:
W(n) = (not W(n-1)) or (not W(n-4)), for n ≥ 1, with n-4 ≥ 0 where applicable.

Wait, but when n <4, like n=2 or 3, the player can only take 1 token. So for n=2, W(2) is True only if W(1) is False, right? Because the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, but since W(1) is True, the opponent can take that and win. So wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Let me try to compute W(n) for small n manually and see the pattern.

n=0: W(0)=False (no tokens to take, so you lose).
n=1: Take 1, win. So W(1)=True.
n=2: Take 1, opponent gets n=1, which is a winning position for them. So you can't force a win. So W(2)=False.
n=3: Take 1, opponent gets n=2, which is a losing position for them. So W(3)=True.
n=4: Take 4, win. So W(4)=True.
n=5: If the current player takes 1, opponent gets n=4, which is a win for them. If the current player takes 4, opponent gets n=1, which is a win for them. So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So W(5)=False.
n=6: Take 1, opponent gets n=5, which is a losing position for them. So W(6)=True.
n=7: Take 1, opponent gets n=6 (winning). Take 4, opponent gets n=3 (winning). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So W(7)=False.
n=8: Take 1, opponent gets n=7 (losing). So W(8)=True.
n=9: Take 1, opponent gets n=8 (winning). Take 4, opponent gets n=5 (losing). So since taking 4 leaves opponent in a losing position, W(9)=True.
n=10: Take 1, opponent gets n=9 (winning). Take 4, opponent gets n=6 (winning). So W(10)=False.
n=11: Take 1, opponent gets n=10 (losing). So W(11)=True.
n=12: Take 1, opponent gets n=11 (winning). Take 4, opponent gets n=8 (winning). So W(12)=False.
n=13: Take 1, opponent gets n=12 (losing). So W(13)=True.
n=14: Take 1, opponent gets n=13 (winning). Take 4, opponent gets n=10 (losing). So W(14)=True because taking 4 leaves opponent in losing position.
n=15: Take 1, opponent gets n=14 (winning). Take 4, opponent gets n=11 (winning). So W(15)=False.
n=16: Take 1, opponent gets n=15 (losing). So W(16)=True.
n=17: Take 1, opponent gets n=16 (winning). Take 4, opponent gets n=13 (winning). So W(17)=False.
n=18: Take 1, opponent gets n=17 (losing). So W(18)=True.
n=19: Take 1, opponent gets n=18 (winning). Take 4, opponent gets n=15 (losing). So W(19)=True.
n=20: Take 1, opponent gets n=19 (winning). Take 4, opponent gets n=16 (winning). So W(20)=False.

Wait, starting to see a pattern here. Let me list out the results:

n : W(n)
0 : F
1 : T
2 : F
3 : T
4 : T
5 : F
6 : T
7 : F
8 : T
9 : T
10: F
11: T
12: F
13: T
14: T
15: F
16: T
17: F
18: T
19: T
20: F

Hmm, looking at the pattern:

n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
W: F T F T T F T F T T F T F T T F T F T T F

Looking at this, I notice that every 5 numbers, the pattern repeats maybe? Let's check:

From n=0: F T F T T
n=5: F
n=6: T
n=7: F
n=8: T
n=9: T
So positions 5-9 are F T F T T, same as 0-4. Then n=10 is F, which is same as n=5. Hmm, so from n=5, it's the same as n=0?

Wait, n=5: F, same as n=0: F.

n=6: T, same as n=1: T.

n=7: F, same as n=2: F.

n=8: T, same as n=3: T.

n=9: T, same as n=4: T.

n=10: F, same as n=5: F.

n=11: T, same as n=6: T.

So yes, the pattern repeats every 5 numbers. So the cycle is F, T, F, T, T, F, T, F, T, T, ... etc.

Wait, that is, the sequence for W(n) is periodic with period 5. So for n mod 5, if the remainder is 0,1,2,3,4, then:

If n mod 5 is 0: W(n)=F

n mod 5=1: W(n)=T

n mod5=2: F

n mod5=3: T

n mod5=4: T

Then at n=5, which is 0 mod5, W(5)=F. And n=6 is 1 mod5, W= T, etc.

So the pattern is that for n ≡ 0 mod5, W(n)=F; else, for 1,2,3,4 mod5, W(n) is T except when n mod5=2 or 0, it's F.

Wait, no. Wait, let me list the W(n):

n mod5 | W(n)
0      | F
1      | T
2      | F
3      | T
4      | T

So yes, it's a cycle of 5 where:

- If n ≡ 0 mod5, then W(n)=F.

- If n ≡ 1 mod5, W(n)=T.

- If n ≡ 2 mod5, W(n)=F.

- If n ≡3 mod5, W(n)=T.

- If n ≡4 mod5, W(n)=T.

So for n ≥1, the player can win unless n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, wait, n=2 is a losing position. So when n is 2 mod5, W(n)=F.

So, if n ≡0 or 2 mod5, the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So those are the losing positions.

Therefore, for the game, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, let me confirm with n=10, which is 10 mod5=0, and n=10, which is losing, W(10)=F.

n=7 is 2 mod5, W(7)=F.

n=5 is 0 mod5, W(5)=F.

n=12 is 2 mod5, W(12)=F.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, for the problem, we need to count the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's play. Bob can only guarantee a win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice, which occurs when n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So the problem reduces to finding the number of integers n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

We can compute this by:

Count = floor((2024 -0)/5) + 1 (for 0) + floor((2024 -2)/5) +1 (for 2), but wait, perhaps a better way.

Wait, more accurately, the number of numbers ≤N congruent to a mod5 is given by:

If a=0: floor(N/5) if N is divisible by 5, else floor(N/5).

Wait, no, the formula is:

Number of terms = floor((N - a)/5) + 1, if a ≤ N.

For each residue a (0,2), compute the count.

So for a=0:

Number of n ≤2024 with n ≡0 mod5.

This is floor(2024/5) = 404.8 → 404, but since 5×404=2020, 2020 ≤2024, so 404 +1 (since 0 is included)? Wait, no, n must be positive integers, so n=5,10,...2020.

Wait, wait, n ranges from 1 to 2024. So for a=0, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020. How many terms?

It's (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

Similarly, for a=2: numbers are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum ≤2024.

What is the maximum number ≤2024 that is ≡2 mod5?

It's 2024 mod5: 2024 /5 is 404.8, so 5×404=2020, 2020+2=2022 ≤2024.

So the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

So total numbers where Bob can win is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.

Wait, but let me double-check these calculations.

For a=0:

Numbers are 5,10,...,2020.

Number of terms: 2020 /5=404.

So 404 terms.

For a=2:

Numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.

What is 2022-2=2020, divided by 5 is 404, plus 1 is 405.

So total is 404+405=809.

Therefore, the answer is 809.

But wait, let me confirm whether 2024 is included. The problem says n ≤2024.

Wait, for a=2: 2022 is the last term, which is ≤2024, so that's correct.

So the total number is 404 +405 =809. So the answer is 809.

Wait, but let me confirm with a different approach.

Total numbers from 1 to 2024:2024 numbers.

Numbers where n ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404.8 → 404 numbers.

Numbers where n ≡2 mod5: floor((2024 -2)/5) +1 = floor(2022/5)=404.4 →404, plus 1, so 405.

So 404+405=809.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.


To solve the problem, we identify the losing positions for Alice, which occur when \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \). We then count how many such \( n \) exist up to 2024.

For \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), there are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \) numbers.

For \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), the sequence ends at 2022, giving \( \left\lfloor \frac{2022 - 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \) numbers.

Adding these, the total is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

\boxed{809}
