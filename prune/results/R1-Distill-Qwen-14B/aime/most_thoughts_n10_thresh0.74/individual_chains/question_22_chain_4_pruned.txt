Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. All opposite sides are parallel, which probably means it's a special kind of hexagon, maybe something like a hexagon you can get by extending sides of a triangle or something. The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF, and this triangle has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel. So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel, right? Since it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

They mentioned that if we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. So, these sides must be non-adjacent and when extended, they meet at some points to form a larger triangle. This larger triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. I guess these are the lengths of the extended sides beyond the hexagon.

I remember that in such cases, similar triangles might be involved. Maybe the hexagon is part of a larger triangle, and the hexagon is like a truncated version of it. If I can figure out the ratios of the sides, I can find the side length of the hexagon.

Let me think about the properties. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon should be equilateral and have opposite sides equal and parallel. This makes me think of a regular hexagon, but it's not regular because the triangle formed by extensions has sides of different lengths. So, it's not regular, but it's a special convex equilateral hexagon.

I recall that in such a hexagon, the sides can be thought of as vectors in a plane. Since opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, the sum of these vectors should be zero. Wait, but in an equilateral hexagon, each side has the same length. Hmm.

Maybe it's better to think in terms of affine transformations. An affine transformation can turn a regular hexagon into such a figure, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this using coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and try to find relationships between them. Let's denote the hexagon as ABCDEF, with each consecutive vertex connected. Since it's convex, the points should be ordered in a way that doesn't intersect.

Assuming that AB, CD, and EF are the sides that, when extended, form the triangle. Let's say that when I extend AB beyond A and B, it meets at some point, same with CD and EF. The triangle formed by these extensions has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me denote this triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD, Q is the intersection of CD and EF, and R is the intersection of EF and AB.

Wait, no, that might not be accurate. If AB, CD, EF are extended, then depending on the direction of extension, they may meet at three different points, forming the triangle. But I need to figure out how exactly the hexagon is
