Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's see if I can break it down.

First, I know a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal too. So, each internal angle is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles in a regular polygon is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives 150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. So, I need to think about how rectangles can be formed inside this 12-sided figure. Each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle can't just be any random lines; they have to coincide with the edges or the diagonals of the dodecagon.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a high number of sides like a dodecagon, there are multiple diagonals of different lengths. So, maybe the rectangles are formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides or diagonals.

Wait, in a regular polygon, sides and certain diagonals can be parallel. For example, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, and certain diagonals are also parallel. So, in a dodecagon, which has more sides, there should be more sets of parallel sides and diagonals.

I think the key here is to find pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. Because a rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides.

So, perhaps the approach is to count how many such pairs of parallel lines exist, and then for each such pair of lines, see how many rectangles can be formed by combining them with another pair of parallel lines.

Wait, but rectangles need four sides, so maybe we're looking for two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other. Because in a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals might not all be perpendicular. So maybe the angles between the sides and diagonals can vary, but for forming rectangles, we need two sets of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps not necessarily perpendicular, but that the sides of the rectangle are each aligned with sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, but the angles between the sides of the rectangle could be determined by the angles between the sides of the dodecagon.

Wait, maybe I should think more visually. Let me try to imagine or sketch a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, and each vertex is spaced 30 degrees apart because 360/12 = 30 degrees.

So, each vertex is 30 degrees apart from its adjacent vertices. Now, connecting non-adjacent vertices gives diagonals. The length of the diagonals depends on how many vertices they skip. So, for example, in a dodecagon, a diagonal that skips one vertex is shorter than one that skips two,
