Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how to model this. It sounds like a classic combinatorial game problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the key is to figure out for which values of n Bob can force a win. Since Alice goes first, if n is a winning position, Alice can win. If n is a losing position, Bob can win.

Let me try to find a pattern or recurrence relation for these positions. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). 

Starting with small n:

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice. So Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for Bob. Then Bob can take the last token and win. Wait, no—wait, because the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes 1 and wins. So n=2 would be a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, no, because Alice is going first. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, let me think again. For n=1, Alice takes the last token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for the first player.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for Bob. Bob can then take the last one and win. Alternatively, Alice could take 4 tokens, but that's not possible because there are only 2. So Alice's only move is to take 1. Then Bob can take the last one and win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which means it's a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this by determining for each n whether it's a W or L position.
