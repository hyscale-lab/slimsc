Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the equations given are a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. I need to find all triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both of these conditions.

I remember that when dealing with equations involving symmetric expressions, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric sums or maybe factor the expressions. Let me see if I can manipulate the second equation to make it more manageable.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that this can be factored by grouping terms. Let me try that. 

Group the terms as follows: (a²b + a²c) + (b²a + b²c) + (c²a + c²b). Now, factor each pair:

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, okay, that's a bit simpler. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). That might help.

So, substituting, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can rearrange this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to express this in terms of symmetric sums or perhaps use the identity that relates a³ + b³ + c³ to (a + b + c) and other symmetric sums.

I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Maybe that can help.

Let me write down that identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, plugging that into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [(a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

We know that a + b + c = 300, so let me substitute that in:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [300^3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute 300^3: 300 * 300 * 300 = 27,000,000.

So, substituting:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

300(a² + b² + c²) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Now, let's move the 27,000,000 to the other side:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000.

Which is 33,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit complex, but maybe I can factor out some terms. Let's see: 300, 900, and 3 all have a factor of 3.

Divide the entire equation by 3:

100(a² + b² + c²) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, the equation is:

100(a² + b² + c²) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

I wonder if I can express this in terms of symmetric sums. Let's define S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc.

We also know that a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S1² - 2S2.

So, substituting this into the equation:

100(S1² - 2S2) + 300S2 - S3 = 11,000,000.

We know S1 = 300, so let's compute S1²:

300² = 90,000.

Substituting:

100(90,000 - 2S2) + 300S2 - S3 = 11,000,000.

Multiply through:

100*90,000 = 9,000,000.

100*(-2S2) = -200S2.

So, the equation becomes:

9,000,000 - 200S2 + 300S2 - S3 = 11,000,000.

Combine like terms:

( -200S2 + 300S2 ) = +100S2.

So,

9,000,000 + 100S2 - S3 = 11,000,000.

Subtract 9,000,000 from both sides:

100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now we have:

100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as:

S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000.

So, now, I have an equation relating S2 and S3.

But we also know that S1 = 300, so perhaps we can find S2 in terms of S3 or vice versa.

Wait, but maybe I can use the relationship between S1, S2, and S3. Since I have S1, S2, and S3, perhaps I can find a way to express S2 in terms of S3 or find another equation involving S2 and S3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c. Because for a cubic equation x³ - S1x² + S2x - S3 = 0.

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, maybe we can think about possible integer roots. But that might not be directly helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, perhaps we can fix one variable and express the others in terms of it.

But with three variables, that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the equation S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000 can be used in combination with the symmetric sums.

Wait, let me think about another approach. Since we have a + b + c = 300, and we need to find a, b, c such that 100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

But S2 is ab + bc + ca, and S3 is abc. Maybe I can write S3 in terms of S2.

Wait, but S3 is 100S2 - 2,000,00
