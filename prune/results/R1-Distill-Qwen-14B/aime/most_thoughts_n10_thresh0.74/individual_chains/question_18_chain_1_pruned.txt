Alright, so I need to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay. I'm a bit rusty on dodecagons, but let me think.

First, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, it's also convex, meaning all the vertices point outward, and none of them bend inwards. So, it's a 12-sided polygon with all sides and angles equal.

Now, the problem is about counting the number of rectangles that can be formed inside this dodecagon. Each side of these rectangles has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides or diagonals themselves form the edges of the rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a high number of sides like a dodecagon, there are a lot of diagonals. Each vertex is connected to other non-adjacent vertices by diagonals. The number of sides and diagonals can be calculated, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Thinking about rectangles, they require four sides with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, for a rectangle to be formed inside the dodecagon, the four vertices of the rectangle must be points where the sides or diagonals meet at right angles.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the internal angles are 150 degrees each, right? Because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 is (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. So, the internal angles aren't 90 degrees, but maybe the sides or diagonals can intersect in such a way that right angles are formed.

Wait, but rectangles require 90-degree angles, so maybe the sides of the rectangles are formed by sides or diagonals that intersect at right angles. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and the rectangle's corners lie on the vertices of the dodecagon.

Wait, that might make sense. So, the rectangle's four corners are four vertices
