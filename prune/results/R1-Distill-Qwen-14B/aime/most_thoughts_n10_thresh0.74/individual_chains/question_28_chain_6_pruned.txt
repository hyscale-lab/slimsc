Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. The distance is supposed to be equal for all faces, and the answer needs to be in a specific form.

First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand the given information. The tetrahedron has edges AB and CD both equal to sqrt(41), AC and BD equal to sqrt(80), and BC and AD equal to sqrt(89). So, it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. That's interesting; I think such a tetrahedron is called "isohedral" or maybe "equifacial," but I'm not entirely sure. Regardless, the key is that opposite edges are equal, which might imply some symmetry.

The point I is such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. That point is known as the incenter of the tetrahedron, analogous to the incenter in a triangle. The incenter is the point equidistant from all faces, and that distance is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius r can be calculated using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find both the volume V and the total surface area S.

First, I should figure out the volume V of the tetrahedron. Since it's a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, maybe it's a "kite tetrahedron" or something with some symmetry that can be exploited to calculate the volume more easily. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rectangular box with some edges, but I need to think.

Wait, another approach: If I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system such that the coordinates of the vertices can be determined, then I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product. That might be a good approach because it's a systematic method.

So, let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can place the points in a symmetric way.

Let me consider setting the tetrahedron in 3D space with coordinates such that points A, B, C, D are placed symmetrically.

Let me assign point A to (x, y, z), and then set other points relative to A. But maybe a better approach is to place the tetrahedron such that its centroid is at the origin, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, I can place point A at (a, b, c), point B at (-a, -b, c), point C at (-a, b, -c), and point D at (a, -b, -c). Wait, does that make sense? Let me check the distances.

Wait, that might be overcomplicating. Let me think about the opposite edges being equal. So, AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). Hmm.

If I can find coordinates for the four points such that these edge lengths are satisfied, then it would be easier to compute the volume.

Let me try a strategy where I place the points such that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide. That might help. Let me imagine that the midpoints of AB and CD are the same point, say the origin. Similarly, the midpoints of AC and BD are the same point, and the midpoints of BC and AD are the same point. Wait, but is that possible?

Wait, actually, in such a symmetric case, the tetrahedron would be a parallelepiped or something else? Maybe not exactly, but perhaps it's a special case.

Alternatively, maybe the tetrahedron is formed by two congruent triangles joined in some way. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges is equal, so it's symmetric with respect to swapping certain vertices.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors to represent the points and set up equations based on the given edge lengths.

Let me try that. Let me assign coordinates to the points as follows:

Let me place point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). Then, I can compute the distances between these points and set them equal to the given edge lengths.

So, let's compute AB, AC, AD, etc.

First, AB is the distance between A and B. So, A is (x, y, z), B is (-x, -y, z). The distance AB is sqrt[(x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - z)^2] = sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0] = sqrt(4x² + 4y²) = 2 sqrt(x² + y²). 

Given that AB = sqrt(41), so:

2 sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41) → sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41)/2 → x² + y² = 41/4.

Similarly, let's compute CD. Point C is (-x, y, -z), D is (x, -y, -z). The distance CD is sqrt[( -x -x )² + (y - (-y))² + ( -z - (-z) )²] = sqrt[(-2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0] = sqrt(4x² + 4y²) = same as AB, which is sqrt(41). So that's consistent.

Now, compute AC. Point A is (x, y, z), point C is (-x, y, -z). So, the distance AC is sqrt[(x - (-x))² + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))²] = sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2] = sqrt(4x² + 4z²) = 2 sqrt(x² + z²).

Given AC = sqrt(80), so:

2 sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80) → sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80)/2 = sqrt(20) → x² + z² = 20.

Similarly, compute BD. Point B is (-x, -y, z), point D is (x, -y, -z). The distance BD is sqrt[(-x - x)^2 + (-y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[(-2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2] = same as AC, which is sqrt(80). So that's consistent.

Next, compute BC. Point B is (-x, -y, z), point C is (-x, y, -z). The distance BC is sqrt[(-x - (-x))² + (-y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))²] = sqrt[0 + (-2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = sqrt(4y² + 4z²) = 2 sqrt(y² + z²).

Given BC = sqrt(89), so:

2 sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(89) → sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(89)/2 → y² + z² = 89/4.

So, now I have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41/4

2. x² + z² = 20

3. y² + z² = 89/4

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4

Equation 2: x² + z² = 20

Equation 3: y² + z² = 89/4

I can subtract equation 1 from equation 3: (y² + z²) - (x² + y²) = (89/4) - (41/4) → z² - x² = 48/4 = 12 → z² = x² + 12.

Then, substitute z² into equation 2: x² + (x² +12) = 20 → 2x² +12 =20 → 2x²=8 → x²=4 → x=2 or x=-2.

Since x is a coordinate, it can be positive or negative, but let's take x=2 for simplicity.

So, x=2. Then, from equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4 → 4 + y² = 41/4 → y² = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 → y=5/2 or y=-5/2. Let's take y=5/2.

From equation 2: x² + z² = 20 → 4 + z² =20 → z²=16 → z=4 or z=-4. Let's take z=4.

So, the coordinates are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)

B: (-2, -5/2, 4)

C: (-2, 5/2, -4)

D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Wait, let me verify
