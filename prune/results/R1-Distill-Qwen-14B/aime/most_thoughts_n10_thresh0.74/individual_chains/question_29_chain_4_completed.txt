Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the length of CE. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find CE.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let me visualize the setup. We have two rectangles. Let's recall that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles.

So, rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Wait, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, AB is the length, and BC is the width. So, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is 107 units, BC is 16 units. So, the sides are 107 and 16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. So, EF is longer, 184 units, FG is 17 units. So, EF is the length, FG is the width.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they lie on a straight line. So, I can imagine this line where four points are placed: D, E, C, F from left to right, maybe? Or some other order? I need to think about the positions of the rectangles.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, those four points are concyclic or lie on the same circle. That's important because it might imply something about the shape or the angles between those points.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me assign coordinates to some points to make it clearer.

Let's place rectangle ABCD such that point A is at (0,0). Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC is 16, so point C is at (107,16), and point D is at (0,16). Wait, is that right? Wait, no, because in a rectangle, the sides are connected. So, from A to B is 107 units, then from B to C is 16 units upwards. So, yes, C is at (107,16), and D is at (0,16). So, the rectangle is 107 units long and 16 units tall.

Now, rectangle EFGH. I don't know its position yet. But points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D is at (0,16), and C is at (107,16). So, the line that passes through D and C is the line y=16. So, points E and F must lie on this line as well.

So, E and F are on the line y=16. So, the rectangle EFGH must be positioned such that points E and F lie on y=16. Moreover, since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are connected at right angles.

Given that EF is 184 units, so if E and F are on y=16, then EF is a horizontal line segment of length 184. Similarly, FG is 17 units, so from F, moving upwards or downwards 17 units to point G.

Wait, but in which direction? Since E and F are on y=16, and FG is 17 units, but since EFGH is a rectangle, FG must be vertical, right? Because EF is horizontal. So, from F, moving vertically (either up or down) 17 units to reach G. Similarly, from E, moving vertically 17 units to reach H.

But wait, the rectangle can also be placed in the opposite direction, but given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle, I think the direction is important.

Wait, points A, D, H, G are concyclic. So, A is at (0,0), D is at (0,16), H is a corner of rectangle EFGH, and G is another corner.

Let me think: in rectangle EFGH, points E, F, G, H are the corners. So, E and F are on y=16. Let me assign coordinates to E and F. Let me say E is at (x,16), and F is at (x+184,16), since EF is 184 units. Then, from F, moving vertically 17 units to reach G. But wait, which direction? Up or down?

If I assume it's moving upwards, then G would be at (x+184, 16+17) = (x+184, 33). Similarly, H would be at (x,16+17) = (x,33). But then, points A(0,0), D(0,16), G(x,33), H(x,33) lie on a circle. Wait, but H and G are both at (x,33) and (x+184,33), so no, that can't be, because H would be at (x,33), and G at (x+184,33). Wait, no, in a rectangle, moving from E to H is vertical, so from E(x,16), moving vertically to H(x,16+17) = (x,33). Similarly, from F(x+184,16), moving vertically to G(x+184,33).

Wait, but then A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33), G(x+184,33) lie on a circle. So, four points: A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

Alternatively, if the rectangle is drawn downward, then G would be at (x+184,16-17) = (x+184, -1), and H at (x, -1). But then, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x, -1), G(x+184, -1) lie on a circle. Hmm, that might complicate things, but perhaps the circle can be determined either way.

But let's see: if we take the rectangle EFGH above the line y=16, then points H and G are at (x,33) and (x+184,33). The line y=33 is 17 units above y=16.

Alternatively, if it's drawn below, they are at y=-1, which is 17 units below y=16.

But let's proceed with the assumption that it's drawn above, as that might make the circle pass through A and D more naturally. Let's test that assumption.

So, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33), G(x+184,33).

These four points lie on a circle. Let me recall that four points lie on a circle if their coordinates satisfy the general equation of a circle. The general equation is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. Alternatively, using determinants or other methods.

But perhaps a better approach is to find the condition that these four points lie on a circle.

Alternatively, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, the opposite angles should sum to 180 degrees. But since we have coordinates, it's perhaps easier to use the cyclic condition.

Another approach is to use the power of a point or something else.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, G.

Let me denote the coordinates of H as (h,33) and G as (h+184,33). Because EF is 184, so E is at (h,16), F is at (h+184,16), then H is at (h,33), G is at (h+184,33).

So, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(h,33), G(h+184,33) lie on a circle.

Let me write the general equation of a circle passing through these four points.

The general equation is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Plugging in each point:

1. For A(0,0):
0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0.

So, the equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

2. For D(0,16):
0 + (16)^2 + 0 + 2f(16) = 0
256 + 32f = 0 => 32f = -256 => f = -8.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx - 16y = 0.

3. For H(h,33):
h² + (33)^2 + 2g(h) -16(33) = 0
h² + 1089 + 2gh - 528 = 0
h² + 2gh + 561 = 0.

4. For G(h+184,33):
(h+184)^2 + 33^2 + 2g(h+184) -16*33 = 0.

Let's compute this:

(h+184)^2 = h² + 368h + (184)^2 = h² + 368h + 33856.

33^2 = 1089.

2g(h+184) = 2gh + 368g.

-16*33 = -528.

So, putting it all together:

h² + 368h + 33856 + 1089 + 2gh + 368g - 528 = 0.

Simplify:

h² + 368h + 33856 + 1089 = h² + 368h + 34945.

Then, -528: 34945 - 528 = 34417.

So, equation becomes:

h² + 368h + 34417 + 2gh + 368g = 0.

But from equation 3, we have h² + 2gh + 561 = 0.

So, let me subtract equation 3 from equation 4 to eliminate h² and 2gh.

Equation 4: h² + 368h + 34417 + 2gh + 368g = 0.

Equation 3: h² + 2gh + 561 = 0.

Subtract equation 3 from equation 4:

(h² + 368h + 34417 + 2gh + 368g) - (h² + 2gh + 561) = 0 -0.

Simplify:

(0) + 368h + 34417 + 368g -561 = 0.

Compute constants: 34417 - 561 = 33856.

So, 368h + 33856 + 368g = 0.

Factor out 368: 368(h + g) + 33856 = 0.

Divide both sides by 368:

(h + g) + (33856 / 368) = 0.

Compute 33856 / 368.

Let me compute 33856 ÷ 368.

368 x 92 = 368 x 90 = 33120, plus 368 x2=736, total 33120+736=33856. So, 368 x92 =33856.

So, 33856 / 368 =92.

Therefore:

h + g +92 =0.

So, h + g = -92.

So, equation 5: h + g = -92.

Now, from equation 3: h² + 2gh + 561 =0.

We can write this as h² + 2gh + 561 =0.

This is a quadratic in h. Let me express g from equation 5: g = -92 -h.

Substitute into equation 3:

h² + 2*(-92 -h)*h +561 =0.

Compute:

h² - 2h(92 + h) +561 =0.

Which is h² -184h -2h² +561 =0.

Simplify:

(-h²) -184h +561=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

h² + 184h -561=0.

So, quadratic equation: h² + 184h -561=0.

Let me solve for h using quadratic formula.

h = [-184 ± sqrt(184² + 4*561)] /2.

Compute discriminant:

184² = (180 +4)^2 = 180² + 2*180*4 +4²=32400 + 1440 +16=33856.

4*561=2244.

So, discriminant = 33856 +2244=36100.

sqrt(36100)=190.

So, h = [ -184 ±190 ] /2.

So, two solutions:

h = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3.

h = (-184 -190)/2= (-374)/2= -187.

So, h can be 3 or -187.

So, h=3 or h=-187.

Now, let's think about what h represents. h is the x-coordinate of point E, which is on the line y=16, between D(0,16) and C(107,16). Since E and F are points on DC line, and E, F are part of rectangle EFGH, which is another rectangle.

Wait, but D is at (0,16), E is at (h,16), and C is at (107,16). So, E is somewhere on the line DC, which is from (0,16) to (107,16). So, h must be between 0 and 107, or could it be beyond? Let me think.

Wait, if E is between D and C, then h would be between 0 and 107. But if E is beyond C, then h>107. Similarly, if E is before D, h<0.

But in our solutions, h=3 and h=-187. So, h=3 is between 0 and 107, so that's acceptable. h=-187 is way before D(0,16), so E would be at (-187,16), which is far to the left of D.

But then, rectangle EFGH would extend from E(-187,16) to F(-187+184,16)= (-3,16). Then, G would be at (-187, 33) and H at (-3,33). Wait, but then points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(-3,33), G(-187,33) lie on a circle.

Hmm, that's possible, but seems a bit far. Alternatively, h=3 would place E at (3,16), F at (3+184=187,16), G at (187,33), H at (3,33).

Wait, but point F is at (187,16), which is beyond point C, which is at (107,16). So, C is at (107,16), F is at (187,16). So, the order of points on the line y=16 would be D(0,16), E(3,16), C(107,16), F(187,16). So, that makes sense.

Alternatively, if h=-187, then E is at (-187,16), F is at (-187+184,16)= (-3,16). So, the order would be E(-187,16), D(0,16), C(107,16), F(-3,16). Wait, but F would be at (-3,16), which is to the left of D. So, the order would be E(-187,16), F(-3,16), D(0,16), C(107,16). So, that's also a possibility.

But let's see if both solutions are valid.

Wait, but when h=3, F is at (187,16), which is far to the right of C(107,16). So, E is just after D, and F is way beyond C.

In this case, since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides would be EF=184, FG=17, GH=184, HE=17. So, that's fine.

But we need to find CE. Point C is at (107,16). Point E is at (3,16) or (-187,16). So, CE would be |107 -3|=104 or |107 - (-187)|=294.

But the problem says "the length of CE", so probably the shorter one, which is 104. But let's check both.

Wait, let me think. If E is at (3,16), then CE is 107-3=104. If E is at (-187,16), then CE is 107 - (-187)=294.

But I need to see if both solutions are possible.

Wait, when h=3, E is at (3,16), F is at (187,16). Then, H is at (3,33), G is at (187,33).

Then, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(3,33), G(187,33) lie on a circle. Let's check if that's possible.

Alternatively, if h=-187, E is at (-187,16), F is at (-3,16). Then, H is at (-187,33), G is at (-3,33). Points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(-187,33), G(-3,33) lie on a circle.

Either case is possible. But perhaps we can find which one is correct based on the configuration.

Wait, since E and F are points such that D,E,C,F are collinear, so E is between D and F, but if E is before D, then F would be beyond E. So, in the first case, E is between D and C, making F beyond C. In the second case, E is before D, and F is between E and D.

But let's think about the rectangles.

In the first case, with E at (3,16), F at (187,16). So, rectangle EFGH is to the right of E. So, from E(3,16), moving to F(187,16), then up to G(187,33), then left to H(3,33), then down to E again.

In this case, the rectangle is placed such that E is near D, and F is way beyond C.

In the second case, E is at (-187,16), F at (-3,16). So, the rectangle is placed left of D, with E at (-187,16), F at (-3,16). Then, moving up to G(-3,33) and H(-187,33).

In this case, points G and H are far to the left of the other rectangle ABCD.

But in both cases, the four points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

But which one is correct? The problem states that D,E,C,F are collinear, but doesn't specify the order. So, E could be between D and F, or F between E and D.

Wait, but in the first case, E is between D and C, so F is beyond C. In the second case, E is before D, so F is between E and D.

But the problem says "D,E,C,F are collinear", meaning D, E, C, F lie on a straight line in that order? Or could it be another order?

Wait, it just says they are collinear, without specifying the order. So, possible orders are:

D, E, C, F

D, F, E, C

E, D, C, F

E, C, D, F

and so on. So, multiple orders are possible.

But in our solutions, when h=3, the order is D, E, C, F.

When h=-187, the order is E, F, D, C.

So, both are possible.

But the problem doesn't specify the order, so both solutions might be acceptable. But since we need to find CE, which is the distance between C(107,16) and E.

In the first case, E is at (3,16), so CE is 104.

In the second case, E is at (-187,16), so CE is 294.

But the problem asks for the length of CE. So, unless there's a way to determine which one is correct, perhaps both are possible, but we need to see if both satisfy the circle condition.

Wait, perhaps the circle condition is satisfied in both cases.

Wait, but in the first case, with h=3, the circle passes through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(3,33), G(187,33).

In the second case, the circle passes through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(-187,33), G(-3,33).

So, both circles exist.

But the problem is asking for CE, so perhaps both are possible. But since it's a math problem, usually, there's a unique answer. So, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, let me think again about the initial problem statement.

It says that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, all four points lie on a straight line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F in that order? Or any order?

In our first case, with h=3, the order is D, E, C, F on the line y=16.

In the second case, with h=-187, the order is E, F, D, C on the line y=16.

So, both are possible.

But perhaps in the problem, the rectangles are drawn in such a way that EFGH is on one side of ABCD. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps both solutions are possible. But since we get two possible CE lengths, perhaps only one of them is valid based on the circle condition.

Wait, but in both cases, the four points lie on a circle. So, perhaps both are valid.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the length of CE. So, maybe both 104 and 294 are possible. But since the problem is presented as a single answer, perhaps I need to check which one is correct.

Wait, let me think about the coordinates of the circle.

In the first case, with h=3, the circle passes through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(3,33), G(187,33). Let me compute the radius and center to see if that makes sense.

The general equation is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy =0.

We found earlier that f=-8, so equation is x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

From point H(3,33): 9 + 1089 + 6g - 528 =0.

9 + 1089 =1098; 1098 -528=570. So, 570 +6g=0 => 6g= -570 => g= -95.

So, equation is x² + y² -190x -16y=0.

Wait, 2g= -190, so g=-95.

Center of the circle is at (-g, -f) = (95,8). Radius is sqrt(95² +8² -0)=sqrt(9025 +64)=sqrt(9089)= approximately 95.34.

So, the circle is centered at (95,8), radius ~95.34.

Does point G(187,33) lie on this circle?

Let's check:

(187)^2 + (33)^2 -190*(187) -16*(33)=?

Compute:

187²=34969.

33²=1089.

190*187=35530.

16*33=528.

So, 34969 +1089 -35530 -528.

Compute 34969+1089=36058.

35530+528=36058.

So, 36058 -36058=0.

Yes, it does lie on the circle.

Similarly, point H(3,33):

3² +33² -190*3 -16*33=9 +1089 -570 -528.

9+1089=1098.

570+528=1098.

1098-1098=0.

So, yes, it lies on the circle.

Similarly, point A(0,0):

0 +0 -0 -0=0.

Point D(0,16):

0 +256 -0 -256=0.

So, all points lie on the circle. So, that's correct.

Now, let's check the other case, h=-187.

So, h=-187, g= -92 -h= -92 -(-187)=95.

So, g=95.

So, the equation is x² + y² + 2*95x -16y=0.

Which is x² + y² +190x -16y=0.

Now, check point H(-187,33):

(-187)^2 +33^2 +190*(-187) -16*33.

Compute:

(-187)^2=34969.

33^2=1089.

190*(-187)= -35530.

16*33=528.

So, 34969 +1089=36058.

-35530 -528= -36058.

So, 36058 -36058=0.

Yes, lies on the circle.

Point G(-3,33):

(-3)^2 +33^2 +190*(-3) -16*33.

9 +1089=1098.

190*(-3)=-570.

16*33=528.

So, 1098 -570 -528=1098 -1098=0.

Point A(0,0):

0 +0 +0 -0=0.

Point D(0,16):

0 +256 +0 -256=0.

So, all points lie on the circle. So, both solutions are valid.

Hence, CE can be either 104 or 294.

But the problem is presented as a single answer. So, perhaps I need to determine which one is the correct configuration.

Wait, let me see: in the first case, E is between D and C, so CE=104. In the second case, E is before D, so CE=294.

But let me think about the rectangles.

In the first case, E is between D and C, so the rectangle EFGH is extending beyond C. So, the two rectangles are adjacent, with EFGH attached to ABCD at D and C.

In the second case, E is far to the left of D, so EFGH is a separate rectangle not overlapping with ABCD except at D and C.

But the problem says "rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear." It doesn't specify the order. So, both configurations are possible.

But the problem is asking for CE, which is the distance between C and E.

But since both are possible, but in the problem statement, perhaps the order is D-E-C-F, so E is between D and C, making CE=104.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the smaller length, which is 104.

But wait, to be thorough, let me check if in the second case, the rectangle EFGH is such that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

We saw that, yes, they do. So, both possibilities are acceptable.

But perhaps the problem expects the minimal CE, which is 104. Alternatively, the problem might implicitly assume that E is between D and C.

But, since the problem statement is neutral on the order, perhaps both are acceptable, but since the problem asks for the length of CE, without any additional constraints, perhaps both are possible.

But the problem is expecting a single answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the rectangle EFGH is above the line y=16.

Wait, what if the rectangle is drawn below the line y=16? Let me check.

Earlier, I assumed that FG is upwards, but it could also be downwards.

So, if E is at (h,16), and FG is 17 units downward, then G would be at (h+184,16-17)=(h+184, -1), and H would be at (h, -1).

So, the rectangle EFGH would be below the line y=16.

Then, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(h,-1), G(h+184,-1) lie on a circle.

Let me try this case.

So, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(h,-1), G(h+184,-1).

Let me write the general equation of the circle.

Again, general equation: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy +c=0.

Plugging in A(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 => c=0.

So, equation: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy=0.

Plugging in D(0,16):

0 + 256 +0 + 32f=0 =>32f= -256 =>f= -8.

So, equation: x² + y² + 2gx -16y=0.

Now, plugging in H(h,-1):

h² + 1 + 2gh -16*(-1)=0 => h² + 2gh +17=0.

Plugging in G(h+184,-1):

(h+184)^2 + 1 +2g(h+184) -16*(-1)=0.

Expand:

h² + 368h + 184² +1 + 2gh + 368g +16=0.

Simplify:

h² +368h +33856 +1 +2gh +368g +16=0.

Total constants: 33856 +1 +16=33873.

So, equation becomes:

h² +368h +2gh +33873 +368g=0.

From H's equation: h² +2gh +17=0.

Subtract H's equation from G's equation:

(h² +368h +2gh +33873 +368g) - (h² +2gh +17) =0 -0.

Simplify:

0 +368h +33873 +368g -17=0.

Compute constants: 33873-17=33856.

So, 368h +33856 +368g=0.

Factor out 368:

368(h +g) +33856=0.

Divide by 368:

h +g +92=0.

So, equation 5: h +g= -92.

From H's equation: h² +2gh +17=0.

Express g= -92 -h.

Substitute into H's equation:

h² +2*(-92 -h)*h +17=0.

Which is h² -2h(92 +h) +17=0.

Expanding:

h² -184h -2h² +17=0.

Simplify:

- h² -184h +17=0.

Multiply by -1:

h² +184h -17=0.

This is a quadratic equation: h² +184h -17=0.

Solutions:

h = [-184 ± sqrt(184² +4*17)] /2.

Compute discriminant:

184²=33856.

4*17=68.

Total discriminant:33856+68=33924.

sqrt(33924)=184.19? Wait, let me compute sqrt(33924).

184²=33856. 185²=34225. So, 184²=33856, 33856+68=33924, so sqrt(33924)=184.19? Wait, 184*184=33856, so 33924-33856=68, so sqrt(33924)=184 + 68/(2*184) approximately, but exact value is sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481). Hmm, 8481 is 8481. Let me see: 92²=8464, 93²=8649. So, 8481 is between 92² and 93². So, 92²=8464, so 8481-8464=17. So, 92² +17=8481. So, sqrt(8481)=92 +17/(2*92) approximately, but it's not a whole number.

So, h is not an integer in this case. Hmm, but the problem's given lengths are all integers, so perhaps this case is not possible. So, maybe the rectangle EFGH is above the line y=16, not below.

So, perhaps the earlier solutions are the correct ones, with h=3 and h=-187.

But then, the problem expects a single integer answer, so perhaps 104 is the answer, assuming E is between D and C.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the direction of the rectangle.

Wait, another thought: in the first case, E is at (3,16), F is at (187,16). Then, the rectangle EFGH is to the right of ABCD.

But in that case, CE would be 107 -3=104.

In the second case, E is at (-187,16), F is at (-3,16). So, the rectangle is to the left of ABCD.

But the problem says "D,E,C,F are collinear". So, perhaps E is between D and C, making F beyond C. Thus, CE would be 104.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is set up such that EFGH is drawn on the same side as ABCD, so E is between D and C.

Given that, probably the answer is 104.

But to be thorough, let me see if there's another way.

Wait, perhaps using similar triangles or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, and A(0,0), D(0,16), H(h,33), G(h+184,33), perhaps the power of point C with respect to the circle can be used.

Wait, point C is at (107,16). Let me compute the power of point C with respect to the circle passing through A, D, H, G.

The power of C is equal to CA * CD (if A and D are on the circle). Wait, no, the power of a point with respect to a circle is defined as the product of the distances from the point to the intersection points of any line through the point and the circle.

But in this case, point C is outside the circle (since the circle passes through A, D, H, G). Let me compute the power of point C.

The power of C is CO² - r², where O is the center of the circle, r is the radius.

From earlier, in the first case, the circle has center at (95,8), radius sqrt(9089).

Compute CO²: (107 -95)^2 + (16 -8)^2= (12)^2 + (8)^2=144 +64=208.

r²=9089.

So, power=208 -9089= -8881.

But the power of point C is also equal to CE * CF, since line C-E-F intersects the circle at E and F.

Wait, no. Wait, line C-E-F passes through C, E, D, F. Wait, in this case, E and F are on the line y=16, which is the line where C lies.

Wait, but points A, D, H, G are on the circle, but E and F are on the line y=16.

So, the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CE * CF.

Wait, because line CF passes through E and F, which are on the line y=16.

Wait, no, actually, E and F are on the line y=16, but the circle passes through A, D, H, G.

But the line y=16 is not a tangent or a secant to the circle. Wait, A and D are on the circle, on line y=16.

Wait, A is at (0,0), D at (0,16). So, line AD is vertical, from (0,0) to (0,16). So, line y=16 is passing through D and point F, E, C.

But the circle intersects line y=16 at points A and D.

Wait, no, point A is at (0,0), which is not on y=16. So, the circle intersects line y=16 only at point D(0,16) and another point. Wait, point E is on line y=16 but is E on the circle?

No, because E is part of rectangle EFGH, but in our previous analysis, E is at (3,16), which is not on the circle. Because when we plugged in E(3,16) into the circle equation, it didn't satisfy.

Wait, let me check.

In the first case, with h=3, the circle equation is x² + y² -190x -16y=0.

Plugging in E(3,16): 9 + 256 -570 -256=9 +256=265; 570+256=826. 265 -826= -561≠0.

So, E is not on the circle.

So, line y=16 intersects the circle at D(0,16) and another point.

Wait, the circle equation is x² + y² -190x -16y=0.

Let me find the intersection points with y=16.

Substitute y=16:

x² + 256 -190x -256=0 =>x² -190x=0 =>x(x -190)=0.

So, x=0 or x=190.

So, points of intersection are (0,16) and (190,16).

So, the line y=16 intersects the circle at D(0,16) and another point (190,16).

So, point E is at (3,16), which is not on the circle, and point F is at (187,16), which is not on the circle.

Wait, but in this case, point F is at (187,16). The circle intersects y=16 at (0,16) and (190,16). So, 187 is close to 190, but not exactly on.

So, in this case, line CF passes through C(107,16) and F(187,16). So, does this line pass through the circle? Yes, at (190,16), but F is at (187,16). So, the line passes through F and C.

The power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CF * CE, where CF is the distance from C to F, and CE is the distance from C to E.

Wait, no. Wait, the power of point C is equal to the product of the lengths from C to the two intersection points of any line through C with the circle.

In this case, line CF intersects the circle at F and another point. But wait, point F is not on the circle. Wait, the line y=16 intersects the circle at D and (190,16). So, line y=16 passes through D, E, C, F.

So, power of point C with respect to the circle is CD * CC', where C' is the other intersection point. But point C is at (107,16), and the other intersection is at (190,16). So, CD is the distance from C to D, which is |107 -0|=107. CC' is the distance from C to C', which is |190 -107|=83.

So, power of C is CD * CC' =107 *83=8881.

Alternatively, the power can be calculated as CO² - r².

Earlier, we found CO²=208, r²=9089. So, power=208 -9089= -8881.

Wait, but CD * CC' =107 *83=8881, which is the negative of the power. Wait, no, perhaps I have the sign wrong.

Wait, the power of a point outside the circle is equal to the product of the distances from the point to the intersection points, and it's positive. If the point is inside, it's negative.

Here, point C is on the line y=16, which intersects the circle at D(0,16) and (190,16). Since C is at (107,16), which is between 0 and 190, so it's inside the circle? Wait, no, because the circle's radius is about 95.34, and center at (95,8). So, point C is at (107,16), which is outside the circle.

Wait, let me compute CO²: (107-95)^2 + (16 -8)^2=12² +8²=144+64=208.

r²=9089.

So, power=208 -9089= -8881.

But since C is outside the circle, the power should be positive. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the power is defined as CO² - r². If the point is outside, then CO² > r², so power is positive. If inside, negative.

But in this case, CO²=208, r²=9089, so 208 <9089, so power is negative, meaning C is inside the circle. But point C is at (107,16), center at (95,8). The distance from C to center is sqrt( (12)^2 + (8)^2 )=sqrt(144+64)=sqrt(208)=~14.42, which is less than the radius sqrt(9089)=~95.34. So, yes, C is inside the circle.

Wait, but line y=16 passes through C and intersects the circle at D(0,16) and (190,16). So, since C is inside the circle, the power of point C is equal to CD * CC', but since C is inside, the product is negative.

Wait, correct formula: If a line through C intersects the circle at X and Y, then CX * CY = power of C.

In this case, line y=16 passes through C and intersects the circle at D and (190,16). So, the distances are CD and CC'.

But since C is between D and (190,16), then the product is negative: CD * CC' = - |CD| * |CC'|.

But the power is CO² - r²=208 -9089= -8881.

Thus, CD * CC' = -8881.

But CD is the distance from C to D, which is 107 units (from (107,16) to (0,16)).

CC' is the distance from C to (190,16), which is 190 -107=83 units.

So, CD * CC' =107 * (-83)= -8881, which matches the power.

So, in this case, the product is negative because C is inside the circle.

But how does this relate to CE and CF?

Wait, points E and F are on line y=16. So, perhaps line EC is passing through E and C, but E is another point on y=16.

Wait, but E is at (3,16), F at (187,16).

Wait, but the line y=16 passes through E, C, F, D.

Wait, in the power of a point, we consider lines through C intersecting the circle. So, if we take line EC, which is part of y=16, which intersects the circle at D and (190,16). So, E and F are on the same line, but E is not on the circle.

Wait, perhaps the power of C with respect to the circle is equal to CE * CF.

Wait, because line CF passes through C, E, F, but E is not on the circle.

Wait, no, line CF is the same as line y=16, which intersects the circle at D and (190,16). So, CE and CF are parts of this line.

But the power of point C is equal to CD * CC' =107 *83=8881. But since C is inside the circle, it's negative, -8881.

But CE is 107 -3=104, CF is 187 -107=80.

Wait, 104 *80=8320, which is not equal to 8881.

Wait, but that's the product of CE and CF, which is 104 *80=8320.

But the power is -8881.

Hmm, so 8320 ≠8881. So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the power is equal to CE * CF', where F' is another intersection point.

Wait, no, F is on the line y=16, but not on the circle.

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the property that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, and use coordinates to find h, which we've already done.

Earlier, we found h=3 and h=-187, leading to CE=104 or 294.

But since the problem expects a single answer, probably 104, as the other is too large.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a unique solution, so maybe I made a mistake in the earlier assumption.

Wait, wait, in the case where h=3, the rectangle EFGH is to the right of ABCD, and point E is at (3,16), which is between D(0,16) and C(107,16). So, the order is D-E-C-F.

In this case, CE=107-3=104.

In the other case, E is at (-187,16), which is far to the left of D(0,16), making F at (-3,16), between E and D.

So, the order is E-F-D-C.

In that case, CE= distance from C(107,16) to E(-187,16)=107 - (-187)=294.

But perhaps the problem expects the minimal CE, which is 104.

Alternatively, the problem might assume that E is between D and C, making F beyond C.

But I think the answer is 104.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions and use coordinate geometry and circle properties.

1. **Assigning Coordinates:**
   - Rectangle $ABCD$ has $AB = 107$ and $BC = 16$. Assign $A(0,0)$, $B(107,0)$, $C(107,16)$, and $D(0,16)$.
   - Rectangle $EFGH$ has $EF = 184$ and $FG = 17$. Points $D$, $E$, $C$, $F$ are collinear on the line $y=16$.

2. **Positioning Rectangles:**
   - Points $E$ and $F$ lie on $y=16$. Let $E(h,16)$ and $F(h+184,16)$. The rectangle $EFGH$ extends vertically from $EF$ by $17$ units, giving $H(h,33)$ and $G(h+184,33)$.

3. **Circle Condition:**
   - Points $A(0,0)$, $D(0,16)$, $H(h,33)$, and $G(h+184,33)$ lie on a circle. Using the general circle equation and substituting these points, we derive the conditions for $h$.

4. **Solving for $h$:**
   - The circle equation leads to a quadratic in $h$: $h^2 + 184h - 561 = 0$. Solving, we find $h = 3$ or $h = -187$.

5. **Determining $CE$:**
   - If $h = 3$, $E$ is at $(3,16)$, and $CE = 107 - 3 = 104$.
   - If $h = -187$, $E$ is at $(-187,16)$, and $CE = 107 - (-187) = 294$.

6. **Selecting the Valid Solution:**
   - The problem likely assumes the minimal length, where $E$ is between $D$ and $C$, making $CE = 104$.

**Answer:** $\boxed{104}$
