Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.

First, since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, that means z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. I can represent z in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I could write z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Maybe using the exponential form might be easier when dealing with powers and reciprocals.

Wait, the expression involves both z and 1/z. Let's see: since |z| = 4, then |1/z| = 1/4. So 1/z can be written as (1/4)e^{-iθ} because if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting z and 1/z into the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z
= (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{iθ}))
= (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)( (1/4) e^{-iθ} )

Let me compute each term separately. First, (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) can be written as 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}. Similarly, the second term is (1/4)*(96 + 144i)*e^{-iθ}.

Let me factor out the constants:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}
Second term: (1/4)*(96 + 144i)*e^{-iθ}

Let me compute these coefficients:

Compute 4*(75 + 117i):
4*75 = 300
4*117 = 468
So first term coefficient is 300 + 468i.

Compute (1/4)*(96 + 144i):
96/4 = 24
144/4 = 36
So second term coefficient is 24 + 36i.

So now, the expression becomes:

(300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}

Hmm, I can write e^{iθ} as cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} as cosθ - i sinθ. So let me substitute that:

First term:
(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468 i^2 sinθ
Remember that i^2 = -1, so:
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Combine like terms:
Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i

Second term:
(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ -24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ -36 i^2 sinθ
Again, i^2 = -1, so:
= 24 cosθ -24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Combine like terms:
Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i

Now, adding both terms together:

Real parts:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i
= [300 sinθ -24 sinθ + 468 cosθ +36 cosθ] i
= [276 sinθ + 504 cosθ] i

So the entire expression becomes:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)

But we are interested in the real part of this expression. So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part as θ varies. So we need to find the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I remember that an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and φ is some angle. The maximum value is then C.

Wait, but in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me write it as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ. So, A = 324 and B = -432.

So the amplitude C = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Let's compute that.

First, compute 324^2:
324 * 324: Let's see, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross terms 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 976? Wait, wait, wait, 324 is 18^2, which is 324. So 324^2 is (18^2)^2 = 18^4 = 104,976. Wait
