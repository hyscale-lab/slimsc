Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find OC² where C is a specific point on segment AB. Hmm. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. Then, there's this family of segments F, each of length 1, lying in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, these are like line segments from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, with PQ being of unit length.

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from this family F except for AB itself. Then, we need to find OC² and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Alright, so first, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is a line segment connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all unit-length segments PQ where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, so each PQ is a hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs on the axes.

I think the first step is to write the equation for segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, because when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, let's double-check that. The equation of a line given two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is y - y1 = m(x - x1). Taking point A: (1/2, 0), so y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). Yep, that's correct.

So, any point C on AB can be represented as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, and 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2.

Now, the family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each such PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers such that sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p² + q² = 1.

For each such segment PQ, we can write its equation. The line PQ would have intercepts at (p, 0) and (0, q). So, its equation is x/p + y/q = 1.

Now, any point on AB, except A and B, that lies on more than one such PQ would be a point where AB intersects two different PQ segments. But the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB.

Wait, actually, AB itself is a segment from A to B, which is also in F, because OA is 1/2 and OB is sqrt(3)/2. Let me check: OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2, so OA² + OB² = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1, so AB is indeed of length 1, since the distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is a member of F.

So, the point C is on AB, but it's not on any other PQ from F except AB. So, we need to find C such that it's the only point on AB that isn't intersected by any other PQ from F.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F? I'm not entirely sure, but maybe I can think about the envelope of all these PQ lines.

The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if I can find the envelope of all the lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1, then the point C would be where AB is tangent to this envelope.

So, let's try to find the envelope of the family F.

The standard way to find the envelope of a family of curves is to solve the system consisting of the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.

In this case, the family is given by F(p, q) = x/p + y/q - 1 = 0, with the condition that p² + q² = 1.

But perhaps it's better to use a single parameter. Let me express q in terms of p: q = sqrt(1 - p²). But since p and q are positive (since we're in the first quadrant), we can write q = sqrt(1 - p²).

So, the equation becomes x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

Let me denote this as F(p) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) - 1 = 0.

To find the envelope, we need to solve for p where F(p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

So, compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = -x/p² + (y * ( (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-1/2)(2p) )) / ( (1 - p²) )

Wait, let me compute that derivative correctly.

Actually, F(p) = x/p + y*(1 - p²)^(-1/2) - 1
