Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win in this game. The game is between Alice and Bob, starting with Alice. Each player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The person who takes the last token wins.

Hmm, I remember that in such games, it's often useful to look for a pattern or a cycle in the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, if Bob is to have a winning strategy, Alice must be faced with a losing position on her first turn. That means the initial number of tokens n must be a losing position for Alice, which would make Bob the winner.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The last token is taken by the player, so that's an immediate win. So, position 1: if there's 1 token, the player takes it and wins, so that's a winning position.

Similarly, position 4: the player can take 4 tokens and win. So 4 is a winning position.

But wait, what about other numbers? Let's try to list out the positions from 0 upwards.

Wait, position 0 is when there are no tokens left. The player who just moved took the last token, so the next player can't move and thus loses. So position 0 is a losing position because the player whose turn it is can't make a move.

Wait, but in the game, players can take 1 or 4 tokens. So, starting from n=0: losing position.

n=1: can take 1, leaving 0 for the opponent who loses. So W.

n=2: can take 1, leaving 1 for opponent, which is a W position for them. Or take 4, which isn't possible. So if you take 1, opponent is left with n=1 (W), so you can force them into a W position. Wait, but if the opponent is in a W position, that means they can win, so that's bad for me. So if I take 1 from n=2, opponent can take the last token and win. So n=2: can you win? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of Grundy numbers or something. Alternatively, to build a table of whether each n is a winning or losing position.

Let's try building a table step by step:

n | Is Winning (W) or Losing (L) | Reason
--- | --- | ---
0 | L | No moves possible
1 | W | Can take 1, opponent loses
2 | ? | Let's see. From n=2, possible moves are to n=1 or n=-2 (which isn't possible). So only move to n=1. Is n=1 a W or L? It's W. So if I move to n=1, opponent can win. So n=2 must be L? Because all possible moves lead to opponent being able to win. Wait, no. Wait, n=2: possible moves are to 1 or -2, but -2 is invalid. So only move to 1. Since 1 is a W position, that means that from n=2, any move leads to a W position for the opponent, meaning n=2 is L.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: If all possible moves from n lead to W positions for the opponent, then n is a losing position. If any move leads to an L position for the opponent, then n is W.

Wait, that's correct. So for n=2, the only possible move is to 1, which is W. So the opponent can win from 1, so n=2 is L.

n=3: possible moves are to 2 or -1. Only move is to 2, which is L. So if n=3, you can move to L for the opponent, so n=3 is W.

n=4: can take 1 or 4. Taking 1 leaves 3 (W), taking 4 leaves 0 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is left with 0 (L), so you can make opponent lose. So n=4 is W.

n=5: possible moves are to 4 or 1. 4 is W, 1 is W. So all moves lead to W positions for the opponent. So n=5 is L.

n=6: possible moves are to 5 or 2. 5 is L, 2 is L. So if I can move to L, then n=6 is W. Wait, 5 is L and 2 is L. So from n=6, if I move to either 5 or 2, which are both losing positions, then opponent can't win. So n=6 is W.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if both options are L, then the current player can choose either and force the opponent into a losing position. So n=6 is W.

Wait, but let me re-examine:

n=5 is L, n=2 is L.

So from n=6, I can take 1, leaving 5 (L), which is good for me. So n=6 is W.

n=7: possible moves to 6 or 3. 6 is W, 3 is W. So both moves leave opponent in W. So n=7 is L.

n=8: move to 7 or 4. 7 is L, 4 is W. So I can move to 7, which is L, so n=8 is W.

n=9: move to 8 or 5. 8 is W, 5 is L. So I can move to 5 (L), so n=9 is W.

n=10: move to
