Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

The product is over k from 0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity, including ω^0 = 1. Each term in the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write that as 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}.

Wait, maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each term as a polynomial evaluated at ω^k and use properties of cyclotomic polynomials to find the product.

Let me consider a single term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write this as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks similar to a quadratic in ω^k. Let me denote z = ω^k, then the term becomes z² - 2z + 2.

So each term is z² - 2z + 2 where z is ω^k. Now, I can think of this as evaluating the polynomial P(z) = z² - 2z + 2 at each 13th root of unity z = ω^k, and then taking the product of P(z) over all z.

Therefore, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} P(ω^k) = ∏_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2). 

I remember that the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of unity can sometimes be related to cyclotomic polynomials. Specifically, the product over all roots z of z^n - 1 is equal to the product of cyclotomic polynomials. But here, I'm evaluating a different polynomial at each root.

Alternatively, I can think of this as taking the resultant or something similar. Wait, more precisely, the product ∏_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2) is equal to the resultant of z^13 -1 and z² - 2z +2, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, I remember that if f(z) is a polynomial, then ∏_{z^n=1} f(z) is equal to the product of f(z) over all n-th roots of unity. This can be expressed using the formula involving the greatest common divisor (gcd) of f(z) and z^n -1.

Wait, more accurately, ∏_{z^n=1} f(z) = ±Res(f, z^n -1), where Res is the resultant. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that for any polynomial f, ∏_{z^n=1} f(z) = gcd(f(z), z^n -1) ?

No, wait, that doesn't sound right. Maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

I recall that the product of f(z) over all roots z of unity of order n is equal to the product of f(z) for each z, which can be related to the resultant. But I'm not too familiar with resultants, so maybe another approach.

Another idea: Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, the minimal polynomial is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So any polynomial can be expressed in terms of Φ₁₃(x). But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the product ∏_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2). Let me denote this product as N. So N = ∏_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2).

I can write this as the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for all z with z^13 = 1.

But since z^13 = 1, we can also write this as the product over all 13th roots of unity. So N is the product over all z^13=1 of (z² - 2z + 2).

I think that can be expressed as the resultant of the polynomials x² - 2x + 2 and x¹³ - 1. Alternatively, it might be related to evaluating the resultant, but perhaps I can use another approach.

Wait, another idea: the product over all roots z of f(z) is equal to the absolute value squared of something if f(z) is a reciprocal polynomial, but maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, I remember that the product over all z^n=1 of (x - z) is x^n -1. So perhaps I can use that idea here, but instead of (x - z), I have (z² - 2z + 2), which
