Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of these chips in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Additionally, any extra chip we try to place would violate one or more of these conditions. So, we need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, okay. So, each row and each column has to be all one color, either all white or all black. But wait, not necessarily all white or all black—wait, no, because if a row has all white chips, then it's white, but a row could also have some chips, but all the same color. But wait, each cell can hold at most one chip, so a row can have some chips, but all the same color, or none. Same for columns.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says all chips in the same row have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color, either all white or all black. Same for the columns. So, for each row, it's either all white, all black, or empty? Wait, no, because "all chips in the same row" would have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color, either white or black, but they don't necessarily have to cover the entire row. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but wait, each cell can have at most one chip. So, a row could have, say, 3 white chips, but the other two cells in that row are empty. Then, since the row has some chips, they're all white, and the empty cells are just that—empty. But wait, the condition is about the chips in the row; the empty cells don't have chips, so I think that's acceptable.

But wait, there's another condition: any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So, after placing, if I try to add another chip anywhere, it would violate either the row condition or the column condition.

So, the placement is maximal in the sense that no more chips can be added without violating the row or column color
