Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. The hyperbola equation is given as (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right since the positive term is with x². 

The points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I have to find the infimum or the lower bound of BD², but the problem says the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, that wording is a bit tricky. Maybe it's the supremum of BD²? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, this number is the supremum of the lower bounds of BD². So, it's like the minimal upper bound on BD². Or wait, maybe it's the infimum. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Suppose for all rhombi, BD² is always greater than some number, and we need the greatest such number. So that number is the infimum of BD² over all such rhombi. Because if BD² is always greater than this number, but could get arbitrarily close, then that number is the infimum. So, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD², but since the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, it's the infimum.

Alternatively, perhaps BD² can get as small as possible, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum, because for some rhombi, BD² can be made as small as approaching the infimum from above. So, the number we need is the infimum.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about it differently. The problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, it's the supremum of all such lower bounds. So, it's the infimum of BD² over all rhombi. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound.

Wait, let me take
