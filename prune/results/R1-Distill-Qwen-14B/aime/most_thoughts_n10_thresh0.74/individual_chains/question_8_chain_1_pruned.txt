Okay, so I've got this problem here that asks me to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me break it down.

First, I know that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and their squares and products, sometimes symmetric expressions or factoring might help. Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, I notice that all the terms are symmetric in a, b, and c. That suggests there might be a way to factor or rewrite this expression in terms of symmetric polynomials. Let me think about how to manipulate this.

I remember that expressions like a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, the other terms can be grouped similarly. Let me try that.

So, the second equation can be rewritten as:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, since we know from the first equation that a + b + c = 300, we can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). That substitution might be helpful.

Let me substitute these into the equation:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Expanding each term, this becomes:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 300 to simplify:
(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Wait, that might complicate things because of the division. Maybe I should keep it as:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another way to express the second equation. Let me think about symmetric polynomials. I know that:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Is that correct? Let me verify. Let's expand (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):

= a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)
= a²b + a b c + a²c + a b² + b²c + b c a + a c² + b c² + c² a.

Wait, that seems like it's adding more terms. Let me count:

- a²b, a²c from the first term.
- a b², b²c from the second term.
- a c², b c², c²a from the third term.

Wait, but when I expand, I get each term once for each permutation. Hmm, actually, the expansion gives:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 3abc.

Because each term like abc appears three times—once when multiplying a*bc, b*ac, and c*ab.

So, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 3abc.

But in our second equation, we have a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c² = 6,000,000. So, that's equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Given that a + b + c = 300, this becomes:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So, now we have a new equation: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write that down:

Equation (1): a + b + c = 300.

Equation (2): 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, this seems more manageable. So, now I have two equations in terms of a, b, c. Maybe I can express ab + bc + ca in terms of S and P, where S is the sum and P is the product, but not sure yet.

Wait, let me denote:

Let S = a + b + c = 300.

Let Q = ab + bc + ca.

Let P = abc.

So, from equation (2), we have 100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

In symmetric terms, we know that for three variables, the cubic equation can be written as x³ - Sx² + Qx
