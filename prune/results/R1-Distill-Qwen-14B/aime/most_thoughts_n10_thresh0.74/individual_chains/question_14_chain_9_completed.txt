Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, after finding N, I have to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient Q and the remainder R.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the greatest such number, so maybe I should start from 9999 and work my way down until I find a number that satisfies the condition.

The key condition is that changing any digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number must be a multiple of 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, A is the thousands digit, B is hundreds, C is tens, and D is units.

So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. That means:

- Replacing A with 1: 1BCD is divisible by 7.
- Replacing B with 1: A1CD is divisible by 7.
- Replacing C with 1: AB1D is divisible by 7.
- Replacing D with 1: ABC1 is divisible by 7.

Therefore, all four numbers 1BCD, A1CD, AB1D, ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

Since we need the greatest N, I should start checking from 9999 downwards. But that might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the divisibility rules for 7. Divisibility by 7 isn't as straightforward as for 2 or 5, so I might need to use the actual division method or perhaps look at the number modulo 7.

Wait, another approach: For each digit position, the condition implies something about the original number N. Let's model this.

Let me consider each digit replacement:

1. Changing A to 1: So, 1BCD = 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D. This must be divisible by 7. Let me express this as (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly:

2. Changing B to 1: A1CD = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D. So, (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. Changing C to 1: AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D. So, (1000A + 100B + 10 + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. So, (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Now, N is the original number ABCD = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, each of these modified numbers must be congruent to 0 mod 7. Let's denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, for each digit replacement, I can write an equation involving N.

Let me think about each modified number:

1. 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this M1. Then M1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

But M1 = (1000 + (N - 1000A)). Because N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, so 100B + 10C + D = N - 1000A. Therefore, M1 = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

So, M1 = N - 1000A + 1000.

Similarly, for the other modified numbers:

2. A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Which is equal to N - 100B + 100.

So, M2 = N - 100B + 100.

3. AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Which is equal to N - 10C + 10.

So, M3 = N - 10C + 10.

4. ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Which is equal to N - D + 1.

So, M4 = N - D + 1.

Each of these M1, M2, M3, M4 must be divisible by 7. Therefore:

M1 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 1000A + 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly,

M2 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 100B + 100) ≡ 0 mod 7.

M3 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 10C + 10) ≡ 0 mod 7.

M4 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - D + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, let me write these congruences:

1. N - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7

2. N - 100B + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7

3. N - 10C + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7

4. N - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

I can rearrange each of these:

1. N ≡ 1000A - 1000 mod 7

2. N ≡ 100B - 100 mod 7

3. N ≡ 10C - 10 mod 7

4. N ≡ D - 1 mod 7

But since N is the same in all, all these expressions must be congruent to N modulo 7. So, N must satisfy all four congruences.

So, we can write:

1. N ≡ (1000A - 1000) mod 7

2. N ≡ (100B - 100) mod 7

3. N ≡ (10C - 10) mod 7

4. N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

But since N is the same in all, all four expressions must be congruent modulo 7.

So, let's compute each coefficient modulo 7.

First, 1000 mod 7: Let me compute 1000 / 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 -994=6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2, so 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

So, substituting these:

1. N ≡ (6A -6 ) mod7.

2. N ≡ (2B -2 ) mod7.

3. N ≡ (3C -3 ) mod7.

4. N ≡ (D -1 ) mod7.

So, all four expressions must equal N mod7. So, each of the right-hand sides must be congruent to each other.

Therefore, we can set them equal:

6A -6 ≡ 2B -2 mod7

6A -6 ≡ 3C -3 mod7

6A -6 ≡ D -1 mod7

Similarly,

2B -2 ≡ 3C -3 mod7

2B -2 ≡ D -1 mod7

3C -3 ≡ D -1 mod7

So, let's write these equations:

From the first pair: 6A -6 ≡ 2B -2 mod7.

Simplify:

6A -6 -2B +2 ≡ 0 mod7

6A - 2B -4 ≡ 0 mod7.

Similarly, 6A -2B ≡ 4 mod7.

Let me divide both sides by 2. Since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed. Multiplying both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, (6A - 2B) *4 ≡ 4*4 mod7.

Compute:

6*4=24≡3 mod7,

-2*4= -8≡-1 mod7.

So, 3A - B ≡ 16 mod7.

16 mod7 is 2, so:

3A - B ≡ 2 mod7. Equation 1.

Now, the next comparison: 6A -6 ≡ 3C -3 mod7.

Simplify:

6A -6 -3C +3 ≡ 0 mod7

6A - 3C -3 ≡ 0 mod7.

Divide through by 3: 2A - C -1 ≡0 mod7.

So, 2A - C ≡1 mod7. Equation 2.

Next, 6A -6 ≡ D -1 mod7.

Simplify:

6A -6 - D +1 ≡0 mod7

6A - D -5 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A - D ≡5 mod7. Equation 3.

Now, let's look at the other equations.

From 2B -2 ≡3C -3 mod7.

Simplify:

2B -2 -3C +3 ≡0 mod7

2B -3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, 2B -3C ≡-1 mod7, which is 6 mod7.

Equation 4: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

From 2B -2 ≡D -1 mod7.

Simplify:

2B -2 - D +1 ≡0 mod7

2B - D -1 ≡0 mod7.

So, 2B - D ≡1 mod7. Equation 5.

From 3C -3 ≡D -1 mod7.

Simplify:

3C -3 - D +1 ≡0 mod7

3C - D -2 ≡0 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡2 mod7. Equation 6.

So, now I have several equations:

Equation 1: 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Equation 2: 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Equation 3: 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Equation 4: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Equation 5: 2B - D ≡1 mod7.

Equation 6: 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So, that's a system of equations with variables A, B, C, D (each between 0-9, with A≥1 since it's a four-digit number).

Let me try to solve this system step by step.

From equation 1: 3A - B ≡2 mod7 → B ≡3A -2 mod7.

From equation 2: 2A - C ≡1 mod7 → C ≡2A -1 mod7.

From equation 3: 6A - D ≡5 mod7 → D ≡6A -5 mod7.

From equation 4: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

But from equation 1 and 2, we can substitute B and C in terms of A.

So, substitute B=3A -2 mod7 and C=2A -1 mod7 into equation 4.

Equation4: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Plugging B and C:

2*(3A -2) -3*(2A -1) ≡6 mod7.

Compute:

6A -4 -6A +3 ≡6 mod7.

Simplify:

(6A -6A) + (-4 +3) ≡6 mod7.

So, (-1) ≡6 mod7.

But -1 mod7 is 6, so yes, this holds. So equation 4 is automatically satisfied given equations 1 and 2.

Now, let's check equation 5: 2B - D ≡1 mod7.

From equation 3, D ≡6A -5 mod7.

From equation 1, B ≡3A -2 mod7.

So, 2B = 2*(3A -2) =6A -4 mod7.

D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, 2B - D ≡ (6A -4) - (6A -5) mod7.

Which is 6A -4 -6A +5 = 1 mod7.

So, 1 ≡1 mod7, which holds.

Similarly, equation6: 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

From equation2, C=2A -1 mod7.

So, 3C=3*(2A -1)=6A -3 mod7.

D=6A -5 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡ (6A -3) - (6A -5) mod7.

Which is 6A -3 -6A +5 =2 mod7.

Which is 2≡2 mod7, so that holds.

Therefore, all equations are consistent with each other, given equations 1,2,3.

So, the system reduces to:

B ≡3A -2 mod7.

C ≡2A -1 mod7.

D ≡6A -5 mod7.

With A being from 1 to9, B, C, D from 0 to9, and N being the largest four-digit number.

Given that, I can model this as:

For each A (1 to9), compute B, C, D as:

B = (3A -2) mod7. But since B is a digit, it can be (3A -2) +7k, where k is such that B is between 0 and9.

Similarly, C=(2A -1) mod7. So, C=(2A-1)+7m, where m is such that C is 0-9.

D=(6A -5) mod7. So, D=(6A -5)+7n, where n is such that D is 0-9.

But since A is from1 to9, let's compute for each A:

Calculate B, C, D as the minimum possible value in their digit range, but since we're seeking the largest N, which is 1000A +100B +10C +D, we need to maximize A first, then B, then C, then D.

So, starting from A=9, let's compute B, C, D:

For A=9:

B = (3*9 -2) mod7 → (27-2)=25 mod7. 25/7=3*7=21, 25-21=4. So, B=4.

But to get the maximum possible B, since B can be 4 +7k. But since B is a digit, the maximum possible is 9. So 4 +7=11 which is invalid. So, the maximum B for A=9 is 4.

C=(2*9 -1)=17 mod7. 17/7=2*7=14, 17-14=3. So, C=3.

To maximize C, can we add 7? 3+7=10, which is invalid as a digit. So, C=3.

D=(6*9 -5)=54-5=49 mod7. 49 is 0 mod7. So, D=0.

But to maximize D, D=0+7=7, but wait, 49 mod7=0, so D=0. But can D be higher? No, because 0 is the remainder. Wait, no. Wait, D is supposed to be (6A -5) mod7, which is 0. So, D=0.

So, for A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0.

So, N=9430.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if each digit replacement gives a number divisible by7.

So, N=9430.

Check changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1: 1430. Is 1430 divisible by7? Let's compute 1430 ÷7.

7*200=1400, 1430-1400=30. 30 ÷7 is about 4.28, so 7*4=28, 30-28=2. So, remainder 2. Not divisible by7. Therefore, N=9430 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, maybe A=9 is too high, but perhaps we need to adjust B, C, or D to get a number where all digit replacements work.

Wait, but according to the earlier equations, when A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0. But when we change A to1, we get 1430, which isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps our approach is missing something. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, the equations we set up were based on congruences, but perhaps we need more constraints.

Wait, let me think: the conditions are that when you replace any digit with 1, the number is divisible by7. So, N itself isn't necessarily divisible by7, but all modified versions are.

Wait, but from the equations, we have N ≡ something mod7. Let me see.

From equation1: N ≡6A -6 mod7.

For A=9, 6*9=54, 54-6=48. 48 mod7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6. So, N ≡6 mod7.

So, N=9430 is 9430 mod7. Let's compute 9430 ÷7.

7*1347=9429, so 9430-9429=1. So, 9430≡1 mod7.

But according to equation1, N should be 6 mod7. So, there's a discrepancy here.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps our earlier equations are not considering the actual value of N mod7 correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting.

Wait, let's double-check:

From M1 =1BCD =1000 + 100B +10C + D.

Which is equal to 1000 + (N - 1000A).

So, M1 = N -1000A +1000.

Then, M1 ≡0 mod7.

So, N -1000A +1000 ≡0 mod7.

Which is N ≡1000A -1000 mod7.

Wait, earlier I computed 1000 mod7=6, so 1000A mod7=6A, and 1000 mod7=6.

So, 1000A -1000 mod7=6A -6 mod7.

So, N ≡6A -6 mod7.

But N is 9430, which is 1 mod7. Let's check 6A -6 for A=9: 6*9=54, 54-6=48, 48 mod7=6. So, N should be 6 mod7.

But 9430 mod7 is 1, not 6. That's a contradiction. Therefore, our earlier approach might have an error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-examine the equations.

Wait, M1 =1BCD =1000 +100B +10C + D.

But N =1000A +100B +10C + D.

So, M1 =1000 + (N -1000A).

So, M1 = N -1000A +1000.

So, M1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒ N -1000A +1000 ≡0 mod7 ⇒ N ≡1000A -1000 mod7.

So, N ≡ (1000A -1000) mod7.

But 1000 mod7=6, so 1000A mod7=6A, and 1000 mod7=6.

So, N ≡6A -6 mod7.

But when A=9, that's 6*9 -6=48, which is 6 mod7. But N=9430 is 1 mod7.

So, there's a conflict. Therefore, perhaps for A=9, the system of equations doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust B, C, D such that N is indeed 6 mod7.

Wait, but how?

I think the problem is that when I computed B, C, D as (3A-2), (2A-1), (6A-5) mod7, I didn't account for the fact that N must also satisfy N ≡6A -6 mod7.

So, perhaps for each A, after computing B, C, D, I need to ensure that N=1000A +100B +10C +D is ≡6A -6 mod7.

So, let's model this.

For each A from9 down to1:

Compute B=(3A-2) mod7, but B is a digit (0-9), so B can be (3A-2) +7k where k is 0 or1, as adding 7 would make it a two-digit number only if k=2, but 3A-2 for A=9 is 25, which is more than 9, but when mod7, 25 mod7=4, so B=4.

Wait, but perhaps B can be higher if we add 7. For example, for A=9, B=4, but adding 7 would give 11, which is invalid.

So, B must be 4.

Similarly, C= (2A-1) mod7. For A=9, 17 mod7=3. So, C=3. Adding 7 would make it 10, invalid. So, C=3.

D=(6A-5) mod7. For A=9, 54-5=49 mod7=0. So, D=0. Adding 7 would make it 7, which is valid since D is a digit. So, D can be 0 or7.

Wait, but D must satisfy D ≡0 mod7. So, D can be 0 or7.

But wait, in the equation3: D ≡6A -5 mod7. For A=9: 6*9=54, 54-5=49≡0 mod7. So, D must be 0 or7.

But D is a digit, so possible D=0 or7.

So, for A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7.

So, N could be 9430 or9437.

But we need to check which one of these, when any digit is changed to1, is divisible by7.

Let's check N=9437.

Changing A to1: 1437.

Check 1437 ÷7. 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. So, remainder 2. Not divisible by7. So, N=9437 doesn't satisfy.

Wait, so perhaps A=9 is not possible.

Wait, let's check N=9430. But as before, changing A to1 gives 1430, which isn't divisible by7.

Hmm, so perhaps A=9 is impossible. So, we need to try A=8.

Let me try A=8.

Compute B, C, D:

B=(3*8 -2)=22 mod7. 22-3*7=1. So, B=1. But 1 is less than 8. Wait, wait, 3A-2=22, which is 22 mod7=1. So, B=1.

But wait, is B=1 the only possibility? Or can we have B=1+7=8? Since B is a digit, yes, B could be8.

So, B can be1 or8.

Similarly, C=(2*8 -1)=15 mod7=1. So, C=1. Or C=1+7=8.

D=(6*8 -5)=43 mod7. 43-6*7=1. So, D=1. Or D=1+7=8.

So, for A=8, possible combinations:

B can be1 or8.

C can be1 or8.

D can be1 or8.

But we need to choose B, C, D such that N is as large as possible. So, to maximize N, we should choose the largest possible B, C, D.

So, B=8, C=8, D=8.

Thus, N=8888.

Wait, let me check if this satisfies the conditions.

Changing any digit to1:

1. Changing A=8 to1: 1888.

Check 1888 ÷7. 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Not divisible by7. So, 1888 isn't divisible by7. So, N=8888 doesn't work.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to find another combination.

Wait, but maybe the maximum N is not 8888, but a lower number.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose B, C, D such that when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7.

So, for A=8, let's compute N=8BCD, where B, C, D are either1 or8.

Wait, but this might not be straightforward. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that N must satisfy all four modified numbers being divisible by7. So, perhaps I can set up equations for each modified number and solve for the digits.

But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the difference between N and each modified number is a multiple of7.

For example, when changing A to1, M1=1BCD. So, N - M1 =1000A -1000. So, N - M1 must be divisible by7.

Similarly, N - M1 =1000(A -1). So, 1000(A -1) must be divisible by7.

But 1000≡6 mod7, so 6*(A-1)≡0 mod7.

Which implies that (A-1) must be ≡0 mod7, since 6 and7 are coprime.

So, A-1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒ A≡1 mod7.

Since A is a digit from1-9, possible A values are1 and8.

Because 1≡1 mod7, 8≡1 mod7 (since 8-7=1).

So, A can be1 or8.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So, A must be ≡1 mod7. So, A=1 or8.

That reduces our options.

So, A is either1 or8.

Since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, A=8 is better.

So, A=8.

So, N=8BCD.

Now, from earlier, we have:

M1=1BCD must be divisible by7.

M2=A1CD must be divisible by7.

M3=AB1D must be divisible by7.

M4=ABC1 must be divisible by7.

So, let's compute each modified number:

M1=1BCD=1000 +100B +10C + D.

M2=81CD=8000 +100 +10C + D=8100 +10C + D.

M3=8B1D=8000 +100B +10 + D.

M4=8BC1=8000 +100B +10C +1.

Each of these must be divisible by7.

So, let's write each condition:

1. 1000 +100B +10C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. 8100 +10C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. 8000 +100B +10 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. 8000 +100B +10C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Let me compute each of these modulo7.

First, compute the constants modulo7.

1000 mod7=6.

100 mod7=2.

10 mod7=3.

1 mod7=1.

8000 mod7: Let's compute 8000 ÷7.

7*1142=7994, 8000-7994=6. So, 8000≡6 mod7.

8100 mod7: 8100=8000+100. So, 6 +2=8≡1 mod7.

8000 mod7=6.

100 mod7=2.

10 mod7=3.

1 mod7=1.

So, rewriting each condition:

1. 6 + 2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. 1 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. 6 + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. 6 + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify each equation:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7. (Because 6 + ... ≡0 ⇒ ... ≡1)

2. 3C + D ≡6 mod7. (1 + ... ≡0 ⇒ ... ≡6)

3. 2B + D ≡1 mod7. (6 +3 + ...≡0 ⇒ ...≡1)

4. 2B +3C ≡0 mod7. (6 +3C +1 ≡0 ⇒ ...≡0)

So, now we have four equations:

Equation1: 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Equation2: 3C + D ≡6 mod7.

Equation3: 2B + D ≡1 mod7.

Equation4: 2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

Let me solve these equations.

First, from equation2: 3C + D ≡6 mod7.

From equation3: 2B + D ≡1 mod7.

Subtract equation3 from equation2:

(3C + D) - (2B + D) ≡6 -1 mod7.

So, 3C -2B ≡5 mod7.

But from equation4: 2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

So, we have:

3C -2B ≡5 mod7.

2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

Let me add these two equations:

(3C -2B) + (2B +3C) ≡5 +0 mod7.

Which gives 6C ≡5 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of6 mod7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse is6.

Thus, C≡5*6 mod7=30 mod7=2 mod7.

So, C≡2 mod7. Since C is a digit, possible C=2 or9.

Wait, 2 mod7=2, and 2+7=9. So, C=2 or9.

Now, from equation4: 2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

Case1: C=2.

Then, 2B +3*2=2B +6 ≡0 mod7 ⇒ 2B ≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by4 (inverse of2 mod7):

B≡4*1=4 mod7.

So, B=4 or11. But B is a digit, so B=4.

Case1: C=2, B=4.

From equation3: 2B + D ≡1 mod7.

2*4=8≡1 mod7. So, 1 + D ≡1 mod7 ⇒ D≡0 mod7.

So, D=0 or7.

From equation2: 3C + D= 6 + D ≡6 mod7.

So, 6 + D ≡6 mod7 ⇒ D≡0 mod7.

Thus, D=0 or7.

So, for C=2, B=4, D=0 or7.

So, possible N=8 4 2 0 or8 4 2 7.

So, N=8420 or8427.

Check which one satisfies all conditions.

First, N=8420.

Check changing each digit to1:

1. Change A=8→1:1420.

Check 1420 ÷7. 7*202=1414, 1420-1414=6. So, remainder6. Not divisible by7.

So, N=8420 doesn't work.

Next, N=8427.

Change A=8→1:1427.

Check 1427 ÷7. 7*203=1421, 1427-1421=6. Remainder6. Not divisible by7.

So, N=8427 also doesn't work.

Hmm, so C=2 doesn't work. Let's try C=9.

Case2: C=9.

From equation4: 2B +3*9=2B +27≡2B +6 mod7 (since 27 mod7=6).

So, 2B +6 ≡0 mod7 ⇒2B≡1 mod7.

Multiply by4: B≡4 mod7.

So, B=4 or11. Since B is a digit, B=4.

From equation3: 2B + D ≡1 mod7.

2*4=8≡1 mod7. So, 1 + D ≡1 mod7 ⇒D≡0 mod7.

So, D=0 or7.

From equation2:3C + D=27 + D≡6 + D mod7.

So, 6 + D ≡6 mod7 ⇒ D≡0 mod7.

Thus, D=0 or7.

So, N=8 4 9 0 or8 4 9 7.

Let's check N=8490.

Changing A=8→1:1490.

1490 ÷7=212.857... 7*212=1484, 1490-1484=6. Not divisible.

N=8490 doesn't work.

N=8497.

Change A=8→1:1497.

1497 ÷7=213.857... 7*213=1491, 1497-1491=6. Not divisible.

So, both N=8490 and8497 don't work.

Hmm, so C=9 also doesn't give a valid N.

Wait, but according to our equations, C=2 and9 are the only possibilities. But neither gives a valid N.

So, this suggests that A=8 might not be possible. But earlier, we saw that A must be1 or8 because A≡1 mod7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my equations.

Let me re-express the four equations again.

Equation1: 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Equation2:3C + D ≡6 mod7.

Equation3:2B + D ≡1 mod7.

Equation4:2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

From equation4:2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

From equation2:3C + D ≡6 mod7.

From equation3:2B + D ≡1 mod7.

Subtract equation3 from equation2: (3C + D) - (2B + D) ≡6 -1 mod7.

3C -2B ≡5 mod7.

But from equation4: 2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

So, adding these two equations:

(3C -2B) + (2B +3C) ≡5 +0 mod7.

6C≡5 mod7.

Multiply both sides by6: 6*6C≡6*5 mod7.

Which is (36C)≡30 mod7.

36 mod7=1, 30 mod7=2.

So, C≡2 mod7.

So, C=2 or9. That's correct.

Then, from equation4:2B +3C ≡0 mod7.

Case1: C=2.

2B +6≡0 mod7 ⇒2B≡1 mod7 ⇒B≡4 mod7.

So, B=4 or11, but B=4.

From equation3:2B + D ≡1 mod7 ⇒8 + D≡1 mod7 ⇒D≡1 -1=0 mod7.

So, D=0 or7.

From equation2:3*2 + D=6 + D≡6 mod7 ⇒D≡0 mod7.

So, D=0 or7.

So, N=8420 or8427.

But as we saw, both fail when changing A.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the equations differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that when changing a digit, the resulting number must be divisible by7, not that N itself has to be a certain value.

But according to our earlier reasoning, A must be1 or8.

Since A=8 is higher, let's proceed.

Wait, maybe I need to allow B, C, D to be different values beyond just (3A-2), etc.

Wait, but earlier, from the system of equations, we derived that B=4, C=2 or9, D=0 or7.

But perhaps for A=8, we can have other combinations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when changing a digit to1, the resulting number must be divisible by7, but N itself doesn't have to be in a particular congruence class.

Wait, but earlier, when changing A to1, M1=1BCD must be divisible by7, and M1 = N -1000(A-1). So, N -1000(A-1) ≡0 mod7.

Which implies N ≡1000(A-1) mod7.

Since 1000≡6 mod7, N ≡6(A-1) mod7.

Similarly, when changing B to1, M2=A1CD.

M2 = N -100(B-1).

So, N -100(B-1) ≡0 mod7 ⇒ N ≡100(B-1) mod7.

100≡2 mod7, so N ≡2(B-1) mod7.

Similarly, changing C to1: M3=AB1D.

M3 = N -10(C-1).

So, N ≡10(C-1) mod7.

10≡3 mod7, so N ≡3(C-1) mod7.

Changing D to1: M4=ABC1.

M4 = N - (D-1).

So, N ≡(D-1) mod7.

So, N must satisfy:

N ≡6(A-1) mod7,

N ≡2(B-1) mod7,

N ≡3(C-1) mod7,

N ≡(D-1) mod7.

So, all four congruences must hold.

So, for A=8:

N ≡6*(8-1)=6*7=42≡0 mod7.

So, N≡0 mod7.

Similarly, from other equations:

N≡2(B-1) mod7.

N≡3(C-1) mod7.

N≡(D-1) mod7.

So, N must be ≡0 mod7.

So, from N≡(D-1) mod7 ⇒ D-1≡0 mod7 ⇒ D≡1 mod7.

So, D=1 or8.

Similarly, from N≡3(C-1) mod7 ⇒3(C-1)≡0 mod7 ⇒C-1≡0 mod7 ⇒C=1 or8.

From N≡2(B-1) mod7 ⇒2(B-1)≡0 mod7 ⇒B-1≡0 mod7 ⇒B=1 or8.

So, B, C, D must be ≡1 mod7, meaning they can be1 or8.

So, B=1 or8.

C=1 or8.

D=1 or8.

So, for A=8, N=8 B C D, where B, C, D ∈{1,8}.

To find the largest N, we need to maximize B, C, D.

So, set B=8, C=8, D=8.

Thus, N=8888.

But earlier, when I checked, changing A=8 to1 gives1888, which isn't divisible by7.

But according to the congruence, N=8888 must be ≡0 mod7.

Compute 8888 ÷7: 7*1269=8883, 8888-8883=5. So, 8888≡5 mod7, not0. So, that's a problem.

Wait, that suggests that our earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, according to the condition, N must be ≡0 mod7.

But 8888 mod7=5, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the congruence.

Let me recompute:

From changing A to1: N - 1000(A-1) ≡0 mod7.

So, N ≡1000(A-1) mod7.

For A=8, 1000*(7)=7000. 7000 mod7=0. So, N ≡0 mod7.

But N=8888 mod7=5≠0.

So, conflict.

Wait, perhaps the earlier equations are more accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to set up the equations differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the difference between N and the modified numbers.

For example, when changing A to1, the difference is 1000*(A-1). So, N - M1=1000*(A-1).

For M1 to be divisible by7, N -1000*(A-1) ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, for other digits:

N -100*(B-1) ≡0 mod7.

N -10*(C-1) ≡0 mod7.

N - (D-1) ≡0 mod7.

So, four congruences:

1. N ≡1000*(A-1) mod7.

2. N ≡100*(B-1) mod7.

3. N ≡10*(C-1) mod7.

4. N ≡(D-1) mod7.

So, for A=8:

1. N ≡1000*7 mod7=0 mod7.

2. N ≡100*(B-1) mod7=2*(B-1) mod7.

3. N ≡10*(C-1) mod7=3*(C-1) mod7.

4. N ≡(D-1) mod7.

So, all four congruences must hold.

From 1, N≡0 mod7.

From 4, D≡1 mod7.

From 3, 3*(C-1)≡0 mod7 ⇒C≡1 mod7.

From 2, 2*(B-1)≡0 mod7 ⇒B≡1 mod7.

So, B, C, D must be1 or8.

So, N=8 B C D, with B, C, D ∈{1,8}.

But as we saw, N=8888 doesn't satisfy N≡0 mod7.

Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute N mod7 correctly.

Compute N=8888:

8888 ÷7=1269.714... 7*1269=8883, 8888-8883=5 ⇒8888≡5 mod7.

But according to condition1, N≡0 mod7.

So, conflict.

This suggests that N=8888 isn't acceptable, despite B, C, D being1 or8.

Wait, but according to the equations, N must be ≡0 mod7. So, perhaps the only way is to find N=8BCD where B, C, D are1 or8, and N≡0 mod7.

So, let's try all possible combinations:

Possible N:

8111: 8111 mod7. 7*1158=8106, 8111-8106=5. Not 0.

8118: 8118 mod7. 7*1159=8113, 8118-8113=5. Not 0.

8181: 8181 mod7. 7*1168=8176, 8181-8176=5. Not 0.

8188: 8188 mod7=8188-7*1169=8188-8183=5. Not 0.

8811: 8811 mod7. 7*1258=8806, 8811-8806=5. Not 0.

8818: 8818-7*1259=8818-8813=5. Not0.

8881: 8881-7*1268=8881-8876=5. Not0.

8888: 8883+5=8888. So, 5 mod7.

So, none of these N with A=8 and B,C,D=1 or8 are ≡0 mod7. So, perhaps A=8 is impossible.

So, moving to A=1.

A=1.

From the earlier equations:

B= (3A -2) mod7= (3-2)=1 mod7. So, B=1 or8.

C=(2A -1)=2-1=1 mod7. So, C=1 or8.

D=(6A -5)=6 -5=1 mod7. So, D=1 or8.

So, N=1 B C D, with B, C, D=1 or8.

To maximize N, set B=8, C=8, D=8. So, N=1888.

Check if N=1888 satisfies the conditions.

Changing any digit to1:

1. Change A=1→1: same number, which is1888. 1888 ÷7=269.714... 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Not divisible.

Wait, but the condition says "when one of its digits is changed to1". So, changing A to1 doesn't change the number. So, perhaps that's allowed, but the number must be divisible by7.

But 1888 isn't divisible by7, so N=1888 doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to avoid changing A to1 if A is already1.

Wait, but the problem says "when one of its digits is changed to1". So, if a digit is already1, changing it to1 doesn't change the number. So, in that case, the number must be divisible by7.

So, for N=1888, since A=1, changing A to1 gives the same number, which must be divisible by7. But 1888 isn't, so N=1888 doesn't work.

So, perhaps we need to choose B, C, D such that when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7.

So, let's try N=1111.

Changing any digit to1 doesn't change the number, which is1111. 1111 ÷7=158.714... Not divisible.

So, N=1111 doesn't work.

Next, try N=1118.

Change D=8→1:1111, which isn't divisible.

Change C=1→1: same number, which isn't.

Hmm, this approach might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps A=1 is also impossible, but that can't be because the problem states that such a number exists.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think differently.

Since A must be1 or8, and A=8 didn't work, perhaps I need to consider that A=8 with different B, C, D that aren't necessarily1 or8.

Wait, but earlier, from the congruences, B, C, D must be ≡1 mod7, meaning they have to be1 or8.

But that leads to N=8BCD where B, C, D=1 or8, but none of those numbers are ≡0 mod7.

So, perhaps the only possibility is A=1.

Wait, but when A=1, N=1BCD, and we need N≡0 mod7.

From the earlier congruence, N must be≡0 mod7.

So, N=1BCD must be≡0 mod7.

But to find the greatest four-digit number, perhaps A=1 is too low.

Wait, but the problem says the greatest four-digit number. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that A must be1 or8 is incorrect.

Wait, let's go back.

Earlier, I thought that from M1=1BCD and N -1000(A-1) ≡0 mod7, which implies N≡1000(A-1) mod7.

But 1000≡6 mod7, so N≡6(A-1) mod7.

Similarly, from M2=A1CD, N≡100(B-1) mod7≡2(B-1) mod7.

From M3=AB1D, N≡10(C-1) mod7≡3(C-1) mod7.

From M4=ABC1, N≡(D-1) mod7.

So, all four congruences must hold.

So, N must satisfy:

N ≡6(A-1) mod7,

N ≡2(B-1) mod7,

N ≡3(C-1) mod7,

N ≡(D-1) mod7.

These four must all be equal.

So, 6(A-1) ≡2(B-1) ≡3(C-1) ≡(D-1) mod7.

Let me denote this common value as k mod7.

So,

6(A-1) ≡k,

2(B-1) ≡k,

3(C-1) ≡k,

(D-1) ≡k.

So, from these:

A-1 ≡k * inv6 mod7,

B-1 ≡k * inv2 mod7,

C-1 ≡k * inv3 mod7,

D-1 ≡k mod7.

Where inv6 is the inverse of6 mod7, which is6, since6*6=36≡1 mod7.

Similarly, inv2=4, since2*4=8≡1 mod7.

inv3=5, since3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So,

A-1 ≡6k mod7,

B-1 ≡4k mod7,

C-1 ≡5k mod7,

D-1 ≡k mod7.

So, for each k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6, we can compute A, B, C, D.

But A must be a digit from1-9, B,C,D from0-9.

Let me choose k=0:

Then,

A-1≡0 ⇒A=1,

B-1≡0 ⇒B=1,

C-1≡0 ⇒C=1,

D-1≡0 ⇒D=1.

So, N=1111.

But as before, 1111 isn't divisible by7 when any digit is changed to1, except itself.

So, not acceptable.

k=1:

A-1≡6*1=6 mod7 ⇒A=7.

B-1≡4*1=4 ⇒B=5.

C-1≡5*1=5 ⇒C=6.

D-1≡1 ⇒D=2.

So, N=7 5 6 2=7562.

Check if changing any digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

Change A=7→1:1562.

1562 ÷7=223.142... 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. Not divisible.

So, N=7562 doesn't work.

k=2:

A-1≡6*2=12≡5 mod7 ⇒A=6.

B-1≡4*2=8≡1 ⇒B=2.

C-1≡5*2=10≡3 ⇒C=4.

D-1≡2 ⇒D=3.

So, N=6 2 4 3=6243.

Check changing A=6→1:1243.

1243 ÷7=177.571... 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4. Not divisible.

So, N=6243 doesn't work.

k=3:

A-1≡6*3=18≡4 ⇒A=5.

B-1≡4*3=12≡5 ⇒B=6.

C-1≡5*3=15≡1 ⇒C=2.

D-1≡3 ⇒D=4.

N=5 6 2 4=5624.

Change A=5→1:1624.

1624 ÷7=232. So, 7*232=1624. Exactly divisible. Good.

Change B=6→1:5124.

5124 ÷7=732. So, 7*732=5124. Divisible.

Change C=2→1:5614.

5614 ÷7=802. So, 7*802=5614. Divisible.

Change D=4→1:5621.

5621 ÷7=803. So, 7*803=5621. Divisible.

Wow, so N=5624 satisfies all conditions.

But is this the greatest possible?

Wait, let's check higher k values.

k=4:

A-1≡6*4=24≡3 ⇒A=4.

B-1≡4*4=16≡2 ⇒B=3.

C-1≡5*4=20≡6 ⇒C=7.

D-1≡4 ⇒D=5.

N=4 3 7 5=4375.

Check changing A=4→1:1375.

1375 ÷7=196.428... 7*196=1372, 1375-1372=3. Not divisible.

So, N=4375 doesn't work.

k=5:

A-1≡6*5=30≡2 ⇒A=3.

B-1≡4*5=20≡6 ⇒B=7.

C-1≡5*5=25≡4 ⇒C=5.

D-1≡5 ⇒D=6.

N=3 7 5 6=3756.

Change A=3→1:1756.

1756 ÷7=250.857... 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6. Not divisible.

So, N=3756 doesn't work.

k=6:

A-1≡6*6=36≡1 ⇒A=2.

B-1≡4*6=24≡3 ⇒B=4.

C-1≡5*6=30≡2 ⇒C=3.

D-1≡6 ⇒D=7.

N=2 4 3 7=2437.

Check changing A=2→1:1437.

1437 ÷7=205.285... 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. Not divisible.

So, N=2437 doesn't work.

So, among all k values, only k=3 gives a valid N=5624.

But wait, earlier, when k=3, N=5624.

But we were trying to find the greatest four-digit number. So, is there a higher N?

Wait, earlier when A=8, we saw that N=8BCD with B, C, D=1 or8 didn't work because N wasn't divisible by7. But perhaps there's another way.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when changing a digit, the resulting number must be divisible by7, but N itself doesn't have to be.

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, N must satisfy four congruence conditions, which led us to N=5624 as the only valid number.

But the problem states that N is the greatest four-digit number with that property. So, perhaps N=5624 is the answer.

Wait, but 5624 seems low. Maybe I missed a higher N.

Wait, let's try to see if there's a higher N than5624 that satisfies the condition.

Let me think of N=7777.

Changing any digit to1 gives1777, 7177,7717,7771.

Check if these are divisible by7.

1777 ÷7=253.857... 7*253=1771, 1777-1771=6. Not divisible.

So, N=7777 doesn't work.

N=7770.

Change A=7→1:1770.

1770 ÷7=252.857... 7*252=1764, 1770-1764=6. Not divisible.

N=7700.

Change A=7→1:1700.

1700 ÷7=242.857... 7*242=1694, 1700-1694=6. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check N=5624.

As before, changing any digit to1 gives:

1624, 5124, 5614,5621.

All of these are divisible by7.

So, N=5624 works.

But is there a higher N?

Wait, maybe I can try N=5624 + 1000=6624.

But N=6624.

Check changing A=6→1:1624, which is divisible by7.

But let's check other changes.

Change B=6→1:6124.

6124 ÷7=874.857... 7*874=6118, 6124-6118=6. Not divisible.

So, N=6624 doesn't work.

Wait, another approach: since N=5624 works, let's see if there's a higher N where changing any digit to1 gives a multiple of7.

Let me try N=5624 +7=5631.

But changing D=1→1: same number. 5631 ÷7=804.428... Not divisible.

So, doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps N=5624 +1000=6624, which we saw doesn't work.

Alternatively, let's try N=5624 + 100=5724.

Check changing A=5→1:1724.

1724 ÷7=246.285... Not divisible.

So, no.

Alternatively, N=5624 + 10=5634.

Change D=4→1:5631, which isn't divisible by7.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps N=5624 + 1000=6624, but as before, changing B=6→1 gives6124, which isn't divisible.

Alternatively, perhaps N=5624 + 10000=15624, but that's a five-digit number, which is beyond our scope.

Wait, maybe I need to look for numbers between5624 and9999 where changing any digit to1 results in a multiple of7.

But that's a lot of numbers to check. Maybe I can find another N by choosing different k values.

Wait, earlier, when k=3, N=5624. Let me see if there are other k values that give higher N.

Wait, but when k=3, A=5. To get a higher A, perhaps we need a different k.

Wait, for k=3, A=5. To get A=6, we'd need a different k.

Wait, let's see:

From earlier, for each k, A is determined as A= (k*inv6 +1) mod7.

Wait, for k=0: A=1,

k=1: A=7,

k=2: A=6,

k=3: A=5,

k=4: A=4,

k=5: A=3,

k=6: A=2.

So, the highest A is7 when k=1.

So, for k=1, A=7.

But earlier, when k=1, N=7562 didn't work.

But perhaps there's another N with A=7 that works.

Wait, when k=1, N=7562.

But changing A=7→1 gives1562, which isn't divisible.

But maybe there's another N with A=7 that works.

Wait, let's try N=7777, but as before, it doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps N=7744.

Change A=7→1:1744.

1744 ÷7=249.142... 7*249=1743, 1744-1743=1. Not divisible.

N=7744 doesn't work.

Alternatively, N=7753.

Change A=7→1:1753.

1753 ÷7=250.428... 7*250=1750, 1753-1750=3. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think differently. Since N must be ≡0 mod7, as per the earlier congruence when k=3, let's find the largest N=abcd where a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4, and N=5624.

But maybe there's a larger N with a=5, but higher b, c, d.

Wait, N=5624 is the only one that worked. Let me check N=5624 + 7=5631. But changing D=1→1: same number, which isn't divisible.

Alternatively, N=5624 + 14=5638.

But changing D=8→1:5631, which isn't divisible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when changing a digit to1, the resulting number must be divisible by7, regardless of N's congruence.

So, perhaps I can find N such that for each digit position, replacing it with1 gives a multiple of7.

But this might require a different approach.

Let me think of the four modified numbers:

1. 1BCD must be divisible by7.

2. A1CD must be divisible by7.

3. AB1D must be divisible by7.

4. ABC1 must be divisible by7.

So, for each position, the modified number is divisible by7.

So, perhaps I can model each modified number as 7k for some integer k.

But this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the differences between the modified numbers and N.

For example, when changing A to1, the difference is 1000*(A-1). So, N -1000*(A-1) must be divisible by7.

Similarly, for other digits:

N -100*(B-1) must be divisible by7.

N -10*(C-1) must be divisible by7.

N - (D-1) must be divisible by7.

So, as before, N must satisfy:

N ≡1000*(A-1) mod7,

N ≡100*(B-1) mod7,

N ≡10*(C-1) mod7,

N ≡(D-1) mod7.

Which simplifies to:

N ≡6(A-1) mod7,

N ≡2(B-1) mod7,

N ≡3(C-1) mod7,

N ≡(D-1) mod7.

So, all four congruences must hold.

Let me try to find N=abcd where a=7, and see if such N exists.

Set A=7.

Then,

N ≡6*(7-1)=36≡1 mod7.

So, N ≡1 mod7.

From the other congruences:

N ≡2(B-1) mod7,

N ≡3(C-1) mod7,

N ≡(D-1) mod7.

So,

2(B-1) ≡1 mod7 ⇒2(B-1) ≡1 ⇒Multiply both sides by4: B-1≡4 ⇒B=5.

3(C-1) ≡1 ⇒Multiply both sides by5: C-1≡5 ⇒C=6.

(D-1)≡1 ⇒D=2.

So, N=7 B C D=7 5 6 2=7562.

But earlier, when I checked, changing A=7→1 gives1562, which isn't divisible by7.

Wait, but according to the congruence, N=7562 ≡1 mod7.

But 7562 ÷7=1080.285... 7*1080=7560, 7562-7560=2. So, 7562≡2 mod7, not1. Contradiction.

So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the congruence.

Wait, N=7562.

Compute N mod7: 7*1000=7000, 7562-7000=562.

562 ÷7=80.285... 7*80=560, 562-560=2. So, 7562≡2 mod7.

But according to the congruence, N≡1 mod7. So, conflict.

This suggests that N=7562 doesn't satisfy the congruence, hence it's invalid.

So, perhaps A=7 is impossible.

Wait, but according to the equations, when A=7, N must be≡1 mod7, but N=7562 is≡2 mod7. So, that's a problem.

Therefore, perhaps A=7 isn't allowed, or maybe I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the congruences correctly.

Wait, when A=7, N must satisfy:

N ≡6*(7-1)=36≡1 mod7.

So, N must be≡1 mod7.

But N=7562≡2 mod7. So, it doesn't satisfy.

So, perhaps N=7562 isn't a solution.

Therefore, perhaps A=7 is impossible.

So, the next possible A is6.

Set A=6.

Then,

N ≡6*(6-1)=30≡2 mod7.

So, N≡2 mod7.

From other congruences:

2(B-1)≡2 ⇒B-1≡1 ⇒B=2.

3(C-1)≡2 ⇒Multiply by5: C-1≡10≡3 ⇒C=4.

(D-1)≡2 ⇒D=3.

So, N=6 2 4 3=6243.

Check N=6243 mod7.

6243 ÷7=891.857... 7*891=6237, 6243-6237=6. So, 6243≡6 mod7. But according to congruence, N≡2 mod7. Contradiction.

So, N=6243 doesn't work.

Thus, A=6 is impossible.

Proceeding to A=5.

From earlier, when k=3, N=5624≡0 mod7.

Wait, but according to the congruence, when A=5, N≡6*(5-1)=24≡3 mod7.

But 5624 ÷7=803.428... 7*803=5621, 5624-5621=3. So, 5624≡3 mod7, which matches.

Wait, earlier I thought N=5624≡0 mod7, but actually, it's≡3 mod7.

Wait, but according to the congruence, N≡3 mod7.

So, N=5624≡3 mod7.

But when I checked earlier, changing A=5→1 gives1624, which is divisible by7.

Wait, 1624 ÷7=232. So, 7*232=1624. Exactly divisible.

So, N=5624 works.

But when A=5, N≡3 mod7, which is consistent.

So, N=5624 is a valid solution.

But is it the greatest?

Wait, let's see if there's a higher N.

Let me try A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4.

That's N=5624.

Is there a higher N with A=5?

If I increase B to8, keeping other digits as per congruence.

Wait, but earlier, from the equations, B must be2 when A=5.

Because 2(B-1)≡2 mod7 ⇒B=2.

So, B can't be8.

So, the maximum B for A=5 is2.

Thus, N=5624 is the highest when A=5.

But perhaps there's a higher N with A=5, but higher B, C, D.

Wait, but according to the equations, B, C, D are determined uniquely when A=5.

So, N=5624 is the only possible when A=5.

Wait, but perhaps I can try increasing C or D.

Wait, let me see.

From the equations:

When A=5,

N ≡3 mod7.

From the congruences:

B=2,

C=4,

D=3.

So, N=5 2 4 3=5243.

But 5243 is less than5624.

Wait, perhaps I can adjust C and D to get a higher number.

Wait, but according to the equations, when A=5, C=4 and D=3.

So, perhaps N=5624 is the only possible N with A=5.

So, perhaps N=5624 is the greatest four-digit number satisfying the condition.

But wait, earlier, when A=8, I couldn't find a valid N, and when A=7, the N didn't satisfy the congruence.

So, perhaps N=5624 is the answer.

But the problem says "the greatest four-digit positive integer", so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check N=5624 + 1000=6624.

But when A=6, N=6624.

Check changing A=6→1:1624, which is divisible.

Change B=6→1:6124.

6124 ÷7=874.857... 7*874=6118, 6124-6118=6. Not divisible.

So, N=6624 doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps N=5624 is indeed the greatest.

So, N=5624.

Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by1000.

So, 5624 ÷1000=5 with remainder 624.

So, Q=5, R=624.

Thus, Q+R=5+624=629.

So, the answer is629.


The greatest four-digit number \( N \) satisfying the given condition is 5624. Dividing \( N \) by 1000 gives a quotient \( Q = 5 \) and a remainder \( R = 624 \). Therefore, \( Q + R = 5 + 624 = 629 \).

\boxed{629}
