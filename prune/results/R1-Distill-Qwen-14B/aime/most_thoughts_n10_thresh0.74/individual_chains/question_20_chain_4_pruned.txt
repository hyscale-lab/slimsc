Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what it's asking for. 

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinct. I need to place some of them in the 25 cells of the grid. The conditions are:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for all chips in the same column.
3. Additionally, if I try to place any more chips, it would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, I have to figure out how many ways there are to do this.

Hmm, let me break this down. The second condition says that all chips in a row are the same color, and the same for columns. So, for each row, I can choose to place white chips or black chips, but once I choose a color for a row, all the chips in that row must be that color. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but if I fix the colors of all rows and all columns, does that uniquely determine the color of each cell? Because each cell is at the intersection of a row and a column. So, if a row is white and a column is black, what color does the cell take? This seems like a conflict.

Wait, the problem says that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour. So, that implies that for a cell to have a chip, the color must be consistent with both its row and column. Therefore, if a row is white and a column is black, the cell can't have a chip because it can't be both white and black. 

So, the placement of chips must be such that the intersection of a white row and a white column can have a white or black chip? Wait, no, because the cell can only have one color. So, if a row is white and a column is black, the cell cannot have a chip because the color would have to be both.

Alternatively, perhaps the cell can't have a chip if the row and column colors don't match. So, the grid's cells that have chips must lie at the intersections where the row and column colors agree.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose I assign each row a color (white or black) and each column a color (white or black). Then, for a cell to have a chip
