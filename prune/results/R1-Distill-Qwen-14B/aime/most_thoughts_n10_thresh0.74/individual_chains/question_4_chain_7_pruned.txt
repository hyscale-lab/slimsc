Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about how these games work. It's a turn-based game with perfect information, so it's similar to games like Nim. The key is to find the winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where no matter what move you make, you leave the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, a winning position is one where you can force a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L) positions. A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. A position is winning if there's at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

Let's start small and see if we can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't do anything; Alice wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice. So for Bob to win, n must be such that it's a losing position for Alice.

Wait, wait. If n=1, Alice takes it and wins. So Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob. Then Bob can take 1 and win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, but wait, n=2, she can't take 4. So Alice's options are only to take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, so if n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Alice would lose if she can't take the last token. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win if n=2. Wait, no: Wait, n=2: Alice's move. She takes 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't win on n=2, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob.

Wait,
