Alright, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack what this means.

First, the problem defines a positive integer n as b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n must be a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, my task is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. A two-digit number in base b is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero, so a ranges from 1 to b-1, and the second digit c ranges from 0 to b-1.

So, n can be written as n = a * b + c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, right? Wait, is that necessarily true? Well, because a and c are integers, their sum is an integer, so sqrt(n) must be an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. So, n is a perfect square, and sqrt(n) = a + c.

So, putting it together: n = (a + c)^2, and also n = a * b + c.

Therefore, for each base b, we can write the equation:

a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

We need to find all pairs (a, c) where a and c satisfy this equation, given that a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

Let me rearrange the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c.

Let me denote s = a + c. Then, s^2 = a * b + c.

But since s = a + c, we can write c = s - a. Substituting that into the equation:

s^2 = a * b + (s - a)
s^2 = a * b + s - a
s^2 - s = a * (b - 1)

So, s^2 - s = a * (b - 1).

Let me write this as:

a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1).

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c must also be between 0 and b-1, we can think about possible values of s and see what constraints they impose on b.

But wait, since a and c are digits in base b, c must be less than b. So, c = s - a must be less than b. Since a is at least 1, c can be as low as s - (b-1). Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible range of s.

Let's see, s = a + c. a can be from 1 to b-1, c can be from 0 to b-1. So, the minimum s is 1 + 0 = 1, and the maximum s is (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. So, s can range from 1 to 2b - 2.

But s must also satisfy that n = s^2 is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be less than b^2 because in base b, two-digit numbers go up to (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

So, s^2 < b^2 → s < b.

Wait, that's an important point. So, s must be less than b because n = s^2 must be less than b^2. Therefore, s can be from 1 up to b - 1.

So, s ∈ {1, 2, ..., b - 1}.

Okay, so now, let's consider each possible s from 1 to b-1, and see if there exists an a and c such that the
