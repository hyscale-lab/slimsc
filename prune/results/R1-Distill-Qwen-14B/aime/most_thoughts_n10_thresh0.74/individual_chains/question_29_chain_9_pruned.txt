Okay, let's try to solve this geometry problem step by step. So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We're given BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the problem. We have two rectangles. Let me draw rectangle ABCD first. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles. Let's label the vertices in order: A, B, C, D. So, AB is one side, BC is another, etc. Given that AB = 107 and BC = 16, so AB is much longer than BC.

Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, imagine a straight line passing through D, E, C, F. So, D and C are vertices of the first rectangle, and E and F are vertices of the second rectangle, lying on the same line.

Furthermore, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That suggests that the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Given the lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184.

We need to find CE.

Let me think about the properties we can use here. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their sides are perpendicular, and opposite sides are equal. So, in rectangle ABCD, AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184, FG = EH =17.

Wait, EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is the length of the rectangle EFGH, and FG is the width.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, the line DEF is a straight line. So, DE, EC, CF are parts of this line.

Now, since D is a vertex of ABCD, and E is a vertex of EFGH, lying on the same line as D and C, which are also vertices of ABCD. Similarly, F is a vertex of EFGH lying on the same line.

Let me try to sketch the problem mentally. ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 107, BC = 16. So, length AB is horizontal, and BC is vertical. Let me assume that. So, point A is bottom-left, B is bottom-right, C is top-right, D is top-left. Then, the line DC is the top side of the rectangle, from D to C.

Now, points E and F are on the same line as D and C, meaning that the line DC is extended beyond C to point F, and beyond D to point E? Or perhaps in the other direction? Wait, no. Wait, D and C are adjacent vertices, so the line DC is a side of the rectangle. If E and F are on this line, then E and F must lie on DC. But wait, D and C are at the ends. So, maybe E is on the extension beyond D, and F is on the extension beyond C.

Alternatively, perhaps E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. Hmm, but the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order could be D-E-C-F or E-D-C-F, but E and F are vertices of the other rectangle. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is on the extension beyond D, and F is on the extension beyond C, making DC part of the line DEF.

But I think it's better to assign coordinates to each point to make this more precise.

Let's place rectangle ABCD in a coordinate system. Let me assume point D is at (0, 16), since BC = 16. Wait, no, if we are using standard coordinate system, maybe we can place point A at (0, 0). Then, since AB = 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC = 16, so point C would be at (107, 16), and point D would be at (0, 16). So, rectangle ABCD has points A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). Then, the line DC is from (0,16) to (107,16), which is a horizontal line at y=16.

Now, points E and F are on this line. Let me assign coordinates to E and F. Since E and F are vertices of rectangle EFGH, and EFGH is a rectangle, its sides are perpendicular. So, if E is on DC, and F is on DC, then perhaps EFGH is another rectangle attached to DC.

Wait, but rectangles EFGH and ABCD share the line DC with points E and F on it. Hmm.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "D,E,C,F are collinear". So, the order could be D, E, C, F along the line. So, starting from D, moving along the line DC, we pass through E, then C, then F.

So, in coordinates, D is at (0,16), E is somewhere between D and C, which is at (107,16). Wait, but E is a vertex of rectangle EFGH. So, if E is on DC, which is the top side of ABCD, then EFGH must be a rectangle that extends either upwards or downwards from DC.

But if E is between D and C, then EFGH would have to be a rectangle attached to DC. But since E and F are on DC, and EFGH is a rectangle, then the other sides of EFGH would be perpendicular to DC. Since DC is horizontal, the sides would be vertical.

Wait, but rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. EF is 184, FG is 17. So, EF is a longer side, and FG is a shorter side.

If EF is along the line DC, so EF would be from E to F on DC, but wait, E and F are already on DC. So, EF is part of DC. But then FG would have to be perpendicular to EF, so FG would be vertical.

Wait, that can't be because FG is given as 17, which is the same as BC in the other rectangle. Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, but in the problem, FG is 17. So, in rectangle EFGH, FG is a side. So, if EFGH is a rectangle, then EF and FG are adjacent sides. So, if E and F are on DC, which is horizontal, then FG must be vertical. So, from F, which is on DC, FG is a vertical line. So, if FG is 17 units long, then G would be either above or below F.

But since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, let's think about that. Point A is at (0,0), D is at (0,16), H is a vertex of EFGH.

Wait, in rectangle EFGH, the points are
