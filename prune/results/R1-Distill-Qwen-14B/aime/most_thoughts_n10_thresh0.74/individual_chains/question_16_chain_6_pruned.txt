Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I also have to find the least positive integer m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I think I should start by understanding what the problem is asking. It's about primes p where p squared divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. So, I'm looking for primes p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That means when I divide n⁴ + 1 by p², there's no remainder. 

I remember that for primes, we often look at smaller primes first since the least prime is what we're after. So, maybe I can test small primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc., and see if any of them satisfy this condition.

Let me start with p=2. If p=2, then p²=4. I need to find if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's test n=1: 1⁴ +1 = 2, which isn't divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which isn't divisible by 4. Wait, actually, any even n: n=2k, then n⁴ = (2k)⁴ = 16k⁴, so n⁴ +1 = 16k⁴ +1. Adding 1 to a multiple of 16 gives a number that's 1 mod 4, which isn't divisible by 4. Similarly, any odd n: Let’s see, n=1: 1 +1=2 mod 4, which is 2, not 0. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. So, it seems for p=2, there's no n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 is not a candidate.

Next prime is p=3. So p²=9. Let me check if there exists an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. So, n⁴ ≡ 8 mod 9. Let me compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 repeats every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: (4²)²=16²=256 mod9. Let's compute 256/9: 9*28=252, so 256-252=4. So 4 mod9.
n=5: 5²=25, 25²=625. 625 mod9: 9*69=621, so 625-621=4. So 4 mod9.
n=6: 6²=36, 36²=1296. 1296 mod9: 0
n=7: 7²=49, 49 mod9=4, so 4²=16 mod9=7.
n=8: 8²=64 mod9=1, so 1²=1 mod9.

So the residues mod9 for n⁴ are: 1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1.

Looking for 8 mod9, which is equivalent to -1 mod9. But looking at the list, the residues are 1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1. I don't see an 8. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Moving on to p=5. p²=25. So we need n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25, which is 24 mod25.

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24. But that's a lot. Maybe a smarter approach is to consider that in mod5, n⁴ ≡ 0 or 1 mod5 because of Fermat's little theorem. Since 5 is prime, for n not divisible by 5, n⁴ ≡ 1 mod5. So, if n is not divisible by 5, then n⁴ ≡1 mod5. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod5 would imply 1≡-1 mod5, which is 2≡0 mod5, which isn't true. So if n is not divisible by 5, n⁴ can't be ≡-1 mod5. If n is divisible by 5, then n⁴ is 0 mod25, so n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod25, which isn't 0. So, p=5 doesn't work either.

Next prime, p=7. p²=49. So we need n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49. So, let's see if such an n exists. 

First, check if the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod7 has a solution. Because if it doesn't, then mod49 won't either. So in mod7, x⁴ ≡-1 mod7. Since -1 is 6 mod7. 

Compute x⁴ mod7 for x=1 to 6:

x=1: 1⁴=1 mod7
x=2: 16 mod7=2
x=3: 81 mod7=4
x=4: 256 mod7: 256/7=36*7=252, so 256-252=4 mod7
x=5: 625 mod7. 7*89=623, so 625-623=2 mod7
x=6: 1296 mod7: 7*185=1295, so 1296-1295=1 mod7.

So the residues are 1,2,4,4,2,1. None of these are 6 mod7. So x⁴ ≡6 mod7 has no solution. Therefore, p=7 is also out.

Next prime, p=11. Wait, no, let me check p=13, wait, hold on. Wait, I skipped p=11. Wait, what's the order of primes? 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...

Wait, maybe I should check p=17? Hmm, wait, but let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem more systematically.

I remember that for primes p, the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p has a solution only if p ≡1 mod4. Because the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So, -1 is a square if and only if p ≡1 mod4. So, the primes p for which x² ≡-1 modp has a solution are those p ≡1 mod4.

But in our case, we're dealing with x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Hmm, so maybe a similar condition applies but for higher powers.

Wait, so if x⁴ ≡-1 mod p² has a solution, then certainly x² ≡-1 modp must have a solution. So, p must be ≡1 mod4. So, primes like 5,13,17, etc.

Wait, but p=5: we saw earlier that for p=5, n⁴ ≡-1 mod25 doesn't have a solution, so maybe p=13? Let's check p=13.

So, p=13. p²=169. We need to find n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod169.

But before that, let's check mod13. For x⁴ ≡-1 mod13. Since 13≡1 mod4, it's possible that x²≡-1 mod13 has solutions.

Let me check x²≡-1 mod13. So, compute x² mod13:

x=1:1
x=2:4
x=3:9
x=4:16 mod13=3
x=5:25 mod13=12
x=6:36 mod13=10
x=7:49 mod13=10 (since 13*3=39, 49-39=10)
x=8:64 mod13=12 (13*4=52, 64-52=12)
x=9:81 mod13=3 (13*6=78, 81-78=3)
x=10:100 mod13=9 (13*7=91, 100-91=9)
x=11:121 mod13=4 (13*9=117, 121-117=4)
x=12:144 mod13=1 (13*11=143, 144-143=1)

Looking for x²=12 mod13 (since -1 is 12 mod13). Looking at x=5, x²=25=12 mod13. So x=5 and x=8 (since 8²=64=12 mod13). So, 5²=25≡12 mod13, 8²=64≡12 mod13.

So, the solutions to x²≡-1 mod13 are x≡5 and x≡8 mod13.

Now, so if x²≡-1 mod13, then x⁴≡1 mod13, because (x²)^2 = (-1)^2=1. So, x⁴≡1 mod13. But we need x⁴≡-1 mod13²=169. Hmm, how to find such x.

So, perhaps using Hensel's lemma? Because if we have a solution mod p, we can sometimes lift it to a solution mod p².

Hensel's lemma says that if f(x) ≡0 mod p and f'(x) not ≡0 mod p, then there's a unique lift to a solution mod p².

In our case, f(x) = x⁴ +1. We have a solution mod13, namely x=5, which satisfies f(5) =5⁴ +1. Let's compute 5⁴ mod13: 5²=25≡12 mod13, so 5⁴=(5²)²=12²=144≡1 mod13. So, f(5)=1 +1=2≡2 mod13, which is not 0. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, wait, I thought x²≡-1 mod13 implies x⁴≡1 mod13, but I wanted x⁴≡-1 mod13². So, in mod13, x⁴≡1 mod13, but in mod13², does x⁴≡-1 mod169 have a solution?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because if I have x²≡-1 mod13, then x⁴=(x²)^2≡(-1)^2=1 mod13. So, x⁴≡1 mod13, but we need x⁴≡-1 mod169. So, 1 mod13 is 1, and -1 mod169 is 168. So, the difference is 167, which is 13*12 + 11. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, so perhaps I can find x such that x⁴ ≡ -1 mod169. Let me try to find such an x.

Alternatively, since x² ≡-1 mod13, perhaps I can set x=5 +13k, and find k such that x² ≡-1 mod169.

Let me attempt that. Let x =5 +13k. Then, x²= (5 +13k)^2=25 + 2*5*13k + (13k)^2=25 +130k +169k².

We need x² ≡-1 mod169, so x² ≡168 mod169. So, 25 +130k ≡168 mod169.

So, 25 +130k ≡168 mod169. Subtract 25: 130k ≡143 mod169.

Now, 143 mod169 is 143, and 130 mod169 is 130.

So, 130k ≡143 mod169.

We can write this as 130k ≡143 mod169.

We can compute the inverse of 130 mod169.

First, let's find gcd(130,169). 169 ÷130=1 with remainder 39.

130 ÷39=3 with remainder 13.

39 ÷13=3 with remainder 0. So, gcd is13. 

Wait, but 13 divides 130 and 169. 130=10*13, 169=13². So, 13 is the gcd. For the equation 130k ≡143 mod169 to have a solution, 13 must divide 143.

143 ÷13=11, since 13*11=143. So, yes, 143 is divisible by13. So, the equation has solutions.

We can divide the entire equation by13:

130/13=10, 143/13=11, 169/13=13.

So, 10k ≡11 mod13.

Now, find k such that 10k ≡11 mod13.

Compute the inverse of10 mod13. 10 and13 are coprime.

Find x such that 10x≡1 mod13.

10*4=40≡1 mod13 (since 13*3=39, 40-39=1). So, inverse of10 is4.

So, k≡11*4=44≡5 mod13. (44 ÷13=3*13=39, 44-39=5).

So, k=5 +13m.

Thus, x=5 +13k=5 +13*(5 +13m)=5 +65 +169m=70 +169m.

So, x≡70 mod169.

So, x=70 is a solution to x²≡-1 mod169.

Wait, let me check: 70²=4900. What's 4900 mod169?

Compute 169*29=169*(30-1)=5070-169=4901. So, 4900=4901-1=169*29 -1. Therefore, 4900≡-1 mod169. So, yes, 70²≡-1 mod169.

Great, so x=70 is a solution to x²≡-1 mod169. So, x=70 is a square root of -1 mod169.

But we need x⁴≡-1 mod169. Wait, since x²≡-1, then x⁴=(x²)^2≡(-1)^2=1 mod169. Which is 1, not -1. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, so x=70 is a solution to x²≡-1 mod169, but then x⁴=(x²)^2≡1 mod169. So, x⁴≡1 mod169, which is not what we want. We're looking for x⁴≡-1 mod169.

So, perhaps I need to find another approach. Maybe, instead of looking for x²≡-1 mod169, perhaps I need a different starting point.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that x^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2 requires that x^8 ≡1 mod p², which would imply that the order of x modulo p² divides 8. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try to find n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod169. Maybe trying small numbers.

But 169 is 13
