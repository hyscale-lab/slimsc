Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. The paths have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

First, an 8x8 grid. That means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So, moving from the lower left corner to the upper right corner would require moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, but not necessarily in that order. The total number of steps is 16, which makes sense.

Now, the paths change direction exactly four times. So, each time the direction changes, that's when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. I remember that in grid paths, the number of direction changes relates to the number of straight segments or runs in the path.

Wait, let me think. If a path changes direction four times, how many straight segments does that correspond to? Each direction change is when you switch from moving right to up or vice versa. So, starting from the first step, if you change direction once, you have two segments. So, for four direction changes, you must have five segments. That is, four changes lead to five straight parts. So, the path alternates between right and up moves, switching direction four times, leading to five segments.

But wait, the starting direction could be either right or up. So, the path could start with right or start with up. That means there are two cases: starting with right and starting with up. Each case would contribute to the total count.

Now, since the grid is symmetric, maybe the number of paths starting with right and those starting with up are the same. So, I can compute one and double it, maybe. But let's see.

Each path consists of five segments. Let me denote the number of right segments as R and the number of up segments as U. Since we have five segments, either R is 3 and U is 2, or R is 2 and U is 3? Wait, no. Wait, starting with right would mean the number of right segments could be one more than up segments or vice versa, depending on the number of direction changes.

Wait, let's think. If you start with right and change direction four times, how does that affect the counts?

Each direction change alternates the direction. So, starting with right, the first segment is right, then up,
