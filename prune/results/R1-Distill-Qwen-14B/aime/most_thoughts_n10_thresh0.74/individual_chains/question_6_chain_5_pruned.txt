Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations given are:

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)

First, I need to understand the functions involved. The functions f and g are defined as follows:

- \( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{4}| \)

Hmm, these functions look like they're absolute value functions with some transformations. I think I should break down f and g step by step.

Let me start with f(x):

\( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \)

So, first, take the absolute value of x, then subtract 1/2, and then take the absolute value again. Let me think about how this affects the graph of f(x).

The inner absolute value |x| is a V-shaped graph with the vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 would shift this graph down by 1/2 unit. But then taking the absolute value of that would flip any part of the graph that's below the x-axis back up. So, f(x) will have a W-shape or maybe a V-shape with the vertex at (0, 1/2). Wait, let me confirm.

Wait, so |x| is V-shaped. Subtracting 1/2 would make it a V shifted down, so the vertex is at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value after that, the parts where |x| - 1/2 is negative (i.e., for |x| < 1/2) will become positive. So, the function f(x) will have a V shape that's flipped in the region between -1/2 and 1/2.

Let me plot f(x) in my mind:

- For |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So, it's a V-shape starting at (0,1/2), going down to (1/2,0) and (-1/2,0), and then continuing upwards.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, when |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. For |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So, the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that has a minimum at x=0, f(0)=1/2, and then it goes down to 0 at x=1/2 and x=-1/2, and then continues upward beyond that.

So, the graph of f(x) is a diamond shape (like a V on top of another V) with vertices at (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0), and (-1/2, 0). So, it's a tent map kind of function but with a peak at 1/2.

Similarly, let me consider g(x):

\( g(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{4}| \)

Same idea. Start with |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So, |x| is V-shaped, subtract 1/4, so for |x| >= 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4, which is non-negative. For |x| < 1/4, it's 1/4 - |x|. So, the graph of g(x) is a V-shape with a minimum at x=0, y=1/4, and then it goes down to 0 at x=1/4 and x=-1/4, then continues upward beyond that.

So, g(x) has vertices at (0,1/4), (1/4,0), and (-1/4, 0).

Now, the functions inside y and x are compositions of f and g. Let's break down y first.

First, y is given by:

\( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)

So, start with sin(2πx). Let's think about the range of sin(2πx). It's between -1 and 1. Then f is applied to this, so f(sin(2πx)).

Since f takes a value and processes it as per its definition, which for any x, f(x) is between 0 and 1/2. Wait, let's see:

Because |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Let's compute the possible values.

Let me let z = |sin(2πx)|, which is between 0 and 1.

f(z) = | z - 1/2 |.

So, when z is between 0 and 1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - z. So, f(z) is from 1/2 down to 0 as z goes from
