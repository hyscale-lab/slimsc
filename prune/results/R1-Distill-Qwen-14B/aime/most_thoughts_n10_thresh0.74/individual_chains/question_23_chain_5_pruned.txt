Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that's less than BD² for all rhombuses ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that a rhombus has its diagonals perpendicular to each other and bisecting each other. Since their intersection is at the origin, the diagonals are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C, which is opposite to A, should be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D should be symmetric as well. Let me denote point B as (u, v), so point D would be (-u, -v).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. But maybe it's easier to work with the diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes should be -1. Alternatively, in vector terms, if one diagonal is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), and the other is from (u, v) to (-u, -v), then the vectors (x, y) and (u, v) should be perpendicular. So the dot product should be zero: x*u + y*v = 0.

Also, since A and B are points on the hyperbola, both (x, y) and (u, v) must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So:

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1,
u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

Now, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. The length of AC is the distance between (x, y) and (-x, -y), which is sqrt[(2x)² + (2y)²] = 2*sqrt(x² + y²). Similarly, BD is 2*sqrt(u² + v²). Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily equal, but they bisect each other at right angles.

Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular but not necessarily equal unless it's a square. So, the lengths of AC and BD can vary, but they must satisfy the perpendicularity condition.

So, the diagonals are AC and BD, each of length 2*sqrt(x² + y²) and 2*sqrt(u² + v²) respectively. But since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.

Alternatively, since vectors (x, y) and (u, v) are perpendicular, as I thought earlier, their dot product is zero: x*u + y*v = 0.

So, I have these equations:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1,
2. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1,
3. x*u + y*v = 0.

I need to find BD². Wait, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which has length sqrt[(u - (-u))²
