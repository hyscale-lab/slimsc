Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem says that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations to make it clearer. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Both of these are equal to 10, so maybe I can set them equal to each other or find some relationship between x and y.

I remember from logarithm properties that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that to the first equation, log_x(y^x) = 10 means that x^10 = y^x. That's one equation: x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 implies that y^10 = x^{4y}. So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay. So I have x and y related in these exponential equations. I think I can take logarithms of both sides to make the exponents come down, which might help me solve for x and y.

Starting with the first equation: x^10 = y^x.

Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Using the logarithm power rule, this becomes:

10 ln x = x ln y.

So equation (1a): 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Again, applying the power rule:

10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So equation (2a): 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now I have two equations:

1. 10 ln x = x ln y
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's see. Let me denote equation (1a) as equation 1 and equation (2a) as equation 2.

From equation 1: 10 ln x = x ln y. I can solve for ln y in terms of ln x.

Divide both sides by x:

(10/x) ln x = ln y.

So, ln y = (10/x) ln x.

Similarly, from equation 2: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

But I can substitute ln y from equation 1 into equation 2. Let me do that.

Substituting ln y = (10/x) ln x into equation 2:

10 * (10/x) ln x = 4y ln x.

Simplify the left side:

(100/x) ln x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, I notice that ln x appears on both sides, and since x > 1, ln x is positive, so I can safely divide both sides by ln x without worrying about dividing by zero or a negative number.

Dividing both sides by ln x:

100/x = 4y.

So, 100/x = 4y.

Let me solve for y in terms of x.

Multiply both sides by x:

100 = 4y x.

Divide both sides by 4:

25 = y x.

So, xy = 25.

Wait, that's what we're supposed to find! So, is it that simple? Did I just find that xy is 25?

But wait, let's verify if this makes sense. Because sometimes when you manipulate equations, especially with logs and exponents, you might introduce extraneous solutions or make an assumption that isn't valid.

So, let me check if there indeed exist x and y greater than 1 that satisfy the original equations with xy = 25.

If xy = 25, then y = 25/x.

Let me substitute this into the first equation, which is x^10 = y^x.

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Let me write that as x^10 = (25^x)/(x^x).

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Taking the 25th root or something? Maybe express 25 as 5^2, but perhaps taking logarithms again would help.

Take ln of both sides:

(10 + x) ln x = x ln 25.

Hmm, let's write that as:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln 25.

Rearranging:

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x).

Wait, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, let's consider that if I set x = 5, then y = 25/5 =5, so both x and y would be 5.

Let me test x=5, y=5.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125). Since 5^5 is 3125, log base 5 is 5. But the equation says it should be 10. So that's not correct. So x=5, y=5 doesn't work.

Hmm, so perhaps my assumption that xy=25 is correct, but the values of x and y aren't 5. Let me find what x and y could be.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the equations in terms of x and y and find a ratio or something.

Wait, I have from equation 1: 10 ln x = x ln y.

From equation 2: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Let me write these as:

(1) 10 ln x = x ln y

(2) 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Let me call equation (1) as equation A and equation (2) as equation B.

Dividing equation A by equation B:

(10 ln x) / (10 ln y) = (x ln y) / (4y ln x)

Simplify left side: (ln x)/(ln y) = (x ln y)/(4y ln x)

Cross-multiplying:

(ln x)^2 * 4y = (ln y)^2 * x.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.

Alternatively, let's express equation A and equation B in terms of ratios.

From equation A: (ln x)/x = (ln y)/10

From equation B: (ln y)/y = (ln x)/(2.5) because equation B is 10 ln y = 4y ln x => ln y = (4y/10) ln x => ln y = (2y/5) ln x. So (ln y)/y = (2 ln x)/5.

So from equation A: (ln x)/x = (ln y)/10.

And from equation B: (ln y)/y = (2 ln x)/5.

Let me write these as:

(ln x)/x = (ln y)/10 ...(A)

(ln y)/y = (2 ln x)/5 ...(B)

Let me denote a = ln x and b = ln y. Then, equation A becomes a/x = b/10, and equation B becomes b/y = (2a)/5.

But x = e^a and y = e^b, since a = ln x and b = ln y.

So, equation A: a / e^a = b /10.

Equation B: b / e^b = (2a)/5.

So, equation A: a / e^a = b /10 => b = 10 a / e^a.

Equation B: b / e^b = (2a)/5.

Now, substitute b from equation A into equation B:

(10 a / e^a) / e^{(10 a / e^a)} = (2a)/5.

Simplify left side:

(10 a) / [e^a * e^{(10a / e^a)}] = (2a)/5.

Which is:

10a / e^{a + (10a / e^a)} = (2a)/5.

Divide both sides by a (since a = ln x, and x >1, so a >0, so no division by zero):

10 / e^{a + (10a / e^a)} = 2/5.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

10 = (2/5) e^{a + (10a / e^a)}.

Multiply both sides by 5/2:

(10)*(5/2) = e^{a + (10a / e^a)}.

Which simplifies to 25 = e^{a + (10a / e^a)}.

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

ln 25 = a + 10a / e^a.

Factor out a:

ln 25 = a (1 + 10 / e^a).

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can let t = e^a. Since a = ln x, t = x.

So, let t = e^a => a = ln t.

Substitute into equation:

ln 25 = ln t (1 + 10/t).

So,

ln 25 = (ln t) (1 + 10/t).

Hmm, this is an equation in t. Let me write it as:

(ln t) (1 + 10/t) = ln 25.

Let me denote f(t) = (ln t)(1 + 10/t). I can try to solve f(t) = ln25.

I don't know if there's an algebraic solution for t here, so perhaps I can make an intelligent guess or see if t is a nice number.

Let me try t=5. Then:

ln5 (1 + 10/5) = ln5 (1 + 2) = 3 ln5 ≈3 *1.609≈4.828.

ln25 is about 3.218. Hmm, 4.828 is larger than 3.218.

Wait, maybe t=10.

ln10 (1 +10/10)= ln10 *2 ≈2.302*2≈4.604. Still higher than ln25≈3.218.

Wait, t=25:

ln25 (1 +10/25)= ln25*(1 + 0.4)= ln25 *1.4≈3.218*1.4≈4.505. Still too high.

Wait, maybe t= 100?

ln100 (1 +10/100)= ln100*1.1≈4.605*1.1≈5.065. Hmm, even higher.

Wait, what about t=2?

ln2 (1 +10/2)= ln2 *6≈0.693*6≈4.158. Still higher than 3.218.

Hmm, maybe t= something less than 5.

Wait, t= sqrt(25)=5. Wait, I tried that.

Wait, maybe t= 10? Wait, I did t=10, gives 4.604, which is higher than 3.218.

Wait, perhaps t is larger than 25?

Wait, no, when t increases, ln t increases, but 10/t decreases. So, (1+10/t) decreases as t increases. So, is f(t) increasing or decreasing as t increases?

Let me see, for t>0.

Compute f(t) = (ln t)(1 +10/t).

As t increases,
