Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because moving from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid requires 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. The question specifically asks for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, I remember that in grid path problems, especially on a square grid, the number of paths without any restrictions can be calculated using combinations. Since each path consists of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), the total number of paths is C(16,8), which is 12,870. But this problem is more specificâ€”it's about paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction... So, when moving from one step to the next, if the direction changes, that's a turn. So, for example, if you're moving right and then switch to up, that's one direction change. Similarly, up to right is another. So, in a path, each time the direction switches, that's one change.

But the problem says exactly four direction changes. So, how does that translate into the number of runs or sequences of consecutive steps in the same direction?

Right, because each time you change direction, you start a new "run." So, four direction changes would mean that the path has five runs in total. Because each change starts a new run. So, for example, if you start by going right, then up, then right, then up, then right, that's four direction changes and five runs.

So, in this problem, we're dealing with paths that have five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of either right or up moves. Since the grid is 8x8, each run of right moves must be at least 1, and similarly for up moves. But wait, actually, the initial direction could be either right or up. So, the path could start with rights or ups.

So, the problem can be broken down into two cases: paths that start with a right move and those that start with an up move.

Let me think: For each case, the number of runs alternates between right and up. So, if a path starts with right, then the runs alternate as right, up, right, up, etc. Since there are five runs in total, that would mean three right runs and two up runs, or vice versa if it starts with up.

Wait, let's clarify. If the path has exactly five runs, starting with right, the directions would be R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, if starting with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U, which is three U runs and two R runs.

But since the grid is square, 8x8, the total number of rights and ups must each be 8. So, if the path starts with R, the three R runs must add up to 8, and the two U runs must add up to 8. Similarly, if it starts with U, the three U runs must add to 8, and the two R runs must add to 8.

So, for each case, we can model this as the
