Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for primes, especially in number theory problems, it's often useful to consider properties modulo those primes. So, if n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p², that means n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². But before jumping into modulo p², maybe I should think about modulo p first because often the behavior mod p can give hints about mod p².

So, let's start by considering n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, squaring both sides gives n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That suggests that the order of n modulo p divides 8. But also, since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4 or less. Because if the order were 4, then n⁴ ≡ 1 mod p, which contradicts n⁴ ≡ -1. So, the order must be 8. 

But for the multiplicative group modulo p, the order has to divide p-1. So, 8 divides p-1, which implies that p ≡ 1 mod 8. Wait, but p could be 2, right? Let me check that. If p=2, can there be an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4? Let's see, n must be an integer. Let's try n=1: 1+1=2, which isn't divisible by 4. n=2: 16+1=17, which isn't divisible by 4. n=3: 81+1=82, which is 2 mod 4. Hmm, seems like for p=2, n⁴ +1 is always 2 mod 4, so no solution. So p can't be 2.

So, the smallest primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 97,  etc. Wait, actually, let's list primes and see which is the first that is 1 mod 8. The primes start at 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. So, 17 is the first prime that is 1 mod 8 because 17-1=16, which is 2⁴, so yeah. So, maybe p=17 is the prime we're looking for.

But wait, before jumping to conclusions, let me check if p=17 actually satisfies the condition. I need to find an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17²=289. Or at least, n⁴ +1 is divisible by 289.

Alternatively, perhaps p=17 is the minimal prime with this property. But how do I know for sure? Maybe there is a smaller prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n. But as we saw, p=2 doesn't work, p=3? Let me check p=3.

For p=3: Let's see if there's an n with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1 to 8.

n=1: 1⁴=1 → 1 mod 9
n=2: 16 mod 9 is 7
n=3: 81 mod 9=0
n=4: same as 4⁴=256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 → 4 mod9
n=5: 5⁴=625 mod9: 625 - 69*9=625-621=4 → 4 mod9
n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod9=0
n=7:7⁴=2401 mod9: 2401 - 266*9=2401-2394=7 mod9
n=8:8⁴=4096 mod9: 4096 - 455*9=4096-4095=1 mod9.

So, looking for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9 is the same as n⁴ ≡8 mod9.

Looking at the computations:

n=1:1, n=2:7, n=3:0, n=4:4, n=5:4, n=6:0, n=7:7, n=8:1.

None of these are 8 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work.

Next, p=5.

Check if there's n with n⁴≡-1 mod25, which is 24 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24.

But maybe a smarter way is to compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 12, since it's symmetric.

n=1:1

n=2:16

n=3:81 mod25=6

n=4
