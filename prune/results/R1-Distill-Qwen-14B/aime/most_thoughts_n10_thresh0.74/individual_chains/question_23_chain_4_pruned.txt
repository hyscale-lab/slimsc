Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola opening left and right. The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract, but let's try to break it down.

First, let's recall some properties of rhombuses. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles if it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm confused. Let me check: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, and they are perpendicular to each other. Oh, right, yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD
