Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to visualize it first based on the description and the Asymptote figure provided. We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10, and we need to find the length AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.

First, I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a common external point to a circle, those tangents are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB and DC should be equal. That might come in handy later.

The triangle ABC has sides AB =5, BC=9, and AC=10. Let me note that down. So sides are 5,9,10. Let me check if this is a valid triangle. The sum of AB and BC is 14, which is greater than AC=10. Similarly, other combinations should satisfy the triangle inequality, so it's a valid triangle.

Since ABC is inscribed in circle ω, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. I think I might need to compute some properties of triangle ABC, like its circumradius or other angles or sides, but I'm not sure yet.

Point D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. I recall that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. Alternatively, sometimes it's referred to as the exsimilicenter or the external homothety center. But maybe that's more advanced. For now, I can just remember that DB = DC.

Line AD intersects the circumcircle again at point P. So, if I draw a line from A through D, it will intersect the circle ω again at P. So P is diametrically opposite to A? No, not necessarily unless AD is a diameter, which it isn't in this case.

I think I need to find the length AP. Since P is on the circumcircle, perhaps I can use some power of a point theorem or something related to intersecting chords.

Wait, maybe using the Power of a Point theorem for point D with respect to circle ω. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside the circle, the square of the length of the tangent from D to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points of intersection of any secant line through D with the circle.

In this case, DB is a tangent, so DB² = DC² (since DB=DC) equals the power of D with respect to ω. Also, since AD is a secant that passes through D and intersects the circle at A and P, the power of point D should be equal to DA * DP.

So, the power of point D is DB² = DA * DP. Hmm, that seems useful.

So, DB² = DA * DP. That gives DP = DB² / DA. Therefore, if I can find DA and DB, I can find DP, and then since AP = AD + DP (or is it AD - DP?), I need to clarify the positions.

Wait, point D is outside the circle, and line AD passes through the circle, entering at A and exiting at P. So, the order is D, then A, then P. Or is it D, P, A? Let me think.

Since D is outside the circle, and line AD passes through the circle, starting from D, the first intersection is P, then A. Because if you imagine a line from D passing through the circle, it would enter at P and exit at A. Or maybe not? Wait, A is a vertex of the triangle, which is on the circle. So the line AD starts at A, goes through D, but D is outside the circle. So from D, the line goes into the circle, first hitting P, then exiting at A. So the order is D --- P --- A on the line.

Therefore, the length from D to P is DP, and from D to A is DA. So DA = DP + PA. Wait, that can't be because if you have D-P-A on the line, then DA = DP + PA. So PA = DA - DP.

But from the power of point D, we have DB² = DP * DA. So, DP = DB² / DA.

So, PA = DA - (DB² / DA) = (DA² - DB²) / DA.

Therefore, PA = (DA² - DB²) / DA.

So if I can find DA and DB, I can compute PA.

Alternatively, I could compute DA and DB using triangle ABC and point D.

Wait, but how can I find DA
