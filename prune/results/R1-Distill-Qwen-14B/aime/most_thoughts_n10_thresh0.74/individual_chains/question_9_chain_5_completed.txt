Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let's see.

First, I remember that log_a(b^c) is equal to c times log_a(b). Maybe I can use that property here. So let's rewrite both equations using that.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying the power rule, that becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. So, x times log base x of y is 10. I can write that as:

Equation 1: x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, 4y times log base y of x equals 10. Let me write that as:

Equation 2: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I'm trying to solve for x and y, but I have two equations and two variables. Maybe I can express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other or find a relationship between them.

I remember that log_a(b) is equal to 1 / log_b(a). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as something, say, k. Then log_x(y) would be 1/k.

So, let's set k = log_y(x). Then log_x(y) = 1/k.

Now, substituting into the first equation:

Equation 1: x * (1/k) = 10 → x = 10k.

And the second equation is:

Equation 2: 4y * k = 10 → y = 10 / (4k) → y = (5)/(2k).

So now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of k:

x = 10k,

y = 5/(2k).

But I also know that k is log_y(x). Let me write that down:

k = log_y(x) = log_{5/(2k)}(10k).

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can express this logarithm in terms of natural logarithms or something else. Let's see.

log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b), so:

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))].

So, k = ln(10k) / ln(5/(2k)).

This seems a bit tricky, but perhaps I can simplify this equation. Let me write it again:

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))].

Let me denote t = k to make it easier:

t = [ln(10t)] / [ln(5/(2t))].

Hmm, not sure. Maybe cross-multiplying:

t * ln(5/(2t)) = ln(10t).

Let me write that out:

t * [ln(5) - ln(2t)] = ln(10t).

Expanding the left side:

t * ln(5) - t * ln(2t) = ln(10t).

Let me handle each term:

First term: t * ln(5).

Second term: -t * ln(2t) = -t [ln(2) + ln(t)] = -t ln(2) - t ln(t).

So, left side becomes:

t ln(5) - t ln(2) - t ln(t).

Right side: ln(10t) = ln(10) + ln(t).

So, putting it all together:

t ln(5) - t ln(2) - t ln(t) = ln(10) + ln(t).

Let me bring all terms to the left side:

t ln(5) - t ln(2) - t ln(t) - ln(10) - ln(t) = 0.

Factor where possible:

t [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(t)] - [ln(10) + ln(t)] = 0.

Wait, that might not help much. Let me consider grouping terms differently.

Let me factor out the t from the first three terms:

t [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(t)] - ln(10) - ln(t) = 0.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor ln(t) terms.

Looking back at the equation:

t ln(5) - t ln(2) - t ln(t) - ln(10) - ln(t) = 0.

Let me collect like terms:

Terms with ln(t):

(-t ln(t) - ln(t)) = -ln(t)(t + 1).

Terms without ln(t):

t ln(5) - t ln(2) - ln(10).

So, the equation is:

(t ln(5) - t ln(2) - ln(10)) - ln(t)(t + 1) = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor ln(5/2) from the first part. Because ln(5) - ln(2) = ln(5/2).

So, that becomes:

t ln(5/2) - ln(10) - ln(t)(t + 1) = 0.

Hmm, that might be a bit better.

I'm stuck here. Maybe I can try to see if I can express ln(10) as something else. Since 10 is 5*2, ln(10) = ln(5) + ln(2). So,

t ln(5/2) - (ln(5) + ln(2)) - ln(t)(t + 1) = 0.

Alternatively, maybe substitute variables. Let me set u = ln(t). Then t = e^u. Let me see:

Then, the equation becomes:

e^u ln(5/2) - (ln(5) + ln(2)) - u (e^u + 1) = 0.

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe that substitution isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an educated guess for the value of k. Since both x and y are greater than 1, and we're dealing with logs, maybe k is a nice integer or fraction.

Wait, let's think about it. From equation 1, x = 10k, so x is 10 times k. Since x>1, k must be positive. Similarly, from equation 2, y = 5/(2k), so 2k must be less than 5, so k < 2.5. So k is between 0 and 2.5.

Maybe trying k=1. Let's see:

If k=1, then x=10(1)=10, y=5/(2*1)=2.5.

Then, checking the original logs:

First equation: log_x(y^x) = log_10(2.5^10). Let's compute 2.5^10. 2.5^2=6.25, 2.5^4=39.0625, 2.5^5=97.65625, so 2.5^10 is (2.5^5)^2 ≈ (97.65625)^2 ≈ 9536. So log_10(9536) is about 3.98, which is not 10. So k=1 isn't correct.

Hmm, okay, maybe k=2.

k=2: x=10*2=20, y=5/(2*2)=1.25.

Wait, y must be greater than 1. 1.25 is okay.

Check log_x(y^x)=log_20(1.25^20). Hmm, 1.25^20 is a big number. Let's compute log base 20 of that. Let me calculate 1.25^20.

Wait, 1.25^4 = 2.44140625, 1.25^8 ≈ 5.9604644775, 1.25^10 ≈ 9.31322574615, 1.25^20 ≈ (9.31322574615)^2 ≈ 86.726.

So log_20(86.726) = ln(86.726)/ln(20) ≈ (4.462)/(2.9957) ≈ 1.49, not 10. So that doesn't work either.

Hmm, maybe k=0.5.

k=0.5: x=10*0.5=5, y=5/(2*0.5)=5/1=5.

So x=5, y=5.

Check log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) =5. Wait, but the first equation requires this to be 10. So 5≠10. So that's not correct.

Wait, that gives 5, which is half of what we need. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can think of x and y in terms of each other.

Wait, earlier I had k = log_y(x) = ln(x)/ln(y). Since x=10k and y=5/(2k), let me substitute those in.

So, k = ln(10k) / ln(5/(2k)).

Let me compute ln(10k) and ln(5/(2k)).

ln(10k) = ln(10) + ln(k),

ln(5/(2k)) = ln(5) - ln(2k) = ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(k).

So, substituting back, we have:

k = [ln(10) + ln(k)] / [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(k)].

Let me denote A = ln(10), B = ln(5), C = ln(2). So,

k = (A + ln(k)) / (B - C - ln(k)).

Multiply both sides by denominator:

k (B - C - ln(k)) = A + ln(k).

Let me expand:

k(B - C) - k ln(k) = A + ln(k).

Bring all terms to left:

k(B - C) - k ln(k) - A - ln(k) = 0.

Factor terms with ln(k):

- ln(k)(k + 1) + k(B - C) - A = 0.

So,

- (k + 1) ln(k) + k(B - C) - A = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute the numerical values for A, B, C.

A = ln(10) ≈ 2.302585093,

B = ln(5) ≈ 1.609437912,

C = ln(2) ≈ 0.693147181.

So, B - C ≈ 1.609437912 - 0.693147181 ≈ 0.916290731.

So, the equation becomes:

- (k + 1) ln(k) + k * 0.916290731 - 2.302585093 = 0.

Hmm, that's a complicated equation. Maybe I can write this as:

(k + 1) ln(k) = 0.916290731 k - 2.302585093.

I might attempt to solve this numerically. Let's see.

Let me denote f(k) = (k + 1) ln(k) - 0.916290731 k + 2.302585093.

We're looking for k such that f(k)=0.

We can try different values of k between 0 and 2.5 as before.

Let's try k=1:

f(1) = (1+1)*0 -0.916290731*1 + 2.302585093 → 0 -0.91629 +2.302585≈1.3863>0.

k=2:

f(2)=3*ln(2) -0.91629*2 +2.302585≈3*0.6931≈2.0794 -1.83258≈0.2468 +2.302585≈2.5494>0.

Wait, maybe I did that wrong.

Wait, f(k)= (k+1) ln k -0.91629 k +2.302585.

So at k=2:

(2+1) ln(2) ≈3 *0.6931=2.0794,

-0.91629*2≈-1.83258,

+2.302585.

So total f(2)=2.0794 -1.83258 +2.302585≈2.0794+0.4699≈2.5493>0.

Hmm, positive. Let's try k=3:

Wait, but earlier I thought k <2.5, but maybe not? Let me check.

Wait, y=5/(2k). If k=3, y=5/6≈0.8333<1, which is invalid as y must be >1. So k must be less than 5/2=2.5.

So k in (0,2.5). Let's try k=2.5:

f(2.5)=(2.5+1) ln(2.5) -0.91629*2.5 +2.302585.

Compute each term:

3.5 * ln(2.5) ≈3.5 *0.91629≈3.207.

-0.91629*2.5≈-2.2907.

+2.302585.

So total≈3.207 -2.2907 +2.302585≈3.207 +0.011885≈3.2189>0.

Hmm, still positive. What about k=1.5:

f(1.5)= (2.5) ln(1.5) -0.91629 *1.5 +2.302585.

Compute:

2.5 * ln(1.5)≈2.5 *0.4055≈1.01375.

-0.91629 *1.5≈-1.3744.

+2.302585.

Total≈1.01375 -1.3744 +2.302585≈1.01375 +0.928185≈1.9419>0.

Hmm, still positive. Let's try k=0.5:

f(0.5)= (0.5+1) ln(0.5) -0.91629 *0.5 +2.302585.

1.5 * (-0.6931)= -1.03965.

-0.91629*0.5≈-0.4581.

+2.302585.

Total≈-1.03965 -0.4581 +2.302585≈-1.49775 +2.302585≈0.8048>0.

Still positive. Hmm, so f(k) is positive at k=0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5.

Wait, but when k approaches 0, what happens? As k approaches 0 from the right, ln(k) approaches -infinity, so (k+1) ln(k) approaches -infty, but multiplied by k approaching 0, so it's a bit tricky.

Wait, let's check k approaching 0.

Compute f(k) as k approaches 0:

(k+1) ln(k) ~ ln(k) → -infty,

-0.91629 k approaches 0,

+2.302585.

So f(k) approaches -infty, but when k is very small, ln(k) is very negative, but multiplied by (k+1) which is about 1, so f(k) approaches -infty.

But earlier at k=0.5, f(k)≈0.8048>0. So somewhere between k=0 and k=0.5, f(k) crosses from negative to positive. Hmm, but in our case, k must be between 0 and 2.5, but since y=5/(2k) must be greater than 1, k must be less than 5/2=2.5, as we saw.

Wait, but earlier when I tried k=1, 2, etc., f(k) was positive. So perhaps I need to check if f(k) has another root somewhere else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, let's retrace. Starting from:

k = ln(10k) / ln(5/(2k)).

Let me compute both numerator and denominator for some k.

Wait, let's try k= sqrt(10/5) = sqrt(2)≈1.4142. Just a guess.

Wait, trying k= sqrt(2)≈1.4142.

Compute numerator: ln(10 *1.4142)=ln(14.142)≈2.649.

Denominator: ln(5/(2*1.4142))=ln(5/2.8284)=ln(1.7678)≈0.569.

So k≈2.649 /0.569≈4.655, which is much larger than our initial k=1.4142. So that doesn't match. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me set m = ln(k). Then, k = e^m.

So, our equation is:

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))].

Substituting k = e^m:

e^m = [ln(10 e^m)] / [ln(5/(2 e^m))].

Simplify numerator: ln(10 e^m) = ln(10) + ln(e^m) = ln(10) + m.

Denominator: ln(5/(2 e^m)) = ln(5) - ln(2 e^m) = ln(5) - (ln(2) + m).

So:

e^m = [ln(10) + m] / [ln(5) - ln(2) - m].

Multiply both sides by denominator:

e^m [ln(5) - ln(2) - m] = ln(10) + m.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe I can rearrange:

e^m [ln(5) - ln(2) - m] - m - ln(10) = 0.

Still complicated. Maybe I need to use numerical methods here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for t =k.

Wait, I might need to use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the solution.

Let me define f(k)= (k +1) ln(k) -0.91629 k +2.302585.

We can take the derivative f’(k)= ln(k) + (k+1)(1/k) -0.91629.

= ln(k) + 1 + (1/k) -0.91629.

So, f’(k)= ln(k) + (1/k) + 0.08371.

We need to find a root of f(k)=0.

Let me pick an initial guess, say k=2.

f(2)= (3)(0.6931) -0.91629*2 +2.302585≈2.0794 -1.83258 +2.302585≈2.5494.

f’(2)= ln(2) + 0.5 +0.08371≈0.6931 +0.5 +0.08371≈1.2768.

We can use Newton-Raphson:

k1 = k0 - f(k0)/f’(k0).

Let me take k0=2.

f(k0)=2.5494, f’=1.2768.

k1=2 - (2.5494)/1.2768≈2 - 1.996≈0.004.

Wait, that's a big jump. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, because if I compute 2.5494 /1.2768≈2. So 2 -2=0. But that would take k to 0, which is outside our domain.

Hmm, perhaps I need to choose a better initial guess. Let's try k=1.5.

f(1.5)= (2.5)(0.4055) -0.91629*1.5 +2.302585≈1.01375 -1.3744 +2.302585≈1.01375 +0.928185≈1.9419.

f’(1.5)= ln(1.5)≈0.4055 + (1/1.5)≈0.6667 +0.08371≈0.4055+0.6667=1.0722 +0.08371≈1.1559.

So, Newton-Raphson step:

k1=1.5 - (1.9419)/1.1559≈1.5 -1.68≈-0.18.

Which is negative, so invalid. Hmm, maybe I should try a higher k.

Wait, let's try k=3, even though y would be 5/6≈0.833, which is less than 1, but let's see what f(k) is.

f(3)=4*ln(3) -0.91629*3 +2.302585≈4*1.0986≈4.3944 -2.7489≈1.6455 +2.302585≈3.948>0.

f’(3)= ln(3)≈1.0986 + (1/3)≈0.3333 +0.08371≈1.0986 +0.417≈1.5156.

So, k1=3 - (3.948)/1.5156≈3 -2.599≈0.401.

But k=0.401 gives y=5/(2*0.401)≈5/0.802≈6.238, which is okay, but let me compute f(0.401):

f(0.401)= (0.401+1) ln(0.401) -0.91629*0.401 +2.302585.

Compute each term:

1.401 * ln(0.401)≈1.401*(-0.91629)≈-1.283.

-0.91629 *0.401≈-0.3674.

+2.302585.

Total≈-1.283 -0.3674 +2.302585≈-1.6504 +2.302585≈0.6522>0.

Hmm, positive again. Let's try k=0.3.

f(0.3)= (1.3) ln(0.3) -0.91629*0.3 +2.302585.

1.3*(-1.20397)= -1.565.

-0.27489.

+2.302585.

Total≈-1.565 -0.27489 +2.302585≈-1.8399 +2.302585≈0.4627>0.

Hmm, still positive. Let's try k=0.2.

f(0.2)= (1.2) ln(0.2) -0.91629*0.2 +2.302585.

1.2*(-1.6094)=≈-1.9313.

-0.18326.

+2.302585.

Total≈-1.9313 -0.18326 +2.302585≈-2.1145 +2.302585≈0.188>0.

Still positive. Hmm, maybe I need to go lower.

k=0.1:

f(0.1)=1.1*ln(0.1) -0.91629*0.1 +2.302585.

1.1*(-2.302585)≈-2.5328.

-0.091629.

+2.302585.

Total≈-2.5328 -0.091629 +2.302585≈-2.6244 +2.302585≈-0.3218<0.

Okay, so f(0.1)= -0.3218, which is negative.

Earlier, at k=0.2, f=0.188>0.

So, between k=0.1 and k=0.2, f(k) crosses zero.

So, somewhere between 0.1 and 0.2.

Let me try k=0.15.

f(0.15)=1.15 * ln(0.15) -0.91629*0.15 +2.302585.

ln(0.15)≈-1.8971.

1.15*(-1.8971)≈-2.1767.

-0.13744.

+2.302585.

Total≈-2.1767 -0.13744 +2.302585≈-2.3141 +2.302585≈-0.0115<0.

Close to zero. Let's try k=0.16.

f(0.16)=1.16 * ln(0.16)≈1.16*(-1.8326)≈-2.127.

-0.91629*0.16≈-0.1466.

+2.302585.

Total≈-2.127 -0.1466 +2.302585≈-2.2736 +2.302585≈0.02898>0.

So, between k=0.15 and 0.16, f(k) crosses zero.

At k=0.15, f≈-0.0115,

At k=0.16, f≈+0.02898.

So, using linear approximation.

The change in f is 0.02898 - (-0.0115)=0.04048 over delta k=0.01.

We need to find delta such that:

f(k)=0 at k=0.15 + delta*(0.01).

We have f(0.15)=-0.0115,

We need to cover 0.0115 to reach zero.

So delta= 0.0115 / 0.04048≈0.284.

So, k≈0.15 +0.284*0.01≈0.1528.

Let's test k=0.1528.

Compute f(k):

(0.1528 +1) * ln(0.1528) -0.91629 *0.1528 +2.302585.

First, 1.1528 * ln(0.1528).

ln(0.1528)= ln(0.15)≈-1.8971, but more precisely, 0.1528 is 0.15 +0.0028. Let me compute ln(0.1528):

Using Taylor series around 0.15:

ln(0.15 + 0.0028) ≈ ln(0.15) + (0.0028)/0.15.

ln(0.15)= -1.8971,

0.0028/0.15≈0.0187.

So ln(0.1528)= -1.8971 +0.0187≈-1.8784.

So, 1.1528*(-1.8784)≈-2.155.

Next, -0.91629 *0.1528≈-0.1401.

Plus 2.302585.

Total≈-2.155 -0.1401 +2.302585≈-2.2951 +2.302585≈0.0075>0.

Close to zero. Let me try k=0.152.

Compute f(0.152):

1.152 * ln(0.152).

ln(0.152)=?

Again, approximating around 0.15:

ln(0.152)≈ln(0.15) + (0.002)/0.15≈-1.8971 +0.0133≈-1.8838.

So, 1.152*(-1.8838)≈-2.161.

-0.91629*0.152≈-0.1393.

+2.302585.

Total≈-2.161 -0.1393 +2.302585≈-2.3003 +2.302585≈0.0023>0.

Almost zero. Let me try k=0.151.

ln(0.151)= ln(0.15) + (0.001)/0.15≈-1.8971 +0.0067≈-1.8904.

1.151*(-1.8904)≈-2.167.

-0.91629*0.151≈-0.1383.

+2.302585.

Total≈-2.167 -0.1383 +2.302585≈-2.3053 +2.302585≈-0.0027<0.

So, at k=0.151, f≈-0.0027,

At k=0.152, f≈+0.0023.

So, the root is between 0.151 and 0.152.

Using linear approximation:

Between k=0.151 (f=-0.0027) and k=0.152 (f=+0.0023).

Change in f: 0.0023 - (-0.0027)=0.005 over delta k=0.001.

We need to cover 0.0027 to reach zero from k=0.151.

So, delta = (0.0027)/0.005 ≈0.54.

So, k≈0.151 +0.54*0.001≈0.15154.

So, approximately k≈0.1515.

So, k≈0.1515.

Let me compute x and y:

x=10k≈10*0.1515≈1.515.

y=5/(2k)=5/(2*0.1515)=5/0.303≈16.5016.

Wait, so x≈1.515 and y≈16.5016.

Let me check if these satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Compute log_{1.515}(16.5016^{1.515}).

Compute y^x=16.5016^{1.515}.

Compute ln(16.5016)=2.799.

Multiply by 1.515: 2.799 *1.515≈4.242.

Exponentiate: e^{4.242}≈70.5.

So, log_{1.515}(70.5)= ln(70.5)/ln(1.515).

ln(70.5)=4.255,

ln(1.515)=0.415.

So, log≈4.255/0.415≈10.25.

Hmm, close to 10. Considering the approximations, it's acceptable.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Compute x^{4y}=1.515^{4*16.5016}=1.515^{66}.

Compute ln(1.515)=0.415, so ln(x^{4y})=66*0.415≈27.49.

Exponentiate: e^{27.49}≈5.35e11.

So, log_y(5.35e11)= ln(5.35e11)/ln(16.5016).

ln(5.35e11)= ln(5.35)+11 ln(10)=≈1.677 +25.325≈27.

ln(16.5016)=2.799.

So, log≈27/2.799≈9.64≈10, considering the approximations.

Hmm, seems acceptable.

So, with k≈0.1515, x≈1.515, y≈16.5016.

Thus, xy≈1.515 *16.5016≈25.0.

Wait, 1.515 *16.5016≈1.5*16.5=24.75, plus 0.015*16.5≈0.2475, so total≈24.9975≈25.

So, xy≈25.

Hmm, that seems like a nice number. Maybe the exact value is 25.

Let me think if there's an exact solution.

Wait, maybe if xy=25.

Let me assume that xy=25. So, x=25/y.

Let me substitute into the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Which is:

log_{25/y}(y^{25/y})=10.

Hmm, using log_a(b^c)=c log_a(b).

So, this is (25/y) * log_{25/y}(y)=10.

Let me compute log_{25/y}(y).

log_{25/y}(y) = ln(y)/ln(25/y) = ln(y)/(ln(25)-ln(y)).

So, equation becomes:

(25/y) * [ln(y)/(ln(25) - ln(y))] =10.

Let me denote t=ln(y). Then, equation is:

(25/y) * [t / (ln(25) - t)] =10.

But y=e^{t}, so 25/y=25 e^{-t}.

So,

25 e^{-t} * [t / (ln(25) - t)] =10.

Hmm, that's complex, but maybe we can find t such that this equation holds.

Alternatively, maybe let me assume that ln(25/y)=ln(y).

Wait, if ln(25/y)=ln(y), then 25/y=y → y^2=25 → y=5.

Then, x=25/y=5.

So, x=5, y=5.

Wait, but earlier when I tried x=5, y=5, the first equation gave log_5(5^5)=5≠10. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps if I let x= y^{k}, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let me consider the two original equations:

1. log_x(y^x)=10 → x log_x(y)=10 → log_x(y)=10/x.

2. log_y(x^{4y})=10 →4y log_y(x)=10 → log_y(x)=10/(4y).

But log_x(y)=1/log_y(x). So, from first equation, log_x(y)=10/x,

And from second equation, log_y(x)=10/(4y).

So, log_x(y)=1/(log_y(x))= (4y)/10= (2y)/5.

So, 10/x = (2y)/5.

Cross-multiplying: 50=2xy → xy=25.

Ah! So, that's the key.

So, from the first equation, log_x(y) = 10/x.

From the second equation, log_y(x) =10/(4y).

But log_x(y)=1/(log_y(x)) →10/x = 4y/10 → 10/x = (2y)/5.

Cross-multiplying: 50=2xy → xy=25.

So, the product xy=25.

That's the answer. So, I didn't need to go through all that numerical approximation. There was an exact solution path.

I should have thought of this earlier. So, the product is 25.


To solve the problem, we start with the given logarithmic equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

Using the logarithmic identity \(\log_a(b^c) = c \cdot \log_a(b)\), we rewrite the equations as:

1. \(x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10\)
2. \(4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10\)

Let \(k = \log_y(x)\). Then, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{k}\). Substituting these into the equations, we get:

1. \(x \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 10 \implies x = 10k\)
2. \(4y \cdot k = 10 \implies y = \frac{10}{4k} = \frac{5}{2k}\)

Now, we have \(x = 10k\) and \(y = \frac{5}{2k}\). Since \(k = \log_y(x)\), we substitute \(x\) and \(y\) into this expression:

\[
k = \log_{\frac{5}{2k}}(10k)
\]

Using the change of base formula, \(\log_a(b) = \frac{\ln(b)}{\ln(a)}\), we rewrite this as:

\[
k = \frac{\ln(10k)}{\ln\left(\frac{5}{2k}\right)} = \frac{\ln(10k)}{\ln(5) - \ln(2k)}
\]

This equation is complex to solve directly, so we look for an alternative approach. Notice that:

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y}
\]

Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\), we equate:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{4y}{10} \implies \frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
