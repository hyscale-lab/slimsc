Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm. So Alice picks a set A, and then Bob considers all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024, and I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

First, I need to understand what exactly Bob is doing. He's listing all finite non-empty sets B where the max element is in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum, and the other elements are less than a.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think with an example.

Suppose A is {1}. Then the only possible set B is {1}, because any other set would have to have a maximum of 1. So there's only 1 set.

If A is {2}, then the possible sets B are {2}, {1,2}, {2, any smaller number}, but wait, all elements have to be positive integers. So if A is {2}, the possible sets are {2}, {1,2}, {2}, but the elements have to be less than 2? Or any numbers less than 2 can be included?

Wait, no. Because B is a set of positive integers, but for the maximum to be 2, all elements in B must be â‰¤2, and at least one element must be 2.

So, if A is {2}, then the sets B are all non-empty subsets of {1,2} that include 2. How many are those? Well, the number of subsets of {1,2} that include 2 is 2^(2-1) = 2. But wait, the number of non-empty subsets would be 3: {2}, {1,2}, but wait no, wait.

Wait, the total number of subsets of {1,2} is 4: {}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}. The subsets that include 2 are {2}, {1,2}. So that's 2 subsets. But wait, B
