Alright, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, so there are 900 residents in total. Each person owns a bag of candy hearts, which I guess is something everyone has. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 owners respectively. 

The problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four—so that's the candy hearts plus the other three. Hmm, okay, so candy hearts are already included in everyone's ownership, but the other items are optional.

Wait, so let me think about sets here. Each resident can be represented as a set element, and the different items as subsets. So, the total number of residents is the union of all these sets. I remember the principle for the union of multiple sets, but since we have four items, it might get a bit complicated. But wait, candy hearts are universal, so everyone has that. So perhaps, the other three items are the ones that vary.

Let me define the sets:

- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring. So, |D| = 195.
- G for golf clubs: |G| = 367.
- S for spade: |S| = 562.
- C is candy hearts, which is everyone: |C| = 900.

But since C is universal, any intersection involving C is just the other set. So, D ∩ C is just D, and so on. So maybe I can model this as three sets (D, G, S) within the universal set C.

Now, the problem gives me that 437 own exactly two items and 234 own exactly three. But wait, the items include the candy hearts, right? Because each resident must have at least the candy hearts. So when it says they own exactly two, does that include the candy hearts, or not?

Wait, the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So, all residents have the candy hearts. So, when they talk about owning exactly two, that could be two of the other three items (diamond, golf, spade) plus the
