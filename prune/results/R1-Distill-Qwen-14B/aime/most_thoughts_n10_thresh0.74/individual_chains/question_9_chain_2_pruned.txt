Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I'm supposed to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make things clearer. Let me start with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. 

I know that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here, x^10 = y^x. That seems right. So equation one simplifies to x^10 = y^x. Got that.

Now onto the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logarithm rule, this becomes y^10 = x^{4y}. Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, so I have two equations with two variables. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

Looking at equation one, x^10 = y^x. Maybe I can take the x-th root of both sides? That would give y = x^{10/x}. So y is equal to x raised to the power of 10/x. 

Let me write that down: y = x^{10/x}. Now I can substitute this expression for y into equation two.

Equation two is y^10 = x^{4y}. Substituting y with x^{10/x}, I get:

(x^{10/x})^10 = x^{4 * (x^{10/x})}

Simplify the left side first: (x^{10/x})^10 is x^{(10/x)*10} = x^{100/x}.

So the left side is x^{100/x}, and the right side is x^{4 * x^{10/x}}.

Since the bases are the same (both are base x), their exponents must be equal. So:

100/x = 4 * x^{10/x}

Hmm, that gives me an equation in terms of x only. Let me write that:

100/x = 4 * x^{10/x}

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm on both sides to bring the exponents down. Let me try that.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln(100/x) = ln(4 * x^{10/x})

Using logarithm properties, ln(a/b) = ln a - ln b, and ln(ab) = ln a + ln b.

So left side: ln(100) - ln(x)
Right side: ln(4) + ln(x^{10/x}) = ln(4) + (10/x) * ln(x)

So putting it together:

ln(100) - ln(x) = ln(4) + (10/x) ln(x)

Hmm, let's collect like terms. Let me move all terms to the left side:

ln(100) - ln(x) - ln(4) - (10/x) ln(x) = 0

Factor out ln(x):

ln(100) - ln(4) - ln(x) [1 + 10/x] = 0

Hmm, alternatively, maybe I can write this as:

ln(100/4) = ln(x) [1 + 10/x] + ln(x)

Wait, no, let me go back. Maybe I should approach the equation 100/x = 4 x^{10/x} a bit differently.

Let me denote t = 10/x. Then, 100/x = 10*(10/x) = 10t.

And x^{10/x} = x^t. But x can be written as e^{ln x}, so x^t = e^{t ln x}. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can take both sides of 100/x = 4 x^{10/x} and divide by 4 to get:

25/x = x^{10/x}

Hmm, perhaps that's a better form. So 25/x = x^{10/x}.

I can write this as x^{10/x} = 25/x.

Taking natural logs on both sides:

(10/x) ln x = ln(25) - ln(x)

So, (10/x) ln x + ln x = ln(25)

Factor ln x:

ln x (10/x + 1) = ln(25)

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write this as:

ln x = ln(25) / (1 + 10/x )

Simplify the denominator:

1 + 10/x = (x + 10)/x

So,

ln x = ln(25) * (x/(x + 10))

Hmm, so ln x = [x / (x + 10)] * ln 25.

This seems more manageable. Let me set this aside as equation (A):

ln x = [x / (x + 10)] * ln 25.

Hmm, perhaps I can find a substitution or a way to solve for x here. Let me try to rearrange.

Let me denote k = x. So, equation (A) becomes:

ln k = [k / (k + 10)] * ln 25.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange terms:

ln k * (k + 10) = k * ln 25

Which gives:

(k + 10) ln k = k ln 25

Hmm, perhaps moving all terms to one side:

(k + 10) ln k - k ln25 = 0

I can write this as:

k ln k + 10 ln k - k ln25 = 0

Factor k from the first and third terms:

k (ln k - ln25) + 10 ln k = 0

Hmm, ln k - ln25 is ln(k/25), so:

k ln(k/25) + 10 ln k = 0

I'm not sure if this is helpful. Maybe I can factor ln k:

ln k (k /
