Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for all chips in the same column. Additionally, if I try to place any more chips, it would violate these conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, let me understand the constraints better. Each row must be all white or all black, and similarly, each column must be all white or all black. But wait, if each row is monochromatic and each column is monochromatic, then the entire grid must be a checkerboard pattern or something similar, right? Because if a row is all white, then every column that intersects that row must also be all white. But then, if another row is all black, the columns would have to be all black, which would conflict with the previous row's columns. Wait, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, no, actually, each row and each column must be a single color, but different rows can have different colors, and different columns can have different colors. So, for example, row 1 could be all white, row 2 all black, and so on. Similarly, column 1 could be white, column 2 black, etc. But then, the intersections of these colored rows and columns must all be the same color. So, if row i is white and column j is black, then the cell at (i,j) must be both white and black? That can't happen. So there must be some consistency between the row colors and column colors.

Ah, so the only way this can work is if all the rows are the same color or all the columns are the same color. Or maybe another way, like in a checkerboard pattern where the colors alternate. Wait, but in a checkerboard, each row and column alternates between colors, but in that case, each row isn't entirely one color. So that wouldn't satisfy the condition that all chips in the same row have the same color. So, no, a checkerboard doesn't work here.

Wait, so perhaps each row must be entirely white or entirely black, but the color of each row must be compatible with the colors of the columns. So, if a row is white, then every column intersecting it must also be white at that cell. But if another row is black, then the columns intersecting it must be black at that cell. So, how can this happen without conflict?

Let me think. Suppose that all the rows are white. Then, for each column, all the cells in that column must be white. But that's only possible if all the columns are white. So, the entire grid would be all white. Similarly, if all rows are black, then all columns must be black, leading to an all-black grid.

Alternatively, suppose not all rows are the same color. Let's say that some rows are white and some are black. Then, for each column, all the cells in that column must be the same color. But a column can't have both white and black cells if all its cells must be the same color. So, if a column intersects a white row, then that column must be white at that cell, but if another row intersecting the same column is black, that would require the column to be black there. This is a contradiction.

So, the only way this works is if all the rows are white, which then forces all columns to be white, or all the rows are black, forcing all columns to be black. Alternatively, the opposite could happen: all columns are white, forcing all rows to be white, or all columns are black, forcing all rows to be black.

Wait, but that can't be right because then the only possible configurations would be all white or all black. But that seems too restrictive. Because the problem says "some of these chips", which implies that not all 25 white and 25 black chips are used. Wait, no, the total number of chips is up to 50, but each cell can only hold one, so the maximum is 25 since it's
