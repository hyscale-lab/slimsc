Okay, let me try to figure out this probability problem. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, so this seems like a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize and B is the event of winning a prize.

In this case, winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize because if she wins the grand prize, she definitely has at least two numbers matching. So, P(A and B) is just P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. And P(B) is the probability of winning a prize, which includes both the grand prize and the case where exactly two or exactly three numbers match.

So, I need to calculate P(A) and P(B), then compute P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4), which is 210.

So, the denominator for both probabilities will be 210.

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. That happens when all four of her numbers are chosen. Since she picks 4 specific numbers, there's only one way this can happen. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, let's compute P(B), which is the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, this includes the cases where exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers match. 

Wait, but we've already considered that exactly 4 is the grand prize. So, the number of favorable outcomes for P(B) is the sum of the number of ways to choose exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 numbers that match her chosen numbers.

Let me break this down. Let's denote her chosen numbers as a set of 4, say K = {k1, k2, k3, k4}. The randomly chosen 4 numbers can have 2, 3, or 4 numbers in common with K.

For exactly 2 matches: We need to choose 2 numbers from K and 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers not in K. The number of ways is C(4,2) * C(6,2).

Similarly, for exactly 3 matches: Choose 3 from K and 1 from the remaining 6, so C(4,3) * C(6,1).

For exactly 4 matches: As before, it's C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for P(B) is [C(4,2)*C(6,2)] + [C(4,3)*C(6,1)] + [C(4,4)*C(6,0)].

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15, so 6*15=90.

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24.

C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1, so 1*1=1.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for P(B) is 115. Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm this calculation because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in combinatorics.

So, the total number of ways is 210. The number of ways to choose exactly 2 is 90, exactly 3 is 24, exactly 4 is 1. So, 90+24+1=115. That seems correct.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 115 รท 5 = 23, 210 รท5=42. So, P(B)=23/42.

Wait, but 23 and 42 are coprime? 23 is a prime number, and 42 is 2*3*7. No common factors, so yes, 23/42 is the simplified form.

But wait, wait. Because the total number of possible outcomes is 210, and the number of winning outcomes is 115, so 115/210 is 23/42.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, no, actually, wait. Because in probability, P(A) is the probability of all four matching, which is 1/210. But wait, no, hold on. Wait, the denominator is the same for both P(A) and P(B), which is the total number of possible combinations, which is 210.

But when we compute the conditional probability, we are considering the probability within the scenario where she has won a prize. So, the conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B). So, substituting the values:

P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1 / 115.

Wait, so that would make the probability 1/115. But wait, 1 and 115 are coprime, so m=1, n=115, so m + n=116.

But wait, let me think again. Is the conditional probability correctly calculated?

Wait, in conditional probability, P(A|B) is the probability that A occurs given that B has occurred. So, in this case, if B is the event of winning a prize (which includes all cases where she has 2, 3, or 4 matches), then the number of possible outcomes where B occurs is 115. Out of these, only 1 outcome is the grand prize (all 4 matches). So, the conditional probability is 1 / 115.

Hmm, that seems correct. So, m is 1 and n is 115, which are coprime, so m + n is 116.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier. Let me think about the counts again.
