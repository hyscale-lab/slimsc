Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's start by visualizing the hexagon. Since it's equilateral, all its sides are equal, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles can vary. Also, all opposite sides are parallel, which suggests it's a type of hexagon called a "zonogon." I remember that in such hexagons, opposite sides are equal and parallel, which fits the given conditions.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF must be related to the hexagon's structure. Let me try to imagine this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, these three lines meet to form a triangle. Wait, AB and CD are opposite sides, so their extensions might meet at some point, forming a triangle with the other extended side EF.

Since the hexagon is convex, the triangle formed by these extensions must be larger than the hexagon itself. I think the triangle might be similar to the hexagon's structure but scaled up.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s.

Now, the triangle's sides are 200, 240, and 300. That's a 3:4:5 triangle scaled up by a factor of 40 (since 3*40=120, 4*40=160, 5*40=200 – wait, no, 200,240,300 is 200=200, 240=200*1.2, 300=200*1.5, so not a multiple of 3:4:5. Wait, 200:240:300 simplifies by dividing by 20, giving 10:12:15, which is 5:6:7.5. Not a Pythagorean triple, so maybe it's just a scalene triangle.

But maybe it's a right triangle? Let's check: 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300² is 90000. Not equal, so it's not a right triangle.

Not sure if that matters. Maybe I should think about how the triangle relates to the hexagon.

Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be seen as a translation of smaller equilateral parts along the directions of these sides. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the triangle is formed by the external extensions, and the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle.

Wait, another approach: in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, you can think of it as being formed by two similar triangles connected by parallelograms. But wait, the triangle formed by the extensions is given, so maybe the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon can be considered as a combination of a smaller similar triangle and three parallelograms. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF would then be similar to the inner triangle, but scaled.

Let me try to model this.

Let’s denote the triangle formed by AB, CD, EF extensions as triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. The hexagon is inscribed in such a way that each pair of opposite sides is parallel to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, but the hexagon has six sides, each of length 's'. So, maybe each side of triangle T is divided into segments by the points where the hexagon's sides meet.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the triangle is divided into smaller similar triangles at each corner, each similar to T.

Wait, that might
