Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the given conditions:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that it's symmetric in a, b, c. That is, swapping any two variables doesn't change the equation. So maybe there's a way to simplify it or factor it somehow.

Let me try to factor the expression. Let's see:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

I can factor terms pairwise:

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

But since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the expression:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which simplifies to:

= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So, the second equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a bit simpler, but still a bit messy. Maybe I can factor this expression differently.

Wait, let me consider the entire expression 300a² - a³. That can be written as a²(300 - a). Similarly for the other terms.

So, the equation is:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

I wonder if there's a way to relate this to the first equation, which is a + b + c = 300.

Another thought: maybe I can express this in terms of some symmetric sums or use variables substitution.

Wait, perhaps if I let x = a, y = b, z = c, then the equations are:

x + y + z = 300

and

x²y + x²z + y²x + y²z + z²x + z²y = 6,000,000

Wait, another approach: maybe factor the second equation using the first equation.

We know that a + b + c = 300, so perhaps we can relate the second equation to (a + b + c)(something).

Wait, let me think about the second equation. Let's factor the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

But since b + c = 300 - a, as before.

So, substituting:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c
