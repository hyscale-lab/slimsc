Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have two equations:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

And I need to find the number of intersections of their graphs. Hmm, intersections mean points (x, y) that satisfy both equations. So, I need to find all pairs (x, y) such that both equations are true.

First, let me understand what f and g are. The functions are defined as:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

So, both f and g are absolute value functions with some transformations. Maybe I should sketch them or understand their behavior.

Starting with f(x):

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|

The inner part |x| is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, it will reflect any negative parts back up.

So, let's think about f(x):

When |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So f(x) is a V-shaped function that has a V at |x| = 1/2, going upwards on both sides beyond that and downwards in between.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Same idea: |x| is the base V. Subtract 1/4, so when |x| >= 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4, else 1/4 - |x|.

So g(x) also has a V-shape with vertices at |x|=1/4.

Now, considering f and g, let's see what their compositions look like. The functions are nested, so first, I might need to look at f(sin(2πx)) and then g of that.

But perhaps it's better to think about the range of the inner functions.

First, let's analyze f(sin(2πx)).

Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1. So |sin(2πx)| ranges between 0 and 1.

So the input to f is in [0,1].

Now, f(z) where z is between 0 and 1.

Let me evaluate f(z):

f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|.

But since z is between 0 and 1, |z| = z.

So f(z) = | z - 1/2 |.

Similarly, for z in [0,1], f(z) is a V-shape with the vertex at z=1/2.

So f(z) goes from 1/2 at z=0, decreases to 0 at z=1/2, then increases back to 1/2 at z=1.

So f(z) for z in [0,1] is a triangle wave between 0 and 1, peaking at z=0 and z=1 with value 1/2, and minimum at z=1/2 with value 0.

So f(sin(2πx)) will take sin(2πx), which oscillates between -1 and 1, take its absolute value, then apply f(z) as above.

Wait, but sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. So sin(2πx) has a period of 1. Similarly, cos(3πy) will have a period related to 2/3.

But maybe I should first figure out the range of f(sin(2πx)).

Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then f(z) as above is between 0 and 1/2.

So f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2].

Similarly, when we apply g to that, which is g(w) where w is in [0, 1/2].

So let's compute g(w):

g(w) = ||w| - 1/4|.

Since w is between 0 and 1/2, |w| = w.

So g(w) = |w - 1/4|.

So, for w in [0, 1/2], this is another V-shape function.

At w=0: g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4.

At w=1/4: g(1/4) = 0.

At w=1/2: g(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4.

So g(w) is a V-shape that goes from 1/4 at w=0, down to 0 at w=1/4, then back up to 1/4 at w=1/2.

So, in total, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) becomes:

y = 4 * [ | | f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4 | ]

But wait, f(sin(2πx)) is in [0, 1/2], so when we subtract 1/4, in some regions it's positive, others negative.

Wait, but when we have g(f(...)), which is g(w), which is |w - 1/4|, so when w is in [0,1/2], then w - 1/4 is negative when w < 1/4, and positive when w > 1/4.

So:

g(w) = 1/4 - w when w ≤ 1/4,

and g(w) = w - 1/4 when w > 1/4.

So, when f(sin(2πx)) ≤ 1/4, g(f(...)) = 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)).

And when f(sin(2πx)) > 1/4, g(f(...)) = f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4.

But f(sin(2πx)) is | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |, which we can denote as f(z) where z = |sin(2πx)|.

So, f(z) is | z - 1/2 |.

So f(z) can be written as:

f(z) = 1/2 - z when z ≤ 1/2,

and f(z) = z - 1/2 when z > 1/2.

But since z is |sin(2πx)|, which is between 0 and 1, f(z) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

So, for f(z) ≤ 1/4, which is when |z - 1/2| ≤ 1/4.

Wait, let me think.

Wait, f(z) = |z - 1/2|.

So f(z) ≤ 1/4 implies that |z - 1/2| ≤ 1/4.

Which implies that 1/2 - 1/4 ≤ z ≤ 1/2 + 1/4.

Which is 1/4 ≤ z ≤ 3/4.

But z is |sin(2πx)|, which is between 0 and 1.

So, f(z) ≤ 1/4 when |sin(2πx)| is between 1/4 and 3/4.

Similarly, f(z) > 1/4 when |sin(2πx)| is less than 1/4
