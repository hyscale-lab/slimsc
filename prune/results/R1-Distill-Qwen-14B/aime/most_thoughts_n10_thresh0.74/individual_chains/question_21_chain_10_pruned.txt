Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the definition: A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 is 63 in base 13, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). Got it.

So, I need to find the least b where there are more than ten such numbers. That means I need to find the smallest b such that there are at least eleven b-eautiful integers n.

Let me break down the problem.

First, understanding what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero; otherwise, it would be a single-digit number. So, a must be at least 1. Also, both a and c must be less than b because in base b, digits go from 0 to b-1.

So, any two-digit number in base b is n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. Squaring both sides, n = (a + c)^2.

So, putting it together, we have:

n = a*b + c = (a + c)^2

So, the equation is a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me rearrange this equation to see if I can find a relationship between a, c, and b.

Expanding the right side: (a + c)^2 = a² + 2ac + c².

So, setting that equal to a*b + c:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor terms with a and c:

a² + (2c - b)*a + (c² - c) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So, for given c and b, I can solve for a.

But since a and c are digits in base b, their possible values are limited. So maybe I can express this differently.

Alternatively, let's think about the equation:

n = a*b + c = (a + c)^2

So, n must be a perfect square since it's equal to (a + c)^2.

Let me define s = a + c. Then, n = s².

Also, n = a*b + c. So, s² = a*b + c.

But since s = a + c, we can express c as s - a.

Substituting into the equation:

s² = a*b + (s - a)

Simplify:

s² = a*b + s - a

Let me rearrange terms:

s² - s = a*b - a

Factor a on the right:

s² - s = a*(b - 1)

So, a = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Since a must be a positive integer (as it's a digit in the two-digit number, so 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1), the numerator (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b - 1) must divide (s² - s).

But wait, s = a + c, and since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, s can range from 1 (if a=1, c=0) up to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2 (if a and c are both maximum digits). Hmm, but s = a + c, and n = s². So, n must also be at least 1 (since 1 is the smallest two-digit number in base b: 10_b = b, which is larger than 1). Wait, actually, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b, which is greater than or equal to 2. But n is s², so n must be a perfect square greater than or equal to b.

Wait, but in the
