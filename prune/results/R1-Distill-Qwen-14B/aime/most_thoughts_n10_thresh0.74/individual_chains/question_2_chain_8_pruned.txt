Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). They form a triangle, I think. Then there's this family F of segments PQ, each of length 1, lying in the first quadrant. Each PQ has point P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. 

The task is to find a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. Then compute OC squared, express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis. The segment AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute AB's equation.

First, AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB would be (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Let's see, when x=0, y = sqrt(3)/2, which matches point B. So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, lying in the first quadrant. So each PQ is a line segment from some point (p,0) to (0,q), with p and q positive, and the length of PQ is 1. So for each PQ in F, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So p² + q² = 1.

Therefore, for each (p, q) in the first quadrant with p² + q² =1, the line segment PQ connects (p,0) to (0,q). So the family F is all such segments.

Now, the point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and it's the unique point that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of the segments in F, right? Because AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if AB has length 1.

Compute the distance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, so AB is in F.

So, point C is on AB, and the only segment in F that contains C is AB itself. So, C is such that no other PQ in F passes through it.

I need to find such a point C. Then compute OC squared.

So, perhaps I can parametrize AB and find a point C on AB which is not on any other PQ in F.

Let me parametrize AB. Let me write AB in parametric form. Let's say a parameter t goes from 0 to 1, where t=0 is at A, and t=1 is at B.

So, starting at A: (1/2, 0). The vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, parametric equations: x = 1/2 - (1/2)t, y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t, for t in [0,1].

So, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)t). Now, I need to find t such that C doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB.

Alternatively, for any other PQ in F, the line PQ should not pass through C. So perhaps, for each such PQ, the line PQ can be expressed as x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q²=1.

Wait, because for a segment PQ from (p,0) to (0,q), the equation of the line is x/p + y/q =1.

So, for the point C=(x,y) on AB, we need that x/p + y/q =1 only when PQ is AB itself. For all other (p,q) with p² + q²=1, x/p + y/q ≠1.

So, if I can find (x,y) on AB such that for all other (p,q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant, x/p + y/q ≠1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the envelope of all such lines PQ, and find the point C where the envelope touches AB. Because the envelope would be the boundary of the region covered by all these lines, so points on AB inside the envelope would lie on multiple PQs, and the point where AB is tangent to the envelope would be the unique point C that only lies on AB and no other PQ.

So, the envelope of the family F of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p² + q²=1.

I think the envelope can be found by solving for p and q the system:

x/p + y/q = 1,

and the derivative condition: d/dp (x/p + y/q) = 0 and d/dq (x/p + y/q) = 0. Wait, no, for the envelope, we need to solve the equation F(p,q,x,y)=0 and dF/dλ=0, where λ is a parameter. But in this case, the parameter is p and q, but subject to the constraint p² + q²=1.

Hmm, maybe it's better to use the standard method for finding the envelope of a family of curves depending on a parameter. But in our case, the family is parameterized by p (since q = sqrt(1 - p²)), so we can write the line equation as x/p + y*sqrt(1 - p²) =1.

Let me write F(p, x, y) = x/p + y*sqrt(1 - p²) -1 =0.

The envelope is found by solving F=0 and dF/dp=0.

Compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = -x/p² + y*( (-2p)/(2 sqrt(1 - p²)) ) = -x/p² - y*p/sqrt(1 - p²).

Set this equal to zero:

-x/p² - y*p/sqrt(1 - p²) =0.

Multiply both sides by p² sqrt(1 - p²):

- x sqrt(1 - p²) - y p³ =0.

So, x sqrt(1 - p²) + y p³=0.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can express this in terms of x and y.

But we also have from F=0:

x/p + y sqrt(1 - p²) =1.

So, we have two equations:

1) x/p + y sqrt(1 - p²) =1,

2) x sqrt(1 - p²) + y p³ =0.

Let me denote s = sqrt(1 - p²), so s = sqrt(1 - p²) → s²=1 - p².

Then equation 1 becomes x/p + y s =1,

and equation 2 becomes x s + y p³ =0.

So, equation 2: x s = - y p³.

Substitute x s into equation 1:

From equation 2: x s = - y p³ → x = (- y p³)/s.

Substitute into equation1:

(- y p³)/(s p) + y s =1 → (- y p²)/s + y s =1.

Factor out y:

y [ (-p²)/s + s ] =1.

Compute the term in brackets:

(-p²)/s + s = (-p² + s²)/s.

But s²=1 - p², so:

(-p² +1 - p²)/s = (1 - 2p²)/s.

So equation becomes:

y * (1 - 2p²)/s =1.

So,

y = s / (1 - 2p²).

But s = sqrt(1 - p²) → y = sqrt(1 - p²)/(1 - 2p²).

Hmm, that's an expression for y in terms of p.

Now, let's see if we can relate x and y.

From equation 2: x s = - y p³.

We have y in terms of p, so:

x s = - [ sqrt(1 - p²)/(1 - 2p²) ] * p³.

But s = sqrt(1 - p²), so:

x sqrt(1 - p²) = - [ (1 - p²) / (1 - 2p²) ] p³.

Divide both sides by sqrt(1 - p²):

x = - [ (1 - p²) / (1 - 2p²) ] p³ / sqrt(1 - p²).

Simplify numerator: (1 - p²) = s², so sqrt(1 - p²) = s.

So,

x = - [ s² / (1 - 2p²) ] p³ / s = - [ s p³ ] / (1 - 2p²).

But s = sqrt(1 - p²), so:

x = - [ p³ sqrt(1 - p²) ] / (1 - 2p²).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can express p in terms of some angle.

Let’s consider p = cos θ, then sqrt(1 - p²) = sin θ.

So, p = cos θ, s = sin θ.

Then, the expression for y becomes:

y = sin θ / (1 - 2 cos² θ).

And for x:

x = - [ cos³ θ sin θ ] / (1 - 2 cos² θ).

Simplify denominator: 1 - 2 cos² θ = - (2 cos² θ -1 ) = - cos(2θ), since cos(2θ)= 2 cos² θ -1.

So, denominator is -cos(2θ).

Similarly, numerator for x: cos³ θ sin θ.

So,

x = - [ cos³ θ sin θ ] / (- cos(2θ)) = [ cos³ θ sin θ ] / cos(2θ).

Similarly, y = sin θ / (- cos(2θ)) = - sin θ / cos(2θ).

Let me express x and y in terms of θ:

x = (cos³ θ sin θ) / cos(2θ),

y = - sin θ / cos(2θ).

Hmm, perhaps using trigonometric identities can help.

We can note that 1/cos(2θ) = sec(2θ), and express x in terms of multiple angles.

Alternatively, maybe express in terms of tan θ.

Let’s set t = tan θ. Then, cos θ = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²), sin θ = t / sqrt(1 + t²).

Then, cos(2θ) = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²).

Compute x:

x = [ ( (1 / sqrt(1 + t²))³ ) * (t / sqrt(1 + t²)) ] / [ (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) ) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1 / (1 + t²)^(3/2)) * (t / sqrt(1 + t²)) ) = t / (1 + t²)^2.

Denominator: (1 - t²)/(1 + t²).

So, x = [ t / (1 + t²)^2 ] / [ (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) ) ] = t / (1 + t²)^2 * (1 + t²)/(1 - t²) ) = t / [ (1 + t²)(1 - t²) ) ] = t / (1 - t^4).

Similarly, y = - [ t / sqrt(1 + t²) ] / [ (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) ) ].

Simplify:

y = - [ t / sqrt(1 + t²) ] * [ (1 + t²)/(1 - t²) ) ] = -t sqrt(1 + t²) / (1 - t²).

Hmm, so x = t / (1 - t^4) and y = -t sqrt(1 + t²) / (1 - t²).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about parametric equations for the envelope.

Alternatively, maybe I can eliminate θ from the parametrization of x and y.

We have x = cos³ θ sin θ / cos(2θ),

and y = - sin θ / cos(2θ).

Let me try to express x in terms of y.

From y = - sin θ / cos(2θ),

Let me write cos(2θ) = (1 - 2 sin² θ).

Wait, cos(2θ) = 1 - 2 sin² θ. Hmm, but in the denominator, so maybe express sin θ in terms of y and cos(2θ).

From y = - sin θ / cos(2θ) → sin θ = - y cos(2θ).

Then, x = [ cos³ θ sin θ ] / cos(2θ) = [ cos³ θ (- y cos(2θ)) ] / cos(2θ) ) = - y cos³ θ.

So, x = - y cos³ θ.

But cos(2θ) = 1 - 2 sin² θ, and since sin θ = - y cos(2θ), we can write:

cos(2θ) = 1 - 2 [ (- y cos(2θ)) ]².

Wait, maybe substituting cos(2θ) in terms of y.

Let me denote c = cos(2θ). Then,

sin θ = - y c,

and cos(2θ) = c.

We also have the identity sin² θ + cos² θ = 1.

But sin θ = - y c, so sin² θ = y² c².

Also, cos(2θ) = 2 cos² θ -1 → c = 2 cos² θ -1 → cos² θ = (c +1)/2.

So, sin² θ + cos² θ = y² c² + (c +1)/2 = 1.

So,

y² c² + (c +1)/2 = 1.

Multiply both sides by 2:

2 y² c² + c +1 = 2.

Simplify:

2 y² c² + c -1 =0.

So, this is a quadratic equation in c.

But from above, we have x = - y cos³ θ.

We can express cos³ θ in terms of c.

cos(2θ) = c = 2 cos² θ -1 → cos² θ = (c +1)/2 → cos θ = sqrt( (c +1)/2 ).

So, cos³ θ = [ (c +1)/2 ]^(3/2).

But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express c in terms of y from the quadratic equation.

From 2 y² c² + c -1=0,

We can solve for c:

c = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 + 8 y²) ] / (4 y²).

But since cos(2θ) can be positive or negative, but in our case, θ is such that p=cos θ is in the first quadrant, so θ is between 0 and π/2, so 2θ is between 0 and π, so cos(2θ) can be positive or negative.

Wait, but in our parametrization, p=cos θ, which is positive because p is in the first quadrant.

Wait, but when θ approaches π/2, cos θ approaches 0, which is still positive. So θ is between 0 and π/2, so 2θ is between 0 and π, so cos(2θ) can be positive (for θ < π/4) or negative (for θ > π/4). So c can be positive or negative.

Hmm, but in our case, the envelope could have two branches. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the point C lying on AB and also on the envelope of the family F. So, point C is the intersection of AB and the envelope.

So, AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

And the envelope is given by the parametric equations x and y in terms of θ, as above.

So, to find the intersection, we can set the parametric equations equal to the line AB.

So, substitute x and y into AB's equation:

y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

From the envelope:

y = - sin θ / cos(2θ),

and x = cos³ θ sin θ / cos(2θ).

So, substituting into AB's equation:

- sin θ / cos(2θ) = -sqrt(3) [ cos³ θ sin θ / cos(2θ) ] + sqrt(3)/2.

Multiply both sides by cos(2θ):

- sin θ = -sqrt(3) cos³ θ sin θ + sqrt(3)/2 cos(2θ).

Bring all terms to one side:

- sin θ + sqrt(3) cos³ θ sin θ - sqrt(3)/2 cos(2θ) =0.

Factor sin θ:

sin θ ( -1 + sqrt(3) cos³ θ ) - sqrt(3)/2 cos(2θ) =0.

This seems complicated. Maybe using substitution t = θ.

Alternatively, perhaps let me factor cos(2θ):

Wait, cos(2θ) = 2 cos² θ -1.

Hmm, perhaps express everything in terms of cos θ.

Let me set u = cos θ. Then, sin θ = sqrt(1 - u²).

But I think this might not simplify things much. Alternatively, perhaps try to find a specific θ that satisfies this equation.

Wait, maybe there's a θ where the equations intersect, meaning that C is the point where the envelope touches AB. So perhaps, we can find such a θ.

Alternatively, maybe this is getting too involved. Let me think differently.

The family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p² + q²=1. Each such line is a tangent to the ellipse x² + y² =1/(something), but wait, no, the envelope might be another curve.

Wait, the envelope of x/p + y/q =1 with p² + q²=1 is actually the astroid given by x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1. Let me check this.

Wait, the general equation for the envelope of lines (x/p) + (y/q)=1 with p² + q² = a² is an astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = a^{2/3}.

In our case, a=1, so the envelope is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

So, the astroid touches each line in F exactly once. So, the point C is where the astroid and AB are tangent to each other.

So, to find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.

AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

The astroid is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

So, I need to find the point (x,y) on both AB and the astroid, and the tangent lines to both curves at that point are the same.

So, first, substitute y from AB into the astroid equation.

So,

x^{2/3} + [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^{2/3} =1.

Let me compute that:

Let me write y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So,

y = sqrt(3)( -x + 1/2 ).

So, y = sqrt(3)( (1/2) - x ).

So,

y^{2/3} = [ sqrt(3)( (1/2) - x ) ]^{2/3 }= [ 3^{1/2} (1/2 -x) ]^{2/3 }= 3^{1/3} (1/2 -x)^{2/3}.

So, the astroid equation becomes:

x^{2/3} + 3^{1/3} (1/2 -x)^{2/3} =1.

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe we
