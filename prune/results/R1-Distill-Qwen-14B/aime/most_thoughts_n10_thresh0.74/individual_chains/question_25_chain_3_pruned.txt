Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll list out the given information:

- Total residents: 900
- Number of residents owning a diamond ring (let's denote this as D) = 195
- Number owning golf clubs (G) = 367
- Number owning garden spade (S) = 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H). So, H is 900.

Wait, but H is mentioned as something everyone owns, so the count for H is 900. That might simplify things a bit because we don't have to worry about people not owning H; everyone has it.

Next, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the total number of people owning exactly two items is 437, and exactly three is 234.

We need to find the number of people who own all four items. Let's denote that as x. So, our target is x.

Since all four items are involved, I might need to use the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let me recall.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets says that the total number of elements in the union of four sets is equal to the sum of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the four-way intersection. But in this problem, I'm not directly given the union, but perhaps I can use other information.

Wait, but actually, since every resident owns at least H, which is 900, the total number of residents is 900. So, the union of all four sets (D, G, S, H) is 900. Because everyone owns H, no one is outside the union.

So, the formula for the union of four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ H| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩H| - |G∩S| - |G∩H| - |S∩H| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩H| + |D∩S∩H| + |G∩S∩H| - |D∩G∩S∩H|

But since |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ H| is 900, and |H| is 900, this equation simplifies a bit. Let's write that out.

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - [sum of all pairwise intersections] + [sum of all triple-wise intersections] - |D∩G∩S∩H|

But wait, |H| is 900, and all four sets are included. Alternatively, since H is universal, any intersection involving H is just the other sets. Because if someone owns H and, say, D, that's just the same as owning D. So, perhaps some terms can be simplified.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since H is universal, |D ∩ H| is just |D|, because everyone who owns D also owns H. Similarly, |G ∩ H|=|G|, and |S ∩ H|=|S|. Also, any intersection that includes H is just the intersection of the other sets.

So, for example, |D ∩ G ∩ H| is equal to |D ∩ G|, because H is already included in all residents. Similarly, |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ H| is just |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If H is universal, then the intersection of any set with H is the set itself. So, for instance, |D ∩ H| = |D| because all D owners are also H owners. Similarly, |G ∩ H| = |G|, and |S ∩ H| = |S|.

Now, when considering pairwise intersections, like |D ∩ G|, that's just the number of people who own both D and G, regardless of H. But since everyone owns H, the intersection of D and G with H is just |D ∩ G|.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently, considering that H is universal. Let me think about the problem again without H. Since everyone owns H, perhaps the problem reduces to the other three items, but since H is always present, it's included in all counts.

Alternatively, maybe it
