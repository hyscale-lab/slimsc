Okay, so I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let's understand the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 gives a multiple of 7. I need to find the largest such N.

Let me represent N as a four-digit number: N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are its digits, with a from 1-9 and b, c, d from 0-9. When we change any digit to 1, the new number should be divisible by 7.

So, if I change a to 1: 1 b c d is divisible by 7.

Change b to 1: a 1 c d is divisible by 7.

Change c to 1: a b 1 d is divisible by 7.

Change d to 1: a b c 1 is divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. Our goal is to find the largest N (i.e., largest a b c d) that satisfies all four conditions.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, I should probably start from 9999 and check downwards whether it satisfies the conditions. But that might take too long manually. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, let's think about the conditions.

Let me denote the four-digit number as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When we change a to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.

Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d must be divisible by 7.

Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, four conditions:

1) 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2) 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3) 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4) 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm. Let me compute each of these modulo 7 to find relations between the digits.

First, let's find the values of 100, 1000, and 10 modulo 7, since these will help.

7 * 142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 ⇒ 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 ÷ 7: 7*14=98, so 100 - 98 = 2 ⇒ 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ÷ 7 is 3 with remainder 3 ⇒ 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, now, let's rewrite each condition:

1) 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7 ⇒ 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

2) 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7 ⇒ 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

3) 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod7 ⇒ 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7.

4) 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7 ⇒ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So, we now have four congruences:

(1) 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

(2) 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

(3) 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7.

(4) 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7.

Let me denote these equations as Eq(1), Eq(2), Eq(3), Eq(4).

Our variables are a, b, c, d, each digits as per their places.

We need to find a, b, c, d such that all four equations hold, and N is maximized, which is 1000a + 100b +10c +d.

Since we want the largest N, we should try to maximize a first, then b, then c, then d.

So, starting with a=9, then trying to find the maximum possible b, c, d.

But let's see if a=9 is possible, or if we need to decrease a.

Let me see if I can find relationships between the equations.

Let me subtract Eq(1) from Eq(2):

Eq(2) - Eq(1):

(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod7.

Simplify:

6a + 2 - 6 - 2b ≡ 0 mod7 ⇒ 6a - 2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, 6a - 2b ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, can do):

3a - b ≡2 mod7.

So, 3a - b ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Eq(5).

Similarly, subtract Eq(1) from Eq(3):

Eq(3) - Eq(1):

(6a + 2b + 3 + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6a + 3 + 6 - 3c ≡0 mod7.

Wait, no, wait: let's compute each term:

6a -6 + (2b - 2b) + (3 + d - 3c -d) = 6a -6 +3 -3c.

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Wait, 6a -6 comes from 6a -6 (since 6a -6 from 6a + 2b +3 +d minus 6 +2b +3c +d is 6a -6 + 0 + (3 -3c) + (d -d)).

Wait, maybe I should do it term by term:

6a -6 (from 6a -6), then 2b -2b = 0, then 3 -3c, and d -d=0.

So overall, 6a -6 +3 -3c ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6a -3 -3c ≡0 mod7.

Factor 3: 3(2a -1 -c) ≡0
