Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First off, let me recall some basic definitions to make sure I'm on the same page. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC, and it's the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. The incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle, which is tangent to all three sides, and it's the intersection of the angle bisectors.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter I and the circumcenter O. That seems like a significant piece of information. I wonder if there are any known theorems or formulas that relate the inradius, circumradius, and this perpendicularity condition.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: 

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me confirm that. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Given R is 13 and r is 6, so OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1=13. So, OI is sqrt(13). That's good to know.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, triangle OIA has a right angle at I. That means I can apply the Pythagorean theorem here.

In triangle OIA, OA is the distance from the circumcenter to vertex A, which is just the circumradius R, so OA = 13. OI we found is sqrt(13). IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A, which I guess is just the length of the inradius? Wait, no, IA is the segment from incenter I to vertex A, which isn't the inradius itself. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, not to a vertex.

Wait, right, IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A, which isn't the same as the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to BC, for example. So, IA is a different length. Since triangle OIA is right-angled at I, then OA² = OI² + IA². Let me write that down.

OA² = OI² + IA²

We know OA is 13, so OA² is 169. OI² is 13, so plugging in:

169 = 13 + IA²

Subtract 13 from both sides:

IA² = 156

So, IA is sqrt(156). Let's see, sqrt(156) simplifies to sqrt(4*39) which is 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2√
