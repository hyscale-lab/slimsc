Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for their color. I need to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of the grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. Now, the tricky part is that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Moreover, once I place the chips, adding any additional chip should violate one or more of these conditions.

So, the goal is to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. First, each row can have either all white chips, all black chips, or no chips. Similarly, each column can have all white, all black, or none. But wait, if a row has some chips, they must all be the same color. Similarly for columns.

But wait, there's a catch. If a row has, say, white chips, then any column that intersects with that row must have chips of the same color. Because, if a column has even one white chip from that row, then all chips in that column must be white. But if that column has, say, black chips from another row, that would conflict.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of possible configurations.

Each row can be in one of three states: all white (W), all black (B), or empty (E). Similarly, each column can be W, B, or E. But the constraints are such that the color of the row and the color of the column must agree where they intersect. That is, if row i is color C and column j is color D, then if C and D are both present (i.e., not empty), they must be the same color.

So, for example, if row 1 is white and column 1 is black, then cell (1,1) can't have a chip because that would violate both row and column constraints. But if row 1 is white and column 1 is empty, then cell (1,1) can be white. Similarly, if row 1 is empty and column 1 is white, cell (1,1) can be white.

Wait, but the
