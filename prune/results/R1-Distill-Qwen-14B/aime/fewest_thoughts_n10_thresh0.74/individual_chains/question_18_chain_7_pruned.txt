Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. I remember that in regular polygons, the number of sides and the symmetry play a big role in combinatorial problems like this.

First, I should recall how rectangles can be formed in a regular polygon. In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a dodecagon, it's possible to have rectangles because opposite sides are parallel and can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. But wait, a regular dodecagon is more complex than, say, a square or a hexagon. So I need to think about how the vertices can be connected to form rectangles.

I think rectangles in a regular polygon are determined by selecting pairs of parallel sides. Since the dodecagon is regular, all sides and angles are equal, so the sides and diagonals that are parallel will be spaced equally around the polygon.

Let me try to visualize the dodecagon. It's a 12-sided figure, so each central angle is 360/12 = 30 degrees. That means that every side is separated by 30 degrees. Now, the sides can be connected by diagonals, which can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip.

In a regular polygon, the number of diagonals from a vertex is n-3, where n is the number of sides. So for a dodecagon, each vertex connects to 9 diagonals. But not all of these diagonals are parallel to each other.

I remember that in a regular polygon, two diagonals are parallel if the number of sides they skip is the same. For example, in a hexagon, a diagonal that skips one vertex (i.e., connects to the next but one vertex) is parallel to another such diagonal on the opposite side.

Wait, so in a dodecagon, the diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. If a diagonal skips k vertices, then it's a diagonal of the k-th order. The number of sides they skip determines their direction and whether they are parallel.

For instance, in a dodecagon, a diagonal that skips 1 vertex is different from one that skips 2, 3, etc. Now, for two diagonals to be parallel, they must skip the same number of vertices. So, to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of such parallel diagonals.

So, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel diagonals (or sides) such that they intersect each other at right angles. Or wait, no, not necessarily right angles. Wait, no, in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can have angles that are multiples of 30 degrees. So, for a rectangle, the sides must meet at 90 degrees. So, the sides of the rectangle must be either sides of the dodecagon or diagonals that are perpendicular to each other.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides are at 30-degree angles from each other.
