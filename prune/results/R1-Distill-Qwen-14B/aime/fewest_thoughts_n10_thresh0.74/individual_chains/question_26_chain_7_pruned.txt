Alright, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. The problem is about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C to the circle ω intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The goal is to find the length of AP, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC because it's inscribed in the circle. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, line AD intersects the circle ω again at P. So, AP is a segment from A to P on the circle.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside the circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, in this case, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB and DC are equal. So, DB = DC.

I think this might be related to the power of a point. The power of point D with respect to circle ω should be equal to DB² or DC², since DB and DC are tangent lengths. Also, since AD intersects the circle at A and P, the power of D can also be expressed as DP * DA. So, maybe we can set up an equation using the power of point D.

Let me write down what I know:

1. AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. So, triangle ABC has sides 5,9,10.

2. The circumcircle of ABC is ω.

3. Tangents from D touch ω at B and C. So, DB = DC.

4. AD intersects ω again at P. So, points A and P are on ω, and AD is a secant.

So, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

Hmm, so if I can find DB, then I can find DP, and then maybe find AP since AP = AD - DP.

But how do I find DB or DC?

Wait, maybe I can find the length DB in terms of the sides of the triangle. Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry or trigonometry.

Alternatively, maybe using properties of harmonic division or something else.

Alternatively, maybe using inversion, but that might be complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can find the circumradius of triangle ABC and then find the distance from D to the center, but that might not directly help with DB.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that D is the exsimilicenter or something similar.

Wait, another thought: since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, then point D is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle with respect to triangle ABC. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps using triangle areas or coordinates.

Maybe I can place the triangle in coordinate system to calculate coordinates of D and then find the intersection point P.

Let me try that approach.

First, I'll assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC is 10 units long. Then, point B will be somewhere such that AB is 5 and BC is 9.

So, let's assign:

- Point C: (0,0)

- Point A: (10,0)

- Point B: (x,y), need to find coordinates.

We know that AB = 5 and BC = 9.

So, distance from B to A is 5: sqrt[(x -10)^2 + y^2]
