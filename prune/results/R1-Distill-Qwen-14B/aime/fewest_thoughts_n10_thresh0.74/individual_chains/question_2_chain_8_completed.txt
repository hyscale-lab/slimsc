Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to find OC² where C is a specific point on segment AB. The points O, A, and B are given, with O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. 

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, I need to find OC² and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Hmm, let me visualize this. First, the points O, A, and B form a right triangle. O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis. The segment AB connects these two points.

Now, the family F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. That means p² + q² = 1.

Wait, so for any point (p,0) on the x-axis and (0,q) on the y-axis, as long as p² + q² = 1, the segment PQ is part of F. So, each such segment PQ is a line segment between two points on the axes, with the total length 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is on AB and only on AB among all the segments in F.

I think I need to find all the segments PQ in F and find where they intersect AB, then find the point C on AB that isn't on any other PQ except AB.

Alternatively, maybe I should parametrize AB and then find where lines PQ from F intersect AB, and find the point C that isn't covered by any other PQ except AB.

Let me parametrize AB first. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be described parametrically. Let me find the equation of line AB.

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), with x between 0 and 1/2.

Now, for the family F of segments PQ, each PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1. Let me consider the line PQ. The line PQ can be written as y = (-q/p)x + q, since it goes through (p,0) and (0, q).

I need to find the intersection point of line PQ with AB, which is the line y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, let's set the two equations equal:

(-q/p)x + q = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me collect like terms:

[(-q/p) + sqrt(3)]x = sqrt(3)/2 - q.

So,

x = [sqrt(3)/2 - q] / [sqrt(3) - q/p].

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can express q in terms of p, since p² + q² = 1. So, q = sqrt(1 - p²). But then, since p is positive (since we're in the first quadrant), q is also positive.

Wait, but that might complicate things with square roots. Maybe I can parameterize p and q using an angle theta, since p² + q² = 1. Let me think, if I let p = cos(theta) and q = sin(theta), then p² + q² = cos²(theta) + sin²(theta) = 1. That might make the equations easier to handle.

So, let me set p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta). Then, the line PQ is y = (-sin(theta)/cos(theta))x + sin(theta), which simplifies to y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

Now, set this equal to AB's equation, which is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So:

-tan(theta) x + sin(theta) = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let's rearrange terms:

[-tan(theta) + sqrt(3)]x = sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta).

So,

x = [sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta)] / [sqrt(3) - tan(theta)].

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

Let me write tan(theta) as sin(theta)/cos(theta):

x = [sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta)] / [sqrt(3) - sin(theta)/cos(theta)].

Multiply numerator and denominator by cos(theta) to eliminate the fraction in the denominator:

x = [ (sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta)) * cos(theta) ] / [ sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) ].

Hmm, that might be better. Let me denote this as:

x(theta) = [ (sqrt(3)/2 cos(theta) - sin(theta) cos(theta) ) ] / [ sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) ].

Wait a second, I notice that the denominator is sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta). The numerator has sqrt(3)/2 cos(theta) - sin(theta) cos(theta). Maybe I can factor something out.

Let me factor out cos(theta) in the numerator:

x(theta) = [ cos(theta) ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta) ) ] / [ sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) ].

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write the denominator in terms of a single sine or cosine function.

Denominator: sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) = 2 [ (sqrt(3)/2 cos(theta)) - (1/2 sin(theta)) ) ].

Wait, that looks like the formula for cos(theta + 30 degrees), since cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B.

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is cos(30°), and 1/2 is sin(30°). So, this would be 2 cos(theta + 30°), because:

sqrt(3)/2 cos(theta) - 1/2 sin(theta) = cos(theta + 30°).

So, denominator = 2 cos(theta + 30°).

Similarly, the numerator: sqrt(3)/2 cos(theta) - sin(theta) cos(theta) = cos(theta) [ sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta) ].

Hmm, maybe I can relate this somehow. Let me try:

x(theta) = [ cos(theta) ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta) ) ] / [ 2 cos(theta + 30°) ].

Hmm, perhaps I can write sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta) as something. Let me think if that relates to another angle.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this as:

sqrt(3)/2 = cos(30°), so sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta) = cos(30°) - sin(theta).

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let me consider that perhaps the numerator can also be expressed using a sine or cosine identity.

Wait, maybe I can write the numerator as sqrt(3)/2 cos(theta) - sin(theta) cos(theta) = cos(theta) [ sqrt(3)/2 - sin(theta) ].

Alternatively, maybe it's better to proceed by considering that for each theta, we get a point C on AB that is the intersection of PQ and AB. Then, we're to find the point C that's only on AB and no other PQ. So, perhaps C is such that it's the envelope point for all these lines PQ. Alternatively, maybe it's the point where all these PQ lines are tangent to some curve, and C is the point where this envelope touches AB.

Alternatively, perhaps the set of all PQ lines forms a envelope, and the point C is where this envelope is tangent to AB.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of envelope of lines. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of a family of lines at some point.

So, perhaps the family F of lines PQ forms an envelope, and the point C is where this envelope touches AB.

But I'm not too familiar with envelopes, so maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the condition that for point C on AB, there's exactly one PQ in F that passes through C. Then, the point C where this happens only once (i.e., it's the unique point that lies on only one PQ) is the point we're looking for.

Wait, but the problem states that C is on AB and not on any other PQ except AB, so AB is the only segment in F that passes through C.

Wait, but AB is part of F? Let me check: AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The length of AB is sqrt[ (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) ] = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh! So AB is itself a segment in F, since its length is 1 and it connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis.

So, AB is part of the family F. Therefore, the point C lies on AB and on another PQ only if there's another segment in F that passes through C. But the problem says that C is on AB and not on any other PQ from F except AB. So, we need to find the unique point C on AB that's only on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, perhaps I can parametrize AB and find the point where the intersection of AB with PQ (for some PQ in F) is unique, meaning that the system has only one solution.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the point C on AB such that there's exactly one line PQ in F that passes through C. But since AB is already in F, perhaps we can find C such that any other PQ in F doesn't pass through C.

Wait, but how? Maybe the point C is where the line AB is tangent to some envelope formed by the family F.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of optimization. Maybe the point C is the point on AB where the distance from C to the x-axis and y-axis is such that it's the point where the only segment PQ passing through it is AB itself.

Wait, perhaps if I can find the point C on AB where the line PQ through C would have p and q such that p² + q² = 1. But for other points, there might be two lines, so maybe C is where the system has a unique solution.

Wait, perhaps I can parametrize C as a point on AB and then find the number of solutions for the lines PQ in F that pass through it.

So, let's take a general point C on AB. Let's say C is at (x, y), where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, as before. So, for C to lie on a segment PQ from F, which is from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1, the point (x, y) must lie on the line PQ.

The line PQ has the equation y = (-q/p)x + q.

So, substituting (x, y) into this equation:

y = (-q/p)x + q.

But since y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, we have:

-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = (-q/p)x + q.

Let me rearrange this:

(-q/p + sqrt(3))x = q - sqrt(3)/2.

So,

x = [q - sqrt(3)/2] / [sqrt(3) - q/p].

Wait, but for a given x, there's a corresponding q and p that satisfy this equation, as long as p² + q² = 1.

So, for each point C on AB, the equation above must hold for some p and q with p² + q² = 1.

But we want the point C where this equation is satisfied for exactly one pair (p, q). Since AB is part of F, at least one solution exists. We need the point where only one solution exists, i.e., where the system has exactly one solution for p and q.

Hmm, so perhaps I can treat this as a system of equations and find when it has exactly one solution.

Let me write the equations:

1. p² + q² = 1.

2. [ q - sqrt(3)/2 ] / [ sqrt(3) - q/p ] = x.

But x is a point on AB, so x can be written in terms of t, say, as x = t, and y = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2, where t ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, maybe parametrizing C as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t is between 0 and 1/2.

So, substituting x = t into the equation:

t = [ q - sqrt(3)/2 ] / [ sqrt(3) - q/p ].

Hmm, but p and q are related by p² + q² = 1.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this as:

t = [ q - sqrt(3)/2 ] / [ sqrt(3) - (q/p) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by p:

t = [ q p - (sqrt(3)/2) p ] / [ sqrt(3) p - q ]

But from the equation of the line PQ passing through C, we have:

-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = (-q/p) t + q

Which rearranges to:

(-q/p + sqrt(3)) t = q - sqrt(3)/2

So,

t = [ q - sqrt(3)/2 ] / [ sqrt(3) - q/p ]

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

t = [ q - sqrt(3)/2 ] / [ sqrt(3) - q/p ]

Let me express this as:

t = [ q - sqrt(3)/2 ] * [ 1 / ( sqrt(3) - q/p ) ]

But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can express p in terms of q, since p² = 1 - q², so p = sqrt(1 - q²). But since p is positive, as it's on the x-axis in the first quadrant, we can take p = sqrt(1 - q²).

Wait, but then the denominator becomes sqrt(3) - q / sqrt(1 - q²). Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me write s = q, then p = sqrt(1 - s²). Then, the equation becomes:

t = [ s - sqrt(3)/2 ] / [ sqrt(3) - s / sqrt(1 - s²) ]

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I can square both sides or do something else. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation.

Let me denote the denominator as D = sqrt(3) - s / sqrt(1 - s²).

So, t = (s - sqrt(3)/2) / D.

Multiply both sides by D:

t * D = s - sqrt(3)/2.

So,

t (sqrt(3) - s / sqrt(1 - s²)) = s - sqrt(3)/2.

Let me distribute t:

t sqrt(3) - t s / sqrt(1 - s²) = s - sqrt(3)/2.

This seems quite involved. Maybe I can rearrange terms to collect like terms.

Bring all terms to one side:

t sqrt(3) - t s / sqrt(1 - s²) - s + sqrt(3)/2 = 0.

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe it's better to consider this as an equation in s and find the condition for which it has exactly one solution. So, perhaps the discriminant is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that for the point C to lie only on AB and no other PQ from F, the system of equations has only one solution. So, when the equation above has exactly one solution for s (and hence for q), that point C is the one we're looking for.

Wait, perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to consider the envelope of the family of lines F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. So, if I can find the envelope, then find where this envelope intersects AB, that point would be C, since it's the only point on AB touched by the envelope, meaning only AB passes through it among all PQ lines.

So, how do I find the envelope of the family F?

The family F consists of lines PQ, each parametrized by p and q with p² + q² = 1. So, the equation of each line is:

y = (-q/p)x + q.

Alternatively, we can write this as:

y = -(q/p)x + q.

Let me consider this as a function of x, with parameters p and q, but subject to p² + q² = 1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve the system:

F(x, y, p, q) = y + (q/p)x - q = 0,

and the derivative with respect to the parameter (here, perhaps p or q) is zero.

Wait, but since p and q are related by p² + q² = 1, maybe I can express q in terms of p, as q = sqrt(1 - p²), and then write the line equation in terms of p only.

So, substituting q = sqrt(1 - p²), the line becomes:

y = [ -sqrt(1 - p²)/p ] x + sqrt(1 - p²).

Let me denote this as F(x, y, p) = y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) x - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0.

To find the envelope, we take the derivative of F with respect to p and set it to zero.

So,

dF/dp = [ derivative of y term ] + [ derivative of (sqrt(1 - p²)/p x) term ] + [ derivative of (-sqrt(1 - p²)) term ].

But since y is treated as a function, perhaps I should approach this differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat F as F(x, y, p) = 0, and find the envelope by solving F(x, y, p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

Wait, let me try this approach. Let me define F(x, y, p) = y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) x - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0.

Compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = 0 + [ derivative of (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) x ] - [ derivative of sqrt(1 - p²) ].

Let me compute each part.

First, the derivative of (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) x with respect to p:

Let me denote f(p) = sqrt(1 - p²)/p. Then, f'(p) is [ ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p²))) * (-2p) ) * p - sqrt(1 - p²) * 1 ] / p².

Wait, that's using the quotient rule: d/dp [ numerator / denominator ].

Wait, more carefully:

f(p) = (sqrt(1 - p²)) / p.

So, f'(p) = [ ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p²))) * (-2p) ) * p - sqrt(1 - p²) * 1 ] / p².

Simplify numerator:

= [ ( (-p / sqrt(1 - p²)) ) * p - sqrt(1 - p²) ) ] / p²

= [ (-p² / sqrt(1 - p²)) - sqrt(1 - p²) ) ] / p²

Combine terms over a common denominator:

= [ (-p² - (1 - p²)) / sqrt(1 - p²) ) ] / p²

Simplify numerator inside:

- p² - 1 + p² = -1

So,

= [ (-1) / sqrt(1 - p²) ) ] / p²

= -1 / [ p² sqrt(1 - p²) ) ]

So, the derivative of the second term is x * f'(p) = -x / [ p² sqrt(1 - p²) ) ].

Now, the derivative of the third term, -sqrt(1 - p²), is:

= - [ (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p²))) ) * (-2p) ) ]

= p / sqrt(1 - p²).

So, putting it all together, dF/dp is:

dF/dp = [ -x / (p² sqrt(1 - p²)) ) ] + [ p / sqrt(1 - p²) ) ] = 0.

So,

[ -x / (p² sqrt(1 - p²)) ) ] + [ p / sqrt(1 - p²) ) ] = 0.

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - p²):

- x / p² + p = 0.

So,

p = x / p².

Multiply both sides by p²:

p³ = x.

So, p = x^(1/3).

Hmm, interesting. So, from dF/dp = 0, we get p = x^(1/3).

Now, from F(x, y, p) = 0, we have:

y = [ -sqrt(1 - p²)/p ] x + sqrt(1 - p²).

Let me substitute p = x^(1/3) into this equation.

So, p = x^(1/3), so p² = x^(2/3), and sqrt(1 - p²) = sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)).

So,

y = [ -sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)) / x^(1/3) ] * x + sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)).

Simplify each term.

First term: [ -sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)) / x^(1/3) ] * x = - x^(2/3) sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)).

Second term: sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)).

So,

y = -x^(2/3) sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)) + sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)).

Factor out sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)):

y = sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)) (1 - x^(2/3)).

Hmm, so y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Wait, let me check:

sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)) is (1 - x^(2/3))^(1/2).

Then, (1 - x^(2/3)) is (1 - x^(2/3)).

So, multiplying them gives (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Yes, that's correct.

So, the envelope curve is y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Now, we need to find where this envelope intersects AB. The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, set (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2) = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me denote t = x^(1/3), so x = t³.

Then, x^(2/3) = t², and 1 - x^(2/3) = 1 - t².

So, (1 - t²)^(3/2) = -sqrt(3) t³ + sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can solve for t.

Let me write the equation as:

(1 - t²)^(3/2) + sqrt(3) t³ - sqrt(3)/2 = 0.

This looks challenging. Maybe I can try to find a rational root, perhaps t = 1/2.

Let's test t = 1/2:

Left side: (1 - (1/2)^2)^(3/2) + sqrt(3) (1/2)^3 - sqrt(3)/2.

= (1 - 1/4)^(3/2) + sqrt(3)(1/8) - sqrt(3)/2.

= (3/4)^(3/2) + sqrt(3)/8 - sqrt(3)/2.

(3/4)^(3/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3)) / 8.

So,

= (3 sqrt(3)/8) + sqrt(3)/8 - (4 sqrt(3)/8).

= (3 sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) - 4 sqrt(3)) / 8.

= 0.

So, t = 1/2 is a solution.

Great! So, t = 1/2 is a solution. Therefore, x = t³ = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.

So, the point C is at x = 1/8 on the x-axis.

Then, the y-coordinate is y = -sqrt(3)*x + sqrt(3)/2 = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, the point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Now, we need to compute OC², where O is the origin (0,0). So,

OC² = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + (27)/64 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Wait, that simplifies to 7/16.

Wait, but 28/64 is 7/16, correct.

So, OC² = 7/16, so p = 7, q = 16, and p + q = 23.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated y, I had:

y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

With x = 1/8, x^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) = 1/(4) = 1/4.

So, 1 - x^(2/3) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

Then, (3/4)^(3/2) = (sqrt(3/4))^3 = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3)) / 8.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

Then, the y-coordinate from AB is:

y = -sqrt(3) * (1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Then, OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.

= 1/64 + (27)/64.

Which is 28/64 = 7/16.

Yes, that's correct.

So, p = 7, q = 16. They are coprime, so p + q = 23.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{23}


Given points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \), we need to find the point \( C \) on segment \( \overline{AB} \) that does not lie on any other segment from the family \( \mathcal{F} \) of unit length segments \( \overline{PQ} \) with \( P \) on the \( x \)-axis and \( Q \) on the \( y \)-axis, except for \( \overline{AB} \) itself.

1. **Equation of Line \( \overline{AB} \)**:
   The slope of \( \overline{AB} \) is \( -\sqrt{3} \), giving the equation:
   \[
   y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]

2. **Parametrization of Segments \( \overline{PQ} \)**:
   Each segment \( \overline{PQ} \) has endpoints \( (p, 0) \) and \( (0, q) \) with \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \). The line equation for \( \overline{PQ} \) is:
   \[
   y = -\frac{q}{p}x + q
   \]

3. **Envelope of Lines**:
   The envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \) is found by solving the system:
   \[
   y = -\frac{\sqrt{1 - p^2}}{p}x + \sqrt{1 - p^2}
   \]
   and the derivative condition \( \frac{dF}{dp} = 0 \), leading to \( p = x^{1/3} \).

4. **Intersection with Envelope**:
   Substituting \( p = x^{1/3} \) into the envelope equation, we find the envelope curve:
   \[
   y = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}
   \]
   Setting this equal to the line \( \overline{AB} \) and solving, we find \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) and \( y = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \).

5. **Coordinates of Point \( C \)**:
   The point \( C \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right) \).

6. **Calculation of \( OC^2 \)**:
   \[
   OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}
   \]

Thus, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is \( 7 + 16 = 23 \).

\[
\boxed{23}
\]
