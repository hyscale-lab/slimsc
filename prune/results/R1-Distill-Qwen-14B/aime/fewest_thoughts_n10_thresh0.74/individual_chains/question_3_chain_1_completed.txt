Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me try to break it down.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the chosen four. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, P(A|B) is the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, that automatically means she has at least two numbers among the chosen four. So, A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to find P(A) and P(B).

First, let's figure out the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination of 10 choose 4. Let me compute that.

10 choose 4 is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, total possible outcomes are 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she picked 4 specific numbers, there's only 1 way this can happen. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. Hmm, how do I compute that?

It might be easier to compute the probability of the complement event and then subtract from 1. The complement of having at least two numbers chosen is having fewer than two, which means having 0 or 1 of her numbers chosen.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(0 or 1 numbers chosen).

So, let's compute P(0 numbers chosen) and P(1 number chosen).

First, the total number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is 210, as we found earlier.

P(0 numbers chosen): This means all 4 chosen numbers are from the remaining 6 numbers (since Jen picked 4, leaving 6 others). So, the number of ways is 6 choose 4. Let me calculate that: 6C4 = 15.

So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with none of Jen's is 15. So, P(0) = 15 / 210.

P(1 number chosen): This is the number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6. So, that's 4C1 * 6C3.

Let me compute 4C1 = 4, 6C3 = 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the number of ways to choose exactly 1 of Jen's numbers is 80. So, P(1) = 80 / 210.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Simplify that fraction: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, wait a second. Let me verify that. Sometimes, when I subtract, I might make a mistake.

Total ways: 210.

Number of ways with 0 of Jen's numbers: 6C4 = 15.

Number of ways with exactly 1: 4C1 *6C3=4*20=80.

So, 15 +80=95.

So, 210 -95=115. So, P(B)=115/210=23/42. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, P(B) is 23/42.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (1*42)/(210*23).

Simplify 42/210. 42 is a factor of 210. 210 ÷42=5. So, 42/210=1/5.

So, P(A|B)= (1/5)/23=1/(5*23)=1/115.

Wait, that seems low. Let me check the steps again.

P(A) is 1/210. P(B) is 115/210.

So, (1/210)/(115/210) = (1/210)*(210/115)=1/115. Hmm, yes, that's correct.

So, the probability is 1/115. So, m=1, n=115. Are they coprime? Yes, because 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 is coprime with any number.

So, m +n=1+115=116.

Wait, but before I conclude, let me think again. Is there another way to compute P(B) that might give a different result?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute P(B) directly by summing the probabilities of exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers chosen.

So, let's try that.

Number of ways to choose exactly 2 of Jen's numbers: 4C2 *6C2.

4C2=6, 6C2=15. So, 6*15=90.

Number of ways to choose exactly 3 of Jen's numbers: 4C3 *6C1=4*6=24.

Number of ways to choose exactly 4 of Jen's numbers: 4C4 *6C0=1*1=1.

So, total favorable for B: 90 +24 +1=115. Which matches with earlier calculation. So, P(B)=115/210=23/42.

So, P(A|B)=1/115. So, answer is 1 +115=116.

Wait, but just to double-check, 23/42 is approximately 0.5476, and 1/115 is about 0.0087. That seems low, but considering how rare the grand prize is compared to just getting two numbers, I think it makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.

Is P(A|B) the same as the probability that all four numbers match, given that at least two match?

Yes.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1.

The number of favorable outcomes for B is 115.

So, the conditional probability is 1/115, as computed.

Another way to think about it: Given that at least two numbers match, how likely is it that all four match?

Since the only way for all four to match is when exactly four match, which is 1 case. So, out of all cases where at least two match (which is 115), the case where all four match is 1. So, probability is 1/115.

Yes, that seems right.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we use the formula:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

Here, \(A\) is the event of winning the grand prize, and \(B\) is the event of winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means winning a prize, \(A \cap B = A\), so:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:

\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = 210
\]

**Calculating \(P(A)\):**

The number of favorable outcomes for winning the grand prize is 1 (since Jen must have all 4 chosen numbers). Thus,

\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

**Calculating \(P(B)\):**

\(B\) is the event of winning a prize, which occurs if at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. Instead of calculating this directly, we find the complement probability (having fewer than two numbers chosen) and subtract it from 1.

1. **Probability of 0 numbers chosen (none of Jen's numbers):**

\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15
\]

2. **Probability of 1 number chosen:**

\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

The total number of unfavorable outcomes is:

\[
15 + 80 = 95
\]

Thus,

\[
P(B) = 1 - \frac{95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

**Calculating \(P(A|B)\):**

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{1}{115}\) is already in its simplest form, so \(m = 1\) and \(n = 115\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 115 = 116\).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
