Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length AP in a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. The sides AB, BC, and AC are given as 5, 9, and 10 units respectively. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then I need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, first, I should probably confirm if this is a valid triangle. The sum of AB and BC is 5+9=14, which is greater than AC=10. Similarly, other side sums are also valid, so it's a valid triangle.

Now, the triangle is inscribed in a circle ω, which means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C to ω meet at point D. I remember that the point where the two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that, but more importantly, D is the ex-pole with respect to BC. Also, since D lies on the tangent at B and C, DB and DC are tangents to the circle ω.

Wait, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB = DC. That's a useful property. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Next, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. So starting from A, going through D, and intersecting the circle again at P. So AP is longer than AD.

I need to find AP. Hmm, I remember some theorems related to power of a point, harmonic division, maybe some properties related to poles and polars. Alternatively, maybe using Ceva's theorem or Menelaus' theorem.

Let me consider the power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D should be equal to DB^2 (since DB is a tangent to ω at B). Similarly, DC^2 is equal to the power of D as well. Since DB=DC, this makes sense.

So, power of D: DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP. Because AD passes through P, which is the second intersection point with ω. So, DA * DP = DB^2.

Therefore, if I can find DA and DB, I can find DP, and since AP = AD + DP (wait, no, AP is actually AD extended beyond D to P, so AP = AD + DP, but wait, actually, since D is outside the circle, AD passes through the circle at A and P, so AP = AD + DP? Wait, no, AD is from A to D, and then extended to P. So AP would be the length from A to P, which is longer than AD. So, the power of D would relate the lengths as DA * DP = DB^2.

Wait, actually, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2, and since AD passes through ω at A and P, the power of D is DA * DP. So:

DB^2 = DA * DP.

But DP is the length from D to P, and DA is from D to A. So, DP = AP - AD? No, wait, AP is from A to P, and AD is from A to D, so DP = AP - AD? Hmm, not quite. Let me think in terms of directed lengths.

Wait, maybe it's better to write in terms of segments:

AD is from A to D, and then beyond D to P. So the entire length from A to P is AP. The segment from A to D is AD, and from D to P is DP. So, AP = AD + DP. But in terms of power of a point
