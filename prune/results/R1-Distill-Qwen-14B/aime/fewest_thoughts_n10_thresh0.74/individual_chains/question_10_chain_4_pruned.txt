Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. So Alice picks some set A, and Bob creates a list of all possible finite, non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. My goal is to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me break this down. So for any set B, it's finite and non-empty, and its maximum element must be in A. So for each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum?

Well, if a is the maximum, then all the other elements of B must be less than a. So for each a in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum a would be the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, excluding the empty set. Because each such subset can be combined with {a} to form a set where a is the maximum.

Wait, no, actually, if the maximum is a, then B must include a and any combination of numbers less than a. So the number of such sets is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because each subset can be combined with a to form a set B with maximum a. But since B has to be non-empty, the empty subset wouldn't count, right?

Wait, no, hold on. Because B is a non-empty set. But when we add a to a subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, even if that subset is empty, the set B would just be {a}, which is non-empty. So actually, for each a in A, the number of possible B sets with maximum a is 2^{a-1}.

Because {1,2,...,a-1} has (a-1) elements, so it has 2^{a-1} subsets, each of which can be combined with a to form a set B with maximum a. So for each a, the number of such B is 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

Given that Bob has 2024 sets, this sum equals 2024. So, the equation is:

sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

So, I need to find a set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024. Then, I can find the sum of elements in A.

But what is A? It's a set of positive integers, so all a's are distinct. So I need to find a set of distinct positive integers where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a is 2024.

Wait, this looks like a binary representation problem. Because
