Okay, so I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, this seems like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let me start by recalling the inclusion-exclusion principle. I remember that for multiple sets, the total number of elements in the union is equal to the sum of the sizes of the sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections and so on, alternating signs each time. But in this problem, we're given some specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three ownerships. I think I need to use that information to find the number of people who own all four.

Let me jot down the given numbers:

- Total residents: 900.
- Diamond ring owners: 195.
- Golf clubs owners: 367.
- Garden spade owners: 562.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.

Wait, so actually, the bag of candy hearts is owned by all residents. That means that the set of candy heart owners is the entire population. So when we're considering intersections, being a candy heart owner is automatically included in everyone. Hmm, that might simplify things a bit.

But wait, the problem states that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts set is size 900. So, for any other item, the intersection with candy hearts is just that other item's size, because everyone has candy hearts. So, for example, the number of people who own both a diamond ring and candy hearts is just the number of diamond ring owners, which is 195. Similarly for golf clubs and garden spades. 

But wait, maybe not, because some people might own only candy hearts and nothing else. But no, because the problem says that each owns a bag of candy hearts. So, actually, the candy hearts are present in every resident. So, any intersection involving candy hearts is just the other item's count. Hmm, maybe that's a useful point.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model all four items as sets. Let me denote:

- D: set of diamond ring owners (size 195)
- G: set of golf clubs
