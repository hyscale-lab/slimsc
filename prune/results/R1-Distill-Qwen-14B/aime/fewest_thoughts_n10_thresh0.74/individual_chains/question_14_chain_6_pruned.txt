Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

First, let me break down what the problem is saying. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if I change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. So, no matter which digit I pick (thousands, hundreds, tens, or units place), replacing it with 1 should result in a number that's a multiple of 7.

My goal is to find the largest such N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder), and then add Q and R together.

Hmm, okay. So first, let's think about what it means for a number to be divisible by 7. A number is divisible by 7 if, when divided by 7, it leaves no remainder. But checking divisibility by 7 isn't as straightforward as, say, checking for 3 or 9, where you just sum the digits. There are some tricks, but I might need to do actual division here.

Since the problem involves changing each digit to 1 and checking divisibility, perhaps I can model N as a four-digit number with digits a, b, c, d. So, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When we change any digit to 1, we get a new number. For example:
- Changing the thousands digit to 1: 1bcd = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.
- Changing the hundreds digit to 1: a1cd = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d.
- Changing the tens digit to 1: ab1d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d.
- Changing the units digit to 1: abc1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1.

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, mathematically, this gives us four conditions:
1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But N itself, which is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, doesn't necessarily have to be divisible by 7, right? Only the numbers obtained by changing one digit to 1 must be divisible by 7.

Wait, but maybe N has some relation to 7 as well. Let me see.

Since all these modified numbers are divisible by 7, perhaps there's a way to find constraints on each digit.

Let me consider each condition one by one. Let me represent N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

So, condition 1 is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7 first. 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, and 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, condition 1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, condition 2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 3: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 4: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So now, I have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.   (Condition 1)
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.   (Condition 2)
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.   (Condition 3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.  (Condition 4)

So, I have four equations modulo 7 involving a, b, c, d. Since a, b, c, d are digits, each between 0 and 9, except a which cannot be 0 (since it's a four-digit number).

Wait, but a is the thousands digit, so it's from 1 to 9, and b, c, d are from 0 to 9.

I need to find digits a, b, c, d such that all four conditions hold, and N is as large as possible.

Since we're looking for the greatest N, we probably want to maximize a first, then b, then c, then d.

So let's aim for a=9, then b=9, then c=9, then d=9, but we have to check if the conditions are satisfied. If not, we decrease digits starting from the right.

But with four conditions, maybe it's better to find relations between a, b, c, d.

Let me write down the four equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.  --> Equation (1)
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.  --> Equation (2)
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.  --> Equation (3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. --> Equation (4)

Let me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2) to eliminate 3c + d.

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7.

Simplify:

6a + 2 -6 -2b ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 6a -2b -4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me rewrite that:

6a -2b ≡ 4 mod 7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):

3a - b ≡ 2 mod 7.

So, Equation (A): 3a - b ≡ 2 mod 7.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (3):

(6a + 2b + 3c + 1) - (6a + 2b + 3 + d) ≡ 0 -0 mod7.

Simplify:

3c +1 -3 -d ≡0 mod7.

Which is 3c - d -2 ≡ 0 mod7.

So, 3c - d ≡ 2 mod7.  --> Equation (B)

Now, let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (1):

(6a + 2b + 3c +1) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod7.

Simplify:

6a +2b +3c +1 -6 -2b -3c -d ≡0 mod7.

Which becomes: 6a -5 -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -d ≡5 mod7.  --> Equation (C)

So now, from Equation (A), (B), (C), and the original equations, we have some relations.

But perhaps it's better to express variables in terms of others.

From Equation (A): 3a - b ≡2 mod7. So, b ≡3a -2 mod7.

Similarly, from Equation (C): d ≡6a -5 mod7.

From Equation (B): 3c - d ≡2 mod7. So, 3c ≡ d +2 mod7. Substituting d from Equation (C): 3c ≡ (6a -5) +2 mod7 => 3c ≡6a -3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):

c ≡ 2a -1 mod7.  --> Equation (D)

So now, we have:

b ≡3a -2 mod7.  --> Equation (A)
d ≡6a -5 mod7.  --> Equation (C)
c ≡2a -1 mod7.  --> Equation (D)

So, the digits b, c, d are each congruent to expressions involving a modulo7.

But since each digit is between 0-9, their values modulo7 can be determined, and so their actual values can be expressed as:

b = (3a -2) +7k1, where k1 is such that b is between 0 and 9.

Similarly,

c = (2a -1) +
