Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. 

First, let me list down all the information given. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Then there are other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 for diamond rings, 367 for golf clubs, and 562 for garden spades. 

So, each resident owns at least the candy hearts. But they might also own some combination of the other three items. Now, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. And we're asked to find how many own all four—diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem that involves sets and maybe the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps in calculating the size of the union of multiple sets by considering their individual sizes and their intersections. But since we have information about exactly two and exactly three items owned, I might need to model this using a Venn diagram with four sets, but that can get complicated. Let's see.

Wait, each resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, actually, the candy hearts are a given for everyone. That means all the other items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are optional. So, the four things are: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades.

So, maybe I can model this using the principle where each resident is in at least one of the four categories, but since candy hearts are mandatory, actually, they are in all the four categories in terms of having at least one. Wait, no. Wait, each person has a bag of candy hearts, so they all have that. But for the other three, they have some subset.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the problem as four sets: C (candy hearts), D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades). Since everyone has C, the total population is 900, so C has 900 elements. D has 195, G has 367, S has 562.

But the problem is about the overlaps between D, G, S, and C. Wait, no, because C is universal—everyone has it. So, the other three items are the ones that are subsets of C. So, maybe the question is about the overlaps among D, G, and S within the context of C.

Wait, perhaps that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider all four items, but since C is universal, the problem is really about the overlaps of D, G, S, and how many have all four.

Wait, no. Because all residents have C, so when someone owns all four, it's the same as owning all three of D, G, S, plus C. So, the problem might just boil down to finding the number of people who own D, G, and S, since C is already included.

Alternatively, maybe I should model this as a Venn diagram with four sets, but that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, since D, G, and S are the variables here. Wait, but the problem gives data about exactly two and exactly three of these things. So, maybe I can use that.

Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets D, G, S. The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But wait, |D ∪ G ∪ S| would give the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone has C, which is separate, but they can also have D, G, S. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that all the people in D, G, S also have C, so perhaps the counts are within the 900.

Wait, but since C is universal, the total number of people who don't have D, G, or S is 900 minus |D ∪ G ∪ S|. But I don't know if that's necessary here.

Wait, the problem mentions that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But which things? Because each of these things includes candy hearts, right? Or is it that the 437 own exactly two of the four things, including C? Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear but likely refers to exactly two of the four. Wait,
