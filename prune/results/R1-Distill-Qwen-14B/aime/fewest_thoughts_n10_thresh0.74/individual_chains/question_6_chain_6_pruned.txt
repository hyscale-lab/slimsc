Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.

We have two functions defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, we're looking at the graphs of y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). The question is asking for the number of intersections between these two graphs.

Hmm. So, intersections occur when both equations are satisfied simultaneously. That means we need to find (x, y) such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). 

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me first try to understand the functions f and g.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The absolute value inside another absolute value. Let me think about how this function behaves.

If x is positive, |x| is just x, so f(x) becomes |x - 1/2|. Similarly, if x is negative, |x| is -x, so f(x) becomes |-x - 1/2| = |x + 1/2|. So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph with possible vertices at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2.

Wait, no, actually, since it's f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, the inner absolute value will make the function symmetric about the y-axis. So, f(x) is symmetric for x >=0 and x <=0. Let me plot it mentally.

For x >= 0, f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So, that's a V shape with vertex at x=1/2, y=0. For x <0, f(x) = |-x -1/2| = |x + 1/2|. So that's another V shape with vertex at x=-1/2, y=0. So overall, f(x) is a W-shaped function, with minima at x=1/2 and x=-1/2, both at y=0, and it goes up on either side.

Wait, actually, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have ||x| - a|, it's like taking |x|, shifting it by a, and then taking absolute value again. So, it's a V shape that's been shifted and then reflected. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider f(x) as the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2. So, for x >= 0, |x| is x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|. Similarly, for x <0, |x| is -x, so f(x) = |-x -1/2| = |x +1/2|. So, f(x) has a V shape on the right side (x >=0) with vertex at x=1/2, and a V shape on the left side (x <=0) with vertex at x=-1/2. So, the overall graph is a W shape, with the bottom at y=0 at x=-1/2 and x=1/2, and it goes up on either end. So, yes, that's correct.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So, similar reasoning. For x >=0, g(x) = |x -1/4|, which is V-shaped with vertex at x=1/4, y=0. For x <0, g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x +1/4|, V-shaped with vertex at x=-1/4, y=0. So, g(x) is a W-shaped function with the bottom at x=-1/4 and x=1/4, y=0, and it goes up on either end.

Now, the functions we're dealing with are 4*g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4*g(f(cos(3πy))). These look a bit complex, but perhaps I can analyze them by understanding the composition of functions.

Let me first consider the inner functions: sin(2πx) and cos(3πy). These are sine and cosine functions with different periods. The sin(2πx) has a period of 1 because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so 2π/(2π) =1. Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So, sin(2πx) repeats every 1 unit, and cos(3πy) repeats every 2/3 units in y.

But wait, actually, when considering cos(3πy), the variable is y, so the period along the y-axis is 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So, for each unit increase in y, the cosine function completes 3π/(2π) = 3/2 cycles. Hmm, maybe that's not the most important point right now.

Let me try to understand the composition.

First, let's take f(sin(2πx)). Since f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, and sin(2πx) is a function that ranges between -1 and 1. So, let's see: sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, so
