Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity and not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that connects to the product.

The product given is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me first think about each term in the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern.

Looking at 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}, I can rewrite it as (ω^{k})² - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me denote x = ω^k for a moment. So, each term becomes x² - 2x + 2. So, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k.

Wait, but ω^k for k from 0 to 12 are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1 when k=0. So, if I think about it, the product is the product over all 13th roots of unity of the expression x² - 2x + 2. So, if I let P(x) = x² - 2x + 2, then the product is P(ω^0) * P(ω^1) * ... * P(ω^{12}).

But I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x¹³ - 1, since ω^k are the roots of x¹³ - 1 = 0. But in this case, we're dealing with a product of P(ω^k), which is a quadratic in each ω^k.

Wait, maybe I can consider the product as evaluating another polynomial at certain points. Since P(x) is a quadratic, perhaps the product over all roots ω^k is related to some resultant or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the polynomial whose roots are the ω^k, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + 1, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the product as the product of (x² - 2x +
