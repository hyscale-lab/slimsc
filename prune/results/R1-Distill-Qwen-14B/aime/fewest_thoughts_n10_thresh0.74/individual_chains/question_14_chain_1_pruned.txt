Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let Q and R be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when N is divided by 1000. Find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, the largest possible, with a certain property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, when N is divided by 1000, we get Q as the quotient and R as the remainder. We need to find Q + R.

Alright, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. We need the greatest such N, so we should start looking from 9999 downwards until we find a number that satisfies this condition.

The key condition here is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Wait, is that right? Or does it mean that changing any one digit to 1, regardless of which digit, including possibly the same digit multiple times? But I think the problem says "whenever one of its digits is changed to 1," so each digit can be changed individually once to 1, and each time, the resulting number must be divisible by 7.

So, each of the four possible numbers formed by changing each digit to 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, for N = ABCD (a four-digit number), the following numbers must be divisible by 7:

- 1BCD
- A1CD
- AB1D
- ABC1

So, all four of these numbers must be divisible by 7. That's the condition.

Our goal is to find the largest such N. So, let's think about how to approach this.

One approach is to consider N = ABCD, and express each of these four numbers in terms of N or its digits, then set up congruences modulo 7.

But that might get a bit complicated because we have to handle each digit position. Alternatively, maybe we can find some patterns or constraints on the digits of N.

Wait, let's consider each changed digit case:

1. Changing the thousands digit (A) to 1: The number becomes 1BCD. Let's denote N1 = 1BCD. So, N1 must be divisible by 7.

Similarly:

2. Changing the hundreds digit (B) to 1: N2 = A1CD must be divisible by 7.

3. Changing the tens digit (C) to 1: N3 = AB1D must be divisible by 7.

4. Changing the units digit (D) to 1: N4 = ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me write N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, N1 is 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly,

N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D,

N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D,

N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, we can write:

1. N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,

2. N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,

3. N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,

4. N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me express each of these in terms of N. Let's see:

N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A - 1000B - 1000C -1000D?) Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, N1 is equal to 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So, N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000A) because N = 1000A + 100B + 10
