Okay, so I came across this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon red or blue. The problem is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the original red ones were. The answer needs to be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then we have to find m + n. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a regular octagon, which means all its sides and angles are equal. Each vertex is going to be colored either red or blue, and each color is equally likely, so each vertex has a 50% chance of being red or blue. After coloring, we want to check if there's some rotation of the octagon (by 45 degrees increments, since a full rotation is 360 and 360/8=45) such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, essentially, we need a permutation of the vertices via rotation where blue vertices are mapped to red ones.

Wait, but the original octagon has some red and blue vertices, and then we rotate it so that all the blues end up where reds were. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices in the original must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Or, more precisely, the blue set must be a rotated version of the red set. So, the key is that the blue vertices must form a rotationally equivalent set to the red vertices.

But let's think about how the octagon can be rotated. The octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning there are 8 possible rotations (including the identity rotation by 0 degrees). For each rotation, we can check if the set of blue vertices maps exactly to the set of red vertices.

Wait, but actually, the condition is that there exists some rotation such that the blue vertices after rotation are exactly the red vertices. So, for a given coloring, we need to check if the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

But how do we count the number of colorings that satisfy this condition?

Hmm, perhaps it's useful to think in terms of group theory and Burnside's lemma, but I'm not too familiar with that. Alternatively, maybe we can model this problem using the concept of rotational symmetry.

Let me think. Each vertex can be colored red or blue. The total number of colorings is 2^8 =
