Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

So numerator is x y z, denominator is x² y² z². So the entire product is (x y z) / (x² y² z²) = 1/(x y z). 

So left side is 1/(x y z).

Right side: 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute the exponent:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12

1/3 = 4/12

1/4 = 3/12

So sum is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 over 12, so 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12).

Putting it together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies that x y z = 2^(-13/12)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me denote that as equation (4):

x y z = 2^(-13/12)  ...(4)

Now, I can use equation (4) together with the original three equations to solve for x, y, z individually.

Looking back at equation (1a): x/(y z) = 2^(1/2)

From equation (4), x y z = 2^(-13/12). So y z = (x y z)/x = (2^(-13/12))/x.

Substitute into equation (1a):

x / (y z) = x / [ (2^(-13/12))/x ] = x² / 2^(-13/12) = 2^(1/2)

So x² = 2^(1/2) * 2^(-13/12) = 2^( (6/12) - (13/12) ) = 2^(-7/12)

Therefore, x² = 2^(-7/12) → x = [2^(-7/12)]^(1/2) = 2^(-7/24)

Hmm, but wait, 2^(-7/24) is positive, so that's fine since x is positive.

So x = 2^(-7/24)

Similarly, let's find y. Let's use equation (2a): y/(x z) = 2^(1/3)

Again, from equation (4), x z = (x y z)/y = (2^(-13/12))/y

So equation (2a) becomes:

y / (x z) = y / [ (2^(-13/12))/y ] = y² / 2^(-13/12) = 2^(1/3)

So y² = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-13/12) = 2^( (4/12) - (13/12) ) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)

Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8)

Wait, because square both sides: y² = 2^(-3/4). So y = sqrt(2^(-3/4)) = 2^(-3/8)

Similarly, let's find z using equation (3a): z/(x y) = 2^(1/4)

From equation (4), x y = (x y z)/z = (2^(-13/12))/z

So equation (3a) becomes:

z/(x y) = z / [ (2^(-13/12))/z ] = z² / 2^(-13/12) = 2^(1/4)

So z² = 2^(1/4) * 2^(-13/12) = 2^( (3/12) - (13/12) ) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Thus, z = 2^(-5/12)

Wait, because sqrt of 2^(-5/6) is 2^(-5/12)

So now I have expressions for x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2.

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me check if these satisfy equation (4): x y z.

Compute x y z:

= [2^(-7/24)] * [2^(-3/8)] * [2^(-5/12)]

= 2^( (-7/24) + (-3/8) + (-5/12) )

Convert all to 24 denominators:

-7/24 + (-9/24) + (-10/24) = (-26/24) = (-13/12)

Which is 2^(-13/12), which matches equation (4). Perfect, so that's consistent.

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Let's compute this.

First, compute x⁴ y³ z².

x^4 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-7/6)

y^3 = [2^(-3/8)]^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z^2 = [2^(-5/12)]^2 = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them together:

x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Add the exponents:

-7/6 - 9/8 -5/6

Let me convert all to 24 denominators:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

So total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8

So x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)

Therefore, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8

So m is 25, n is 8. Are they coprime? 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1. So yes, m=25, n=8.

Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with x = 2^(-7/24). So x^4 is 2^(-7/24 *4)=2^(-7/6). Correct.

y = 2^(-3/8), y^3 is 2^(-9/8). Correct.

z=2^(-5/12), z^2 =2^(-5/6). Correct.

Adding exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Convert to 24ths:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24= -25/8. Correct.

So log₂(...) is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So yes, m + n is 33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\)

Multiplying all three equations together, we get:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{1}{x y z}
\]

The right side simplifies to:

\[
2^{(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4)} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Thus, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{x y z} = 2^{13/12} \implies x y z = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Next, we solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) individually. Using the equations:

1. \(x = y z \cdot 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(y = x z \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(z = x y \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

We substitute and solve for each variable:

- For \(x\): \(x^2 = 2^{-7/12} \implies x = 2^{-7/24}\)
- For \(y\): \(y^2 = 2^{-3/4} \implies y = 2^{-3/8}\)
- For \(z\): \(z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12}\)

We then compute \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \quad y^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \quad z^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]

Multiplying these together:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-(7/6 + 9/8 + 5/6)}
\]

Converting to a common denominator (24):

\[
7/6 = 28/24, \quad 9/8 = 27/24, \quad 5/6 = 20/24
\]

Summing these:

\[
28/24 + 27/24 + 20/24 = 75/24 = 25/8
\]

Thus:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Taking the logarithm:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

The absolute value is:

\[
\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
