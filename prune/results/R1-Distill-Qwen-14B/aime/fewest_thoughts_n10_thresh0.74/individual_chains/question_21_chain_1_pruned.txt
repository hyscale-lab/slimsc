Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. So, a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is at least 0 and at most b-1.

So, n = a*b + c. The two digits are a and c, so their sum is a + c. According to the problem, this sum equals sqrt(n). So, we have the equation:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let me rearrange the equation:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can group terms differently. Let me collect like terms:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, for each b, I can try to find all possible c such that the equation has integer solutions for a.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of c. Let's see. Since a must be a positive integer less than b, perhaps for each c, I can solve for a.

But maybe another approach: Let's denote s = a + c, so s = sqrt(n). Then, n = s², and n is also equal to a*b + c. So:

s² = a*b + c

But since s = a + c, we can write c = s - a. Substitute that into the equation:

s² = a*b + (s - a)

Simplify:

s² = a*b + s - a

Bring all terms involving a to one side:

s² - s = a*b - a

Factor out a on the right:

s² - s = a*(b - 1)

So, a = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Since a must be a positive integer less than b, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer between 1 and b-1 inclusive.

Also, since c = s - a, c must be a non-negative integer less than b. So c >= 0 and c < b.

So, for each b, we can try different s values and see if a is an integer in the right range.

But perhaps it's better to express b in terms of a and c. Let me think.

Wait, from s² = a*b + c, and s = a + c, so substituting:

(a + c)² = a*b + c

Expanding:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Rearranging:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = a*b

So,

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c)/a

Simplify:

b = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, (c² - c) must be divisible by a. So, a divides (c² - c). 

But a and c are related because s = a + c, so perhaps for a given b, I can consider possible a and c pairs.

But maybe it's more efficient to think about the possible values of s. Since s is the square root of n, which is an integer, s must be a positive integer. Also, n is a two-digit number in base b, which means it's between b and b² - 1. So:

b ≤ n ≤ b² - 1

Since n = s², so:

b ≤ s² ≤ b² - 1

Taking square roots:

sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ sqrt(b² - 1)

But sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1. Because, for example, when b=2,
