Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). That means the magnitude of \( z \) is 4. Hmm, complex numbers can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can break this down.

First, I remember that for any complex number \( z \), if \( |z| = r \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{r^2} \), where \( \overline{z} \) is the complex conjugate of \( z \). That might come in handy here. So since \( |z| = 4 \), \( |1/z| = 1/4 \).

Let me write \( z \) in its polar form. Let’s say \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That makes sense because the magnitude is 4, so the polar form is straightforward.

So substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). 

Now, let me write the given expression:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]

Substituting \( z \) and \( 1/z \):

\[
(75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplify each term:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). Let me compute \( 75 \times 4 = 300 \) and \( 117 \times 4 = 468 \), so the first term becomes \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \). So the second term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression now is:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

I need to find the real part of this expression and then maximize it. Let me denote \( A = 300 + 468i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \), so the expression becomes \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \).

The real part of this will be the real parts of each term added together. Let me compute each term's real part.

I know that for a complex number \( C \), \( C e^{i\theta} = (Re(C) + Im(C)i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \). The real part is \( Re(C)\cos\theta - Im(C)\sin\theta \).

Similarly, for \( B e^{-i\theta} \), it's \( Re(B)\cos\theta + Im(B)\sin\theta \), because \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \), so multiplying by B:

\( (Re(B) + Im(B)i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = Re(B)\cos\theta + Im(B)\sin\theta + i(-Re(B)\sin\theta + Im(B)\cos\theta) \). So the real part is \( Re(B)\cos\theta + Im(B)\sin\theta \).

So putting it all together, the real part of the entire expression is:

\( [Re(A)\cos\theta - Im(A)\sin\theta] + [Re(B)\cos\theta + Im(B)\sin\theta] \)

Let me compute each part:

Re(A) = 300, Im(A) = 468, Re(B)=24, Im(B)=36.

So:

Real Part = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)

Combine like terms:

= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression, which is a linear combination of cosθ and sinθ. I remember that expressions of the form \( a \cosθ + b \sinθ \) can be rewritten as \( R \cos(θ - φ) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( φ = \arctan(b/a) \) (or something like that, depending on the signs). So the maximum value of this expression is R, because the maximum of cosine is 1.

Wait, but in this case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So let me write it as:

R cos(θ + φ), but the exact form might vary. Let me compute R.

So R is sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 )

Calculate 324^2: 324 * 324. Let's compute:

300^2 = 90000,

24^2 = 576,

and 2*300*24 = 14400.

So 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 90000 +14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let me compute 400^2 = 160000,

32^2=1024,

2*400*32=25600.

So 432^2 = (400 +32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000 +25600=185600 +1024=186,624.

So R = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291,600).

What is sqrt(291600)? Hmm, sqrt(291600) = sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916)*10. What is sqrt(2916)?

Well, sqrt(2916) is 54, because 54^2=2916. Let me check: 50^2=2500, 55^2=3025, so 54^2=2916, yes. So sqrt(2916)=54. Therefore, sqrt(291600)=540.

So R=540.

Therefore, the expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ can be written as 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is some angle. The maximum value of this expression is 540, since the maximum of cosine is 1.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sign. Because it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as R cos(θ + φ), right? Because cos(θ + φ) = cosθ cosφ - sinθ sinφ. So comparing to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, that would be R cosφ = 324 and R sinφ = 432. So then, tanφ = (432)/(324) = 432/324. Simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 108: 432 ÷108=4, 324 ÷108=3. So tanφ=4/3. So φ=arctan(4/3). But regardless, the maximum value is R, which is 540.

Alternatively, if I write it as R cos(θ - φ'), where φ' is an angle such that cosφ' = 324/R and sinφ' = 432/R, then the maximum would still be R.

Yes, that seems right. So the maximum value is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540. So I think that's the answer.


The given expression is \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). We express \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), so \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\). Substituting these into the expression, we rewrite it as:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

The real part of this expression is:

\[
324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta
\]

This can be rewritten as \(540 \cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540\). The maximum value of this expression is thus \(540\).

The largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
