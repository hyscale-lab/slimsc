Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's try to break it down.

First, I know that when dealing with equations involving multiple variables and sums, sometimes it helps to look for symmetries or ways to factor expressions. The second equation looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it somehow or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Let me write down the two equations again:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are two of the variables a, b, c. So maybe I can factor this expression.

Wait, if I factor a²b + a²c, that's a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So the entire second equation can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Since from the first equation, we know that a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That's a start. Let me denote this as equation (2').

So now, equation (2') is:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let's see.

Wait, 300a² - a³ is equal to a²(300 - a). Similarly for the other terms. But we already did that substitution, so maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express equation (2') in terms of the first equation.

Since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can relate a²b + a²c + ... to some symmetric function. Let me think about symmetric polynomials.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor the second equation in terms of (a + b + c). Let me try that.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Notice that this is equal to ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c). Hmm, that might be useful.

So, the second equation can be written as:

ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = 6,000,000.

But from the first equation, we know that a + b = 300 - c, a + c = 300 - b, and b + c = 300 - a. So substituting these into the expression:

ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute each term:

ab*300 - ab c + ac*300 - a c b + bc*300 - b c a = 6,000,000.

Simplify each term:

300ab - abc + 300ac - abc + 300bc - abc = 6,000,000.

Combine like terms:

300ab + 300ac + 300bc - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Factor out 300 from the first three terms:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

So now, I have a new equation:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000. Let's call this equation (3).

So now, we have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300. (Equation 1)
2. 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000. (Equation 3)

Hmm, this seems more manageable. Now, maybe I can find a way to express this in terms of symmetric sums.

Let me denote s = a + b + c = 300.

Let me denote p = ab + ac + bc.

And let me denote q = abc.

So, equation 3 becomes:

100p - q = 2,000,000.

So, 100p - q = 2,000,000 => q = 100p - 2,000,000.

Now, in terms of symmetric polynomials, we know that for three variables a, b, c, the elementary symmetric sums are s = a + b + c, p = ab + bc + ac, and q = abc.

So, if I can find some relationship between s, p, and q, maybe I
