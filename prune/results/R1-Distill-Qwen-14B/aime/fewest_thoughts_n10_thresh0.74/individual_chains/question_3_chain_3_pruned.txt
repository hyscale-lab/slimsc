Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.

So, the setup is that Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. If all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize.

The question is about conditional probability. Specifically, we need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, conditional probability. That means I need to find the probability of the grand prize event (all four numbers matching) given that the prize event (at least two numbers matching) has occurred.

Mathematically, this is P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize and Prize) / P(Prize). But since if she wins the grand prize, she definitely won a prize, the intersection is just the grand prize. So this simplifies to P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize).

So, my goal is to compute P(Grand Prize) and P(Prize), then divide them.

Let me figure out how to compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of possible ways the lottery can be drawn. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). I'll calculate that later, but let's note that.

Now, P(Grand Prize). How many ways can Jen win the grand prize? Well, she has to pick exactly the same 4 numbers as the lottery. Since she's picking 4 numbers, and the lottery is also picking 4, there's only one specific combination that gives the grand prize. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(Grand Prize) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, actually, no. Wait. Wait a minute—no, that's not correct. Because in reality, since Jen is picking 4 numbers, and the lottery is picking 4 numbers, the probability that they match exactly is 1 / C(10,4). So, yes, that's correct.

Now, P(Prize). This is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are among the four chosen. So, the prize is awarded if she has 2, 3, or 4 matching numbers. So, the probability is the sum of the probabilities of exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 matches.

So, to compute P(Prize) = P(2 matches) + P(3 matches) + P(4 matches). So, I need to calculate each of these.

Let me recall that the number of ways to choose k matching numbers from Jen's 4 numbers is C(4,k), and the number of ways to choose the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the non-Jen numbers, which are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers. So, for exactly k matches, the number of favorable combinations is C(4,k) * C(6, 4 - k). Therefore, the probability is [C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k)] / C(10,4).

So, let's compute each term.

First, for k=4 (the grand prize):
C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1. So, P(4 matches) = 1 / C(10,4).

For k=3:
C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24. So, P(3 matches) = 24 / C(10,4).

For k=2:
C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90. So, P(2 matches) = 90 / C(10,4).

Therefore, P(Prize) = (1 + 24 + 90) / C(10,4) = 115 / C(10,4).

Wait, let me check my math. 1 (for k=4) + 24 (k=3) + 90 (k=2) = 115. And the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4) = 210.

So, P(Prize) = 115 / 210.

Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, 23/42 is the probability of winning a prize.

And P(Grand Prize) is 1 / 210.

So, the conditional probability P(Grand Prize | Prize) is (1 / 210) / (115 / 210) = (1 / 210) * (210 / 115) )= 1 / 115.

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check.

Wait, P(Grand Prize) is 1 / 210, because there's only one winning combination out of 210 possible.

P(Prize) is the probability that she has at least two matches, which is (as we computed) 115 / 210.

Therefore, the conditional probability is (1 / 210) / (115 / 210) = 1/115.

So, m/n is 1/115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, since 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors besides
