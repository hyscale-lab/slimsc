Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

Alright, the total number of residents is 900. Each of them owns at least a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal here. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. 

The counts given are:
- Diamond rings: 195
- Golf clubs: 367
- Garden spades: 562

Additionally, 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four—candy hearts, diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that when dealing with sets and their overlaps, the principle of inclusion-exclusion is useful. But here, since each person owns at least candy hearts, which is the fourth item, I need to adjust my approach.

Wait, let me think. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's the universal set. The other three items are subsets of this universal set. So, the problem is about the overlaps between these three subsets—diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades.

We also know that 437 own exactly two of the four items, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things. Wait, but the four things include candy hearts. So, if someone owns exactly two, does that include candy hearts? Or is it two of the other three? Hmm, the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous, but I think it refers to exactly two of the four. Wait, but since everyone owns candy hearts, it's more likely that the two refers to the other three items. Let me check.

Wait, the problem states: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, they all own at least that. So, when it says "exactly two of these things," does it include candy hearts? Let's think. If someone owns exactly two, it would have to include candy hearts because they can't not own it. So, for example, someone could own candy hearts and a diamond ring. That would be two items. So, the 437 own exactly two things, which includes candy hearts. Similarly, the 234 own exactly three, which would also include candy hearts. So, that's important.

So, in terms of set theory, let's denote the sets as follows:
- Let A be the set of residents who own a diamond ring.
- Let B be the set who own a golf club.
- Let C be the set who own a garden spade.
- Let D be the set who own candy hearts (but since everyone owns this, D is the universal set.)

So, the problem is about the overlaps between A, B, and C, with the universal set being D, which has 900 elements.

We know:
- |A| = 195
- |B| = 367
- |C| = 562
- |A ∩ B ∩ C| = x (this is what we need to find)
- The number of people owning exactly two of the four items is 437, which includes those owning exactly two of A, B, C, plus D. Wait, but since D is universal, if someone owns exactly two, it's D plus one other thing. Because they have to own D. So, owning exactly two would mean owning D and exactly one other item.

Wait, that's an important point. So, the 437 residents who own exactly two things must mean they own candy hearts and exactly one of A, B, or C. So, they are in the intersections of two sets, where one is D and the other is A, B, or C.

Similarly, the 234 residents who own exactly three things would be owning D and exactly two of A, B, C. So, they're in the intersection
