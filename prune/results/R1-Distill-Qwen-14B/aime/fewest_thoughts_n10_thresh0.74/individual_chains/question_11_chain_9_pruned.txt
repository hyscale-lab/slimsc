Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that since |z| = 4, z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. So z can be represented as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That makes sense because the modulus is 4, and the argument θ can vary from 0 to 2π.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because |1/z| = 1/|z| = 1/4, and the argument is the negative of θ.

Now, let's substitute z and 1/z into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * z + (96 + 144i) / z

Substituting z = 4e^{iθ} and 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}, we get:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i) * e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) * e^{-iθ}

So the entire expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}

Hmm, I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me denote A = 75 + 117i and B = 24 + 36i. So the expression is 4*A*e^{iθ} + B*e^{-iθ}.

To find the real part, I can write each term as a complex number in terms of cosine and sine.

Recall that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's compute each part:

First, 4*A*e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ)

Multiply this out:

= 4*[75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i^2 sinθ]

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

= 4*[75 cosθ + i (75 sinθ + 117 cosθ) - 117 sinθ]

Simplify:

= 4*[75 cosθ - 117 sinθ + i (75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)]

Similarly, the second term: B*e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)*(cosθ - i sinθ)

Multiply this out:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

= [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ] + i [ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ ]

Now, let's collect the real parts from both terms.

The first term's real part is 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) = 4*75 cosθ - 4*117 sinθ = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

The second term's real part is (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ).

So combining both, the total real part is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

Calculating the coefficients:

300 + 24 = 324

-468 + 36 = -432

So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I need to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude, and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is R.

So let's compute R. R is sqrt(a^2 + b^2), where a = 324 and b = -432.

Wait, actually, a is 324, and b is -432. So R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2).

Let me compute 324^2 and 432^2.

324^2: 324 * 324. Let's compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So (300+24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 000 + 14400 is 104400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2=1024, cross term 2*400*32=25600. So (400+32)^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 185,624.

Wait, no, 400^2 is 160,000; 32^2 is 1,024. 2*400*32 = 25,600. So 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check 432^2.

432 * 432: Let's compute 400*400=160,000; 400*32=12,800; 32*400=12,800; 32*32=1,024. So (400+32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. Yes, that's correct.

So R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Let me compute 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2=250,000; 540^2 = (500+40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So R = 540.

So the real part is 540 cos(θ + φ), and the maximum value is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ = R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = 540. So yes, the maximum value is 540.

So the largest possible real part is 540.

But wait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check the steps.

Starting with z on the circle |z|=4, so z=4e^{iθ}.

Then, the expression is (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z.

Substituting z=4e^{iθ}, we get (75+117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = 4*(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Then, expanding both terms, taking real parts:

First term's real part: 4*(75 cosθ -117 sinθ) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Second term's real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Adding them together: 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Which is of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, where A=324, B=-432.

The maximum is sqrt(A² + B²) = sqrt(324² + 432²) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. So yes, that seems correct.

I think that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a way
