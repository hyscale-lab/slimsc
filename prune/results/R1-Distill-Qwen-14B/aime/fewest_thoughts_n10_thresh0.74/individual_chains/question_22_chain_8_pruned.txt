Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me visualize the hexagon. It's convex and equilateral, so all its sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel, which probably means it's something like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or sheared in some way. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is a type of parallelogon, I think. But it's equilateral, so all sides are the same length.

Now, the triangle mentioned is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I imagine extending these three sides, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. That must mean that the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle in some way. Each of these extended sides is a side of the triangle, so the hexagon is kind of fitting into the triangle by having its sides lie along extensions of the triangle's sides.

Wait, no, actually, the hexagon is such that when you extend AB, CD, and EF, you get a triangle. So, perhaps the hexagon is kind of a truncated version of the triangle? Or maybe it's a hexagon that's created by cutting off three corners of the triangle.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but scaled in certain directions. But the triangle formed has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me note that 200, 240, 300 is a Pythagorean triplet because 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600, and 300² is 90000... Wait, no, that's not right. 200² + 240² is 40000 + 57600 = 97600, and 300² is 90000. Hmm, that's not equal, so maybe it's not a right triangle. Wait, but 200:240:300 simplifies to 10:12:15 when divided by 20. So it's a triangle with sides 10, 12, 15, scaled up by 20.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 3-4-5 triangle scaled up? 3-4-5 is 3²+4²=5². 10-12-15 is 10²=100, 12²=144, 15²=225. 100+144=244 ≠225, so no. So not a right triangle. So it's a scalene triangle.

I think
