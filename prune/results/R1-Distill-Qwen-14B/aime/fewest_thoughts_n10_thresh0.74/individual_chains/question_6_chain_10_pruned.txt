Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many times the graphs of two functions intersect. The functions are given as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let's understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both are absolute value functions with some transformations. Maybe I should graph these to get an idea of their shapes.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The absolute value of x, |x|, is a V-shaped graph. Then subtracting 1/2 from that would shift the graph down by 1/2 unit, but since it's inside another absolute value, that might change things. Let me think. If I have |x| - 1/2, that's a V shifted down, but then taking the absolute value of that would reflect any negative parts back up. So the graph of f(x) would have a W shape maybe? Or perhaps two Vs? Let me sketch it out mentally.

At x = 0: f(0) = ||0| - 1/2| = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. As x increases, |x| increases, so |x| - 1/2 becomes positive once |x| > 1/2. For |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so the absolute value makes it 1/2 - |x|. So f(x) is a V shape that peaks at 1/2, goes down to 0 at |x|=1/2, and then goes back up. Wait, actually, no, because if |x| is greater than 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So it's a V shape that has a minimum at |x|=1/2, f(x) = 0, and then increases linearly on either side. So the graph of f(x) is an upside-down V centered at x=0, with the bottom at (0, 1/2), going down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), then up again.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's think about this. Same idea: |x| - 1/4 is subtracted, then absolute value is taken. So for |x| < 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is negative, so g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. So the graph of g(x) is an upside-down V with a peak at (0, 1/4), going down to (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0), then up again.

So both f and g are similar functions but with different shifts. Now, the functions y and x in the problem involve compositions of these functions with sine and cosine functions inside. So let's look at the given functions:

First function: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
Second function: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

I need to find how many times these two graphs intersect. That means I need to find all pairs (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied.

Wait, but the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), which is x expressed in terms of y. So, this is similar to a system of equations where each equation defines a relationship between x and y, and we're looking for points (x,y) that satisfy both.

But since both equations involve these composite functions, it's going to be a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down.

Let me first consider each function separately and see what their ranges and periods are.

Starting with y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's parse this.

The innermost function is sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 2π, but with the argument 2πx, the period becomes 1. So sin(2πx) has a period of 1. Its range is [-1, 1].

Then, f is applied: f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Let's consider the range of |sin(2πx)|. Since sin(2πx
