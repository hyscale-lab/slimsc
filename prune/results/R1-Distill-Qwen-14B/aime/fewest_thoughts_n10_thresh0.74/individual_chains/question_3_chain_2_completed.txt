Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the setup: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. 

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. 

Wait, but if she wins the grand prize, she must have at least two numbers matching, right? Because winning the grand prize means all four numbers match, which definitely satisfies the condition for winning a prize. So, A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), since A is a subset of B. 

So, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B). 

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins a prize. 

Let me structure this:

1. Compute P(A): Probability of winning the grand prize.
2. Compute P(B): Probability of winning a prize (i.e., at least two numbers match).
3. Divide P(A) by P(B) to get the conditional probability.
4. Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms and find m + n.

Starting with step 1: P(A). 

How many ways are there for the lottery to pick 4 numbers? That's the combination of 10 numbers taken 4 at a time, which is C(10,4). 

Jen wins the grand prize if the 4 numbers she picked are exactly the ones drawn. Since she picks 4 distinct numbers, there's only one favorable outcome (the exact set she picked). So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. 

Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4). 

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Moving on to step 2: Compute P(B). 

P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are among the four drawn. 

Hmm, sometimes it's easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of "at least two" is "zero or one" matches. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match).

Let me compute P(zero matches) and P(exactly one match):

First, P(zero matches): The number of ways to choose 4 numbers none of which are Jen's. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). 

So, P(zero matches) = C(6,4) / C(10,4). 

Calculating C(6,4): 15. So, P(zero matches) = 15/210 = 1/14.

Next, P(exactly one match): This is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen. 

To compute this, we can think of it as choosing 1 number from Jen's 4, and then 3 numbers from the remaining 6. 

Number of favorable outcomes: C(4,1) * C(6,3). 

Calculating that: C(4,1) = 4; C(6,3) = 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. 

Therefore, P(exactly one match) = 80 / 210. 

Simplify that: 80/210 = 8/21.

Now, putting it together: 

P(B) = 1 - P(zero) - P(one) = 1 - (1/14) - (8/21).

Let me convert these to a common denominator to subtract. The denominators are 14 and 21, so the least common multiple is 42.

1 = 42/42, 1/14 = 3/42, 8/21 = 16/42.

So, P(B) = 42/42 - 3/42 -16/42 = (42 -3 -16)/42 = 23/42.

Wait, let me check that calculation:

42 -3 is 39, 39 -16 is 23. So yes, 23/42.

Wait, but 1/14 is 3/42, and 8/21 is 16/42. So 3 + 16 is 19, 42 -19 is 23. So yes, 23/42.

So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check:

Wait, the total number of possible ways is 210. 

Number of ways for zero matches: C(6,4)=15.

Number of ways for exactly one match: C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80.

So, the number of ways for at least two matches is total - zero - one = 210 -15 -80= 115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, 115/210 can be simplified. Let's see: 115 divides by 5 (23*5), 210 is 42*5=210. So, 115/210 = 23/42. So that's correct.

Wait, but 23/42 is approximately 0.5476, which seems reasonable because the probability of at least two matches is more than 50%.

But let me think again: 210 total combinations.

Number of ways for two matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). Let me compute that.

C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. So 6*15=90.

Number of ways for three matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

Number of ways for four matches: C(4,4)=1.

So, total for at least two matches is 90 +24 +1=115. So yes, 115/210=23/42.

So, P(B)=23/42.

Wait, but earlier, P(A) is 1/210. So, the probability we're looking for is (1/210)/(23/42).

Let me compute that:

(1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23).

Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times (since 42*5=210). So, 42/210 = 1/5.

So, that becomes (1/5) /23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, so the probability is 1/115.

Is that correct? Let me double-check.

P(A) = 1/210.

P(B) = 23/42.

So, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (42)/(4830) = simplifying.

Wait, 42 divides into 4830: 4830 /42 = 115. So, 42/4830 =1/115.

Yes, correct.

So, the probability is 1/115.

So, m=1, n=115. Are they coprime? 1 and 115 share no common divisors besides 1.

Therefore, m +n=1+115=116.

So, the answer is 116.

Wait, but just to make sure, is 1/115 the correct conditional probability?

Alternative approach: Using counts.

Total number of possible 4-number combinations: 210.

Number of combinations where Jen wins a prize: 115.

Number of combinations where she wins the grand prize: 1.

So, the conditional probability is 1/115. That makes sense.

Yes, that's consistent.

Therefore, I think the answer is 116.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we compute \( P(A|B) \), with \( A \) being the event of winning the grand prize and \( B \) being the event of winning a prize.

1. **Compute \( P(A) \):**  
   The probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. There is only one favorable outcome out of \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \) possible combinations.  
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
   \]

2. **Compute \( P(B) \):**  
   The probability of winning a prize (at least two matches) is calculated by subtracting the probabilities of zero and one match from 1.  
   - **Zero matches:** Choose 4 numbers from the 6 not picked by Jen.  
     \[
     P(\text{zero matches}) = \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14}
     \]
   - **Exactly one match:** Choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6.  
     \[
     P(\text{one match}) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21}
     \]
   - **Total probability of at least two matches:**  
     \[
     P(B) = 1 - P(\text{zero}) - P(\text{one}) = 1 - \frac{1}{14} - \frac{8}{21} = \frac{23}{42}
     \]

3. **Compute \( P(A|B) \):**  
   Using the conditional probability formula:  
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{116}
\]
