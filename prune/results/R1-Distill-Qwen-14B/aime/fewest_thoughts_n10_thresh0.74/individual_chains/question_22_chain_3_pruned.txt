Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF. There's also a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. An equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles can vary. But in this case, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which probably gives it some regularity in shape, but I'm not sure.

First, I remember that in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the sides can be grouped into three pairs of opposite sides. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Since it's equilateral, each of these sides has the same length, which I'll call 's'.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about how that would look. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, these lines should meet at some points forming a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

Wait, so AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, each of length 's'. When extended, these lines form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate the lengths of these sides to the side length 's' of the hexagon.

I recall that in such hexagons, the sides can be considered as being part of a larger triangle, and the side lengths of the triangle are related to the hexagon's sides and some scaling factors.

Maybe I can model the hexagon as being inside this larger triangle, with each pair of opposite sides cutting off smaller similar triangles from the larger one.

Let me try to think of this: when you extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. So, each of these sides is a part of this larger triangle. The hexagon is inscribed within this triangle, with each side being parallel to the corresponding side of the larger triangle.

Wait, but the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, so perhaps the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric figure within the triangle.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is divided by the hexagon into smaller similar triangles. Each extension of a side of the hexagon cuts off a smaller triangle from the larger one.

Let me consider the triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. Let's denote it as triangle XYZ, where XY = 200, YZ = 240, and XZ = 300. But wait, I should check if this triangle is valid. The sum of any two sides should be greater than the third.

200 + 240 = 440 > 300, yes. 200 + 300 = 500 > 240, yes. 240 + 300
