Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help here. Let me write down the given equations first.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Using logarithm properties, log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So this can be rewritten as x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same property, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10

2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to simplify things. Let's say log_x(y) = k. Then log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So substituting into the equations:

Equation 1: x * k = 10

Equation 2: 4y * (1/k) = 10

So now I have:

xk = 10 ...(1)

(4y)/k = 10 ...(2)

I can solve equation (1) for x: x = 10 / k.

Similarly, from equation (2), I can solve for y: 4y = 10k → y = (10k) / 4 = (5k)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k. Let me write that down:

x = 10 / k

y = (5k) / 2

But wait, I also know that log_x(y) = k. Since I have expressions for x and y in terms of k, maybe I can express log_x(y) in terms of k and then set it equal to k to solve for k.

Let me recall that log_x(y) = ln(y) / ln(x). Alternatively, using the change of base formula.

So log_x(y) = ln(y) / ln(x) = k.

But since I have y in terms of k and x in terms of k, I can substitute those in.

So let's plug in x = 10/k and y = (5k)/2 into log_x(y):

log_{10/k} (5k/2) = k

Hmm, that might be a bit complicated, but let's try to express this logarithm in terms of natural logs or maybe another base.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the definition of logarithm. log_x(y) = k implies that x^k = y.

Wait, that's another logarithm property: if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a.

So, from log_x(y) = k, we have x^k = y.

But I already have expressions for x and y in terms of k.

From above, x = 10 / k and y = (5k)/2.

So, according to this, x^k should equal y.

Substituting, (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

So, (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that's an equation involving k. Let's write that down.

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

This looks a bit tricky. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln[(10/k)^k] = ln[(5k)/2].

Using the power rule for logarithms, ln(a^b) = b ln a:

k * ln(10/k) = ln(5k/2).

Let me expand ln(10/k):

ln(10) - ln(k). So,

k*(ln(10) - ln(k)) = ln(5k/2).

Similarly, expand the right-hand side:

ln(5k/2) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2) = ln(5) - ln(2) + ln(k).

So putting it all together:

k*(ln(10) - ln(k)) = ln(5) - ln(2) + ln(k).

Let me rearrange this equation to collect terms involving ln(k):

k * ln(10) - k * ln(k) = ln(5) - ln(2) + ln(k).

Bring all terms to one side:

k * ln(10) - k * ln(k) - ln(5) + ln(2) - ln(k) = 0.

Factor out ln(k) from the terms that have it:

k * ln(10) - ln(k)*(k + 1) - (ln(5) - ln(2)) = 0.

Hmm, this equation is looking complicated. It's a transcendental equation, which might not have an algebraic solution. Perhaps I need to find a value of k that satisfies this equation through testing or estimation.

Let me think about possible integer values of k that might work. Since x and y are greater than 1, and from the initial equations, x and y are likely to be integers or nice fractions.

Wait, let's test k=2.

If k=2, let's substitute back into the equation:

Left side: 2*(ln(10) - ln(2)) = 2*(ln(10/2)) = 2*ln(5) ≈ 2*1.6094 ≈ 3.2188.

Right side: ln(5) - ln(2) + ln(2) = ln(5) ≈ 1.6094.

Wait, that's not equal. So 2*ln(5) ≈3.2188 ≠ ln(5) ≈1.6094.

So k=2 is not a solution.

Let's try k=1.

But k=1 would give log_x(y)=1,
