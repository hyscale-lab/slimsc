Okay, I have this problem here where I need to find the product of x and y, given that both are real numbers greater than 1. The conditions are that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, okay, so let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but there are some properties I can use. Let me write down what I know:

log_x(y^x) = 10
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I also know that both x and y are greater than 1, which is important because it tells me that the logarithms will be defined and positive, I think.

Let me start by trying to simplify each equation using logarithm rules. I remember that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that here.

For the first equation, log_x(y^x) would simplify to x * log_x(y). And that equals 10. So:

x * log_x(y) = 10

Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) would become 4y * log_y(x). So:

4y * log_y(x) = 10

Now I have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10
2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. I need to find x and y, and then their product. Let me think about how these equations relate.

I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So maybe I can use that relationship here. Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So, substituting into the equations:

1) x * A = 10
2) 4y * (1/A) = 10

Now I have a system of two equations with two variables, x and y, but also involving A. Hmm, I can try to express x and y in terms of A.

From equation 1: x = 10 / A

From equation 2: 4y / A = 10 => 4y = 10A => y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of A:

x = 10/A
y = 5A/2

Now I can plug these into each other. Since A is log_x(y), which is log base x of y.

But wait, let me think about A. A is log_x(y) = log(y)/log(x), using the change of base formula. Since we might be working with natural logs or common logs, but the base doesn't matter as long as we're consistent.

But actually, since x and y are expressed in terms of A, maybe I can write A in terms of A itself. Let me try.

We have A = log_x(y). Using the change of base formula, that's log(y) / log(x).

But I have x and y in terms of A:

x = 10/A, so log(x) = log(10/A) = log(10) - log(A)

Similarly, y = (5A)/2, so log(y) = log(5A/2) = log(5) + log(A) - log(2)

So A = [log(y)] / [log(x)] = [log(5) + log(A) - log(2)] / [log(10) - log(A)]

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me write that equation again.

A = [log(5) + log(A) - log(2)] / [log(10) - log(A)]

Hmm, maybe I can simplify this equation to solve for A.

Let me denote log(10) as L, just to make it easier. Wait, log(10) is 1 if we're using base 10, but wait, the base isn't specified here, so actually, I should be using natural logs or another base. Hmm, but since we're dealing with logarithms in different bases, maybe it's better to use natural logs for consistency.

Wait, maybe I can write it in terms of natural logarithms. Let me try that.

So, A = [ln(y)] / [ln(x)]

We have y = (5A)/2 and x = 10/A, so:

A = [ln(5A/2)] / [ln(10/A)]

So, A = [ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)] / [ln(10) - ln(A)]

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator.

So, A * [ln(10) - ln(A)] = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Let me expand the left side:

A * ln(10) - A * ln(A) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Hmm, I can bring all terms to one side:

A * ln(10) - A * ln(A) - ln(5) - ln(A) + ln(2) = 0

Let me factor out the terms with ln(A):

A * ln(10) - (A + 1) * ln(A) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

A * ln(10) - (A + 1) * ln(A) = ln(5) - ln(2)

Wait, ln(5) - ln(2) is ln(5/2), so:

A * ln(10) - (A + 1) * ln(A) = ln(5/2)

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can factor A out of some terms.

Let's see:

A * ln(10) - A * ln(A) - ln(A) = ln(5/2)

A [ln(10) - ln(A)] - ln(A) = ln(5/2)

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor differently.

Wait, perhaps I can denote u = ln(A). Then, the equation becomes:

A * ln(10) - (A + 1) * u = ln(5/2)

But since u = ln(A), that's still tricky because A is in terms of u. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can try substituting specific values for A to see if it satisfies the equation. Since this is a problem likely designed to have a nice answer, maybe A is a nice number, like 2 or something.

Let me try A = 2.

Plug A = 2 into the equation:

Left side: 2 * ln(10) - (2 + 1) * ln(2) = 2 ln(10) - 3 ln(2)

What is that numerically? Let's compute:

ln(10) ≈ 2.302585
ln(2) ≈ 0.693147

So, 2 * 2.302585 ≈ 4.60517
3 * 0.693147 ≈ 2.07944

So left side ≈ 4.60517 - 2.07944 ≈ 2.52573

Right side: ln(5/2) = ln(2.5) ≈ 0.916291

Hmm, 2.52573 ≈ 0.916291? No, that's not equal. So A=2 is not a solution.

How about A=3?

Left side: 3 * ln(10) -4 * ln(3)
≈ 3*2.302585 ≈6.907755
4*1.098612≈4.394448

So 6.907755 -4.394448 ≈2.513307

Again, right side is ~0.916. Not matching.

Wait, maybe A is less than 2. Let me try A=1.

Left side: 1*ln(10) -2*ln(1) = ln(10) -0 ≈2.302585

Right side is 0.916... Not equal.

Hmm, maybe A is between 1 and 2.

Let me try A=1.5.

Compute left side:

1.5 * ln(10) =1.5*2.302585≈3.453878

(1.5 +1)=2.5 * ln(1.5) =2.5 *0.405465≈1.013663

So left side: 3.453878 -1.013663≈2.440215

Still higher than 0.916.

Hmm, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in my earlier approach. Let me double-check my equations.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me take the two original equations:

1) x * log_x(y) =10
2)4y * log_y(x)=10

I can write these equations in terms of natural logarithms.

So, equation 1: x * [ln y / ln x] =10

Equation 2:4y * [ln x / ln y] =10

Let me write equation 1 as:

x * (ln y)/(ln x) =10

Equation 2 as:

4y * (ln x)/(ln y) =10

Hmm, perhaps I can denote (ln x)/(ln y) as k. Then, (ln y)/(ln x) would be 1/k.

So, equation 1 becomes x*(1/k)=10 → x=10k

Equation 2 becomes 4y*k=10 → y=10/(4k)=5/(2k)

So, now I have x=10k and y=5/(2k)

But since k=(ln x)/(ln y), let's substitute x and y in terms of k.

k = (ln(10k))/(ln(5/(2k)))

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps manageable.

So, k = [ln(10) + ln(k)] / [ln(5) - ln(2k)]

Which is the same as:

k = [ln(10) + ln(k)] / [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(k)]

Let me denote ln(k) as m. So, m = ln(k), which implies k = e^m.

Substituting:

e^m = [ln(10) + m] / [ln(5) - ln(2) - m]

Hmm, that's a
