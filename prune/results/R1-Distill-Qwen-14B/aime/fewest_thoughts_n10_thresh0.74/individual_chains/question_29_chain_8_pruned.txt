Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Additionally, the points A, D, H, and G all lie on a circle. So, ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let's visualize this. I think it's best to draw a rough sketch to get a sense of the problem. So, I imagine rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. So, AB is 107, BC is 16, which means AD is also 16, and DC is 107. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF is 184, FG is 17, so GH is 17, and HE is 184.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points D and C are from rectangle ABCD, while E and F are from EFGH. Let's think about the positions. Since D and C are consecutive vertices of ABCD, and E and F are vertices of EFGH, they must lie on the same line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F in that order, or some other order. Hmm, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order is D first, then E, then C, then F.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, D is one corner, and C is the next. So, DC is a side of length 107. So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, then E is somewhere between D and C, and F is beyond C. Or maybe E is beyond D, but that might complicate things. Hmm. I think E is between D and C, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to assign coordinates to each point to make this clearer.

Let me assign a coordinate system. Let's place point D at the origin (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16, we can assign coordinates as follows:

- D: (0, 0)
- C: (107, 0) because DC is 107 units long.
- B: (0, 16) because AD is 16 units.
- A: (0, 16), but wait, no. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so if D is at (0,0), then C is at (a, 0), and B would be at (0, b), where a and b are the lengths of DC and AD. Wait, no, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular, so if DC is 107, then AB is 107 as well, and BC is 16, so AD is also 16.

So, let's correctly assign the coordinates:

- Letâ€™s set point D at (0, 0).
- Since DC is 107, point C is at (107, 0).
- Since AD is 16, point A is at (0,16).
- Then, point B, which is diagonally opposite to D, would be at (0,16 + 107)? Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, moving from D to C is along the
