Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis. I think B is at (0, approximately 0.866), since sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

Then there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, these are line segments from some point (p,0) on the x-axis to some point (0,q) on the y-axis, with the distance between them being 1. So, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, right? Because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2). So, for each segment PQ in F, we have p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F because its length is 1, right? Let me check: the distance from A to B is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, so AB is a member of F.

So, F includes all unit segments from (p,0) to (0,q) in the first quadrant, and AB is one such segment. Now, we need to find a point C on AB such that C is only on AB and not on any other segment from F. Then, we have to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p+q.

First, I should probably parametrize the line segment AB. Let's find the equation of AB. Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)*(something). Wait, let me plug in point A: when x = 1/2, y = 0. So, 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b, so b = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t is between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, actually, when t is 1/2, y is 0, which is point A, and when t is 0, y is sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. So, yes, t goes from 0 to 1/2.

Now, point C is on AB, so it's of the form (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2). And we need to find C such that it doesn't lie on any segment PQ from F other than AB.

So, the other segments PQ in F are from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1. Each such segment can be parametrized as (p(1-s), q s), where s ranges from 0 to 1. So, for each PQ, points on it can be written as (p(1-s), q s) for s between 0 and 1.

We need point C to not lie on any such PQ except for AB. So, for any other PQ in F, the equation (t, y(t)) should not satisfy the parametric equations of that PQ, except for when PQ is AB.

So, perhaps, for point C, the only PQ in F that contains it is AB.
