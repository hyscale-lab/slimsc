Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The path goes from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and it has to be exactly length 16. Hmm, wait, an 8x8 grid normally has 9 points along each side, right? So moving from one corner to the opposite would require 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense.

The problem says to find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Oh, right, direction changes happen when you switch from moving right to up or up to right. So each time the path switches, it's a direction change. 

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of straight segments in the path. If a path starts by moving right, then up, then right, then up, and so on. Each switch is a direction change. So, if it changes direction four times, how many straight segments does that correspond to?

Wait, starting direction is, say, right. Then each change of direction alternates the direction. So, if you have four direction changes, that would mean you have five segments. Because each direction change adds a new segment. Let me test with a small number. If you change direction once, you have two segments. Two direction changes, three segments. Yep, so four changes would mean five segments. So, the path is composed of five straight segments, alternating between right and up.

But wait, the starting direction could be either right or up. So, maybe there are two cases: starting with right or starting with up. Each case would lead to a different count, so I might have to consider both.

So, the path will have five segments: alternately right and up. Let me think about the distribution of right and up steps in these segments. Since the total right steps are 8 and up steps are 8, the sum of the lengths of the right segments must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of the up segments must also be 8.

Wait, but since the number of segments is five, and they alternate between right and up, the number of right segments and up segments would differ by one, depending on the starting direction.

If we start with right, then the segments would be: right, up, right, up, right. So
