Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

It's about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA, right? Since it's equilateral, all the sides are equal in length. But I don't know the side length yet; that's what I need to find.

The problem also mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm. Let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and all sides equal. So, it's like a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular because the angles can vary as long as opposite sides are parallel. But in this case, maybe the extensions of these sides form a triangle.

Wait, the sides AB, CD, and EF are being extended to form a triangle. So, if I imagine extending AB beyond B and beyond A, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, these extensions meet to form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300.

I think this triangle must be larger than the hexagon. So the hexagon is inscribed in some way within this triangle.

I remember that in such cases, similar triangles might come into play. Maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to some smaller triangles within the hexagon?

Let me consider the hexagon. Since it's equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it's like a zonogon, but with six sides. In such a hexagon, each pair of opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, AB || DE and AB = DE, BC || EF and BC = EF, CD || FA and CD = FA.

But wait, in this case, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, meaning AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA. But since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon must be what's called a "zonohexagon," but with all sides equal, so maybe a special kind of zonohexagon.

Given that, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about how
