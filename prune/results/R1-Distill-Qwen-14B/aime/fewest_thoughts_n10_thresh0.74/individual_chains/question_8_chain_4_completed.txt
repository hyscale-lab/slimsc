Okay, so I've got this problem here. I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving a, b, c is 6,000,000. The equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

Looking at equation 2, I notice that each term is a product of one variable squared and another variable. So, for example, a²b, a²c, etc. It seems like each pair of variables is multiplied together in such a way.

I wonder if I can factor this expression or rewrite it in a different form. Let's see:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

I can factor out a² from the first two terms: a²(b + c). Similarly, from the next two terms, I can factor out b²: b²(a + c). And from the last two terms, factor out c²: c²(a + b). So, the expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

That's a bit better. Now, let's recall that a + b + c = 300. So, b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the expression, we have:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So equation 2 can be rewritten as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's still a bit messy. Maybe I can factor it differently or find another approach.

Another idea: perhaps I can relate this expression to symmetric sums or use some identities. Let me think about symmetric functions.

Wait, maybe I can factor the expression in terms of a, b, c. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the given equation in terms of the sum a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

Wait, but how does that help? Let me think.

Looking at the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let's see, this can be written as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). Hmm, but not sure if that helps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps factor the expression. Let me try to factor:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a)

But that seems similar to what I had before. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can factor it as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Let me check if that's true.

Compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)

= a²b + abc + a²c + ab² + b²c + abc + abc + b c² + c²a

Wait, that's a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a + 3abc

So, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a) + 3abc

Therefore, if I subtract 3abc from both sides:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a

Which is exactly the expression in equation 2. So, equation 2 can be written as:

S * P - 3Q = 6,000,000

Where S = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

So, substituting S = 300:

300 * P - 3Q = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000

So, equation becomes:

100P - Q = 2,000,000

So, Q = 100P - 2,000,000

Hmm, so now we have equation 1: a + b + c = 300, equation 2: Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

But how does that help me? I need to find integers a, b, c such that these equations hold.

Wait, perhaps I can use symmetric polynomials. If I know S, P, Q, I can think of a, b, c as roots of the cubic equation x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0. So, the equation would be x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0.

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the roots are nonnegative integers. So perhaps I can find all possible triples (a, b, c) that satisfy S = 300, P, and Q as above.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Let me think about possible approaches.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider cases where two variables are equal, or one variable is much larger than the others.

Wait, let's consider the equation Q = 100P - 2,000,000. Since Q is abc, and P is ab + bc + ca, perhaps I can find a relationship between a, b, c.

Given that a, b, c are nonnegative integers with a + b + c = 300.

Hmm, perhaps I can fix one variable, say c, and then express a + b = 300 - c, and ab + bc + ca = P.

Wait, let me denote a + b = k, so k = 300 - c.

Then, ab + bc + ca = ab + c(a + b) = ab + c k

So, P = ab + c k

Similarly, Q = abc = c * ab

So, substituting into Q = 100P - 2,000,000:

c * ab = 100(ab + c k) - 2,000,000

Which is:

c * ab = 100 ab + 100 c k - 2,000,000

Let me rearrange:

c ab - 100 ab = 100 c k - 2,000,000

Factor ab on the left:

ab(c - 100) = 100 c k - 2,000,000

But k = 300 - c, so:

ab(c - 100) = 100 c (300 - c) - 2,000,000

Let me compute the right-hand side (RHS):

100c(300 - c) - 2,000,000 = 100*(300c - c²) - 2,000,000 = 30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000

So:

ab(c - 100) = 30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it.

Let me rewrite the RHS:

30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000 = -100c² + 30,000c - 2,000,000

I can factor out -100:

-100(c² - 300c + 20,000)

Wait, let me compute c² - 300c + 20,000. Maybe it factors nicely.

Wait, 20,000 is the constant term. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 20,000 and add up to -300. Hmm, 20,000 is 100*200, so perhaps -100 and -200.

Indeed, (c - 100)(c - 200) = c² - 300c + 20,000.

So, RHS becomes:

-100(c - 100)(c - 200)

So, putting it all together:

ab(c - 100) = -100(c - 100)(c - 200)

Hmm, so:

ab(c - 100) + 100(c - 100)(c - 200) = 0

Factor out (c - 100):

(c - 100)(ab + 100(c - 200)) = 0

So, either c - 100 = 0, which implies c = 100, or ab + 100(c - 200) = 0.

But ab and c are nonnegative integers. So, ab + 100(c - 200) = 0 would imply that ab is negative, but ab is nonnegative. So the only possibility is that 100(c - 200) is negative enough to make the sum zero. But 100(c - 200) is nonpositive when c ≤ 200. So, ab must be equal to -100(c - 200). Since ab is nonnegative, this requires that -100(c - 200) is nonnegative. So, c ≤ 200.

Wait, but ab is nonnegative, so -100(c - 200) must be nonnegative. So, c - 200 ≤ 0 ⇒ c ≤ 200.

Therefore, either c = 100 or c ≤ 200 and ab = 100(200 - c).

But wait, ab = 100(200 - c).

But c can't be more than 200 here because that would make 200 - c negative, and ab is nonnegative.

So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: c = 100

Case 2: c ≤ 200 and ab = 100(200 - c)

Let me handle each case separately.

Case 1: c = 100

Then, a + b = 300 - c = 200.

And we also have equation 2, which we've rewritten as:

ab(c - 100) = ... but since c=100, this becomes 0 = something, which we already considered.

Wait, no. Let me go back to the previous equation.

Wait, when c = 100, then from equation 2, Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

But Q = abc = a*b*100.

P = ab + bc + ca = ab + 100b + 100a.

So, substituting into equation:

100ab = 100(ab + 100a + 100b) - 2,000,000

Let me check:

Wait, no, earlier when c=100, the equation after substitution gives zero on the left, so we have to make sure the right side is zero. But in the earlier step, when c=100, we have (c - 100)=0, so the equation becomes 0 = 0, which is always true. Therefore, in this case, all triples where c=100 and a + b = 200 will satisfy equation 2.

Wait, but let me check that. Let's verify whether for c=100, any a, b with a + b = 200 will satisfy equation 2.

Wait, so equation 2 is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Since c=100, let's substitute:

a²b + a²*100 + b²a + b²*100 + 100²a + 100²b = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

a²b + 100a² + ab² + 100b² + 10,000a + 10,000b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if this is automatically zero or not. Wait, but earlier steps suggested that when c=100, the equation reduces to 0=0, so all such triples should satisfy equation 2. Let me verify with specific numbers.

Let me take a=100, b=100, c=100. Then a + b + c = 300. Let's compute equation 2:

Each term is 100²*100 = 1,000,000. There are six such terms, so total is 6,000,000. So that works.

Another example: a=200, b=0, c=100. Then a + b + c = 300.

Compute equation 2: (200)^2*0 + (200)^2*100 + 0^2*200 + 0^2*100 + 100^2*200 + 100^2*0.

Which is 0 + 4,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 2,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. That works too.

Another test: a=150, b=50, c=100.

Compute each term:

150²*50 = 22500*50=1,125,000

150²*100=22500*100=2,250,000

50²*150=2500*150=375,000

50²*100=2500*100=250,000

100²*150=10,000*150=1,500,000

100²*50=10,000*50=500,000

Adding all these up:

1,125,000 + 2,250,000 = 3,375,000

375,000 + 250,000 = 625,000

1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000

Total: 3,375,000 + 625,000 = 4,000,000; 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. So that works too.

So, in case 1, c=100, a + b = 200, and any a, b nonnegative integers adding to 200. The number of such triples is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b =200, which is 201 (since a can be 0,1,...,200, and b=200 -a).

But wait, hold on, because in the equation 2, when c=100, a + b =200, but do all such a and b necessarily satisfy equation 2? Because in my tests, they did, but let me think if there are any exceptions.

Wait, the derivation earlier suggests that when c=100, equation 2 is automatically satisfied regardless of a and b as long as a + b =200. So yes, all triples where c=100 and a + b=200 will satisfy both equations.

Therefore, case 1 gives 201 solutions.

Case 2: c ≤ 200 and ab = 100(200 - c)

So, for case 2, c can be any integer from 0 up to 200, but since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, c can be 0,1,2,...,200.

But for each c, ab must be equal to 100*(200 - c). Since a and b are nonnegative integers, ab must be a nonnegative integer as well. Therefore, 100*(200 - c) must be nonnegative, which implies that 200 - c ≥0 ⇒ c ≤200, which is already our case.

So for each c in 0 to 200, ab = 100*(200 - c). Also, a + b = 300 - c.

So, for each c, we have:

a + b = 300 - c

ab = 100*(200 - c)

We can think of a and b as the roots of the quadratic equation:

x² - (300 - c)x + 100*(200 - c) = 0

For a and b to be integers, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:

D = (300 - c)² - 4 * 1 * 100*(200 - c)

Let me compute D:

D = (300 - c)^2 - 400*(200 - c)

Expanding (300 - c)^2:

= 90,000 - 600c + c² - 80,000 + 400c

Simplify:

90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000

-600c + 400c = -200c

So, D = c² - 200c + 10,000

Hmm, so D = c² - 200c + 10,000

We need D to be a perfect square for a and b to be integers.

Let me denote D = k², where k is a nonnegative integer.

So, c² - 200c + 10,000 = k²

This is a quadratic in c: c² -200c + (10,000 -k²)=0

Alternatively, rearranged:

c² -200c + (10,000 - k²)=0

We can write this as:

c² - 200c + (10,000 - k²) = 0

Alternatively, let's complete the square for the quadratic in c:

c² - 200c + 10,000 = k²

c² -200c = k² - 10,000

Now, completing the square:

c² - 200c + (100)^2 = k² - 10,000 + (100)^2

Which is:

(c - 100)^2 = k² + 90,000

Wait, no:

Wait, let's compute c² -200c + (100)^2 = (c - 100)^2

So,

(c -100)^2 = k² +90,000 -10,000? Wait, wait.

Wait, original equation:

c² -200c + 10,000 = k²

So, c² -200c = k² -10,000

Adding 100² = 10,000 to both sides:

c² -200c +10,000 = k² -10,000 +10,000 → (c -100)^2 = k²

So, (c -100)^2 = k²

Which implies that c -100 = ±k

So, we have two possibilities:

1. c -100 = k
2. c -100 = -k

But since c and k are nonnegative integers, and k is nonnegative, let's see:

Case A: c -100 = k → c = k +100

Case B: c -100 = -k → c = 100 -k

But in case B, since c ≥0, and k ≥0, c =100 -k must be ≥0 → k ≤100

But in case A, c =k +100, but since in case 2, c ≤200, then k +100 ≤200 → k ≤100.

So, in both cases, k can be from 0 to 100.

So, for each k from 0 to 100, we can have c =k +100 (case A) or c=100 -k (case B). But wait, c is an integer, so for each k, we get two possible c's? Not exactly, because for case A, c =k +100 is valid for k=0 to 100, but in case 2, c must be ≤200, which is satisfied because k +100 ≤200 when k ≤100.

Similarly, in case B, c=100 -k, which is valid for k=0 to 100, but since in case 2, c can be as low as 0 (if k=100). So, in both cases, for each k from 0 to 100, we can get a value of c.

But wait, for each k, we have two possible c's: one from case A and one from case B. However, when k=0, c=100 in case A and c=100 in case B—so it's the same c. Similarly, when k=100, case A gives c=200, and case B gives c=0. So, in general, for each k, there are two distinct c's except when k=0, which gives c=100 in both cases.

Therefore, for each k from 0 to 100, we have two c's (c =k +100 and c=100 -k) except when k=0, which yields one c=100.

But wait, when k=0, case A gives c=100, case B gives c=100. So, same c.

So, in total, for k from 0 to 100, there are 101 values of k, each giving two c's, but when k=0, only one c. So, total number of c's from this is 2*101 -1=201. But wait, this might not be correct because in case 2, c is between 0 and 200, and for each k, we get two c's, except when k=0 and k=100, which might overlap.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let me consider that the equation (c -100)^2 = k^2 has solutions c =100 ±k, where k is a nonnegative integer such that c remains in 0 ≤c ≤200.

So, for each integer k ≥0, c can be 100 +k or 100 -k, but ensuring that c ≤200 and c ≥0.

So, for k=0: c=100 (only one solution).

For k=1: c=101 or 99.

For k=2: c=102 or 98.

...

For k=100: c=200 or 0.

So, for each k from 1 to 100, we have two solutions for c: 100 +k and 100 -k. For k=0, only one solution.

Thus, the total number of c's in case 2 is 1 + 2*100 =201.

But wait, since in case 2, c ≤200, and we're considering all c's from 0 to 200. However, in case 1, c=100 is already considered. So, are we overcounting?

Wait, no. Because in case 1, we had c=100, and in case 2, when k=0, c=100 is included. So, in case 2, c=100 is included as one of the possibilities, but in case 1, c=100 was already considered.

Therefore, we need to be careful not to double count the solutions where c=100.

So, in case 1, c=100, and any a + b=200. So, all triples with c=100 are in case 1.

In case 2, when c=100, then from the equation ab=100*(200 -c)=100*(100)=10,000, and a + b=200.

So, that's exactly the same as case 1. So, in case 2, when c=100, we have the same solutions as in case 1. Therefore, to avoid double counting, we should exclude c=100 from case 2.

Therefore, in case 2, c can be from 0 to 200, excluding 100.

But wait, when we considered c=100, it's part of case 1. So, in case 2, we have c from 0 to200, c ≠100.

But from the earlier analysis, for case 2, c can be any integer from 0 to200 except for when c=100, which is handled in case 1.

Wait, but in case 2, when c=100, ab=100*(200 -100)=10,000, and a + b=200, which is exactly the same as case 1. So, to avoid duplication, case 2 should consider c from 0 to200, c ≠100.

So, in case 2, c=0,1,...,99,101,...,200.

So, total number of c's in case 2: 201 (from 0 to200) minus 1 (c=100) =200.

But wait, for each c in case 2, we have ab=100*(200 -c), and a + b=300 -c.

So, for each c, except c=100, we can compute the number of (a,b) pairs.

But wait, for each c in case 2, the quadratic in a and b is x² - (300 -c)x + 100*(200 -c)=0.

The discriminant D must be a perfect square, which we've transformed into (c-100)^2 =k².

So, for each c, D = (c -100)^2. So, the discriminant is a perfect square, so the roots are rational, and since a and b are integers, the roots will be integers if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square, which we've ensured.

Therefore, for each c in case 2, the quadratic equation will have integer solutions a and b, except when the roots are not integers. But wait, since discriminant is a perfect square, the roots will be integers if and only if the coefficients are integers, which they are.

So, for each c in case 2, we have two solutions for a and b, unless the quadratic has a repeated root, i.e., when D=0.

When does D=0? When (c -100)^2 =0 → c=100. But c=100 is in case 1, so in case 2, D is a positive perfect square, so the quadratic will have two distinct integer solutions for each c in case 2.

But wait, let's check for c=200:

c=200, then a + b=100, ab=100*(200 -200)=0. So ab=0, so either a=0 or b=0.

So, for c=200, number of solutions is two: (a=0,b=100) and (a=100,b=0). But wait, actually, a and b are nonnegative integers, so if ab=0 and a + b=100, then either a=0 and b=100, or a=100 and b=0. So two solutions.

But wait, when c=0:

c=0, then a + b=300, ab=100*(200 -0)=20,000.

So, we have a + b=300, ab=20,000.

So, the quadratic equation is x² -300x +20,000 =0.

Let me compute the discriminant:

D=90,000 -80,000=10,000=100².

So, roots are [300 ±100]/2= (400)/2=200 and (200)/2=100.

So, a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200. So two solutions.

Similarly, for c=1:

c=1, a + b=299, ab=100*(199)=19,900.

So, quadratic equation x² -299x +19,900=0.

Compute discriminant D=299² -4*19,900.

299²= (300 -1)^2=90,000 -600 +1=89,401.

4*19,900=79,600.

So, D=89,401 -79,600=9,801=99².

So, roots are [299 ±99]/2.

(299 +99)/2=398/2=199.

(299 -99)/2=200/2=100.

So, a=199, b=100 or a=100, b=199. So two solutions.

So, for each c in case 2, except c=100, we have two solutions for a and b.

But wait, when c=100, we have only one c, but it's already handled in case 1, which gives 201 solutions.

But in case 2, c=100 is excluded. So, in case 2, we have 200 possible c's, each giving two solutions for (a,b). So, 200*2=400 solutions.

But wait, but when c=0, we have two solutions, same as when c=200. So, no overcounting.

But wait, let me think about it. For each c in case 2, we have two ordered pairs (a,b). So, for example, c=1 gives two solutions, (199,100) and (100,199). Similarly, c=200 gives (0,100) and (100,0). So, each c gives two distinct ordered triples.

But wait, are these ordered triples? Because in the problem statement, (a,b,c) are ordered triples, so (a,b,c) and (b,a,c) are considered different if a ≠ b.

Therefore, in case 2, for each c, each solution (a,b) is unique and contributes two ordered triples (a,b,c) and (b,a,c), except when a=b.

Wait, when a=b, then the two solutions are the same (a,b,c)=(b,a,c). So, in those cases, we only count once.

So, for each c in case 2, if the quadratic has two distinct roots, then we have two ordered triples. If the quadratic has a repeated root (a=b), then only one ordered triple.

But when does a=b?

From the quadratic equation, a = b when the discriminant D=0, which only occurs when c=100, which is case 1. So, in case 2, since c≠100, D is positive, so the roots are distinct. Therefore, for each c in case 2, we have two distinct ordered triples (a,b,c) and (b,a,c).

So, case 2 gives 200 c's, each contributing two ordered triples, so 200*2=400 solutions.

But wait, when c=0, a + b=300, ab=20,000. The roots are 200 and 100, which are distinct. So, (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). So, two ordered triples.

Similarly, when c=200, a + b=100, ab=0. So, a=0, b=100 or a=100, b=0. So, two ordered triples.

Hence, case 2 gives 400 solutions.

But wait, earlier when c=100, we have 201 ordered triples. So, in total, case 1 gives 201 solutions, and case 2 gives 400 solutions.

But wait, we need to ensure that in case 2, c is not 100, so as not to double count.

So, the total number of solutions is 201 (case 1) + 400 (case 2) = 601.

But, wait, let me make sure there's no overlap between case 1 and case 2.

Case 1 is c=100, which is a unique case. Case 2 includes all c's except c=100. So, no overlap.

Therefore, the total number of ordered triples is 201 + 400 = 601.

Wait, but wait, let me check, for example, c=100, which gives 201 solutions. Case 2 gives 200 c's, each with two solutions, so 400.

So, 201 +400=601.

But, hold on, let me verify with specific numbers.

Take c=100: 201 solutions.

Take c=0: 2 solutions.

c=1: 2 solutions.

c=99: 2 solutions.

c=101: 2 solutions.

c=200: 2 solutions.

So, from c=0 to c=200, except c=100, each c gives two solutions.

So, 201 c's in case 1 (c=100) and 200 c's in case 2 (c≠100). So, 201 + (200*2)=201 +400=601.

But wait, wait a second. When c=100, we have a + b=200, ab=10,000.

So, the quadratic equation is x² -200x +10,000=0.

Discriminant D=40,000 -40,000=0. So, repeated roots: x=100.

So, a=100, b=100. So, only one solution for (a,b), which is (100,100). So, the ordered triples are (100,100,100). But wait, in case 1, we have a + b=200, so a=100, b=100 is one solution, but since a and b are nonnegative integers, their sum is 200, but a and b can range from 0 to200. So, the number of solutions is 201 because a can be 0 to200, but when a=100, b=100 is only one solution. Wait, no, when a=100, b=100 is one specific solution, but all a from 0 to200, with b=200 -a, gives 201 ordered pairs, including (100,100). So, in case 1, we have 201 ordered triples (a,b,100), where a can be 0 to200, and b=200 -a.

So, each of these 201 triples is unique because a and b can vary, including a=100, which gives (100,100,100).

Thus, case 1 contributes 201 solutions.

Case 2 contributes 400 solutions.

Total solutions: 601.

But, wait, let me think again: when c=100, in case 1, the number of solutions is 201, which includes (100,100,100). In case 2, when c≠100, each c gives two solutions. So, in total, 201 +400=601.

But wait, I think 601 is the answer. But wait, let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, let's consider that the equation is symmetric in a, b, c. So, perhaps each solution can be arranged in different orders.

Wait, but in case 1, c=100, leading to 201 solutions, which includes a and b varying. So, some of these may have a=100 or b=100, but in case 2, c is varying.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this problem as a Diophantine equation.

Wait, but perhaps I can think about the number of ordered triples (a,b,c) where a + b + c=300 and 300P - Q=6,000,000, which leads to Q=100P -2,000,000.

But that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can write equation 2 in terms of a, b, c.

Wait, equation 2 is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b =6,000,000.

Which is equal to ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a).

But since a + b + c=300, a + b=300 -c, etc. So, substituting, it's ab*(300 -c) + bc*(300 -a) + ca*(300 -b) =6,000,000.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, but I already did the earlier steps, so it's better to stick to the previous reasoning.

So, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but 601 seems a bit arbitrary. Let me confirm once more.

Case 1: c=100, a + b=200, number of solutions:201.

Case 2: c≠100, each c gives two solutions, number of c's:200 (from 0 to200, excluding100). So, 200*2=400.

Total:201 +400=601.

Yes, that seems correct.

But wait, the answer is 601? Let me think again. Because 601 seems a prime number, which might be the case.

But let me check with another example. Suppose c=50.

Then, a + b=250, ab=100*(200 -50)=15,000.

So, quadratic equation x² -250x +15,000=0.

Discriminant D=62,500 -60,000=2,500=50².

So, roots are [250 ±50]/2= 300/2=150 and 200/2=100.

So, a=150, b=100 or a=100, b=150. So two solutions.

Thus, each c in case 2 gives two solutions, so 200 c's give 400 solutions.

Case 1 gives 201 solutions.

Total:601.

Therefore, the answer is 601.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given equations:

1. \( a + b + c = 300 \)
2. \( a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 \)

We rewrite the second equation using symmetric sums:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc
\]
Substituting \( a + b + c = 300 \), we get:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000
\]
Simplifying:
\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000
\]
Let \( P = ab + bc + ca \) and \( Q = abc \). Then:
\[
100P - Q = 2,000,000 \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q = 100P - 2,000,000
\]

We consider two cases:

**Case 1:** \( c = 100 \)

Here, \( a + b = 200 \). Any nonnegative integers \( a, b \) satisfying this sum will satisfy the second equation. The number of solutions is the number of nonnegative integer pairs \( (a, b) \), which is \( 201 \).

**Case 2:** \( c \neq 100 \)

For each \( c \) from \( 0 \) to \( 200 \) (excluding \( 100 \)), we solve:
\[
a + b = 300 - c \quad \text{and} \quad ab = 100(200 - c)
\]
The quadratic equation for \( a \) and \( b \) is:
\[
x^2 - (300 - c)x + 100(200 - c) = 0
\]
The discriminant \( D = (c - 100)^2 \), ensuring integer roots. Each \( c \) (except \( 100 \)) yields two solutions for \( (a, b) \). There are \( 200 \) such \( c \), giving \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \) solutions.

Adding the solutions from both cases:
\[
201 \ (\text{Case 1}) + 400 \ (\text{Case 2}) = 601
\]

Thus, the number of triples is \(\boxed{601}\).
