Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The problem is: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when N is divided by 1000, we get a quotient Q and a remainder R. We need to find Q + R.

Alright, so first, N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with the given property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

Let me break that down. Suppose N is represented as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, A is the thousands digit, B is the hundreds, C is the tens, and D is the units digit. Now, the condition is that if we replace any one digit with 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.

So, for example, if I replace A with 1, the number becomes 1BCD, and that should be divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, which should also be divisible by 7. The same goes for replacing C with 1 (AB1D) and D with 1 (ABC1). All four of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Given that, I need to find the largest such four-digit number N.

Once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000. The quotient Q would be the thousands digit, and the remainder R would be the last three digits. Then, add Q and R together to get the final answer.

So, my first task is to find the maximum N satisfying the given condition.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since we're looking for the greatest such four-digit number, maybe I can start from 9999 and work my way down, checking each number to see if it satisfies the condition. But that seems time-consuming, especially since 9999 is the largest four-digit number, but it's possible that the number is somewhere below that.

But before jumping into that, perhaps I can find a smarter approach.

Given that replacing any digit with 1 must lead to a number divisible by 7, maybe I can model the conditions mathematically.

Let's denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits (a from 1-9, others from 0-9).

Now, when we replace a with 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's denote this as N1.

Similarly, replacing b with 1 gives 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d, which is N2.

Replacing c with 1 gives 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d, which is N3.

Replacing d with 1 gives 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1, which is N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, mathematically, we can write:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, let's write expressions for each of these:

1. N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2. N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3. N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4. N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, we have four congruence conditions.

Now, perhaps we can express each of these in terms of N. Let's see.

Wait, since N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, then:

N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - 1000a + 1000 + 0? No, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract N from each of these expressions to find relations.

Wait, let's compute N1 - N:

N1 - N = (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 1000 - 1000a

Similarly, N2 - N = (1000a + 100 + 10c + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 100 - 100b

N3 - N = (1000a + 100b + 10 + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 10 - 10c

N4 - N = (1000a + 100b + 10c + 1) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 1 - d

So, N1 - N = 1000(1 - a)

N2 - N = 100(1 - b)

N3 - N = 10(1 - c)

N4 - N = (1 - d)

Now, since N1 is divisible by 7, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 => (N + (N1 - N)) ≡ 0 mod 7. Wait, maybe I'm complicating.

Alternatively, since N
