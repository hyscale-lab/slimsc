Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I'll start by recalling what each term means.

1. **Sum is 30**: That means when I add up all the numbers in the list, the total is 30. So, if the list has, say, n elements, they add up to 30.

2. **Unique mode is 9**: Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, so 9 appears more times than any other number. So, 9 must be in the list, and it must occur more often than any other number.

3. **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: Median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer, so if it's even length, the average must result in an integer. Also, this median isn't in the list itself.

Okay, let's start thinking about how to construct such a list.

First, let's consider the mode. Since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, the number of 9s must be at least two, but depending on the other numbers, maybe more.

Suppose the list has k occurrences of 9. Then, all other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

Now, the sum of all numbers is 30. Let's think about how many 9s could be there.

If I have too many 9s, the sum might exceed 30. Let's see.

Suppose there are 3 nines: 3*9=27. Then the remaining sum is 30-27=3. So, the other numbers must sum to 3. Since all are positive integers, they could be 1, 2, and 0? Wait, no, 0 isn't allowed because it's a list of positive integers. So the remaining numbers would have to be 1, 1, 1. But then 1 appears three times, and 9 appears three times. That would make both 1 and 9 modes, which conflicts with the unique mode. So that can't be.

So, with 3 nines, the remaining sum is 3, but the other numbers can't be all 1s because they would tie with 9 for mode.

Alternatively, maybe the remaining numbers are two 1s and one 1? Wait, that's the same as three 1s. So that would create a tie. So 3 nines might not work because we can't have the remaining sum as 3 without duplicating the count.

Wait, maybe the remaining numbers don't all have to be the same. Let me think. If I have 3 nines (sum 27), the remaining three numbers sum to 3. They have to be positive integers, but they can be different. For example, 1, 1, 1, but that's three 1s, which is a problem. Or 1, 2, 0? No, can't have zero. So maybe 1, 1, 1 is the only way, but that causes a problem with the mode.

So maybe 3 nines isn't possible. Let's try 4 nines. 4*9=36. But 36 is already more than 30, which is the total sum. So that's impossible. So maximum number of 9s is 3, but that causes issues.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. If we have 3 nines, that's 27. Remaining sum is 3. The remaining numbers have to add up to 3, but to avoid having another mode, each of them can appear at most twice. Wait, if I have two 1s and one 1, that's three 1s, which ties with 3 nines.

Alternatively, can I have other numbers? Let's see: 3 can be 1, 2. So, maybe one 1 and one 2. Wait, that's two numbers, but 27+1+2=30. So the list would have [9,9,9,1,2]. The sum is 27+3=3
