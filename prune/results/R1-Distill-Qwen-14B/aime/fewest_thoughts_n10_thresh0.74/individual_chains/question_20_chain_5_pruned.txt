Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for color. The conditions are a bit tricky, but let me try to break them down.

First, each cell can have at most one chip. So, no cell can have more than one chipâ€”either white, black, or none. Got that. The next condition says that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must have the same color. Hmm, so if I place a chip in a row, every chip in that row has to be the same color. Same goes for columns. That means each row and each column is either all white, all black, or has no chips at all.

Wait, no, actually, that's not exactly right. The condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color and all chips in the same column have the same color. So, it's possible that a row has chips and a column has chips, but only if the color is consistent. For example, if a row has white chips, then any column that intersects with that row must also either have white chips or have no chips. Because if a column had black chips, then the intersection cell would have a white and a black chip, which is impossible since each cell can have at most one chip. So, this suggests that the coloring is somewhat consistent across both rows and columns.

Another way to think about it: Each row can be either all white, all black, or empty, and each column can be either all white, all black, or empty. But they can't conflict. So, the color of a row and the color of a column must be compatible. That is, if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection would have a cell that can't have a chip because the row says white and the column says black, but the cell can't have both.

This seems like the grid has to be divided into regions where each region is a rectangle (maybe a single row or column) of the same color, and these regions can't overlap in conflicting ways.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a bipartite graph. Because the rows and columns are two separate sets, and placing a color in a row affects the possible colors of columns and vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps each row can be assigned a color (white, black,
