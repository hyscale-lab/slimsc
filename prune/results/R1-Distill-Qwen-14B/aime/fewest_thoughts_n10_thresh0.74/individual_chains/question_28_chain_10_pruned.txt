Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (a point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be in the form m√n/p, and then I need to find m + n + p. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, the tetrahedron has all its opposite edges equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, and BC=AD. That seems symmetrical. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron or something. I think in such cases, the tetrahedron is called "equilic" or maybe "isohedral," but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a tetrahedron where all opposite edges are equal. Hmm, whatever the case, maybe there's a way to compute the volume and surface area without knowing all the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using the edge lengths. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the volume formula for such a tetrahedron is known? Let me recall. Oh, right! There's a formula for the volume of a tetrahedron when all opposite edges are equal. It's something like:

V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / (6 * something). Wait, no, that's not quite it. Maybe it's derived from the Cayley-Menger determinant? Yeah, that seems more accurate.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

det = | 0 1 1 1 1 |
       | 1 0 a² b² c² |
       | 1 a² 0 d² e² |
       | 1 b² d² 0 f² |
       | 1 c² e² f² 0 |

And the volume V is sqrt( det / 288 ). Since all the opposite edges are equal, maybe this determinant will simplify nicely.

Let me assign the given lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41)

AC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80)

AD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89)

BC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89)

BD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80)

CD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41)

So plugging these into the determinant:

det = | 0 1 1 1 1 |
       | 1 0 41 80 89 |
       | 1 41 0 89 80 |
       | 1 80 89 0 41 |
       | 1 89 80 41 0 |

Wait, let me write this out properly. Each entry is as follows:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Calculating this determinant might be a bit tedious, but since the matrix is symmetric, maybe there's a pattern or a way to simplify it.

Alternatively, I remember that for a tetrahedron where all opposite edges are equal, the volume can be calculated using another formula. Let me think. Maybe it's related to the product of the edges or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box? That might be a useful approach. Let me consider that.

In a rectangular box with sides of lengths x, y, z, the space diagonals can be used to represent the
