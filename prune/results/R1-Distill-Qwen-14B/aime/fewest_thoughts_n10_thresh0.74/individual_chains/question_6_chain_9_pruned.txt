Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says to define two functions, f(x) and g(x), where f(x) is the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2, and g(x) is the absolute value of |x| minus 1/4. Then, I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y equals 4 times g of f of sin(2πx), and x equals 4 times g of f of cos(3πy). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the functions to make it clearer.

f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |
g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |

Then, the two equations we're dealing with are:

y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))   ...(1)

and

x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))   ...(2)

We need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations. So, essentially, I'm looking for all (x, y) such that when I plug x into equation (1), I get y, and then plug y into equation (2), I get x. Or vice versa. It's like solving a system of equations where each equation is defined in terms of the other variable.

I think I should start by understanding the behavior of f and g functions. Let's break down f(x) and g(x) first.

Starting with f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |. Let me consider different cases based on the value of x.

Case 1: x >= 0. Then, |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|. This is a V-shaped graph with a vertex at x = 1/2, opening upwards. So, for x >= 0, f(x) = x - 1/2 when x >= 1/2, and 1/2 - x when x < 1/2.

Case 2: x < 0. Then, |x| = -x, so f(x) = |-x - 1/2| = | - (x + 1/2)| = |x + 1/2|. This is another V-shaped graph with a vertex at x = -1/2, opening upwards. So, for x < 0, f(x) = -x -1/2 when x <= -1/2, and x + 1/2 when -1/2 < x < 0.

So, f(x) is a piecewise function with different linear segments. It has vertices at x = -1/2, 0, 1/2.

Similarly, let's analyze g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.

Again, considering x >=0 and x <0.

Case 1: x >=0. Then, g(x) = |x - 1/4|. This is V-shaped with vertex at x = 1/4. So, for x >=1/4, g(x) = x -1/4, and for x <1/4, g(x) = 1/4 -x.

Case 2: x <0. Then, g(x) = |-x -1/4| = | - (x + 1/4)| = |x +1/4|. So for x <= -1/4, g(x) = -x -1/4, and for -1/4 <x <0, g(x) =x +1/4.

So, g(x) is also a piecewise linear function with vertices at -1/4, 0, 1/4.

Now, I think I should consider the composition of these functions. Let's see.

First, let's figure out f(sin(2πx)). Since sin(2πx) is a periodic function with period 1, because the sine function normally has period 2π, but here the argument is 2πx, so the period is 1.

Similarly, cos(3πy) is a periodic function with period 2/3 because the argument is 3πy, so period is 2/(3π) * 2π = 2/3? Wait, let me think. The period of cos(kθ) is 2π/k. So, for cos(3πy), the period is 2π/(3π) )= 2/3. So yes, the period is 2/3.

So, the functions inside g(f(...)) are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3 respectively.

But perhaps I should first find the range of the inner functions f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)).

Let me think about f(sin(2πx)) first.

Since sin(2πx) varies between -1 and 1. So, let me compute f(t) where t ranges from -1 to 1.

f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 |.

So, for t in [-1,1], |t| is in [0,1]. So | |t| - 1/2 | will vary depending on |t|.

Let me make a table.

|t| can be from 0 to 1.

So, |t| - 1/2 can be from -1/2 to 1/2.

Taking absolute value, f(t) = | |t| -1/2 | varies from 0 (when |t|=1/2) to 1/2 (when |t|=0 or |t|=1).

So the range of f(t) for t in [-1,1] is [0, 1/2].

Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Similarly, let's compute g(f(sin(2πx))). Since f(sin(2πx)) is in [0,1/2], and g is applied to that.

g(s) = | |s| - 1/4 |, where s is in [0,1/2].

So, since s is non-negative, |s| = s. So,

g(s) = | s - 1/4 |.

Which is a V-shaped function with vertex at s =1/4.

So, when s <=1/4, g(s) = 1/4 - s.

When s >=1/4, g(s) = s -1/4.

Therefore, the range of g(s) when s is in [0,1/2] is:

At s=0: g(0)= 1/4.

At s=1/4: g(1/4)=0.

At s=1/2: g(1/2)=1/2 -1/4=1/4.

So, the range of g(f(sin(2πx))) is [0, 1/4].

Then, when multiplied by 4, 4*g(...) ranges from 0 to 1.

So, in equation (1): y = 4*g(f(sin(2πx))) implies y is in [0,1].

Similarly, let's look at equation (2): x =4*g(f(cos(3πy))).

First, cos(3πy) varies between -1 and 1, just like sin(2πx). So, f(cos(3πy)) is similar to f(sin(2πx)), so it's also in [0,1/2].

Then, g(f(cos(3πy))) is in [0,1/4], and multiplied by 4 gives x in [0,1].

So, both variables x and y are in [0,1]. So, the points of intersection lie in the square [0,1]x[0,1].

Now, the problem reduces to finding the number of solutions (x,y) in [0,1]x[0,1] such that:

y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))   ...(1)

and

x =4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))   ...(2)

So, I need to solve this system.

Since both equations involve trigonometric functions with different frequencies (2πx and 3πy), this could result in a complicated system. But perhaps I can analyze the functions step by step.

Let me first consider equation (1): y =4*g(f(sin(2πx))).

We know that sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1, so perhaps I can consider x in [0,1], and for each x, compute y.

Similarly, equation (2) involves y in [0,1], so for each y, compute x.

But since it's a system, I can't just solve one without considering the other.

I think maybe the best approach is to consider the composition of functions and see how many times these two graphs intersect in the unit square.

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can try to understand the behavior of each function.

Let me first analyze y as a function of x, given by equation (1).

Starting with sin(2πx):

sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, going from 0 up to 1 at x=1/4, back to 0 at x=1/2, down to -1 at x=3/4, and back to 0 at x=1.

So, sin(2πx) is symmetric around x=1/2.

Then, f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Since |sin(2πx)| is always non-negative, f(sin(2πx)) is | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 |.

So, let's compute f(sin(2πx)):

Case 1: |sin(2πx)| >=1/2.

Then, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| -1/2.

Case 2: |sin(2πx)| <1/2.

Then, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So, the function f(sin(2πx)) will have different expressions depending on whether |sin(2πx)| is above or below 1/2.

Similarly, g(f(sin(2πx))) is | f(sin(2πx)) -1/4 |.

Wait, but earlier we saw that f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2, so g(s) where s in [0,1/2] is |s - 1/4|.

So, when s <=1/4, g(s)=1/4 -s.

When s >=1/4, g(s)=s -1/4.

Therefore, 4*g(s) will be 4*(1/4 -s) =1-4s when s<=1/4, and 4*(s-1/4)=4s-1 when s>=1/4.

So, y=4*g(s) where s = f(sin(2πx)).

So, let's understand when s is <=1/4 and when it's >=1/4.

s = f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 |.

So, s <=1/4 when | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | <=1/4.

Which implies that -1/4 <= |sin(2πx)| -1/2 <=1/4.

Adding 1/2 to all sides: 1/4 <= |sin(2πx)| <= 3/4.

So, s <=1/4 when |sin(2πx)| is between 1/4 and 3/4.

Similarly, s >=1/4 when |sin(2πx)| <=1/4 or |sin(2πx)| >=3/4.

Wait, no, because s = | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 |.

So, when |sin(2πx)| is closer to 1/2 than 1/4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to solve for when s >=1/4.

So, s >=1/4 when | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | >=1/4.

Which implies that |sin(2πx)| -1/2 <= -1/4 or |sin(2πx)| -1/2 >=1/4.

So, |sin(2πx)| <=1/4 or |sin(2πx)| >=3/4.

Therefore:

- When |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1/4 (including 0 and 1/4), s = | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|, which is >=1/4.

- When |sin(2πx)| is between 1/4 and 3/4, s <=1/4.

- When |sin(2πx)| is between 3/4 and 1, s >=1/4 again.

So, for equation (1):

y =4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) =4 * [ (1/4 - s) if s <=1/4 else (s -1/4) ]

Which translates to:

- If s <=1/4 (i.e., |sin(2πx)| is in [1/4, 3/4]), then y=1 -4s =1 -4*( | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | )

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, earlier, when s <=1/4, g(s)=1/4 -s, so 4*g(s)=1 -4s.

When s >=1/4, g(s)=s -1/4, so 4*g(s)=4s -1.

So, y is:

y = 1 -4s when s <=1/4,

y =4s -1 when s >=1/4,

where s = f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 |.

So, substituting s:

y = 1 -4*( | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | ) when | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | <=1/4,

and

y =4*( | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | ) -1 when | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | >=1/4.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should make a table or graph of y as a function of x.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the behavior of y over the interval [0,1].

Let me note that sin(2πx) has its critical points at x=0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1.

At x=0, sin(0)=0.

At x=1/4, sin(2π*(1/4))=sin(π/2)=1.

At x=1/2, sin(π)=0.

At x=3/4, sin(3π/2)=-1.

At x=1, sin(2π)=0.

So, the function sin(2πx) oscillates between 0, 1, 0, -1, 0 over x in [0,1].

So, |sin(2πx)| is a waveform that goes from 0 to 1 at x=1/4, back to 0 at x=1/2, up to 1 at x=3/4, and back to 0 at x=1.

So, let's consider |sin(2πx)|, which is symmetric around x=1/2 and x=3/4.

Then, f(|sin(2πx)|) = | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 |.

So, let's evaluate f(|sin(2πx)|) at key points:

At x=0: |sin(0)|=0. f(0)=|0 -1/2|=1/2.

At x=1/4: |sin(π/2)|=1. f(1)=|1 -1/2|=1/2.

At x=1/2: |sin(π)|=0. f(0)=1/2.

At x=3/4: |sin(3π/2)|=1. f(1)=1/2.

At x=1: |sin(2π)|=0. f(0)=1/2.

Wait, but that seems constant? No, wait, that can't be right because in between these points, |sin(2πx)| varies.

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider the function more carefully.

Wait, between x=0 and x=1/4, |sin(2πx)| increases from 0 to 1.

Similarly, between x=1/4 and x=1/2, |sin(2πx)| decreases from 1 to 0.

But f(|sin(2πx)|) is | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. So, when |sin(2πx)| is 1/2, f is 0. That occurs when |sin(2πx)|=1/2, which happens at x=1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8.

So, let's make a table for x in [0,1], and compute f(|sin(2πx)|) and then y.

But this might take a while, but perhaps I can sketch the graph.

Wait, perhaps I can think of f(|sin(2πx)|) as follows:

For each x, compute |sin(2πx)|, subtract 1/
