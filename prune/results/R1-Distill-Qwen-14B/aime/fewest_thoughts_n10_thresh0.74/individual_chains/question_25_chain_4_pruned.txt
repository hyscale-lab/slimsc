Okay, let's try to figure out how many residents own all four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, so we have a total of 900 residents. 

First, let's list out the numbers we know. There are:
- 195 diamond ring owners,
- 367 golf club owners,
- 562 garden spade owners,
and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are owned by all 900 residents. That seems important because it means the universal set here includes everyone.

We also know that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. We need to find how many own all four.

I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion in set theory. It's used to calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets. The formula goes like this:

Total = A + B + C + D - (sum of exactly two) - 2*(sum of exactly three) - 3*(all four) + ... Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. But I'm not too familiar with that. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's denote the four items as A, B, C, D. Here, A is diamond ring, B is golf clubs, C is garden spade, and D is candy hearts. But since everyone owns D, that might simplify things.

Wait, so D is owned by all 900, so D = 900. So when considering the union of A, B, C, D, the total is 900 because everyone is in D. Therefore, the union of A, B, C, and D is 900. So, using inclusion-exclusion:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But since |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| is 900, that equation equals 900. Let me plug in the numbers we have.

|A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562, |D| = 900.

So, 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - |A∩B∩C∩D|

Hmm, this seems complicated because I don't know the pairwise or triple intersections. Maybe there's another way.

Wait, I also know the number of people who own exactly two and exactly three things
