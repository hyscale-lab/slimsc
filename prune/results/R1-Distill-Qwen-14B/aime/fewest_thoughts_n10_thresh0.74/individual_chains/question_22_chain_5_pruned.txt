Alright, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, the hexagon ABCDEF is convex and equilateral. That means all its sides are equal in length, right? So AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA. But it's not necessarily regular because the angles can be different. Also, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So AB is parallel to CD, which is parallel to EF. Similarly, BC is parallel to DE, which is parallel to FA. Wait, no, actually, in a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. Let me think: in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel and equal, but in this case, it's only equilateral, not regular, but the opposite sides are still parallel. So AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. So for ABCDEF, AB is opposite to DE, BC is opposite to EF, and CD is opposite to FA. So yeah, that makes sense.

So, the problem says that the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm. Okay, so I'm picturing a convex hexagon where each pair of opposite sides is parallel. That should mean that it's a centrally symmetric hexagon, right? Because if you have opposite sides equal and parallel, it's like a translation symmetry.

Wait, but it's equilateral, so all sides are equal. So maybe it's a special kind of hexagon. Also, when you extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Let me try to visualize that.

If I extend AB, CD, and EF, each of these extensions will meet at some points, forming a triangle. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. So, maybe I can model this triangle and relate it to the hexagon.

I think I need to use similar triangles or some properties of parallel lines here. Maybe the hexagon is related to the triangle in a way that the sides of the hexagon are proportional to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, in such a hexagon, if all opposite sides are parallel, it's called a translationally symmetric hexagon. So, maybe the hexagon can be thought of as a smaller version of the triangle, with each side scaled down by some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is the outer triangle formed by extending the sides of the hexagon, and the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle. So, the hexagon is inside the triangle, touching each side.

But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should draw a rough sketch in my mind. Imagine a triangle, and then on each side, we have a line segment that is part of the hexagon. Each of these segments is equal in length, and opposite sides are parallel.

Wait, maybe the hexagon can be thought of as cutting off smaller triangles from the corners of the larger triangle. But since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the cuts must be done symmetrically
