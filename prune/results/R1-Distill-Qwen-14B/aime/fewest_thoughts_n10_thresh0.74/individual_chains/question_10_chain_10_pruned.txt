Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says Bob's list has 2024 sets, and we need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's try to understand what's going on here. So, Alice picks some set A, and then Bob considers all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in A. The total number of such B's is 2024. We need to figure out what A is, specifically the sum of its elements.

First, let's think about what kind of sets B we're talking about. Each set B is finite and nonempty, and it has a maximum element that's in A. So for each element m in A, we can consider all possible sets B where m is the maximum. Then the total number of B's would be the sum over each m in A of the number of such sets for that m.

Wait, how does that work? For a given m, how many sets B have m as their maximum? Well, if m is the maximum, then all other elements in B must be less than m. So, the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m-1}. But since B must be non-empty, the number of such sets is 2^{m-1} - 1. Wait, no. Wait, the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1} is 2^{m-1}, including the empty set. But since B must be non-empty, and m is included, so for each m, the number of sets B with maximum m is 2^{m-1}.

Wait, let me check. If the maximum is m, then B must contain m and any combination of the numbers less than m. So the number of such sets is indeed 2^{m-1}, because for each of the m-1 numbers, they can be either included or excluded. So for each m in A, the number of B's with maximum m is 2^{m-1}.

So Bob's list is the union of all these sets for each m in A, and the total number is the sum over each m in A of 2^{m-1}. So, sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 20
