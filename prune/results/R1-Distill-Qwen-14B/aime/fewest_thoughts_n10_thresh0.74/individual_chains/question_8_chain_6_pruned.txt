Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given. We have two equations involving a, b, and c. The first one is linear, and the second one is a bit more complex. I need to find all triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both.

First, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using the first equation. Since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can let c = 300 - a - b. Then, substitute this into the second equation to reduce the number of variables.

Let me write that down:

c = 300 - a - b.

Now, substitute c into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Substituting c, we get:

a²b + a²(300 - a - b) + b²a + b²(300 - a - b) + (300 - a - b)²a + (300 - a - b)²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe I can expand and simplify terms.

Let me compute each term one by one.

First term: a²b.

Second term: a²(300 - a - b) = 300a² - a³ - a²b.

Third term: b²a.

Fourth term: b²(300 - a - b) = 300b² - a b² - b³.

Fifth term: (300 - a - b)²a. Let's expand (300 - a - b)^2 first:

(300 - a - b)^2 = 300² - 2*300*(a + b) + (a + b)^2 = 90000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b².

So, multiplying by a:

a*(90000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b²) = 90000a - 600a² - 600ab + a³ + 2a²b + a b².

Similarly, the sixth term is (300 - a - b)^2 b:

b*(90000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b²) = 90000b - 600ab - 600b² + a²b + 2ab² + b³.

Now, let's collect all these terms:

1. a²b

2. 300a² - a³ - a²b

3. b²a

4. 300b² - a b² - b³

5. 90000a - 600a² - 600ab + a³ + 2a²b + a b²

6. 90000b - 600ab - 600b² + a²b + 2ab² + b³

Now, let's sum all these terms together:

Let's collect the terms by their degree and variables.

First, let's look for a³ and b³ terms:

From term 2: -a³

From term 4: -b³

From term 5: +a³

From term 6: +b³

So, -a³ + a³ cancels out, same with -b³ + b³. So no a³ or b³ terms left.

Now, terms with a²b:

From term 1: +a²b

From term 2: -a²b

From term 5: +2a²b

From term 6: +a²b

So, adding them up: a²b - a²b + 2a²b + a²b = 3a²b.

Similarly, terms with ab²:

From term 3: +a b²

From term 4: -a b²

From term 5: +a b²

From term 6: +2ab²

Adding them up: a b² - a b² + a b² + 2ab² = 2ab² + a b² = 3ab².

Wait, no, let's recount. Term 3: +a b², term 4: -a b², term5: +a b², term6: +2ab².

So, 3ab²? Let me see:

First term: a²b.

Term 3: ab².

Then, in term 5: 2a²b and a b².

In term6: a²b and 2ab².

Wait, perhaps I should recompute:

Wait, maybe I'm missing some terms. Let's do it step by step.

Looking for a²b:

- Term1: +a²b
- Term2: -a²b
- Term5: +2a²b
- Term6: +a²b

Total: (1 -1 + 2 +1) a²b = 3a²b.

Similarly, ab²:

- Term3: +ab²
- Term4: -ab²
- Term5: +ab²
- Term6: +2ab²

Total: (1 -1 +1 +2) ab² = 3ab².

Okay, so 3a²b + 3ab².

Now, terms with a²:

Term2: 300a².

Term5: -600a².

Term6: no a² terms.

Is that right? Let me check term5: 90000a -600a² -600ab + a³ + 2a²b + a b². So, yes, -600a².

Similarly, term2: 300a².

So, total a² terms: 300a² -600a² = -300a².

Similarly, terms with b²:

Term4: 300b².

Term6: -600b².

So, total b² terms: 300b² -600b² = -300b².

Terms with a:

Term5: 90000a.

Term6: 90000b.

So, total a: 90000a.

Total b: 90000b.

Terms with ab:

Looking for ab terms:

Term2: -600ab.

Term5: -600ab.

Term6: -600ab.

Wait, let me check:

Term5: -600ab.

Term6: -600ab.

Wait, term5 and term6 both have -600ab, right?

Wait, term5: 90000a -600a² -600ab + a³ + 2a²b + a b².

Term6: 90000b -600ab -600b² + a²b + 2ab² + b³.

So, term5: -600ab.

Term6: -600ab.

So, total ab terms: -600ab -600ab = -1200ab.

Wait, no, I think I miscounted. Term5 has -600ab, term6 has another -600ab, so together that's -1200ab.

But wait, that's all? Let's see: any other ab terms? Term1: a²b, term3: ab². So, no other ab terms.

So total ab terms: -1200ab.

So putting all together:

3a²b + 3ab² -300a² -300b² +90000a +90000b -1200ab = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's still a bit messy. Maybe factor some terms.

Let me factor 3ab from the first two terms: 3ab(a + b) -300a² -300b² +90000(a + b) -1200ab = 6,000,000.

Wait, let's note that a + b = 300 - c, but since we've substituted c, a + b = 300 - c, but c is expressed in terms of a and b. Maybe a + b = 300
