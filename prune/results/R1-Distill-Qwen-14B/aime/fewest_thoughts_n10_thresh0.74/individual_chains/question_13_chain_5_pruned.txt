Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, so Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She goes at a constant speed, s km/h, and it takes her 4 hours including t minutes at the coffee shop. Then, when she walks faster, at s+2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes. We need to find how long the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes.

Wait, so the problem is about finding the time when her speed is s + 1/2, but first, I think I need to find the values of s and t. Because without knowing s and t, I can't directly find the time for the new speed.

Let me break it down. When she walks at speed s, the time taken for the walk (excluding coffee shop) would be distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours. But the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. So I should convert t into hours to make the units consistent.

Wait, t is in minutes, so I'll convert it to hours by dividing by 60. So the equation would be:

9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the walking time is 9/(s+2) hours, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours. So the equation is:

9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, so I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t. Let's write that:

(9/s + t/60) - (9/(s+2) + t/60) = 4 - 2.4

Simplify the left side: 9/s - 9/(s+2) + (t/60 - t/60) = 1.6

So the t terms cancel out. So now:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Factor out the 9:

9*(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s+2) = [ (s+2) - s ] / [ s(s+2) ) ] = 2 / [ s(s+2) ]

So substituting back:

9*(2)/(s(s+2)) = 1.6

So 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6

Let me write that as:

18 = 1.6 * s(s+2)

Compute 1.6 * s(s+2) = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

So the equation becomes:

18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

Let's rearrange it:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals can be tricky. Maybe multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, 1.6 *10=16, 3.2 *10=32, 18*10=180. So:

16 s^2 +32 s - 180 =0

We can simplify this quadratic equation by dividing all terms by 4:

4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

Now, let's solve for s using quadratic formula.

The quadratic is 4sÂ² +8s -45
