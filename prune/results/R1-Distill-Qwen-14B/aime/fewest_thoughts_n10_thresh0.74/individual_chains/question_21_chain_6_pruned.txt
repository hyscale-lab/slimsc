Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" integers. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

So, the problem says that for an integer base b (where b is at least 2), a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 6 followed by 3, so 63_13. Then, 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.

The task is to find the least integer b (b ≥ 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I'm looking for the smallest base where there are over ten numbers that fit this b-eautiful criteria.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let me formalize the conditions.

When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means in base b, n can be written as d1*d0, where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the units place. So, mathematically, n = d1 * b + d0.

The sum of the digits d1 + d0 should equal sqrt(n). So:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n)

But since n is equal to d1*b + d0, we can substitute:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)

Hmm, okay. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this somehow or find a better way to express it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, they must satisfy 0 ≤ d1, d0 < b. Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, d1 must be at least 1 (because the first digit can't be zero). So, d1 ranges from 1 to b-1, and d0 ranges from 0 to b-1.

So for each base b, we can iterate through possible d1 and d0 values, compute n = d1*b + d0, check if d1 + d0 equals sqrt(n), and count how many such n exist for each b. We need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

But since we're looking for the minimal b, perhaps we can find a way to model this equation and find a parametric solution or find a way to count the number of solutions without brute-forcing for each b.

Let me try to reorganize the equation:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me let s = d1 + d0. So, s^2 = d1*b + d0.

But n = d1*b + d0, and n = s^2. So, substituting, s^2 = d1*b + d0.

But d0 can be expressed in terms of s and d1: d0 = s^2 - d1*b.

But since d0 is a digit, it must be between 0 and b-1, inclusive. So:

0 ≤ s^2 - d1*b ≤ b - 1

Which implies:

d1*b ≤ s^2 ≤ d1*b + (b - 1)

But since d0 = s^2 - d1*b, and d0 < b, we have s^2 < d1*b + b = b*(d1 + 1). So,

s^2 < b*(d1 + 1)

But s = d1 + d0, and d0 < b. So, s < d1 + (b). Wait, but s is d1 + d0, which is at least d1 + 0 = d1 and at most d1 + (b-1). So, s ranges from d1 to d1 + b - 1.

But s is also equal to sqrt(n), which is sqrt(d1*b + d0). Since d0 is less than b, n is less than d1*b + b = b*(d1 + 1). So, sqrt(n) < sqrt(b*(d1 + 1)).

But n is equal to s^2, so s^2 = d1*b + d0. Hmm, maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, let's express the equation as:

s^2 = d1*b + d0

But since s = d1 + d0, we can write d0 = s - d1.

Substituting into the equation:

s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)

So,

s^2 = d1*(b - 1) + s

Rearranging,

s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)

So,

d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).

So, for a given b, the number of possible s that make (s^2 - s) divisible by (b - 1), and then d1 must be an integer in the range 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1, and d0 must be non-negative and less than b.

So, maybe I can fix b and then find all s such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then compute d1 and d0 from that.

Alternatively, since s^2 - s must be a multiple of (b - 1), perhaps we can write this as:

s(s - 1) ≡ 0 mod (b - 1)

Which means that s ≡ 0 mod k or s ≡ 1 mod k, where k is a factor of (b - 1). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, for each s, b must be such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1). So for each s, possible b's are such that (b - 1) divides (s^2 - s). So, b - 1 is a divisor of s(s - 1). Therefore, for each s, the possible b's are 1 + d, where d divides s(s - 1).

But since we're looking for the minimal b where the number of b-eautiful integers is more than ten, perhaps we can model this differently.

Wait, for each s, the equation gives a solution for d1 as (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). But d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and d0 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.

So, for each b, s can vary, and we can find possible s's that satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps for each s, we can find possible b's, but since the minimal b is desired, perhaps it's better to fix b and compute how many s's give valid d1 and d0.

Let me try to model this.
