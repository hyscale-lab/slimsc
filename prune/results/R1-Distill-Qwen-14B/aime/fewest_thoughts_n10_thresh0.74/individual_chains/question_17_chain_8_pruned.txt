Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, from that radius, I have to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. So, the surface area and volume are fixed for all boxes in this set. Now, we need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. That sphere is called the minimal enclosing sphere or the smallest enclosing sphere for the box.

I remember that for a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the minimal enclosing sphere must have a radius equal to half of the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal is calculated by the formula sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So, the radius r would be (1/2)*sqrt(a² + b² + c²).

So, to find r², we can compute (1/4)*(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, if I can find the minimal value of (a² + b² + c²) among all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then I can find r².

Wait, no. Wait a second. The problem says the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in B. So, we need the sphere that can contain all such boxes. But that might not necessarily be the sphere for each box individually. Hmm, no, wait. Each box is a different rectangular box, but all have the same surface area and volume. So, the sphere needs to enclose any such box. So, perhaps the minimal sphere that can contain any box from B is the sphere that can contain the "largest" box in terms of space diagonal. So, the sphere's radius would be the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B divided by 2. Therefore, r is half the maximum space diagonal. Hence, r² would be (1/4)*(max space diagonal squared).

So, to find r², I need to find the maximum value of (a² + b² + c²) given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Wait, but let me make sure. Since the sphere must contain any box from B, the sphere needs to have a radius that is at least equal to the space diagonal of every box in B. So, the minimal such sphere will have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal of any box in B. So, yes, r is the maximum of (sqrt(a² + b² + c²))/2. Therefore, r² is (max(a² + b² + c²))/4.

So, the key is to find the maximum of a² + b² + c² given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Now, given a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, and the volume V is given by abc = 23.

So, the problem reduces to optimizing a² + b² + c² with the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Hmm, so it's a constrained optimization problem. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers for this, but maybe there's a smarter way given the symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe we can express a² + b² + c² in terms of the surface area and volume. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). We know 2(ab + bc + ac) is 54, so (ab
