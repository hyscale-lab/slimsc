Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay.

First, let me try to visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid means we're moving from (0,0) to (8,8), right? So each step can either be to the right or up. But wait, the problem mentions changing direction exactly four times. So that's different from just moving right or up without changing direction too often.

Wait, so if a path changes direction four times, that means it alternates between moving right and up. For example, if it starts by moving right, then up, then right, then up, etc., each time changing direction. But how exactly does this work?

Let me think about the number of segments in the path. Each time we change direction, we start a new segment. So, if we change direction four times, that means we have five segments in total. Because the first segment is just the initial direction, and each change adds another segment. So, for four changes, five segments.

Wait, does that mean the path will have five straight lines? Each line being either all right or all up? But in an 8x8 grid, moving from (0,0) to (8,8), we need to make exactly 8 moves right and 8 moves up, but the order can vary.

So, the path is a sequence of moves, either right or up, that changes direction four times. So, the path alternates between right and up, changing direction each time. Wait, but how does that work? Let's think.

Suppose the path starts by moving right. Then, each direction change would switch to up, then right, then up, and so on. But since we have four direction changes, how many segments do we have? Five segments, as I thought earlier. So, the path would be like right, up, right, up, right, or up, right, up, right, up, etc., depending on the starting direction.

Wait, but the grid is 8x8, so each direction must sum to 8. So, the number of steps in each segment must add up to 8 in both x and y directions.

Wait, but each segment is either a horizontal or vertical line. So, if I have five segments, each segment alternates between horizontal and vertical. So, if I start with a horizontal segment, the next is vertical, then horizontal, etc. Each of these segments must have a length of at least 1, right? Because you can't have a segment of length zero.

So, to model this, perhaps I can think of it as a composition of 8 into 5 parts for the horizontal direction and similarly for the vertical direction, but alternating between horizontal and vertical segments.

Wait, let's formalize this. Let me consider two cases: starting with a horizontal move and starting with a vertical move.

Case 1: The path starts with a horizontal segment.

So, the sequence of directions is right, up, right, up, right. Since we have five segments, and we changed direction four times. But wait, does that make sense?

Wait, actually, if you start with a right segment, then the next must be up, then right, then up, then right. So, in total, three right segments and two up segments? Wait, but 3 + 2 = 5 segments. Hmm, but that's five segments, and starting with right, ending with right. Similarly, if starting with up, you'd have three up segments and two right segments.

But wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say the path starts with a right segment. Then, each direction change alternates the direction. So, after four direction changes, how many segments are right and how many are up?

Wait, the number of right segments and up segments depends on whether the number of direction changes is even or odd. Since four is even, the number of right and up segments will be equal? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, for five segments, starting with right, the sequence would be right, up, right, up, right. So, that's three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, if starting with up, it's up, right, up, right, up: three up and two right.

But in the grid, we need the total right steps to be 8 and the total up steps to be 8. So, each right segment must add up to 8, and each up segment must add up to 8 as well.

Wait, so for the case when starting with right, we have three right segments and two up segments. So, each right segment is a positive integer length, and each up segment is a positive integer length. So, the sum of the three right segments is 8, and the sum of the two up segments is 8.

Similarly, for the case starting with up, we have three up segments and two right segments, each summing to 8.

Therefore, the number of such paths in each case is equal to the number of ways to partition 8 into 3 parts (for right segments) multiplied by the number of ways to partition 8 into 2 parts (for up segments), and then multiplied by the number of ways to alternate directions, but wait, actually, the starting direction is fixed, so we don't need to multiply by that.

Wait, actually, the number of compositions. So, the number of ways to compose 8 into 3 parts is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, the number of ways to compose 8 into 2 parts is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7.

So, for the starting with right case, the number of paths is 21 * 7 = 147. Similarly, for the starting with up case, it's also 21 *7=147. So, the total number of paths is 147 +147= 294.

Wait, but hold on. Is this correct?

Wait, let me think again. Each path is a sequence of moves that changes direction four times. So, the number of direction changes is four, which means five segments. If starting with right, the number of right segments is three, and up is two. Each right segment is at least 1, so the number of compositions is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)=21, and for up, it's C(8-1,2-1)=7. So, 21*7=147 for starting right.

Similarly, starting with up, the number of up segments is three, each up segment is at least 1, so C(7,2)=21, and right segments are two, so C(7,1)=7. So, 21*7=147. So, total is 147+147=294.

But wait, the problem says "change direction exactly four times". So, is 294 the answer? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of direction changes is four. So, the path alternates between right and up five times.

Wait, but each direction change is when you switch from right to up or up to right. So, the number of times you switch is four. So, the number of times you switch direction is four, which would result in five segments.

So, the reasoning seems correct. So, the total number is 294.

But wait, let me think again about the grid. Is it an 8x8 grid, meaning the points are 9x9? Because sometimes grids are described as the number of squares, but the number of points is one more.

But in this case, the problem says an 8x8 grid, and the path is from lower left to upper right. So, the number of steps is 16, meaning 8 right and 8 up moves.

Each path is a sequence of 16 steps, 8 right and 8 up, arranged in some order. The number of such paths is C(16,8)=12870.

But we are to count only those paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, so perhaps another approach is to model the path as a sequence of moves, where a change in direction is when the next step is in a different direction than the previous one.

So, the number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches. So, for example, a path that goes right, right, up, up, right, right, etc., would have fewer direction changes.

In that case, the number of runs in the path would be the number of consecutive same-direction steps. So, each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves.

If a path has k runs, then the number of direction changes is k-1.

So, for exactly four direction changes, the number of runs is five.

Therefore, the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to have five runs, alternating between right and up, starting with either right or up.

So, the number of such paths is 2 * [C(8-1, a-1) * C(8-1, b-1)], where a and b are the number of runs for right and up.

Wait, let me be precise. If the number of runs is five, and it alternates between right and up, then the number of runs for right and up can be either three right runs and two up runs, or three up runs and two right runs.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)] = 2*(21*7)=294.

Which is what I previously calculated.

So, that seems consistent.

But wait, another way to think about it: the number of paths with exactly k runs (alternating right and up) is given by 2 * C(n-1, k1-1) * C(m-1, k2-1), where n is the number of right moves, m the number of up moves, and k1 and k2 are the number of runs in each direction, such that k1 + k2 = total runs.

In our case, n = m =8, and total runs =5. So, if starting with right, then k1=3, k2=2. So, the number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2)*C(7,1)]=294.

So, that seems solid.

But let me check with a smaller grid. Let me take a 2x2 grid, moving from (0,0) to (2,2). Let's say we want paths that change direction exactly once. So, how many such paths are there?

Well, in a 2x2 grid, a path from (0,0) to (2,2) needs two rights and two ups. To change direction exactly once, the path must have two runs. So, either right, right, up, up or up, up, right, right. Each of these has one direction change. So, how many such paths are there?

Wait, but in reality, in a 2x2 grid, the number of paths with exactly one direction change is 2: one that starts with right, then switches to up, and one that starts with up, then switches to right.

But according to our formula, n=2, m=2, k=2 runs.

So, 2 * [C(1,1)*C(1,1)] = 2*(1*1)=2. Which matches.

Another test: 3x3 grid, paths from (0,0) to (3,3) with exactly two direction changes. So, number of runs is 3.

So, the number of such paths is 2 * [C(2,2)*C(2,1)] + 2 * [C(2,1)*C(2,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, starting with right, the number of right runs is 2 and up runs is 1, or vice versa.

Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, for three runs, starting with right, the runs would be right, up, right. So, two right runs and one up run.

Similarly, starting with up, it's up, right, up: two up runs and one right run.

So, for starting with right, the number of compositions is C(3-1,2-1)=C(2,1)=2 for right runs, and C(3-1,1-1)=C(2,0)=1 for up runs. So, 2*1=2.

Similarly, starting with up, it's C(2,1)*C(2,0)=2. So, total is 2+2=4.

But let's count manually. In a 3x3 grid, how many paths with exactly two direction changes? So, each path must have three runs.

So, starting with right, the possible compositions are:

Right: 1+2 or 2+1, then up: 3, then right: ... Wait, no.

Wait, no, for starting with right, two right runs and one up run. So, the right runs sum to 3, in two parts, each at least 1. The number of compositions is C(3-1,2-1)=2. Similarly, the up run is 3, in one part: only 1 way. So, 2*1=2.

Similarly for starting with up: 2*1=2. So, total 4.

Indeed, the paths would be:

Right 1, Right 2, Up 3

Right 2, Right 1, Up 3

Up 1, Up 2, Right 3

Up 2, Up 1, Right 3

So, four paths.

Yes, that checks out. So, our formula seems correct.

So, going back to the original problem: 8x8 grid, 16 steps, four direction changes.

So, using the same reasoning, the number of such paths is 2 * [C(7,2)*C(7,1)] = 2 * 21 *7= 294.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, in the 3x3 grid example, the formula worked because n and m were equal to 3, and the number of runs were three. But in our problem, n and m are 8, and the number of runs is five. So, the formula still applies.

So, the answer is 294.

But wait, let me check if I'm missing something with the grid's size. An 8x8 grid, so from (0,0) to (8,8), which requires 8 right and 8 up moves. So, yes, the number of steps is 16, with 8 right and 8 up.

So, the only thing is whether the formula applies regardless of the grid size, as long as the number of runs is consistent.

Another way to think about it: each time you change direction, you start a new segment. So, the number of direction changes is four, so five segments. So, the path has five straight lines, alternating between right and up.

So, as long as you have five segments, the number of compositions is as we calculated.

Wait, but another thought: in the 2x2 grid example, the number of paths with exactly one direction change is two.

But according to the formula, it's 2 * [C(1,1) * C(1,1)] = 2. Which is correct.

So, same formula applies.

So, for the 8x8 grid, it should be 294.

But wait, another way to think about it is using stars and bars.

If we have five segments, starting with right, then the right segments must sum to 8, with three right segments, each at least 1. So, number of ways is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, the up segments must sum to 8, with two up segments, each at least 1. So, C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147 for starting with right. Similarly, 147 for starting with up. So, 294 total.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, I think 294 is the correct answer. So, the number of such paths is 294.


To solve the problem of counting the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths.

1. **Understanding the Grid and Movements**:  
   - The grid is 8x8, meaning we move from (0,0) to (8,8).
   - Each path consists of 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), totaling 16 moves.

2. **Direction Changes and Segments**:  
   - A path changes direction exactly four times, resulting in five segments.
   - Each segment alternates between moving right and up. For example, starting with R, the sequence would be R, U, R, U, R.

3. **Number of Segments**:  
   - If the path starts with R, there are 3 right segments and 2 up segments.
   - Similarly, if the path starts with U, there are 3 up segments and 2 right segments.

4. **Compositions of Moves**:  
   - For each direction, the number of ways to partition 8 moves into the required number of segments is given by combinations:
     - For 3 right segments: \( \binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
     - For 2 up segments: \( \binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
   - Similarly, for starting with U, the calculations are the same.

5. **Total Number of Paths**:  
   - Starting with R: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) paths.
   - Starting with U: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) paths.
   - Total paths: \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

Thus, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is \(\boxed{294}\).
