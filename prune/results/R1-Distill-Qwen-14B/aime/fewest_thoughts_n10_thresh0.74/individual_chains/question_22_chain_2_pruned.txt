Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. That means it's a special kind of hexagon, maybe something like a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all sides equal in angles. Wait, but it's equilateral, so all sides are equal in length, but angles might differ. But since opposite sides are parallel, maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon in structure, just stretched or compressed in certain directions.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I imagine extending those three sides, they meet to form a triangle. The sides of that triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon.

I think I need to visualize the hexagon and how these extensions form the triangle. In a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, and extending them would form a larger regular hexagon or maybe another similar figure. But in this case, the hexagon is equilateral but not necessarily regular, so the triangle formed might not be equilateral either.

I remember that when you have a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's called a "zonogon." But I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should just stick with the problem's given information.

Since all sides are equal, each side of the hexagon is, say, 's'. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF has sides of 200, 240, 300. I need to find 's'.

Wait, perhaps I can use similar triangles or some proportionality here. If I consider the extensions of AB, CD, and EF forming a bigger triangle, the hexagon might be similar to this triangle but scaled down.

Let me think about how the sides of the triangle relate to the hexagon. Each side of the triangle is formed by the extension of a side of the hexagon. So, for example, side AB is extended to meet another extension, say CD, to form one side of the triangle.

Since AB and CD are opposite sides of the hexagon, and they're parallel, the lines AB and CD will be cut by other sides, creating similar triangles perhaps.

Wait, maybe I should model this with coordinates. Let's place the hexagon on a coordinate system. Let me denote the hexagon as ABCDEF, with each consecutive side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA.

Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, I can assign vectors to each side. Let me denote vectors AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Since it's a hexagon, the sum of these vectors should be zero.

Given that opposite sides are parallel, vector AB is parallel to vector DE, vector BC is parallel to vector EF, and vector CD is parallel to vector FA.

Since all sides are equal in length, each vector has the same magnitude, say 's', but different directions.

Wait, but the hexagon is convex, so all internal angles are
