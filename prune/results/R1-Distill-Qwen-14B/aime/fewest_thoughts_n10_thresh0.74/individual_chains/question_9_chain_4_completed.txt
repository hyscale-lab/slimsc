Okay, so I've got this problem here: There are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logs can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties. Let me write down the given information to get a clearer picture.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

I think I can use the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So let me apply that to both equations.

For the first equation, log_x(y^x) becomes x * log_x(y). And that's equal to 10. So,

Equation 1: x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) becomes 4y * log_y(x). So,

Equation 2: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, now I have two equations involving logs with different bases. Maybe I can express these logs in terms of each other or find a relationship between x and y.

I remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So substituting into the equations:

Equation 1 becomes: x * A = 10.

Equation 2 becomes: 4y * (1/A) = 10.

So now I have:

1. x * A = 10 --> x = 10 / A.

2. 4y / A = 10 --> 4y = 10A --> y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of A. Maybe I can find A by substituting back into one of the original logarithmic expressions.

Wait, but A is log_x(y), so from Equation 1, A = 10 / x. But from x = 10 / A, I can substitute:

A = 10 / (10 / A) = A. Hmm, that just gives me A = A, which isn't helpful. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, since A = log_x(y), which can be rewritten using the change of base formula as ln y / ln x. Alternatively, A = log_x(y) = (ln y)/(ln x). Similarly, log_y(x) = (ln x)/(ln y) = 1/A.

But maybe instead of using A, I can express y in terms of x or vice versa.

Let me think. From Equation 1: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the power rule, that's x * log_x(y) = 10.

So, log_x(y) = 10 / x.

Similarly, for Equation 2: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, using the power rule, that's 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So, log_y(x) = 10 / (4y).

Now, since log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), from the reciprocal property.

So, 10 / x = 1 / (10 / (4y)).

Wait, let me write that down.

From Equation 1: log_x(y) = 10 / x.

From Equation 2: log_y(x) = 10 / (4y).

But log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), so:

10 / x = 1 / (10 / (4y)).

Simplify the right side: 1 divided by (10/(4y)) is (4y)/10.

So, 10/x = (4y)/10.

Now, let's solve for one variable in terms of the other.

Cross-multiplying: 10 * 10 = 4y * x.

So, 100 = 4xy.

Divide both sides by 4: xy = 25.

Wait, so is that it? Because the problem asks for xy, which we just got as 25.

Let me just check if this makes sense. Because sometimes when you manipulate equations, you might get an extraneous solution or make a mistake.

So if xy = 25, then let's see if there exist x and y >1 that satisfy the original logarithmic equations.

Let me try to find x and y such that their product is 25.

From earlier, we have x = 10 / A and y = (5A)/2.

Wait, perhaps I should find the value of A. But since we already found xy=25, which is the answer, maybe I don't need to go further. But just to make sure, let me see.

If xy=25, then if I let x = 5 and y=5, does that satisfy the original equations?

Wait, x=5 and y=5:

First equation: log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) = 5, because 5^5=3125. But the equation says it should be 10. So that doesn't work. Hmm, so 5 and 5 don't work. So maybe x and y are different.

Wait, perhaps different numbers. Let me think. Let me choose x=25 and y=1, but wait, y must be greater than 1, so that doesn't work either.

Wait, perhaps x=10 and y=25/10=2.5.

Let me check if x=10 and y=2.5 satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_{10}(y^x) = log_{10}(2.5^10).

2.5^10 is a bit large, but let's compute it. 2.5^10 is (5/2)^10 = 5^10 / 2^10 = 9765625 / 1024 ≈ 9536.743.

So log_{10}(9536.743) ≈ log10(10^3.979) ≈ 3.979, which is not 10. So that doesn't work either.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another method.

Since I found xy=25, perhaps to find the exact x and y, I can express y as 25/x and substitute into one of the original equations.

Let me take Equation 1: log_x(y^x) =10.

Which is x * log_x(y) =10.

But y =25/x, so log_x(25/x) =10/x.

So, log_x(25/x) =10/x.

Let me express log_x(25/x) as log_x(25) - log_x(x) because log(a/b)=log a - log b.

So, log_x(25) - 1 = 10/x.

Hmm, log_x(25) is equal to log(25)/log(x), using the change of base formula.

So, log(25)/log(x) -1 =10/x.

But 25 is 5^2, so log(25)=2 log(5).

So, [2 log(5)] / log(x) -1 =10/x.

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can let t = log(x), so that x = e^t.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can set u = log(x) with some base, but maybe it's better to express everything in terms of natural logs.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me try expressing both equations using the change of base formula.

From Equation 1: log_x(y^x)=10.

Which is x * log_x(y) =10.

Using change of base, log_x(y) = ln y / ln x.

So, x*(ln y / ln x) =10.

Similarly, from Equation 2: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Which is 4y * log_y(x) =10.

Again, log_y(x) = ln x / ln y.

So, 4y*(ln x / ln y) =10.

Now, I have two equations:

1. x*(ln y)/(ln x) =10.

2. 4y*(ln x)/(ln y) =10.

Let me denote (ln y)/(ln x) as A. Then, equation 1 becomes x*A=10, so A=10/x.

Equation 2 becomes 4y*(1/A)=10. Substituting A=10/x, equation 2 becomes 4y*(x/10)=10.

So, 4y*(x/10)=10.

Simplify: (4xy)/10 =10.

Which is (2xy)/5 =10.

Multiply both sides by 5: 2xy=50.

Divide by 2: xy=25.

So that's the same result as before. So xy=25.

But earlier, when I tried x=10 and y=2.5, it didn't satisfy. So maybe I made a mistake in that test.

Wait, let me try another approach. Since xy=25, I can let x=5, then y=5. But earlier, that didn't satisfy the first equation. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated when I tested x=10 and y=2.5. Let me check again.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = log_{10}(2.5^10).

2.5^10 is (5/2)^10 = 5^10/(2^10) = 9765625/1024 ≈ 9536.743.

Now, log base 10 of 9536.743 is log10(9536.743) ≈ 3.979, not 10. So that doesn't work.

Wait, so maybe I'm missing something here. If xy=25, but when I plug in x=10 and y=2.5, it doesn't satisfy the first equation. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me try another pair. Let me assume that x= y^k for some exponent k. Then, since xy=25, then y^(k+1)=25.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express y in terms of x as y=25/x, and substitute into the first equation.

So, equation 1: log_x(y^x)=10.

Which is log_x((25/x)^x)=10.

Which is log_x(25^x / x^x) =10.

Which simplifies to log_x(25^x) - log_x(x^x) =10.

Which is x*log_x(25) - x*log_x(x) =10.

Because log(a/b)=log a - log b, and log_x(a^b)=b*log_x(a).

Now, log_x(x)=1, so this becomes x*log_x(25) -x*1 =10.

Which simplifies to x*(log_x(25) -1 )=10.

Hmm, log_x(25) can be written as ln25 / lnx.

So, x*( (ln25 / lnx) -1 )=10.

Let me write that as x*( (ln25 - lnx) / lnx )=10.

Which is x*(ln25 - lnx)/lnx =10.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can set t=lnx, then x= e^t.

So substituting, e^t*(ln25 - t)/t =10.

So (e^t*(ln25 - t))/t =10.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can try to find t such that (e^t*(ln25 - t))/t =10.

This looks transcendental, so perhaps it's difficult to solve algebraically. So maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the two initial equations again.

We have:

1. x * log_x(y) =10.

2. 4y * log_y(x) =10.

And we found that xy=25.

So, if I can express log_x(y) in terms of xy, which is 25.

Wait, from equation 1: log_x(y) =10/x.

But log_x(y) is also equal to ln y / ln x.

So, ln y = ln x * (10/x).

But y=25/x, so ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x.

So, setting equal:

ln25 - lnx = (10/x) * lnx.

Hmm, so ln25 = (10/x +1) * lnx.

Let me write that as:

ln25 = lnx * (10/x +1).

Hmm, this still seems difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe I can make a substitution.

Let me let u = lnx. Then, x = e^u.

So, substituting, we have:

ln25 = u * (10/(e^u) +1).

Hmm, this equation might not have a closed-form solution, so perhaps I can use numerical methods or make an intelligent guess.

Wait, let's try to guess some x and y where xy=25, and see if they satisfy the original logarithmic equations.

Let's pick x=5. Then y=5, because 5*5=25.

Check equation 1: log_5(5^5)=log_5(3125)=5, but equation says 10. So that doesn't work.

Next, try x=25, y=1, but y must be greater than 1, so no.

How about x= sqrt(25)=5, which I already tried. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe x=25^(1/4)= (5^2)^(1/4)=5^(1/2)=sqrt(5)≈2.236. Then y=25/(sqrt(5))=5*sqrt(5)≈11.180.

Check equation 1: log_x(y^x)= log_{sqrt(5)}( (5 sqrt(5))^{sqrt(5)} ).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using natural logs.

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) =10.

So, with x=sqrt(5), y=5*sqrt(5).

log_x(y) = ln y / ln x = ln(5*sqrt(5)) / ln(sqrt(5)).

Compute numerator: ln(5*5^(1/2))= ln(5^(3/2))= (3/2) ln5.

Denominator: ln(5^(1/2))= (1/2) ln5.

So, log_x(y)= (3/2 ln5)/(1/2 ln5)= 3.

So, x * log_x(y)= sqrt(5)*3 ≈2.236*3≈6.708, which is not 10. So that's not good.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's go back to the two equations:

Equation 1: x * log_x(y)=10.

Equation 2: 4y * log_y(x)=10.

Let me express both logs in terms of natural logs.

Equation 1: x*(ln y / ln x) =10.

Equation 2:4y*(ln x / ln y)=10.

Let me denote ln x as a and ln y as b. So, x = e^a and y = e^b.

Substituting into the equations:

1. e^a * (b / a) =10.

2.4 e^b * (a / b) =10.

So, equation 1: (e^a * b)/a =10.

Equation 2: (4 e^b * a)/b =10.

Let me write them as:

1. (e^a b)/a =10.

2. (4 e^b a)/b =10.

Hmm, perhaps I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

From equation 1: (e^a b)/a =10 --> e^a b =10a --> b = (10a)/e^a.

From equation 2: (4 e^b a)/b =10.

Substituting b from equation 1 into equation 2:

(4 e^b a) / ( (10a)/e^a ) ) =10.

Simplify denominator: (10a)/e^a.

So, numerator is 4 e^b a.

So, [4 e^b a] / [ (10a)/e^a ] ) =10.

Simplify:

[4 e^b a * e^a ] / (10a) )=10.

Cancel a in numerator and denominator:

4 e^{a + b} /10 =10.

Multiply both sides by 10:

4 e^{a + b}=100.

Divide by 4:

e^{a + b}=25.

Take natural log:

a + b= ln25.

But from equation 1, b = (10a)/e^a.

So, a + (10a)/e^a = ln25.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation in terms of a. It might not have an analytical solution, so I might have to find a numerical solution.

Let me denote f(a) = a + (10a)/e^a - ln25.

We need to find a such that f(a)=0.

Let me compute f(a) for different a values.

First, let's note that ln25 is approximately 3.2189.

Let me try a=2:

f(2)= 2 + (20)/e^2 ≈2 + 20/(7.389) ≈2 + 2.708 ≈4.708. That's greater than 3.2189.

a=3:

f(3)=3 + (30)/e^3 ≈3 + 30/20.085 ≈3 +1.493≈4.493. Still greater.

a=4:

f(4)=4 + (40)/e^4 ≈4 +40/54.598≈4 +0.733≈4.733. Hmm, still too high.

Wait, but when a increases, (10a)/e^a decreases, so maybe I should try lower a.

Wait, a=1:

f(1)=1 +10/e≈1 +10/2.718≈1+3.679≈4.679. Still high.

a=0.5:

f(0.5)=0.5 +5/(sqrt(e))≈0.5 +5/1.6487≈0.5+3.035≈3.535>3.2189.

a=0.3:

f(0.3)=0.3 + (3)/e^{0.3}.

e^{0.3}=1.34986.

So, 3/1.34986≈2.223.

So, f(0.3)=0.3+2.223≈2.523<3.2189.

So, between a=0.3 and a=0.5, f(a) crosses zero.

Let me try a=0.4:

e^{0.4}=1.4918.

f(0.4)=0.4 + (4)/(1.4918)≈0.4 +2.681≈3.081 <3.2189.

a=0.45:

e^{0.45}=1.5683.

f(0.45)=0.45 + (4.5)/(1.5683)≈0.45 +2.873≈3.323>3.2189.

So, between 0.4 and 0.45.

We have f(0.4)=3.081, f(0.45)=3.323.

We need f(a)=3.2189.

Let me try a=0.43.

e^{0.43}= e^0.4 * e^0.03≈1.4918 *1.03045≈1.5375.

f(0.43)=0.43 + (4.3)/1.5375≈0.43 +2.800≈3.230. Close to 3.2189.

So, a≈0.43.

Let me try a=0.425.

e^{0.425}= e^{0.4}*e^{0.025}≈1.4918 *1.0253≈1.529.

f(0.425)=0.425 + (4.25)/1.529≈0.425 +2.777≈3.202. Close to 3.2189.

So between 0.425 and 0.43.

Let me try a=0.428.

e^{0.428}= e^{0.42}*e^{0.008}.

e^0.42≈1.522, e^0.008≈1.008.

So, 1.522*1.008≈1.533.

f(a)=0.428 + (4.28)/1.533≈0.428 +2.791≈3.219≈3.2189.

Perfect. So a≈0.428.

So, a = ln x ≈0.428 --> x≈e^{0.428}≈1.534.

Then, from equation 1, b = (10a)/e^a.

a=0.428, e^a≈1.534.

So, b≈(10*0.428)/1.534≈4.28/1.534≈2.791.

So, b=ln y≈2.791 --> y≈e^{2.791}≈16.21.

So, x≈1.534, y≈16.21.

Check if xy≈1.534 *16.21≈24.85≈25, which matches.

Now, let's check the original equations to see if they hold.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Compute y^x: 16.21^1.534.

Hmm, 16^1.5 is 64, since 16^1=16, 16^0.5=4, so 16^1.5=64. 16.21^1.534 would be slightly larger, maybe around 64.5 or so.

Now, log base x (which is ~1.534) of y^x (which is ~64.5) is equal to log_{1.534}(64.5).

Hmm, let's compute that.

Since 1.534^10 ≈ (1.534)^10.

But 1.534^2≈2.353, 1.534^4≈(2.353)^2≈5.535, 1.534^5≈5.535 *2.353≈13.01, 1.534^10≈(13.01)^2≈169.26.

Wait, but 1.534^10≈169, which is larger than 64.5, so log_{1.534}(64.5) would be less than 10.

Wait, that's a problem because the first equation says it should be 10.

Hmm, maybe my approximations were off. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a. Let me check it again.

Wait, when I used a=0.428, e^{0.428} is approximately 1.534. So, x=1.534.

Then, from equation 1, log_x(y) =10/x=10/1.534≈6.519.

So, log_x(y)=6.519 implies that y=x^{6.519}= (1.534)^{6.519}.

Let me compute that. Let's compute ln y=6.519 * ln x=6.519 *0.428≈2.791.

So y≈e^{2.791}≈16.21, which matches earlier.

So, y=16.21.

Now, y^x=16.21^{1.534}.

Let me compute ln(16.21^{1.534})=1.534 * ln(16.21).

ln(16.21)≈2.788.

So, 1.534*2.788≈4.281.

Thus, ln(y^x)=4.281, so y^x≈e^{4.281}≈73.7.

So, log_x(y^x)=ln(y^x)/ln x=4.281 /0.428≈10.0, which matches the first equation.

Similarly, check the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

x^{4y}=1.534^{4*16.21}=1.534^{64.84}.

Compute ln(x^{4y})=64.84 * ln(1.534)=64.84*0.428≈27.83.

Thus, x^{4y}=e^{27.83}.

Then, log_y(x^{4y})=ln(x^{4y})/ln y=27.83/2.788≈10.0, which matches the second equation.

Ah, so my earlier mistake was miscalculating 16.21^1.534 as approximately 64.5, but actually, it's around 73.7, which makes the log base x to be 10.

So, all checks out.

Thus, the product xy is indeed 25.


We are given that real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, satisfy the equations:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]
We aim to find the product \( xy \).

### Step 1: Apply Logarithm Properties
Using the logarithm power rule, we rewrite the given equations:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10,
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10.
\]

### Step 2: Express in Terms of Each Other
Let \( A = \log_x(y) \). Then, \( \log_y(x) = \frac{1}{A} \) by the reciprocal property of logarithms.

Substituting into the equations:
\[
x \cdot A = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{10}{A},
\]
\[
4y \cdot \frac{1}{A} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{5A}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Relate \( x \) and \( y \)
We now have expressions for \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( A \):
\[
x = \frac{10}{A}, \quad y = \frac{5A}{2}.
\]
The product \( xy \) is:
\[
xy = \left(\frac{10}{A}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{5A}{2}\right) = \frac{50A}{2A} = 25.
\]

### Step 4: Verify Consistency
To ensure consistency, we substitute back into the original equations. For example, choosing \( x = 1.534 \) and \( y = 16.21 \) (which satisfy \( xy = 25 \)), we verify:
\[
\log_{1.534}(16.21^{1.534}) = 10,
\]
\[
\log_{16.21}(1.534^{4 \cdot 16.21}) = 10.
\]
Both equations hold true, confirming the solution.

### Final Answer
The product \( xy \) is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
