Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits (0-9) in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right, the two numbers add up to 999, and when I read them top to bottom, the three numbers add up to 99. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's 2 rows and 3 columns. So, each row will form a three-digit number when read left to right. Let me denote the top row as A, B, C and the bottom row as D, E, F. So, the first number is ABC (which is 100*A + 10*B + C) and the second number is DEF (100*D + 10*E + F). According to the problem, ABC + DEF = 999.

Then, for the vertical reading, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is AD (10*A + D), the second column is BE (10*B + E), and the third column is CF (10*C + F). Their sum should be 99. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Okay, so I have two equations:

1. 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999
2. 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Wait, let me write that more clearly.

Equation 1: (100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999

Equation 2: (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99

I need to find how many possible digit combinations (A,B,C,D,E,F) satisfy both these equations.

Hmm. Let me try to manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Let me denote the numbers formed by the rows as N1 = ABC and N2 = DEF. So, N1 + N2 = 999.

Similarly, the numbers formed by the columns are M1 = AD, M2 = BE, M3 = CF. So, M1 + M2 + M3 = 99.

I think I can express the second equation in terms of N1 and N2.

Wait, let me think. How are the horizontal and vertical sums related?

Looking at the vertical sum: each digit in the top row (A, B, C) is part of a two-digit number with the corresponding bottom digit (D, E, F). So, M1 is 10A + D, M2 is 10B + E, M3 is 10C + F.

So, the sum of M1, M2, M3 is 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F).

But from the horizontal sum, N1 + N2 = 999. Let me express N1 and N2:

N1 = 100A + 10B + C

N2 = 100D + 10E + F

So, N1 + N2 = 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Let me denote S = A + B + C and T = D + E + F.

Then, the vertical sum is 10S + T = 99.

And the horizontal sum is 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Wait, let me express the horizontal sum in terms of S and T as well.

Wait, 100A + 10B + C is equal to 100A + 10B + C = 100A + 10B + C. Similarly, 100D + 10E + F.

So, N1 + N2 = 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can subtract the vertical sum from the horizontal sum.

Wait, let's see:

Horizontal sum: 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

Vertical sum: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Let me subtract the vertical sum from the horizontal sum:

(100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F) - (10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F) = 999 - 99

Calculating left side:

100A - 10A = 90A

10B - 10B = 0

C - 10C = -9C

100D - D = 99D

10E - E = 9E

F - F = 0

So, altogether: 90A -9C +99D +9E = 900

Let me factor out 9:

9*(10A - C +11D + E) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10A - C + 11D + E = 100

Hmm, that's an equation: 10A - C + 11D + E = 100.

So, that's equation 3.

Now, from the vertical sum, I had:

10S + T = 99, where S = A+B+C and T = D+E+F.

So, 10(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99.

But from the horizontal sum, N1 + N2 = 999.

Wait, perhaps I can also express N1 and N2 in terms of S and T?

Wait, N1 = 100A + 10B + C = 100A +
