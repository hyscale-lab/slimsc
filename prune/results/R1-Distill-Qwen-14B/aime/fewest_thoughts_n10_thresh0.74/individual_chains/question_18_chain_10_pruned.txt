Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles in a regular dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, right? So it's a 12-sided polygon. The question is about rectangles where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

Wait, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting certain diagonals. But I'm not exactly sure how to approach this for a dodecagon. Let me think.

First, maybe I should consider how rectangles are formed in a regular polygon. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides are all equal and angles are equal, but the diagonals can vary in length. So, in a regular polygon, the sides and certain diagonals can be parallel.

I think the key is to find pairs of parallel sides and pairs of parallel diagonals that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. So, for a rectangle, we need two sets of parallel lines, each set consisting of two lines, and their intersections should form right angles.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, not all diagonals are parallel. Some diagonals are longer than others, and their angles might not necessarily be right angles. Hmm, maybe I need to figure out which diagonals are parallel and which intersect at right angles.

I remember that in regular polygons with n sides, the number of sides and diagonals that are parallel can be determined based on how the vertices are spaced. For a regular polygon, two diagonals are parallel if the number of vertices they skip is the same.

So, in a regular dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 11 other vertices. The sides are the ones that connect adjacent vertices, and the diagonals connect vertices with one or more vertices in between.

But for two diagonals to be parallel, the step between the vertices should be the same. For example, in a regular hexagon, the long diagonals are all parallel because they connect every other vertex. Similarly, in a regular dodecagon, diagonals that skip the same number of vertices are parallel.

So, I need to categorize the diagonals based on how many vertices they skip. Let's think about the dodecagon as having vertices labeled 0 to 11 in a clockwise direction.
