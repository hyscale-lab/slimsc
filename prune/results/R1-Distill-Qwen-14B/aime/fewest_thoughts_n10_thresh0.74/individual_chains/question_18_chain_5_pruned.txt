Okay, so I've got this problem: find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with even sides, rectangles can be formed by connecting certain vertices. But I need to figure out how exactly to count them all.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees. Now, when the problem says each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal, that probably means that the sides of the rectangle are either edges of the dodecagon or lines connecting non-adjacent vertices.

I think rectangles in a regular dodecagon can be formed by selecting four vertices such that the opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. Because in a regular polygon, if two sides are parallel, the other two must also be parallel to form a rectangle.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. So, the key here is probably to figure out how many pairs of parallel sides and diagonals exist, and then determine how these can form rectangles.

Let me try to think about how rectangles are formed in regular polygons. For a rectangle to exist, there must be two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a dodecagon, this is possible because you can have diameters (lines connecting opposite vertices) which are straight lines. So, if I have a diameter, maybe that can serve as a diagonal of a rectangle.

Wait, but a rectangle needs four sides, so maybe if I pick two diameters that are perpendicular to each other, their intersection would form a rectangle? No, that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon.

Another approach: In a regular polygon, the number of rectangles can be calculated by considering the number of ways to choose two distinct pairs of parallel chords. Each pair of parallel chords would form opposite sides of the rectangle. So, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel chords that are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, so perhaps I need to count how many pairs of parallel chords there are, and then see how many of them are perpendicular. But this seems a bit vague. Maybe I should think about the symmetry of the dodecagon.

A regular dodecagon has 12 sides, so it has rotational symmetry of order 12 and reflectional symmetry across multiple axes. Each vertex is equidistant from the center. So, perhaps the rectangles are determined by selecting four points such that the vectors between them are perpendicular and of the same length.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a unit circle, with each vertex at an angle of 30 degrees apart (since 360/12 = 30). Then, the coordinates of each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°.

If I can express the sides and diagonals as vectors between these points, then maybe I can find vectors that are perpendicular and of equal length, which would form the sides of a rectangle.

But this might get complicated. Perhaps there's a combinatorial way to approach this problem.

Let me recall that in a regular polygon with n sides, the number of rectangles can be calculated based on the number of pairs of perpendicular diameters or something like that. But wait, in a dodecagon, the number of diameters is 6, since each diameter connects two opposite vertices.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, each diameter connects a vertex to the one opposite it, so since there are 12 vertices, there are 6 diameters.

So, each diameter is a straight line passing through the center, connecting two opposite vertices.

If I have
