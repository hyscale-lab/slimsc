Okay, so I've got this problem here about points O, A, and B on a coordinate plane. O is at (0,0), which is the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0). And B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is on the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, and the length PQ is 1. So these are like line segments that start at some point P on the x-axis, go to some point Q on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is exactly 1.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is part of the family F, right? Because A is on the x-axis and B is on the y-axis, and the distance between A and B is 1. Let me check that. The distance between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] which is sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, C is a point on AB, not A or B, that isn't on any other segment from F. So, my goal is to find the coordinates of C, compute OC squared, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q. Then, compute p + q.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out which point on AB is only intersected by AB among all these possible segments PQ in F. So, for any other PQ in F, C should not lie on PQ. So, C is somehow the only point on AB that's not intersected by any other PQ segments.

How should I approach this?

First, maybe I can parametrize the segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be represented parametrically. Let me write the parametric equations.

Let’s let t go from 0 to 1, where t=0 is at A and t=1 is at B. So, the parametric equations would be:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, for t in [0,1], we get all the points on AB.

So, any point C on AB can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

Our point C is unique in that it's only on AB and no other PQ from F. So, for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, for all other PQ, the line PQ doesn't pass through C except when PQ is AB itself.

So, to find C, perhaps I can find the point on AB that is the envelope of all these segments PQ, or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where the distance from O to AB is maximized or minimized, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. Each PQ is a segment of length 1, with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis. So, for each PQ, the equation of the line PQ is x/a + y/b = 1, where a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept, and the distance from P(a, 0) to Q(0, b) is sqrt(a² + b²) = 1.

So, for each PQ, we have a line x/a + y/b = 1, with a² + b² = 1.

So, all such lines PQ are tangent to the unit circle centered at the origin? Wait, no, because the distance from the origin to the line x/a + y/b = 1 is |0 + 0 - 1| / sqrt( (1/a)^2 + (1/b)^2 ). But since a² + b² = 1, maybe there's a relationship here.

Alternatively, perhaps each line PQ is a tangent to some curve.

Wait, no, not necessarily. Let me think: For any PQ, a and b are positive real numbers such that a² + b² = 1.

So, each PQ is the line x/a + y/b = 1, with a² + b² = 1.

So, the set of all such lines is a family of lines in the first quadrant, each cutting the x-axis at a and y-axis at b, with a² + b² =1.

Therefore, the family F consists of all such lines.

So, each PQ is a line x/a + y/b = 1, where a² + b² =1, and a, b >0.

So, one approach could be to find the envelope of this family of lines. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.

In this case, since the family of lines is x/a + y/b = 1 with a² + b² =1, the envelope might be a circle or some other conic section.

But wait, in our problem, the point C is on AB and is not on any other PQ except AB. So, C is the point where AB is the only line from F that passes through it. So, in terms of the envelope, maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope curve.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is another curve, and C is the point where AB meets this envelope.

Wait, let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member at some point. So, for each line in F, the envelope is a curve that touches each line at exactly one point.

So, if I can find the envelope of the family F, then the point C would be where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because then, for any other line in F, it wouldn't pass through C, as C is only on AB and the envelope.

So, let's try to find the envelope.

The family is given by F_t: x/a + y/b =1, where a² + b² =1.

But since a² + b² =1, we can write b² =1 - a².

But perhaps it's better to parameterize the family in terms of a single parameter.

Let me use a parameter θ such that a = cosθ and b = sinθ, since a² + b² =1. So, θ will be from 0 to π/2.

So, our family becomes x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1, for θ in (0, π/2).

So, now, to find the envelope, we can use the method of differentiating the equation with respect to the parameter θ and solving the two equations.

The envelope satisfies both the original equation and the derivative with respect to θ.

So, let me write F(θ) = x/cosθ + y/sinθ -1 =0.

Compute dF/dθ:

dF/dθ = x sinθ / cos²θ - y cosθ / sin²θ = 0.

So, set both F(θ)=0 and dF/dθ=0.

So, equations:

1. x / cosθ + y / sinθ =1
2. x sinθ / cos²θ - y cosθ / sin²θ =0

We can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of θ.

Let me denote equation 2 as:

x sinθ / cos²θ = y cosθ / sin²θ

So, cross-multiplying:

x sin³θ = y cos³θ

So, equation 2: x = y (cos³θ)/(sin³θ) = y cot³θ.

Let me plug this into equation 1.

Equation 1: (y cot³θ)/cosθ + y / sinθ =1

Simplify:

y (cot³θ / cosθ) + y / sinθ =1

Express cotθ as cosθ/sinθ.

So, cot³θ = (cos³θ)/(sin³θ)

So,

y ( (cos³θ)/(sin³θ) ) / cosθ + y / sinθ =1

Simplify the first term:

y (cos²θ)/(sin³θ) + y / sinθ =1

Factor out y / sinθ:

y / sinθ [ cos²θ / sin²θ + 1 ] =1

Note that cos²θ + sin²θ =1, so cos²θ =1 - sin²theta.

Wait, in the bracket: [ cos²θ / sin²theta + 1 ] = [ (1 - sin²θ) / sin²theta + 1 ] = [ 1/sin²theta - 1 + 1 ] = 1/sin²theta.

So, the equation becomes:

y / sintheta * (1 / sin²theta
