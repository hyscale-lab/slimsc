Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize and understand the problem step by step.

First, the problem mentions two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle, which suggests that these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. 

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the longer side, 107 units, and BC is 16 units. So, AB is the base, BC is the height.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is the base, which is much longer, 184 units, and FG is the height, 17 units.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine both rectangles, their sides must be aligned in such a way that these points lie on the same line. 

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. 

Hmm, I think I need to find the positions of these points and perhaps use some circle theorems or properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. Let me think about how to model this.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, all angles are right angles. So, AD is perpendicular to DC, and so on. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so all its angles are right angles.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to make this more concrete. Coordinates might help me calculate distances and figure out relationships.

Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0, 0), then point C, which is adjacent to D, can be at (x, 0). Wait, but I know BC is 16. Wait, maybe I should define the coordinates more carefully.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, the sides are AB = 107, BC =16, CD=107, DA=16. So, if I place point A at (0, 0), then point B is at (107, 0). Point C would be at (107, 16), and point D at (0, 16). Wait, no, that can't be right because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. Wait, no, perhaps I should rethink the coordinate system.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to place point D at (0, 0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (a, 0), point B at (a, b), and point A at (0, b). Wait, let me think.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, points are labeled in order, so AB is adjacent sides. So, if I have points A, B, C, D in order, then AB is one side, BC is the next, etc.

Let me assign coordinates:

Let me set point A at (0, 0). Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC is 16, so moving up from B, point C is at (107, 16). Then, point D would
