Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, alright. Let me try to unpack this.

First, the problem involves finding triples (a, b, c) where each of a, b, c are nonnegative integers. They need to satisfy two conditions: their sum is 300, and the sum of certain terms involving their squares and products is 6,000,000.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find the number of such triples.

Let me think about how to approach this. The first equation is linear, the second is quadratic but a bit more complicated. Maybe I can manipulate these equations to find some relationship between a, b, and c.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, that looks like it can be factored or rewritten in a more manageable form.

Wait a second, notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. So, for example, a²b is a * a * b. Similarly for the others.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me try to factor it.

Looking at the terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the second equation can be written as:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that seems a bit better, but still complex. Maybe I can express b + c, a + c, a + b in terms of the first equation.

From the first equation, a + b + c = 300, so:

b + c = 300 - a
a + c = 300 - b
a + b = 300 - c

So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's another way to write it. Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Which simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm. Not sure if that's directly helpful yet.

I know that for symmetric equations, sometimes it's useful to consider symmetric sums. Let me recall that:

(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So from the first equation, (a + b + c)² = 300² = 90,000.

So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

Which means that a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300
P = ab + bc + ca (the sum of the products)
Q = abc (the product)

I remember that for symmetric sums, we can also express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, P, and Q.

The formula is: a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S P + 3Q

Wait, let me verify that. Yes, because:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a), but I think the correct formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (
