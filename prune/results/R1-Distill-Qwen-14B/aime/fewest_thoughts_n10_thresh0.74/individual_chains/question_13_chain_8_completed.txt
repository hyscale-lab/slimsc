Okay, so I have this problem about Aya walking every morning. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She has two different walking speeds, and each time she stops at a coffee shop for t minutes. The problem gives me two scenarios:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, her entire walk takes 4 hours, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop.
2. When she walks faster, specifically at s + 2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes at the coffee shop.

The question is asking me to find the total time her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find how long the walk takes at this new speed, s + 1/2 km/h. But to do that, I think I need to figure out what s is first because without knowing her original speed, I can't find the next one.

Let me think about the first scenario. The walk is 9 km at s km/h. The time taken for the walk itself would be distance divided by speed, right? So that's 9 / s hours. But the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, but t is in minutes, and the walking time is in hours. I should convert everything to the same units to avoid confusion. Let's convert t minutes to hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, in the first scenario, the walking time plus the coffee time equals 4 hours. So:

Walking time + Coffee time = Total time
(9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 km/h, so the walking time is 9 / (s + 2) hours. Again, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. So:

(9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

Now, I have two equations:

1. (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4
2. (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

Hmm, so both equations have (t / 60) as a term. Maybe I can subtract the two equations to eliminate t.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4
Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(9/s - 9/(s+2)) + (t/60 - t/60) = 4 - 2.4
So, 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Simplify the left side. Let's factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s+2). That's (s + 2 - s) / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Which simplifies to:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Now, solve for s. Let me write that as:

18 = 1.6 * s * (s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 times s(s + 2). 1.6 is the same as 8/5, so maybe I can write it as fractions to make it easier.

Wait, 18 = (8/5) * s (s + 2)

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominator:

90 = 8 s (s + 2)

So, 8 s(s + 2) = 90

Divide both sides by 2:

4 s(s + 2) = 45

Hmm, wait, 8 s(s + 2) = 90, so s(s + 2) = 90 / 8 = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

I can solve this using the quadratic formula. Let's write it as:

s = [-2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-11.25) ) ] / (2 * 1)

Compute discriminant:

(2)^2 = 4

4 * 1 * 11.25 = 45

So discriminant is 4 + 45 = 49

So, sqrt(49) = 7

Thus, s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:

s = ( -2 +7 ) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5

s = ( -2 -7 ) / 2 = (-9)/2 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, 2.5 km/h seems a bit slow for a walking speed, but okay, maybe she walks slowly.

So, s = 2.5 km/h

Now, I need to find t. Let's plug s back into one of the equations.

Using equation 1:

9/s + t/60 = 4

s=2.5, so 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours

So, 3.6 + t/60 = 4

t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4

t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes

So, t is 24 minutes.

Okay, now that I have s and t, the next part is to find how long the walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

s is 2.5, so s + 1/2 is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her new speed is 3 km/h.

The walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Including the coffee time of t =24 minutes, total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes. 180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, but the problem says to include t minutes in the walk time. So the total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is 204 minutes.

Alternatively, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 is 204 minutes.

Alternatively, I can present it as 3 hours and 24 minutes, but since the question asks for the number of minutes, including t, which is 24 minutes, it's 204 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

First, s =2.5, s+2=4.5.

Check equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

9/4.5 = 2 hours. t/60 = 24/60 = 0.4 hours. 2 + 0.4 = 2.4. So yes, correct.

So, when she walks at s + 1/2 =3 km/h, walking time is 9/3=3 hours, which is 180 minutes.

Plus t=24 minutes, so total 204 minutes.

So the answer is 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we first determine Aya's walking speed \( s \) and the time \( t \) she spends at the coffee shop. 

From the first scenario:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
From the second scenario:
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]
Subtracting the two equations to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
Simplifying:
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6 \implies \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6 \implies s(s+2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
We find \( s = 2.5 \) km/h (since speed cannot be negative). Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation gives \( t = 24 \) minutes.

When walking at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]
Including the coffee shop time:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{204}
\]
