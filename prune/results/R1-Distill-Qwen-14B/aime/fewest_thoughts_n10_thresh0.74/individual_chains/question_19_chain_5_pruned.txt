Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC, with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. The goal is to find AB multiplied by AC.

Let me jot down what I know:

1. O is the circumcenter, so it's the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle. The circumradius R is 13, so OA = OB = OC = 13.

2. I is the incenter, which is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The inradius r is 6. So, the distance from I to each side is 6.

3. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I.

I need to find AB · AC. Hmm, that's the product of two sides. In triangle problems, sometimes using the formula involving sides and angles can help. For example, AB = 2R sin C, AC = 2R sin B, so AB · AC = 4R² sin B sin C. But I'm not sure if that's the way to go here. Maybe, but let's see what other information I have.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can find some relationship between the distances or angles in the triangle. Let me try to visualize or draw a rough sketch.

In triangle ABC, O is the circumcenter, I is the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, if I connect O and I, and then draw IA, it should form a right angle at point I.

Wait, no, actually, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is the segment from O to I. So, IA is perpendicular to OI, which means that at point I, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees.

So, triangle AIO is a right triangle at I. So, AI is perpendicular to OI.

That's a key piece of information. So, in triangle AIO, AI is perpendicular to OI, which is the segment connecting the incenter and circumradius.

Wait, but O is the circumradius center, so O can be inside or outside the triangle depending on whether the triangle is acute or obtuse. Similarly, I is always inside the triangle.

But in any case, triangle AIO is a right triangle with right angle at I.

So, in triangle AIO, we have:

- AI is one leg,

- OI is the other leg,

- AO is the hypotenuse, which is equal to R, the circumradius, so AO = 13.

Wait, AO is the distance from A to O, which is the circumradius, so yes, AO = 13.

So, in the right triangle AIO, with right angle at I, we have AO² = AI² + OI².

So, 13² = AI² + OI².

But I don't know AI or OI yet. However, I do know the inradius r is 6. The inradius is the distance from the incenter I to any side of the triangle, so in particular, the distance from I to BC is 6.

But AI is the distance from A to I, which isn't directly the inradius. Wait, AI isn't the inradius; the inradius is the distance from I to the sides. So, AI is a different length.

But maybe I can find AI in terms of other quantities.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles or sides. Let me recall the formula for AI.

I think the formula for the length of the angle bisector from A to the inradius is AI = r / sin
