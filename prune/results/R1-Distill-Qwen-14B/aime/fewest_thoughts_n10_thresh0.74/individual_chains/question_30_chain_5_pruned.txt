Alright, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the remainder when a certain product is divided by 1000. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says, "Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000."

Okay, so ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because it's a 13th root and not equal to 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. 

The expression I need to compute is the product of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. Hmm, that's a lot of terms. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since ω is a root of unity, maybe I can find a pattern or simplify the expression somehow. Let me consider each term in the product. For each k, the term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to a known polynomial identity.

Wait, let's see. Let me denote x = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². Let's write that as x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, is that a quadratic that can be factored or has roots that I can find?

Let me calculate the discriminant of this quadratic: D = ( -2 )² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are (2 ± sqrt(-4))/2 = (2 ± 2i)/2 = 1 ± i. So the roots are complex numbers 1 + i and 1 - i.

So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, substituting back x = ω^k, each term becomes (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, now the product over all k from 0 to 12 is the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Hmm. That looks like two separate products multiplied together. Let me write it as [product (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product (ω^k - (1 - i))].

So, I have two products: one is the product over all 13th roots of unity (except ω^0=1, but wait, k=0 is included, so ω^0=1 is part of the product). So, the product is over all ω^k from k=0 to 12, which are all the 13th roots of unity.

Wait, but 1 is included because when k=0, ω^0=1. So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity of (x - (1 + i)) and similarly for (x - (1 - i)).

Wait, wait, more accurately, in the product, each term is (ω^k - a) where a is a constant, so the product over all roots of unity of (x - a) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are the roots of unity. But wait, actually, the product over all ω^k for k=0 to n-1 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x^n - 1. Because the roots of x^n - 1 are exactly the n-th roots of unity.

So, in this case, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x
