Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be expressed in a specific form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p.

First, let me write down the given edge lengths to make sure I have them right:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, interesting. So each pair of opposite edges has the same length. That probably means the tetrahedron has some symmetry. I think such a tetrahedron is called "isohedral" or maybe "edge-transitive," but I'm not entirely sure. But the key point is that opposite edges are equal, which might help in calculating the volume or other properties.

Since I'm dealing with a tetrahedron, the first thing that comes to mind is to calculate its volume, because the formula for the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) is related to the volume and the surface area. I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. So, r = 3V / A_total, where V is the volume and A_total is the sum of the areas of all four faces.

So, my plan is:

1. Calculate the volume V of the tetrahedron.
2. Calculate the areas of all four faces.
3. Sum the areas to get A_total.
4. Plug into r = 3V / A_total.

But to do that, I need to figure out the volume. Since I don't have coordinates for the vertices, maybe I can use the formula involving the edge lengths. I recall that for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths, the volume can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me try to remember how that works.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, in this problem, the edges are:

AB = √41 → a² = 41

AC = √80 → b² = 80

AD = √89 → c² = 89

BC = √89 → d² = 89

BD = √80 → e² = 80

CD = √41 → f² = 41

So, plugging these into the Cayley-Menger matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me double-check that:

- Row 0 is always 0,1,1,1,1
- Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² → 1, 0,41,80,89
- Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² → 1,41,0,89,80
- Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD² → 1,80,89,0,41
- Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0 → 1,89,80,41,0

Yes, that looks correct.

So, now I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That's going to be a bit of work. Let me see if I can write it out:

The matrix is:

0  1    1    1    1
1  0   41   80   89
1 41    0   89   80
1 80   89    0   41
1 89   80   41    0

Computing the determinant of a 5x5 matrix manually is going to be really time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if some rows or columns are similar, allowing for easier calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to exploit the symmetry of the tetrahedron. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is symmetric enough that the determinant can be calculated more easily.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a known formula or a resource to compute this determinant. But since I'm supposed to be figuring this out, let me try to compute it step by step.

First, remember that the determinant of a matrix can be calculated by expanding along any row or column. Maybe expanding along the first row, which has a zero and four ones, which might make the calculation easier.

The determinant of the matrix can be calculated as follows:

det(CM) = 0 * M00 - 1 * M01 + 1 * M02 - 1 * M03 + 1 * M04

Where M0j is the minor corresponding to the element in the first row and j-th column.

But since the first element is 0, that term goes away. So,

det(CM) = -1 * M01 + 1 * M02 - 1 * M03 + 1 * M04

Each minor M0j is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing the first row and the j-th column.

So, let's compute each minor:

First, M01: remove first row and first column. Wait, wait, when j=1, we remove first row and first column. Wait, the first row is row 0, and the first column is column 0.

Wait, the matrix is 5x5, with rows 0 to 4 and columns 0 to 4. So, when expanding along row 0, the element at (0,1) is 1, and the minor M01 is the determinant of the matrix with row 0 and column 1 removed.

So, M01 is the determinant of:

Row 1: 1,41,80,89

Row 2: 1,0,89,80

Row 3: 1,89,0,41

Row 4: 1,80,41,0

Wait, no. Wait, when you remove row 0 and column 1, the remaining matrix is:

Columns 0,2,3,4.

So, the matrix is:

Row 1: 1 (column 0), 80 (column 2), 89 (column3), 89 (column4)? Wait, no:

Wait, original matrix:

Row 0: 0,1,1,1,1

Row 1:1,0,41,80,89

Row 2:1,41,0,89,80

Row 3:1,80,89,0,41

Row 4:1,89,80,41,0

So, removing row 0 and column 1, the remaining entries are:

Row 1: columns 0,2,3,4: 1,41,80,89

Row 2: columns 0,2,3,4: 1,0,89,80

Row 3: columns 0,2,3,4:1,89,0,41

Row 4: columns 0,2,3,4:1,80,41,0

So, M01 is the determinant of:

1 41 80 89

1 0 89 80

1 89 0 41

1 80 41 0

Hmm, that's a 4x4 determinant. Let me denote this as M1.

Similarly, M02 is the minor for element (0,2), which is 1, so we remove row 0 and column 2. The remaining matrix is:

Row 1: columns 0,1,3,4: 1,0,80,89

Row 2: columns 0,1,3,4:1,41,89,80

Row 3: columns 0,1,3,4:1,80,0,41

Row 4: columns 0,1,3,4:1,89,41,0

So, that's:

1 0 80 89

1 41 89 80

1 80 0 41

1 89 41 0

Similarly, M03 is for element (0,3), which is 1. So, remove row 0 and column 3.

The remaining matrix is:

Row 1: columns 0,1,2,4: 1,0,41,89

Row 2: columns 0,1,2,4:1,41,0,80

Row3: columns 0,1,2,4:1,80,89,41

Row4: columns 0,1,2,4:1,89,80,0

So, that's:

1 0 41 89

1 41 0 80

1 80 89 41

1 89 80 0

And M04 is for element (0,4), remove row 0 and column4.

So:

Row1: 1,0,41,80

Row2:1,41,0,89

Row3:1,80,89,0

Row4:1,89,80,41

So, that's:

1 0 41 80

1 41 0 89

1 80 89 0

1 89 80 41

Hmm, calculating four 4x4 determinants is going to be tedious, but maybe some of them are similar or can be simplified.

Looking at M01 and M04, they seem similar but with some transposed elements.

Wait, perhaps M01 and M04 are transposes? Because M01 is the determinant when removing column1, which is the second column, and M04 is removing column4, which is the fifth column. So, maybe they aren't transposes, but perhaps they have some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe M01 = M04, but I need to check.

Wait, let's compute one minor and see if others can be related.

Let me first compute M01:

M01 matrix:

1  41  80  89

1   0   89  80

1  89   0   41

1  80   41   0

This seems a bit complex, but perhaps I can perform row operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract the first row from the others to create zeros.

Let me denote the rows as R1, R2, R3, R4.

So, R1: 1,41,80,89

R2:1,0,89,80

R3:1,89,0,41

R4:1,80,41,0

Compute R2 = R2 - R1:

R2: (1-1, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89) → (0, -41, 9, -9)

Similarly, R3 = R3 - R1:

(1-1,89-41,0-80,41-89) → (0,48,-80,-48)

R4 = R4 - R1:

(1-1,80-41,41-80,0-89) → (0,39,-39,-89)

So, the matrix becomes:

R1:1,41,80,89

R2:0,-41,9,-9

R3:0,48,-80,-48

R4:0,39,-39,-89

Now, the determinant remains the same after these row operations. Now, since the first column has a 1 followed by zeros, expanding along the first column might be easier.

The determinant of a 4x4 matrix can be calculated by expanding along the first column.

The determinant is:

1 * det(minor of R1C1) - 0 + 0 - 0 = det(minor of R1C1)

So, the minor is the 3x3 matrix:

-41   9   -9

48  -80  -48

39  -39  -89

So, now compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.

Let me write it out:

| -41   9    -9 |

| 48  -80   -48 |

| 39  -39   -89 |

Calculating this determinant:

= -41 * [(-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39)] - 9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39] + (-9) * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: -41 * [ (80*89) - (48*39) ]

Wait, wait, no: the first minor is for element -41, so it's the determinant:

| -80  -48 |

| -39  -89 |

Which is (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) = 7120 - 1872 = 5248

Second term: -9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39]

Wait, the minor for the 9 is:

|48  -48 |

|39  -89 |

Which is 48*(-89) - (-
