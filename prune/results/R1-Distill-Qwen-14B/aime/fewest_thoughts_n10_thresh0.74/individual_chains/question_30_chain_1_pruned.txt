Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation ω^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1 and ω^k ≠ 1 for 0 < k < 13.

The product given is from k=0 to 12, which makes sense because there are 13 roots, so the product is over all the 13th roots of unity. The expression inside the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. I need to compute this product and then find its remainder modulo 1000.

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 would give me the minimal polynomial for ω, which is x^13 - 1. But here, the expression is different: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to something I know.

Let me consider the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can write this as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set z = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z², which is the same as z² - 2z + 2. So, each term in the product is z² - 2z + 2, where z is ω^k.

Wait, so the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (z² - 2z + 2), where z = ω^k. But ω is a primitive 13th root, so as k goes from 0 to 12, z goes through all the 13th roots of unity.

Is there a way to express this product as a value of a polynomial evaluated at certain points? Let's think about how products over roots relate to polynomials.

The product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, as I mentioned before. But here, each term is (z² - 2z + 2), which is a quadratic in z. Maybe I can relate this product to evaluating a polynomial at specific points.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the product as the value of some resultant or something similar. Hmm, not sure about that. Let me think differently.

Since z is a 13th root of unity, then z^13 = 1. So, maybe I can consider the polynomial f(z) = z² - 2z + 2 and see if it has any relation to z^13 - 1.

Wait, another approach: since the product is over all 13th roots of unity, I can think of it as the product of f(z) as z runs over all roots of z^13 - 1 = 0. But f(z) is a quadratic, and the product would then be the product of f(z) over all roots of z^13 - 1.

But how can I compute that? I remember that if you have a polynomial P(z), and you take the product over all roots α of Q(z)=0 of P(α), then this product is equal to the resultant of P and Q, or something like that. Alternatively, it's the product of P evaluated at each root of Q.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms? But
