Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me break it down and try to figure out what's going on.

First, the problem says it's a convex equilateral hexagon, ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, okay. So in a hexagon, opposite sides would be AB and DE, BC and EF, and CD and FA, I think. Since all opposite sides are parallel, this must be a special kind of hexagon. Maybe something like a regular hexagon, but not necessarily with all sides equal in angles, just opposite sides equal and parallel.

Wait, but it's equilateral, so all the sides are equal in length. That's interesting. So each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA has the same length, let's call it 's'. But the angles might not all be equal, just the sides are equal. Because it's convex, so all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. So I need to visualize this. Let me try to imagine the hexagon. Since opposite sides are parallel, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they should form a triangle. Each of these sides is extended until they meet, forming a larger triangle, and the lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

I think this triangle is called the "outer triangle" or something like that, formed by extending the sides of the hexagon. So AB is extended beyond A and B, CD is extended beyond C and D, and EF is extended beyond E and F, and these extensions meet at certain points forming a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300.

Wait, but how exactly are they extended? Since AB, CD, EF are opposite sides, and they are all parallel to their opposites, so extending AB would mean going beyond A and B, but since opposite sides are parallel, the direction of the extension should be similar.

Let me think about how this triangle is formed. If I have AB, CD, and EF, each of these is a side of the hexagon, and their extensions meet at three points forming a triangle. Each side of this triangle is an extension of one of these sides.

But wait, AB, CD, and EF can't all be extended in the same direction, so perhaps each side is extended beyond one of its endpoints to form the triangle. Hmm, maybe each side is extended beyond the vertex that's closer to the center of the hexagon.

So, for example, AB is extended beyond A, CD is extended beyond C, and EF is extended beyond E, and these three extended lines meet at three points forming a triangle. Or maybe it's extended beyond B, D, F? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe the extensions of AB, CD, and EF meet pairwise to form the triangle. So, the extension of AB meets the extension of CD at one vertex of the triangle, the extension of CD meets the extension of EF at another, and the extension of EF meets the extension of AB at the third.

Since all opposite sides are parallel,
