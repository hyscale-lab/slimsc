Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. 

First, the problem says: We have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let's start by understanding the figure. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, ABC is a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 

The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents? Wait, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. That makes triangle DBC an isosceles triangle with DB = DC.

Then, line AD is drawn, and it intersects the circle ω again at point P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle. The goal is to find AP.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to find AP in terms of the given sides. Since we have the lengths of all sides of triangle ABC, maybe we can find some relations using power of a point, similar triangles, or something like that.

Let me recall that when dealing with tangents and secants, the power of a point comes into play. The power of point D with respect to ω can be expressed in two ways: as DB² and DC² (since DB = DC, they are both equal to the power of D). Also, since AD is a secant that intersects ω at A and P, the power of D should also be equal to DA * DP.

Wait, let's write that down. Power of point D: DB² = DA * DP. So, DB squared equals DA times DP.

But we don't know DA or DP. Hmm. Maybe we can express DA in terms of AP, since AP is the length we're trying to find. Let me denote AP as x. Then, since AD is the entire length from A to D, and P is a point on AD inside the circle, AP = x and PD = AD - AP. But wait, actually, since P is the second intersection point, AD is longer than AP. So, AD = AP + PD. Therefore, if AP is x, then PD is AD - x. But we don't know AD yet.

Alternatively, maybe we can express AD in terms of other known quantities. Hmm, perhaps using coordinates or trigonometric relations? That might get complicated, but let's see.

Alternatively, maybe we can use Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem. Or perhaps use the concept of harmonic division. Wait, another thought: since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, maybe triangle BDC is related to triangle ABC somehow.

Wait, let's think about the properties of point D. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsimilicenter or the symmedian point? Or perhaps, no, wait, the exsimilicenter is related to homothety, but maybe that's too advanced.

Alternatively, maybe we can use inversion. Inversion with respect to the circle ω could swap points B and C and their tangents. Hmm, but maybe that's overcomplicating things.

Let me try to compute some lengths. Maybe I can compute the circumradius of triangle ABC first. If I have the sides, I can compute the area and then the circumradius.

Given triangle ABC, sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let's compute the semi-perimeter first: s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 12.

Then, using Heron's formula, area = sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 6] = sqrt[504]. Let me compute sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5, wait no, 504=16*31.5 is not correct. Let me factor 504: 504 = 16 * 31.5 is not correct. Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which
