Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me try to understand what a b-eautiful integer is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if when expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Moreover, the sum of these two digits should equal the square root of n. Oh, and there's an example given: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

So, to break it down, n is a two-digit number in base b. That means n can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero, and both a and c must be less than b. Also, the sum of the digits a + c should equal sqrt(n), which is an integer because n is a perfect square.

So, let's formalize this a bit. If n is a two-digit number in base b, then:

n = a * b + c

where 1 ≤ a < b and 0 ≤ c < b. Also, the sum of the digits is a + c, and this should equal sqrt(n). Therefore:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But since n = a * b + c, substituting the sqrt(n) gives:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a * b + c

Let me rearrange this equation:

a² + 2ac + c² - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can collect like terms. Let's see:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So, for given b and c, a must satisfy this equation. But since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square.

Let me compute the discriminant D:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (c² - c)

Expanding that:

D = 4c² - 4b c + b² - 4c² + 4c

Simplify:

D = (-4b c + b²) + 4c

Factor:

D = b² - 4b c + 4c

Hmm, so D must be a perfect square for a to be an integer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this differently. Since a + c = sqrt(n) and n = a*b + c, then:

sqrt(n) = a + c
n = (a + c)^2

So, n = (a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Which can be written as:

a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c

Bring all terms to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Wait, similar to before. Let me factor this equation in terms of a:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

Yes, same as before.

So, for each base b, we can iterate over possible c values (from 0 to b-1) and solve for a in the quadratic equation. If a is an integer between 1 and b-1, then n is a b-eautiful integer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this equation differently. Let me think.

From n = (a + c)^2 = a*b + c, so:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me subtract c from both sides:

(a + c)^2 - c = a*b

Which gives:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Hmm, that seems interesting. So, b has to be equal to [(a + c)^2 - c] divided by a, and both a and c are digits in base b, so a < b and c < b.

Since a and c are digits in base b, a must be at least 1, and c can be from 0 to b-1.

Wait, but maybe I can fix some variables here. Let me consider that a and c can vary, but b is determined by a and c.

But since we're looking for the minimal b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers, perhaps I can find for each b, how many pairs (a, c) satisfy the equation a + c = sqrt(n) and n = a*b + c.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of a and c.

Since n = (a + c)^2 = a*b + c, we can solve for b:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Simplify numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a² + 2a c + c² - c

So,
