Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the circumradius (R) is 13, so that's given. The inradius (r) is 6. The incenter is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. If IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a key piece of information. Maybe there's a relationship between the inradius, circumradius, and the sides of the triangle.

I think I should draw a diagram to visualize this. So, triangle ABC with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, maybe I can use some properties of these centers and the distances between them.

I recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check that. Yes, that's the formula. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2 times r). Plugging the values in, R is 13, r is 6. So, OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Wait, so that's the distance between O and I.

But how does that help me? The problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is a line from O to I (which is at the origin), and IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe O lies somewhere along the x-axis or y-axis? Wait, if I is at (0,0), and IA is perpendicular to OI, then O must lie somewhere along the line perpendicular to IA at I.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use vectors or coordinate geometry with O at (0,0). Hmm, perhaps that's
