Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let's write down what's given:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I'm trying to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

Looking at the second equation, it seems symmetric in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor it somehow or express it in terms of symmetric sums. Let's see.

I notice that a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, the other terms can be factored in the same way:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). So substituting these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that might be helpful. Let me write that out:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Expanding each term, we get:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Which simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. I wonder if I can relate this to other symmetric sums. I know that in symmetric equations, sometimes we can express things in terms of elementary symmetric sums like a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, and abc.

Given that a + b + c = 300, let's denote S1 = a + b + c = 300.

I also know that the sum of squares is S2 = a² + b² + c². There's a formula that relates S2 to S1 and the sum of products:

S2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S1² - 2P, where P = ab + bc + ca.

Similarly, the sum of cubes can be expressed using the formula:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = S1³ - 3S1P + 3Q, where Q = abc.

So, let me write down these expressions:

S2 = S1² - 2P = 300² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P

Sum of cubes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S1³ - 3S1P + 3Q = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q

Calculating 300³: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q

Now, going back to the equation I had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting S2 and sum of cubes:

300*(90,000 - 2P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2P):

= 300*90,000 - 300*2P
= 27,000,000 - 600P

Then subtract (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q):

So,

(27,000,000 - 600P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000

Let's distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q = 6,000,000

Simplify terms:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) - 3Q = 6,000,000

Which simplifies to:

0 + 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000

So,

300P - 3Q = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000

So, we have:

100P - Q = 2,000,000   --> Equation (1)

Now, I have two equations:

1. S1 = a + b + c = 300
2. 100P - Q = 2,000,000

Additionally, I know that P = ab + bc + ca and Q = abc.

Hmm, so perhaps I can consider the elementary symmetric sums. If I can express P and Q in terms of some variables, maybe I can find possible values for a, b, c.

Wait, but with three variables, this might be a bit tricky. Maybe I can think of the variables as roots of a cubic equation. Let me recall that for variables a, b, c, they are roots of the equation:

x³ - S1 x² + P x - Q = 0

Which is:

x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0

From equation (1), I have 100P - Q = 2,000,000, which can be rearranged as Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, substituting Q into the cubic equation:

x³ - 300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, perhaps factor the terms involving P:

x³ - 300x² + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

I wonder if I can factor this equation further. Alternatively, maybe I can express P in terms of x? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the equation. Let's try to collect terms:

x³ - 300x² + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not obvious. Maybe another approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps all variables are equal? Let's test if a = b = c.

If a = b = c, then each is 100, since 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.

Then, let's compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= 6*(100² * 100) = 6*(1,000,000) = 6,000,000

Which matches the given condition. So, a = b = c = 100 is a solution. But are there others?

Wait, perhaps solutions where two variables are equal and the third is different?

Let me consider that case. Let's assume a = b, then c = 300 - 2a.

Substituting into the second equation:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a

Wait, let's compute each term:

a²b = a³
a²c = a²c
b²a = a³
b²c = a²c
c²a = c²a
c²b = c²a

So, adding them up:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a = 2a³ + 2a²c +
