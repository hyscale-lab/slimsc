Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis with length 2a, where a²=20, so a=√20, which is about 4.472. The conjugate axis is along the y-axis with length 2b, where b²=24, so b=√24, approximately 4.899.

The problem mentions points A, B, C, and D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD, with the diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals are along the axes? Hmm, not necessarily, but since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, it's symmetric about the origin.

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. But no, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, actually, no—rhombus diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, for a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, the rhombus is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis. Therefore, the vertices of the rhombus are positioned such that if one vertex is at (p, q), the opposite vertex is at (-p, -q), and the other two vertices are at (r, s) and (-r, -s), where (r, s) is another point on the hyperbola.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Since it's a rhombus, all four sides are equal, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the points are such that each point is a reflection across the origin of another point. So,
