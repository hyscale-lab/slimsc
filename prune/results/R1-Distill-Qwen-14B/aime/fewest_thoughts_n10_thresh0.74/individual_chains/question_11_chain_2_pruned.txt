Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

First, let me understand what is given. \( z \) is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. So \( |z| = 4 \) means that if \( z = a + bi \), then \( a^2 + b^2 = 16 \). But maybe it's easier to represent \( z \) in polar form because dealing with magnitudes and angles might be more straightforward here.

Right, so any complex number \( z \) can be written as \( z = r e^{i\theta} \) where \( r = |z| \) and \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), we can write \( z = 4 e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) ranges from 0 to \( 2\pi \).

Given that, let's rewrite the expression. The first part is \( (75 + 117i)z \). Substituting \( z = 4 e^{i\theta} \), this becomes \( (75 + 117i) \times 4 e^{i\theta} \).

The second part is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Since \( z = 4 e^{i\theta} \), its reciprocal is \( \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \). So the second term becomes \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute these two terms separately.

Starting with the first term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4 e^{i\theta} \). Multiplying 4 into the complex number: 75 * 4 = 300, 117 * 4 = 468. So this becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \).

Similarly, the second term: 96 divided by 4 is 24, and 144 divided by 4 is 36. So that's \( 24 + 36i \) multiplied by \( e^{-i\theta} \).

So, the entire expression is \( (300 + 468i) e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \).

Hmm, okay. So now I have the expression in terms of \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \). Maybe I can express these exponentials in terms of cosine and sine to make it easier to compute the real part.

Recall that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, let's substitute these into the expression.

First, expand \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Multiplying out, this is:

300 * cosθ + 300 * i sinθ + 468i * cosθ + 468i * i sinθ.

Simplify each term:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + (468i^2) sinθ.

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), the last term becomes -468 sinθ.

So, combining real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

Similarly, expand the second term \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Multiplying out:

24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Simplify each term:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ (since \( i^2 = -1 \)).

Combine real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

Now, add the two expanded expressions together.

First, adding the real parts from both terms:

Real part of first term: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Real part of second term: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So total real part: (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Similarly, adding the imaginary parts:

Imaginary part of first term: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

Imaginary part of second term: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

Total imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ - 24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

Simplify that:

( (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ ) i = (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i.

But since we're only interested in the real part of the whole expression, we can focus on 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum real part, which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. We need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies from 0 to 2π.

Hmm, okay, so this is a function of θ: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. The maximum value of such an expression can be found using the amplitude method. Remember that any expression of the form \( a \cosθ + b \sinθ \) can be rewritten as \( R \cos(θ - φ) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( φ = \arctan(b/a) \) or something like that. The maximum value is then R, since the cosine function has a maximum of 1.

Wait, but in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is like \( a \cosθ + b \sinθ \) with a = 324 and b = -432.

So, R would be \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2:

324 * 324. Let's see, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576. Then cross terms: 2*300*24 = 14,400. So (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2 is 432*432. Hmm, 400^2 is 160,000, 32^2 is 1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

But since 432 is negative in our expression, we have (-432)^2 = 186,624.

So R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Let's see, 500^2 is 250,000. 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2 is 250,000, 40^2 is 1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000, so (500+40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) is 540.

So R is 540. Therefore, the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as R cos(θ + φ), or R cos(θ - φ), depending on how we set it up. But regardless, the maximum value is R, which is 540.

So, the maximum real part of the given expression is 540.

But wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes sign errors or calculation mistakes can happen.

First, the expression after substitution was (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Then, expanding both terms:

First term expansion: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ + 4
