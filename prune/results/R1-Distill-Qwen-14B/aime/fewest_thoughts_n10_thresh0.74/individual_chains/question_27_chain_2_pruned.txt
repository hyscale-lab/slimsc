Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6 units. So, the torus has a major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) of 6, and a minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) of 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. When the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's on the outside, externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what it means for the torus to be tangent to the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere, it touches the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it touches along another circle. These circles of tangency will have certain radii, r_i and r_o.

I remember that for a torus, the surface can be described using two radii: R (the major radius, the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and r (the minor radius, the radius of the tube itself). In this case, R is 6, and r is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has a radius of 11. So the torus must fit inside the sphere, touching it at some point. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus must enclose the sphere, touching it along another point.

Wait, but in both cases, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. That means that along that circle, both surfaces share a common tangent plane. So, the points of tangency lie on a circle, and the centers of the sphere and the torus must align in some way with that circle.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first.

Case 1: Torus inside the sphere.

The sphere has radius 11. The torus is inside and tangent to the sphere. The center of the sphere is at some point, and the torus is centered at a point relative to the sphere.

Wait, but I think the sphere and the torus are concentric? Or not necessarily? Hmm, maybe not necessarily. Because when the torus is inside, it's touching the sphere along a circle, which might be equatorial or at some other latitude.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify their positions, so perhaps we can assume that the torus is centered at the same point as the sphere. That would make the problem symmetric.

I think that's a safe assumption because otherwise, the problem would have more variables. So, let me proceed under the assumption that the sphere and torus are concentric.

So, the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is also centered at the origin. Now, when the torus
