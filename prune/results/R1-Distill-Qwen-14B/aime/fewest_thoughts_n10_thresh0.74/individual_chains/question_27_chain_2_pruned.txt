Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize what's going on here. The torus T is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6 units. So, it's like a donut shape where the radius of the circular cross-section is 3, and the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6. 

The sphere S has a radius of 11. Now, the torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent to it along a circle, which is the internal tangent case, giving a radius r_i. Alternatively, the torus can rest outside the sphere and be tangent along another circle, the external tangent case, giving a radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I think I should start by recalling some properties of tori and spheres. A torus is a surface of revolution, so it has a major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) and a minor radius (the radius of the generating circle). In this case, major radius R is 6, and minor radius r is 3.

The sphere has a radius of 11, so its equation in 3D space would be x² + y² + z² = 11², but maybe I can think about it in a cross-sectional view since we're dealing with circles of tangency.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the centers must be aligned. Similarly, when it's outside, the same applies. So, perhaps I can model this with circles in 2D since the problem is symmetric. Let me imagine a cross-section where the torus appears as two circles (the cross-section of the donut shape) and the sphere as a larger circle.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the torus as a surface with two important radii. The major radius (6) and minor radius (3). The sphere has radius 11.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere must be equal to the radius of the sphere minus the distance from the center of the torus to the sphere's center. Wait, not exactly sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus, and relate it to the tangent circles.

Wait, the torus is a surface, so when it's tangent to the sphere, the point of tangency is along a circle. The sphere and the torus are both surfaces of revolution, so their intersection (the tangent circle) lies in a plane. The radius of this circle can be found by considering the cross-section.

Maybe I can model this in 2D. Let's imagine the cross-sectional view where the sphere is a circle of radius 11, and the torus appears as two circles (each of radius 3) centered at a distance of 6 from the axis. Wait, no, in cross-section, a torus would appear as a circle of radius 3, but when you cut it through the axis, it's like two circles each of radius 3, separated by a distance of 12 (since the major radius is 6, so the centers are 12 apart). Hmm, maybe not exactly, but perhaps I can think of the cross-section as a circle of radius 3, but offset by 6 units from the origin.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the torus parametrically. The equation of a torus is usually given in terms of (
