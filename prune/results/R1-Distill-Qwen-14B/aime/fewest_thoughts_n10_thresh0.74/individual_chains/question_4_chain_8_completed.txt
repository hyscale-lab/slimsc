Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, so I remember this is a combinatorial game theory problem. The key is to figure out for each n whether the first player (Alice) or the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

I think I should model this using the concept of "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Let's try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation for these positions.

So, let's define:

- If a player can move to a losing position for the opponent, then the current position is a winning position.
- If all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent, then the current position is a losing position.

We can start by examining small values of n and see if we can spot a pattern.

Let me create a table for n from 0 upwards, marking each as a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n=0: Well, if there are no tokens left, the game is over. But wait, n=0 is when the previous player has taken the last token and won. So for n=0, the current player can't make a move, meaning it's a losing position. Wait, but if n=0 is the starting point, it's actually when the game is over. So maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

- If n=0, the player whose turn it is loses because they can't make a move. So n=0 is a losing position (L).

But let's see:

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is W.

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position for them. But wait, is there another option? They can take 1 or 4. But n=2, taking 4 isn't possible. So the only move is to take 1, leaving n=1 (W) for the opponent. So the current player can force the opponent into a W position, which is bad for the opponent. Wait, wait, no. Because if I leave the opponent in a W position, that means the opponent can win from there. So if I leave the opponent in a W position, that's bad for me. So n=2: if I take 1, opponent is at W, so opponent can win. So n=2 is L? Or am I getting this backwards.

Wait, maybe I should define it more carefully.

- If from n, you can move to at least one L position, then n is W.

- If all moves from n lead to W positions, then n is L.

So let's compute step by step.

n=0: L (no moves possible)

n=1: Can take 1 to reach n=0 (L). So n=1 is W.

n=2: Taking 1 leads to n=1 (W). Taking 4 isn't possible. So all moves lead to W. So n=2 is L.

n=3: Taking 1 leads to n=2 (L). So n=3 is W.

n=4: Can take 1 (leading to n=3, W) or 4 (leading to n=0, L). Since taking 4 leads to L, n=4 is W.

n=5: Taking 1 leads to n=4 (W). Taking 4 leads to n=1 (W). All moves lead to W, so n=5 is L.

n=6: Taking 1 leads to n=5 (L). So n=6 is W.

n=7: Taking 1 leads to n=6 (W), taking 4 leads to n=3 (W). All moves lead to W, so n=7 is L.

n=8: Taking 1 leads to n=7 (L). So n=8 is W.

n=9: Taking 1 leads to n=8 (W), taking 4 leads to n=5 (L). So since taking 4 leaves opponent at L, n=9 is W.

n=10: Taking 1 leads to n=9 (W), taking 4 leads to n=6 (W). So all moves lead to W, so n=10 is L.

n=11: Taking 1 leads to n=10 (L). So n=11 is W.

n=12: Taking 1 leads to n=11 (W), taking 4 leads to n=8 (W). So all moves lead to W. So n=12 is L.

Hmm, let me list these out:

n | Position (W/L)
0 | L
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10| L
11| W
12| L
...

Looking at this, I can try to see if there's a pattern.

Let me list the losing positions (L) so far: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12,...

Wait, the differences between losing positions:

0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to 7: +2

7 to 10: +3

10 to 12: +2

12 would go to 15? Let's check n=13 and 14.

n=13: Taking 1 leads to n=12 (L). So n=13 is W.

n=14: Taking 1 leads to n=13 (W), taking 4 leads to n=10 (L). So since taking 4 leads to L, n=14 is W.

Wait, but according to our earlier pattern, after 12, the next L would be 12+3=15?

Wait, but let's compute n=15.

n=15: Taking 1 leads to n=14 (W); taking 4 leads to n=11 (W). So all moves lead to W, so n=15 is L.

So yes, the L positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22, etc.

Looking at the L positions, what's the pattern? The intervals alternate between adding 2 and 3.

0 +2 =2; 2+3=5; 5+2=7;7+3=10;10+2=12;12+3=15;15+2=17;17+3=20;20+2=22;22+3=25; etc.

So the losing positions are numbers that are 0 mod 5? Wait, let's see. 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...

Wait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...

Wait, perhaps these are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5, but no, let's see:

Wait 0 mod5 is 0.

2 mod5 is 2.

5 mod5 is 0.

7 mod5 is 2.

10 mod5 is 0.

12 mod5 is 2.

15 mod5 is 0.

17 mod5 is 2.

20 mod5 is 0.

22 mod5 is 2.

25 mod5 is 0.

27 mod5 is 2.

So yes, all numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.

Wait, let's test this. For n=5, which is 0 mod5, it's L. n=2 is 2 mod5, L. n=7 is 2 mod5, L. n=10 is 0 mod5, L. n=12 is 2 mod5, L. n=15 is 0 mod5, L. So yes, it seems that the losing positions are n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, is that true? Let me check n=20, which is 0 mod5, L. n=22 is 2 mod5, L. So it's consistent.

So if the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5, then Bob can win if n is a losing position, because Alice is forced to move from a losing position to a winning position, allowing Bob to always move back to a losing position.

Wait, but wait a second. In the game, we start with n tokens, and Alice moves first. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position n must be a losing position. Because if the starting position is a losing position, then whatever Alice does, Bob can respond to bring it back to a losing position, etc., until Bob takes the last token.

Wait, no, wait: in the problem statement, it's Alice who goes first. So if n is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) is in a losing position, which means Bob can win.

So the number of n ≤2024 where n is a losing position (i.e., n ≡0 or 2 mod5) is the answer.

So how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 or 2 mod5?

Let me compute that.

First, let's find the numbers ≡0 mod5 up to 2024.

The numbers are 0,5,10,...,2020. Since 2020 is 5*404.

So the count is 404 numbers (since 0 is included, but the problem specifies positive integers, so n starts at 1. Wait, but n=5,10,...,2020 are the numbers ≡0 mod5 and positive. So how many?

From 5 to 2020, step 5: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1 = 403 +1=404 numbers.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: 2,7,12,..., up to the largest ≤2024.

What's the last term ≤2024? Let's compute 2024 divided by 5.

2024 ÷5 is 404.8. So 5*404=2020, so the next number after 2020 is 2025, which is beyond 2024.

Wait, so numbers ≡2 mod5 go up to 2022? Because 2022 = 5*404 + 2 = 2020+2=2022.

So the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

How many terms? The first term is 2, last term is 2022, common difference 5.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

Wait, wait: Let me check.

The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/d) +1.

So (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

So numbers ≡0 mod5: 404 numbers.

Numbers ≡2 mod5: 405 numbers.

So total numbers where n is a losing position is 404+405=809.

Wait, but wait: 5*404=2020, so the last term in 0 mod5 is 2020, which is ≤2024. So 404 terms.

For 2 mod5, the last term is 2022, which is also ≤2024. So 405 terms.

So total 404+405=809.

Wait, but let's confirm: 2024 is the maximum n. So 2024 mod5 is 2024/5=404*5=2020, 2024-2020=4. So 2024≡4 mod5.

So the last term for 2 mod5 is 2022, which is 2022=5*404 +2=2020+2=2022.

Yes, that's correct.

So the total number is 404+405=809.

Wait, but let me check if 2024 is included in either. 2024 is 4 mod5, so it's neither 0 nor 2 mod5, so it's not included in the count.

So the answer is 809.

But wait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, the initial positions up to n=15: L positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15.

Which are 0,2 mod5. So the analysis seems correct.

Therefore, the number of n ≤2024 where n is L is 809.

So the answer is \boxed{809}


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using winning (W) and losing (L) positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

We start by examining small values of \( n \) and identifying patterns:

- \( n = 0 \): L (no move possible)
- \( n = 1 \): W (take 1 token)
- \( n = 2 \): L (only move leads to W)
- \( n = 3 \): W (take 1 token to L)
- \( n = 4 \): W (take 4 tokens to L)
- \( n = 5 \): L (all moves lead to W)
- \( n = 6 \): W (take 1 token to L)
- \( n = 7 \): L (all moves lead to W)
- \( n = 8 \): W (take 1 token to L)
- \( n = 9 \): W (take 4 tokens to L)
- \( n = 10 \): L (all moves lead to W)

Continuing this analysis, we observe that the losing positions occur at \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \).

To find the total number of such \( n \leq 2024 \):

1. **Numbers \( \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \):**
   - The sequence is \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \).
   - Number of terms: \( \frac{2020}{5} = 404 \).

2. **Numbers \( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \):**
   - The sequence is \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \).
   - Number of terms: \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \).

Summing these, the total number of losing positions is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{809}\).
