Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. That probably means their graphs are V-shaped or something similar.

Let me sketch f(x) first. Starting with |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This would shift the graph down by 1/2, but since the absolute value can't be negative, it will create a V that touches the x-axis at x = ±1/2. Then taking the absolute value again, ||x| - 1/2|, which I think just reflects any negative parts back up. Wait, but |x| - 1/2 is always non-negative when |x| ≥ 1/2. For |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 would be negative, so the absolute value would flip it to positive. So f(x) is a V-shape that has vertices at x = ±1/2, y = 0, and between -1/2 and 1/2, it's a V pointing downward? Or maybe not, let me think.

Wait, no. Let me plot f(x) step by step. For x ≥ 0, f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So that's a V-shape with a vertex at x = 1/2, y = 0. Similarly, for x ≤ 0, f(x) = | -x - 1/2| = |x + 1/2|, so vertex at x = -1/2, y = 0. So overall, f(x) is a W shape? No, wait, because for x ≥ 0, it's |x - 1/2|, and for x ≤ 0, it's |x + 1/2|. So from x=0 to x=1/2, it's a line going from (0, 1/2) down to (1/2, 0). Similarly, from x=0 to x=-1/2, it goes from (0, 1/2) down to (-1/2, 0). So the graph of f(x) is a diamond shape with vertices at (1/2, 0), (-1/2, 0), and (0, 1/2). Wait, no, because f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|, which for any x, whether positive or negative, is the same as | |x| - 1/2 |. So when x is between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| is less than 1/2, so | |x| - 1/2 | is 1/2 - |x|, which is a downward slope from (0, 1/2) to (1/2, 0) and similarly on the negative side. For |x| > 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is positive, so f(x) is |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape opening upwards. So the graph of f(x) is a combination of two Vs: one pointing down between -1/2 and 1/2, and two pointing up outside that interval.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Let's think about that. For |x| ≥ 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is non-negative, so g(x) is |x| - 1/4. For |x| < 1/4, g(x) is 1/4 - |x|. So the graph of g(x) is similar but with a smaller dip. It will have a V pointing down between -1/4 and 1/4, peaking at (0, 1/4), and Vs pointing up outside that.

So both f and g are piecewise linear functions with specific vertices. Now, the functions we have in the problem involve compositions of these functions with sine and cosine, and then scaling by 4.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, for the first equation, y is determined by plugging sin(2πx) into f, then into g, and then scaling by 4. Similarly, for the second equation, x is determined by plugging cos(3πy) into f, then into g, and scaling by 4.

Since both equations involve functions of x and y, and we're looking for their intersections, which are the points (x, y) that satisfy both equations.

So, to find the number of intersections, I need to solve the system:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))  
x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, the variables x and y are interconnected through these equations.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can analyze the ranges of these functions to get an idea of how many solutions are possible.

First, note that both sin and cos functions have outputs in [-1, 1]. So sin(2πx) is in [-1, 1], and so is cos(3πy).

Let's think about the composition f(sin(2πx)). Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1.

So, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Similarly, g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|.

Wait, no, f(sin(2πx)) is already non-negative since it's
