Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 give Bob a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, so I think this is a combinatorial game theory problem. The key here is to figure out the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, to model this, I should probably start by looking at small values of n and see if I can find a pattern or recurrence relation.

Let me make a table for small n and note whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a W for Alice, so Bob can't win if n=1.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take 1 and win. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice would not want to do that. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n is 2, so she can't take 4. So Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So for n=2, Alice is forced to let Bob win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: the player to take the last token wins. So if it's Alice's turn and n=2, she can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't win in n=2, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find positions where Bob can win regardless of Alice's play, which would mean that for those n, Bob can force a win. So for n=2, Bob can win. So n=2 is a Bob-win position.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of P-positions and N-positions. P-positions are those where the previous player can force a win, meaning the next player cannot, regardless of what they do. N-positions are those where the next player can force a win.

Wait, no, that might be the other way around. Wait, let's get clear: in combinatorial game theory, usually, P-positions are losing positions for the player about to move, and N-positions are winning for the player about to move.

So, in this problem, a position n is a P-position if the current player cannot force a win, regardless of what the opponent does. So if n is a P-position, then the current player will lose if both play optimally.

So I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a P-position because that would mean that when Bob is the second player, Alice is faced with a P-position, meaning she can't force a win, so Bob can. So the question is, for which n is the starting position a P-position when Bob is the second player, meaning Alice is starting from a P-position. Wait, no, perhaps I should model it as the starting player (Alice) being in position n, and if n is a P-position, then Alice can't win, so Bob can. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a P-position.

So, let's try to find the P-positions for this game.

Let me start by listing the positions from n=0 upwards.

n=0: No tokens left. The game is over. So if a player is faced with n=0, they lost. So n=0 is a losing position, but it's a terminal state.

n=1: The current player can take 1 and win. So n=1 is a winning position (N-position).

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. Alternatively, can't take 4, so only option is to take 1. So the current player leaves n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. That means n=2 is a losing position (P-position).

n=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is a P-position, losing for the opponent). So the current player can force a win by taking 1. So n=3 is a winning position (N-position).

n=4: Current player can take 4 and win. So n=4 is a winning position (N-position).

n=5: Current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (winning for the opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=1 (winning for the opponent). So n=5: any move leaves the opponent in a winning position. So n=5 is a losing position (P-position).

n=6: Can take 1, leaving n=5 (P-position, losing for opponent). So current player can take 1, forcing opponent into P. So n=6 is an N-position (winning).

n=7: Take 1, leave n=6 (N-position). Or take 4, leave n=3 (N-position). So any move leaves opponent in N-position. So n=7 is a P-position.

Wait, but wait, can I confirm that? Let me think again. When at n=7:

If I take 1, opponent gets n=6, which is N-position, meaning opponent can win. But if I take 4, opponent gets n=3, which is N-position, so opponent can also win. So no matter what I do at n=7, the opponent can win. So n=7 is a P-position.

n=8: Take 1, leaving n=7 (P-position), so opponent is in a losing position. So current player can take 1, leaving P for opponent. So n=8 is N-position.

n=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (N-position). Take 4, leaving n=5 (P-position). So if I take 4, I leave
