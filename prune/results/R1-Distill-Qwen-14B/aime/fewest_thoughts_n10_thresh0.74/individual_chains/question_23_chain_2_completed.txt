Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin... So, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. 

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, is that correct? No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me check: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square (which is a special case of a rhombus), they are. Wait, no, actually, no— that's not right. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, wait, I think I'm confusing with a kite. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, no. Wait, let me correct myself: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at 90 degrees. Okay, that's a key point.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint of both diagonals, the coordinates of the vertices can be thought of in terms of vectors from the origin. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals bisect each other, the origin is their midpoint. So, the coordinates of A and C are such that if A is (p, q), then C is (-p, -q). Similarly, if B is (r, s), then D is (-r, -s).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are all equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But maybe a better approach is to use the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus together. Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, substituting each point into the hyperbola equation should hold. So, for point A (p, q), we have p²/20 - q²/24 = 1. Similarly, points B, C, D will satisfy the same equation.

But since C is (-p, -q), plugging into the hyperbola equation: (-p)²/20 - (-q)²/24 = p²/20 - q²/24 = 1, which is the same as point A. So, that's consistent. Similarly for B and D, they will give the same equation.

Now, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let's think about that. The diagonals are AC and BD. So, the slope of AC is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. Similarly, the slope of BD is (s - (-s))/(r - (-r)) = (2s)/(2r) = s/r. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. So, (q/p)*(s/r) = -1. So, (q*s)/(p*r) = -1. Let's note this as equation (1): q*s = -p*r.

Another important point is that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the midpoints are the same, which is the origin. But we already considered that by making A and C as (p, q) and (-p, -q), same with B and D.

Now, let's think about the sides of the rhombus. The sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Since it's a rhombus, all sides have equal length. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, etc.

Let's calculate AB². AB is from A (p, q) to B (r, s). So, AB² = (p - r)² + (q - s)^2.

Similarly, BC is from B (r, s) to C (-p, -q). So, BC² = (r + p)^2 + (s + q)^2.

Since AB² = BC², we have:

(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2 = (r + p)^2 + (s + q)^2.

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (p² - 2pr + r²) + (q² - 2qs + s²)
Right side: (r² + 2pr + p²) + (s² + 2qs + q²)

So, setting left equal to right:

p² - 2pr + r² + q² - 2qs + s² = r² + 2pr + p² + s² + 2qs + q²

Simplify both sides. The p², r², q², s² terms cancel out on both sides.

Left: -2pr -2qs = Right: +2pr + 2qs

Bring all terms to left:

-2pr -2qs -2pr -2qs = 0

Which simplifies to:

-4pr -4qs = 0

Divide both sides by -4:

pr + qs = 0

So, pr + qs = 0. Let's note this as equation (2).

We already have equation (1): q*s = -p*r.

So, equation (1): q*s = -p*r. And equation (2): p*r + q*s = 0. Wait, substituting equation (1) into equation (2):

From equation (1): q*s = -p*r => p*r = -q*s.

So, equation (2): p*r + q*s = (-q*s) + q*s = 0. Which is consistent. So, equations (1) and (2) are not independent. So, we only have one equation here: q*s = -p*r.

So, we need another condition.

Wait, perhaps we can find another relation. Let me think.

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, each satisfies x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, for point A: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

For point B: r²/20 - s²/24 = 1.

So, we have two hyperbola equations:

(3) p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

(4) r²/20 - s²/24 = 1

We also have equation (1): q*s = -p*r.

So, we have three equations: (1), (3), (4). We have four variables: p, q, r, s.

But since rhombus has two diagonals, and we have points A, B, C, D, perhaps it's better to consider the vectors or parametrize the points.

Alternatively, maybe we can parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola, and express the conditions for the rhombus.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, but in this case, the diagonals also intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint.

Moreover, in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy certain relations. The area can be expressed as (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, the sides can be expressed in terms of the diagonals.

Wait, perhaps since the diagonals are perpendicular, the rhombus can be considered as formed by two perpendicular vectors.

Let me think: Let’s denote vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Then, OA = (p, q), OB = (r, s). Then, since the diagonals intersect at O, and diagonals are AC and BD, which are 2*OA and 2*OB, respectively. Wait, no: the diagonals are AC and BD, so AC = OA - OC = OA - (-OA) = 2OA. Similarly, BD = OB - OD = OB - (-OB) = 2OB. So, the lengths of the diagonals are 2|OA| and 2|OB|. So, the lengths are 2*sqrt(p² + q²) and 2*sqrt(r² + s²).

Wait, but in a rhombus, the sides can be expressed in terms of the diagonals. Since diagonals are perpendicular, each side is equal to sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, each side is (1/2)*sqrt(d1² + d2²). So, the side length squared would be (d1² + d2²)/4.

But the side length squared can also be found by the distance between A and B. Which is (p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2.

So, equating these two expressions:

(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2 = (d1² + d2²)/4

But d1 = 2|OA| = 2*sqrt(p² + q²), so d1² = 4(p² + q²). Similarly, d2² = 4(r² + s²). So, d1² + d2² = 4(p² + q² + r² + s²). Thus,

(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2 = [4(p² + q² + r² + s²)] /4 = p² + q² + r² + s².

So,

(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2 = p² + q² + r² + s².

Expanding left side:

p² - 2pr + r² + q² - 2qs + s² = p² + q² + r² + s².

Subtract p² + q² + r² + s² from both sides:

-2pr -2qs = 0 => pr + qs = 0.

Which is the same as equation (2). So, that just gives us the same condition as before. So, nothing new here.

So, we have pr + qs = 0, and from equation (1): q*s = -p*r.

So, from equation (1): q*s = -p*r => pr = -q*s.

Substituting into equation (2): pr + qs = (-q*s) + q*s = 0. So, that's consistent.

So, with these conditions, perhaps we can express s in terms of p, q, r or something like that.

Wait, from equation (1): q*s = -p*r => s = (-p*r)/q.

Assuming q ≠ 0. Similarly, we can express r in terms of p, q, s.

But perhaps we can express s as (-p r)/q.

Now, let's plug this into equation (2): pr + qs = pr + q*(-p r)/q = pr - pr = 0. So, that's consistent.

So, perhaps we can express s in terms of r, p, q.

So, s = (-p r)/q.

Then, we can substitute s into the hyperbola equation for point B: r²/20 - s²/24 = 1.

Substituting s: r²/20 - [ (-p r / q )^2 ] /24 = 1.

Simplify:

r²/20 - [ (p² r²) / q² ] /24 = 1.

Factor out r²:

r² [ 1/20 - (p²)/(24 q²) ] = 1.

So,

r² = 1 / [ 1/20 - (p²)/(24 q²) ]

But from equation (3), point A's hyperbola equation: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Let me rearrange equation (3):

p²/20 = 1 + q²/24 => p² = 20(1 + q²/24) = 20 + (20 q²)/24 = 20 + (5 q²)/6.

So, p² = 20 + (5 q²)/6.

Now, plug this into the expression for r²:

r² = 1 / [ 1/20 - ( (20 + (5 q²)/6 ) ) / (24 q²) ) ]

Let me compute the denominator:

Denominator = 1/20 - [ (20 + (5 q²)/6 ) / (24 q²) ]

Let me compute the second term:

[ (20 + (5 q²)/6 ) / (24 q²) ] = [ (20*6 + 5 q² ) /6 ] / (24 q² ) = [ (120 + 5 q² ) /6 ] / (24 q² ) = (120 + 5 q² ) / (6 *24 q² ) = (120 +5 q² ) / (144 q² )

Simplify numerator:

120 +5 q² = 5 q² + 120 = 5(q² + 24 )

So,

Denominator = 1/20 - [5(q² +24 ) ] / (144 q² )

Now, let's write both terms with a common denominator:

1/20 = (72 q² ) / (1440 q² )

Wait, 1/20 = (72 q² ) / (1440 q² )

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute each term:

1/20 = (1 * 72 q² ) / (20 *72 q² ) = 72 q² / (1440 q² )

Wait, maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, let's compute the denominator as:

Denominator = (1/20) - (5(q² +24 )) / (144 q² )

Let me write both terms over a common denominator, which would be 1440 q².

So,

1/20 = (72 q² ) / (1440 q² )

and

5(q² +24 ) / (144 q² ) = (5(q² +24 ) * 10 ) / (1440 q² ) = (50(q² +24 )) / (1440 q² )

So,

Denominator = [72 q² -50(q² +24 ) ] / (1440 q² )

Compute numerator:

72 q² -50 q² -1200 = (72 -50) q² -1200 = 22 q² -1200

So,

Denominator = (22 q² -1200 ) / (1440 q² )

Therefore, r² = 1 / [ (22 q² -1200 ) / (1440 q² ) ] = (1440 q² ) / (22 q² -1200 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1440 q² = 1440 q²

Denominator: 22 q² -1200 = 2(11 q² -600 )

So,

r² = (1440 q² ) / [2(11 q² -600 ) ] = (720 q² ) / (11 q² -600 )

So, r² = (720 q² ) / (11 q² -600 )

But we need to ensure that denominator is positive, because r² must be positive.

So,

11 q² -600 >0 => q² > 600 /11 ≈54.545

Similarly, since the hyperbola equation is p²/20 - q²/24 =1, for real points, p² =20 + (5 q²)/6. So, p² is positive for any real q.

But for r² to be real, denominator must not be zero, so 11 q² -600 ≠0 => q² ≠600/11.

Also, since r² must be positive, denominator must be positive, so 11 q² -600 >0 => q² >600/11.

So, in our case, q² must be greater than 600/11 ≈54.545.

Now, let's think about BD². BD is one of the diagonals, which is 2|OB|. So, BD² = (2|OB|)^2 =4*(r² + s² )

But we can express s in terms of r, p, q.

Earlier, we found that s = (-p r ) / q.

So, s² = (p² r² ) / q².

So, BD² =4*(r² + (p² r² ) / q² ) =4 r² (1 + p² / q² )

But p² =20 +5 q² /6.

So, plug that in:

BD² =4 r² (1 + (20 +5 q² /6 ) / q² ) =4 r² [1 + (20 / q² ) + (5 q² /6 ) / q² ]

Simplify:

=4 r² [1 + 20 / q² +5/6 ]

=4 r² [ (1 +5/6 ) +20 / q² ]

=4 r² [ (11/6 ) +20 / q² ]

So,

BD² =4 r² (11/6 +20 / q² )

But we have an expression for r² in terms of q²: r² =720 q² / (11 q² -600 )

So, substituting this:

BD² =4*(720 q² / (11 q² -600 ))*(11/6 +20 / q² )

Simplify this expression step by step.

First, compute the constants:

4*720 =2880

So,

BD² =2880 q² / (11 q² -600 ) * (11/6 +20 / q² )

Now, let's compute the term in the second parenthesis:

11/6 +20/q² = (11 q² +120 )/(6 q² )

So,

BD² =2880 q² / (11 q² -600 ) * (11 q² +120 )/(6 q² )

Simplify:

The q² in the numerator cancels with the q² in the denominator.

So,

BD² =2880 / (11 q² -600 ) * (11 q² +120 ) /6

Simplify constants:

2880 /6 =480

So,

BD² =480*(11 q² +120 )/(11 q² -600 )

So, BD² =480*(11 q² +120 )/(11 q² -600 )

Let me denote t = q². Since q² >600/11, t>600/11≈54.545.

So, BD² becomes:

BD² =480*(11 t +120 )/(11 t -600 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator:11 t +120 =11 t +120

Denominator:11 t -600

So,

BD² =480*(11 t +120 )/(11 t -600 )

Let me write this as:

BD² =480*(11 t +120 )/(11 t -600 ) =480*[ (11 t -600 ) +720 ]/(11 t -600 )

Because 11 t +120 = (11 t -600 ) +720.

Wait: 11 t -600 +720 =11 t +120. Yes, correct.

So,

BD² =480*[1 +720/(11 t -600 ) ]

So,

BD² =480 + (480 *720 )/(11 t -600 )

Compute 480*720:

480 *720 = (48*72)*100 = (48*72)=3456, so 3456*100=345600.

So,

BD² =480 +345600/(11 t -600 )

So,

BD² =480 +345600/(11 t -600 )

Now, since t>600/11, denominator 11t -600>0.

So, as t increases beyond 600/11, the denominator increases, so 345600/(11t -600 ) decreases.

Therefore, BD² is a decreasing function of t.

So, to find the greatest lower bound of BD², we need to find the infimum of BD² as t approaches the minimal possible value, which is t approaching 600/11 from above.

Wait, but as t approaches 600/11 from above, 11t-600 approaches zero from above, so 345600/(11t -600 ) approaches infinity. So, BD² approaches infinity.

But we are to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the lower bound is when BD² is minimal.

Wait, no. Wait, BD² can be as large as possible as t approaches 600/11 from above, but we need the greatest number that's less than BD² for all rhombi. So, we need the infimum of BD².

Wait, but as t increases, BD² decreases. So, BD² has a minimum value when t is as large as possible. But t can be any value greater than 600/11.

Wait, but hyperbola extends to infinity, so t can be any real number greater than 600/11. So, t approaches infinity, so 11t -600 ~11t, so BD² ~480 +345600/(11t ) ~480 as t approaches infinity.

So, BD² approaches 480 from above as t increases.

Thus, the minimal value of BD² is 480, but since t can't be infinity, BD² can get arbitrarily close to 480 but can't be less than 480.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, when t approaches infinity, 11t -600 ~11t, so 345600/(11 t -600 ) ~ (345600 /11 ) /t approaches zero. So, BD² approaches 480.

But since t can't be infinity, the infimum of BD² is 480, but BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480 by taking t very large.

Similarly, as t approaches 600/11 from above, BD² approaches infinity. So, BD² can be as large as we want.

But the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that number would be the infimum of BD², because for all rhombi, BD² is greater than 480, but can get as close to 480 as desired. Therefore, the greatest lower bound is 480.

Wait, but let me verify this because I might have made a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, so BD² =480 +345600/(11t -600 )

So, when t approaches infinity, the term 345600/(11t -600 ) approaches zero, so BD² approaches 480.

And when t approaches 600/11 from above, the term 345600/(11t -600 ) approaches infinity, so BD² approaches infinity.

So, BD² can take any value from 480 up to infinity. So, the infimum is 480, and the supremum is infinity.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombuses is 480, because BD² can get as close to 480 as we like, but never less than 480. So, 480 is the lower bound.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, the infimum is 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, the answer is 480.

But let me cross-check with specific points.

Suppose we take t very large, say t approaching infinity. Then, q² is very large.

From equation (3): p² =20 +5 q² /6. So, p² is also very large.

From r² =720 q² / (11 q² -600 ) ≈720 q² /11 q²=720/11 as q² approaches infinity. So, r² approaches 720/11.

So, r approaches sqrt(720/11 )≈sqrt(65.4545 )≈8.09.

Then, s = (-p r ) / q.

But as q approaches infinity, p ~ sqrt(5 q² /6 ) ~ q * sqrt(5/6 ). So, p ~ (sqrt(5/6 )) q.

So, s = (-p r ) / q = (- (sqrt(5/6 ) q ) * r ) / q = - sqrt(5/6 ) r.

So, as q approaches infinity, s approaches - sqrt(5/6 ) r.

So, then, BD² is 4*(r² + s² )=4*(r² + (5/6 ) r² )=4*(11/6 r² )= (44/6 ) r²= (22/3 ) r².

But as q approaches infinity, r² approaches720/11, so BD² approaches (22/3 )*(720/11 )= (22*720 )/(3*11 )= (22/11 )*(720/3 )=2*240=480.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, BD² approaches 480 as t approaches infinity, so the infimum is 480. Hence, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but does BD² ever equal 480? Or is 480 just the limit?

Since t can't be infinity, BD² can't actually reach 480; it can only approach it. So, 480 is the infimum, but it's not attained. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombuses is 480.

Hence, the answer is 480.


The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all rhombuses \( ABCD \) on the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. 

1. **Properties of the Rhombus and Hyperbola**:
   - The diagonals of the rhombus bisect each other at the origin and are perpendicular.
   - Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the hyperbola, so their coordinates satisfy \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \).
   - If \( A = (p, q) \), then \( C = (-p, -q) \); similarly, \( B = (r, s) \) implies \( D = (-r, -s) \).

2. **Conditions for the Rhombus**:
   - The slopes of the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular, leading to \( \frac{q}{p} \cdot \frac{s}{r} = -1 \) or \( q \cdot s = -p \cdot r \).
   - The distances from the origin to \( A \) and \( B \) are related by the hyperbola equation: \( \frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{r^2}{20} - \frac{s^2}{24} = 1 \).

3. **Expression for \( BD^2 \)**:
   - Using the relationships between \( p, q, r, s \), it is derived that \( BD^2 = 480 + \frac{345600}{11t - 600} \), where \( t = q^2 \).
   - As \( t \to \infty \), \( BD^2 \) approaches 480. Since \( t \) cannot be infinity, \( BD^2 \) can get arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than it.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombuses is **480**.

\boxed{480}
