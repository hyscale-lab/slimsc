Alright, so I came across this probability problem involving a regular octagon, and I decided to give it a shot. Let's break it down and see if I can figure it out.

The problem says: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, let's parse this. We have a regular octagon, which means all sides and angles are equal. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance, independently. So, each vertex is an independent coin flip for red or blue.

Now, the key part is that we want to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. In other words, after some rotation, all the blue vertices align with the red ones from the original configuration.

I think the way to approach this is to consider the symmetries of the octagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational symmetry. The group of rotations is cyclic of order 8, meaning we can rotate it by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which are 8 possible rotations.

So, perhaps we can model this using group theory or combinatorics, considering all possible colorings and the rotations that map blue vertices to red ones.

Let me think: For a given coloring, we want to know if there exists a rotation such that when we apply that rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red.

Alternatively, if we fix the original coloring, we can think of shifting the octagon by some number of positions and check whether all the blue vertices in the shifted position correspond to red vertices in the original.

So, for each possible rotation (including the identity rotation, which does nothing), we can check if the shifted blue vertices all lie on red positions. If for any rotation this is true, then the coloring satisfies the condition.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings where at least one rotation (shift) results in all blue vertices being mapped to red positions, divided by the total number of possible colorings, which is 2^8 = 256.

The challenge is to count the number of such colorings. Let's denote this number as N. Then, the probability would be N / 256.

To compute N, it's helpful to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or perhaps Burnside's lemma, considering the group actions.

Wait, maybe Burnside's lemma is the way to go here. Burnside's lemma relates the number of orbits (distinct colorings under group actions) to the average number of fixed points of the group elements.

But wait, in this case, we're not directly counting orbits, but rather the number of colorings that are fixed under some rotation when considering a certain transformation. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps each rotation can be seen as a permutation of the vertices. For each rotation, we can define a permutation σ, and we want that after applying σ, the image of the blue vertices is a subset of the red vertices in the original coloring.

But wait, let me think again. So, for a given rotation σ, if we shift the octagon by σ, then the blue vertices in the shifted octagon must all lie on red vertices in the original. But in terms of the original coloring, that would mean that for each vertex v, if v is blue in the shifted octagon (which is σ applied to the original), then v must be red in the original. So, in other words, all the vertices that are blue in the coloring σ^{-1}(C), where C is the original coloring, must be red in C.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase: Suppose we have a coloring C. A rotation σ can be thought
