Okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It says: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let's try to unpack this and figure out how to approach it.

First, let me write down the expression clearly. I need to maximize the real part of the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

And z is a complex number with |z| = 4. So, z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. That's important because it tells me that z can be represented as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, since |z| = 4, I can write z = 4e^{iθ}, which might make things easier when dealing with exponents and inverses.

Wait, but working with exponentials might complicate things because of the addition of two terms. Maybe it's better to represent z as 4e^{iθ} and then proceed.

So, let's let z = 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since 1/z is the reciprocal of z, which for complex numbers is (1/|z|²) times the conjugate of z. Since |z| = 4, |z|² = 16, so 1/z = (1/16)*conj(z). But maybe using exponentials is simpler here.

So, substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/(4e^{iθ})).

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/(4e^{iθ})).

Simplify each term.

First term: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}. Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i). 4*75 is 300, and 4*117 is 468. So, the first term becomes (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-iθ}. 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So, the second term is (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression is:

(300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, to compute the real part of this expression. Since the real part is a linear operator, I can compute the real part of each term separately and then add them.

So, Re[(300 + 468i) e^{iθ}] + Re[(24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}].

Let's compute each Re separately.

First, let me recall that for a complex number a + ib multiplied by e^{iθ}, the real part is (a cosθ - b sinθ) if the complex number is a + ib. Wait, actually, no, wait. Let me think. The real part of (a + ib)e^{iθ} is (a cosθ - b sinθ). Because e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so (a + ib)(cosθ + i sinθ) = a cosθ + i a sinθ + i b cosθ - b sinθ. So, grouping real and imaginary parts: (a cosθ - b sinθ) + i(a sinθ + b cosθ). So, the real part is a cosθ - b sinθ.

Similarly, for (c + id)e^{-iθ}, since e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ, the real part would be c cosθ + d sinθ. Because (c + id)(cosθ - i sinθ) = c cosθ - i c sinθ + i d cosθ - i^2 d sinθ. Which is c cosθ + d sinθ + i(-c sinθ + d cosθ). So, real part is c cosθ + d sinθ.

So, for the first term, let me denote a = 300, b = 468.

So, Re[(300 + 468i)e^{iθ}] = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

For the second term, c = 24, d = 36.

Re[(24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}] = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So, the total real part is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Compute the coefficients:

300 + 24 = 324.

-468 + 36 = -432.

So, Real part = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, now, our task reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, where θ is a real number (since z can be any point on the circle, θ can vary from 0 to 2π).

So, this is an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, but in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

Now, I remember that the maximum of an expression like C cosθ + D sinθ is sqrt(C² + D²). So, the maximum value is sqrt(324² + (-432)²). Let me compute that.

Wait, but let me think if that's correct. So, for any expression a cosθ + b sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(a² + b²). Because you can write it as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²). So, the maximum value is R, and the minimum is -R.

So, in our case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is equivalent to 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ. So, a = 324, b = -432.

Thus, the maximum value is sqrt(324² + (-432)²). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared and 432 squared.

324 squared: 324 * 324.

Let me compute 300^2 = 90000.

24^2 = 576.

Then, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Wait, wait, let me compute 324 * 324 step by step.

Alternatively, 324^2 is 104,976. Let me verify:

324 * 300 = 97
