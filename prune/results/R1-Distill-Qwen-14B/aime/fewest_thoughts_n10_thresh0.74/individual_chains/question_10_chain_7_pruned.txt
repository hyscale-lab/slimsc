Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, Alice picks some set A, and then Bob is making all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024.

First, I should understand what the number 2024 represents here. Bob is listing all possible finite non-empty sets B where max(B) is in A. So, for each element m in A, Bob can create sets where m is the maximum element.

Wait, so for each m in A, the number of possible sets B with max(B) = m is equal to 2^{m-1}. Because for each number less than m, you can choose whether it's included or not. So, for each m, the number of subsets is 2^{m-1}.

But wait, no. Because B is a set, so the order doesn't matter, but it's a collection of elements. So for each m in A, the number of possible B's where max(B) is m is 2^{m-1}, because we can include any subset of the numbers from 1 to m-1, along with m.

But wait, no, because we're considering B as finite non-empty sets, so for each m, the number of possible B's with max(B) = m is 2^{m-1}. Because each element less than m can be either present or not, and m must be present.

So the total number of such sets B is the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1}. Because for each m, you have 2^{m-1} subsets where m is the maximum.

Therefore, the total number of sets B is equal to sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

So, the equation is sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

But A is a set of positive integers, so each m is unique. So, the problem reduces to finding a set A such that the sum of 2^{m-1} for each
