Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, no, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's right. So, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the midpoint of both AC and BD is the origin. So, points A and C are symmetric about the origin, and points B and D are symmetric about the origin as well.

So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D would be (-u, -v).

Now, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, each of these points satisfies the equation.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, which equals the distance from D to A.

Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, maybe I can use the properties of the diagonals.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then AC is perpendicular to BD, and they intersect at the origin.

So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. So, if AC is from point A to point C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y), but wait, no, AC is from A to C, but since AC is a diagonal, its midpoint is the origin, so AC is the vector from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors.

Alternatively, since A is (x, y) and C is (-x, -y), the vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, the diagonal BD connects B(u, v) to D(-u, -v), so the vector BD is (-2u, -2v).

Since diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.

So, AC · BD = (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 4xu + 4yv = 0.

Divide both sides by 4: xu + yv = 0.

So, the equation xu + yv = 0 must hold. That's one condition.

Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, A(x, y) satisfies x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and similarly, B(u, v) satisfies u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

So, now I have the following equations:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1
2. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1
3. xu + yv = 0

Additionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C.

Let me write the distance formulas.

Distance AB: sqrt[(x - u)² + (y - v)²]

Distance BC: sqrt[(u - (-x))² + (v - (-y))²] = sqrt[(u + x)² + (v + y)²]

Since AB = BC, their squares are equal:

(x - u)² + (y - v)² = (x + u)² + (y + v)²

Expanding both sides:

x² - 2xu + u² + y²
