Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right because the positive term is with x².

Then, there are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola that form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and I need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD². The answer will be the greatest number less than BD², which I think means the maximum possible value of BD² minus some epsilon, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me recall some properties. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, not necessarily at right angles. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect the angles, and they intersect at right angles. Hmm, I think that's correct. Let me confirm: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.

Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they bisect each other. So, if A is a point (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q). So, the rhombus is formed by these four points.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the adjacent points are such that the vectors from the origin to each vertex are related in a certain way. Let me think
