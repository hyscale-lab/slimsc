Okay, so I've got this problem here about a 2x3 grid. I need to figure out how many ways I can fill each cell with a digit (0 through 9) such that two conditions are met. First, when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Second, when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. Hmm, let me break this down.

Let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are 6 cells in total. I'll label them as follows:

Top row: A B C  
Bottom row: D E F

So, reading left to right, the top row is ABC, which is a three-digit number, right? Similarly, the bottom row is DEF, another three-digit number. Their sum should be 999. That gives me the equation:

ABC + DEF = 999.

Then, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. Wait, no, wait. Wait, top to bottom, each column has two digits, but the grid is 2x3. So, each column has two cells. So, the numbers formed are AD, BE, and CF. Each of these is a two-digit number. Their sum is 99. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, let me check that. The grid has three columns, each with two digits, so each column can be read top to bottom as a two-digit number. So, the first column is A and D, making AD; the second column is B and E, making BE; third column is C and F, making CF. So, the sum is AD + BE + CF = 99.

So, to recap, the conditions are:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

I need to find the number of possible digit assignments (A,B,C,D,E,F) that satisfy both conditions.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe it's better to express these numbers in terms of their digits. Let's break down ABC and DEF.

ABC is a three-digit number, so ABC = 100*A + 10*B + C.

Similarly, DEF = 100*D + 10*E + F.

So, the first condition is:

(100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999.

Let me simplify that. 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

So, 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Now, 999 is 9*111, which is 9*100 + 9*10 + 9*1, so 999 = 900 + 90 + 9. So, comparing the coefficients:

100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 900 + 90 + 9.

Which implies:

A + D = 9,

B + E = 9,

C + F = 9.

Wait, because 100*(A+D) must be 900, so (A+D)=9.

Similarly, 10*(B+E) must be 90, so (B+E)=9.

And (C + F) must be 9.
