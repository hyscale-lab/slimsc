Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that any complex number z with a modulus of 4 can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might be useful because exponentials might make it easier to handle both z and 1/z.

Wait, because if |z| = 4, then 1/z would have a modulus of 1/4, right? Because |1/z| = 1/|z| = 1/4. So 1/z can be written as (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since z is 4e^{iθ} and 1/z is the conjugate over |z| squared, which would be e^{-iθ}/16. Wait, hold on: let me check that.

Actually, z = 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because when you take the reciprocal of a complex number in polar form, you invert the modulus and negate the argument. So yeah, that makes sense.

So maybe I can express both terms in the expression in terms of e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}. Let me try that.

Let me write the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z

Substituting z = 4e^{iθ} and 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}, we get:

(75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}

Simplify each term:

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i) e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}

So the entire expression becomes:

(300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}

Hmm. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. Then, the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

The real part of this would be Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}) = Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}).

I think I can compute each real part separately. Let me recall that Re(C e^{iθ}) = |C| cos(θ + φ), where φ is the argument of C. Wait, no, actually, if C = c + di, then Re(C e^{iθ}) = c cosθ - d sinθ. Wait, wait, let me double-check.

Let me write C e^{iθ} = (c + di)(cosθ + i sinθ) = c cosθ - d sinθ + i(c sinθ + d cosθ). So yes, the real part is c cosθ - d sinθ.

So applying that to both terms:

For A = 300 + 468i, Re(A e^{iθ}) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

For B = 24 + 36i, Re(B e^{-iθ}) = 24 cos(-θ) - 36 sin(-θ) = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ, because cos(-θ) = cosθ and sin(-θ) = -sinθ.

So adding them together, the real part of the entire expression is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So now, I need to maximize 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ over θ.

Hmm, that looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine. I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²), but I might have the sign wrong. Alternatively, it can be R sin(θ + φ) or something similar. Let me recall.

Actually, the general form is a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²) and φ = arctan(b/a) or something like that. Let me verify.

Wait, let me think. Let me write 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ as R cos(θ + φ). So, expanding R cos(θ + φ) = R cosθ cosφ - R sinθ sinφ.

Comparing with the original expression, 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, we have:

R cosφ = 324

R sinφ = 432

Wait, because the coefficient of cosθ is positive and sinθ is negative, so in the expansion, R cosφ should match the coefficient of cosθ, which is 324, and R sinφ should match the coefficient of sinθ, which is -432. Wait, no, in the expression above, it's -432 sinθ, so the expansion is R cosθ cosφ - R sinθ sinφ, which would imply that the coefficients are R cosφ for cosθ and -R sinφ for sinθ. So:

R cosφ = 324

-R sinφ = -432 → R sinφ = 432

So yes, R sinφ =432.

So R^2 = (324)^2 + (432)^2.

Let me compute R.

First, compute 324^2:

324 * 324: 300^2 =90,000, 24^2=576, and cross terms 2*300*24=14,400.

So (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 =90,000 +14,400 +576= 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and cross terms 2*400*32=25,600.

So (400 +32)^2= 160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 186,624.

So R^2=104,976 + 186,624=291,600.

Thus, R = sqrt(291,600). Let's compute that.

Well, 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So (500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600. Yes, so R=540.

So R=540.

Now, the maximum value of R cos(θ + φ) is R, since the maximum of cos is 1. So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me check. We have the expression as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ = 540 cos(θ + φ). The maximum of this is 540, since the maximum of cosine is 1.

Wait, but let me make sure about the sign. Because I had:

324 cosθ -432 sinθ = 540 cos(θ + φ)

So that would mean that the maximum is 540.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ = R cos(θ + φ) with R=540, so the maximum is R=540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating R.

R^2 = 324^2 + 432^2.

324 is 18*18=324? Wait, 18^2=324, yes. 432 is 24*18.

Wait, so 324 = 18^2, 432 = 24 * 18.

So R^2 = (18^2)^2 + (24 * 18)^2 = 18^4 + (24^2 * 18^2) = 18^2 (18^2 + 24^2).

Compute 18^2=324, 24^2=576.

So R^2= 324*(324 +576)=324*(900)=291,600, which is correct, so R=540.

Yes, that seems right.

So the maximum is 540.

Wait, but let me think again. The expression we have is Re[(75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z], which we transformed into 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, and that simplifies to 540 cos(θ + φ), so the maximum value is 540.

So the largest possible real part is 540.

But wait, let me make sure that this is correct because the problem seems a bit straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I should consider using calculus or another method to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers or optimization, but I think the approach I took is correct because I transformed z into polar form, used the properties of complex conjugates, and then used trigonometric identities to combine the terms into a single cosine function, which allows us to find the maximum.

So yes, I think the maximum real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), so \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i)\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplifying each term:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

The real part of this expression is:

\[
\text{Re}\left[(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}\right] + \text{Re}\left[(24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\right]
\]

Using the property \(\text{Re}(C e^{i\theta}) = c \cos\theta - d \sin\theta\) for \(C = c + di\), we compute:

\[
(300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta) + (24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta)
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta
\]

This can be rewritten as \(R \cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540\). The maximum value of \(\cos(\theta + \phi)\) is 1, so the largest possible real part is:

\[
\boxed{540}
\]
