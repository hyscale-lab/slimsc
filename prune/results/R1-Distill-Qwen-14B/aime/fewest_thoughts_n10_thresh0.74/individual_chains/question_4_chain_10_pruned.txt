Okay, so I need to figure out this game problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with two possible moves each turn: remove 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first. So, if we can model the winning and losing positions, that might help.

I remember in combinatorial game theory, a position is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position is one where there's at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

So, let's try to build up a list of winning (W) and losing (L) positions starting from small n.

Base cases:
- n=0: Well, the game is over. But since the last token was taken, maybe this is a losing position because you can't move. Wait, but in the problem statement, the last token wins, so n=0 would mean the previous player has already won. So, maybe n=0 is considered a losing position for the current player.
- n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, W.
- n=4: The current player can take 4 and win. So, W.

Wait, but let me think about n=2. If a player is faced with n=2, they can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Or they can't take 4 because there aren't enough. So, the opponent can win from n=1. So, n=2 would be a losing position? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, let's make a table for n from 0 upwards and mark whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n | outcome
0 | L (no moves can be made, so current player loses)
1 | W (take 1)
2 | ?
3 | ?
4 | W (take 4)
5 | ?
6 | ?
7 | ?
8 | ?

Let's compute step by step.

n=0: L
n=1: W (take 1)
n=2: Can take 1, leaving n=
