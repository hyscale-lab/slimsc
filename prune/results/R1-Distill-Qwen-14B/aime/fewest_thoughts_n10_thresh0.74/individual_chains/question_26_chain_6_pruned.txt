Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, and we need to find AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, compute m + n.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, the lengths of the tangents from a common external point are equal. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB = DC. That might come in handy later.

First, perhaps I should find some key elements of triangle ABC. The sides are AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Let me see if it's a right-angled triangle or something. Let me check using the Pythagorean theorem: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which isn't 10²=100, so it's not right-angled. Maybe it's acute or obtuse.

Wait, maybe I should compute the circumradius of triangle ABC because the circle ω is the circumcircle. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So, let's compute the area first. Using Heron's formula: the semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Then, area Δ = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504]. Simplify that: sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, 504 factors into 16*31.5? Wait no, 504 = 16*31.5 is incorrect because 16*31.5=504, yes, but 31.5 isn't an integer. Alternatively, 504= 16 * 31.5 is the same as 16 * (63/2) = (16*63)/2. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*63/2)=4*sqrt(63/2)=4*(3*sqrt(14)/sqrt(2))=4*(3*sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2))=4*3*sqrt(7)=12*sqrt(7). Wait, no, that can't be right because 63/2 is 31.5. Let me redo that.

Wait, 504 factors into 16 * 31.5 is correct, but perhaps a better way is 504 = 4 * 126 = 4 * 9 * 14 = 4 * 9 * 2 *7= 4*2*9*7. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(4*2*9*7)=sqrt(4)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(2*7)=2*3*sqrt(14)=6*sqrt(14). Oh, right! So Δ = 6*sqrt(14).

So the area is 6√14. Then, the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4Δ) = (5*9*10)/(4*6*sqrt(14)) = (450)/(24*sqrt(14)) = (75)/(4*sqrt(14)). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(14): R = (75*sqrt(14))/(4*14) = (75*sqrt(14))/56. So R = 75√14 / 56.

But I'm not sure if I need R yet. Maybe. Let me think about the problem again.

We have point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, D is the exsymmedian point? Or maybe not. Alternatively, point D is the ex-pole with respect to BC. Hmm, perhaps I can use properties of harmonic division or something.

Wait, let me recall that the polar of D with respect to ω is BC because D lies on the
