Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and then stops at a coffee shop. Depending on her walking speed, the total time she takes, including the time she spends at the coffee shop, changes. I need to find out how much time she takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, so let me break it down. First, when she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her walk takes 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, her walking time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes at the coffee shop. 

Wait, so both times include the coffee shop time. That means the total time is the time she spends walking plus the t minutes in the coffee shop. So, if I can find out how long she walks at each speed, I can set up equations to solve for s and t.

Let me denote the walking time as T1 when her speed is s, and T2 when her speed is s + 2. 

So, for the first scenario:
- Walking speed = s km/h
- Total time (walking + coffee) = 4 hours
But wait, 4 hours includes t minutes. Hmm, but 4 hours is in hours, and t is in minutes, so I need to convert them to the same units to set up the equations correctly.

Let me convert t into hours. Since t minutes is t/60 hours. So, the total time is 4 hours, which is the time she spends walking plus t/60 hours. 

So, the time she spends walking when her speed is s is (4 - t/60) hours. Similarly, the time she spends walking when her speed is s + 2 is (2 hours 24 minutes - t/60 hours). 

Wait, 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 hours. Let me calculate that: 24/60 is 0.4 hours, so 2.4 hours. So, the walking time is (2.4 - t/60) hours.

But let me write it more precisely.

In the first case:
Distance = speed × time
9 km = s × (4 - t/60) hours.

In the second case:
9 km = (s + 2) × (2.4 - t/60) hours.

So, I have two equations:

1) 9 = s * (4 - t/60)
2) 9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)

So, these are two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve this system of equations.

Let me write them again for clarity:

Equation 1: 9 = s*(4 - t/60)
Equation 2: 9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60)

Let me express both equations in terms of s and t.

From Equation 1:
s*(4 - t/60) = 9
=> s = 9 / (4 - t/60)   ...(1a)

From Equation 2:
(s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60) = 9
=> (s + 2) = 9 / (2.4 - t/60)   ...(2a)

Now, since Equation (1a) gives s in terms of t, I can substitute that into Equation (2a).

So, substituting s from (1a) into (2a):

(9 / (4 - t/60) + 2) = 9 / (2.4 - t/60)

Hmm, now I have an equation with just t. Let me simplify this step by step.

Let me denote t/60 as x for simplicity.

Let x = t/60 hours. So, x is in hours, which is t minutes.

So, substituting x into the equation:

(9 / (4 - x) + 2) = 9 / (2.4 - x)

Now, let's compute this.

Left side: (9/(4 - x)) + 2 = [9 + 2*(4 - x)] / (4 - x) = [9 + 8 - 2x]/(4 - x) = (17 - 2x)/(4 - x)

Right side: 9/(2.4 - x)

So, equation becomes:

(17 - 2x)/(4 - x) = 9/(2.4 - x)

Let me cross-multiply to eliminate denominators:

(17 - 2x)*(2.4 - x) = 9*(4 - x)

Let me expand both sides.

First, left side:

Multiply (17 - 2x) and (2.4 - x):

= 17*2.4 - 17x - 2x*2.4 + 2x^2

Calculate 17*2.4: 17*2=34, 17*0.4=6.8, so total 34 +6.8=40.8

-17x - 2x*2.4: 

-17x -4.8x = -21.8x

So, left side becomes: 40.8 -21.8x +2x^2

Right side: 9*(4 - x) = 36 -9x

So, equation is:

40.8 -21.8x + 2x^2 = 36 -9x

Bring all terms to left side:

40.8 -21.8x +2x^2 -36 +9x = 0

Simplify:

(40.8 -36) + (-21.8x +9x) +2x^2 =0

4.8 -12.8x +2x^2=0

Let me rearrange:

2x^2 -12.8x +4.8 =0

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in x. Let me write it as:

2x² -12.8x +4.8 =0

To make it simpler, maybe divide all terms by 2:

x² -6.4x +2.4=0

Now, quadratic equation: x² -6.4x +2.4=0

I can solve this using quadratic formula.

x = [6.4 ± sqrt(6.4² -4*1*2.4)] /2

Calculate discriminant D:

D = (6.4)^2 -4*1*2.4

6.4^2: 6*6=36, 0.4^2=0.16, and cross terms 2*6*0.4=4.8; so (6.
