Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I can only use some of them. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Plus, once I place some chips following these rules, adding any more should violate them. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, the grid is 5x5, so 25 cells. Each cell can have a chip or not, but with the color constraints. So for each row, all the chips in that row must be the same color. That means for each row, I can choose either all white, all black, or no chips. Similarly, for each column, all chips must be the same color. Wait, but if I choose a color for a row, does that affect the columns? Because if a column has multiple rows with chips, they all have to be the same color.

So, perhaps I need to think about this in terms of assigning colors to rows and columns in a consistent way. Let me consider that each row can be either white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be white, black, or empty. But these assignments have to align such that if a cell is in a white row and a black column, it can't have a chip because it can't be both white and black. So, the color assignments for rows and columns must be compatible.

Wait, but each cell can only have at most one chip, but if I assign a color to a row and a column, then the cell's color is determined by both. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of each cell's color as the intersection of the row's color and the column's color. But no, the chips in a row must all be the same color, and same for the columns. So, for a cell to have a chip, it must be that both its row and column are assigned that color.

Wait, perhaps the grid's cells that have chips must be such that all are the same color if they are in the same row or column. So, for example, if I decide that row 1 is white, then all chips in row 1 must be white, and if column 1 is black, then all chips in column
