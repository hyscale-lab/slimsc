Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make it so that Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such problems, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, I think we can model the game by determining for each n whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position. Since Alice goes first, if the starting position is a losing position, then Bob can force a win. Otherwise, Alice can.

Let me try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation for these positions.

Base cases:
- If n = 0, the game is over. So, the player who just moved wins. But since the last token was taken, the player who took the last token is the winner. Wait, so n=0 is a terminal position. But in our problem, n starts at 1.

Wait, perhaps I should consider n=0 as the position after the last move, meaning the game is over. So for n=1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a W position.

Similarly, for n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent. But then the opponent can take the last one. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Let's correct this. Each player can take 1 or 4 tokens. So for n=1, the current player takes 1 and wins. So n=1 is a W.

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1. Then the opponent takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, can't take 4 because n=2 <4. So if current player leaves 1, opponent wins. So n=2 is a losing position? Wait, no. Wait, if the current player is in n=2, and can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then take that and win. So the current player (at n=2) cannot force a win, so n=2 is a losing position (L).

Similarly, n=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position. So the opponent is forced into L, meaning n=3 is a W.

n=4: current player can take 4 and win. So n=4 is W.

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is a W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is also a W for the opponent. So if all possible moves lead to opponent's W, then n=5 is L.

Wait, so n=5 is L. So the current player at n=5 cannot force a win, so it's a losing position.

n=6: current player can take 1, leaving 5 (which is L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win
