Okay, so I've got this complex number problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be written in polar form as \( z = re^{i\theta} \), where \( r \) is the modulus (which is 4 in this case) and \( \theta \) is the argument. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). That might make things easier because dealing with exponents can sometimes simplify multiplication and division.

So, plugging \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's see what we get. The expression is \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]. Substituting \( z \) gives:

\[
(75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplify each term separately. Let's compute the first term first:

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \). Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i):

4*75 = 300, and 4*117 = 468. So this becomes 300 + 468i, multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \).

Now, the second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \). Let's compute the numerator first: 96 + 144i divided by 4 is 24 + 36i. So the second term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \) because dividing by \( e^{i\theta} \) is the same as multiplying by \( e^{-i\theta} \).

So now the entire expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

I need to find the real part of this expression. To do that, I can express each term using Euler's formula: \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me denote \( A = 300 + 468i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \). So the expression is \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \).

Expanding this:

\( A(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + B(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Which is:

\( (A + B)\cos\theta + i(A - B)\sin\theta \)

But since we're only interested in the real part, it's:

\( \text{Re}(A + B)\cos\theta - \text{Im}(A - B)\sin\theta \)

Wait, actually, let me make sure. Let me write it out properly.

Expanding \( A e^{i\theta} \):

= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)

But \( i^2 = -1 \), so this becomes:

= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Similarly, \( B e^{-i\theta} \):

= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \):

= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Now, adding both terms together:

Real parts: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \)

But since we only care about the real part, let's combine the real parts:

\( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

So the real part of the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Our goal is to find the maximum value of this expression as \( \theta \) varies.

Hmm, so this is a function of \( \theta \): \( f(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). To find its maximum, I can think of this as a single sinusoidal function. The maximum value of \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). But wait, in this case, the signs are important. Let me double-check.

Actually, \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be written as \( R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \) (or something like that). So the maximum value is indeed \( R \).

But in our case, it's \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So the coefficients are 324 and -432. Let me compute R.

\( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \)

Compute 324 squared: 324*324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90000, 24^2 is 576, and 2*300*24=14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90000 +14400 +576 = 105,  let me compute 90000 +14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2 is (400 +32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000 + 25600 is 185600, plus 1024 is 186,624. But since it's (-432)^2, it's same as 432^2, so 186,624.

So R^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So R is sqrt(291,600). Let's compute that. 500^2 is 250,000. 540^2 is 291,600. Because 54^2 is 2916, so 540^2 is 291,600. So R = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but I should make sure that the maximum is indeed achievable. Since the expression is sinusoidal, yes, it will reach this maximum when \( \theta \) is such that the angle aligns correctly.

So, the largest possible real part is 540.


The given expression is \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), where \( |z| = 4 \). Expressing \( z \) in polar form as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), we rewrite the expression as:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding using Euler's formula and combining real parts, we find the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). The maximum value of this expression is the amplitude \( \sqrt{32
