Okay, so I have this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, basically, I need to find the infimum of BD², which is the lower bound for BD², and then find the greatest number less than that.

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Hmm, wait no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Let me confirm that. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.

Given that, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (a, b), then point D must be (-a, -b).

So, the four points are A(x, y), B(a, b), C(-x, -y), D(-a, -b).

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, each of these points must satisfy this equation. So, for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and similarly for point B: a²/20 - b²/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal in length. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, which equals the distance between D and A.

But maybe there's a better way to approach this using the properties of the diagonals. Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, the vectors of the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if I consider vectors AC and BD, their dot product should be zero.

But wait, in a rhombus, it's the diagonals that are perpendicular, right? So, vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. Vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2a, -2b). Alternatively, the vectors could be considered as AC = (2x, 2y) if considering from C to A, but regardless, the direction might not matter for the dot product.

Wait, no. The vectors AC and BD are AC = C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD = D - B = (-a -a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2a, -2b), respectively.

For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So:

(-2x)(-2a) + (-2y)(-2b) = 0
4xa + 4yb = 0
Divide both sides by 4:
xa + yb = 0

So, equation (1): xa + yb = 0.

Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we have:

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1  ...(2)
a²/20 - b²/24 = 1  ...(3)

We need to relate these equations. Since we have four variables (x, y, a, b), but we have three equations so far. Maybe we can find more relations based on the rhombus properties.

In a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C. Let's write expressions for these distances.

Distance AB: sqrt[(a - x)² + (b - y)²]
Distance BC: sqrt[(-x - a)² + (-y - b)²]

Since AB = BC, their squares are equal:

(a - x)² + (b - y)² = (-x - a)² + (-y - b)²

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: (a - x)² + (b - y)² = (a² - 2ax + x²) + (b² - 2by + y²)
Right side: (-x - a)² + (-y - b)² = (x + a)² + (y + b)² = (x² + 2ax + a²) + (y² + 2by + b²)

Set left = right:

a² - 2ax + x² + b² - 2by + y² = x² + 2ax + a² + y² + 2by + b²

Simplify both sides by subtracting common terms:

Left: a² - 2ax + x² + b² - 2by + y²
Right: a² + 2ax + x² + b² + 2by + y²

Subtract right from left:

(a² - 2ax + x² + b² - 2by + y²) - (a² + 2ax + x² + b² + 2by + y²) = 0
-4ax -4by = 0
Which simplifies to:
-4(ax + by) = 0
Divide both sides by -4:
ax + by = 0

Wait, that's the same as equation (1). So, this doesn't give us any new information. Hmm, interesting. So, this condition is redundant because it's the same as the perpendicularity condition.

So, perhaps I need another condition. Let's think about the properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals bisect each other, the origin is the midpoint, which we've already considered. Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal unless it's a square. So, the lengths of the diagonals can vary.

But since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, perhaps we can express the sides in terms of the diagonals.

In a rhombus, each side can be expressed as half the magnitude of the diagonals. Wait, no. Wait, the sides can be found using the Pythagorean theorem because the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, each side is equal to sqrt[(d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2], where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the lengths of the diagonals are 2*sqrt(x² + y²) and 2*sqrt(a² + b²). Wait, no, the length of AC is |AC| = sqrt[( -2x)^2 + (-2y)^2] = sqrt(4x² + 4y²) = 2*sqrt(x² + y²). Similarly, BD's length is 2*sqrt(a² + b²).

So, the side length of the rhombus is sqrt[( (sqrt(x² + y²) )^2 + (sqrt(a² + b²) )^2 ) ].

Wait, let me clarify. Since the diagonals are 2*sqrt(x² + y²) and 2*sqrt(a² + b²), each half-diagonal is sqrt(x² + y²) and sqrt(a² + b²). Then, the side length is sqrt[ (sqrt(x² + y²))² + (sqrt(a² + b²))² ] = sqrt( x² + y² + a² + b² ).

So, the side length squared is x² + y² + a² + b².

But since all sides are equal, maybe I can use this in some way, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the points.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to represent points A and B in terms of some parameters, considering the hyperbola.

Since the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. So, points on the hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. So, point A can be represented as (sqrt(20) sec θ, sqrt(24) tan θ), and point B can be represented as (sqrt(20) sec φ, sqrt(24) tan φ). But I'm not sure if this is the easiest way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider points as (x, y) and (-x, -y), but that's the same as points A and C.

Wait, no, points A and C are (x, y) and (-x, -y), and points B and D are (a, b) and (-a, -b). So, the four points are A(x, y), B(a, b), C(-x, -y), D(-a, -b).

We know that the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, so equation (1) is xa + yb = 0.

We also know that points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so equations (2) and (3) hold.

So, our goal is to find BD², which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.

The length of BD is the distance between points B and D, which is sqrt[ (-a - a)^2 + (-b - b)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2a)^2 + (-2b)^2 ] = sqrt[4a² + 4b²] = 2*sqrt(a² + b²). Therefore, BD² = 4(a² + b²).

So, our target is to find the infimum of BD², which is 4(a² + b²), subject to the constraints.

So, our constraints are:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 (Equation 2)
2. a²/20 - b²/24 = 1 (Equation 3)
3. xa + yb = 0 (Equation 1)

We need to minimize BD² = 4(a² + b²), given these constraints.

So, we can think of this as an optimization problem. We need to minimize 4(a² + b²) subject to the above three constraints.

Since 4 is a constant factor, we can equivalently minimize a² + b².

So, let me rephrase the problem: minimize a² + b², given that:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1,
2. a²/20 - b²/24 = 1,
3. xa + yb = 0.

I need to express a² + b² in terms that can be minimized using these constraints. Maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers, but since it's a bit involved, perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, maybe we can express x and y in terms of a and b, or vice versa, using the condition xa + yb =
