Alright, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, and D on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal in length and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, I think the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, scratch that. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but they do bisect each other. Wait, no, that's a kite. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me recall. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal. Its diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So, points A, B, C,
