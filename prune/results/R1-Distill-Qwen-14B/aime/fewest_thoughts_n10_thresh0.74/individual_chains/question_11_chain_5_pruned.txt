Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It says: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, alright. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that \( z \) is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That's because the magnitude is 4, so in polar form, it's \( r = 4 \). So, \( z = 4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \). That might come in handy later.

Now, the expression I need to maximize is the real part of \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Let me denote this expression as \( E \), so:

\( E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \)

I need to find the maximum real part of \( E \). So, I should probably express \( E \) in terms of \( \theta \) and then find its real part, then maximize that.

First, let me substitute \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into \( E \).

So, substituting:

\( E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \)

Let me compute each part separately.

Compute the first term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \):

Multiply 75 and 117 by 4:

75 * 4 = 300

117 * 4 = 468

So, the first term becomes \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Now, the second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \).

Divide 96 and 144 by 4:

96 / 4 = 24

144 / 4 = 36

So, the second term becomes \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \). Because \( 1/e^{i\theta} = e^{-i\theta} \).

So now, \( E = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, I need to compute this and find its real part. Let me expand each term using Euler's formula.

First, \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Multiplying out:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta

Since \( i^2 = -1 \):

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta

Imaginary part: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i

Similarly, for the second term \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \):

= (24 + 36i)(\cos(-\theta) + i\sin(-\theta)) 

Since \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \)

So,

= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \):

= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta

Imaginary part: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i

Now, adding the two expanded terms together:

First term real: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta

Second term real: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta

Total real part: (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta

Which is 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

Similarly, for the imaginary parts:

First term imag: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i

Second term imag: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i

Total imaginary part: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta -24\sin\theta +36\cos\theta)i

= (276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i

But since we are only interested in the real part of E, we can ignore the imaginary part.

So, the real part of E is:

\( \text{Re}(E) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \( \theta \).

So, the problem reduces to maximizing \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

I remember that expressions of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Alternatively, it's sometimes written as \( R\sin(\theta + \phi) \), depending on convention.

But in any case, the maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), because the cosine or sine functions have a maximum of 1.

Wait, actually, let me get that right. The maximum value is indeed the amplitude \( R \), because \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = R \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). So, indeed, the maximum value is \( R \).

So, let me compute \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Wait, but wait a second. The expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, a is 324 and b is -432.

So, R
