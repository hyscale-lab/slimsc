Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, going from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. And these paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, I know that in a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite without changing direction would just be a straight line, but obviously, that's not the case here. So, in an 8x8 grid, moving from (0,0) to (8,8), you have to make 8 moves right and 8 moves up, but in some order.

But wait, the problem says the path changes direction exactly four times. So, what does that mean exactly? Each time you switch from moving right to up or up to right, that's a change in direction. So, if I think about a path, it's a series of horizontal and vertical segments. Each segment is either all right or all up.

So for example, a path that goes right 3, up 2, right 5, up 3, right 0, up 0... wait, no, wait. Actually, in an 8x8 grid, you need to make 8 right moves and 8 up moves in some order. So, any path is a sequence of right and up moves adding up to 8 each. The number of direction changes is the number of times you switch from right to up or up to right.

So, if I have a path, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, if you have R runs of right and U runs of up, then the total number of direction changes is (R + U - 1). Wait, no, actually, each change in direction is between runs. So, if you have R runs of right and U runs of up, then the number of direction changes is (R + U - 1), because each run after the first one requires a direction change.

Wait, let's think: starting with right, then if you switch to up, that's one change. Then, if you switch back to right, that's another, and so on.

So, the number of direction changes is equal to (number of runs) - 1. Because the first run doesn't require a change; each subsequent run adds a change.

So, if a path has exactly four direction changes, that means the number of runs is five. Because 5 runs would require 4 changes.

Now, how many runs of right and up do we have? Let's denote R as the number of right runs and U as the number of up runs. Then, R + U = 5, since the total number of runs is five.

Each right run is a consecutive sequence of right moves, and each up run is a consecutive sequence of up moves. The sum of all right runs is 8 because you have to move right 8 units. Similarly, the sum of up runs is 8.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of compositions of 8 into R parts for right runs and into U parts for up runs, where R + U = 5. And since the path must start either with right or up, we have two cases.

Wait, actually, the starting direction can be either right or up, so we need to consider both possibilities.

So, let's model this. Let me denote:

Let R be the number of right runs, U be the number of up runs.

We have R + U = 5.

But the path can start with right or up, so for each possible R and U, we need to consider both cases.

Wait, but R and U are positive integers, right? Because you can't have zero runs of a direction if you have to reach the end.

Wait, no, actually, if you start with right, then R can be from 1 to 5, but U would be from 0 to
