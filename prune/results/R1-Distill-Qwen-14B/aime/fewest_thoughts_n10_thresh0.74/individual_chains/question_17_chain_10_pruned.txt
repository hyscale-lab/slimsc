Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, let's think about rectangular boxes. They have length, width, and height, right? Let me denote them as x, y, z. So, the surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. And the volume is xyz = 23. Got that.

Now, the smallest sphere that can contain the box would have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is calculated using the formula sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Since the radius is half of that, r = d/2. Therefore, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, to find r², I need to find the minimum value of (x² + y² + z²)/4 given the constraints on surface area and volume. That means I need to find the minimum of x² + y² + z² with the given conditions.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27
2. xyz = 23

And I need to minimize x² + y² + z².

Hmm, I remember that for a given surface area and volume, the minimal space diagonal occurs when the box is a cube? Wait, is that always true? I'm not entirely sure, but maybe under certain constraints. Wait, no, in this case, the surface area and volume might not allow it to be a cube. Let me check.

If it were a cube, then all sides would be equal: x = y = z. Then, surface area would be 6x² = 54 ⇒ x² = 9 ⇒ x = 3. Then volume would be x³ = 27. But the volume here is 23, which is less than 27. So, it's not a cube. Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² might be achieved at some other proportions.

So, I can't assume it's a cube. I'll have to find x, y, z such that they satisfy the surface area and volume, and then find x² + y² + z².

How do I approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers for constrained optimization. That's a method where you can find the extrema of a function subject to constraints.

So, I need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z²
Subject to the constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27
h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

But wait, Lagrange multipliers with two constraints? Hmm, that might get complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe
