Alright, so I've got this problem here involving some coordinate geometry. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the points O, A, and B are defined. O is at (0,0), the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). Then B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere along the y-axis, a bit more than halfway since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. 

The problem talks about a family of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So these are segments that start on the x-axis and go to the y-axis, each exactly 1 unit long. For example, if P is at (a, 0), then Q would be at (0, b) such that the distance between (a,0) and (0,b) is 1. So, sqrt(a² + b²) = 1, which means a² + b² = 1. That's the equation of a unit circle, so all such points P and Q lie on the unit circle in the first quadrant.

So the family F consists of all such segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ is of unit length. 

Now, the problem mentions a point C on segment AB, which is distinct from A and B. This point C is the unique point on AB that isn't on any other segment from the family F except for AB itself. So, AB is part of this family F because when P is at A (1/2, 0) and Q is at B (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB is of unit length (since the distance between A and B is 1). Let me check that: the distance between A and B would be sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1, yes, so AB is indeed in F.

So, the point C is on AB but not on any other segment from F. So, for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB), C isn't on PQ. We need to find OC², where OC is the distance from the origin to point C.

To find OC², I need to find the coordinates of point C first. So, let's find the equation of line AB and then figure out where point C is located on it.

First, let's write the equation of line AB. A is at (1/2, 0) and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). 

So, the slope-intercept form of the line AB is y = mx + b. Since it passes through B (0, sqrt(3)/2), the y-intercept b is sqrt(3)/2. So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2 (since A is at x = 1/2 and B is at x=0).

Now, we need to find point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment PQ from F except for AB. 

So, for point C to not lie on any other PQ in F, for every other segment PQ in F (other than AB), the point C must not lie on PQ.

Hmm. So, for any other PQ in F, which connects (a, 0) to (0, b) where a² + b² = 1, the point C must not lie on PQ. 

But how do we characterize point C such that it's only on AB and none of the other PQs?

Alternatively, perhaps point C is the intersection point of AB with all possible PQs, but only AB passes through C. That might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is such that any other PQ in F that passes through C would have to coincide with AB.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to parametrize all the segments PQ in F and then find the point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB. So, for each other PQ, we can write their equations and make sure that C doesn't lie on any of them.

But since there are infinitely many PQs in F, we can't check each individually. There must be a more geometric way to approach this.

Wait, perhaps point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all these PQ segments. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, the point C would be the point of tangency on AB from this envelope.

Alternatively, maybe C is the point where AB is the only PQ passing through
