Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. That is, we're looking for P(Grand Prize | Prize won). From what I remember, conditional probability is calculated as P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, A is the event that she wins the grand prize, and B is the event that she wins a prize.

Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers correct, which is a subset of winning a prize (because having all four correct means at least two are correct), then A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to find P(A) and P(B), then divide them.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways to pick 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 elements, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4). C stands for combination, right? So C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = 210.

So, total possible combinations are 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. Since she has to pick all four numbers correctly, there's only one such combination. So, P(A) is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, P(B) is the probability that she wins a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are in the randomly chosen four. So, this can be calculated as 1 minus the probability that fewer than two numbers are correct. That is, 1 - [probability of exactly 0 correct + probability of exactly 1 correct].

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute it directly by summing the probabilities of exactly 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers. Either way, let's see.

Wait, in this case, since the problem is about conditional probability, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of favorable outcomes for B and then divide by the total number of possible outcomes. Let me think.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S is 210. The number of ways she can have at least two correct is the sum of the number of ways to have exactly 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers.

So, let's compute each of these.

First, exactly 4 correct: that's just 1 way, because she has to pick all four numbers correctly.

Exactly 3 correct: How many ways can this happen? Well, she picks 3 correct numbers and 1 incorrect number. The number of ways to choose 3 correct numbers from her 4 is C(4,3). The number of ways to choose 1 incorrect number from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10, and she picked 4, so 10 - 4 = 6) is C(6,1). So, the number of ways is C(4,3) * C(6,1).

Similarly, exactly 2 correct: C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because she picks 2 correct from her 4 and 2 incorrect from the remaining 6.

And exactly 1 correct: C(4,1) * C(6,3). Exactly 0 correct: C(4,0) * C(6,4). But for P(B), we need at least 2 correct, so we'll sum exactly 2, exactly 3, exactly 4.

So, let's calculate each term.

Exactly 4 correct: 1.

Exactly 3 correct: C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Exactly 2 correct: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for B is 1 + 24 + 90 = 115.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

C(4,3) is 4, C(6,1) is 6, so 4*6=24. Correct.

C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is (6*5)/(2*1)=15, so 6*15=90. Correct.

So 1 + 24 + 90 = 115. So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115.

Therefore, P(B) is 115
