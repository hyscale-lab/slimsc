Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the problem states that we have a list of positive integers with three properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Our goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. I'll start by recalling some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.
- **Median**: The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of items, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem specifies that the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, especially for odd-length lists. So, this suggests that the list might have an even number of elements because the median would then be an average of two numbers, potentially not in the list.

Wait, but if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So, for the median to be an integer not present in the list, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, and their average must not be in the list. So, the two middle numbers could be consecutive integers, but their average would be a half-integer, but the median is supposed to be an integer. Hmm, that's a contradiction. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Let's clarify: The median is an integer, but it's not in the list. So, if the median is an integer, and it's not in the list, then the two middle numbers must add up to twice that integer, right? For example, if the median is 5, then the two middle numbers must add up to 10, so numbers like 4 and 6 would average to 5. But 5 isn't in the list. So that would work.

So, okay, so the list has an even number of elements, and the two middle numbers are equidistant from the median but not equal to it.

Wait, but if the two middle numbers are the same, then the median would be that same number, which would be in the list. So, for the median to not be in the list, the two middle numbers must be different, and their average has to be an integer. So, their sum must be even, and their average is an integer not in the list.

Alright, so that clarifies that the list has an even number of elements. Let's denote the number of elements as n, which is even. So, n is even.

Also, the mode is 9, which appears more frequently than any other number. So, 9 must occur at least twice, perhaps more
