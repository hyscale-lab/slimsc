Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

"Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A."

Hmm. So Alice picks a set A, and then Bob makes a list of all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of each B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me break this down. First, let's think about what defines each set B. Each B is a finite non-empty set of positive integers, and the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum?

If a is the maximum of B, then all other elements of B must be less than a. So for each a in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, excluding the empty set, because B must be non-empty. Wait, no. Wait, because B can have any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} along with the element a. But actually, since B is a set, the elements have to be distinct, but they can be any positive integers less than a.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, because the elements can be any positive integers, not necessarily consecutive. So if A has a particular element a, then the sets B with maximum a can consist of any subset of positive integers where the maximum is exactly a. That means all elements are less than or equal to a, and at least one element is equal to a.

But wait, the problem says B is a set of positive integers, so elements are unique and positive. So for a given a, the number of sets B where the maximum is a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} that include a. Because each such subset is a set where a is the maximum. So the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1}, since for each element less than a, which are a-1 elements, we can choose whether to include them or not, and we must include a.

So for each a in A, the number of sets B with max a is 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. And according to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So, sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of the elements of A, which would be sum_{a ∈ A} a.

So, we need to find a set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024, and then compute the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. So let's think about how to represent 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. Because 2
