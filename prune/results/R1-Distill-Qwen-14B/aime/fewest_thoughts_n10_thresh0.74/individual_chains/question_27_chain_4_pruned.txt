Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, I remember a torus is like a donut shape, created by rotating a circle around an axis. The problem says the torus T is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, which is 6 units away from the center. So, the main circle has radius 3, and the distance from its center to the axis is 6. Got it.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside and outside of this sphere. When it's inside, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.

Let me visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's also touching along another circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, and I need their difference.

I think I need to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in both cases, and then use that to find the radii of the tangent circles.

Wait, but how exactly do the torus and sphere interact? When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is entirely within it except for the tangent circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's larger, and the sphere is inside, touching along a circle.

First, let me recall the properties of a torus. The torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this problem, R is 6 and r is 3, right? Because the original circle has radius 3, and it's being rotated around an axis 6 units away from its center.

So, R = 6, r = 3.

Now, the sphere has radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is larger than the torus's major radius plus minor radius? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, no. The sphere is radius 11. The torus is a surface, so when resting on the inside, the sphere and torus touch at a single circle. Similarly, when resting on the outside, the sphere is inside the torus, touching along another circle.

I think the key is to find the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center in each case. Hmm, wait, but the torus is a surface of revolution. So, maybe the centers coincide? Or perhaps not.

Wait, the torus is generated by rotating a circle around an axis. So, the center of the generating circle is at distance R from the axis. So, the center
