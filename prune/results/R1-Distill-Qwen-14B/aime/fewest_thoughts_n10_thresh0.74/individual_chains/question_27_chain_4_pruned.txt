Alright, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere, and I need to find the difference between the radii of the circles where they're tangent internally and externally. Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the same plane. The distance from the center of this circle to the axis is 6 units. So, I remember that a torus is like a donut shape, and its geometry is defined by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So, T has R=6 and r=3.

Then, we have a sphere S with radius 11. The problem states two scenarios: when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Okay, so I need to visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, they touch along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they touch along another circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, respectively. I need to find both radii and their difference.

I think I should recall how a torus can be tangent to a sphere. The sphere is perfectly symmetrical, so the point (or in this case, the circle) of tangency should lie along the axis of symmetry. Wait, but the torus is a surface of revolution, so maybe the circles of tangency lie in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the torus.

Wait, no, the sphere is a different shape. When the torus is inside the sphere, the point closest to the center of the sphere would be the inner part of the torus, and the point farthest would be the outer part. But tangency along a circle suggests that the sphere and torus share a common circle where they just touch.

I think the key here is to find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus when they are tangent. Let me think.

Let me denote the center of the sphere S as point O, and the center of the generating circle of the torus T as point C. Since the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, the major radius is 6, minor radius 3.

In both cases, when T is inside S and when it's outside, the centers O and C must be aligned along the axis of the torus, which is the same as the axis of the generating circle. So, the distance between O and C will be important.

Wait, when T is inside S, the sphere is larger, so the distance between O and C would be such that the sphere touches the inner part of the torus. Similarly, when T is outside, the sphere is smaller relative to the torus, and the distance between O and C would be different.

Wait, but the sphere has a fixed radius of 11,
