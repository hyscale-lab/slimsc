Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me break this down. I remember that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the primes start at 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.

I need to check for each prime p, starting from the smallest, whether there exists an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². The first such p is what I'm looking for.

Wait, but how do I check if n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²? Well, for a prime p, p² divides n⁴ + 1 if and only if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

So, I need to find the smallest prime p where there exists an integer n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I think I remember that for primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, then maybe such an n exists. Or maybe even more specifically, for primes where certain conditions hold, like p ≡ 1 mod 8 or something like that.

Wait, but I'm not too sure. Let me think. Maybe I should check for small primes first and see if any of them satisfy this condition.

Starting with p=2: Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4.

Compute n⁴ mod 4. Let's see: n can be 0,1,2,3 mod 4.

n=0 mod 4: n⁴=0, so n⁴ +1=1 mod 4. Not divisible by 4.

n=1 mod 4: 1⁴=1, so 1+1=2 mod 4. Not divisible by 4.

n=2 mod 4: 16 mod 4 is 0, so 0+1=1 mod 4. Not divisible by 4.

n=3 mod 4: 81 mod 4 is 1, so 1+1=2 mod 4. Not divisible by 4.

So, for p=2, there's no n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So, p=2 is out.

Next prime is p=3.

Check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. So, -1 mod 9 is 8.

So, does there exist n where n⁴ ≡ 8 mod 9?

Let me compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 0 to 8.

n=0: 0⁴=0 → 0 mod 9.

n=1: 1 mod 9 → 1.

n=2: 16 mod 9 → 7.

n=3: 81 mod 9 → 0.

n=4: 256 mod 9. 256 /9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4.

n=5: 625 mod 9. 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. So 4.

n=6: 1296 mod 9 is 0.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod 9: sum the digits of 2401: 2+4+0+1=7. 7 mod 9 is 7. So 7⁴ mod 9 is 7.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod 9: 4+0+9+6=19 → 1+9=10 → 1+0=1. So 1 mod 9.

So the possible n⁴ mod 9 are 0,1,4,7. I don't see 8 in there. So for p=3, no solution. So p=3 is out.

Next prime is p=5.

Check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. -1 mod 25 is 24.

So, does there exist n such that n⁴ ≡24 mod25?

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 0 to 24. But that's a lot. Maybe I can find a pattern or use Euler's theorem.

Euler's theorem says that if n and 25 are coprime, then n^φ(25)=n^20 ≡1 mod25.

So, n^4 cycles with some period dividing 20.

Wait, perhaps I can check small n's.

n=1: 1 -> 1.

n=2: 16.

n=3: 81 mod25=6.
