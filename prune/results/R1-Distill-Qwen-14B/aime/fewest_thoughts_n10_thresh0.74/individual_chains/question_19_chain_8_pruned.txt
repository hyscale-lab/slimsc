Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB · AC.

Hmm. I need to find the product of AB and AC. Let's start by recalling some properties of triangle centers and their relationships.

First, the circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. So, R = 13, r = 6.

The triangle has circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key piece of information. Maybe I can relate this to some known formulas or properties.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that right? Let me think. I think the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Hmm, no, maybe OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Wait, let me confirm. The formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Yes, that's correct.

So plugging in the given values, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me compute that:

13² is 169, 2*13*6 is 156. So OI² = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but in the problem, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So the segment IA is perpendicular to OI. That might imply some right triangle properties.

Let me visualize the triangle. Let me draw triangle ABC, with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI.

So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras theorem:

OA² = IO² + IA²

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. IO we found as sqrt(13). So:

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²

169 = 13 + IA²

So IA² = 169 -13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Simplify sqrt(156): sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).

So IA is 2√39.

I also know that in a triangle, the length of the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = (Area)/(semiperimeter)

But maybe I can relate IA to other quantities. I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be given by some formula. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for IA is sqrt(r² + (s - a)²), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side BC.

Wait, yes, I think that's right. The formula for the length of the inradius from the incenter to a vertex is sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). So IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2).

So, in this case, IA = sqrt(6² + (s - a)^2) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2). We found IA as 2√39, so:

sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2) = 2√39

Let me square both sides:

36 + (s - a)^2 = 4*39 = 156

So, (s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120

Therefore, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)

So, s - a = 2√30.

Similarly, I can find s - b and s - c, but maybe I don't need them right now.

But let's think about the semiperimeter s. s = (a + b + c)/2.

Wait, but I'm trying to find AB · AC. AB is side c, and AC is side b. So I need to find b*c.

I remember in triangles, there are several formulas involving sides and radii. Maybe I can find expressions for b and c, or relate them to other known quantities.

Given R = 13, the circumradius, and r = 6, the inradius. Also, we have OI = sqrt(13), and IA = 2√39.

Let me recall that the area of the triangle can be given by r*s, where s is semiperimeter.

Also, area can be given by (a*b*c)/(4R).
