Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD², where BD is one of the diagonals of the rhombus.

First, I should recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Also, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation.

Let me denote the points as follows: Let’s say the diagonals are AC and BD. Since the rhombus is formed by these two diagonals, each vertex is the intersection of the diagonals. Wait, no, that's not right. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so each diagonal is divided into two equal parts by the other. Therefore, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the coordinates of the points must be such that if one point is (x, y), the opposite point is (-x, -y). So, for instance, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, B and D must be symmetric with respect to the origin.

But since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distances AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal.

Hmm, perhaps I can parametrize the points on the hyperbola. Since hyperbola equations can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. For a hyperbola of the form x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, a parametrization is (a secθ, b tanθ) or (a cosh t, b sinh t). Wait, but perhaps I can use coordinates (x, y) in terms of some parameter.

Alternatively, since the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin, perhaps I can consider that the points are (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s). But since it's a rhombus, the sides must be equal.

Wait, no, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the four points are such that each pair of adjacent points forms equal length sides. So, if I have points A, B, C, D in order, then AB = BC = CD = DA.

But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint, the coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, similarly for B and D. So, points are A, B, -A, -B, in order maybe? Wait, not necessarily, because the order matters for the rhombus.

Wait, let me think. Let’s denote the points as A, B, C, D in order, so that ABCD is a rhombus. Then, the midpoints of the diagonals AC and BD are both the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then
