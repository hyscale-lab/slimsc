Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let's see what I need to do. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with its diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds like finding the supremum of BD², and then taking the floor or something? Wait, no, the question says the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, it's like the infimum of BD², but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The greatest number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi would be the lower bound of BD². So, if BD² can get as small as possible, but not below a certain value, then that value is the answer. Or maybe I have it backwards. Let me think again. If we're looking for the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, that would mean BD² is always larger than this number. So, that number would be the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD². So, I need to find the minimum possible BD² such that all rhombi have BD² greater than this number. So, the maximum lower bound.

But wait, another thought: maybe BD² can be as large as possible, but the question is about the greatest number less than BD² for all. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the problem again: "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's the supremum of all numbers less than BD² across all rhombi. So, if BD² can approach some value from above, the greatest lower bound would be that value. Alternatively, if BD² has a minimum value, then the answer would be that minimum, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Let me parse the question again. The problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, if for all rhombi, BD² is greater than this number, and this number is the largest such. So, that
