Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there's a lot of symmetry which might help in counting the rectangles.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 equal sides and 12 equal angles. Since it's regular, all the sides and angles are the same. Now, the problem is about rectangles formed by sides or diagonals of this dodecagon. So, each rectangle's sides must align with either the sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals.

I think the key here is to realize that in a regular polygon, especially when it's a dodecagon, the diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a regular polygon, the length of a diagonal depends on the number of sides it spans. So, in a dodecagon, the diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 5 vertices because beyond that, they start repeating on the other side. Wait, no, actually, in a 12-gon, the maximum unique skip would be 5 because skipping 6 would bring you back to the same point but on the opposite side, but since it's even, perhaps that's a diameter?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how a rectangle is formed. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. So, in the dodecagon, we need to find all sets of four points (vertices) such that the sides connecting them form two pairs of parallel and equal sides, and the angles are 90 degrees. Hmm, but wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals have specific angles between them, so rectangles might not be as straightforward as in a grid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a circle. If I think of the dodecagon as being on a unit circle, each vertex corresponds to a point on the circumference at angles of 30 degrees apart (since 360/12 = 30). So, the vertices are at angles 0째, 30째, 60째, ..., up to 330째.

Now, if I can represent each vertex as a complex number or a point in polar coordinates, maybe I can find conditions for four points forming a rectangle. But that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of vectors or coordinate geometry.

Wait, another approach: in a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be thought of as vectors. For a rectangle, the sides must be perpendicular and of equal length in their respective pairs. So, maybe I can find all pairs of vectors that are perpendicular and equal in length, and then see how they can form rectangles.

But that might not directly give me the count. Another thought: in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, the concept of diameters is important. The diameters are diagonals that pass through the center, effectively connecting opposite vertices. In a dodecagon, each diameter would connect a vertex to the one six steps away (since 12/2 = 6). So, for example, vertex 1 is connected via diameter to vertex 7.

Wait, but for a rectangle, the opposite sides must not only be equal but also parallel. So, in the dodecagon, sides of the polygon and certain diagonals can serve as the sides of the rectangle. So, perhaps I can choose two different lengths of parallel sides and see how they can form rectangles.

Let me think: in a regular dodecagon, the sides can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. So, the side length (which skips 0 vertices) is the shortest. Then, skipping 1 vertex gives a diagonal, which is longer, skipping 2 vertices gives an even longer diagonal, and so on up to
