Okay, so I need to solve this problem about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what exactly a b-eautiful number is. The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. So, 81 is 9 squared, right?

So, the task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. That means I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the two conditions above.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's understand how a two-digit number in base b relates to its value in base 10. A two-digit number in base b is written as 'd1 d0' where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. So, the value of this number in base 10 is d1 * b + d0. Here, d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so they must satisfy 0 ≤ d1, d0 < b. Also, since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. So, d1 is from 1 to b-1, and d0 is from 0 to b-1.

The sum of the digits is d1 + d0, and this sum must equal the square root of n. But n is equal to d1*b + d0. So, mathematically, we can write:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms to make it easier. Let's group like terms:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of d1. Let me denote this as:

A*d1^2 + B*d1 + C = 0

Where:
A = 1
B = 2*d0 - b
C = d0^2 - d0

Since d1 is an integer between 1 and b-1, we can think of this quadratic equation in d1 and try to find solutions for each d0.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is better. Let's think about the equation again:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me denote S = d1 + d0. Then, S^2 = d1*b + d0.

But since S = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as S - d1. Substituting into the equation:

S^2 = d1*b + (S - d1)

Simplify the right side:

S^2 = b*d1 + S - d1

Factor d1:

S^2 = d1*(b - 1) + S

Then, rearranged:

d1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S

So, d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)

But remember, d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive. So, (S^2 - S) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer d1 in the correct range.

Also, since d0 = S - d1, and d0 must satisfy 0 ≤ d0 < b. So, S - d1 must be in this range.

Wait, so for given b, we can vary S and see whether d1 is an integer between 1 and b-1, and d0 is between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can fix S and then for each S, find possible b's that satisfy the equation.

But given that we need to find the minimal b such that there are more than 10 b-eautiful numbers, perhaps it's better to think for each b, how many solutions (d1, d0) exist.

Alternatively, maybe for a given b, the number of possible S (sum of digits) that can result in valid d1 and d0.

Let me think about how to model this. For a given b, and for each possible S, can we find d1 and d0 such that:

1. d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)
2. d0 = S - d1
3. d1 is between 1 and b-1
4. d0 is between 0 and b-1, and less than b

Wait, but S is the sum d1 + d0. So, since d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, S is at least 1. Also, since d1 is at most b-1 and d0 is at most b-1, S is at most 2*(b-1). So, possible S ranges from 1 to 2*(b-1).

But to have d1 as an integer, (S^2 - S) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (S^2 - S) mod (b - 1) must be zero.

Alternatively, (S)(S-1) must be divisible by (b-1). So, for each b, the number of S in [1, 2*(b-1)] such that (b-1) divides S(S-1).

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but perhaps manageable.

Wait, but maybe I can approach this differently. Let's consider that (b-1) must divide S(S-1). So, for each b, the number of S such that (b-1) divides S(S-1) and the resulting d1 and d0 are valid digits in base b.

But perhaps another way is to think of S as varying, and for each S, b can be expressed as (S^2 - S)/(d1) + 1. Because from the equation:

d1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S

So, b = (S^2 - S)/d1 + 1

Since d1 must be a positive integer, for each S, possible d1's must be divisors of (S^2 - S). So, for each S, we can find the number of possible d1's such that when we compute b, it's an integer greater than or equal to 2, and also ensuring that d0 = S - d1 is a valid digit (i.e., 0 ≤ d0 < b).

Wait, this seems more promising. So, for each S, find all possible d1 that divide (S^2 - S), compute b = (S^2 - S)/d1 + 1, and then check if d0 = S - d1 is less than b (since d0 < b). Also
