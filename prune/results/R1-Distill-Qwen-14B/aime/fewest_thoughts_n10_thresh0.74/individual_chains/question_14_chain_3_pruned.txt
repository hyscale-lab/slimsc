Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the solution step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property here is that if any single digit of N is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. That's interesting. So changing any digit (units, tens, hundreds, or thousands place) to 1 makes the number divisible by 7.

I need to find the greatest such N, meaning I should probably start looking from 9999 downwards and check this condition, but that seems time-consuming. There must be a smarter way to approach this.

Let me break down the problem. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So A is the thousands digit, B is hundreds, C is tens, and D is units. Each of these digits can be from 0 to 9, except A which can't be 0 because it's a four-digit number.

The condition is that if any single digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1, B to 1, C to 1, or D to 1 should each result in a number divisible by 7.

Wait, but N is the original number. So, when you change a digit to 1, you get a new number. Each of these new numbers must be divisible by 7.

Let me think about how changing a digit affects the number's divisibility. Maybe I can express N in terms of its digits and then see what conditions must hold when a digit is changed.

N can be expressed as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change a digit to 1, for example, changing A to 1 gives us a new number N1 = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D, and so on.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, I can write these as congruences.

Let me write them out:

1. Changing A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

Which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

Similarly,

2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

Which is 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D ≡ 0 mod 7

Which is 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7

4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these four congruences must hold.

But I also know that N itself is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Let's denote N as such.

So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, the idea is that when we change any one digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, perhaps I can express each of these conditions in terms of N and the digit being changed.

Let me compute each of these four new numbers in terms of N and the digit change.

First, when changing A to 1: N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A). Because the original N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, so subtracting 1000A gives 100B + 10C + D, and adding 1000 gives N1.

Similarly,

N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000A) = N - 1000A + 1000 = N + 1000*(1 - A)

Similarly, for changing B to 1:

N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = N - 100B + 100 = N + 100*(1 - B)

Similarly, for changing C to 1:

N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D = N - 10C + 10 = N + 10*(1 - C)

And for changing D to 1:

N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N - D + 1 = N + (1 - D)

So, each of these four numbers can be expressed as N plus some multiple of (1 - digit), where digit is A, B, C, or D.

Since each of these must be divisible by 7, we can write:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 => (N + 1000*(1 - A)) ≡ 0 mod 7

Similarly,

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7 => (N + 100*(1 - B)) ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7 => (N + 10*(1 - C)) ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7 => (N + (1 - D)) ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these expressions must be 0 modulo 7.

I can rearrange each congruence:

1. N ≡ -1000*(1 - A) mod 7

2. N ≡ -100*(1 - B) mod 7

3. N ≡ -10*(1 - C) mod 7

4. N ≡ -(1 - D) mod 7

Since all four of these must be equal to N mod 7, we can set them equal to each other.

So,

-1000*(1 - A) ≡ -100*(1 - B) ≡ -10*(1 - C) ≡ -(1 - D) mod 7

Which implies that:

1000*(1 - A) ≡ 100*(1 - B) ≡ 10*(1 - C) ≡ (1 - D) mod 7

So, all four expressions are congruent modulo 7.

Let me compute each coefficient modulo 7 to simplify.

First, 1000 mod 7:

Since 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, because 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

And 1 mod7 is 1.

So, substituting back:

1000*(1 - A) ≡ 6*(1 - A) mod7

100*(1 - B) ≡ 2*(1 - B) mod7

10*(1 - C) ≡3*(1 - C) mod7

(1 - D) ≡1*(1 - D) mod7

So, all of these must be congruent mod7.

So we have:

6*(1 - A) ≡ 2*(1 - B) ≡ 3*(1 - C) ≡ (1 - D) mod7

Let me denote this common value as k mod7, so:

6*(1 - A) ≡ k,

2*(1 - B) ≡ k,

3*(1 - C) ≡ k,

(1 - D) ≡ k.

So, all four expressions equal to the same k modulo7.

So, from these, I can write:

1 - A ≡ k/6 mod7,

1 - B ≡ k/2 mod7,

1 - C ≡ k/3 mod7,

1 - D ≡ k mod7.

But division in modular arithmetic isn't straightforward. Let me find the modular inverses.

First, 6 mod7 is 6, so its inverse is a number x such that 6x ≡1 mod7.

Testing: 6*6=36≡1 mod7 (since 7*5=35, 36-35=1). So inverse of 6 is 6.

Similarly, inverse of 2 mod7: 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So inverse of 2 is 4.

Inverse of 3 mod7: 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So inverse of 3 is 5.

So, 1 - A ≡ k * 6 mod7,

1 - B ≡ k * 4 mod7,

1 - C ≡ k *5 mod7,

1 - D ≡k mod7.

Let me write:

(1 - A) ≡6k mod7,

(1 - B) ≡4k mod7,

(1 - C) ≡5k mod7,

(1 - D) ≡k mod7.

So, each of these expressions is a multiple of k, with specific coefficients.

Now, since all four expressions must be congruent mod7, perhaps I can express each 1 - digit in terms of k. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express all four in terms of k and find a relationship.

Let me consider that all four expressions are equal to k, 4k, 5k, 6k modulo7, respectively.

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify:

From the above, each (1 - digit) is equal to some multiple of k.

Wait, no, wait: (1 - A) is 6k mod7,

(1 - B) is 4k mod7,

(1 - C) is 5k mod7,

(1 - D) is k mod7.

So, all four of these expressions are multiples of k, with specific coefficients.

But since (1 - A), (1 - B), etc., are all digits, they must be between 0 and 9, but since A, B, C, D are digits, 1 - A can be from (1-9)= -8 to (1-0)=1. So, (1 - A) can be from -8 to 1.

But modulo7, these can be represented as 0 to 6 or negative equivalents.

Wait, but perhaps instead of considering the actual digits, I can model this in terms of k.

Since all four expressions are connected via k, perhaps we can find that k must be the same for all.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently.

Since all four expressions must be equal to k mod7, but with different coefficients, perhaps I can relate them to each other.

Let me write:

(1 - A) ≡6k mod7,

(1 - B) ≡4k mod7,

(1 - C) ≡5k mod7,

(1 - D) ≡k mod7.

So, from the first equation, (1 - A) is 6k mod7. From the second, (1 - B) is 4k mod7. So, 6k ≡ (1 - A) mod7,

Similarly, 4k ≡ (1 - B) mod7.

So, (1 - A) ≡6k,

(1 - B) ≡4k,

(1 - C) ≡5k,

(1 - D)≡k.

So, perhaps I can write these as:

(1 - A) =6k +7m,

(1 - B)=4k +7n,

(1 - C)=5k +7p,

(1 - D)=k +7q,

where m, n, p, q are integers.

But since (1 - A), etc., are integers between -8 and 1, the only possible values for 7m, 7n, etc., would be 0 or -7, because 7 is larger than 8, so if m is non-zero, (1 - A) would be less than -7, which is not possible. Wait: (1 - A) can be as low as -8 (when A=9) or as high as 1 (when A=0). So, for (1 - A) =6k +7m, 7m must be such that 6k +7m is between -8 and 1.

Similarly for the others.

Let me consider possible values of k. Since k is mod7, it can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Let me consider k=0.

If k=0, then all four expressions become 0 mod7.

So,

(1 - A) ≡0 mod7,

(1 - B)≡0 mod7,

(1 - C)≡0 mod7,

(1 - D
