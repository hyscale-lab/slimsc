Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. Since ω isn't equal to 1, it's one of the primitive roots.

The product given is over all k from 0 to 12, which includes all the 13th roots of unity. So, ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the distinct 13th roots of unity. That might come in handy.

Looking at the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me rewrite it as 2 + (-2ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to a known polynomial.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Let me let x = ω^k, which is a root of x^13 = 1. So the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Let me factor that.

Looking at 2 - 2x + x^2, is that factorable? Let me see: x^2 - 2x + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so it doesn't factor into real numbers. Hmm. Maybe I can write it as x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0 and find its roots, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this quadratic to something else. Since we're dealing with roots of unity, maybe cyclotomic polynomials come into play here.

Wait, the 13th cyclotomic polynomial is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that relates directly to the given product.

Alternatively, I remember that the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. But in our case, we have a product of expressions involving ω^k, but not just (x - ω^k). So maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the given product as the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote that as P. So P = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

I wonder if I can write each term in a way that relates to a polynomial evaluated at a certain point. For example, if I can write 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} as f(ω^k) for some polynomial f, then the product over all k would be the product over f(ω^k).

Let me think about f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2. Then, P is the product of f(ω^k) for k=0 to 12.

Hmm, the product of f(ω^k) over all 13th roots of unity ω^k. There's a theorem that says that the product over (a - ω^k) is related to the resultant or something, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the product of f(ω^k) over all k is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 - 1, or maybe it's the product of f(ω^k) which can be related to the value of the polynomial at certain points.

Alternatively, I remember that if f(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0, then the product over (f(ω^k)) when ω is a primitive mth root of unity is equal to the product of f(ζ^j) for each primitive mth root ζ, but I might be mixing up some concepts here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can express the product P as the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me
