Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make it possible for Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. This seems like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that for such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

In this case, since Alice goes first, if the starting position n is a losing position, then Bob can win. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where the starting position is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe I can use dynamic programming or recursion to figure out the winning and losing positions. Let's define a function W(n) where W(n) is true if the current player can win when there are n tokens, and false otherwise.

The base cases would be when n is 0, which is a losing position because there are no tokens to take. Wait, but n=0, the game is already over. So, the player who can't make a move loses, so if n=0, the current player has lost. So, W(0) = false.

For n=1, the current player can take 1 token and win, so W(1)=true.

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who will then take it and win. Wait, wait, that's not right. If the player takes 1, opponent is left with 1 and can take it to win. So, n=2: if current player takes 1, opponent can win. But wait, can the current player take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So, the current player can only take 1, which leaves 1 for the opponent, who takes it and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So W(2)=false.

Wait, no, if n=1, the current player takes 1 and wins. So for n=2, the current player takes 1, opponent gets n=1, which is a winning position for them. So the current player can't force a win in n=2. So W(2)=false.

n=3: The current player can take 1, leaving 2 for the opponent, which is a losing position for them. So W(3)=true.

n=4: The current player can take 4 tokens and win. So W(4)=true.

n=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4 for the opponent, who can win by taking all 4. Or take 4, leaving 1, which the opponent can take and win. So, regardless of what the current player does, the opponent can win. So W(5)=false.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, if n=5, the current player can take 1, leaving 4. Then the opponent can take 4 and win. Or take 4,
