Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. The problem says that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB·AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius (R) is given as 13, and the inradius (r) is 6. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle.

The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter I and circumcenter O. That seems important. Maybe I can use some vector geometry or coordinate geometry here, but I'm not sure yet.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. I think the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me check that. Yes, I think that's right because it relates the distance between the incenter and circumradius. So, substituting the given values:

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13.

So OI = sqrt(13). That's useful.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem:

IA² + OI² = OA²

Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So,

IA² + (sqrt(13))² = 13²
IA² + 13 = 169
IA² = 169 - 13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

So IA is 2√39.

Hmm, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I remember that the length of the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.

Wait, another thought: There's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. Let me recall. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:

IA = √[ (s)(s - a) ] / (r)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A can be expressed using the formula:

IA = r / sin(A/2)

Where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Is that correct? Let me verify.

Yes, I think that's right. Because in the triangle formed by the inradius and angle bisector, the distance IA can be expressed as r divided by sin(A/2). So,

IA = r / sin(A/2)
So, we have IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39

Wait, so:

6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39

So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = (3√39) / 39 = √39 / 13

Wait, because 3/√39 is equal to (3√39)/39, which simplifies to √39 / 13. So,

sin(A/2) = √39 / 13

Let me compute that value. What's the angle A? Hmm, not sure yet, but maybe I can find the cosine of A using double-angle formula.

Since sin(A/2) = √39 / 13, then cos(A/2)
