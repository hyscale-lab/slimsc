Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. Wait, no, more specifically, the point where the tangents from a common external point meet is called the external homothety center or something. But maybe I don't need that term right now.

Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, BD and CD are tangents to ω. I remember that from a point outside a circle, the lengths of the two tangents to the circle are equal. So, BD = CD. That should be useful. 

Now, line AD intersects ω again at P. So, AD is a secant of the circle, passing through A and P. I think there might be some theorem related to secants and tangents here. Maybe the Power of a Point theorem? Yes, that's the one. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the length of the tangent from D to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points where any secant from D intersects the circle.

In other words, for point D, BD² = DA * DP. Because BD is the tangent, and DA and DP are the parts of the secant AD. So, BD² = DA * DP.

I need to find AP, which is part of the secant AD. So if I can find DA and DP, then AP = DP - DA, or maybe DA - DP, depending on the order. Wait, no. Actually, AD is a secant that starts at A, goes through P, and ends at D. So, the Power of a Point formula should be BD² = DP * DA, where DA is the entire secant, from D through P to A. So, actually, DP is the external segment, and DA is the entire secant. Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, the Power of a Point theorem says that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent, which is BD², and it should equal the product of the lengths of the entire secant segment and its external part. So, if the secant is from D through P to A, then the external part is DP, and the entire secant is DP + PA, but that might complicate things. Wait, no, let me clarify.

Wait, the Power of a Point formula is: If a
