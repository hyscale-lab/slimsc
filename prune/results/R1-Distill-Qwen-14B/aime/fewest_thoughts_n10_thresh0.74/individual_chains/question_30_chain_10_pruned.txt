Okay, so I have this problem to solve: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because ω ≠ 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Maybe that will come into play later.

The expression I need to compute is a product over k from 0 to 12, so it's considering all the 13th roots of unity, including 1. Wait, but ω is defined as not equal to 1. Hmm, so does the product include k=0, which would give ω^0 = 1? Let me check: when k=0, the term is (2 - 2*1 + 1²) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So the first term is 1. Then for k=1 to 12, we have other roots. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product for k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So, actually, the product can be written as the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) which is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), since the k=0 term is 1.

Hmm, okay. So perhaps I can think of this product as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points. Let me see.

Let me denote f(x) = 2 - 2x + x². Then the product we're looking at is the product of f(ω^k) for k=0 to 12. But since for k=0, f(1) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1, as I saw earlier, the total product is the product from k=0 to 12 of f(ω^k). But the product of f(ω^k) for all k is the same as evaluating the resultant or something similar?

Wait, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x¹³ - 1. But in this case, it's the product of f(ω^k). Maybe I can relate this to evaluating another polynomial at x= something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product over all k of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) as the product over all ω^k of f(ω^k), where f(x) = x² - 2
