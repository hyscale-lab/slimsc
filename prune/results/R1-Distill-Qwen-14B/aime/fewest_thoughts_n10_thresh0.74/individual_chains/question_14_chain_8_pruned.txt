Okay, so I have this problem here that I need to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number, the largest possible, such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, when I divide N by 1000, Q is the quotient and R is the remainder. I have to compute Q + R.

Let me break this down.

First, N is a four-digit number. So, it's between 1000 and 9999, inclusive. But since it's the greatest, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards.

The main property is that changing any one digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, regardless of which digit I change to 1 (whether it's the thousands, hundreds, tens, or units place), the resulting number must be a multiple of 7.

This seems like a tricky condition because it has to hold for all four digits. So, for N, if I change the thousands digit to 1, it's divisible by 7; same with hundreds, tens, and units.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are digits, and a is not zero since it's a four-digit number.

So, the digits are: thousands place (a), hundreds place (b), tens place (c), units place (d).

When we change a digit to 1, each of these changes can result in a different number. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's represent N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Now, if I change the thousands digit (a) to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d. Similarly, changing the hundreds digit to 1 gives 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d, and so on.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, we can write four separate congruence conditions:

1. When a is changed to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. When b is changed to 1: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. When c is changed to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. When d is changed to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these four conditions must hold.

Alternatively, I can think of each condition as:

For condition 1: (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) mod 7 = 0.

Similarly for the others.

Since we're dealing with modulo 7, perhaps it's easier to compute each coefficient modulo 7.

Let me compute the coefficients of each digit position modulo 7.

First, 1000 mod 7: Let's compute that.

What's 1000 divided by 7? 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. Hence, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 and computing the value modulo 7.

Let me write down the four conditions again with mod 7:

1. (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. (6a + 2 + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. (6a + 2b + 3 + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. (6a + 2b + 3c + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these four congruence equations must hold.

So, now we have four equations:

Equation 1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

These are four equations in four variables: a, b, c, d. But a, b, c, d are digits, so they are integers between 0 and 9, with a ≠ 0.

But since N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, I should look for the largest possible N, which is 9999, and check if it satisfies these conditions. If not, move to 9998, etc., until I find the correct N.

But solving this directly for each N from 9999 downwards may take a long time. Maybe I can find a smarter way by solving the equations.

Let me see if I can express the equations in terms of each other.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

Equation 2 minus Equation 1:

(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7

Simplify:

6a + 2 -6 -2b = 6a - 2b -4 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7

Let me write that as:

6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7. Let's note this as equation 5.

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

Equation 3 minus Equation 2:

(6a + 2b +3 + d) - (6a + 2 + 3c + d) ≡ 0 -0 mod7

Simplify:

2b +3 -2 -3c = 2b -3c +1 ≡0 mod7

So, 2b -3c +1 ≡0 mod7. Let me call this equation 6.

Similarly, subtract equation 3 from equation 4:

Equation4 - equation3: (6a +2b +3c +1) - (6a +2b +3 +d) ≡0-0 mod7

Simplify:

3c +1 -3 -d = 3c -d -2 ≡0 mod7.

So, 3c -d ≡2 mod7. Let's call this equation7.

And subtract equation1 from equation4:

Equation4 - equation1: (6a + 2b +3c +1) - (6 +2b +3c +d) ≡0 -0 mod7

Simplify:

6a +2b +3c +1 -6 -2b -3c -d = 6a -5 -d ≡0 mod7

So, 6a -d ≡5 mod7. Let's call this equation8.

So now, I have equations5,6,7,8.

Equation5: 6a -2b ≡4 mod7

Equation6: 2b -3c ≡-1 mod7 (since 2b -3c +1 ≡0 → 2b -3c ≡ -1 mod7)

Equation7: 3c -d ≡2 mod7

Equation8: 6a -d ≡5 mod7

Hmm, perhaps I can express variables in terms of others.

Let me see equation5: 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

I can write this as 6a ≡ 2b +4 mod7. Let me note that 6 is congruent to -1 mod7, so 6a ≡ -a mod7. So, equation5 becomes:

-a ≡ 2b +4 mod7 → a ≡ -2b -4 mod7.

Similarly, equation6: 2b -3c ≡ -1 mod7.

Let me write this as 2b ≡3c -1 mod7.

Equation7: 3c -d ≡2 mod7 → d ≡3c -2 mod7.

Equation8: 6a -d ≡5 mod7.

But from equation7, d ≡3c -2 mod7. Let me substitute d into equation8:

6a - (3c -2) ≡5 mod7 →6a -3c +2 ≡5 mod7 →6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Again, 6 ≡-1 mod7, so 6a ≡-a, so:

-a -3c ≡3 mod7 → -(a +3c) ≡3 → a +3c ≡-3 mod7 → a +3c ≡4 mod7.

So, a +3c ≡4 mod7. Let's call this equation9.

So, now, let's see:

From equation5: a ≡ -2b -4 mod7.

From equation6: 2b ≡3c -1 mod7.

From equation9: a +3c ≡4 mod7.

Let me try to express a in terms of b and c.

Wait, equation5 gives a in terms of b:

a ≡ -2b -4 mod7.

Equation6 relates b and c: 2b ≡3c -1 mod7.

Equation9: a +3c ≡4 mod7.

Since a ≡ -2b -4 mod7, substitute into equation9:

(-2b -4) +3c ≡4 mod7 →-2b +3c -4 ≡4 mod7 →-2b +3c ≡8 mod7 →-2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

Wait, but equation6 says 2b ≡3c -1 mod7.

Let me write equation6 again: 2b ≡3c -1 mod7 → Rearranged, 3c ≡2b +1 mod7.

So, substituting 3c from equation6 into equation9's substitution:

-2b + (2b +1) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

-2b +2b +1 ≡1 mod7 →1≡1 mod7.

So, this is always true. Therefore, equations5,6,9 are consistent and don't give any new information beyond equation6 and equation5.

So, perhaps I can proceed by expressing variables in terms of others.

Let me think of parameterizing some variables.

Let me pick variable c as a parameter, then express b in terms of c from equation6, then a in terms of b (hence c), and then d in terms of c from equation7.

Then, once I have a, b, c, d in terms of c, perhaps I can find possible values of c that make a, b, d digits (i.e., 0 ≤ a,b,c,d ≤9 and a≠0).

Wait, but a is a digit from 1 to9, and b, c, d from 0 to9.

So, let me proceed step by step.

From equation6: 2b ≡3c -1 mod7.

So, 2b ≡(3c -1) mod7.

We can write b ≡ (3c -1)/2 mod7.

But division by 2 mod7 is multiplication by 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So, 2^{-1} mod7 is 4.

Hence, b ≡ (3c -1)*4 mod7.

Compute (3c -1)*4 mod7:

= 12c -4 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5, and -4 mod7 is 3. So,

=5c +3 mod7.

So, b ≡5c +3 mod7.

Since b must be a digit (0 ≤b ≤9), the possible values of b are (5c +3) mod7, but we need to find b such that b ≡5c +3 mod7, and 0 ≤b ≤9.

Similarly, from equation5: a ≡-2b -4 mod7.

Again, a is a digit, 1 ≤a ≤9.

So, let's express a in terms of b:

a ≡(-2b -4) mod7.

But since a is a digit, it must be in 1-9, so a = [(-2b -4) mod7] +7*k, where k is integer such that a is in 1-9.

Similarly, from equation7: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

d is a digit, 0 ≤d ≤9, so d = (3c -2) mod7 +7*m, where m is integer to make d in 0-9.

So, let me attempt to express all variables in terms of c.

Given that, let's outline:

1. For a given c (0 ≤c ≤9), compute b ≡5c +3 mod7. So, b can be 5c +3, 5c +3 +7, 5c +3 +14, etc., but since b is a digit, 0 ≤b ≤9, we'll have to find b as (5c +3) mod7, and then add 7 if necessary.

Wait, no, 5c +3 could be greater than 7, so b is (5c +3) mod7, but if 5c +3 is negative, we can add 7 to make it positive. Alternatively, b is the remainder when (5c +3) is divided by 7, but since 5c +3 is positive, b is just (5c +3) mod7.

Wait, but 5c +3 could be up to 5*9 +3=48, so mod7, 48 mod7 is 6 (since 7*6=42, 48-42=6). So, b can be from 0 to6, but wait, 5c +3 for c from 0 to9:

c=0: 3 →b=3 mod7=3

c=1:8 →8 mod7=1

c=2:13 mod7=6

c=3:18 mod7=4

c=4:23 mod7=2

c=5:28 mod7=0

c=6:33 mod7=5

c=7:38 mod7=3

c=8:43 mod7=1

c=9:48 mod7=6

So, for each c, b is (5c +3) mod7, which gives b as 3,1,6,4,2,0,5,3,1,6 respectively.

Wait, for c=0, b=3; c=1, b=1; c=2, b=6; c=3, b=4; c=4, b=2; c=5, b=0; c=6, b=5; c=7, b=3; c=8, b=1; c=9, b=6.

So, that gives b for each c.

Then, from equation5: a ≡-2b -4 mod7.

So, a ≡(-2b -4) mod7.

Again, a is a digit from1 to9, so let's compute a for each c.

But since b is known for each c, let's compute a for each c.

Let me make a table for c from 0 to9:

c | b | a ≡ (-2b -4) mod7 | a (digit, 1-9)
---|---|---------------------|------------
0 |3 | (-6 -4)= -10 ≡4 mod7|4
1 |1 | (-2 -4)= -6 ≡1 mod7 |1
2 |6 | (-12 -4)= -16≡-16+21=5 mod7|5
3 |4 | (-8-4)= -12≡-12+14=2 mod7|2
4 |2 | (-4-4)= -8≡-8+7= -1≡6 mod7|6
5 |0 | (0 -4)= -4≡3 mod7|3
6 |5 | (-10-4)= -14≡0 mod7|0 (But a cannot be 0, so need to adjust)
7 |3 | (-6 -4)= -10≡4 mod7|4
8 |1 | (-2 -4)= -6≡1 mod7|1
9 |6 | (-12 -4)= -16≡5 mod7|5

Wait, for c=6, a ≡0 mod7, but a must be at least1, so a=7.

Similarly, for other c where a mod7 is 0, a would be 7, but in our table above, for c=6, the mod7 gives 0, which is a=7.

Wait, let's correct that.

Wait, the a is computed as (-2b -4) mod7. For c=6, b=5:

a ≡ (-2*5 -4) mod7 = (-10 -4)= -14 mod7=0. So, a≡0 mod7. But since a is a digit from1-9, a must be 7.

Similarly, let's go through each c:

c=0: a=4

c=1: a=1

c=2: a=5

c=3: a=2

c=4: a=6

c=5: a=3

c=6: a=7

c=7: a=4

c=8: a=1

c=9: a=5

So that's a for each c.

Now, from equation7: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, compute d for each c:

c | 3c -2 | d mod7 | d (digit, 0-9)
---|------|-------|---
0 | -2 ≡5 mod7 |5
1 |1 |1
2 |4 |4
3 |7 ≡0 |0
4 |10 ≡3 |3
5 |13 ≡6 |6
6 |16 ≡2 |2
7 |19 ≡5 |5
8 |22 ≡1 |1
9 |25 ≡4 |4

So, d is determined as (3c -2) mod7, and then taking the smallest non-negative residue, which is d as above.

So, now, for each c from0 to9, we have a, b, d.

So, N is a four-digit number: a b c d.

Our goal is to find the largest N, which is the largest four-digit number, so we should look for the maximum possible a, then b, then c, then d. But since we have conditions on a, b, c, d, perhaps the maximum N is achieved when a is as large as possible, then b, etc.

Wait, but N is determined by a, b, c, d. Since a is the thousands digit, which has the highest weight, we should try to maximize a first, then b, then c, then d.

From the table, a can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Looking at the table:

c=0: a=4

c=1: a=1

c=2:a=5

c=3:a=2

c=4:a=6

c=5:a=3

c=6:a=7

c=7:a=4

c=8:a=1

c=9:a=5

So, the maximum a is 7, which occurs at c=6. So, let's see if c=6 gives a valid N.

c=6: a=7, b=5, d=2.

So, N=7 5 6 2.

Wait, let me write that as 7562.

Is this N=7562 the maximum? Well, let's check if there are other c with a=7. From the table, a=7 only occurs at c=6.

So, if a=7, c=6. Then, N=7562.

But perhaps we can have a higher N. Because 7562 is a four-digit number, but maybe a higher a is possible. But the maximum a is 7 in our table, so that's the highest possible.

Wait, but wait a second. When a=7, c=6, N=7562. But is that the maximum N? Or is there a higher N with a=7 but higher b, c, d?

Wait, in our setup, for a=7, c=6, which is fixed. Then, b=5, d=2. So, N=7562.

But perhaps, is there a higher N with a=7 but higher b, c, d?

But according to our earlier analysis
