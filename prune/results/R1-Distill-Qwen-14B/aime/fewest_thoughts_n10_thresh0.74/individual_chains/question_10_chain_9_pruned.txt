Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

"Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A."

Alright, so Alice picks some set A, and then Bob creates a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of each B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, let's think about what Bob is doing. For each element a in A, he can form sets B where a is the maximum element. So, for each a in A, the number of possible sets B where a is the max is equal to the number of subsets of the positive integers less than a. Because any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} combined with a will form a set where a is the maximum.

Wait, but in this problem, are the sets B required to be subsets of A, or can they include any positive integers as long as their maximum is in A? I think it's the latter. Because the problem says "all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers" where the maximum is in A. So B can have elements not in A, as long as their maximum is in A.

So, for each a in A, the number of sets B where the maximum is a is equal to 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, you can choose any combination of the numbers from 1 to a-1 to include in B along with a. Each of these combinations is a set with maximum a.

Wait, but that's only true if we're considering all possible subsets. But in reality, B can include numbers larger than a, but that's not possible because the maximum is a. So wait, no. If a is the maximum, all elements of B must be less than or equal to a. So, B is a subset of {1, 2, ..., a} with a being included. So the number of such sets is 2^{a-1}, because we can choose any subset of the numbers less than a and include a.

So, for each a in A, the number of sets B where the maximum is a is 2^{a-1}, right? But wait, that's only if a is the maximum. So, if A has multiple elements, say a1 < a2 < a3, then the sets where the maximum is a1, a2, a3 are all separate. So the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}.

Wait, but let me check that. Suppose A is {1}. Then the only possible set B is {1}, so the number is 2^{1-1} = 1. Correct.

If A is {2}, then the sets B are {2}, {1,2}, so 2^{2-1} = 2. That's correct.

If A is {1,2}, then the number of sets
