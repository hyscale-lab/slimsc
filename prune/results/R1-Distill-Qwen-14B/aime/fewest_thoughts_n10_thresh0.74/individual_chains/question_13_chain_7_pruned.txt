Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because word problems can sometimes trip me up, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says that every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the entire walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, her walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

The question is asking me to find the number of minutes her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is to set up equations based on the information given. Because both scenarios include the same coffee shop time, 't', but different walking speeds and total times. So, I can probably write two equations and solve for 's' and 't'.

Let me jot down what I know:

1. Distance walked each morning: 9 kilometers.
2. When speed is 's' km/h, total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus 't' minutes of coffee shop.
3. When speed is 's + 2' km/h, total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including 't' minutes.
4. We need to find the total time when speed is 's + 1/2' km/h, including 't' minutes.

Wait a second, since time includes both walking and coffee, I should probably convert all times to hours or all to minutes to make it consistent.

Let me choose hours because the speed is in km per hour. So, 4 hours is straightforward. 2 hours and 24 minutes – I can convert 24 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 24/60 is 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours total.

So, for the first scenario:

Total time = walking time + coffee time
4 hours = (time walking) + t/60 hours

Similarly, for the second scenario:

2.4 hours = (time walking at s+2) + t/60 hours.

But I can also express the walking times using the formula: time = distance / speed.

So, for the first case, walking time is 9 / s hours. And the coffee time is t/60 hours, since t is in minutes.

So, equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Now, I have two equations with two variables, 's' and 't'. I can solve these simultaneously.

Let me write them down:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, if I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, I can eliminate 't' since both have t/60.

So:

(9/s + t/60) - (9/(s+2) + t/60) = 4 - 2.4

Simplify left side:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) + (t/60 - t/60) = 1.6

So, the t terms cancel out. Now:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

I can factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me compute the expression in the brackets:

[ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, substituting back:

9 * (2) / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

So, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Now, I can solve for s(s + 2):

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Let me compute 18 divided by 1.6. Hmm, 1.6 goes into 18 how many times?

1.6 * 11 = 17.6, because 1.6 *10=16, 1.6*11=17.6. Then, 18 -17.6=0.4. So it's 11.25.

Wait, let me do it more accurately:

1.6 * x = 18

x = 18 / 1.6

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10: 180 / 16 = 45 / 4 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, solving this quadratic equation for s.

Using the quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 -4ac)] / (2a)

Where a = 1, b = 2, c= -11.25

Discriminant D = (2)^2 - 4*(1)*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

sqrt(49) = 7

So, s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

So, two solutions:

s = (5)/2 = 2.5

s = (-9)/2 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, that seems a bit slow for a walking speed, but okay, maybe Aya walks slowly. Anyway, that's what the math says.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t.

Using equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Plug s =2.5:

9/2.5 + t/60 =4

Compute 9 / 2.5: 2.5 goes into 9 three times with remainder 1.5, which is 3.6. Wait, 2.5*3=7.5, 9 -7.5=1.5. 1.5 /2.5= 0.6. So total 3.6.

So, 3.6 + t/60 =4

Subtract 3.6: t/60 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60: t= 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

So now, we need to find the total time when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

First, compute s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her walking speed is 3 km/h.

Now, compute the walking time: distance / speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Then, add the coffee shop time, which is 24 minutes.

So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Wait, but the problem says to include the t minutes in the total time. So, 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes, which is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 9 km at 3 km/h is indeed 9 /3=3 hours. Plus 24 minutes coffee. So, total time is 3 hours 24 minutes, which is 3*60 +24
