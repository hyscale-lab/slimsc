Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because moving from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid requires 8 right and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves. The catch here is that the path must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I remember that changing direction means switching from moving right to up or up to right. So, for example, if I'm moving right and then switch to up, that's one change. Each time the path alternates between right and up, the count increases.

First, let me think about what it means for a path to change direction exactly four times. If I start at the lower left corner, the first move must be either right or up. Let's suppose it's right. Then the first change would be when I switch to up for the first time. Each subsequent direction change increments the count. So, if I have four changes, how does that affect the structure of the path?

I think the number of direction changes relates to the number of segments in the path. Each time you change direction, you start a new segment. So, if you have four direction changes, how many segments does that make? Well, starting with the first segment, each change adds another segment. So, four changes would mean five segments in total. Because the first segment is one, then each change adds another. Wait, no, if I change direction four times, that should create five segments. For example: if I start right, then up, then right, then up, then right... that would be four changes and five segments. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, each segment must consist of a certain number of steps either to the right or up. So, the key here is to figure out how to distribute the total right and up steps across these segments, with the constraint that each segment alternates direction.

Let me formalize this. Suppose I have a path with four direction changes, which gives five segments. The path alternates direction each time. So, if the first direction is right, the sequence of directions would be right, up, right, up, right. If the first direction is up, it would be up, right, up, right, up. Either way, there are five segments, alternating
