Okay, so I've got this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

So, the problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

They give an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense. So, 81 is 9 squared, and in base 13, it's a two-digit number 63, whose digits add up to 9.

The task is to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the minimal base b where the number of b-eautiful integers exceeds ten.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what conditions define a b-eautiful number. 

So, n is a two-digit number in base b. That means in base 10, n can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and c must be less than b. So, a is at least 1, and both a and c are less than b.

The second condition is that the sum of the two digits a + c equals the square root of n. That is, a + c = sqrt(n). 

But wait, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = a*b + c. So, sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c. Let me write that equation down:

sqrt(a * b + c) = a + c.

If I square both sides, I get:

a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side, that's a² + 2ac + c². So:

a * b + c = a² + 2ac + c².

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for b. Subtract a*b from both sides:

c = a² + 2ac + c² - a*b.

Wait, that's not the most helpful. Maybe better to express b in terms of a and c.

Starting from the equation:

a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me subtract a*b from both sides:

c = (a + c)^2 - a*b.

Wait, maybe I can solve for b. Let's rearrange to get b.

Starting from a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Subtract c from both sides:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c.

Then, divide both sides by a:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a.

Hmm, that might be useful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write b as:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a.

Simplify that expression:

Let me compute (a + c)^2 - c:

(a + c)^2 = a² + 2ac + c².

So, (a + c)^2 - c = a² + 2ac + c² - c.

Then b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c) / a.

We can split this fraction:

b = (a²)/a + (2ac)/a + (c² - c)/a.

Simplify each term:

= a + 2c + (c² - c)/a.

Hmm, so for b to be an integer, (c² - c) must be divisible by a. Because a and c are digits, a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

Wait, but a and c are digits in base b, so a can be from 1 to b-1, and c can be from 0 to b-1.

So, since a divides (c² - c), we have that a divides c(c - 1). So, a must be a divisor of c(c - 1). 

That's an important point. So, for each a and c, we must have that a divides c(c - 1). 

Alternatively, since a and c are positive integers with a ≥1 and c ≥0, and a and c < b.

So, perhaps we can think of a as a divisor of c(c-1). But since a is at least 1, this is possible.

So, perhaps we can think in terms of a and c: for given a, c can be such that a divides c(c - 1). Or, for given c, a can be a divisor of c(c - 1).

Wait, but in our equation, b is expressed in terms of a and c as:

b = (a + c)^2 - c / a.

But since b must be an integer, ( (a + c)^2 - c ) must be divisible by a.

So, (a + c)^2 ≡ c mod a.

Wait, let's think about this modulus. Since (a + c)^2 mod a is equal to (c)^2 mod a, because a + c ≡ c mod a. So, (a + c)^2 ≡ c² mod a.

Then, (a + c)^2 - c ≡ c² - c mod a.

But for b to be integer, (a + c)^2 - c must be divisible by a. So, c² - c ≡ 0 mod a.

Therefore, a divides c(c - 1). So, that's the same conclusion as before.

So, a divides c(c - 1). So, a must be a divisor of c(c-1).

But since a and c are less than b, and a is at least 1, perhaps for each a, we can find possible c's such that a divides c(c-1).

Alternatively, for a given a, the possible c's are such that c ≡ 0 or 1 mod a. Because c(c - 1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so it's divisible by 2, but not necessarily by higher numbers. But in our case, it's c(c - 1) divisible by a, so c must be ≡ 0 mod a or c ≡1 mod a? Wait, no, that's if a is prime. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think of a and c as integers, so that a divides c(c - 1). So, c(c -1) must be a multiple of a.

So, for each a, the possible c's are those where c ≡ 0 mod a or c ≡ 1 mod a, but that's not necessarily the case for composite a. For example, if a is 4, then c could be 0,1,4,5, etc., but in the context of digits in base b, c must be less than b. So, for each a, c can take certain values.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this problem by considering the equation:

b = (a + c)^2 - c / a.

Which can be rewritten as:

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

So, for b to be integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

So, (c^2 - c) must be a multiple of a. So, for given a, c can be any integer such that c(c - 1) is divisible by a, and c < b, but since a is also less than b, and b is derived from a and c, perhaps we can model this as a function of a and c.

Wait, perhaps another way: Let's denote s = a + c, and we know that s = sqrt(n), and n = a*b + c. So, s^2 = a*b + c.

So, b = (s^2 - c)/a.

But since b must be an integer, (s^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

But since s = a + c, we can substitute:

b = ( (a + c)^2 - c ) / a.

So, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps we can think in terms of s. Let me let s be an integer such that s = a + c, and then n = s^2.

But n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 - 1. So, b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 - 1.

So, s^2 must be less than b^2, which implies that s < b.

But s is equal to a + c, and since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, s is at least 1, but since n is a two-digit number, n must be at least b, so s^2 ≥ b. So, s ≥ sqrt(b).

But s is less than b, as s^2 < b^2.

So, we have that sqrt(b) ≤ s < b.

But that's a bit vague. Let's think about specific values.

Wait, perhaps we can consider that for each s, we can find pairs (a, c) such that a + c = s, and a*b + c = s^2. Then, from that, we can solve for b:

b = (s^2 - c)/a.

But since a = s - c, substituting that in:

b = (s^2 - c)/(s - c).

Let me compute this:

b = (s^2 - c)/(s - c).

Hmm, that's a rational expression. Let's perform polynomial division or factor the numerator.

The numerator is s^2 - c, and the denominator is s - c.

So, s^2 - c = (s - c)(s + c) + (c^2 - c).

Wait, let me check:

(s - c)(s + c) = s^2 - c^2.

So, s^2 - c = (s^2 - c^2) + (c^2 - c) = (s - c)(s + c) + c(c - 1).

So, s^2 - c = (s - c)(s + c) + c(c - 1).

Therefore,

b = [ (s - c)(s + c) + c(c - 1) ] / (s - c )

= s + c + [ c(c - 1) / (s - c) ]

Since b must be integer, the term [ c(c - 1) / (s - c) ] must be integer.

Let me denote d = s - c. So, d = s - c.

Then, since s = a + c, and a = s - c = d.

So, a = d.

Wait, that's interesting: a = d = s - c.

So, substituting back:

b = s + c + [ c(c -1) / d ]

But d = a = s - c.

So, b = s + c + [ c(c -1) / a ].

Wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm, maybe I'm going in circles here.

Alternatively, since d = a, and a is a positive integer, we can write:

b = s + c + [ c(c -1) / a ].

But since a = d = s - c, let's substitute that:

b = s + c + [ c(c - 1) / (s - c) ].

So, for b to be integer, [ c(c - 1) ] must be divisible by (s - c).

But s = a + c, so s - c = a.

Therefore, as before, a must divide c(c - 1).

So, a must be a divisor of c(c - 1).

But since a is a digit in base b, a < b, and c < b.

So, for each a, the possible c's are such that c(c-1) is divisible by a, and c must satisfy c < b, but since b is expressed in terms of a and c, perhaps it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize in terms of a and c, and then find b accordingly.

So, for each a and c, with a ≥1, c ≥0, and a, c < b, we can compute b as:

b = (a + c)^2 - c / a.

But since a and c are less than b, we can express b as ( (a + c)^2 - c ) / a.

So, for given a and c, b must be greater than both a and c, since it's the base.

So, perhaps I can iterate over possible a and c, compute b, check if it's integer, and then count how many b-eautiful numbers exist for each base b.

But the problem is that we need to find the minimal b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers.

So, perhaps I can approach this by considering the equation:

n = a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

We can write this as:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Rearranged:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c.

So, as earlier:

b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a.

Which can be written as:

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

So, for b to be integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

So, a divides c(c - 1).

Therefore, for each a, we can find c such that c(c -1) is divisible by a.

But since a and c are digits in base b, we have 1 ≤ a < b, 0 ≤ c < b.

So, for each a, c can be 0 to b-1, but a must divide c(c -1).

But since a is part of the expression for b, perhaps it's better to fix a and c and compute b, then check if b is larger than both a and c.

Wait, but how can we structure this?

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of s = a + c, so s is equal to sqrt(n), and since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b² - 1.

So, n = s² must satisfy b ≤ s² ≤ b² - 1.

Taking square roots, sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ sqrt(b² - 1).

But sqrt(b² - 1) is just slightly less than b, so s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

Wait, actually, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b² - 1, inclusive.

Thus, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b² - 1). Since sqrt(b² - 1) is approximately b - 1/(2b).

So, s = sqrt(n) must be an integer, because a + c must be an integer, and s = a + c, which is integer.

Wait, because a and c are digits, so they are integers, so s must be integer.

So, the possible values of s are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b² - 1)).

But sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so the maximum integer s is b - 1.

So, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

But for each s, how many pairs (a, c) satisfy a + c = s, and a*b + c = s², with a < b and c < b.

Wait, perhaps for each s, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of valid pairs (a, c) such that a + c = s, a*b + c = s², and a, c < b.

But since n = s², and n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be at least b, so s² >= b => s >= sqrt(b).

And n must be less than b², so s² < b² => s < b.

So, s must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b - 1.

But for each s, we can solve for b.

From the equation a*b + c = s² and a + c = s.

We can express c = s - a.

Substituting into the first equation:

a*b + (s - a) = s².

So, a*b = s² - (s - a) = s² - s + a.

Then, a*b = s² - s + a.

Rearranged: a*b - a = s² - s.

So, a*(b - 1) = s*(s - 1).

Thus, b = [s*(s - 1)/a] + 1.

So, for each s, a must be a divisor of s*(s - 1). Because b must be an integer.

So, for each s, a must divide s*(s - 1), and a must be a positive integer less than b.

Wait, but a is a digit in base b, so a < b.

But since b = [s*(s -1)/a] + 1, and a < b, we have:

a < [s*(s -1)/a] + 1.

Multiply both sides by a:

a² < s*(s -1) + a.

So,

a² - a - s*(s -1) < 0.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

But perhaps, for each s, the number of possible a's is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s -1) that are less than b, which is s*(s -1)/a + 1.

Wait, but this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps for each s, the number of possible a's is equal to the number of positive divisors of s*(s -1), because a must divide s*(s -1).

But since a must be less than b, and b = [s*(s -1)/a] + 1, we have a < [s*(s -1)/a] + 1.

So, a^2 < s*(s -1) + a.

Which can be rewritten as a^2 - a - s*(s -1) < 0.

This is a quadratic inequality in a.

The quadratic equation a^2 - a - s*(s -1) = 0.

The roots are [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*s*(s -1))]/2.

Which simplifies to [1 ± sqrt(4s² - 4s +1)]/2.

sqrt(4s² -4s +1) = sqrt( (2s -1)^2 ) = 2s -1.

So, the roots are [1 ± (2s -1)]/2.

Taking the positive root, since a is positive:

[1 + (2s -1)]/2 = (2s)/2 = s.

And the other root is [1 - (2s -1)]/2 = (2 - 2s)/2 = 1 - s, which is negative.

So, the inequality a^2 - a - s*(s -1) < 0 holds for a between the two roots, i.e., a < s.

But since a is a positive integer, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a < s.

But also, a must divide s*(s -1).

So, for each s, the possible a's are the divisors of s*(s -1) that are less than s.

Wait, but s*(s -1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so it's even, and it's equal to s² -s.

The number of divisors a of s*(s -1) with a < s.

So, for each s, the number of such a's is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s -1) that are less than s.

But the number of such divisors is equal to the number of divisors d of s*(s -1) with d < s.

But s and s-1 are coprime, since they are consecutive integers.

So, s and s-1 are coprime, so the number of divisors of s*(s -1) less than s is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s -1) that are less than s.

Alternatively, since s and s-1 are coprime, the number of divisors less than s is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s -1) that are less than s.

But perhaps it's easier to note that for each divisor d of s*(s -1), if d < s, then the corresponding co-divisor is (s*(s -1))/d, which is greater than s.

So, for each s, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors d of s*(s -1) with d < s.

Thus, the number of possible a's for each s is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s -1) less than s.

Therefore, for each s, the number of possible a's is equal to the number of such divisors.

So, the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given base b is the number of pairs (s, a) such that:

1. s is an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1.

2. a divides s*(s -1).

3. a < s.

But since b = [s*(s -1)/a] +1, for each pair (s, a), we can compute b.

So, perhaps the approach is:

For each s, compute the number of a's that are divisors of s*(s-1) and less than s.

Each such a gives a base b = [s*(s -1)/a] + 1.

But for each b, we can count how many s's and a's correspond to it, and thus the number of b-eautiful numbers.

So, to find the minimal b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten, we can iterate over possible s's, find the corresponding a's and b's, and count how many times each b occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the number of b-eautiful numbers as the number of solutions (s,a) for that b.

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe a better approach is to realize that for each s, the number of possible a's is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s-1) less than s. So, for each s, the number of a's is equal to the number of such divisors.

Since s and s-1 are coprime, the number of divisors of s*(s-1) less than s is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s-1) that do not divide s.

Wait, not exactly. Because s*(s-1) has (number of divisors of s) * (number of divisors of s-1) since they're coprime.

But the total number of divisors is d(s) * d(s-1). But the number of divisors less than s is equal to the number of divisors d of s*(s-1) such that d < s.

But because s and s-1 are coprime, any divisor less than s must be a divisor of s-1 or a divisor of s that is less than s.

Wait, no. Because s and s-1 are coprime, any divisor d of s*(s-1) can be expressed as d1*d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1.

So, for d < s, either d1=1 or d2=1, but not necessarily.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: s and s-1 are coprime, so any divisor d of s*(s-1) can be written uniquely as d = d1*d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1.

So, the condition d < s is equivalent to d1*d2 < s.

But s = d1*d2 + (s - d1*d2). Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps to note that for d < s, either d2=1, so d = d1, which divides s, and d1 < s.

Or d1=1, so d = d2, which divides s-1, but d2 can be up to s-1.

Wait, if d2 = s-1, then d = s-1, which is less than s.

So, the number of divisors d of s*(s-1) less than s is equal to (number of divisors of s) + (number of divisors of s-1) - 1.

Wait, why minus 1? Because 1 is a common divisor, counted in both.

Wait, no, because when we write d as d1*d2, with d1 | s and d2 | s-1, the only overlapping divisor is 1*1=1. So, the total number of divisors less than s would be (number of divisors of s) + (number of divisors of s-1) - 1.

Wait, let me test with an example.

Take s=4.

s=4, s-1=3.

Divisors of 4 are 1,2,4.

Divisors of 3 are 1,3.

So, the divisors of 4*3=12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12.

Divisors less than 4: 1,2,3.

Which are 3 in number.

Number of divisors of s=4: 3 (1,2,4).

Number of divisors of s-1=3: 2 (1,3).

So, 3 + 2 -1 =4, but we have only 3 divisors less than 4.

Hmm, so the formula doesn't hold here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think.

Each divisor d of s*(s-1) less than s can be written as d = d1*d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1, and d1*d2 < s.

But s and s-1 are coprime, so d1 and d2 are coprime.

So, the condition is d1*d2 < s.

But s = d1*d2 + something.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such d's is equal to the number of pairs (d1, d2) where d1 divides s, d2 divides s-1, and d1*d2 < s.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps for each s, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s-1) less than s, which is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s-1) that are less than s.

But since s and s-1 are coprime, the number of such divisors is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s-1) less than s, which can be expressed as:

tau(s*(s-1)) / 2 if s is not a perfect square, else (tau(s*(s-1)) + 1)/2.

Wait, because the number of divisors less than sqrt(n) is equal to the number of divisors greater than sqrt(n). If n is not a perfect square.

But in our case, n = s*(s-1), which is not a perfect square since s and s-1 are coprime and consecutive.

So, the number of divisors less than sqrt(s*(s-1)) is equal to the number of divisors greater than sqrt(s*(s-1)).

But since sqrt(s*(s-1)) is approximately s - 0.5, because s*(s-1) = s² -s.

So, sqrt(s² -s) ≈ s - 1/(2s).

So, the number of divisors less than s is equal to the number of divisors greater than s.

But the total number of divisors is tau(s*(s-1)).

So, if tau(s*(s-1)) is even, then the number of divisors less than s is tau(s*(s-1))/2.

If tau(s*(s-1)) is odd, then it's (tau(s*(s-1)) - 1)/2.

But since s and s-1 are coprime, tau(s*(s-1)) = tau(s) * tau(s-1).

So, the number of divisors less than s is:

If tau(s) * tau(s-1) is even: (tau(s)*tau(s-1))/2.

Else: (tau(s)*tau(s-1) - 1)/2.

But wait, this might not always hold because some divisors could be equal to s, but since s and s-1 are coprime, the only way d = s is if d1 = s and d2 =1, but s is a divisor of s, so d = s is a divisor.

So, in that case, the number of divisors less than s is equal to (tau(s*(s-1)) -1)/2 because we exclude the divisor s itself.

Wait, for example, take s=4.

s=4, s-1=3.

tau(4)=3, tau(3)=2, so tau(12)=6.

Number of divisors less than 4: 1,2,3 => 3.

(6 -1)/2 = 2.5, which is not 3. So, that approach doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps this line of reasoning isn't the best.

Maybe it's better to consider that for each s, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors of s*(s-1) that are less than s.

So, for each s, the number of such a's is the number of divisors d of s*(s-1) with d < s.

But how can we compute that?

Alternatively, perhaps for each s, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors of s-1 plus the number of divisors of s that are less than s, minus 1 (for the divisor 1).

Wait, let me test this with s=4.

s=4, s-1=3.

Divisors of s=4: 1,2,4.

Divisors of s-1=3: 1,3.

Number of divisors of s less than s: 2 (1,2).

Number of divisors of s-1 less than s: 2 (1,3).

But total number of a's is 3 (1,2,3). So, 2 + 2 -1=3. That works.

Another example: s=5.

s=5, s-1=4.

Divisors of s=5:1,5.

Divisors of s-1=4:1,2,4.

Number of divisors of s less than s:1 (1).

Number of divisors of s-1 less than s:2 (1,2,4) → but 4 <5, so 3 divisors.

Wait, but according to the formula, it would be 1 +3 -1=3.

But the actual number of a's is the number of divisors of 5*4=20 less than 5.

Divisors of 20:1,2,4,5,10,20.

Divisors less than 5:1,2,4 → 3. So, yes, the formula holds.

So, the number of a's for each s is equal to:

(number of divisors of s less than s) + (number of divisors of s-1 less than s) -1.

But the number of divisors of s less than s is equal to tau(s) -1 (excluding s itself).

Similarly, the number of divisors of s-1 less than s is equal to tau(s-1), because all divisors of s-1 are less than s, since s-1 < s.

Wait, no, that's not correct because s-1 can be equal to s if s=2, but generally, s-1 < s.

So, the number of divisors of s-1 is tau(s-1), and all of them are less than s, except perhaps if s-1 is 1, but s is at least 2.

Wait, for s=2, s-1=1, which has tau(1)=1, and divisors are just 1, which is less than 2.

So, for general s ≥2, the number of divisors of s-1 less than s is equal to tau(s-1).

Similarly, the number of divisors of s less than s is equal to tau(s) -1.

So, the number of a's for each s is:

[tau(s) -1] + tau(s-1) -1 = tau(s) + tau(s-1) -2.

Wait, in the earlier example, s=4:

tau(4)=3, tau(3)=2.

So, 3 +2 -2=3. Which matches.

s=5:

tau(5)=2, tau(4)=3.

2 +3 -2=3. Which matches.

Another example: s=3.

tau(3)=2, tau(2)=2.

Number of a's: 2 +2 -2=2.

Which is correct because s=3, s*(s-1)=6.

Divisors of 6 less than 3:1,2 → 2.

Yes, correct.

So, the formula is:

For each s, the number of a's is tau(s) + tau(s-1) -2.

Therefore, for each s, the number of b-eautiful numbers is tau(s) + tau(s-1) -2.

But wait, each a gives a different b.

Wait, no. Each a gives a different pair (a, c), which might correspond to different bases b.

Wait, perhaps not. For each s, each a gives a different b, but different s's can lead to the same b.

So, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is the sum over s of the number of a's for each s, but only considering those s's that lead to the same b.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (s, a) such that b = [s*(s-1)/a] +1, with a dividing s*(s-1), and a < s.

But this seems recursive.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for each s, the number of possible a's is tau(s) + tau(s-1) -2, and each a gives a unique b.

But then, for each s, we get tau(s) + tau(s-1) -2 different b's, each corresponding to a different a.

But we need to find the minimal b such that the number of such pairs (s, a) for that b is more than ten.

Wait, but if for each s, we have a certain number of a's, each giving a different b, then to find the minimal b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers, perhaps we can find the minimal b that is generated from multiple s's and a's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this by first considering that for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of solutions (a, c) such that:

1. n = a*b + c is a two-digit number in base b, so 1 ≤ a < b, 0 ≤ c < b.

2. a + c = sqrt(n).

But n = (a + c)^2, so n = s^2 where s = a + c.

So, s^2 = a*b + c.

But since c = s - a, substitution gives s^2 = a*b + s -a.

Rearranged:

s^2 - s = a*(b -1).

So, a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1).

But since a must be an integer, b -1 must divide s(s -1).

So, for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s such that:

1. s ≥ ceil(sqrt(b)).

2. s ≤ b -1.

3. b -1 divides s(s -1).

4. a = (s^2 -s)/(b -1) is an integer, and 1 ≤ a < b.

So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that b -1 divides s(s -1), and a = (s^2 -s)/(b -1) is an integer between 1 and b -1.

So, to find the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we can:

1. Compute d = b -1.

2. Find the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that d divides s(s -1), and a = s(s -1)/d is an integer between 1 and b -1.

So, the number of such s's is equal to the number of b-eautiful numbers.

Therefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that d divides s(s -1), and 1 ≤ s(s -1)/d < b.

But since d = b -1, and s ≤ b -1, s(s -1)/d = s(s -1)/(b -1).

We need this to be an integer and less than b.

But since s ≤ b -1, s(s -1) ≤ (b -1)(b -2).

So, s(s -1)/(b -1) ≤ (b -1)(b -2)/(b -1) = b -2 < b.

So, the upper condition is automatically satisfied.

So, the main condition is that d = b -1 divides s(s -1).

Therefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that d divides s(s -1).

So, for each b, compute d = b -1, then count the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that d divides s(s -1).

So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal b such that the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] with d divides s(s -1) is greater than ten.

Thus, we can approach this by iterating b starting from 2 upwards, compute d = b -1, find the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that d divides s(s -1), and check when this count exceeds ten.

But this seems computationally intensive, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula for the number of s's.

Given that d = b -1, the problem is to find the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), d] such that d divides s(s -1).

But d = b -1, so s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to d.

So, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), d] such that d divides s(s -1).

But d divides s(s -1), so s(s -1) ≡0 mod d.

Which implies that s ≡0 mod d or s ≡1 mod d.

Wait, because if d divides s(s -1), then either d divides s or d divides s -1.

But since s ≤ d, because s ≤ b -1 = d.

So, s can be either 0 mod d or 1 mod d.

But s is at least ceil(sqrt(b)).

So, s can be 0 mod d or 1 mod d within the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), d].

But s=0 mod d would imply s=d, since s ≤d.

Similarly, s=1 mod d implies s=1, but s must be ≥ ceil(sqrt(b)).

So, let's consider:

Case 1: s ≡0 mod d.

Then s=d, since s ≤d.

So, s=d.

But d = b -1.

So, s=d = b -1.

Thus, s must be equal to d.

Case 2: s ≡1 mod d.

Then s=1 + k*d, for some integer k ≥0.

But since s ≤d, the only possibility is k=0, so s=1.

But s must be ≥ ceil(sqrt(b)).

So, unless ceil(sqrt(b)) ≤1, which only happens when b=1 or 2.

But b ≥2, so ceil(sqrt(2))=2.

Thus, s=1 is only possible when sqrt(b) ≤1, which is not the case for b≥2.

Therefore, the only possible s in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), d] that satisfy s(s -1) ≡0 mod d are s=d and s=1, but s=1 is only sometimes in the range.

Wait, but for b ≥2:

- s=1: only if ceil(sqrt(b)) ≤1, which is when b=1 or 2.

But b≥2, so sqrt(2)≈1.414, so ceil(sqrt(2))=2.

So, s=1 is less than 2, so it's not in the range [2, d].

Therefore, the only s in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), d] that satisfy d divides s(s -1) is s=d.

But wait, that can't be right because in the earlier example, b=13:

s=9, because n=81=9².

d = 13 -1=12.

So, check if 12 divides s(s -1)=9*8=72.

72 divided by 12 is 6, which is integer. So, yes.

So, s=9 is another solution besides s=12.

Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, s=12 would be s=d, which is 12.

So, s=12 is another solution.

But in the example, s=9 is also a solution.

Hmm, so our earlier conclusion that only s=d and s=1 satisfy s(s -1) ≡0 mod d is incorrect.

So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, s(s -1) ≡0 mod d, which is equivalent to s ≡0 mod d or s ≡1 mod d, but since s ≤d, s can be either 0 or 1 mod d.

But s=0 mod d is s=d, and s=1 mod d is s=1.

But in the example with b=13, d=12.

s=9:

9 ≡9 mod12, which is not 0 or 1.

But 9*8=72, which is 6*12, so 12 divides 72.

So, that's another solution.

Therefore, our earlier conclusion that s must be 0 or 1 mod d is incorrect.

So, perhaps the condition is that d divides s(s -1), but not necessarily that s ≡0 or 1 mod d.

Wait, but for d to divide s(s -1), it's necessary that the prime factors of d are present in s or s-1.

So, for example, if d is composite, it's possible that s and s-1 share factors with d.

But since s and s-1 are coprime, any prime factor of d must divide either s or s-1, but not both.

Therefore, the condition is that for each prime power in the factorization of d, it must divide either s or s-1.

So, for d to divide s(s -1), s must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo each prime power in the factorization of d.

But since s and s-1 are coprime, each prime power must divide exactly one of s or s-1.

Thus, the number of solutions s in [1, d] is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But in our case, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), d].

So, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), d] such that for each prime power in d, s ≡0 or 1 modulo that prime power.

But since s and s-1 must cover all the prime factors of d, the number of solutions is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But in our earlier example, d=12.

Prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3.

So, k=2, so number of solutions is 4.

But in our example, s=9 is a solution, s=1 is a solution, s=4 (since 4 ≡1 mod3 and 4≡0 mod4?), wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the solutions are s ≡0 or 1 mod4, and s≡0 or1 mod3.

So, the possible s's are the combinations:

s ≡0 mod4 and s≡0 mod3 → s≡0 mod12.

s ≡0 mod4 and s≡1 mod3 → s≡4 mod12.

s ≡1 mod4 and s≡0 mod3 → s≡9 mod12.

s ≡1 mod4 and s≡1 mod3 → s≡1 mod12.

So, the solutions are s=1,4,9,12 in the range [1,12].

In our earlier example, s=9 and s=12 are in the range [ceil(sqrt(13))=4,12].

So, s=4,9,12.

Wait, s=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 12.

Yes, 12 divides 12.

So, s=4 is also a solution.

So, in this case, the number of s's is 3: s=4,9,12.

But according to the earlier calculation, the number of solutions is 4, but one of them is s=1, which is below the lower bound of 4.

So, the number of s's in the required range is 3.

So, for d=12, the number of s's in [4,12] that satisfy d divides s(s -1) is 3.

So, for b=13, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 3.

But in the example, n=81 is one, but are there others?

Wait, let's check.

For s=4:

s=4, d=12.

a = (4*3)/12 = 12/12=1.

So, a=1, c= s -a=3.

So, n= a*b +c=1*13 +3=16.

Which is 4²=16.

So, 16 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 16 is written as 13 + 3, which is 1*13 +3, digits 1 and 3, which sum to 4=sqrt(16).

So, yes, 16 is another 13-eautiful number.

Similarly, s=12:

a=(12*11)/12=11.

c=12-11=1.

n=11*13 +1=143 +1=144, which is 12².

So, 144 is 13-eautiful as well.

So, for b=13, there are three b-eautiful numbers: 16, 81, 144.

So, the count is 3.

But earlier, when we thought of the number of solutions as 2^k, where k is the number of prime factors, we get 4 solutions, but only 3 are in the required range.

So, the number of b-eautiful numbers for b=13 is 3.

So, to find the minimal b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need to find the smallest b where the number of s's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s -1) is greater than ten.

Given that, perhaps we can find that for b where d = b-1 has many small prime factors, the number of solutions s increases.

Because the number of solutions s is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But in the case where d has multiple prime factors, each additional prime factor doubles the number of solutions.

Wait, for example, if d has k distinct prime factors, then the number of solutions s in [1, d] is 2^k.

But in our earlier example, d=12=2^2*3, so k=2, so 4 solutions.

But in the range [4,12], we have 3 solutions.

So, perhaps the number of solutions in the required range is approximately 2^{k}.

But to have more than ten solutions, we need 2^k >10.

So, k needs to be at least 4, since 2^4=16>10.

Thus, d=b-1 needs to have at least four distinct prime factors.

But wait, 2^4=16, but in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), d], the number of solutions might be less than 16.

But perhaps for d with multiple prime factors, the number of solutions in the required range increases.

So, perhaps the minimal b is when d=b-1 has four distinct prime factors, leading to 16 solutions, but some of them might be below ceil(sqrt(b)).

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a b where d has several small exponents, leading to more solutions.

But this is getting a bit too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of d that are greater than or equal to ceil(sqrt(b)) and less than or equal to d.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using inclusion-exclusion, the number of s in [1, d] such that d divides s(s -1) is equal to the number of s in [1, d] where s ≡0 mod p or s≡1 mod p for each prime p dividing d.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the number of solutions s is equal to the number of s in [1, d] such that s ≡0 or1 mod each prime power in d.

But since s and s-1 are coprime, each prime power must divide either s or s-1.

So, the number of solutions s is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But in our example, d=12=2^2*3, so k=2, so 4 solutions.

But only 3 are in the range [4,12].

So, perhaps the number of solutions in the required range is roughly 2^{k}.

Therefore, to have more than ten solutions, we need 2^{k} >10.

Thus, k needs to be at least 4, since 2^4=16>10.

So, d needs to have at least four distinct prime factors.

But wait, d=b-1.

So, b = d +1.

So, to find the minimal b, we need the minimal d with at least four distinct prime factors, such that the number of s's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), d] is greater than ten.

But the minimal d with four distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210.

So, d=210, b=211.

But is 2^4=16 solutions, but how many of them are in the range [ceil(sqrt(211)), 210].

sqrt(211)≈14.52, so s ranges from15 to210.

But for d=210, the number of solutions s is 2^4=16.

But how many of these 16 are ≥15?

Each solution s is of the form s=1 or s=d, or s= product of combinations of prime factors.

Wait, perhaps not. Since s must satisfy s ≡0 or1 mod each prime factor.

So, for d=210=2*3*5*7.

The solutions are s≡0 or1 mod2, s≡0 or1 mod3, s≡0 or1 mod5, s≡0 or1 mod7.

So, each combination gives a unique solution modulo 210.

So, there are 2^4=16 solutions modulo 210.

Therefore, in the range [1,210], there are 16 solutions.

But we need s ≥15.

So, the number of solutions in [15,210] is 16 minus the number of solutions less than 15.

So, how many solutions are less than 15?

The solutions less than 15 are s=1, s=2, s=3, s=4, s=5, s=6, s=7, s=8, s=9, s=10, s=11, s=12, s=13, s=14.

But wait, not all of these are solutions.

Wait, the solutions are s such that s≡0 or1 mod2,3,5,7.

So, the solutions are numbers where for each prime p in {2,3,5,7}, s≡0 or1 mod p.

So, the minimal solutions are s=1, s=2, s=3, s=4, s=5, s=6, s=7, s=8, s=9, s=10, s=11, s=12, s=13, s=14, s=15, etc.

Wait, but s=1: yes.

s=2: yes, since 2≡0 mod2 and 2≡2 mod3, which is not 0 or1, so no.

Wait, no, because for s=2:

s=2 must satisfy s≡0 or1 mod2,3,5,7.

s=2≡0 mod2, which is okay.

s=2≡2 mod3, which is not 0 or1, so s=2 is not a solution.

Wait, so the solutions are numbers s where for each prime p in {2,3,5,7}, s≡0 or1 mod p.

So, s must satisfy s≡0 or1 mod2, s≡0 or1 mod3, s≡0 or1 mod5, s≡0 or1 mod7.

Thus, s can be written as s ≡ a mod2, s≡b mod3, s≡c mod5, s≡d mod7, where a,b,c,d ∈{0,1}.

So, the number of solutions is 16, each corresponding to a combination of a,b,c,d.

Thus, each solution is a unique residue modulo 210.

So, in the range [1,210], there are 16 solutions.

But how many of these are ≥15?

Well, s=1 is less than 15, s= other solutions?

Wait, let's list the solutions.

But this is time-consuming, but perhaps we can note that the minimal solution greater than or equal to15 is s=15.

Because s=15≡0 mod3,5; but 15≡1 mod2 (since 15 is odd), and 15≡1 mod7? 15 mod7=1.

Yes, 15≡1 mod7.

So, s=15 is a solution.

Similarly, s=21 is a solution?

s=21≡1 mod2? 21 is odd, yes.

s=21≡0 mod3, yes.

s=21≡1 mod5? 21 mod5=1, yes.

s=21≡0 mod7, yes.

So, s=21 is a solution.

Similarly, s=22:

22≡0 mod2.

22≡1 mod3 (22 mod3=1).

22≡2 mod5→ not 0 or1, so no.

So, s=22 is not a solution.

Similarly, s=23:

23≡1 mod2.

23≡2 mod3→ not 0 or1, so no.

So, s=23 is not a solution.

s=24:

24≡0 mod2.

24≡0 mod3.

24≡4 mod5→ not 0 or1.

So, no.

s=25:

25≡1 mod2.

25≡1 mod3 (25 mod3=1).

25≡0 mod5.

25≡4 mod7→ no.

So, not a solution.

s=26:

26≡0 mod2.

26≡2 mod3→ no.

So, no.

s=27:

27≡1 mod2.

27≡0 mod3.

27≡2 mod5→ no.

s=28:

28≡0 mod2.

28≡1 mod3 (28 mod3=1).

28≡3 mod5→ no.

s=29:

29≡1 mod2.

29≡2 mod3→ no.

s=30:

30≡0 mod2.

30≡0 mod3.

30≡0 mod5.

30≡2 mod7→ no.

s=31:

31≡1 mod2.

31≡1 mod3.

31≡1 mod5.

31≡3 mod7→ no.

s=32:

32≡0 mod2.

32≡2 mod3→ no.

s=33:

33≡1 mod2.

33≡0 mod3.

33≡3 mod5→ no.

s=34:

34≡0 mod2.

34≡1 mod3.

34≡4 mod5→ no.

s=35:

35≡1 mod2.

35≡2 mod3→ no.

s=36:

36≡0 mod2.

36≡0 mod3.

36≡1 mod5.

36≡1 mod7.

So, s=36 is a solution.

So, s=36 is a solution.

So, in the range [15,210], we have several solutions:15,21,36, etc.

But to count exactly how many, it's tedious.

But assuming that for d=210, the number of solutions s in [15,210] is around 15, which is more than ten.

But is 211 the minimal b?

Wait, perhaps a smaller d with multiple prime factors can give more than ten solutions.

Wait, for example, d=120=2^3*3*5, which has three distinct prime factors, so 2^3=8 solutions.

But in the range [ceil(sqrt(121))=11,120], we might have more than ten solutions.

Wait, but 8 solutions is less than ten.

So, perhaps we need a d with more prime factors.

Wait, let's consider d=30=2*3*5, which has 3 distinct prime factors.

Number of solutions s is 8.

But in the range [6,30], how many solutions are there?

s=1, which is less than 6.

s=2: no.

s=3: yes.

s=4: no.

s=5: yes.

s=6: yes.

s=7: no.

s=8: no.

s=9: yes.

s=10: yes.

s=11: no.

s=12: yes.

s=13: no.

s=14: no.

s=15: yes.

s=16: no.

s=17: no.

s=18: yes.

s=19: no.

s=20: yes.

s=21: yes.

s=22: no.

s=23: no.

s=24: yes.

s=25: yes.

s=26: no.

s=27: yes.

s=28: no.

s=29: no.

s=30: yes.

So, in the range [6,30], the solutions are s=6,9,10,12,15,18,20,21,24,25,27,30.

That's 12 solutions.

So, for d=30, b=31, the number of solutions is 12 in the range [6,30].

So, for b=31, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 12, which is more than ten.

But is 31 the minimal b?

Wait, let's check for smaller d's.

Wait, let's try d=24=2^3*3.

Number of distinct prime factors k=2, so 4 solutions.

But in the range [5,24], how many solutions are there.

s=1: no.

s=2: no.

s=3: yes.

s=4: yes.

s=5: no.

s=6: yes.

s=7: no.

s=8: yes.

s=9: yes.

s=10: no.

s=11: no.

s=12: yes.

s=13: no.

s=14: no.

s=15: yes.

s=16: no.

s=17: no.

s=18: yes.

s=19: no.

s=20: yes.

s=21: yes.

s=22: no.

s=23: no.

s=24: yes.

So, in the range [5,24], the solutions are s=3,4,6,8,9,12,15,18,20,21,24.

That's 11 solutions.

So, for d=24, b=25, the number of solutions is 11, which is just over ten.

But wait, is 11 the count?

Wait, let's recount:

s=3: yes.

s=4: yes.

s=6: yes.

s=8: yes.

s=9: yes.

s=12: yes.

s=15: yes.

s=18: yes.

s=20: yes.

s=21: yes.

s=24: yes.

That's 11 solutions.

So, for b=25, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 11, which is more than ten.

But is 25 the minimal b?

Wait, let's check for d=24, b=25.

Yes, the count is 11.

But let's check for smaller d's.

For example, d=12, b=13.

We saw that the number of solutions is 3.

d=20=2^2*5.

Number of prime factors=2, so 4 solutions.

In the range [5,20], how many?

s=1: no.

s=2: no.

s=3: no.

s=4: yes.

s=5: yes.

s=6: yes.

s=7: no.

s=8: yes.

s=9: no.

s=10: yes.

s=11: no.

s=12: yes.

s=13: no.

s=14: no.

s=15: yes.

s=16: yes.

s=17: no.

s=18: yes.

s=19: no.

s=20: yes.

So, solutions are s=4,5,6,8,10,12,15,16,18,20.

That's 10 solutions.

So, for d=20, b=21, the number of solutions is 10, which is exactly ten.

But the problem asks for more than ten, so b=21 is not sufficient.

Next, d=24, b=25, which gives 11 solutions.

So, is 25 the minimal b?

Wait, let's check d=18=2*3^2.

Number of prime factors=2, so 4 solutions.

In the range [5,18], let's see:

s=1: no.

s=2: no.

s=3: yes.

s=4: yes.

s=5: no.

s=6: yes.

s=7: no.

s=8: yes.

s=9: yes.

s=10: no.

s=11: no.

s=12: yes.

s=13: no.

s=14: no.

s=15: yes.

s=16: no.

s=17: no.

s=18: yes.

So, solutions are s=3,4,6,8,9,12,15,18.

That's 8 solutions, which is less than ten.

So, b=19 has 8 solutions.

Thus, the minimal b where the number of solutions exceeds ten is b=25.

But wait, earlier, for d=24, b=25, we have 11 solutions.

But is there a smaller b where d has three prime factors, leading to 8 solutions, but in a smaller range?

Wait, for d=30, b=31, we have 12 solutions.

But 25 is smaller than 31, so 25 is better.

But let's check d=16=2^4.

Number of prime factors=1, so 2 solutions.

In the range [5,16], how many?

s=1: no.

s=2: no.

s=3: no.

s=4: yes.

s=5: no.

s=6: no.

s=7: no.

s=8: yes.

s=9: no.

s=10: no.

s=11: no.

s=12: yes.

s=13: no.

s=14: no.

s=15: yes.

s=16: yes.

So, solutions are s=4,8,12,15,16.

That's 5 solutions, which is less than ten.

So, b=17 has 5 solutions.

Thus, the minimal b is 25.

But wait, earlier, for d=24, b=25, the number of solutions is 11.

But let's verify this.

For d=24, which is 2^3*3.

So, the number of solutions s in [5,24] is 11.

So, for each s in [5,24], s must satisfy s≡0 or1 mod2 and s≡0 or1 mod3.

So, the solutions are:

s=5: 5≡1 mod2, 5≡2 mod3→ no.

s=6: 6≡0 mod2, 6≡0 mod3→ yes.

s=7:7≡1 mod2,7≡1 mod3→ yes.

s=8:8≡0 mod2,8≡2 mod3→ no.

s=9:9≡1 mod2,9≡0 mod3→ yes.

s=10:10≡0 mod2,10≡1 mod3→ yes.

s=11:11≡1 mod2,11≡2 mod3→ no.

s=12:12≡0 mod2,12≡0 mod3→ yes.

s=13:13≡1 mod2,13≡1 mod3→ yes.

s=14:14≡0 mod2,14≡2 mod3→ no.

s=15:15≡1 mod2,15≡0 mod3→ yes.

s=16:16≡0 mod2,16≡1 mod3→ yes.

s=17:17≡1 mod2,17≡2 mod3→ no.

s=18:18≡0 mod2,18≡0 mod3→ yes.

s=19:19≡1 mod2,19≡1 mod3→ yes.

s=20:20≡0 mod2,20≡2 mod3→ no.

s=21:21≡1 mod2,21≡0 mod3→ yes.

s=22:22≡0 mod2,22≡1 mod3→ yes.

s=23:23≡1 mod2,23≡2 mod3→ no.

s=24:24≡0 mod2,24≡0 mod3→ yes.

So, the solutions in [5,24] are:

6,7,9,10,12,13,15,16,18,19,21,22,24.

Wait, that's 13 solutions.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 11, but recounting, it's 13.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.

So, s=6,7,9,10,12,13,15,16,18,19,21,22,24.

That's 13 solutions.

So, for d=24, b=25, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 13, which is more than ten.

But is there a smaller b where the number of solutions exceeds ten?

Let's check d=18=2*3^2.

Number of solutions s in [5,18] is 8, as before.

d=20=2^2*5.

Number of solutions s in [5,20] is 10, as before.

So, the next candidate is d=24, b=25, with 13 solutions.

But wait, let's check d=16=2^4.

As before, only 5 solutions.

d=12=2^2*3.

Number of solutions s in [4,12] is 3.

So, the minimal b where the number of solutions exceeds ten is b=25.

But wait, let's check d=28=2^2*7.

Number of prime factors=2, so 4 solutions.

In the range [6,28], how many solutions are there?

s=6: yes.

s=7: yes.

s=8: no.

s=9: yes.

s=10: yes.

s=11: no.

s=12: yes.

s=13: no.

s=14: yes.

s=15: yes.

s=16: no.

s=17: no.

s=18: yes.

s=19: no.

s=20: yes.

s=21: yes.

s=22: no.

s=23: no.

s=24: yes.

s=25: yes.

s=26: no.

s=27: yes.

s=28: yes.

So, solutions are s=6,7,9,10,12,14,15,18,20,21,24,25,27,28.

That's 14 solutions.

So, for d=28, b=29, the number of solutions is 14.

But 25 is smaller than 29, so 25 is better.

Wait, but earlier, for d=24, b=25, we have 13 solutions.

Is there a smaller b?

Wait, let's try d=20=2^2*5.

Number of solutions s in [5,20] is 10.

So, exactly ten, which is not more than ten.

Thus, the minimal b is 25.

But wait, let's check d=18=2*3^2.

Number of solutions s in [5,18] is 8.

d=24=2^3*3.

Number of solutions s in [5,24] is 13.

Thus, the minimal b is 25.

But wait, let's check d=12=2^2*3.

Number of solutions s in [4,12] is 3.

d=16=2^4.

Number of solutions s in [5,16] is 5.

d=18=2*3^2.

Number of solutions s in [5,18] is 8.

d=20=2^2*5.

Number of solutions s in [5,20] is 10.

d=24=2^3*3.

Number of solutions s in [5,24] is 13.

Thus, the minimal b where the number of solutions exceeds ten is b=25.

So, the answer is 25.


To determine the minimal base \( b \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers, we analyze the conditions under which a number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). 

Expressing \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( n = a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \), we derive the equation:
\[
\sqrt{a \cdot b + c} = a + c
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
a \cdot b + c = (a + c)^2
\]
Rearranging:
\[
a \cdot b = (a + c)^2 - c
\]
Thus:
\[
b = \frac{(a + c)^2 - c}{a}
\]
For \( b \) to be an integer, \( a \) must divide \( (a + c)^2 - c \). This leads to the conclusion that \( a \) must divide \( c(c - 1) \).

To find the minimal \( b \) with more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers, we consider the number of valid pairs \( (a, c) \) for each \( b \). The number of such pairs corresponds to the number of divisors of \( b - 1 \) that satisfy specific modular conditions. 

By analyzing bases \( b \) and their corresponding \( b - 1 \) values, we find that when \( b = 25 \), the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers exceeds ten. This is because \( b - 1 = 24 \) has multiple divisors, leading to numerous valid pairs \( (a, c) \).

Thus, the minimal base \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers is:

\boxed{25}
