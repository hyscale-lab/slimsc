Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting problem. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles in a regular polygon is ((n-2)*180)/n, so ((12-2)*180)/12 = 150 degrees. That might not be directly relevant, but it's good to know.

Now, the question is about rectangles formed by the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle must align with either the edges of the dodecagon or the diagonals. I'm picturing a dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon, so it's quite a complex shape. It's symmetric, so maybe I can use some combinatorial approach here.

I think rectangles can be formed by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if the number of sides between them is the same. For example, in a regular hexagon, sides are parallel if they are opposite each other. Similarly, in a dodecagon, sides can be parallel if they are separated by a certain number of vertices.

Wait, so maybe the idea is to find pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) and then find how many rectangles can be formed by these pairs. Since a rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides, each pair perpendicular to the other.

But wait, in a regular polygon, the concept of perpendicularity isn't straightforward. Because the sides and diagonals aren't necessarily at right angles unless the polygon has an even number of sides and certain conditions are met.

Wait, let's think about the angles between sides and diagonals in a regular dodecagon. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, each side subtends 30 degrees at the center.

If I can find lines that are perpendicular in terms of their central angles, that would help form rectangles. Because for a rectangle, adjacent sides must be perpendicular.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, two lines can be perpendicular if the angle between them is 90 degrees. Since each central angle is 30 degrees, how many steps between vertices would give a 90-degree angle?

Well, let's see, 30 degrees per step. So, 90/30 = 3 steps. So, lines that are three steps apart would form a 90-degree angle? Hmm, is that correct?

Let me visualize. If I have a vertex at 0 degrees, then the next is at 30, then 60, 90, etc. So, the line from 0 to 3 is at 90 degrees. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps to find lines that
