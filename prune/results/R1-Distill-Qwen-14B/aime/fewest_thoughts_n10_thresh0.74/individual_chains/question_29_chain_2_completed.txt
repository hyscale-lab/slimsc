Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. Hmm, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The lengths given are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me try to visualize this. Rectangles ABCD and EFGH. So, ABCD has sides AB=107 and BC=16, so that's a tall and narrow rectangle. EFGH is another rectangle, with FG=17 and EF=184. Wait, EF is a side of 184, which is much longer than AB. So EFGH is a wide and short rectangle.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are on a circle, which suggests that these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Let me try to sketch the figure mentally. Let's consider rectangle ABCD: points A, B, C, D in order. So, AB is 107, BC is 16, so CD is 107, DA is 16. Rectangle EFGH: points E, F, G, H in order. So EF is 184, FG is 17, so GH is 184, HE is 17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's arrange them in that order on a straight line. So the line goes D-E-C-F, or maybe another order? Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, but it doesn't specify the order. Hmm, probably they're in the order D-E-C-F because that's the sequence given. So line DC is passing through E and F.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, D is connected to C. So if D, E, C, F are collinear, then E and F are on the line DC, which is one of the sides of the rectangle ABCD. So E is somewhere between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe E is before D, and F is after C? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. So D comes first, then E, then C, then F. So E and F are on the extension beyond C?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should assign coordinates to the points to make this clearer.

Let me place rectangle ABCD in a coordinate system. Let's set point D at the origin (0,0). Then since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC=16, AB=107, so the sides are 107 and 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0), B at (107,16), and A at (0,16).

Wait, no, actually, the sides are AB=107 and BC=16. So in rectangle ABCD, AB is the length, BC is the width. So moving from A to B is 107 units, then from B to C is 16 units.

Wait, my coordinate system assignment might be wrong. Let's think again. If ABCD is a rectangle, then the sides AB and CD are equal and parallel, as are BC and AD.

If AB=107 and BC=16, then AB is the length, BC is the height. So if I set point A at (0,0), then point B would be at (107,0), point C at (107,16), and point D at (0,16). That makes sense.

So A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). Now, rectangle EFGH: EF=184, FG=17. So the sides are 184 and 17. Let's assign coordinates to EFGH.

But where are these points placed? Since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's think about which line they lie on. Looking at ABCD's points, D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16). So the line DC is horizontal at y=16.

Wait, wait, no. In my previous assignment, D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16). So DC is the line y=16 from (0,16) to (107,16). So if E and F are on this line, their y-coordinates would also be 16.

But in rectangle EFGH, point E is connected to F, which is 184 units long, and F is connected to G, which is 17 units. Hmm.

Wait, but if E and F are on the line DC, which is at y=16, then EFGH is a rectangle with E and F on this line. But then H and G must be somewhere else.

Wait, but rectangle EFGH would have sides EF and FG perpendicular to each other. Since EF is along the line y=16, FG must be vertical. So from point F, moving up or down 17 units to reach G.

But in that case, the rectangle EFGH would have E and F on the line DC, and G and H either above or below. Also, since A, D, H, G are on a circle, which is the key.

Let me try assigning coordinates step by step.

Given ABCD has:

A(0,0),

B(107,0),

C(107,16),

D(0,16).

Now, E and F are on DC, which is from (0,16) to (107,16). So let's let E be at (x,16) and F at (x + 184,16) because EF=184. Wait, but the line DC is only 107 units long, from x=0 to x=107. So if EF is 184, which is longer than DC, E and F must be on the extended line beyond D and C.

Wait, so maybe E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C. So the line would be extended beyond D and C. So E is at (x,16), where x is negative, and F is at (x + 184,16), which would be beyond C at (107,16). So x + 184 = 107 + something? Wait, maybe I should let E be at (a,16) and F at (a + 184,16). Then since D is at (0,16) and C is at (107,16), E must be either to the left of D or to the right of C, and F accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps E is between D and C, but then F would be beyond C, but EF being 184 would place F far to the right.

Wait, but if E is between D and C, then E's x-coordinate is between 0 and 107. Then F would be at (E.x + 184, 16). So that would be way beyond C at 107. So F would be at (E.x + 184,16), which is much larger than 107.

Alternatively, if E is to the left of D, say at (-k,16), then F would be at (-k + 184, 16). So if -k + 184 is greater than 107, then F is beyond C.

So regardless, F is to the right of E, either within DC or beyond C.

But I need to find the coordinates of E and F such that EFGH is a rectangle, and points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates to EFGH.

Let me denote E as (e,16) because it's on DC which is y=16. Then F is (e + 184,16). Since EF=184, and it's along the x-axis at y=16.

Now, rectangle EFGH. So from F, moving perpendicularly to EF to get to G. Since EF is along the x-axis, FG must be vertical. FG=17, so it can be either upwards or downwards.

Let me assume it's upwards for now. So G would be at (e + 184,16 +17) = (e + 184, 33). Then H would be at (e,16 +17) = (e,33). So EFGH would be from E(e,16) to F(e + 184,16) to G(e + 184,33) to H(e,33) and back to E.

Alternatively, if FG is downward, G would be at (e + 184, -1), but that might complicate things since A is at (0,0). Hmm.

But the other condition is that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,33), G(e + 184,33) must lie on the same circle.

Wait, so four points: (0,0), (0,16), (e,33), (e + 184,33). All lying on a circle. So we can use the condition for concyclic points.

Alternatively, we can use the property that four points lie on a circle if the cross product is zero, or we can use the cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Another approach is to find the equation of the circle passing through three of the points and then check if the fourth lies on it.

Let me try that. Let me find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,0), D(0,16), and H(e,33). Then see if G(e + 184,33) also lies on it.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Since it passes through (0,0), plugging in gives 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 → c=0.

So the equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Now, plug in D(0,16):

0 + 256 + 0 + 32 f = 0 → 32 f = -256 → f = -8.

So equation now: x² + y² + 2g x -16 y = 0.

Now plug in H(e,33):

e² + 33² + 2g e -16*33 = 0 → e² + 1089 + 2g e - 528 = 0 → e² + 2g e + 561 = 0. Equation (1).

Now, check if G(e + 184,33) lies on this circle.

Plug into circle equation:

(e + 184)² + 33² + 2g(e + 184) -16*33 = 0.

Compute each term:

(e + 184)^2 = e² + 368e + (184)^2 = e² + 368e + 33856.

33² is 1089.

2g(e + 184) = 2g e + 368g.

-16*33 = -528.

So adding all together:

e² + 368e + 33856 + 1089 + 2g e + 368g -528 = 0.

Simplify:

e² + (368e + 2g e) + (33856 + 1089 -528) + 368g = 0.

Factor e terms:

e² + e(368 + 2g) + (33856 + 1089 -528) + 368g = 0.

Calculate constants:

33856 + 1089 = 34945; 34945 - 528 = 34417.

So:

e² + e(368 + 2g) + 34417 + 368g = 0. Equation (2).

Now, from equation (1):

e² + 2g e + 561 = 0.

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

[e² + e(368 + 2g) + 34417 + 368g] - [e² + 2g e + 561] = 0 - 0.

Simplify:

e² - e² + (368e + 2g e - 2g e) + (34417 + 368g -561) = 0.

So:

368e + (34417 - 561) + 368g = 0.

Calculate 34417 - 561: 34417 - 500 = 33917, 33917 -61= 33856.

So:

368e + 33856 + 368g = 0.

Divide both sides by 368:

e + (33856 / 368) + g = 0.

Compute 33856 / 368.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 33856 ÷16=2116, 368 ÷16=23.

So 2116 /23 = 92 (since 23*92=2116).

So e + 92 + g = 0 → e + g = -92.

So equation (3): e + g = -92.

From equation (1):

e² + 2g e + 561 = 0.

We can express g in terms of e using equation (3): g = -92 - e.

Substitute into equation (1):

e² + 2*(-92 - e)*e + 561 = 0.

Compute:

e² - 184e - 2e² +561 =0.

Combine like terms:

-e² -184e +561 =0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

e² + 184e -561 =0.

Now, solve for e using quadratic formula.

e = [-184 ± sqrt(184² + 4*561)] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

184² = 33856.

4*561 = 2244.

So discriminant is 33856 + 2244 = 36100.

sqrt(36100)=190.

So,

e = [-184 ±190]/2.

So two solutions:

1. (-184 +190)/2 = 6/2=3.

2. (-184 -190)/2= (-374)/2= -187.

So e=3 or e=-187.

So now, two possibilities for e: 3 or -187.

Let's consider each case.

Case 1: e=3.

Then from equation (3), g = -92 -3 = -95.

So the circle equation is x² + y² + 2*(-95)x -16y =0 → x² + y² -190x -16y =0.

Now, let's see if points H and G lie on this circle.

H is (e,33) = (3,33).

Check in circle equation:

3² +33² -190*3 -16*33 =9 + 1089 -570 -528 = 1098 - 1100 =-2 ≠0.

Wait, that's not zero. So H(3,33) doesn't lie on the circle? That can't be. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, because in equation (1), we substituted H(e,33), which gave us equation (1), so if e=3, H must lie on the circle. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, plugging H(3,33) into the circle equation:

3² + 33² + 2g*3 -16*33.

Wait, wait, the circle equation is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy =0. Since we had c=0, and f=-8, so 2f y is -16y.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the substitution earlier.

Wait, let me recast the circle equation. It was x² + y² + 2g x -16 y =0.

So plugging H(3,33):

3² +33² +2g*(3) -16*(33) =9 + 1089 +6g -528.

Compute: 9 +1089=1098; 1098 -528=570.

So 570 +6g=0 →6g= -570 →g= -95.

Which matches our earlier result. Then, substituting into the equation, H(3,33) should satisfy the equation.

Wait, let's compute 3² +33² -190*3 -16*33.

3²=9, 33²=1089.

-190*3= -570, -16*33= -528.

So 9 +1089=1098.

1098 -570=528.

528 -528=0. Oh, okay, so it does equal zero. So no problem.

Similarly, check G(e +184,33) = (3 +184,33)= (187,33).

Plug into circle equation:

187² +33² -190*187 -16*33.

Calculate each term:

187²: 187*187. Let me compute 200²=40000, subtract 13*200=2600 twice (since (200-13)^2=200² -2*200*13 +13²=40000 -5200 +169=34969). Wait, 187=200-13, so 187²= (200-13)^2=200² - 2*200*13 +13²=40000 -5200 +169=34969.

33²=1089.

-190*187: 190*187. Let me compute 200*187=37400, subtract 10*187=1870 →37400 -1870=35530. So -190*187= -35530.

-16*33= -528.

So adding all terms:

34969 + 1089=36058.

36058 -35530=528.

528 -528=0. Perfect, so G lies on the circle.

So case 1, e=3, is valid.

Case 2: e=-187.

Then from equation (3), g= -92 - (-187)=95.

So the circle equation is x² + y² +2*95 x -16 y =0 →x² + y² +190x -16 y=0.

Check H(-187,33):

(-187)^2 +33^2 +190*(-187) -16*33.

Compute:

(-187)^2=34969.

33²=1089.

190*(-187)= -35530.

-16*33= -528.

So sum: 34969 +1089=36058.

36058 -35530=528.

528 -528=0. So H lies on the circle.

Check G(e +184,33)= (-187 +184,33)= (-3,33).

Plug into circle equation:

(-3)^2 +33^2 +190*(-3) -16*33.

Compute:

9 + 1089=1098.

190*(-3)= -570.

-16*33= -528.

So 1098 -570=528.

528 -528=0. So G also lies on the circle.

So both cases are valid. So e=3 and e=-187.

Now, let's think about the geometry.

If e=3, then E is at (3,16), and F is at (3+184,16)= (187,16). So E is to the right of D(0,16) and F is way to the right beyond C(107,16).

If e=-187, then E is at (-187,16), and F is at (-187 +184,16)= (-3,16). So E is way to the left of D, and F is between D(0,16) and C(107,16), specifically at (-3,16). Wait, but F can't be at (-3,16) because in rectangle EFGH, F is connected to E and G. Wait, but in the case e=-187, F is at (-3,16), which is just to the left of D(0,16).

Wait, but in the rectangle EFGH, from E(-187,16), moving to F(-3,16), then up 17 units to G(-3,33), then back to H(-187,33). So that would make EFGH a rectangle with width 184 and height 17.

But in this case, points H and G are at (-187,33) and (-3,33). So A(0,0), D(0,16), H(-187,33), G(-3,33) lie on a circle.

Alternatively, in case e=3, E(3,16), F(187,16), G(187,33), H(3,33). So H and G are to the right of D and C.

But in the problem statement, it says D, E, C, F are collinear. So if in case e=3, E is at (3,16), which is between D(0,16) and C(107,16), and F is at (187,16), which is beyond C. So the order would be D(0), E(3), C(107), F(187). So they are in order D-E-C-F.

In the other case, e=-187, E is at (-187,16), then F at (-3,16). So the order on the line would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So it's E-F-D-C.

Hmm. The problem doesn't specify the order, just that D, E, C, F are collinear. So both cases are possible.

But perhaps the length CE is the same in both cases. Let's check.

Wait, in case e=3: E is at (3,16), C is at (107,16). So CE is |107 -3|=104.

In case e=-187: E is at (-187,16), C is at (107,16). So CE is |107 - (-187)|= |107 +187|=294.

So CE can be 104 or 294. But the problem asks for the length of CE. Since both cases are possible, perhaps we need more information to decide which one is the correct configuration.

Wait, but maybe one of the cases leads to a rectangle EFGH overlapping with ABCD in a way that makes it impossible.

Wait, in case e=3: E is at (3,16), F at (187,16). So EFGH is a rectangle with E at (3,16), F at (187,16), G at (187,33), H at (3,33). So EFGH is to the right of ABCD, above it. So no overlap.

In case e=-187: E is at (-187,16), F at (-3,16). So EFGH has E at (-187,16), F at (-3,16), G at (-3,33), H at (-187,33). So EFGH is to the left of ABCD, above it. So again, no overlap.

Hmm, but maybe the problem expects the minimal length, or perhaps the length 104 is more plausible given the sizes.

Wait, but BC is 16, AB is 107, so ABCD is a rectangle 107x16. EFGH is 184x17. So EFGH is much longer in the x-direction.

Wait, but in the first case, CE is 104, which is less than 184. In the second case, CE is 294, which is longer than 184.

Wait, but in case e=3, F is at (187,16). So EFGH is from (3,16) to (187,16), which is 184 units. So that matches the given FG=17, which is the height.

So both cases seem valid, but perhaps the problem expects the smaller length CE=104.

Wait, but let's think about the circle. If A, D, H, G are on a circle, and in case e=3, H is at (3,33), G at (187,33). So A(0,0), D(0,16), H(3,33), G(187,33).

Alternatively, in case e=-187, H is at (-187,33), G at (-3,33).

In both cases, the four points lie on a circle. So both configurations are possible.

But the problem says "last line of your response should be your integer answer within \boxed{}". So perhaps I need to consider both possibilities and see if both are valid or if one is invalid.

Wait, in the case where e=-187, F is at (-3,16). But in that case, F is between D(0,16) and E(-187,16), but since EF is 184, E is 184 units left of F. So if F is at (-3,16), E is at (-3 -184,16)= (-187,16). So that's correct.

But in the problem statement, it's given that D, E, C, F are collinear. So in case e=-187, the order would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So E, F, D, C in that order on the line y=16. So that's acceptable.

In case e=3, the order is D(0), E(3), C(107), F(187). So the order is D, E, C, F. So the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear, so both cases fit.

But the problem asks for CE. So CE is either 104 or 294. How to decide which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem implies that E is between D and C, making F beyond C. Because it's stated that D, E, C, F are collinear, which suggests that E is between D and C, then F beyond.

But in reality, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, but it doesn't specify the order. So both configurations are possible. So perhaps both CE=104 and CE=294 are possible. But the problem asks for CE. Maybe I have to find both? But the problem expects a single answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the rectangle EFGH. Let me check.

In case e=3:

E(3,16), F(187,16), G(187,33), H(3,33). So EFGH is a rectangle above ABCD, extending to the right.

In this case, since E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, CE is 107 -3=104.

In case e=-187:

E(-187,16), F(-3,16), G(-3,33), H(-187,33). Here, E is far left, F is left of D. Then CE is 107 - (-187)=294.

So both are possible.

Wait, but the problem says "the length of CE". So perhaps the answer is 104, as the other case would require F to be to the left of D, which is possible, but maybe the problem expects the smaller length.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the cases is possible because of the circle condition.

Wait, let's think about the cyclic quadrilateral. In case e=3:

Points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(3,33), G(187,33) lie on a circle. So the circle passes through these points.

Similarly, in case e=-187, it passes through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(-187,33), G(-3,33).

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "A, D, H, G all lie on a circle." So both cases satisfy this condition.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. But perhaps the problem expects both solutions, but the problem says "what is the length of CE?" which suggests a unique answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check the case e=3 again.

In case e=3, F is at (187,16). So EFGH has F at (187,16), G at (187,33), H at (3,33). So from F(187,16) to G(187,33) is 17 units, which matches FG=17.

In case e=-187, F is at (-3,16), G is at (-3,33). So FG is 17 units, correct.

So both cases are correct.

Wait, but perhaps in one case, the rectangle EFGH is on one side, and the other case on the opposite. But the problem doesn't specify direction, so perhaps both are acceptable.

But the problem asks for CE. Hmm, if I imagine both cases, CE is either 104 or 294. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the points are labeled in order ABCD and EFGH, which might imply that EFGH is adjacent in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the minimal CE, which is 104.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the cases is possible because of the way the rectangles are drawn.

Wait, another thought: in the problem statement, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF is a side, FG is another. So EF is length 184, FG is 17.

In case e=3, E is at (3,16), F at (187,16). So from E to F is right along y=16. Then from F up to G, which is 17 units, correct.

In case e=-187, from E(-187,16) to F(-3,16), then up to G(-3,33), which is 17 units. So both are possible.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the diagram as per the problem statement. The problem says "Rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear." So D is a corner of ABCD, E is a corner of EFGH, and C is a corner of ABCD, and F is a corner of EFGH.

So perhaps the order is D-E-C-F on the line, meaning that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. So that would correspond to case e=3, where E is at (3,16), between D(0,16) and C(107,16), and F is at (187,16), beyond C.

So in that case, CE is 107 -3=104.

So the answer is 104.

Alternatively, if the order were E-F-D-C, then e=-187. But in that case, E is way to the left, F is left of D, which would be a different configuration. But perhaps the problem implies that E is between D and C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that D,E,C,F are collinear, but in the problem statement, it's written as D,E,C,F, which could imply that they are in that order on the line.

In that case, E comes after D, before C, and F comes after C. So that would correspond to e=3, so CE=104.

So I think the answer is 104.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ with the conditions that $D, E, C, F$ are collinear and $A, D, H, G$ lie on a circle. The lengths provided are $BC=16$, $AB=107$, $FG=17$, and $EF=184$. We aim to find the length of $CE$.

1. **Assigning Coordinates:**
   - Place rectangle $ABCD$ in a coordinate system with $A(0,0)$, $B(107,0)$, $C(107,16)$, and $D(0,16)$.
   - Points $E$ and $F$ lie on the line $DC$ (which is horizontal at $y=16$). Let $E$ be at $(e,16)$ and $F$ at $(e+184,16)$.

2. **Circle Condition:**
   - Points $A(0,0)$, $D(0,16)$, $H(e,33)$, and $G(e+184,33)$ must lie on a circle. Using the general equation of a circle and substituting these points, we derive the relationship between $e$ and the circle's parameters.

3. **Solving for $e$:**
   - After solving the equations, we find two possible values for $e$: $e=3$ and $e=-187$.

4. **Analyzing Configurations:**
   - For $e=3$, $E$ is at $(3,16)$, $F$ is at $(187,16)$, and $CE=107-3=104$.
   - For $e=-187$, $E$ is at $(-187,16)$, $F$ is at $(-3,16)$, and $CE=107-(-187)=294$.

5. **Determining the Correct Configuration:**
   - The problem implies that $D, E, C, F$ are collinear in the order $D-E-C-F$. This corresponds to $e=3$, making $CE=104$.

Thus, the length of $CE$ is $\boxed{104}$.
