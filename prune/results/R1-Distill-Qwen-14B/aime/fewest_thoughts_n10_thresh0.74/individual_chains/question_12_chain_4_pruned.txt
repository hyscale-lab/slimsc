Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when I read the numbers left to right from each row, their sum should be 999. The second condition is that when I read the numbers top to bottom from each column, their sum should be 99. 

Hmm, let me parse this. So the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. Each cell will contain a single digit. 

Let me try to visualize the grid:

a b c
d e f

So the first row is a, b, c, forming a three-digit number, which I'll call ABC. The second row is d, e, f, another three-digit number, DEF. The sum ABC + DEF should be 999.

Wait, but actually, since each row is a three-digit number, their sum is 999. So ABC + DEF = 999.

Then, for the columns, each column is a two-digit number. The first column is AD, the second is BE, and the third is CF. So the sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99. So AD + BE + CF = 99.

Alright, so I need to find all possible digit assignments to a, b, c, d, e, f such that both these conditions are satisfied.

Let me break this down. Maybe I can express each condition in terms of equations.

First, the sum of the two three-digit numbers being 999:

ABC + DEF = 999.

Expressed numerically, that's:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Which simplifies to:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

So that's equation one.

Then, the sum of the three two-digit numbers being 99:

AD + BE + CF = 99.

Which is:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Simplify that:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So that's equation two.

Hmm, so now I have two equations:

1. 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

2. 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

I think I can manipulate these equations to find some relationships between the variables.

Let me denote S = a + d, T = b + e, U = c + f.

Then equation 1 becomes:

100S + 10T + U = 999.

Equation 2: Let's see, equation two is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Notice that a + b + c is the sum of the first row, which is (100a + 10b + c)/100. Wait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, since S = a + d, T = b + e, U = c + f, then the sum d + e + f is (S + T + U) - (a + b + c). Hmm, maybe that's complicating it.

Wait, in equation two, let me write it in terms of a, b, c, d, e, f:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Which is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But from equation one, we have S = a + d, T = b + e, U = c + f.

So, the sum d + e + f is (S + T + U) - (a + b + c). Hmm, maybe not the most straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can subtract equation two from equation one to see if that helps.

Wait, equation one is 100S + 10T + U =999.

Equation two is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e
