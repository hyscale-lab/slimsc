Okay, so I have this geometry problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to visualize what's going on.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point A is on the x-axis, halfway between O and (1,0), and point B is on the y-axis, somewhere above (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. Then, the segment AB connects these two points. I should probably sketch this to get a better idea.

Next, there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is like a line segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the length of PQ is 1, which gives us the equation sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these unit segments, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the distance between A and B. The distance formula is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)² + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)²] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is a unit segment, so AB is in F.

But we're looking for a point C on AB that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C doesn't lie on them. So, C is somehow special on AB—it's the only point on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other PQ in F.

Our goal is to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express that as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, so how do I approach this?

First, let's parametrize point C on AB. Since AB is a line segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), I can write any point C on AB as a linear combination. Let me use a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So, the coordinates of C can be expressed as:
x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) * t

Because as t increases from 0 to 1, x decreases from 1/2 to 0, and y increases from 0 to sqrt(3)/2.

So, C = ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2)

Now, the point C must not lie on any other PQ in F except AB. So, to ensure this, for all other segments PQ in F, C shouldn't lie on PQ. So, if I can find the condition such that C is only on AB and no other PQ in F, that should give me the unique point C.

Alternatively, for C to not lie on any other PQ in F, the line PQ, for any other P and Q (other than A and B), shouldn't pass through C. So, if I can find such a point C on AB where this is true, that's our point.

Wait, but how do I ensure that? Maybe there's a way to parametrize all possible PQs in F and ensure that C doesn't lie on any of those, except AB.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is such that the tangent from C to the curve defined by F only touches AB. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So, any such PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p² + q² = 1.

So, for a general point (x,y) in the first quadrant, the condition that it doesn't lie on any PQ in F (other than AB) would mean that it's not on any such segment except AB.

But in our case, the point C is on AB, so it's on AB, which is in F, but we need it not to lie on any other PQ in F.

So, for point C on AB, we need that there doesn't exist any other PQ in F such that C lies on PQ.

So, for point C, the only PQ in F that contains it is AB.

Therefore, the equation of PQ must pass through C, but the only such PQ is AB.

So, for point C, the equation of any line PQ (with p² + q²=1) that passes through C must correspond to PQ=AB.

So, perhaps, to find C, I can find the point on AB such that the line AB is the only line in F passing through C.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the envelope of all such PQ segments, and then find where AB intersects this envelope, which would give us point C.

Wait, the envelope of the family F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. So, in this case, the envelope of all PQ segments in F would be a curve such that each PQ is tangent to it.

If I can find this envelope, then the point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because then, AB touches the envelope only at C, and for all other PQ in F, they're on the other side of the envelope, not passing through C.

So, let's try to find the envelope of
