Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from the same set S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. If all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize (i.e., all four numbers matching), and event B is winning a prize (i.e., at least two numbers matching). Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two numbers matching, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

Alright, let's compute P(A) first. P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen in the random selection. Since both Jen and the lottery are selecting 4 numbers from 10, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for P(A) is 1, because there's only one way all four of her numbers are picked. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. This is the same as 1 minus the probability that fewer than two numbers are chosen. So, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

Let's compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

P(0 matches): The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 numbers not chosen by Jen. Since Jen picked 4, there are 6 left. So, the number of ways is C(6,4). Thus, P(0) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

Similarly, P(1 match): The number of ways to choose exactly 1 number from Jen's 4 and the remaining 3 from the other 6. So, that's C(4,1)*C(6,3).

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - [C(6,4)/C(10,4) + (C(4,1)*C(6,3))/C(10,4)].

Let me compute each term:

C(6,4) = 15.

C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210.

Wait, because C(10,4) is 210, so denominator is 210 for both terms.

15 + 80 is 95, so 95/210. Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me double-check that. 10 choose 4 is 210, yes. 6 choose 4 is 15, correct. 4 choose 1 is 4, 6 choose 3 is 20, so 4*20=80. So, 15+80=95. So, 95/210 is the probability of 0 or 1 match. So, 1 - 95/210 is indeed 115/210.

Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on. Wait, 115 divided by 5 is 23? 5*23 is 115, yes. 210 ÷5 is 42, correct. So, P(B)=23/42.

But let me think again. Because the problem says she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the chosen four. So, the probability of winning a prize is the probability of having exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.

Alternatively, another way to compute P(B) is to compute the sum of probabilities of exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches.

Let me see if that's equal to 115/210.

Let me compute each:

Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). So, 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 *6=24.

Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

So, total favorable for B: 90 +24 +1=115.

Thus, P(B)=115/210, same as before. So, that's correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, P(B)=115/210.

Therefore, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Hmm, so 1/115 is the probability. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, since 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with them. So, m=1, n=115. So, m +n=1+115=116.

Wait, is that right? Hmm, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the conditional probability.

Wait, P(A|B) is the probability that all four numbers match given that at least two match.

So, in other words, given that at least two of her numbers are in the winning set, what's the chance all four are?

So, the formula is correct: P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B). Because A is a subset of B.

So, yes, since if you have four matches, you must have at least two.

Thus, the probability is 1/115.

So, m +n is 1 + 115=116.

Wait, but let me think again about P(B). Another way to compute P(B) is to sum the probabilities of exactly 2,3,4 matches.

Earlier, we saw that exactly two: 90, exactly three:24, exactly four:1. So total 115. Which is correct because C(10,4)=210, so 115/210=23/42.

And P(A)=1/210. So, 1/210 divided by 115/210 is 1/115.

Alright, so the answer is 1/115, so m +n=116.

I think that's correct.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we calculate \( P(A|B) \), with \( A \) being the event of winning the grand prize and \( B \) the event of winning a prize.

1. **Calculate \( P(A) \):**  
   The probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. This is:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( P(B) \):**  
   The probability of winning a prize is the probability of having at least two matching numbers. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   P(B) = 1 - P(0 \text{ matches}) - P(1 \text{ match})
   \]
   - \( P(0 \text{ matches}) \): Choosing 4 numbers from the 6 not chosen by Jen:
     \[
     P(0) = \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210}
     \]
   - \( P(1 \text{ match}) \): Choosing 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the other 6:
     \[
     P(1) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{80}{210}
     \]
   Thus:
   \[
   P(B) = 1 - \frac{15}{210} - \frac{80}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( P(A|B) \):**  
   Using the conditional probability formula:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]
   The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
