Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation that can move all the blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. Let me try to understand the problem better. So, it's a regular octagon, which means all sides and angles are equal. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with probability 1/2, independently. So, each coloring is equally likely.

The question is about the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. Wait, so if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, then every blue vertex in the new position was red before the rotation? Or is it that after rotation, the blue vertices are now where the red ones were located?

Alternatively, maybe it's that after rotation, every blue vertex is mapped to a position that was originally red. So, the image of the blue vertices under some rotation is a subset of the red vertices.

I think that's the case. So, the octagon can be rotated, and the set of blue vertices can be rotated to a set that was entirely red. So, for such a rotation to exist, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so its symmetries are cyclic rotations and reflections. But the problem specifies a rotation, so we don't have to consider reflections. So, the group of rotations is of order 8, corresponding to rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, which can be thought of as rotations by 0,1,2,...,7 steps, where each step is 45°.

So, for each coloring, we need to check whether there exists a rotation (i.e., a group element) such that when we apply that rotation, all the blue vertices are moved to positions that were originally red.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be a translate (rotation) of the set of red vertices. Since red and blue are complementary (each vertex is either red or blue), the set of blue vertices is the complement of the set of red vertices.

Wait, so if the set of blue vertices
