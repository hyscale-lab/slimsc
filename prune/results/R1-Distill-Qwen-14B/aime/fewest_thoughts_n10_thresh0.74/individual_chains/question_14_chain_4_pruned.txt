Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Alright, so first, I need to find the largest four-digit number N such that if any single digit is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Once I have N, I can divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, and then add Q and R together for the final answer.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the largest such N with the given property. So, perhaps I can start by considering the largest four-digit number, which is 9999, and check if it satisfies the condition. If it does, great, that's our N. If not, I'll have to check the next largest number, 9998, and so on, until I find one that meets the requirement.

But checking each number one by one might take a long time, especially since I have to check four different changes for each number (changing each digit to 1). So, maybe I can find a smarter way to determine what N must look like.

Let me think about the condition: changing any one digit to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. That means, for each digit position in N, replacing that digit with 1 gives a multiple of 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: digits are A, B, C, D. So N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, when we change each digit to 1 one by one:

1. Change A to 1: the number becomes 1BCD. So 1000 + 100B + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.
2. Change B to 1: the number becomes A1CD. So 1000A + 100 + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.
3. Change C to 1: the number becomes AB1D. So 1000A + 100B + 10 + D must be divisible by 7.
4. Change D to 1: the number becomes ABC1. So 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, all four of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. 

I can write each modified number as:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, so each of these expressions must be congruent to 0 modulo 7. Let me see if I can express each of these in terms of N or some other expressions.

Wait, but N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, when I change a digit to 1, I'm subtracting some amount and adding 1 in a specific place. Let's consider each case:

1. Changing A to 1: original N is 1000A + ... So new number is N - (1000A - 1000) = N - 1000(A - 1). So, N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. Changing B to 1: N - (100B - 100) = N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. Changing C to 1: N - (10C - 10) = N - 10(C - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. Changing D to 1: N - (D - 1) = N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, each of these expressions:

1. N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N - 10(C - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Which implies:

1. N ≡ 1000(A - 1) mod 7
2. N ≡ 100(B - 1) mod 7
3. N ≡ 10(C - 1) mod 7
4. N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

Wait, but N is the same in all these congruences. So, all four of these expressions must be equal to each other modulo 7.

So:

1000(A - 1) ≡ 100(B - 1) ≡ 10(C - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

This seems complicated, but maybe I can compute each coefficient modulo 7 to simplify.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

7 * 142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 / 7 is 14 * 7 = 98, so 100 - 98 = 2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, substituting these:

1000(A - 1) ≡ 6*(A - 1) mod 7

100(B - 1) ≡ 2*(B - 1) mod 7

10(C - 1) ≡ 3*(C - 1) mod 7

(D - 1) ≡ 1*(D - 1) mod 7

So, all of these must be congruent to each other modulo 7.

So, 6*(A - 1) ≡ 2*(B - 1) ≡ 3*(C - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod 7.

Let me denote this common value as k mod 7. So,

6*(A - 1) ≡ k mod 7

2*(B - 1) ≡ k mod 7

3*(C - 1) ≡ k mod 7

(D - 1) ≡ k mod 7

So, now I can express each of these in terms of k.

Let me solve each equation for the respective variable.

1. 6*(A - 1) ≡ k mod 7

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 6 mod 7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, the inverse exists. Let's find it. 6*x ≡ 1 mod 7. Testing x=6: 6*6=36 ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 35 is 5*7). So inverse of 6 is 6.

Thus, (A - 1) ≡ 6*k mod 7 => A ≡ 6k + 1 mod 7.

Similarly for the other variables:

2. 2*(B - 1) ≡ k mod 7

Inverse of 2 mod 7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

Thus, (B - 1) ≡ 4k mod7 => B ≡4k + 1 mod7.

3. 3*(C - 1) ≡k mod7.

Inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, (C -1) ≡5k mod7 => C≡5k +1 mod7.

4. D -1 ≡k mod7 => D≡k +1 mod7.

So, now, I can write each digit in terms of k:

A ≡6k +1 mod7

B ≡4k +1 mod7

C ≡5k +1 mod7

D ≡k +1 mod7

Since A, B, C, D are digits (0-9, except A cannot be 0 as it's a four-digit number), each must satisfy:

A is between 1 and 9,

B, C, D between 0 and 9.

So, for each possible k (0 to 6), we can compute A, B, C, D modulo 7, and then see what the actual digits could be.

But since N is the largest four-digit number with this property, we want N to be as large as possible, so we need to maximize A, then B, then C, then D.

So, since A is the thousands digit, making it as large as possible would give a larger N. So, ideally, A=9, but depending on the constraints.

But we have to consider the congruences.

So, let's consider possible values of k from 0 to 6.

For each k, determine the digits A, B, C, D modulo 7, then find the maximum possible A, B, C, D that satisfy those congruences, and then check whether the number N satisfies the original condition.

But perhaps we can find the exact digits.

Wait, since we're dealing with mod7, the digits will be in the range 0-6 for their congruences, but actual digits can be higher.

Wait, let me correct that: when I say A ≡6k +1 mod7, it means that A can be 6k +1, 6k +1
