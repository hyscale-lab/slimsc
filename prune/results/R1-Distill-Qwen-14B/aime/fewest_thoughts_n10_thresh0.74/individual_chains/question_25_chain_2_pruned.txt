Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and what they own. Hmm, let me try to make sense of it step by step. 

The problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which is good to note. Then, it mentions three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

Additionally, we're told that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items: the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and the candy hearts. 

Wait a minute, since every resident owns a candy heart, that means that the candy hearts are kind of a given. So when considering the other three items, the ownership is among all 900 people. 

So, I think the problem is essentially about sets and their intersections. Let me recall some set theory principles here. The principle of inclusion-exclusion comes to mind, which is used to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets would be something like:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

But in this case, we're dealing with four things, but since everyone owns the candy hearts, maybe the problem can be simplified. Alternatively, perhaps the candy hearts are just a distraction, and the problem is about the three items, with the fourth being the candy hearts which everyone has. So, in that case, the problem is about three items, and all the residents have at least the candy hearts. So perhaps the problem is about how many have all three of the other items, along with the candy hearts, which they all have.

Wait, but the question is about the number who own all four. Since everyone owns the candy hearts, that would mean the number of people owning all four is the same as the number of people owning all three of the other items. Because if someone owns all three (diamond, golf, spade), they automatically own the
