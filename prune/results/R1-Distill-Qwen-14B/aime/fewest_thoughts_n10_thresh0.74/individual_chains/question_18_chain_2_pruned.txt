Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, I've heard of counting rectangles in grids before, but this seems a bit different because it's a 12-sided polygon. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

The problem mentions that each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, I think I need to figure out all possible pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel, right?

Wait, in a regular polygon, certain lines can be parallel depending on how many sides they skip. For example, in a regular hexagon, lines that skip one vertex are parallel. Maybe in a dodecagon, similar logic applies but with different numbers.

Let me think about how diagonals in a regular polygon work. In a regular n-gon, a diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices. The number of diagonals is n(n-3)/2. But here, I need more than just the count; I need to find pairs that are parallel and can form opposite sides of a rectangle.

In a regular polygon, two diagonals are parallel if they skip the same number of vertices. So, for a dodecagon, if I connect a vertex to another vertex that's k steps away, then another pair of vertices connected k steps away will be parallel. So, for each k, the diagonals that skip k vertices are parallel.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, which diagonals are parallel? Let me recall. For a regular polygon with even number of sides, like 12, there are more sets of parallel sides and diagonals.

So, in a regular 12-gon, sides are the edges connecting consecutive vertices. Diagonals can be of different lengths. The number of steps between connected vertices determines the diagonal's length. For example, connecting every other vertex gives a longer diagonal, and so on.

For a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines. So, I think the sides of the rectangle will be formed by two different types of lines: one type for the horizontal sides and another for the vertical sides, but in this case, since it's a regular dodecagon, the concept of horizontal and vertical isn't the same as in a grid. Instead, the sides will be determined by the angles of the polygon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Then, each vertex can be represented as a point on the circumference, with angles at multiples of 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). So, the vertices are at angles 0째, 30째, 60째, ..., up to 330째.
