Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation which, when applied, moves all the blue vertices to positions that were originally red. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. That means I can rotate it by multiples of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45). Each rotation will shift the vertices around, and I need to see if there's a rotation that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices.

Wait, but the problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, the blue vertices must correspond exactly to the red vertices under some rotation. That would imply that the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices.

But since each vertex is colored either red or blue independently, the probability we're looking for is the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set, divided by the total number of colorings, which is 2^8 = 256.

So, I need to count how many such colorings exist where the blue vertices form a rotation of the red vertices. Alternatively, for each possible rotation, count the number of colorings that are fixed by that rotation, but I have to be careful not to overcount.

Wait, maybe using group theory here would help, specifically Burnside's lemma? Burnside's lemma counts the number of orbits by averaging the number of fixed points of each group action. Here, the group is the cyclic group C8, consisting of rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°.

But I'm not sure if I need to apply Burnside's lemma here. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of colorings for which the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

Wait, the only way the blue set is a rotated version of the red set is if the blue set is equal to some rotation of the red set. But since the octagon is regular, the set of red vertices must be a rotation of the blue set.

Wait, but each coloring is determined by the set of blue vertices. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, that would mean that the blue set is a rotation of its complement.

So, for a given coloring, the blue set is a subset of the octagon's vertices. We want to know if this subset is a rotation of its complement. That is, the blue set and the red set are rotations of each other.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S of the octagon's vertices such that S is a rotation of its complement. Then, the probability is that number divided by 256.

So, how do I count such subsets? Let's think about the symmetries of the octagon.

Each rotation can be represented by shifting the vertices by k positions, where k is from 0 to 7. So, for a subset S to be a rotation of its complement, there must exist some k such that rotating S by k positions gives the complement of S.

Wait, but the complement of S is the set of red vertices. So, if S is the set of blue vertices, then the condition is that rotating S by k positions gives the red set, which is the complement of S. So, S rotated by k is equal to the complement of S.

Which implies that S is equal to the complement of S rotated by k. So, S is a rotation of its complement.

Alternatively, S union (rotated S) is equal to the entire set, but that might not be directly helpful.

Wait, for S to be a rotation of its complement, the size of S must equal the size of its complement. Because a rotation doesn't change the size. So, the size of S must be equal to the size of the complement, which implies that |S| = 4. Because the octagon has 8 vertices.

So, we can restrict our attention to subsets S of size 4, since only those subsets can be rotations of their complements (which are also size 4). Subsets of other sizes can't satisfy this condition because their complements would have a different size, and a rotation can't change the size.

Therefore, the number of such subsets S is equal to the number of size-4 subsets that are rotations of their complements.

So, how many subsets of size 4 are equal to a rotation of their complements?

Wait, let's think about what it means for a subset S of size 4 to be a rotation of its complement. Let’s denote the rotation by k positions as r^k(S). So, r^k(S) = complement(S), which is the same as S = r^{-k}(complement(S)) = complement(r^k(S)). Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, for each rotation k, the number of subsets S such that r^k(S) = complement(S). But each such S must satisfy that applying rotation k twice gives the identity? Maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, if S is a subset such that r^k(S) = complement(S), then applying rotation k again gives r^{2k}(S) = complement(r^k(S)) = complement(complement(S)) = S. So, r^{2k}(S) = S. So, S is fixed under rotation by 2k. Therefore, the subset S must be periodic with period gcd(8, 2k). Hmm, maybe this is getting somewhere.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of necklaces. The problem is similar to counting binary necklaces of length 8 with certain properties. Each subset S can be thought of as a binary necklace where 1 represents blue and 0 represents red.

Wait, but we need S such that rotating S by some k gives the complement of S. So, for each k, the number of S with r^k(S) = complement(S) is equal to the number of S such that S is a fixed point under rotation by 2k because r^{2k}(S) = S as above.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider each possible rotation and see if it can take S to its complement.

Let’s consider all possible rotations (including the identity rotation). For each rotation, count the number of colorings fixed by that rotation where the blue set is the rotation of the red set. Then, sum over all rotations, and divide by the group size (8) to get the total number of such colorings.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about each rotation and see how many colorings are fixed by that rotation and satisfy the condition that blue vertices can be rotated to red ones.

But perhaps another approach: For a given rotation k, the number of colorings where the blue set is mapped to the red set by rotation k is equal to the number of colorings fixed by rotation 2k, since applying rotation k twice would map blue to red and then red to blue again. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such colorings is equal to the number of orbits under the rotation group where the coloring is such that blue and red sets are rotations of each other.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should try small cases first.

Suppose the octagon is smaller, say a square (n=4). Let's see what the probability would be in that case.

For a square, each vertex is colored red or blue. The probability that there exists a rotation mapping blue to red.

In the square case, the possible colorings are 16. The number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

For n=4, the possible subsets S of size 2 (since 4/2=2) that are rotations of their complements.

In the square, the subsets S of size 2 that are rotations of their complements are those that are symmetric under rotation by 180 degrees or not.

Wait, for S to be a rotation of its complement, the size must be 2. So, we need S such that S is a rotation of its complement.

In the square, the possible subsets of size 2 are:

1. Two adjacent vertices: e.g., {1,2}. The complement is {3,4}, which is two adjacent vertices but opposite. Rotating by 180 degrees would swap these. So, for S = {1,2}, the complement is {3,4}, which is a rotation of S by 180 degrees. So, in this case, S is a rotation of its complement.

Similarly, S = {2,3} and its complement {1,4} is a rotation by 270 degrees? Wait, in the square, the complement of {2,3} is {1,4}, which is not a rotation of {2,3}, because rotating {2,3} by 90 degrees would give {3,4}, which is not {1,4}.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me label the square vertices as 1,2,3,4 in order.

- S = {1,2}: complement is {3,4}. Rotating S by 180 degrees gives {3,4}, so yes, it's a rotation.

- S = {1,3}: complement is {2,4}. Rotating S by 180 degrees gives {3,1}, which is same as {1,3}, so that's not the complement. Wait, so is {1,3} a rotation of its complement?

Wait, the complement of {1,3} is {2,4}. Is {2,4} a rotation of {1,3}? Rotating {1,3} by 90 degrees: 1→2, 3→4, so {2,4}. So yes, {2,4} is a rotation of {1,3} by 90 degrees. Therefore, S = {1,3} also satisfies the condition.

Similarly, {1,4}: complement is {2,3}. Rotating {1,4} by 180 degrees would give {3,2}, which is same as {2,3}, so yes, it's a rotation.

Wait, so in the square, each subset of size 2 is either a rotation of its complement or not. Wait, no. Let's list all subsets of size 2.

Total subsets: 6.

Each subset S of size 2:

1. {1,2}: complement is {3,4}, which is a rotation of S by 180 degrees. So yes.

2. {1,3}: complement is {2,4}, which is a rotation of S by 90 degrees. So yes.

3. {1,4}: complement is {2,3}, which is a rotation of S by 180 degrees. So yes.

4. {2,3}: complement is {1,4}, which is a rotation of S by 180 degrees. So yes.

5. {2,4}: complement is {1,3}, which is a rotation of S by 90 degrees. So yes.

6. {3,4}: complement is {1,2}, which is a rotation of S by 180 degrees. So yes.

Wait a second, in the square case, every subset of size 2 is a rotation of its complement. So, the number of such subsets is 6. But since the total number of colorings is 16, the probability is 6/16.

But wait, that can't be right because in the square, colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set would correspond to the subsets S where S is a rotation of the complement, which in this case, every subset of size 2 satisfies that condition. So, the number of such colorings is 6, each corresponding to a subset of size 2.

But then the probability is 6/16 = 3/8.

Wait, but that seems high. For example, if I color two opposite vertices blue and the other two red, then rotating by 180 degrees would swap the blue and red vertices. So, that's a valid case. Similarly, for other subsets.

But wait, in the square, all subsets of size 2 have their complements as rotations. So, maybe in the octagon, the situation is similar, but only for certain subsets.

Wait, but in the octagon, n=8. So, half the vertices are 4, so subsets of size 4 could satisfy S being a rotation of its complement. But not all subsets of size 4 necessarily do that.

So, perhaps in the octagon, the number of such subsets is more than in the square, but it's not all subsets of size 4.

So, going back, in the octagon, the number of subsets S of size 4 such that S is a rotation of its complement (i.e., the complement is a rotation of S).

So, how many such subsets S are there?

Each such subset S is a rotation of its complement. So, for each rotation k, we can have a subset S where S rotated by k is its complement.

But perhaps it's better to think about necklaces. The number of necklaces with 8 beads, 4 black and 4 white, such that the necklace is symmetric in the way that rotating it by k positions inverts the colors.

Wait, that's an interesting thought. So, for a necklace with 4 black and 4 white beads, if rotating it by k positions inverts the color of each bead, then the subset S (black beads) is a rotation of its complement (white beads).

But for such a rotation to invert colors, the rotation must be such that each bead is mapped to the bead of the opposite color. So, this requires that the rotation is by k positions, and that 2k is a multiple of 8, i.e., k is 4 positions. Because only then, each bead is mapped to the bead diametrically opposite to it.

Wait, let me think: For the octagon, each bead has a unique diametrically opposite bead. So, if you rotate by 4 positions, each bead goes to the one opposite. So, in that case, the color of bead i is the same as bead i+4. So, for the color to invert upon rotation by 4, each bead must be the opposite color of the bead 4 positions away.

But in that case, the subset S must be such that for each bead i, bead i is blue if and only if bead i+4 is red. So, the subset S is the set of blue beads, and S must be exactly the set of beads such that bead i is blue iff bead i+4 is red. That would require that S is a self-complementary set under a 4-position rotation.

In other words, S must be equal to the complement of S rotated by 4 positions. So, S = r^4(complement(S)).

But since r^4 is rotation by 180 degrees, each bead is mapped to the one opposite.

So, in this case, the subset S must satisfy S = r^4(complement(S)).

But since r^4 is an involution (applying it twice gives the identity), this implies that S is a fixed point under the rotation by 8 positions, which is the identity, so that's trivial.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a graph where each bead i is connected to bead i+4 mod 8. So, the octagon is divided into two cycles of four beads each: {1,5,2,6,3,7,4,8}? Wait, no, wait, 1+4=5, 5+4=1, so actually, it's two separate cycles: {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}, {4,8}.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when you rotate by 4, you map bead 1 to 5, 5 to 1, 2 to 6, 6 to 2, etc. So, the rotation by 4 partitions the octagon into four independent transpositions: (1 5), (2 6), (3 7), (4 8). Each pair is swapped under rotation by 4.

Therefore, for S to satisfy S = r^4(complement(S)), each pair must have exactly one blue and one red vertex. Because if bead i is blue, then bead i+4 must be red, and vice versa.

Therefore, each of the four pairs must have exactly one blue and one red bead.

So, in each pair, we can choose either the first or the second bead to be blue. So, for each of the four independent pairs, we have 2 choices. Thus, the total number of such subsets S is 2^4 = 16.

So, there are 16 subsets of size 4 where each pair has exactly one blue and one red bead. Therefore, in this case, S is a rotation of its complement (under rotation by 4).

Now, but wait, are there other rotations besides rotation by 4 that can satisfy S being a rotation of its complement? For example, could there be a rotation by k where k is not 4 that also allows S to be a rotation of its complement?

Let me think. Suppose we have a rotation by k positions that maps S to its complement. Then, as before, applying rotation k twice would map S to its complement and then back to S. So, r^{2k}(S) = S. Therefore, S must be fixed under rotation by 2k positions.

So, for example, if k=2, then 2k=4, so S must be fixed under rotation by 4. So, S is fixed under rotation by 4, which is the same as saying that S is composed of beads that are either fixed or form cycles under rotation by 4.

But wait, the only way a subset can be fixed under rotation by 4 is if it's a union of orbits under rotation by 4. The orbits under rotation by 4 in the octagon are the pairs {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}, {4,8}. So, each orbit is a pair, and S must be a union of some of these orbits.

But if S is fixed under rotation by 4, then S can only contain entire orbits. So, S could be any subset that is a union of entire orbits. Each orbit is size 2, so S must have an even number of elements. Since the octagon has 8 elements, S can be size 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

But in our case, S must have size 4 because we need |S| = |complement(S)|. So, S must consist of exactly two entire orbits. Since each orbit is size 2, two orbits give size 4.

So, the number of such subsets S is equal to the number of ways to choose two orbits out of four. That is, C(4,2) = 6. So, there are 6 subsets S of size 4 that are fixed under rotation by 4.

Wait, but earlier, I found 16 subsets where each pair has one blue and one red bead, which are fixed under rotation by 4. But this seems conflicting.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, when we have S fixed under rotation by 4, it can be any subset union of entire orbits. So, for example, S could be {1,5,2,6}, which is two orbits. Or S could be {1,5,3,7}, etc.

But when I considered the 16 subsets, that was when each pair must have exactly one blue and one red bead, which is a different condition. So, perhaps I confused two different concepts.

Wait, actually, perhaps the 16 subsets I was talking about earlier are those where S is not fixed under rotation by 4, but rather, S is equal to the complement of S rotated by 4. So, that would be a different condition.

Wait, let me clarify:

Case 1: S is fixed under rotation by k. So, r^k(S) = S. Then, S must be a union of orbits of size dividing k.

Case 2: S is mapped to its complement under rotation by k. So, r^k(S) = complement(S). Then, r^{2k}(S) = S.

So, the question is, how many subsets S satisfy r^k(S) = complement(S) for some k.

So, for each k from 1 to 7, we can look for subsets S such that applying rotation k to S gives the complement.

But considering that for each k, the number of such S may be different.

But maybe it's easier to consider all possible k and count the number of S for each k, then sum over k, but being cautious not to double-count.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find all such S by considering each possible rotation k and seeing what S must look like.

But maybe a better approach is to realize that the only possible k that can satisfy r^k(S) = complement(S) are those where 2k is a multiple of the group order, which is 8, so 2k ≡ 0 mod 8. Thus, k must be 4. Because 2*4=8≡0 mod 8. So, only rotation k=4 can satisfy r^k(S) = complement(S).

Wait, why? Because if r^k(S) = complement(S), then applying r^k again, we get r^{2k}(S) = S. So, S must be fixed under rotation by 2k. Therefore, 2k must be a multiple of the period of S. But the only way for this to hold for any S is if 2k is a multiple of 8, the group order. So, 2k ≡0 mod8, so k=4.

Therefore, the only rotation that can satisfy r^k(S) = complement(S) is k=4. Because for any other k, 2k would not be a multiple of 8, so S would have to be fixed under a rotation of order 2k, which is not possible for all S.

Wait, that makes sense. So, only rotation by 4 can satisfy r^4(S) = complement(S). Therefore, the only possible k is 4. So, the number of subsets S such that r^4(S) = complement(S) is equal to the number of subsets S where each orbit under rotation by 4 is split evenly between blue and red.

Which, as we saw earlier, requires that in each pair {i, i+4}, exactly one is blue and the other is red. So, each of the four pairs contributes one blue and one red. Therefore, the number of such subsets is 2^4 = 16, as we can choose either element in each pair to be blue.

Therefore, the number of subsets S of size 4 where S is a rotation of its complement (under rotation by 4) is 16.

Wait, but earlier, I thought each pair must have one blue and one red, which gives 16 subsets, each of size 4. But that's correct because each pair contributes exactly two possibilities: which one is blue. So, 2^4 = 16.

But wait, in the square case, all subsets of size 2 satisfied the condition, but in the octagon, only 16 subsets of size 4 satisfy the condition. So, the number of such subsets is 16.

Wait, but in the square, each subset of size 2 satisfies the condition because the rotation by 2 (which is 180 degrees) swaps each pair of opposite vertices. So, for each subset of size 2, the complement is a rotation by 2, hence it's a rotation of the subset.

But in the octagon, only when the subset is built by choosing exactly one from each of four independent pairs.

So, in the octagon, there are 16 such subsets S of size 4. Therefore, the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set is 16.

But wait, because each such subset S corresponds to a unique coloring where blue is S and red is its complement. So, each such subset S gives exactly one coloring. So, the total number of such colorings is 16.

Wait, but hold on, in the square case, each subset of size 2 corresponds to a unique coloring, and all 6 subsets of size 2 satisfy the condition. But in the octagon, only 16 subsets S of size 4 satisfy the condition.

But wait, no, in the square, each subset of size 2 does satisfy the condition. So, the number of colorings is 6. But in the octagon, the number is 16.

Wait, but 16 is only the number of subsets S where S is a rotation of its complement under rotation by 4. So, is that the only way? Or are there other subsets S that are rotations of their complements under different rotations?

Wait, earlier, I concluded that only rotation k=4 can satisfy r^k(S) = complement(S). Is that correct?

Wait, let's suppose that for some k, r^k(S) = complement(S). Then, r^{2k}(S) = S. So, S is fixed under rotation by 2k. Therefore, 2k must be a multiple of 8, so 2k ≡0 mod8, which implies k ≡4 mod8. So, the only possible k in 0 to 7 is k=4.

Therefore, the only rotation that can satisfy r^k(S) = complement(S) is k=4. Therefore, the only subsets S satisfying the condition are those for which S is a rotation of its complement under rotation by 4, which gives 16 subsets.

Therefore, the total number of such colorings is 16.

But wait, that seems low. Because in the square, it's 6 out of 16 colorings, but in the octagon, it's 16 out of 256 colorings. So, the probability is 16/256 = 1/16. So, m/n = 1/16, m + n = 17.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Because in the square, the number of subsets S of size 2 that are rotations of their complements is 6, which is half the number of subsets of size 2 (which is 6, so 6/16 is 3/8). But in the octagon, the number of subsets S of size 4 that are rotations of their complements is 16, as each pair contributes 2 choices, so 2^4=16.

But wait, let me check: Each rotation by 4 partitions the octagon into four independent pairs. For each pair, we can choose either element to be blue or red. So, for each pair, two choices, so 2^4=16. Each such choice gives a unique subset S of size 4. Therefore, there are 16 such subsets.

So, the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set is 16. Therefore, the probability is 16/256 = 1/16.

But let me consider another perspective. Perhaps some colorings are being counted multiple times because they might satisfy the condition for multiple rotations. But earlier, I concluded that only rotation by 4 can satisfy the condition, so each coloring is only counted once.

Wait, for example, suppose a coloring is symmetric under rotation by 4, which would mean that S is fixed under rotation by 4, i.e., S is a union of orbits under rotation by 4. But in that case, S would consist of entire pairs. So, for example, S could be {1,5,2,6}, which is fixed under rotation by 4. But such a subset S is not equal to its complement, which would be {3,7,4,8}. So, in this case, rotation by 4 maps S to its complement.

Wait, but {1,5,2,6} rotated by 4 gives {5,1,6,2}, which is the same as S, because S is fixed under rotation by 4. So, in this case, r^4(S) = S, not complement(S). So, such subsets are fixed under rotation by 4, but not equal to their complement.

Wait, so in this case, S is fixed under rotation by 4, but S is not equal to its complement. Therefore, such subsets do not satisfy r^4(S) = complement(S).

Wait, but earlier, I thought that S is equal to the complement of S rotated by 4. So, in order for S to be a rotation of its complement, we must have r^4(complement(S)) = S. Which implies that complement(S) rotated by 4 gives S.

Which is different from S being fixed under rotation by 4.

So, in this case, S is equal to the complement of S rotated by 4. So, S = r^4(complement(S)).

Which implies that complement(S) = r^{-4}(S). Since r^4 is its own inverse (because r^8 is the identity), so r^{-4} is the same as r^4.

So, S = r^4(complement(S)) => complement(S) = r^4(S).

Wait, that can't be, because if S = r^4(complement(S)), then complement(S) = r^4(S) only if r^4 is an involution, which it is, since r^8 is identity. So, applying r^4 twice gives identity.

Thus, the condition S = r^4(complement(S)) is equivalent to complement(S) = r^4(S). Which is the same as saying that S is equal to the complement of r^4(S). So, S is equal to the complement of its own rotation by 4.

So, in this case, S must be such that when you rotate it by 4, you get the complement.

So, for each such S, bead i is blue if and only if bead i+4 is red. So, for each i, bead i and bead i+4 must be different colors. So, S is a subset where exactly one of each pair {i, i+4} is blue.

Thus, for each of the four pairs, we choose exactly one to be blue. So, the number of such subsets is 2^4 = 16, as before.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is 16, each corresponding to a unique subset S.

Thus, the probability is 16/256 = 1/16. So, m=1, n=16, m +n=17.

Wait, but let me test with another example. Suppose all blue vertices are in one set that's fixed under rotation by 4. For example, S = {1,5,2,6}. Then, r^4(S) = S, so r^4(S) is not the complement of S. Therefore, such subsets S do not satisfy the condition, and hence are not counted in the 16 subsets. So, the only subsets that satisfy S = r^4(complement(S)) are those where each pair {i, i+4} has exactly one blue.

So, the count is indeed 16.

Therefore, the probability is 16/256 = 1/16, so m + n = 1 + 16 = 17.

Wait, but in the square, as a check, all subsets of size 2 satisfy the condition, and that's 6 subsets, which is 6/16=3/8. So, in the square, the probability is 3/8.

But in the octagon, it's 1/16. That seems quite low, but considering that the octagon has more structure, maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed some colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set under a rotation other than 4. But earlier, I concluded that only k=4 can satisfy the condition because otherwise, 2k wouldn't be a multiple of 8.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose there exists a subset S such that r^k(S) = complement(S) for some k not equal to 4.

Then, as before, r^{2k}(S) = S.

So, S must be fixed under rotation by 2k. So, 2k must be a multiple of the order of the rotation, which is 8. So, 2k ≡0 mod8.

So, k must be 4 mod8. So, the only possible k in 0 to7 is k=4.

Therefore, no other k can satisfy the condition. So, the only subsets S that satisfy S = r^k(complement(S)) are those for k=4.

So, that confirms that the only such subsets are the 16 we've already considered.

Therefore, the probability is indeed 16/256 = 1/16. So, the answer is 1 +16=17.


The problem involves determining the probability that a regular octagon, with each vertex colored red or blue independently, can be rotated such that all blue vertices align with originally red vertices. 

To solve this, we need to count the number of subsets \( S \) of the octagon's vertices where \( S \) is a rotation of its complement. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, and the total number of possible colorings is \( 2^8 = 256 \).

For \( S \) to be a rotation of its complement, it must satisfy \( r^k(S) = \text{complement}(S) \) for some rotation \( k \). Applying \( r^k \) twice gives \( r^{2k}(S) = S \), meaning \( S \) must be fixed under rotation by \( 2k \). Since the octagon has 8 vertices, \( 2k \) must be a multiple of 8, implying \( k = 4 \).

Thus, \( S \) must be such that rotating it by 4 positions results in its complement. This requires that for each pair of diametrically opposite vertices, exactly one is blue and the other is red. There are 4 such independent pairs, each contributing 2 choices (which vertex to color blue). Therefore, the number of valid subsets \( S \) is \( 2^4 = 16 \).

The probability is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings:
\[
\frac{16}{256} = \frac{1}{16}
\]
Thus, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 16 \), leading to \( m + n = 17 \).
