Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It says:

Let \( N \) be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let \( Q \) and \( R \) be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when \( N \) is divided by 1000. Find \( Q + R \).

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, \( N \) is a four-digit number. So, it's between 1000 and 9999. We need the greatest such number, so we should aim for the largest possible number that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), if we replace that digit with 1, the new number must be divisible by 7.

My goal is to find the largest such \( N \), then compute \( Q = N / 1000 \) (the quotient, which is the thousands digit), and \( R = N \% 1000 \) (the remainder, which is the last three digits), and then sum \( Q + R \).

Let me think about how to approach this.

Since \( N \) is the greatest four-digit number, I should start from 9999 and work my way down, checking each number to see if it satisfies the condition. But that might take too long because checking each number manually isn't efficient. So, perhaps I can find some patterns or mathematical properties that will help.

First, let me denote the digits of \( N \) as \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), \( d \), where \( a \) is the thousands digit, \( b \) the hundreds, \( c \) the tens, and \( d \) the units digit. So, \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).

The condition is that changing any digit to 1 yields a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 gives a multiple of 7.

Let me write down the four conditions:

1. Changing \( a \) to 1: \( 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d \) must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing \( b \) to 1: \( 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d \) must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing \( c \) to 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d \) must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing \( d \) to 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \) must be divisible by 7.

So, four conditions. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. Let me denote these as:

1. \( N_1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \)
2. \( N_2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \)
3. \( N_3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \)
4. \( N_4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \)

Each \( N_i \) must be divisible by 7.

So, perhaps I can express these conditions in modular arithmetic terms.

Let me think about each condition modulo 7.

First, let's express each \( N_i \) in terms of \( N \). But wait, when you change a digit, you're altering a specific part of the number. Let me try to express each \( N_i \) in terms of \( N \) and the change.

But maybe it's better to write each \( N_i \) as:

1. \( N_1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + (N - 1000a) \)
Because \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), so \( N - 1000a = 100b + 10c + d \). So, \( N_1 = 1000 + (N - 1000a) \).

Similarly, \( N_2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + (N - 1000a - 100) \)? Wait, that might not be the easiest way.

Alternatively, let's compute \( N_1 \) modulo 7.

We can write \( N_1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \).

Similarly for the others:

1. \( N_1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
2. \( N_2 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
3. \( N_3 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
4. \( N_4 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

So, let's compute each \( N_i \) modulo 7.

First, let me compute the modulus of the original number \( N \) modulo 7. Let me denote \( N \mod 7 = k \), where \( k \) is between 0 and 6.

But since each \( N_i \) is obtained by changing one digit to 1, perhaps I can relate each \( N_i \) to \( N \) and find expressions for \( k \).

Let me consider each case one by one.

1. Changing the thousands digit to 1:

\( N_1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \)

But \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), so \( N_1 = 1000 - 1000a + N \).

So, \( N_1 = N - 1000(a - 1) \). Hmm, but that might not be the most helpful way.

Alternatively, \( N_1 = 1000 + (N - 1000a) \).

Wait, perhaps in terms of modulus 7:

We can compute \( N_1 \mod 7 \) by calculating each component modulo 7.

Let me compute the modulus of each digit position.

First, 1000 mod 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7: 3.

1 mod 7: 1.

So, for \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), then:

\( N \mod 7 = (6a + 2b + 3c + d) \mod 7 \).

Similarly, let's compute each \( N_i \) mod 7.

1. \( N_1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \).

So, \( N_1 \mod 7 = (6*1 + 2b + 3c + d) \mod 7 \), since 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7, and 1 in thousands place is 1*6.

Wait, no. Wait, 1000 is 1 in thousands place, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each digit's contribution.

Wait, in \( N_1 \), the thousands digit is 1, so its contribution is 1*6 mod 7.

The hundreds digit is b, so 2b mod7.

Tens digit is c, 3c mod7.

Units digit is d, d mod7.

So, \( N_1 \mod7 = (6*1 + 2b + 3c + d) \mod7 \).

Similarly, \( N \mod7 = (6a + 2b + 3c + d) \mod7 \).

So, \( N_1 \mod7 = (6 + 2b + 3c + d) \mod7 = (6 + (2b + 3c + d)) \mod7 \).

But \( N \mod7 = (6a + 2b + 3c + d) \mod7 \).

So, let me set \( N_1 \mod7 = 0 \):

\( 6 + (2b + 3c + d) \equiv 0 \mod7 \).

But \( 2b + 3c + d \equiv (-6) \mod7 \).

But from \( N \mod7 = 6a + (2b + 3c + d) \equiv k \mod7 \).

So, \( 2b + 3c + d \equiv k -6a \mod7 \).

Substituting back into \( N_1 \) condition:

\( 6 + (k -6a) \equiv 0 \mod7 \).

Which implies:

\( 6 + k -6a ≡0 \mod7 \).

But \( k = N \mod7 \), so \( 6 + (N \mod7) -6a ≡0 mod7 \).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.

Wait, maybe I can express each condition in terms of \( N \mod7 \).

Let me try that.

Let me denote \( N \mod7 = r \), so \( r = (6a + 2b + 3c + d) \mod7 \).

Then, from the first condition for \( N_1 \):

\( N_1 \mod7 = (6*1 + 2b + 3c + d) \mod7 = (6 + (2b +3c +d)) \mod7 = (6 + (r -6a)) \mod7 \).

Because \( 2b +3c +d = r -6a \mod7 \).

So, \( N_1 \mod7 = (6 + r -6a) \mod7 \equiv 0 \mod7 \).

So,

\( 6 + r -6a ≡0 \mod7 \).

Similarly, let's process the other conditions.

Condition 2: Changing hundreds digit to 1.

\( N_2 = 1000a + 100*1 +10c + d \).

Compute \( N_2 \mod7 \):

1000a ≡6a, 100 ≡2, 10c≡3c, d≡d.

So, \( N_2 \mod7 = (6a + 2*1 + 3c + d) \mod7 \) = (6a + 2 + 3c + d) mod7.

But \(3c + d = (r -6a -2b) \mod7\) from the original \( N \mod7 \).

Wait, original \( N \mod7 =6a +2b +3c +d =r \).

So, \(3c +d = r -6a -2b \mod7\).

Substituting into \( N_2 \mod7 \):

\(6a + 2 + (r -6a -2b) \mod7 \).

Simplify:

6a cancels with -6a.

So, \(2 + r -2b ≡0 mod7\).

So, \( r -2b +2 ≡0 mod7 \).

That's equation 2.

Similarly, condition3: changing tens digit to 1.

\( N_3 = 1000a + 100b +10*1 +d \).

Compute \( N_3 mod7 \):

1000a ≡6a, 100b≡2b, 10≡3, d≡d.

So, \(6a +2b +3 +d mod7 ≡0 \).

Again, from original \( N mod7 =6a +2b +3c +d =r \).

So, \(3c +d = r -6a -2b mod7\).

So, \(6a +2b +3 +d mod7 = 6a + 2b +3 + (r -6a -2b) mod7 \).

Simplify:

6a -6a cancels, 2b -2b cancels.

So, 3 + r mod7 ≡0.

So, \( r +3 ≡0 mod7 \).

So, equation3: \( r ≡ -3 mod7 \) or \( r ≡4 mod7 \).

Condition4: changing units digit to1.

\( N_4 = 1000a + 100b +10c +1 \).

Compute \( N_4 mod7 \):

1000a≡6a, 100b≡2b,10c≡3c,1≡1.

So, \(6a +2b +3c +1 mod7 ≡0 \).

From original, \(6a +2b +3c +d =r mod7\).

So, \(6a +2b +3c = r -d mod7\).

Substituting into \( N_4 mod7 \):

\( (r -d) +1 ≡0 mod7 \).

So, \( r -d +1 ≡0 mod7 \).

Thus, equation4: \( r -d +1 ≡0 mod7 \) → \( r -d ≡ -1 mod7 \) → \( r ≡ d -1 mod7 \).

So, summarizing the four conditions:

1. \(6 + r -6a ≡0 mod7 \) → \( r ≡6a -6 mod7 \).
2. \( r -2b +2 ≡0 mod7 \) → \( r ≡2b -2 mod7 \).
3. \( r +3 ≡0 mod7 \) → \( r ≡4 mod7 \).
4. \( r ≡d -1 mod7 \).

From condition3, we immediately get \( r =4 \) mod7. So, \( r =4 \).

So, from condition3, \( r=4 \).

Now, from condition1: \( 4 ≡6a -6 mod7 \).

So, \(6a ≡4 +6 mod7 → 6a≡10 mod7 → 10 mod7 is 3 → 6a≡3 mod7.

We can write this as \(6a ≡3 mod7\). Let's solve for a.

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse of6 is6.

Thus, a≡3*6 mod7 → a≡18 mod7 →18 mod7 is4, so a≡4 mod7.

But a is a digit from1 to9 (since it's the thousands digit of a four-digit number). So, a can be 4 or 11, but 11 is invalid, so a=4.

So, a=4.

From condition2: \(4 ≡2b -2 mod7 → 2b ≡4 +2 mod7 →2b≡6 mod7→b≡3 mod7 (since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, inverse of2 is4).

So, b=3 or b=10, but b is a digit (0-9). So, b=3.

From condition4: \(4 ≡d -1 mod7 →d≡5 mod7.

d is a digit, so possible d=5 or d=12, but d=5 only.

So, d=5.

Now, so far, we have a=4, b=3, d=5. We need to find c.

From the original equation: \( r =4 ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7 \).

Plugging in a=4, b=3, d=5:

\(6*4 +2*3 +3c +5 ≡ r=4 mod7\).

Compute:

6*4=24, 24 mod7=3.

2*3=6, 6 mod7=6.

3c mod7=3c.

5 mod7=5.

So,

3 +6 +3c +5 ≡4 mod7.

Sum: 3+6=9, 9+5=14.

14 +3c ≡4 mod7.

14 mod7=0, so 0 +3c ≡4 mod7 → 3c≡4 mod7.

Solve for c:

3c≡4 mod7.

The inverse of 3 mod7 is5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by5:

c≡4*5=20≡6 mod7.

So, c=6 or c=13, but c is a digit, so c=6.

So, c=6.

Thus, the number N is a=4, b=3, c=6, d=5 → N=4365.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is this the greatest possible four-digit number?

Because 4365 is 4365, but perhaps there's a higher number with a=4, but higher digits in lower places? Wait, but given the conditions, a=4, b=3, c=6, d=5. So, 4365.

But let me check if this is indeed the maximum. Because perhaps, if we have a=4, but higher b, c, or d, but such that when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7.

Wait, but from the equations, the digits are uniquely determined as a=4, b=3, c=6, d=5.

But that seems too restrictive. Let me check if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's go through the equations again.

From condition1:

6 + r -6a ≡0 mod7.

We found r=4.

So, 6 +4 -6a ≡0 mod7 → 10 -6a ≡0 mod7 → 10 mod7 is3, so 3 -6a ≡0 mod7 → -6a ≡-3 mod7 → 6a ≡3 mod7.

Which leads to a=4 as before.

Similarly, condition2: r=4, so 4 -2b +2 ≡0 →6 -2b≡0 mod7 →2b≡6 mod7 →b≡3 mod7, so b=3.

Condition3: r=4.

Condition4: r=4, so 4 ≡d -1 mod7 → d=5.

So, yes, a=4, b=3, d=5.

Then, from the original N mod7=4.

Compute 6a +2b +3c +d mod7:

6*4=24≡3, 2*3=6, 3c, d=5≡5.

So, 3+6 +3c +5 ≡4 mod7 →14 +3c ≡4 mod7.

14≡0, so 3c≡4 mod7 →c≡6 mod7.

So, c=6.

Thus, N=4365.

But wait, is 4365 the largest possible four-digit number with this property?

Wait, perhaps not. Because maybe there's a higher N where a=4, but b, c, d are higher, but still satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but according to the equations, the digits are uniquely determined. So, a=4, b=3, c=6, d=5 is the only solution.

But wait, that can't be. Because if you change digits, maybe you can have higher digits but still satisfy the modular conditions.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Let me think again. The digits are uniquely determined by the conditions, but perhaps I can have higher digits if I adjust other digits appropriately.

Wait, but in the equations, each condition gives us a unique equation, so the digits are uniquely determined.

Wait, let's check the four-digit number 4365.

Let me verify whether changing any digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

Compute:

1. Change thousands digit to1: 1365.

Is 1365 divisible by7? Let's check.

7*195=1365. Yes, because 7*190=1330, 7*5=35, 1330+35=1365. So yes.

2. Change hundreds digit to1: 4165.

Is 4165 divisible by7? Let's compute 4165/7.

7*595=4165. Because 7*500=3500, 7*90=630, 7*5=35. 3500+630=4130, +35=4165. So yes.

3. Change tens digit to1: 4315.

Is 4315 divisible by7? Let's compute 4315/7.

7*616=4312. 4315-4312=3. So, remainder3. Not divisible. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, that's a problem. So, 4315 is not divisible by7. So, N=4365 doesn't satisfy the condition when we change the tens digit to1.

So, that means my earlier conclusion was wrong. So, my approach must have a mistake.

Wait, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the modular equations.

Let me double-check the computations.

So, when I computed condition3: changing the tens digit.

I think I may have made an error in how I related the modulus.

Wait, let me re-examine condition3.

Condition3: changing tens digit to1.

So, \( N_3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d \).

Compute \( N_3 mod7 \).

Earlier, I said \( N_3 mod7 =6a +2b +3 +d mod7 \).

But wait, 10*1 is 10, which is 3 mod7. So, yes.

But then, I tried to express this in terms of the original N's modulus.

Original N mod7: \(6a +2b +3c +d = r=4 mod7\).

So, \(6a +2b +3c +d=4 mod7\).

Thus, in \( N_3 mod7=6a +2b +3 +d mod7 \).

Which can be written as \( (6a +2b +3c +d) -3c +3 mod7 \).

Which is \( r -3c +3 mod7 \).

Since \( r=4 \), it's \(4 -3c +3 mod7 =7 -3c mod7 → 0 -3c mod7 → -3c mod7 \).

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps this is where I messed up.

Wait, let me recompute condition3.

\( N_3 mod7 =6a +2b +3*1 +d mod7 =6a +2b +3 +d mod7.

But 6a +2b +d is part of the original N mod7.

Original N mod7: 6a +2b +3c +d=4 mod7.

So, 6a +2b +d=4 -3c mod7.

So, \( N_3 mod7 = (4 -3c) +3 mod7 =7 -3c mod7=0 -3c mod7= -3c mod7.

And this must be ≡0 mod7.

So, \( -3c ≡0 mod7 → 3c≡0 mod7 → c≡0 mod7.

Because 3 and7 are coprime, so c must be≡0 mod7.

But c is a digit, so c=0 or7.

So, c=0 or7.

Wait, this is different from what I had before. So, my earlier conclusion that c=6 was incorrect. Instead, c must be0 or7.

So, that changes things. So, that suggests that my earlier approach was flawed because I didn't correctly compute condition3.

So, let's redo the analysis.

Given condition3: \( -3c ≡0 mod7 \) → c≡0 mod7.

So, c can be0 or7.

So, c=0 or7.

So, let's re-examine the equations with this in mind.

We still have:

From condition1: r=4, a=4.

From condition2: r=4, b=3.

From condition4: d=5.

From condition3: c=0 or7.

So, now, let's find c.

From the original N mod7=4.

Compute: \(6a +2b +3c +d ≡4 mod7\).

Plug in a=4, b=3, d=5:

6*4=24≡3 mod7.

2*3=6 mod7.

3c mod7.

5 mod7=5.

So, 3 +6 +3c +5 ≡4 mod7.

Sum: 3+6=9≡2 mod7. 2+5=7≡0 mod7.

So, 0 +3c ≡4 mod7 →3c≡4 mod7.

So, 3c≡4 mod7.

Inverse of3 mod7 is5, so c≡4*5=20≡6 mod7.

But earlier we found c must be0 or7, which is 0 or7 mod7.

But 6≡6 mod7, which is neither0 nor7.

That's a contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that my earlier conclusion is conflicting with condition3.

So, this is confusing.

Wait, let's go back.

When I computed condition3, I concluded that c must be0 or7.

But from the original N mod7 equation, I get c≡6 mod7.

This is a contradiction.

Which suggests that our earlier reasoning has a mistake.

Wait, perhaps condition3 is not correctly derived.

Let me re-examine condition3.

Condition3: Changing tens digit c to1, so the number becomes \( N_3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d \).

Compute \( N_3 mod7 \):

1000a ≡6a mod7.

100b≡2b mod7.

10*1≡3 mod7.

d≡d mod7.

So, \( N_3 ≡6a +2b +3 +d mod7 \).

But from the original N, \( N ≡6a +2b +3c +d ≡4 mod7 \).

So, \(6a +2b +d ≡4 -3c mod7 \).

Substitute into \( N_3 mod7 \):

\( N_3 ≡ (4 -3c) +3 mod7 =7 -3c mod7=0 -3c mod7= -3c mod7 \).

So, \( N_3 ≡ -3c mod7 \).

For \( N_3 \) to be divisible by7, this must be≡0 mod7.

Thus, \( -3c ≡0 mod7 →3c≡0 mod7 →c≡0 mod7 \).

So, c must be0 or7.

So, c=0 or7.

Now, from the original N mod7 equation:

\(6a +2b +3c +d ≡4 mod7 \).

We have a=4, b=3, d=5.

So, 6*4=24≡3; 2*3=6≡6; 3c; d=5≡5.

So,

3 +6 +3c +5 ≡4 mod7.

Compute 3+6=9≡2; 2+5=7≡0.

So, 0 +3c ≡4 mod7 →3c≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by5 (inverse of3 is5): c≡4*5=20≡6 mod7.

But c must be0 or7. That's a contradiction because c must be≡6 mod7 but also≡0 mod7.

This suggests that no solution exists with a=4, b=3, d=5, c=0 or7.

Hmm, that's a problem.

So, maybe my earlier assumption that a=4 is incorrect.

Wait, earlier, from condition1:

6a ≡3 mod7 →a≡4 mod7.

But in the problem, a is the thousands digit, so a can be 1 to9.

So, a=4 or a=11, but11 is invalid, so a=4.

So, a=4 is fixed.

So, that seems inescapable.

But then c must be6 mod7, but condition3 requires c=0 or7.

So, how can both be true?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in condition3.

Let me think again.

Condition3: changing tens digit to1, so N_3=1000a+100b+10*1 +d.

Compute N_3 mod7:

1000a≡6a,

100b≡2b,

10*1≡3,

d≡d.

So, N_3≡6a +2b +3 +d mod7.

But from N mod7=6a +2b +3c +d=4 mod7.

Thus, 6a +2b +d=4 -3c mod7.

So, N_3≡(4 -3c) +3 mod7=7 -3c mod7=0 -3c mod7= -3c mod7.

Thus, -3c≡0 mod7 →3c≡0 mod7→c≡0 mod7.

So, c must be0 or7.

But from original equation, 3c≡4 mod7→c≡6 mod7.

So, 6 mod7≠0 mod7.

Contradiction.

This suggests that my initial approach is wrong.

Therefore, perhaps there is no such number N=4365, because changing the tens digit to1 gives a number not divisible by7.

Which means my earlier conclusion was wrong.

So, perhaps, I need to approach the problem differently.

Alternative approach:

Instead of trying to model the equations, perhaps I can think about the four numbers obtained by changing each digit to1.

Each of these four numbers is divisible by7.

So, N must be such that N - (digit in position x)*10^x +1*10^x is divisible by7 for each x=1,2,3,4.

Wait, perhaps not exactly, but the idea is that when you change a digit, you subtract the original digit and add1, multiplied by the place value.

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote the four-digit number as N=abcd, where a,b,c,d are digits, a≠0.

Changing the thousands digit to1: N1=1bcd=1000 +100b +10c +d.

Similarly, N2= a1cd=100a +10c +d +100.

Wait, perhaps better to think of the change as:

N1 = N - a*1000 +1*1000.

Similarly, N2 = N - b*100 +1*100.

N3 = N - c*10 +1*10.

N4 = N - d*1 +1*1.

Each N_i must be divisible by7.

Thus, N_i = N - (digit)*place + place*1.

So, for N1: N1 = N - a*1000 +1*1000.

Similarly, N2 = N - b*100 +1*100.

N3 = N - c*10 +1*10.

N4 = N - d*1 +1*1.

Each N_i must be divisible by7.

So, N1 ≡0 mod7 → N - a*1000 +1000 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly,

N2 ≡0 mod7 → N - b*100 +100 ≡0 mod7.

N3 ≡0 mod7 → N - c*10 +10 ≡0 mod7.

N4 ≡0 mod7 → N -d +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four congruences:

1. N - a*1000 +1000 ≡0 mod7 → N ≡(a*1000 -1000) mod7.

But 1000 mod7=6, so:

N ≡ (a*6 -6) mod7.

Which is N≡6(a -1) mod7.

2. N -b*100 +100 ≡0 mod7 → N ≡(b*100 -100) mod7.

100 mod7=2, so:

N≡(b*2 -2) mod7.

3. N -c*10 +10 ≡0 mod7 → N≡(c*10 -10) mod7.

10 mod7=3, so:

N≡(c*3 -3) mod7.

4. N -d +1 ≡0 mod7 → N≡(d -1) mod7.

So, now we have four congruences:

1. N ≡6(a -1) mod7.

2. N ≡2(b -1) mod7.

3. N ≡3(c -1) mod7.

4. N ≡(d -1) mod7.

Additionally, from the original N mod7, we have:

N ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

So, we have four expressions for N mod7:

1. 6(a-1) mod7.

2. 2(b-1) mod7.

3. 3(c-1) mod7.

4. (d-1) mod7.

And also, N mod7=6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

So, all these expressions must equal N mod7.

So, equate each to N mod7:

1. 6(a -1) ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

2. 2(b -1) ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

3. 3(c -1) ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

4. (d -1) ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

Let me write each equation:

1. 6a -6 ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

Simplify: subtract 6a both sides.

-6 ≡2b +3c +d mod7.

2. 2b -2 ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

Subtract 2b both sides: -2 ≡6a +3c +d mod7.

3. 3c -3 ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

Subtract3c: -3 ≡6a +2b +d mod7.

4. d -1 ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

Subtract d: -1 ≡6a +2b +3c mod7.

So, now we have four equations:

1. -6 ≡2b +3c +d mod7 → 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7).

2. -2 ≡6a +3c +d mod7 →6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 (since -2 ≡5 mod7).

3. -3 ≡6a +2b +d mod7 →6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7).

4. -1 ≡6a +2b +3c mod7 →6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 ≡6 mod7).

So, now we have four equations:

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

And we also have the original:

Equation5:6a +2b +3c +d ≡N mod7.

Wait, not sure if we need equation5 anymore.

So, let's try to solve these equations step by step.

Let me write down the four equations:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. (eq1)

2. 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7. (eq2)

3. 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7. (eq3)

4. 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. (eq4)

Let me try to subtract eq3 from eq2:

eq2 - eq3:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) ≡5 -4 mod7.

Simplify:

(0a) +3c -2b +0d ≡1 mod7.

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7. (eq6)

Similarly, subtract eq3 from eq4:

eq4 - eq3:

(6a +2b +3c) - (6a +2b +d) ≡6 -4 mod7.

Simplify:

0a +0b +3c -d ≡2 mod7.

So, 3c -d ≡2 mod7. (eq7)

Now, from eq1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

From eq7: 3c -d ≡2 mod7 → d ≡3c -2 mod7.

Substitute d into eq1:

2b +3c + (3c -2) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

2b +6c -2 ≡1 mod7.

So, 2b +6c ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by common factor if possible.

Note that 2 and7 are coprime, so can multiply both sides by inverse of2 mod7, which is4.

Multiply:

(2b +6c)*4 ≡3*4 mod7.

Compute:

8b +24c ≡12 mod7.

Simplify:

8b ≡1b mod7, 24c≡3c mod7, 12≡5 mod7.

So, b +3c ≡5 mod7. (eq8)

From eq6: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

So, we have:

eq6: 3c -2b ≡1.

eq8: b +3c ≡5.

Let me write them:

3c -2b ≡1. (eq6)

3c +b ≡5. (eq8)

Let me subtract eq6 from eq8:

(3c +b) - (3c -2b) ≡5 -1 mod7.

Simplify:

3c +b -3c +2b ≡4 mod7.

So, 3b ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of3 mod7, which is5.

So, b≡4*5=20≡6 mod7.

Thus, b=6 or b=13, but b is a digit, so b=6.

So, b=6.

Now, from eq8: 3c +6 ≡5 mod7 →3c≡5 -6 mod7→3c≡-1≡6 mod7.

So, 3c≡6 mod7→c≡2 mod7 (since 3*2=6≡6 mod7).

So, c=2 or c=9 (since c is a digit, 0-9).

So, c=2 or9.

Now, from eq7:3c -d≡2 mod7.

Case1: c=2.

Then, 3*2 -d ≡2 mod7 →6 -d≡2→-d≡-4 mod7→d≡4 mod7.

So, d=4 or11, but d is a digit, so d=4.

Case2: c=9.

3*9=27≡6 mod7.

So, 6 -d≡2 mod7 →-d≡-4→d≡4 mod7.

So, d=4 or11, but d is a digit, so d=4.

Thus, in both cases, d=4.

So, now, we have b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

Now, let's find a.

From eq2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Case1: c=2, d=4.

Then, 6a +3*2 +4 ≡5 mod7→6a +6 +4 ≡5→6a +10≡5 mod7.

10 mod7=3, so 6a +3≡5→6a≡2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of6 mod7, which is6.

So, a≡2*6=12≡5 mod7.

So, a=5 or12, but a is a digit, so a=5.

Case2: c=9, d=4.

Compute eq2:

6a +3*9 +4 ≡5 mod7.

3*9=27≡6 mod7.

4 mod7=4.

So, 6a +6 +4 ≡5→6a +10≡5 mod7.

10 mod7=3, so 6a +3≡5→6a≡2 mod7.

Same as before: a≡5 mod7.

So, a=5 or12, but a=5.

Thus, a=5.

Thus, in both cases, a=5.

So, now, we have a=5, b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

So, two possibilities:

1. N=5 6 2 4 →5624.

2. N=5 6 9 4 →5694.

Now, let's check which one is larger. 5694 is larger than5624.

But we need the greatest four-digit number, so N=5694.

Wait, but let me check if N=5694 satisfies all four conditions.

Let's compute each N_i:

1. Change thousands digit to1:1694.

Check if1694 divisible by7.

7*242=1694. Yes, because 7*240=1680, 7*2=14. 1680+14=1694. So yes.

2. Change hundreds digit to1:5194.

Check divisibility by7.

Compute 5194 /7.

7*742=5194. Because 7*700=4900, 7*40=280, 7*2=14.

4900+280=5180, +14=5194. So yes.

3. Change tens digit to1:5614.

Check divisibility by7.

Compute 5614/7.

7*802=5614. 7*800=5600, 7*2=14. 5600+14=5614. So yes.

4. Change units digit to1:5691.

Check divisibility by7.

Compute 5691/7.

7*813=5691. Because 7*800=5600, 7*13=91. 5600+91=5691. So yes.

So, N=5694 satisfies all conditions.

But wait, is 5694 the largest possible?

Wait, perhaps there's a larger number with a=5, but higher digits in b, c, d.

Wait, but from the equations, the digits are uniquely determined as a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

So, N=5694 is the maximum possible.

Wait, but earlier when I thought a=4, b=3, c=6, d=5, which didn't work when changing tens digit. So, this suggests that the correct N is5694.

But let me check if there's a larger four-digit number. For example, 5694 is a four-digit number, but maybe 5695 or higher could also satisfy the conditions.

But 5695 is larger than5694. Let's check if it satisfies the condition.

Wait, but according to our equations, the digits are uniquely determined once a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

So, any larger number would have a higher digit in thousands, hundreds, tens, or units place, but according to the equations, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum possible.

Wait, unless there's another solution with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, but with higher digits.

But no, because d is already 4, which is the maximum possible for d=4 in that case.

Wait, but let me think: could there be another number with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4? That's the only possible number from the equations.

So, 5694 is the maximum.

So, N=5694.

Thus, Q is the quotient when N is divided by1000, which is floor(N/1000)=5.

R is the remainder when N is divided by1000, which is N mod1000=694.

Thus, Q=5, R=694.

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

Thus, the answer is699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's denote the digits of \( N \) as \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \), where \( a \) is the thousands digit, \( b \) the hundreds, \( c \) the tens, and \( d \) the units digit. Thus, \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).

We analyze the conditions by considering the impact of changing each digit to 1 and ensuring the resulting number is divisible by 7. Using modular arithmetic, we derive the following key steps:

1. **Changing the thousands digit to 1**: The resulting number must be divisible by 7.
2. **Changing the hundreds digit to 1**: The resulting number must be divisible by 7.
3. **Changing the tens digit to 1**: The resulting number must be divisible by 7.
4. **Changing the units digit to 1**: The resulting number must be divisible by 7.

By setting up and solving the modular equations for each condition, we find that the digits of \( N \) must satisfy specific congruences. After thorough analysis, we determine that the digits are uniquely determined as \( a = 5 \), \( b = 6 \), \( c = 9 \), and \( d = 4 \). Thus, the number \( N \) is 5694.

To find \( Q \) and \( R \):
- \( Q \) is the quotient when \( N \) is divided by 1000, which is \( \lfloor 5694 / 1000 \rfloor = 5 \).
- \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000, which is \( 5694 \mod 1000 = 694 \).

Therefore, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

\boxed{699}
