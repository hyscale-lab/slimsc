Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. Since it's the greatest such number, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find the one that satisfies the condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the resulting number should be a multiple of 7.

Let me think about the structure of N. Let's denote N as a four-digit number, so N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero.

So, when I replace A with 1, I get 1BCD. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, replacing C with 1 gives AB1D, and replacing D with 1 gives ABC1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, the four conditions are:

1. 1BCD is divisible by 7.
2. A1CD is divisible by 7.
3. AB1D is divisible by 7.
4. ABC1 is divisible by 7.

My goal is to find the largest N = ABCD such that all four of these are true.

Since I'm looking for the largest N, starting from 9999 and going down makes sense, but that might take a long time. Maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each of these modified numbers in terms of N and the digit being changed.

Wait, let's consider each case:

1. When replacing A with 1: The new number is 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Since N is ABCD, which is 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D. So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D equals N - 1000*A + 1000.

Wait, maybe that's not the easiest way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the modified numbers as:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D: When A is replaced by 1.
2. 100A + 100 + 10C + D: When B is replaced by 1.
3. 100A + 10B + 10 + D: When C is replaced by 1.
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1: When D is replaced by 1.

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, for each i from 1 to 4, modified_N_i ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, maybe I can write equations for each condition:

Let me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Then:

- 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
- 100A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
- 100A + 10B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
- 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, I can write each of these in terms of N.

Wait, maybe express each modified number in terms of N and the digit change.

Let me see:

1. When A is changed to 1: (N - 1000A) + 1000 = N - 1000A + 1000. So, N - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Since N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D,

N - 1000A + 1000 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D - 1000A + 1000 = 100B + 10C + D + 1000.

Which is 1BCD as a number.

Similarly, for the other cases:

2. Changing B to 1: N - 100B + 100 = (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) -100B +100 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Which is A1CD.

3. Changing C to 1: N - 10C +10 = 1000A + 100B + (10C + D) -10C +10 = 1000A + 100B +10 + D.

Which is AB1D.

4. Changing D to 1: N - D + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D - D + 1 = 1000A + 100B +10C +1.

Which is ABC1.

So, each of these four expressions must be divisible by 7.

So, I can write:

1. 100B + 10C + D + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C +1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, perhaps I can express these in terms of N. Let me think.

N is 1000A + 100B +10C + D.

So, for the first condition:

100B +10C + D = (1000A + 100B +10C + D) - 1000A = N -1000A.

So, 100B +10C + D + 1000 = N -1000A +1000.

Thus, N -1000A +1000 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, condition 2:

1000A + 100 +10C + D = N - (100B) +100.

So, N -100B +100 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, condition 3:

1000A +100B +10 + D = N -10C +10.

So, N -10C +10 ≡0 mod7.

Condition 4:

1000A +100B +10C +1 = N - D +1.

So, N - D +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, now we have four congruences:

1. N -1000A +1000 ≡0 mod7
2. N -100B +100 ≡0 mod7
3. N -10C +10 ≡0 mod7
4. N - D +1 ≡0 mod7

Hmm, perhaps I can write N in terms of these.

Wait, but N is 1000A + 100B +10C + D.

Let me see each equation:

1. N -1000A +1000 ≡0 mod7.
Plugging N =1000A +100B +10C + D,
