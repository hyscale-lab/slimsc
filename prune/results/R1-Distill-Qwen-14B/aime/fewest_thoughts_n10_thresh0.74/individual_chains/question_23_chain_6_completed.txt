Okay, so I have this hyperbola equation: (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, let me recall. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles if it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. No, actually, no. Wait, I might be confusing with a kite. Let me check. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait no, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, diagonals intersect at right angles.

Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other but aren't perpendicular unless it's a square. So, in a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular but not necessarily equal. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.

So, the rhombus is such that its diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint of both AC and BD.

Given that, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola. Let me think about the coordinates of these points.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

So, points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q). These four points form a rhombus. So, all sides are equal: AB = BC = CD = DA.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me consider vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin.

Wait, another thought: since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they bisect each other at the origin, and they are perpendicular. Because in a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.

Wait, but let me confirm that. If the diagonals are AC and BD, then their slopes should be negative reciprocals because they are perpendicular.

So, slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x.

Similarly, slope of BD is (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p.

Since they're perpendicular, (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (yq)/(xp) = -1.

So, yq = -xp.

Hmm, that's a condition.

Now, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so for point A(x, y): (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1.

Similarly for point B(p, q): (p²)/20 - (q²)/24 = 1.

So, we have four points with these coordinates.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, distance AB = distance BC = distance CD = distance DA.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use vectors. Let's represent the points as vectors from the origin. So, vector OA is (x, y), OB is (p, q), OC is (-x, -y), OD is (-p, -q).

In a rhombus, the sides can be represented as vectors OB - OA, OC - OB, etc. But maybe it's better to look at the condition that all sides are equal in length.

So, |B - A| = |C - B| = |D - C| = |A - D|.

But perhaps an alternative approach is considering that in a rhombus, adjacent sides are equal and the adjacent sides are vectors from the same point.

Wait, maybe using vectors OA and OB, and since the diagonals are AC and BD, which are 2OA and 2OB? Wait, no, AC is from A to C, which is (-x, -y) - (x, y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D: (-p, -q) - (p, q) = (-2p, -2q). So, the diagonals are vectors AC = (-2x, -2y) and BD = (-2p, -2q). But their midpoints are at the origin, as the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other.

But since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.

So, AC ⋅ BD = 0.

Which would be (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq = 0.

Divide both sides by 4: xp + yq = 0.

Which gives us the same condition as before: yq = -xp, or xp + yq = 0.

So, that's our condition from the perpendicular diagonals.

Now, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Similarly, for point B: p²/20 - q²/24 =1.

So, we have these two equations:

1) x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

2) p²/20 - q²/24 =1

And the condition xp + yq =0.

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must be equal in length.

So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.

But maybe using vectors: the vectors AB and AD must have the same magnitude.

Vector AB is (p - x, q - y).

Vector AD is (-p - x, -q - y).

Wait, no, because point D is (-p, -q). So, vector AD is (-p - x, -q - y).

Wait, or is it? Wait, point A is (x, y) and point D is (-p, -q). So, vector AD is (-p - x, -q - y).

Similarly, vector AB is (p - x, q - y).

Since it's a rhombus, |AB| = |AD|.

So, sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2] = sqrt[(-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2]

Square both sides:

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-p -x)^2 + (-q - y)^2

Expand both sides:

Left side: (p² - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²)

Right side: (p² + 2px + x²) + (q² + 2qy + y²)

Set them equal:

p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y² = p² + 2px + x² + q² + 2qy + y²

Subtract p², x², q², y² from both sides:

-2px - 2qy = 2px + 2qy

Bring all terms to left:

-2px -2qy -2px -2qy = 0

Which is:

-4px -4qy =0

Divide both sides by -4:

px + qy =0.

Wait, but we already have xp + yq =0 from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, this condition is the same as the perpendicular diagonals condition.

So, that doesn't give us any new information. Hmm.

So, now, perhaps another condition from the rhombus. Since all sides are equal, perhaps the vectors AB and AD must satisfy |AB|² = |AD|², but that led to the same condition as the diagonals. So, maybe we need to use another property.

Wait, maybe in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy certain length relations. In a rhombus, the area is (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, all sides are equal, so if s is the length of a side, then d1² + d2² = 4s².

But let's see. Let me compute the lengths of diagonals AC and BD.

Diagonal AC has length sqrt[( -2x)^2 + (-2y)^2] = sqrt(4x² +4y²) = 2*sqrt(x² + y²).

Similarly, diagonal BD has length 2*sqrt(p² + q²).

So, length of AC is 2*sqrt(x² + y²), length of BD is 2*sqrt(p² + q²).

In a rhombus, the area is (AC * BD)/2 = (2*sqrt(x² + y²) * 2*sqrt(p² + q²))/2 = 2*sqrt(x² + y²)*sqrt(p² + q²).

But also, the area of a rhombus can be computed as s² * sin(theta), where theta is one of the internal angles. But maybe that's not helpful here.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and satisfy the relation:

(AC/2)² + (BD/2)² = s²

Where s is the length of a side.

Because each side can be considered as the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs (AC/2) and (BD/2).

So, s² = (AC/2)^2 + (BD/2)^2.

So,

s² = (sqrt(x² + y²))² + (sqrt(p² + q²))²

s² = x² + y² + p² + q².

But since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so s² is the same for all sides.

Alternatively, since we know that the sides AB, BC, etc., are equal, maybe we can express s² in terms of AB.

Compute |AB|²: (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2.

Which is (p^2 - 2px + x^2) + (q^2 - 2qy + y^2) = p² + x² + q² + y² - 2(px + qy).

But from the condition, px + qy =0, so this simplifies to p² + x² + q² + y².

So, |AB|² = x² + y² + p² + q².

Which is the same as s² as before.

So, s² = x² + y² + p² + q².

But we also have the hyperbola equations:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 =1 => 12x² -5y²= 120.  (Multiplying both sides by 120)

Similarly, for point B: p²/20 - q²/24 =1 => 12p² -5q²= 120.

So, we have:

12x² -5y² = 120  ...(1)

12p² -5q² =120    ...(2)

And we have:

xp + yq =0        ...(3)

We need to find BD², which is [2*sqrt(p² + q²)]² =4(p² + q²).

So, BD²=4(p² + q²).

We need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

So, we need to find the supremum (least upper bound) of BD², but make sure it's the greatest number less than BD² for all possible rhombi.

Wait, but perhaps BD² can be made arbitrarily large, but given the constraints, maybe not. Hmm, perhaps BD² is bounded above, so the supremum is a finite number.

Wait, so perhaps we can express BD² in terms of other variables and find its maximum possible value.

Given that, let's consider BD² =4(p² + q²).

From equation (2): 12p² -5q²=120.

We can express q² in terms of p²: 5q²=12p² -120 => q²=(12p² -120)/5.

So, BD²=4(p² + (12p² -120)/5 )

Simplify:

=4[ (5p² +12p² -120)/5 ]

=4[ (17p² -120)/5 ]

= (68p² - 480)/5

So, BD²= (68p² -480)/5.

But we also have the condition from equation (3): xp + yq=0.

From equation (1): 12x² -5y²= 120.

Let me solve for y²: y²=(12x² -120)/5.

Similarly, from equation (2): q²=(12p² -120)/5.

So, y²=(12x² -120)/5, q²=(12p² -120)/5.

So, equation (3): xp + yq=0.

But y and q are variables, so I need to express this condition in terms of x and p or something else.

Wait, perhaps express y as a function of x, and q as a function of p, then substitute into equation (3).

Wait, but equation (3) is xp + yq=0.

But y and q can be positive or negative, but squared terms are positive. So, maybe express y in terms of x, and q in terms of p, and then plug into (3).

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe use substitution with the hyperbola parametrization.

Wait, hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. Let me recall. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b²=1, parametrization is x = a cosh θ, y = b sinh θ.

Similarly, for the other branch, x= -a cosh θ, y= ±b sinh θ.

But since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps points A and C are on one branch, and B and D on the other? Wait, but in our case, points A and C are (x,y) and (-x,-y), so they're on the same branch if x is positive. Similarly, B and D are on the same branch if p is positive.

Wait, but hyperbola has two branches. So, in this problem, are the points A, B, C, D on the same branch or different branches?

Wait, the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24=1, which is a hyperbola opening to the left and right. So, points on the right branch have x positive, left branch x negative.

But since A is (x, y), C is (-x, -y). So, if A is on the right branch, C is on the left, and same with B and D. So, points A and C are on opposite branches, as are B and D.

So, in this case, points A and C are on opposite branches, so are B and D. So, perhaps A and B are on different branches.

Wait, but in a rhombus, all four points should be arranged such that the sides are equal and the diagonals intersect at the origin.

Wait, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B as points on the hyperbola, then express the conditions.

Alternatively, let me think of hyperbola parametrization.

Let me parametrize point A as (x, y) = (sqrt(20) secθ, sqrt(24) tanθ)

Similarly, point B can be parametrized as (sqrt(20) secφ, sqrt(24) tanφ)

But since points A and C are (-x, -y), and points B and D are (-p, -q), the parametrization should reflect that.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, maybe express points A and B in terms of parameters t and s, but perhaps that's getting too abstract.

Wait, perhaps I can express y in terms of x from equation (1) and q in terms of p from equation (2), then plug into equation (3).

So, from equation (1): y² = (12x² -120)/5

From equation (2): q² = (12p² -120)/5

So, y = ±sqrt( (12x² -120)/5 )

q = ±sqrt( (12p² -120)/5 )

But equation (3): xp + yq =0.

Assuming that y and q have the same sign? Or opposite signs?

Wait, let me see. Suppose point A is (x, y) and point B is (p, q). Since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.

But perhaps the signs of y and q depend on the positions of the points.

Alternatively, to avoid confusion, maybe express y and q as variables, but with the condition that xp + yq=0.

So, equation (3): xp + yq =0.

So, we can write y = - (xp)/q.

But then, from equation (1): 12x² -5y²=120.

Substitute y:

12x² -5*(x²p²/q²) = 120.

Similarly, equation (2): 12p² -5q²=120.

Let me denote equation (2) as:

12p² -5q²=120.

Let me solve for q²:

q²=(12p² -120)/5.

So, q²= (12(p² -10))/5.

So, q= sqrt(12(p² -10)/5), but we'll keep it as q² for substitution.

So, from equation (1), substituting y:

12x² -5*(x²p²/q²)=120.

So, let's plug in q² from equation (2):

q²=(12p² -120)/5.

So,

12x² -5*(x²p²)/[(12p² -120)/5] =120.

Simplify denominator:

=12x² -5*(5x²p²)/(12p² -120) =120.

Simplify:

=12x² - (25x²p²)/(12p² -120) =120.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe factor out 12 from the denominator:

12p² -120=12(p² -10).

So, 25x²p²/(12(p² -10)).

So, equation becomes:

12x² - (25x²p²)/(12(p² -10)) =120.

Let me write it as:

12x² - [25x²p²/(12(p² -10))] =120.

Multiply both sides by 12(p² -10) to eliminate the denominator:

12x² *12(p² -10) -25x²p² =120 *12(p² -10).

Compute term by term:

First term: 144x²(p² -10)

Second term: -25x²p²

Third term: 1440(p² -10)

So, equation:

144x²(p² -10) -25x²p² =1440(p² -10)

Factor x² from the left side:

x²[144(p² -10) -25p²] =1440(p² -10)

Simplify inside the brackets:

144p² -1440 -25p² = (144p² -25p²) -1440 =119p² -1440.

So, equation becomes:

x²(119p² -1440) =1440(p² -10)

Thus,

x²= [1440(p² -10)]/[119p² -1440]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator: 1440(p² -10)=1440p² -14400.

Denominator:119p² -1440.

So,

x²= (1440p² -14400)/(119p² -1440)

We can factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1440p² -14400=1440(p² -10)

Denominator:119p² -1440=119p² -1440.

So,

x²= [1440(p² -10)]/[119p² -1440]

Now, let me write this as:

x²= [1440(p² -10)]/[119p² -1440] = [1440(p² -10)]/[119p² -1440]

I can factor numerator and denominator:

Wait, perhaps factor 1440 and 119p².

Wait, 1440=144*10, 119 is a prime? Hmm, 119=17*7, yes.

Not sure if that helps. Let me consider p² as a variable, say let u=p².

So, x²= [1440(u -10)]/[119u -1440]

We also have from equation (1): 12x² -5y²=120.

But we already used that to get x² in terms of u.

Wait, but perhaps from equation (1), since x² is expressed in terms of u, we can write y² in terms of u.

From equation (1):

y²=(12x² -120)/5.

So, substitute x²:

y²=(12*(1440(u -10)/(119u -1440)) -120)/5.

Let me compute this:

First, compute 12*(1440(u -10))/(119u -1440):

= (17280(u -10))/(119u -1440)

Then subtract 120:

= [17280(u -10) - 120*(119u -1440)] / (119u -1440)

Compute numerator:

17280(u -10) -120*(119u -1440)

=17280u -172800 -14280u +172800

Simplify:

(17280u -14280u) + (-172800 +172800)

=3000u +0

So, numerator is 3000u.

Thus, y²= [3000u/(119u -1440)] /5 = (3000u)/(5*(119u -1440))=600u/(119u -1440)

So, y²=600u/(119u -1440)

Similarly, from equation (3): xp + yq=0.

But we have x in terms of u and p as well, but perhaps we can find another relation.

Wait, from equation (3): xp + yq=0.

We have x² and y² in terms of u=p². Let me express x and y in terms of u.

Wait, x²=1440(u -10)/(119u -1440). So, x= sqrt(1440(u -10)/(119u -1440)).

Similarly, y²=600u/(119u -1440). So, y= sqrt(600u/(119u -1440)).

But equation (3) is xp + yq=0.

So, x*p + y*q =0.

But we also have point B: (p, q). From equation (2): 12p² -5q²=120.

So, q²=(12p² -120)/5= (12u -120)/5.

So, q= sqrt( (12u -120)/5 ).

So, q= sqrt(12(u -10)/5 ).

So, equation (3): x*p + y*q=0.

Expressed as:

sqrt(1440(u -10)/(119u -1440)) * p + sqrt(600u/(119u -1440)) * sqrt(12(u -10)/5 )=0

Hmm, this looks messy, but perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but we need to be careful with signs.

But before that, let's note that since A and B are on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation, so u must be greater than or equal to 10, because from equation (2):12p² -5q²=120, and since q² must be positive, 12p² must be greater than 120, so p²>10.

Similarly, from equation (1):x²=1440(u -10)/(119u -1440).

The denominator 119u -1440 must have the same sign as the numerator 1440(u -10).

So, 1440(u -10) and (119u -1440) have the same sign.

Let me analyze the signs.

Case 1: Both numerator and denominator positive.

So, 1440(u -10) >0 => u>10.

119u -1440>0 => u>1440/119≈12.1.

So, u>12.1.

Case 2: Both numerator and denominator negative.

1440(u -10)<0 => u<10.

119u -1440 <0 => u<1440/119≈12.1.

But u=p²>10 (from equation (2)), so u cannot be less than 10, because from equation (2), p² must be greater than 10.

Therefore, u>12.1 is the only possible case.

So, u>12.1.

So, we can proceed under the assumption that u>12.1.

So, back to equation (3):

sqrt(1440(u -10)/(119u -1440)) * p + sqrt(600u/(119u -1440)) * sqrt(12(u -10)/5 )=0

Let me factor out sqrt(1/(119u -1440)) from both terms.

First term: sqrt(1440(u -10)/(119u -1440)) = sqrt(1440(u -10)) / sqrt(119u -1440)

Similarly, second term:

sqrt(600u/(119u -1440)) * sqrt(12(u -10)/5 ) = sqrt(600u *12(u -10)/(5*(119u -1440)))

Simplify inside the sqrt:

600u*12(u -10)/(5*(119u -1440)) = (7200u(u -10))/(5*(119u -1440))= 1440u(u -10)/(119u -1440)

So, second term becomes sqrt(1440u(u -10)/(119u -1440)).

So, equation (3):

[ sqrt(1440(u -10)) / sqrt(119u -1440) ] * p + sqrt(1440u(u -10)/(119u -1440)) =0

Let me factor out sqrt(1440(u -10)/ (119u -1440)):

sqrt(1440(u -10)/(119u -1440)) [ p + sqrt(u) ] =0

Wait, let's see:

First term: sqrt(1440(u-10)) * p / sqrt(119u -1440) = sqrt(1440(u-10)/(119u -1440)) * p

Second term: sqrt(1440u(u -10)/(119u -1440)) = sqrt(1440(u -10)/(119u -1440)) * sqrt(u)

So, equation becomes:

sqrt(1440(u -10)/(119u -1440)) [ p + sqrt(u) ] =0

Since sqrt(1440(u -10)/(119u -1440)) is positive (because u>12.1, as established), the only way this product is zero is if [ p + sqrt(u) ]=0.

So,

p + sqrt(u) =0.

But u=p², so sqrt(u)=|p|.

Since u=p², sqrt(u)=|p|. So, if p is positive, sqrt(u)=p; if p is negative, sqrt(u)=-p.

So, equation p + sqrt(u)=0.

Case 1: p positive.

Then sqrt(u)=p.

So, equation becomes p + p=0 => 2p=0 => p=0, which contradicts u=p²>12.1.

Case 2: p negative.

sqrt(u)=|p|=-p.

So, equation becomes p + (-p)=0 =>0=0.

So, that holds for any p negative.

So, p must be negative.

So, p is negative, and sqrt(u)=|p|=-p.

Thus, p is negative, and u=p².

So, now, we can express equation (3) only requires that p is negative.

So, we have p is negative, and u=p²>12.1.

Now, let's proceed.

So, from equation (3), we have that p is negative.

So, now, we can express BD²=4(p² + q²)=4(u + q²).

From equation (2): q²=(12u -120)/5.

So, BD²=4(u + (12u -120)/5 )

Simplify:

=4*( (5u +12u -120)/5 )

=4*(17u -120)/5

= (68u -480)/5.

So, BD²=(68u -480)/5.

We need to find the supremum of BD², so we need to find the maximum value of BD² in terms of u.

But u=p² can be any real number greater than 12.1, as established earlier.

But wait, is there an upper limit on u?

Wait, perhaps not, but let's check.

Wait, let's see. From the parametrization, u can be as large as possible, but perhaps there is a constraint from the hyperbola.

Wait, the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24=1. So, x can be any real number except between -sqrt(20) and sqrt(20). So, as u increases, p² increases, so p becomes more negative, but I don't think there's an upper limit on u.

So, as u approaches infinity, BD²=(68u -480)/5 approaches infinity. So, BD² can be made as large as desired. But that can't be, because the hyperbola is unbounded, but the rhombus must be such that all four points lie on the hyperbola. Hmm, but perhaps there's a constraint that comes from the sides needing to be equal.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, we found that BD² can be made arbitrarily large as u increases. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all possible rhombi. But if BD² can be made as large as desired, then the supremum is infinity, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum is infinity, but the question is asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, which would be the infimum of BD²? Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, wait. Let me read the problem again.

"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi."

So, the number should be less than BD² for every possible rhombus. So, the maximum such number is the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi. Because if BD² can be made arbitrarily small, then the infimum would be the greatest lower bound, but if BD² is bounded below, then that would be the answer. But if BD² can be made as small as possible, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be minus infinity, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, but in our case, BD² is (68u -480)/5. u>12.1.

So, when u approaches 12.1 from above, BD² approaches (68*12.1 -480)/5.

Let me compute that.

68*12.1=68*12 +68*0.1=816 +6.8=822.8.

822.8 -480=342.8.

342.8 /5=68.56.

So, as u approaches 12.1, BD² approaches 68.56.

As u increases beyond 12.1, BD² increases beyond 68.56.

So, the minimal value of BD² is approximately 68.56, which is 17*4=68.56. Wait, 68.56 is 6856/100=1714/25=68.56.

Wait, 1714 divided by 25 is 68.56.

Wait, 25*68=1700, 25*0.56=14, so 1700+14=1714.

So, 1714/25=68.56.

So, as u approaches 12.1, BD² approaches 1714/25.

Which is 68.56.

So, BD² can be as small as just above 68.56, and can be made arbitrarily large.

So, the minimal value of BD² is 1714/25, approximately 68.56.

But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD² is 1714/25, which is the minimal value. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is the infimum, which is 1714/25.

But wait, is 1714/25 the minimal BD²? Let me confirm.

From BD²=(68u -480)/5.

As u approaches 12.1, BD² approaches (68*12.1 -480)/5.

Compute 68*12.1:

68*12=816, 68*0.1=6.8, so 816+6.8=822.8.

822.8-480=342.8.

342.8 /5=68.56.

So, 68.56=6856/100=1714/25.

So, BD² approaches 1714/25 as u approaches 12.1 from above.

Thus, the minimal value of BD² is 1714/25, and BD² can be larger than that.

So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is the infimum, which is 1714/25.

But 1714/25 can be reduced?

Wait, 1714 divided by 2 is 857, 25 is 5², so no common factors. So, 1714/25 is the reduced fraction.

But let me check 1714 and 25: 25=5², 1714 divided by 2 is 857, which is a prime number? Let me check.

857: It's not even, 8+5+7=20, not divisible by 3. 5: doesn't end with 0 or5. 7: 7*122=854, 857-854=3, not divisible by 7. 11: 11*77=847, 857-847=10, not divisible by 11. 13: 13*65=845, 857-845=12, not divisible by 13. 17: 17*50=850, 857-850=7, not divisible by 17. 19: 19*45=855, 857-855=2, not divisible by 19. 23: 23*37=851, 857-851=6, not divisible by 23. 29: 29*29=841, 857-841=16, not divisible by 29. 31: 31*27=837, 857-837=20, not divisible by 31. 37: 37*23=851, 857-851=6, not divisible. So, 857 is a prime. So, 1714/25 is the simplest form.

But let me compute 1714 ÷25:

25*68=1700, 1714-1700=14, so 68 and 14/25, which is 68.56.

So, 68.56 is the minimal BD².

But the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the minimal BD² is 1714/25, so any number less than that would not be a lower bound for all BD². But the question is the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, perhaps the question is to find the supremum of BD², but that's infinity. Or perhaps the infimum.

Wait, but the wording is: "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi."

Which would be the infimum of BD², because for all rhombi, BD² is greater than or equal to the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum.

But in our case, the infimum is 1714/25, which is the minimal BD².

So, the answer is 1714/25.

But 1714/25 can be simplified as a mixed number: 68 14/25, but as a fraction, it's 1714/25.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again.

From BD²=(68u -480)/5.

At minimal u, which is just above 12.1, BD² approaches (68*12.1 -480)/5.

Compute 68*12.1:

68 *12=816, 68*0.1=6.8, so 816+6.8=822.8.

822.8-480=342.8.

342.8 divided by5 is 68.56.

Which is 6856/100=1714/25.

Yes, correct.

So, the minimal BD² is 1714/25.

Thus, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 1714/25.

But wait, in the problem statement, they might expect an integer answer, but 1714/25 is 68.56, which isn't integer. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's re-express BD².

From BD²=4(p² + q²)=4(u + q²).

From equation (2): q²=(12u -120)/5.

So, BD²=4(u + (12u -120)/5 )=4*( (5u +12u -120)/5 )=4*(17u -120)/5.

Which is (68u -480)/5.

So, BD²=(68u -480)/5.

As u approaches 12.1, BD² approaches (68*12.1 -480)/5.

Compute 68*12.1:

68*12=816, 68*0.1=6.8, so 816+6.8=822.8.

822.8 -480=342.8.

342.8 /5=68.56.

So, 68.56=6856/100=1714/25.

But 1714/25 is not an integer, but the question says "put your final answer within \boxed{}." So, maybe it's 68.56, but I should check if 1714/25 can be simplified or expressed differently.

Wait, 1714 divided by 2 is 857, which is a prime. So, 1714/25 can't be simplified further.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the minimal BD² is when the rhombus is a square.

Wait, but can a rhombus on this hyperbola be a square?

In a square, all sides are equal, and diagonals are equal and perpendicular. But in our hyperbola, the diagonals can't be equal because the hyperbola is symmetric but not a circle.

Wait, in a square, both diagonals would have to be of equal length, but on a hyperbola, points are arranged such that it's not possible for both diagonals to be equal.

Alternatively, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the minimal BD² occurs when points A and B are such that BD is minimal.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, as u approaches 12.1, BD² approaches 1714/25≈68.56.

But let me think differently. Maybe there's a constraint I missed.

Wait, when u approaches 12.1, which is 1440/119≈12.1, then the denominator 119u -1440 approaches zero.

So, as u approaches 12.1 from above, x²=1440(u -10)/(119u -1440) approaches infinity.

Wait, that can't be. Because if x² approaches infinity, then y²= (12x² -120)/5 also approaches infinity.

But that may cause the points A and B to be at infinity. But in reality, for a rhombus, all four points must lie on the hyperbola, but if points A and B go to infinity, then the rhombus becomes larger.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, as u approaches 12.1, BD² approaches 68.56, but x² approaches infinity. So, perhaps the minimal BD² occurs when u approaches 12.1, but the rhombus can't actually achieve that because points go to infinity.

Wait, but the problem says "for all such rhombi," so we're looking for a lower bound, but the rhombi can be made such that BD² approaches 68.56 from above, but never actually reach it.

So, the infimum is 68.56, but it's not attained. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 68.56, but since BD² can get arbitrarily close to it from above, the number must be 68.56.

But the question wants an integer less than BD² for all rhombi. Wait, no, it says "greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi."

But 68.56 is the infimum, so any number less than that would not be a lower bound for all rhombi. Wait, no, the question is looking for a number that is less than BD² for all rhombi, and the greatest such number. So, if BD² can get as close as desired to 68.56, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 68.56, because BD² is always greater than 68.56.

Wait, but 68.56 is not an integer. Wait, the problem statement says "put your final answer within \boxed{}." So, perhaps I need to write it as a fraction.

Wait, 1714/25 is 68.56, but 1714 divided by 25 is 68.56. So, as a fraction, it's 1714/25.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-express BD².

From BD²=(68u -480)/5.

So, when u=12.1=121/10, BD²=(68*(121/10) -480)/5.

Compute 68*(121/10)= (68*121)/10= 8228/10=822.8.

822.8 -480=342.8.

342.8/5=68.56.

Yes, correct.

So, 68.56 is 1714/25.

So, the answer is 1714/25, which is 68.56.

But the problem says "greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi," which is the infimum, which is 1714/25.

So, the answer is 1714/25.

But 1714 and 25: 1714 ÷2=857, which is a prime, so the fraction cannot be reduced further.

So, the answer is 1714/25.

But the problem statement says "put your final answer within \boxed{}." So, I think the answer is 1714/25, which is 68.56.

Wait, but 1714 divided by 25 is 68.56, which is correct.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1714}{25}}


Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) forming a rhombus \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin, we need to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi.

1. **Hyperbola Equations**:
   - Points \(A(x, y)\) and \(B(p, q)\) lie on the hyperbola, giving us:
     \[
     \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1
     \]
   - These can be rewritten as:
     \[
     12x^2 - 5y^2 = 120 \quad \text{and} \quad 12p^2 - 5q^2 = 120
     \]

2. **Condition for Perpendicular Diagonals**:
   - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition:
     \[
     xp + yq = 0
     \]

3. **Expression for \(BD^2\)**:
   - Using the hyperbola equations, we express \(y^2\) and \(q^2\) in terms of \(x\) and \(p\):
     \[
     y^2 = \frac{12x^2 - 120}{5} \quad \text{and} \quad q^2 = \frac{12p^2 - 120}{5}
     \]
   - Substituting these into the condition \(xp + yq = 0\), we find that \(p\) must be negative and express \(BD^2\) as:
     \[
     BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)
     \]
   - Substituting \(q^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\):
     \[
     BD^2 = 4\left(p^2 + \frac{12p^2 - 120}{5}\right) = \frac{68p^2 - 480}{5}
     \]

4. **Finding the Infimum**:
   - As \(p^2\) approaches its minimum value (just above 12.1), we find the minimum value of \(BD^2\):
     \[
     BD^2 \approx \frac{68 \times 12.1 - 480}{5} = \frac{1714}{25}
     \]

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1714}{25}}
\]
