Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop stops. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, let's read the problem again carefully to make sure I understand all the details. Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they're asking what the time would be if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, again including the t minutes.

Hmm. So, I need to find the total time when she walks at s + 0.5 km/h. But to do that, I think I first need to find the values of s and t. Because right now, the problem gives me two different scenarios with different speeds and different total times. 

So, let's break it down. 

When she walks at speed s km/h, the time taken is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, but 4 hours is 240 minutes. So, the actual walking time would be 240 minus t minutes. Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes. So, the walking time is 144 - t minutes.

But wait, hold on. The time taken for the walk is the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop. So, the 4 hours is the total time, which includes both walking and the coffee break. So, the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly, the walking time at the higher speed is 2 hours 24 minutes minus t minutes.

But I think it's easier to convert everything into hours because the speed is in km/h. So, let me convert t from minutes to hours. Let's say t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:
- Distance = 9 km
- Speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours = walking time + coffee time
So, walking time = 4 - (t/60) hours.

But the walking time can
