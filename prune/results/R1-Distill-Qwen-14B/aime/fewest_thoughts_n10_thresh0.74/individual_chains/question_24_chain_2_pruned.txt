Okay, I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and understand what it's asking.

So, there's a list of positive integers with a few properties:
1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more times than any other number, and no other number has the same count.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. Unique mode means there's only one mode, and it's 9. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.
- **Median**: The middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of items, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list if the count is odd, or if it's the average of two numbers, which might not be an integer.

Wait, the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, first, the list must have an even number of elements because if it were odd, the median would be the middle element, which is in the list. But here, the median is an integer not in the list. Therefore, the number of elements in the list must be even.

Let me denote the number of elements as n, where n is even.

So, n is an even number.

Next, since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears k times. Then any other number can appear at most k-1 times.

Now, the sum of all elements is 30. So, the sum of all the numbers is 30.

The median is an integer not in the list. So, for an even number of elements, the median is the average of the n/2-th and (n/2 + 1)-th elements.

Let me think about possible n values. The sum is 30, and all elements are positive integers. So, the number of elements can't be more than 30 (if all are 1). But practically, n isn't going to be too large because 9 is the mode, so it's better to have several 9s.

Wait, let's think about possible n. Let's consider n as small as possible but even.

Let me try to build the list step by step.

First, since the median is not in the list, which is an integer. Let's denote the median as m. So, m is an integer not present in the list, and it's the average of the two middle numbers.

Since the list is in order, the two middle numbers (let's say a and b) must satisfy (a + b)/2 = m, so a + b = 2m.

But since m is an integer not in the list, a and b must be either both less than or greater than m, but wait no, because m is the average. So, for example, if a < m < b, then m is between a and b. But since m is not in the list, the two middle numbers can't be m, but they can be numbers on either side.

Wait, but if a and b are such that their average is m, but neither a nor b is equal to m, then either a < m < b or b < m < a. But since the list is in order, a <= b, so a <= m <= b. But m is not in the list, so a < m < b.

So, a and b are two numbers surrounding m, and m is not in the list.

So, for example, if a = m - 1
