Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, so first, I should recall some properties of roots of unity.

I know that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for k from 1 to 12. That means ω has order 13, right?

The product we're given is the product over k=0 to 12 of the terms (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can rewrite the term in the product in a different way.

Let me look at 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe factor it or see if it relates to some known polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a quadratic in ω^k or something else.

Wait, let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, maybe factor it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. That looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of ω^k.

So, if I treat ω^k as a variable, say x, then the term becomes x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, that quadratic might factor or have roots that I can find.

Let me find the roots of x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0. The discriminant is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, that means x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, in terms of ω^k, that would be (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the term 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Which is equal to the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, that means our original product is equal to [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over all ω^k - a, where a is some complex number, can be related to cyclotomic polynomials or something like that.

Wait, let me recall that the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Because Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) for k from 1 to 12, since ω^0 = 1 is not a root of Φ_13(x).

Wait, but in our case, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes ω^0 = 1. So, the product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) is equal to x^13 - 1, because the 13th roots of unity are exactly the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0.

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. Therefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = (x - 1)(x - ω)(x - ω^2)...(x - ω^12) = x^13 - 1.

So, that suggests that product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1.

So, for our case, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1. Wait, because substituting x = a into this product gives a^13 - 1.

Wait, let me check that. If I have product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if I replace x with a, then product (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1.

But in our problem, the terms are (ω^k - a) = -(a - ω^k). So, if I have product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} ( - (a - ω^k) ) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k ) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = - (a^13 - 1).

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1).

So, going back to our problem, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ].

Similarly, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].

So, the original product P is equal to [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

Multiplying the two negatives together gives (-1)*(-1) = 1, so P = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

So, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, then multiply them together.

First, let me compute (1 + i)^13.

I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Since 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle π/4 radians (45 degrees).

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Let me compute [sqrt(2)]^13 first.

sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13π/4}, and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Now, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13π/4} and e^{-i * 13π/4}.

But 13π/4 is more than 2π. Let me subtract multiples of 2π to get the angle within [0, 2π).

13π/4 divided by 2π is (13/4)/(2) = 13/8 = 1.625. So, subtract 2π once: 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, -13π/4: adding 4π to get it positive: -13π/4 + 4π = -13π/4 + 16π/4 =
