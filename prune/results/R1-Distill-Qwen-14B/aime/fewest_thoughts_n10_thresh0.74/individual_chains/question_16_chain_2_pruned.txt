Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p². The answer should be the integer m inside a box.

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared for some n. Once I find that p, then I have to find the smallest m where m^4 + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by understanding the first part: finding the smallest prime p such that p² divides n^4 + 1 for some n.

I remember that for primes, we can use Fermat's little theorem, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here. Maybe I should look at some small primes and see if n^4 ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution.

Wait, n^4 ≡ -1 mod p². So, n^8 ≡ 1 mod p². That suggests that the order of n modulo p² is 8. But wait, is that right? Because if n^4 ≡ -1 mod p², then n^8 ≡ 1. So the order would be 8.

But for the multiplicative group modulo p², which is cyclic only when p is an odd prime. Wait, when p is 2, the multiplicative group mod 2² is not cyclic, it's isomorphic to the Klein four-group, right? So maybe 2 is a candidate as well.

But let's check for small primes first.

Let me start with p=2. Let's see if there exists an n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by 4.

Compute n^4 mod 4. Let's see:

n=1: 1^4=1 → 1+1=2, which is not divisible by 4.

n=2: 2^4=16 → 16+1=17, which is 1 mod 4, not divisible by 4.

Wait, 17 mod 4 is 1, so 17 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, 16 is 0 mod 4, so 16 +1=17 is 1 mod 4. So n=2: 17, n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. Hmm, not 0 mod 4.

Wait, n=0: 0^4 +1=1, which is 1 mod 4. So, seems like for p=2, no n satisfies n^4 +1 ≡ 0 mod 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3.

Check if n^4 ≡ -1 mod 9.

First, compute n^4 mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since modulo 9, and 9 is small).

n=1: 1^4=1 → 1+1=2 mod9≠0

n=2: 16 mod9=7 → 7+1=8 mod9≠0

n=3: 81 mod9=0 → 0+1=1≠0

n=4: 4^4=256 mod9. Let's compute 256/9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 +1=5≠0

n=5: 5^4=625. 625/9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 4+1=5≠0

n=6: 6^4=1296 mod9=0 → 0+1=1≠0

n=7: 7^4=... 7^2=49 mod9=4, so 4^2=16 mod9=7. So 7 +1=8≠0

n=8: 8^4= (8^2)^2=64^2=4096. 4096 mod9: 9*455=4095, so 4096 ≡1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0.

So for p=3, no n satisfies n^4 +1≡0 mod9. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5.

Check n^4 ≡-1 mod25.

So n^4 ≡24 mod25.

Let me compute n^4 mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

But that's a lot. Maybe I can find a smarter way.

First, note that modulo 5, n^4 must be ≡-1 mod5. Because if n^4≡-1 mod25, then n^4≡-1 mod5.

So let's see if n^4 ≡-1 mod5 has a solution.

Compute n^4 mod5. Since 5 is small, the possible residues are 0,1,2,3,4.

n: 1, 2, 3,4,5.

n=1: 1 mod5=1

n=2: 16 mod5=1

n=3: 81 mod5=1

n=4: 256 mod5=1

n=5: 0.

So n^4 mod5 is either 0 or 1. So n^4 ≡-1 mod5 would mean 1 ≡4 mod5, which is not true. So no solution for n^4 ≡-1 mod5, so p=5 is out.

Wait, so p=5 is out because even mod5, n^4 can't be -1.

Next, p=7.

Check if n^4 ≡-1 mod49.

Again, first check mod7.

n^4 ≡-1 mod7?

Compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to6.

n=1:
