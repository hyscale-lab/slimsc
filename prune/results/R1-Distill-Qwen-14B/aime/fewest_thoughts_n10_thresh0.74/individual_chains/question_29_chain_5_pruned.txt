Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let's try to visualize and understand the problem first.

There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, all four points lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting because if four points lie on a circle, they are concyclic or lie on a circumcircle, which might mean that certain cyclic quadrilateral properties apply.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find CE.

Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so FG = EH = 17, EF = GH = 184.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, imagine rectangle ABCD with side BC =16 and AB=107, and rectangle EFGH, which is probably placed such that side EF is along the same line as DC. Wait, but D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E is somewhere along DC, but not sure exactly where. Similarly, F is another point along that line.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Hmm, cyclic quadrilaterals have properties like the sum of opposite angles equals 180 degrees, and the power of a point. Maybe we can use some of those properties.

Let me label the coordinates of the points to make this easier. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0) because DC is 107. Point B would be at (0,16), and A at (0,16)? Wait, no, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB is 107, BC is 16. Wait, so AB is the vertical side? Wait, no, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are the length and width. Let me clarify.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, BC is the adjacent side. So, AB=107, BC=16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (107,0), B is at (0,16), and A is at (0,16). Wait, no, that can't be because that would make AB a vertical line from (0,16) to (0,0), which is length 16, but AB is given as 107. Hmm, maybe I messed up the labeling.

Wait, perhaps ABCD is labeled such that AB is the base. Let me think again. Let's define the rectangle ABCD with points in order: A, B, C, D. So, AB is the base, BC is the right side, CD is the top, and DA is the left side.

Therefore, if AB is 107, BC is 16, then AB is horizontal, BC is vertical. So, if I place point A at (0,0), then B is at (107,0), C is at (107,16), and D is at (0,16).

Wait, but then E, F, G, H are points of the other rectangle. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's figure out where E and F are.

Points D is at (0,16), and C is at (107,16). So, the line DC is a horizontal line from (0,16) to (107,16). So, points E and F must lie on this line.

But since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is one of its sides. Given that EF = 184, and FG =17. So, in rectangle EFGH, EF is a side, say the base, with length 184, and FG is the vertical side with length 17.

Since E and F are on DC, which is the line y=16, from (0,16) to (107,16). Hmm, but EF is 184, which is longer than DC's length of 107. That's confusing because if E and F are on DC, the maximum distance between them is 107, but EF is 184. That can't be. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I placed the points incorrectly. Let me try again.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangles are arranged such that D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning that line DC is extended beyond C and D to include E and F. So, E and F might be on the line DC but beyond points D and C.

Wait, that could make sense. So, line DC is from D to C, but if E and F are on that line, they could be on either side of DC.

So, for example, E could be to the left
