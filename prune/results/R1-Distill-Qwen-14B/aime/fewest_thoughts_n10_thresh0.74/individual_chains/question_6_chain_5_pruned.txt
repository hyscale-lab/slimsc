Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are a bit complicated, though. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the functions are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, the equations given are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many times these two graphs intersect.

Hmm, okay. So intersections between y and x would mean that at some point (a, b), both equations are satisfied. That is, b = 4g(f(sin(2πa))) and a = 4g(f(cos(3πb))). So essentially, I'm looking for pairs (a, b) where both these equations hold.

But since the equations involve trigonometric functions with different arguments and the functions f and g involve absolute values, this might get a bit tricky. Let me try to understand f(x) and g(x) first.

So f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let me think about what this looks like. The innermost part is |x|, which is a V-shape graph with its vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so the vertex would be at (0, -1/2). But then taking the absolute value of that would reflect any negative parts above the x-axis. So the graph of f(x) would be a V-shape that touches the x-axis at x=1/2 and x=-1/2, and has its vertex at (0, 1/2). Wait, no, wait. Let me actually plot some points.

Let me consider f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. For x >=0, |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So that's a V-shape with vertex at x=1/2, y=0. Similarly for x < 0, since |x| is still positive, f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |, so same as the right side. So overall, f(x) is a V-shaped graph that has its vertex at x=0, y=1/2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when x=0, |x|=0, so f(0)=| -1/2 | = 1/2. When x=1/2, |1/2|=1/2, so f(1/2)=|1/2 -1/2|=0. Similarly at x=-1/2, it's 0. So the graph of f(x) is a "W" shape? Wait, no, because it's symmetric on both sides. So actually, it's a V-shape on the right and left, but combined, it's two Vs?

Wait, maybe it's easier to graph f(x). Let me take a few x values:

x=0: f(0)=|0 -1/2|=1/2.

x=1/2: f(1/2)=|1/2 -1/2|=0.

x=1: f(1)=|1 -1/2|=1/2.

x=-1/2: same as 1/2, f(-1/2)=0.

x=-1: same as x=1, f(-1)=1/2.

So the graph of f(x) is a V-shape on each side, but since it's symmetric, I think it's a V centered at x=0, but with the vertex at (0,1/2), and it touches the x-axis at x=1/2 and x=-1/2. So f(x) is a "V" that peaks at (0,1/2) and has its arms going down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So it's like an upside-down V but centered at 0 with the peak at 1/2.

Similarly, let's consider g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's do the same analysis.

g(0)=|0 -1/4|=1/4.

g(1/4)=|1/4 -1/4|=0.

g(1/2)=|1/2 -1/4|=1/4.

g(-1/4)=0.

g(-1/2)=1/4.

So the graph of g(x) is similar but with a smaller "V". It peaks at (0,1/4) and touches the x-axis at x=1/4 and x=-1/4. So it's a V-shape with vertex at (0,1/4) and arms going down to x=±1/4.

Okay, so now I have f(x) and g(x). Next, the functions inside the equations are 4g(f(...)).

Let me consider the function h(x) = 4g(f(x)). Let's try to figure out what h(x) looks like.

First, f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, which as we saw, goes between 0 and 1/2. So f(x) ∈ [0, 1/2]. Then, g(f(x)) = ||f(x)| - 1/4|. But since f(x) is non-negative, g(f(x)) = |f(x) - 1/4|.

So g(f(x)) is |f(x) - 1/4|. Since f(x) ∈ [0, 1/2], let's see what values this can take.

Case 1: f(x) ≥ 1/4. Then g(f(x)) = f(x) - 1/4.

Case 2: f(x) < 1/4. Then g(f(x)) = 1/4 - f(x).

So now, the maximum value of g(f(x)) occurs when f(x) is 0 or 1/2. Let's see:

At f(x)=0: g(f(x))=1/4.

At f(x)=1/2: g(f(x))= |1/2 -1/4|=1/4.

Wait, that's interesting. So the maximum value of g
