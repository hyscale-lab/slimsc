Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. Then, express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Alright, let's break this down.

First, let me understand the problem. Jen is in a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

So, we need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. That is, P(grand prize | prize). 

I remember that conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). So here, A is the event that she wins the grand prize, and B is the event that she wins a prize. But wait, actually, if she wins the grand prize, that automatically means she also won a prize because winning the grand prize requires all four numbers to match, which is a subset of having at least two match. So, P(A and B) is just P(A), because A is a subset of B.

So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B). So, I need to find P(A) and P(B).

Let me figure out what these probabilities are. The lottery is that 4 numbers are selected from 10, and Jen picks 4 numbers. The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is 210.

First, let's compute P(A), the probability of the grand prize. That's the probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the four chosen. Since there's only one way this can happen (the exact four numbers), P(A) is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, I need P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. So, she can have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers matching. Wait, but she can't have exactly four unless she wins the grand prize, which is already considered in P(A). So, in her prize, she can have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four. So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four matches.

But since we're dealing with conditional probability, I think it's easier to compute the number of favorable outcomes for each case and divide by the total number of possible outcomes.

The total number of ways the lottery can choose four numbers is C(10,4) = 210.

Let me compute the number of favorable cases for B (at least two matches):

Case 1: Exactly two matches.

To compute this, we need to choose 2 numbers that match Jen's, and the remaining 2 numbers are from the other 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). So, the number of ways is C(4,2) * C(6,2). Let's compute that.

C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.

Case 2: Exactly three matches.

Here, Jen has three numbers matching. So, choose 3 from her 4, and the remaining 1 from the other 6. So, C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Case 3: Exactly four matches.

This is the grand prize case, which we already know is 1.

So, the total number of favorable cases for B is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) is 115 / 210.

Similarly, the number of favorable cases for A is 1, so P(A) is 1 / 210.

Therefore, using the formula P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, so that would make m = 1 and n = 115. Are they coprime? 1 and 115 share no common factors besides 1, so yes, they are coprime.

Thus, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

But wait, let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.

Let me recount the number of favorable cases for B.

Exactly two matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90. That seems correct.

Exactly three matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24. That sounds right.

Exactly four matches: C(4,4)=1. So total is 90+24+1=115. Total possible is 210.

So P(B)=115/210=23/42 when simplified.

Wait, 115 divided by 5 is 23, 210 divided by 5 is 42. So yes, 23/42.

P(A)=1/210.

So, P(A|B)= (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23)= (1)/(5*23)=1/115.

So, 1 and 115 are coprime, so m+n=1+115=116.

I think that's correct. So, the answer is 116.


To find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize, we use the conditional probability formula:

\[
P(\text{grand prize} | \text{prize}) = \frac{P(\text{grand prize})}{P(\text{prize})}
\]

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:

\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

**Calculating \(P(\text{grand prize})\):**

The probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the chosen numbers. There is only one such combination:

\[
P(\text{grand prize}) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

**Calculating \(P(\text{prize})\):**

To win a prize, Jen must have at least two of her numbers match. This includes three cases:

1. **Exactly two matches:** Choose 2 from Jen's 4 and 2 from the remaining 6:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

2. **Exactly three matches:** Choose 3 from Jen's 4 and 1 from the remaining 6:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

3. **Exactly four matches:** This is the grand prize case:
   \[
   \binom{4}{4} = 1
   \]
