Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The torus is made by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle and 6 units away from the center. So, it's like a donut shape. I remember that the torus has two important radii: the major radius, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, the minor radius is 3, and the major radius is 6.

Now, the problem mentions a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of the sphere and be internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and it can also rest on the outside, being externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so first, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize the situation. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. The key is to find the radii of these tangent circles.

Let me recall some properties of tori and spheres. The sphere has a fixed radius of 11. The torus, on the other hand, has a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. Wait, no, in the problem, the torus is made by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So, in torus terminology, the major radius is 6, and the minor radius is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus fits inside. The point of tangency will be at a point where the distance from the center of the sphere to the torus's surface is equal to 11. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is equal to 11 in the other direction.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the centers. Hmm. Let's denote the center of the sphere as point O. When the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from O to the center of the torus's tube (the center of the generating circle) would be such that the sphere and torus are tangent. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the distance from O to the torus's center is different.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus and sphere as surfaces in 3D space and find where they intersect.

But I think I can approach this using the geometry of the torus and the sphere. Let me consider the cross-sectional view, maybe a 2D slice.

Imagine looking at the torus along the axis of revolution. In this cross-section, the torus would look
