Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here involving a torus and a sphere. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the problem describes Torus T as the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, and the axis is a distance 6 from the center of the circle. So, I remember that a torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an external axis. The circle that's being revolved has radius 3, and the distance from the center of this circle to the axis of revolution is 6. 

So, I think the standard way to describe a torus is using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, R would be 6 and r would be 3. 

Now, the problem introduces a sphere S with radius 11. The torus T can rest inside and outside of this sphere. When it's inside, it's internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The question is about finding the difference r_i - r_o, which should be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then finding m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find these two tangent circles' radii when the torus is inside and outside the sphere, respectively. Let me think about how the torus and sphere would touch each other in these cases.

Starting with the internal tangent case: the torus is inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it touches the sphere externally along another circle. 

I should probably visualize the cross-section of this setup. If I imagine slicing both the torus and the sphere with a plane that contains the axis of the torus, I'll get a circle (from the torus) and a circle (from the sphere). The tangent points should lie along this plane, so maybe I can model this in 2D first.

In the cross-sectional view, the torus would look like two circles: one at distance R from the center (the major radius) with radius r, and the other on the opposite side. The sphere, when sliced, would be a circle with radius 11. 

Wait, no. Actually, the cross-section of a torus is a bit different. When you slice a torus along a plane that contains its axis, you get two circles. The distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is R, which is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is r, which is 3. So, the cross-section would consist of two circles, each of radius 3, centered at (6, 0) and (-6, 0) if the axis is along the x-axis.

But when considering the sphere, which is of radius 11, its cross-section would be a circle with radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's cross-section circle would enclose the torus's cross-section circles. 

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so when it's inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle.
