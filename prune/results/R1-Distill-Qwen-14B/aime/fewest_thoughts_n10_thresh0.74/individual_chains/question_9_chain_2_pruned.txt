Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help. Let me write down what I know.

First, log_x(y^x) = 10. Using logarithm properties, log_x(y^x) is the same as x * log_x(y), right? Because log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a). So that simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, maybe I can express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other. I remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) is the reciprocal of log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So substituting that into the equations:

1. x * A = 10
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

So now I have two equations with variables x, y, and A. Maybe I can solve for x and y in terms of A and then find A.

From equation 1: x = 10 / A.

From equation 2: 4y / A = 10. Let me solve for y.

Multiply both sides by A: 4y = 10 A.

Then divide by 4: y = (10 A)/4 = (5 A)/2.

So now I have x in terms of A and y in terms of A: x = 10/A, y = (5A)/2.

But I want to find xy, so maybe I can express xy in terms of A.

xy = (10/A) * (5A/2) = (10 * 5 * A) / (A * 2) ) = (50A) / (2A) = 25.

Wait, that's interesting. The A's cancel out, so xy is 25 regardless of the value of A. So is the answer 25? That seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting again, the two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Expressed as:

1. x * A = 10, where A = log_x(y)
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

So x = 10/A, y = (10 A)/(4) = 5A/2.

Then xy = (10/A) * (5A/2) = 25. Hmm, seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I should verify if these x and y satisfy the original logarithmic equations, just to be thorough.

Let me find A. Since A = log_x(y), and x = 10/A, y = (5A)/2.

So, log_x(y) = log_{10/A} (5A/2) = A.

Using the change of base formula, log_{10/A} (5A/2) = ln(5A/2) / ln(10/A).

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find A by relating the two expressions.

Wait, let me think about another approach. Maybe convert the logarithmic equations into exponential form.

First equation: log
