Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down what I know. The two equations are:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be manipulated using their properties. Maybe I can use the power rule, which says that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). Let me apply that to both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the base is x, and the exponent is x on y. So yeah, log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the power rule, this is 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. I think I can express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other. Remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x).

Let me let’s denote log_x(y) as A. Then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So substituting into the equations:

1. x * A = 10
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

So now I have:

Equation 1: xA = 10
Equation 2: (4y)/A = 10

From Equation 1, I can solve for x: x = 10 / A.

From Equation 2, solving for y: (4y)/A = 10 ⇒ 4y = 10A ⇒ y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2.

Now I have expressions for x and y in terms of A.

But I also know that log_x(y) = A. Since x and y are expressed in terms of A, maybe I can write log_x(y) = A and substitute x and y.

Let me write that equation. log_x(y) = A. Using the change of base formula, log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x) = A.

But I have expressions for x and y in terms of A:

x = 10/A

y = (5A)/2

So substituting these into the equation:

ln(y) / ln(x) = A

Let me plug in the values:

ln(5A/2) / ln(10/A) = A

Hmm, okay, so let's write that as:

[ln(5A/2)] / [ln(10/A)] = A

That's a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

Let me rewrite 5A/2 as (5/2)A and 10/A as (10)/A.

So:

ln((5/2)A) / ln(10/A) = A

I can use logarithm properties to break these down. Remember that ln(ab) = ln a + ln b.

So:

[ln(5/2) + ln(A)] / [ln(10) - ln(A)] = A

Let me denote ln(A) as t for simplicity. So t = ln(A). Then A = e^t.

So substituting:

[ln(5/2) + t] / [ln(10) - t] = e^t

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can cross-multiply:

ln(5/2) + t = e^t (ln(10) - t)

Let me rearrange terms:

ln(5/2) + t = e^t ln(10) - e^t t

Bring all terms to one side:

ln(5/2) + t - e^t ln(10) + e^t t = 0

This looks complicated. Maybe I can factor it a bit.

Looking at terms with t:

t(1 + e^t) + ln(5/2) - e^t ln(10) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps this equation can be solved numerically, but since it's a problem for competition, maybe there's a clever substitution or integer values that satisfy it.

Wait, another approach: Maybe instead of using substitution with A, try to relate the two expressions for x and y.

From earlier, x = 10/A and y = (5A)/2.

But also, A = log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x). So maybe I can write A in terms of x and y.

Wait, but we already have expressions for x and y in terms of A. Maybe I can write another equation involving A.

Alternatively, consider that x and y are related through A, so perhaps I can find a relationship between x and y.

Wait, let me think. Since x = 10/A and y = (5A)/2, maybe I can express A in terms of x, and then plug into the equation involving y.

Wait, from x = 10/A, so A = 10/x.

And from y = (5A)/2, substituting A = 10/x, y = (5*(10/x))/2 = (50)/(2x) )= 25/x.

So y = 25/x.

So now I have that y = 25/x.

So, since y = 25/x, and x and y are both greater than 1, so 25/x >1 ⇒ x <25.

So x is between 1 and 25.

Now, going back to the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10.

Wait, that equation was simplified to x * log_x(y) =10.

But log_x(y) is A, which is
