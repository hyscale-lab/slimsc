Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It's about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Also, when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0,0,8 and the bottom row is 9,9,1. Let me try to understand this better.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So, the top row has three cells, and the bottom row has three cells. When I read left to right, the top row forms a three-digit number, and the bottom row forms another three-digit number. Their sum should be 999.

Then, when I read top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So there are three such numbers, and their sum should be 99.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. For the vertical reading, each column is a two-digit number because each column has two cells, one in the top row and one in the bottom row. So, the sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

Let me denote the cells with variables to make it easier. Let me label the grid as follows:

Top row: A, B, C
Bottom row: D, E, F

So, the numbers formed horizontally are ABC (a three-digit number) and DEF (another three-digit number). Their sum is 999.

Vertically, each column forms a two-digit number: AD, BE, CF. Their sum is 99.

So, the equations I can write are:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit from 0 to 9. But wait, for ABC and DEF being three-digit numbers, A and D can't be zero, right? Because a three-digit number can't start with zero. Similarly, for the vertical numbers AD, BE, CF, their first digit (A, B, C) can't be zero because those are the top digits. Wait, no, actually, the vertical numbers are two-digit numbers, so A, D, B, E, C, F are digits in each position, but the two-digit numbers would be AD, BE, CF. So AD is a two-digit number, so A can't be zero because it's the first digit of a two-digit number. Similarly, B and C can't be zero for the same reason. Wait, but in the example given, the top row has 0,0,8. Wait, but then AD would be 09, which is just 9, a single-digit number. But the problem says each cell is a digit, but when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, the grid in the example is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

So, when reading top to bottom, each column is 09, 09, 81. So 09 is 9, 09 is 9, and 81 is 81. So, the sum is 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. So, in this case, the top digits can be zero, but the vertical numbers are two-digit numbers, but with the top digit possibly zero. So, AD is 09, which is 9, but it's treated as a two-digit number, maybe leading zeros allowed? Hmm, but in reality, 09 is just 9, but for the sum, perhaps they are considered as two-digit numbers, which would include the leading zero, so 09 is 9, not 90.

Wait, but if we consider 09 as 09, then each vertical number is two digits, but leading zeros are allowed. So, in that case, the sum would be 09 + 09 + 81 = 99. So, yes, each vertical number is treated as a two-digit number, allowing leading zeros. So, that means A, B, C can be zero because they are the top digits in the vertical numbers, but when combined with D, E, F, they form two-digit numbers. So, for example, A can be zero, making AD a two-digit number with A=0 and D as the units digit.

So, with that in mind, each cell can be digits from 0 to 9, including zero. So, no restrictions on leading digits except where necessary for the horizontal numbers. For the horizontal numbers, ABC and DEF, since they are three-digit numbers, A and D must be non-zero. Because, for example, ABC cannot be 008, it must be 008 as a three-digit number, but actually, 008 is just 8, which is a one-digit number. Wait, no, the problem says "the two numbers formed by reading left to right." So, perhaps ABC is a three-digit number, meaning A, B, C can be any digits, but A can't be zero because otherwise, it's not a three-digit number. Similarly, D can't be zero because DEF is a three-digit number.

So, to clarify:

- ABC is a three-digit number, so A ≠ 0
- DEF is a three-digit number, so D ≠ 0
- AD, BE, CF are two-digit numbers, so A, B, C can be zero (since AD is a two-digit number starting with A, which can be zero)

So, in the example, A=0 would make ABC=008, which is 8, a single-digit number, but perhaps the problem allows for that. Wait, no, the problem says "the two numbers formed by reading left to right." So, if A is zero, reading left to right would give a three-digit number, but it's just 008, which is 8. So, maybe the problem expects that ABC and DEF are three-digit numbers, meaning A and D can't be zero. Otherwise, the example given has A=0, which would make ABC=008, which is 8, but the sum is 8 + 991 = 999, which is correct. So perhaps the problem allows for ABC and DEF to be three-digit numbers with leading zeros, so they can effectively be numbers from 000 to 999, but with A and D non-zero. Wait, no, because if A is zero, ABC is 000 to 099, but leading zeros are allowed in the grid.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the example again. The example grid is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

So, ABC is 008, which is 8, and DEF is 991, which is 991. 8 + 991 = 999, so that works. But ABC is 008, which is a three-digit number with leading zeros allowed. So, perhaps in the problem, ABC and DEF are considered as three-digit numbers, meaning A and D can be zero, but when their values are taken, leading zeros are allowed, making ABC a number from 000 to 999.

So, in that case, A can be zero, as in the example. So, the initial assumption that A and D can't be zero is incorrect. So, all digits from A, B, C, D, E, F can be zero to nine. But in the example, A is zero, so the horizontal numbers can have leading zeros, but the vertical numbers can have leading zeros as well, as in the example where AD is 09.

So, to avoid confusion, perhaps the problem allows all digits to be zero, and when forming the numbers, leading zeros are allowed. So, ABC can be 000, which is 0, and similarly for DEF.

Given that, the problem is to assign digits to each cell such that:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit (0-9).

Let me think about how to approach this. It's a system of equations, but with digits, so each digit has to be between 0 and 9, inclusive.

Let me first consider the horizontal condition: ABC + DEF = 999.

Since ABC and DEF are three-digit numbers (with leading zeros allowed), their sum is 999. So, ABC is some number from 0 to 999, and DEF is 999 - ABC.

Similarly, the vertical condition is that AD + BE + CF = 99.

Each of AD, BE, CF is a two-digit number, so each can be from 00 to 99, but since A, B, C are digits, AD is 10*A + D, BE is 10*B + E, CF is 10*C + F.

Wait, no. Wait, AD is a two-digit number formed by A and D, meaning A is the tens digit and D is the units digit. So, AD = 10*A + D. Similarly, BE = 10*B + E, CF = 10*C + F. So, the sum is (10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99.

So, let me write that equation:

10*A + D + 10*B + E + 10*C + F = 99.

I can factor this:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Similarly, the horizontal sum is ABC + DEF = 999. Let me express ABC and DEF in terms of their digits:

ABC = 100*A + 10*B + C

DEF = 100*D + 10*E + F

So, ABC + DEF = 100*A + 10*B + C + 100*D + 10*E + F = 999.

Which simplifies to:

100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Now, I have two equations:

1. 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999
2. 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

Let me denote some variables to make this easier.

Let me let S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F.

Then, equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation 2: 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Let me denote S4 = A + B + C and S5 = D + E + F. Then equation 2 is:

10*S4 + S5 = 99.

So, now, I have:

Equation 1: 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation 2: 10*S4 + S5 = 99.

We also have:

S1 = A + D

S2 = B + E

S3 = C + F

S4 = A + B + C

S5 = D + E + F

So, perhaps I can find relations between these variables.

Let me think about S1, S2, S3. Each of S1, S2, S3 is the sum of two digits. So, each can be between 0+0=0 and 9+9=18.

Similarly, S4 and S5 are sums of three digits each, so each can be between 0 and 27.

Looking at equation 2: 10*S4 + S5 = 99.

Since S4 and S5 are integers, 10*S4 must be less than or equal to 99, so S4 can be at most 9 (since 10*9=90, and 99-90=9). Similarly, S4 must be at least 0. So, S4 is between 0 and 9.

Similarly, S5 = 99 - 10*S4.

Since S5 is the sum of three digits (D, E, F), which can be up to 27, but 99 - 10*S4 must be ≤27, so 99 - 10*S4 ≤27 → 10*S4 ≥72 → S4 ≥7.2. Since S4 is integer, S4 ≥8.

But S4 is also ≤9.

So, S4 can be 8 or 9.

Let me consider these two cases:

Case 1: S4 = 8.

Then, S5 = 99 - 10*8 = 99 - 80 = 19.

Case 2: S4 =9.

Then, S5=99 - 10*9=99-90=9.

So, S4 can be 8 or 9.

Now, let's look at equation 1:

100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 =999.

We can think of this as a number in base 1000, but perhaps it's better to break it down.

Since S1, S2, S3 are sums of digits, their possible ranges are:

S1: 0 ≤ S1 ≤18

S2: same

S3: same

But 100*S1 can be up to 1800, which is more than 999, but in our case, 100*S1 must be ≤999, so S1 can be at most 9, because 100*10=1000>999.

Wait, but 100*S1 is part of 999, so S1 can be 0 to 9, as 100*9=900 ≤999.

So, S1 is in 0-9.

Similarly, 10*S2 can be up to 170 (if S2=17), but in our case, 10*S2 is part of 999, so 10*S2 ≤999, so S2 can be up to 99, but since S2 is sum of two digits, it's up to 18.

But given that 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3=999, and S1 is at most 9, 100*9=900. Then, 10*S2 + S3=99.

Wait, that's similar to equation 2.

Wait, equation 1: 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3=999.

Equation 2: 10*S4 + S5=99.

Wait, S4 = A + B + C, and S5 = D + E + F.

But S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F.

So, S4 + S5 = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = S1 + S2 + S3.

But from equation 2, S4 + S5 = (99 - S5) + S5? Wait, no, equation 2 says 10*S4 + S5=99, so S4 and S5 are related.

Wait, let me compute S1 + S2 + S3.

S1 + S2 + S3 = (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = S4 + S5.

But from equation 2, 10*S4 + S5 =99.

So, S4 + S5 = (99 - 9*S4).

Wait, that may not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express S4 + S5 in terms of equation 2.

Wait, equation 2: 10*S4 + S5 =99.

I can write S5 =99 -10*S4.

Then, S4 + S5 = S4 + (99 -10*S4) = 99 -9*S4.

So, S1 + S2 + S3 =99 -9*S4.

But from equation 1: 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3=999.

I can write equation 1 as:

100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 =999.

Let me write this as:

99*S1 + (10*S2 + S3 - S1) =999 -99=900.

Wait, perhaps that's not the best approach. Alternatively, let me think of equation 1 as:

100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 =999.

Which can be written as:

100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Let me let T = 10*S2 + S3.

Then, equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + T =999.

But T =10*S2 + S3.

Also, from equation 2, 10*S4 + S5=99.

And S4 + S5 = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = S1 + S2 + S3.

Let me also note that S1 + S2 + S3 = (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = S4 + S5.

But from equation 2, 10*S4 + S5 =99 → S5 =99 -10*S4.

So, S4 + S5 = S4 + (99 -10*S4) =99 -9*S4.

Thus, S1 + S2 + S3 =99 -9*S4.

Now, from equation 1, 100*S1 + T=999, where T=10*S2 + S3.

So, S2 and S3 are digits sums, so S2 can be 0 to 18, S3 can be 0 to18.

So, T can be 0*10 +0=0 up to 18*10 +18=198.

But in equation 1, 100*S1 + T=999, so T=999 -100*S1.

Since S1 is at least 0 and at most 9, 100*S1 can be from 0 to 900.

So, T=999 -100*S1.

But T must be >=0 and <=198.

So, 0 <= 999 -100*S1 <=198.

Which implies:

999 -198 <=100*S1 <=999

So, 801 <=100*S1 <=999.

But 100*S1 must be a multiple of 100, so possible values are 900.

Because 801 <=100*S1 <=999, and 100*S1 is 100, 200,...,900.

So, 100*S1=900 → S1=9.

Because 100*9=900, which is in the range.

So, S1=9.

Then, T=999 -900=99.

So, equation 1 reduces to S1=9 and T=99.

So, from equation 1:

S1=9 → A + D=9.

T=10*S2 + S3=99.

So, 10*S2 + S3=99.

Which implies that S2 is the tens digit of 99, which is 9, and S3 is the units digit, which is9.

Wait, no, 10*S2 + S3=99 → S2=9, S3=9.

Because 10*9 +9=99.

So, S2=9 and S3=9.

Thus, from equation 1, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Now, let's go back to the other equation, equation 2, which is:

10*S4 + S5=99.

And S4 + S5=99 -9*S4.

Wait, earlier, I found that S4 can be 8 or9.

Wait, let me re-examine that.

From equation 2: 10*S4 + S5=99.

We have S5=99 -10*S4.

Also, S4 + S5 =99 -9*S4.

But from earlier, S4 + S5 = S1 + S2 + S3=9+9+9=27.

So, 99 -9*S4=27 → 99 -27=9*S4 → 72=9*S4 → S4=8.

So, S4=8.

Then, S5=99 -10*8=19.

So, S4=8, S5=19.

So, now, let's summarize:

From equation 1:

S1=A + D=9.

S2=B + E=9.

S3=C + F=9.

From equation 2:

S4=A + B + C=8.

S5=D + E + F=19.

So, now, we have S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

And S4=8, S5=19.

So, we can model the constraints as:

1. A + D =9
2. B + E=9
3. C + F=9
4. A + B + C=8
5. D + E + F=19

Now, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to these equations where A, B, C, D, E, F are digits (0-9).

So, each variable is between 0 and 9, inclusive.

So, let's think about how to model this.

We have variables A, B, C, D, E, F.

Constraints:

A + D =9 → D=9 - A.

B + E=9 → E=9 - B.

C + F=9 → F=9 - C.

A + B + C=8.

D + E + F=19.

Substituting D, E, F in terms of A, B, C into the fifth equation:

D + E + F= (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) = 27 - (A + B + C) =27 - S4=27 -8=19.

Which matches. So, the fifth equation is automatically satisfied if the first three equations are satisfied and S4=8.

So, our main constraints are:

A + D=9 → D=9 - A.

B + E=9 → E=9 - B.

C + F=9 → F=9 - C.

And A + B + C=8.

With A, B, C, D, E, F being digits from 0 to9.

So, since D=9 - A, and D must be a digit (0-9), 9 - A must be between 0 and9. So, A can be from0 to9, but D must be non-negative. So, A can be 0 to9, but D=9 - A must also be a digit, so A can be 0 to9.

Similarly, for B and C.

But we also have A + B + C=8.

So, A, B, C are digits (0-9) such that their sum is 8.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, where A, B, C are between 0 and9.

But since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each variable can be at most 8, as their sum is 8.

So, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, with A, B, C ≤9.

But since 8 is small, the constraints A, B, C ≤9 are automatically satisfied because each variable is at least 0 and their sum is 8. So, none of them can exceed 8, which is less than9.

So, the number of solutions is C(8 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

But wait, that's the number of non-negative integer solutions without constraints, but since each variable can't exceed 9, which is already the case here, as A + B + C=8, each variable is at most 8, which is less than9. So, the number is indeed 45.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C =8 is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

Yes, that's correct.

But wait, are there any additional constraints? For example, D=9 - A must be a digit, but since A can be from0 to9, D is from9 down to0, which are all digits.

Similarly, E=9 - B and F=9 - C.

So, for each solution (A, B, C), we get D, E, F as 9 - A, 9 - B, 9 - C.

So, for each solution, we have a unique grid.

Therefore, the number of such grids is equal to the number of solutions (A, B, C), which is45.

Wait, but hold on a second.

We also need to ensure that D, E, F are digits, i.e., non-negative integers less than or equal to9.

Since D=9 - A, if A is a digit (0-9), D will be 9 - A, which is also a digit (0-9).

Similarly for E and F.

So, all constraints are satisfied.

Therefore, the total number of such grids is45.

But wait, the example given is one such grid. So, the answer should be45.

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, is every solution (A, B, C) with A + B + C=8, and A, B, C digits, allowed?

Yes, because D, E, F will be 9 - A, 9 - B, 9 - C, which are digits, as 9 - A is between0 and9.

So, yes, each such solution corresponds to a grid.

Therefore, the number is45.

But wait, in the example, A=0, B=0, C=8.

Which gives D=9, E=9, F=1.

Which satisfies A + B + C=0+0+8=8.

So, that's one of the solutions.

So, how many such solutions are there?

The number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8 is45.

Hence, the number of grids is45.

Wait, but let me check with another example.

Let me take A=1, B=2, C=5.

Then D=8, E=7, F=4.

Check the vertical sum: AD=18, BE=27, CF=54.

Sum: 18 +27 +54=99. Correct.

Horizontal sum: ABC=125, DEF=874.

125 +874=999. Correct.

So, this is another valid grid.

So, each solution (A,B,C) gives a valid grid.

Hence, the total number of grids is45.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any constraints that I missed?

Wait, in the problem statement, the example uses A=0, B=0, C=8. So, digits can be zero, as long as the sum conditions are satisfied.

Hence, the conclusion is that the number of such grids is45.


To solve the problem, we analyze the 2x3 grid where each cell contains a digit. The grid must satisfy two conditions:

1. The sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by reading the grid left to right (ABC and DEF) is 999.
2. The sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by reading the grid top to bottom (AD, BE, CF) is 99.

We denote the grid as follows:

```
A B C
D E F
```

### Key Equations:
1. **Horizontal Sum**:  
   \( ABC + DEF = 999 \)  
   Expanding, \( 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999 \).

2. **Vertical Sum**:  
   \( AD + BE + CF = 99 \)  
   Expanding, \( 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99 \).

### Simplifying the Equations:
Let \( S_1 = A + D \), \( S_2 = B + E \), \( S_3 = C + F \). Then:
1. \( 100S_1 + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999 \).
2. \( 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99 \).

Let \( S_4 = A + B + C \) and \( S_5 = D + E + F \). Then:
1. \( 100S_1 + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999 \).
2. \( 10S_4 + S_5 = 99 \).

### Solving for \( S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5 \):
From the second equation:
- \( S_5 = 99 - 10S_4 \).
- \( S_4 + S_5 = 99 - 9S_4 \).

From the first equation:
- \( 100S_1 + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999 \).
- Let \( T = 10S_2 + S_3 \), so \( 100S_1 + T = 999 \).

Since \( T = 99 \) and \( S_1 = 9 \), we find:
- \( S_1 = 9 \), \( S_2 = 9 \), \( S_3 = 9 \).
- \( S_4 = 8 \), \( S_5 = 19 \).

### Constraints on Variables:
- \( A + D = 9 \).
- \( B + E = 9 \).
- \( C + F = 9 \).
- \( A + B + C = 8 \).

### Number of Solutions:
We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( A + B + C = 8 \), where \( A, B, C \) are digits (0-9). The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars method:
\[ \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45. \]

Thus, there are **45** valid grids.

\boxed{45}
