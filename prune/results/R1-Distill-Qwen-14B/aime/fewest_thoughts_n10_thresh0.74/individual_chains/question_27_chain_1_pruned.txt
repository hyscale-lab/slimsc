Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, and the distance from the center of that circle to the axis is 6. So, I remember that a torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution, kind of like a donut shape. The circle being revolved has radius 3, and the distance from its center to the axis of revolution is 6. So, I think the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of S, meaning it's inside the sphere and tangent to it along a circle. Similarly, it can rest on the outside, meaning it's outside the sphere and tangent along another circle. The problem asks for the difference between the radii of these two circles, ri - ro, and then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Finally, we need to find m + n.

Hmm. So, I need to find the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases.

I think the key here is to model the torus and the sphere mathematically and then find the points of tangency.

Let me recall the equations for a torus and a sphere.

The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is:

((sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z²) = r²

In this case, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So, the equation becomes:

(sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

And the sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is:

x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121

Now, when the torus rests inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they are tangent along another circle.

I think in both cases, the point of tangency lies on a circle that's in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, maybe? Because the torus is symmetric around the z-axis, I suppose.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle of tangency lies in a plane that's perpendicular to the axis of the torus. Since the torus's axis is the z-axis, the tangency circle should be in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, like a horizontal plane.

Wait, but the sphere is also symmetric around its center, which I assume is at the origin because the torus is centered at the origin.

Let me think about the internal tangency first.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the point of tangency is the closest point from the torus to the origin. Similarly, for external tangency, it's the farthest point.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think.

The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The torus is a surface, and it's tangent to the sphere along a circle. The distance from the origin to the center
