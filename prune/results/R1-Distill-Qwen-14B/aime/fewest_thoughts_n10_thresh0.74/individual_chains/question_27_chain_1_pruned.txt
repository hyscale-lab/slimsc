Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that lies in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the torus T has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution is 6. So, when they say the generating circle has a radius of 3, that must be the minor radius of the torus. The major radius, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis, is 6.

Then, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem is about the torus resting inside and outside the sphere and being tangent along circles. When it's inside, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, tangent along r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to find expressions for r_i and r_o. Let me try to understand the geometry here.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, and the torus touches it from the inside. The point of tangency would be a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

I remember that the sphere and torus being tangent along a circle implies that at the point of tangency, their surfaces share a common tangent plane. So, perhaps the centers are aligned in a way that the line connecting their centers passes through the point of tangency.

Wait, but the torus is a surface of revolution, so maybe I can model it using coordinates. Let me consider the standard equation of a torus. The torus can be represented parametrically, but maybe using the equation in terms of x, y, z.

The standard torus equation is: (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z² = r², where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. In our case, R is 6, and r is 3. So, the equation becomes (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9.

The sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, when the torus rests inside the sphere, the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle of the torus is such that the two surfaces are tangent. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, so they're tangent again.

But wait, the torus is a surface in 3D space. When it's inside the sphere, the sphere is bigger, so the point of tangency is the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere
