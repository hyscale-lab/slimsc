Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what's being asked. 

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable, meaning I can't tell one white chip from another, same with black. The grid has 25 cells, each can hold at most one chip. 

The conditions are:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip. So no two chips in the same cell, which I guess means each cell is either occupied by one chip or none.

2. All chips in the same row must be the same color. So if I look at any row, all the chips in that row are white or all are black. Similarly, all chips in the same column must be the same color. So each column is uniformly colored as well.

3. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So the placement is maximal; you can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column color rules.

So I need to count the number of ways to place some chips on the grid following these rules.

Hmm, let's think about the constraints. Each row and each column must be uniformly colored, and we can't add any more chips. So if a row has some chips, they're all the same color, and the same for the columns.

Wait, but a row and a column must agree on their colors where they intersect. For example, if row 1 is white and column 1 is black, then cell (1,1) would need to be both white and black, which is impossible. So that suggests that the color assignments for the rows and columns must not conflict at their intersections.

Therefore, the coloring of the grid must be such that every row and every column has a single color, and where a row and column intersect, their colors must match. So this sounds like a grid that's divided into rectangles of a single color, but because each row and column must be uniform, this must be a grid that's split into four quadrants or something?

Wait, maybe not necessarily four quadrants. Let me think. Perhaps the grid is divided into rectangles where each rectangle is a block of the same color, and the rows and columns are partitioned accordingly.

But since each row is entirely one color, and each column is entirely one color, the grid must be a union of rectangles where each rectangle is a block of a single color, and the rows and columns are divided in a way that these blocks don't interfere with the row and column uniformity.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the color of each row and each column must form a bipartition. Let me consider that each row can be either white or black, and each column can be either white or black. But the color assignments can't conflict where rows and columns intersect. So for any cell (i,j), the color of row i and column j must be the same.

So when would this happen? For example, if all rows are white, then all columns must be white as well. But that's not the case because we can have a mix. Let's think about it: if row i is white, then every column that intersects row i at a cell with a chip must also be white. But wait, if a cell is filled, then its row and column must be the same color. So if a cell is filled, the row and column must have that color. 

But wait, the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip, and that the placement is maximal. So that means that for every empty cell, adding a chip there would cause a conflict. So, for an empty cell (i,j), either row i is already colored with a different color, or column j is already colored with a different color, or both.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a bipartition of the grid. Let me think in terms of the colors assigned to rows and columns.

Suppose I assign a color to each row (white or black) and a color to each column (white or black). Then, for a cell (i,j), it can have a chip only if the row color and column color are the same, and in that case, the cell is filled with a chip of that color
