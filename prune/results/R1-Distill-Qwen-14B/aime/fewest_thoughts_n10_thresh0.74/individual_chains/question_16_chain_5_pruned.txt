Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's looking for the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared (p²). Once I find that prime p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is also divisible by p². So, there's a two-step process here: find p, then find m.

I remember that primes where p divides n⁴ + 1 must satisfy certain conditions. For a prime p, if there's a solution to n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p. I think this relates to whether p ≡ 1 mod 8 or something like that. Wait, let me think. For -1 to be a quadratic residue, p must be 1 mod 4. But for higher powers, like fourth powers, the conditions are stricter.

I recall that for the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, p must be congruent to 1 mod 8. Because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, so the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p implies that the order of -1 must divide (p-1)/2, but since -1 has order 2, maybe 8 divides p-1? Hmm, not entirely sure, but I think that's the case.

So, the primes p for which n⁴ +1 is divisible by p must satisfy p ≡ 1 mod 8. So the smallest primes to check are 17, 97, etc. Wait, no, 17 is 1 mod 8 (17-1=16, which is 2⁴), but 17 is the 7th prime. Let me list primes: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,... So the first prime that is 1 mod 8 is 17. But wait, 17 is 1 mod 8, so maybe that's our p.

But wait, the question is about p² dividing n⁴ +1. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where there exists an n such that p² divides n⁴ +1.

So, let's start with p=2. Let me check if n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. For n even, n=2k, so n⁴=16k⁴, which is 0 mod 4. Then n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod 4, which isn't 0. For n odd, n=2k+1, so n²=4k(k+1)+1, which is 1 mod 4. So n⁴=(n²)² ≡1²=1 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod 4, which is not divisible by 4. So p=2 is out because p²=4 doesn't divide any n⁴ +1.

Next, p=3. Let's check if 9 divides n⁴ +1.

Compute n⁴ mod 9. The possible residues mod 9 are 0,1,2,...,8. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=0 to 8.

n | n⁴ mod 9:
0 | 0
1 | 1
2 | 16 mod9=7
3 | 0
4 | (4²=16 mod9=7; 7²=49 mod9=4)
5 | (5²=25 mod9=7; 7²=49 mod9=4)
6 | 0
7 | same as n=2, since 7 ≡ -2 mod9. 7²=49=4, 4²=16=7. So 7⁴=7 mod9.
8 | same as n=8, which is -1 mod9. (-1)^4=1 mod9.

So n⁴ mod9 can be 0,1,4,7. So n⁴ +1 mod9 can be 1,2,5,8.

Looking for n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod9, which would require n⁴ ≡8 mod9. But from above, n⁴ mod9 can't be 8. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5. Check if 25 divides n⁴ +1.

First, check if 5 divides n⁴ +1. So n⁴ ≡-1 mod5. Let's compute n⁴ mod5 for n=0 to 4.

n | n⁴ mod5:
0 | 0
1 | 1
2 | 16 mod5=1
3 | 81 mod5=1
4 | 256 mod5=1

So n⁴ mod5 is either 0 or 1. So n⁴ ≡-1 mod5 would mean 1≡-1 mod5, which implies 2≡0 mod5. That's false. So p=5 is out.

Next prime p=7. Let me see if 49 divides n⁴ +1. First, check if 7 divides n⁴ +1.

Compute n⁴ mod7. Let's list n from 0 to 6.

n | n⁴ mod7:
0 | 0
1 |1
2 |16 mod7=2
3 |81 mod7=4 (since 7*11=77, 81-77=4)
4 |256 mod7: 256 /7 is 36*7=252, 256-252=4. So 4.
Wait, is that right? 4²=16≡2, then 2²=4. So yeah, 4⁴ mod
