Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob play a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about game theory here. This sounds like a classic combinatorial game where we can determine winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a winning position is one where the current player can force a win.

So, the idea is to find all n where Bob can win, given that Alice is trying to win as well. Since Bob is the second player, for him to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice, the first player.

I'll start by analyzing small values of n to see if I can find a pattern.

Let's list n from 0 upwards and determine if each is a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n=0: Well, if there are no tokens left, the player who just moved has won. So, the current player cannot move and loses. Therefore, n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So W.

n=2: Take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take 1 and win. Or, take 1, but wait, if you take 1, opponent is left with n=1 and can win. So, wait, maybe n=2 is a losing position? No, wait, let me think again.

Wait, if n=2, you can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take that last token and win. Alternatively, can you take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So you can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can win. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position? But wait, if you have n=2, you can take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. Or, wait, perhaps I have this wrong. Wait, the person who takes the last token wins. So, if I'm at n=2, I take 1
