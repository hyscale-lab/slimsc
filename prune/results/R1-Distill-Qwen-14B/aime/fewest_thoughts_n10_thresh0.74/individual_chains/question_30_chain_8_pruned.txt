Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that helps here.

The given product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that down:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I wonder if this product can be simplified or related to some known polynomial. Maybe I can factor each term or find a pattern.

Let me first compute each term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for a specific k. Let's denote this term as P(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Wait, maybe I can rewrite this term. Let's see:

P(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}
     = 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2
     = (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2

Hmm, that's a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor this quadratic or find its roots. Let me try to factor it.

Let me consider x^2 - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, P(k) = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the product becomes:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Hmm, so that's the product over all 13th roots of unity ω^k (including ω^0 = 1) of (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b), where a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.

I remember that for a polynomial f(x) with roots r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, the product ∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - r_k) = f(x). But here, we have the product over all roots of unity of (x - a)(x - b), which would be related to evaluating the cyclotomic polynomial at a and b.

Wait, more precisely, the product over all ω^k (k=0 to 12) of (ω^k - a) is equal to Φ_13(a), since Φ_13(x) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k). Similarly for b.

Wait, no, actually, Φ_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots of unity. But since ω is a primitive 13th root, ω^k for k=1 to 12 are all the primitive roots, but when k=0, ω^0 = 1 is not a primitive root. So I'm not sure if that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall that ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1, because all ω^k are the roots of x^13 - 1. So, indeed, x^13 - 1 = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k).

Therefore, if I set x = a, then ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1. Similarly, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (b - ω^k) = b^13 - 1.

Wait, but in our case, the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b) = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a)] × [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - b)] = (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).

But wait, let me see: ∏ (ω^k - a) = ∏ (a - ω^k) × (-1)^{13}, because each term is multiplied by (-1). Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. Therefore, ∏ (ω^k - a) = (-1)^{13} ∏ (a - ω^k) = - (a^13 - 1). Similarly for b: ∏ (ω^k - b) = - (b^13 - 1).

Therefore, our original product is:

Product = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a)] × [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - b)] = (- (a^13 - 1)) × (- (b^13 - 1)) = (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).

Wait, hold on: [∏ (ω^k - a)] = (-1)^13 × ∏ (a - ω^k) = - (a^13 - 1). Similarly, [∏ (ω^k - b)] = - (b^13 - 1).

Therefore, multiplying them together gives:

Product = (- (a^13 - 1)) × (- (b^13 - 1)) = (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).

So, our Product is (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1), where a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.

Now, I need to compute ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) multiplied by ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ). Let's compute each term separately.

First, compute (1 + i)^13. Let me recall that 1 + i is a complex number. Its polar form is sqrt(2) e^{i π/4}, since |1 + i| = sqrt(2) and the angle is 45 degrees or π/4 radians.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 × e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 × e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 × 2^{1/2} = 64 × sqrt(2).

Next, let's handle the exponents.

For (1 + i)^13: the angle is 13 * π/4. Let's compute 13 * π/4 modulo 2π.

13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 * 2π is 6π, but that's in terms of fractions. Let me compute 13 * π/4:

13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4. 3π is the same as π modulo 2π because 3π = 2π + π. So 3π + π/4 = π + π/4 = 5π/4. Therefore, e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i * 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).

Similarly, for (1 - i)^13: the angle is -13π/4, which is the same as -13π/4 + 4π (since adding 4π doesn't change the angle). 4π is 16π/4, so -13π/4 + 16π/4 = 3π/4. So e^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{i * 3π/4} = cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].

Let me compute this:

First, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.

Similarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * [ (-1) - i ] = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ]

Compute:

sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1.

sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = i * 2 / 2 = i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * [ (-1) + i ] = -64 + 64i.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, actually, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i 5π/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) ].

cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So, 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(
