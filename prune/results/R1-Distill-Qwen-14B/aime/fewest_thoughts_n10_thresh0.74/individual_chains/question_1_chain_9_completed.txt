Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2) first.

Wait, perhaps let me express all variables in terms of x.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z => y z = x / 2^(1/2) = x * 2^(-1/2)

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

So, substitute y from equation (2) into y z:

(2^(1/3) x z) * z = x * 2^(-1/2)

So,

2^(1/3) x z^2 = x * 2^(-1/2)

Divide both sides by x (since x is positive, not zero):

2^(1/3) z^2 = 2^(-1/2)

So, z^2 = 2^(-1/2) / 2^(1/3) = 2^(-1/2 - 1/3)

Compute the exponent: -1/2 -1/3 is -3/6 - 2/6 = -5/6.

So, z^2 = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12)

Since z is positive.

Now, from equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y

We have z = 2^(-5/12), x = 2^(-7/24), so let's substitute:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * 2^(-7/24) * y

Simplify the right side:

2^(1/4) is 2^(6/24), 2^(-7/24) is as is. Multiply the exponents by adding:

2^(6/24 -7/24) = 2^(-1/24)

So, right side is 2^(-1/24) * y

Thus,

2^(-5/12) = 2^(-1/24) * y

Solve for y:

y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-1/24) = 2^(-5/12 + 1/24)

Convert to same denominator: -10/24 + 1/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.

So, y = 2^(-3/8)

So now, I have expressions for x, y, z:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me write all exponents with denominator 24 to see if that helps.

x: exponent is -7/24

y: exponent is -3/8 = -9/24

z: exponent is -5/12 = -10/24

So, x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24)

Now, I need to compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let's write that expression.

First, let's compute x^4 y^3 z^2:

x^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y^3 = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)

z^2 = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them together:

2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)

Combine the exponents. Let's find a common denominator. 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each exponent:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Add them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)

Therefore, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

But the question asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | = 25/8

So, 25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³. They share no common prime factors.

Thus, m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, I'm a bit concerned about the step when I solved for z. Let me go back.

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y

But from equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

So, substituting x into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * [2^(1/2) y z] * y

Wait, that might be a better approach. Let's try that.

z = 2^(1/4) * x * y = 2^(1/4) * (2^(1/2) y z) * y

Simplify:

z = 2^(1/4 + 1/2) * y^2 z

Compute exponents: 1/4 + 1/2 is 3/4.

So, z = 2^(3/4) y^2 z

Bring z to the left:

z - 2^(3/4) y^2 z = 0 => z (1 - 2^(3/4) y^2) = 0

Since z is positive, 1 - 2^(3/4) y^2 = 0 => y^2 = 2^(-3/4)

Thus, y = 2^(-3/8), which is the same as before. So that step was correct.

Then from equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We have y = 2^(-3/8), so:

2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/3) x z

So, x z = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(1/3) = 2^(-3/8 - 8/24) since 1/3 is 8/24.

Wait, 3/8 is 9/24, so -3/8 = -9/24, and 1/3 is 8/24.

So, exponent is -9/24 - 8/24 = -17/24.

So, x z = 2^(-17/24)

But from equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We can use x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12), so x z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 10/24) = 2^(-17/24), which matches. So that's correct.

So, my earlier calculations seem correct.

So, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8, so m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

I think that's solid.


To solve the given system of equations involving logarithms, we start by rewriting each equation in exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\).

From these, we express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:

- \(x = 2^{1/2} y z\)
- \(y = 2^{1/3} x z\)
- \(z = 2^{1/4} x y\)

Substituting \(y = 2^{1/3} x z\) into \(z = 2^{1/4} x y\), we get:

\[
z = 2^{1/4} x (2^{1/3} x z) = 2^{7/12} x^2 z
\]

Solving for \(z\), we find:

\[
z (1 - 2^{7/12} x^2) = 0 \implies x^2 = 2^{-7/12} \implies x = 2^{-7/24}
\]

Next, substituting \(x = 2^{-7/24}\) into \(y = 2^{1/3} x z\) and solving for \(y\), we find:

\[
y = 2^{-3/8}
\]

Similarly, substituting \(x = 2^{-7/24}\) and \(y = 2^{-3/8}\) into \(z = 2^{1/4} x y\), we find:

\[
z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

Now, we compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

\[
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \quad y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \quad z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]

Multiplying these together:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6} = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Thus,

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \(\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Therefore, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
