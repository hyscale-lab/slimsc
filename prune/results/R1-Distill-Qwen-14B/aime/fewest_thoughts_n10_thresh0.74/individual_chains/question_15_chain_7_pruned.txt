Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, first, let me make sure I understand the grid. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 squares along each side, right? So the grid has lines that form 9x9 intersection points. But when we talk about moving from the lower left to the upper right, we're moving from (0,0) to (8,8) in a grid where each move is either right or up.

Wait, but the problem mentions paths of length 16. To go from (0,0) to (8,8), you need 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves. So each path is a sequence of 16 steps, each either right or up. So the total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But that's the total number without considering direction changes.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, what does it mean to change direction? Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, etc., each time it switches from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change.

Wait, but in a path from (0,0) to (8,8), the path must consist of alternating runs of right and up moves. So, the number of direction changes is related to how many times the path switches between these two directions.

Let me think: If a path has exactly four direction changes, how does that break down? Let's see, each direction change corresponds to a switch between right and up. So, if we start with a right move, then a direction change would be to up, then another change back to right, and so on.

Wait, the number of runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. So, for example, a path like R R U U R R U U R R U U R R U U would have four direction changes because it switches direction four times, right? Wait, no, that's more than four. Wait, let me count. Starting with R, then U is one change, then R is another, then U is three, then R is four, then U is five. Wait, that's more than four. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. Because each time you start a new run, that's a direction change. So if you have k runs, you have k-1 direction changes. So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, then the number of runs is five. Because, for example, if you have runs R, U, R
