Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me go through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, that means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. 

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the problem. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is one side, BC is another, and so on. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points D and C are corners of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are corners of rectangle EFGH. So, the line DF (which includes points D, E, C, F) must be a straight line. That might mean that the rectangles are placed adjacent to each other along this line.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Since A and D are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD, and H and G are corners of EFGH, this suggests that the two rectangles are connected in such a way that these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, AB is the length, BC is the width. Then, rectangle EFGH has EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is the length, FG is the width.

Points D, E, C, F are on a straight line. So, point D is one corner of ABCD, point E is adjacent to D in EFGH, then point C is opposite to D in ABCD, and point F is adjacent to E in EFGH. So, the line goes D-E-C-F.

Since A, D, H, G are concyclic, they form a cyclic quadrilateral. So, maybe the two rectangles are arranged such that their sides overlap on the line DF, and the points A, D, H, G lie on the same circle.

I think I need to assign coordinate systems to these points to model the problem mathematically.

Let me assume that the line DF is the x-axis. Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0). Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and let's say DF is along the x-axis.

So, rectangle ABCD has points A, B, C, D. Since ABCD is a rectangle, sides AB and CD are equal and parallel, and sides BC and AD are equal and parallel.

Given that AB = 107 and BC = 16, so if D is at (0, 0), then C is at (x, 0), but wait, since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16. So, the sides are AB = 107, BC = 16, CD = 107, DA = 16.

But wait, ABCD being a rectangle, if D is at (0, 0), then C would be at (107, 0), but that would make BC = 16, so from C, moving up 16 units to point B, which would be at (107, 16). Then, point A would be at (0, 16). Wait, but that would not align with the line DF, which is the x-axis.

Wait, no, because D is at (0,0), and C is at (107,0), but in the line DF, which includes D, E, C, F. So, if D is (0,0), and C is (107, 0), then E and F are somewhere on the x-axis between D and C or beyond.

Wait, but EFGH is another rectangle. So, if E is between D and C, then F must be beyond C, or perhaps E is beyond D and F is between D and C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis, and EFGH is a rectangle, so points E and F are adjacent corners.

Assuming EFGH is a rectangle, so EF is one side, FG is another. Since EF = 184 and FG =17, so the rectangle EFGH has length 184 and width 17.

So, point E is connected to F, which is 184 units apart, and then F to G is 17 units upwards (assuming the rectangle is above the x-axis), but wait, that depends on how the rectangle is placed.

Alternatively, maybe EF is along the x-axis, but since D, E, C, F are on the x-axis, EFGH must be a rectangle with sides EF and FG perpendicular to the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps E is to the right of D on the x-axis, and F is to the right of E. Then, G would be above
