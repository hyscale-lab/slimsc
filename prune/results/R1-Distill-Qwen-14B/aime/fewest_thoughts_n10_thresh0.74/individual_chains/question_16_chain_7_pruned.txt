Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, alright, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, then I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So the primes start at 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. My job is to check these primes in order and see if any of them satisfy the condition that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

So, let me start by checking the smallest primes one by one.

First prime is 2. Let's see if 2²=4 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let's test n=1: 1⁴ +1 = 2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, not divisible by 4. n=3: 81+1=82. 82 divided by 4 is 20.5, which is not an integer. Hmm, so 4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n? Wait, let me think. Is there any n where n⁴ is odd? Because n⁴ is even if n is even, and odd if n is odd. So n⁴ +1 would be even if n is odd (since odd +1 is even) and odd if n is even (even +1 is odd). Therefore, n⁴ +1 is always even, but for it to be divisible by 4, n⁴ +1 must be 0 mod 4.

Let me compute n⁴ mod 4 for n odd and even. If n is even, say n=2k, then n⁴ = (2k)^4 = 16k^4, which is 0 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 would be 1 mod 4. If n is odd, say n=2k+1, then (2k+1)^4. Let's compute that modulo 4.

Expanding (2k+1)^4:
= 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k +1.
Modulo 4, all terms except the last one are 0 because they have factors of 4. So modulo 4, it's just 1. So n⁴ is 1 mod 4 whether n is even or odd? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, n even: n=2k, n^4 = 16k^4, which is 0 mod 4. So n^4 +1 would be 1 mod 4. If n is odd, n=2k+1, then n^4 is 1 mod 4, so n^4 +1 is 2 mod 4. So 2 mod 4 is not 0 mod 4, so n^4 +1 can never be 0 mod 4. Therefore, 4 can't divide n^4 +1 for any n. So p=2 is out.

Okay, moving on to the next prime, which is 3. Let's check if 3²=9 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So we need to see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9.

Let me compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 0 to 8, since modulo 9 cycles every 9 numbers.

n=0: 0⁴=0 → 0 mod9
n=1:1⁴=1 →1
n=2:16 mod9=7
n=3:81 mod9=0
n=4:256 mod9. Let's compute 256 /9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4 →4 mod9
n=5:625 mod9. 9*69=621, 625-621=4 →4 mod9
Wait, that's the same as n=4? Hmm, maybe I should compute differently.

Wait, 4²=16≡7 mod9.
