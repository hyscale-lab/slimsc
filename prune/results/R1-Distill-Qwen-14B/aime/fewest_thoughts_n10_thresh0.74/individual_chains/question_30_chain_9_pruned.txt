Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, since ω is a 13th root of unity, I know that ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the product is over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That's a lot of terms, 13 terms in total. Let's write out the product as P = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

I wonder if there's a way to simplify each term before multiplying them all together. Let me look at the term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of ω^k in a way that leverages the properties of roots of unity.

Let me denote z = ω^k. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, z will also be a 13th root of unity, except when k=0, z=1. Wait, for k=0, ω^0 = 1, so plugging that in, the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term when k=0 is 1.

So, except for k=0, all other terms have z being a primitive 13th root of unity or a root of unity of a lower order? Wait, no, because 13 is prime, so all ω^k for k=1 to 12 are primitive 13th roots. Okay, so except for k=0, each term is a quadratic in a primitive 13th root of unity.

So, maybe I can write the term as 2 - 2z + z², where z = ω^k. Let me see if that factors or can be rewritten.

Let me rearrange the terms: 2 - 2z + z² = z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, can I factor this quadratic? Let's look for roots:

The quadratic equation z² - 2z + 2 = 0. The discriminant is ( -2 )² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are z = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i. So the roots are complex numbers, 1 + i and 1 - i.

So, the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). Therefore, each term in the product, except when k=0, is (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), where z = ω^k.

So, the product P becomes, for k=0, 1, ..., 12:

P = [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i))].

But since for k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term is (1 - (1 + i))(1 - (1 - i)) = (-i)(i) = (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, we can factor the entire product as:

P = [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

But wait, when k=0, both products have a factor of (1 - (1 + i)) and (1 - (1 - i)), which are (-i) and (i), respectively. So, the product for each bracket will include these factors, but since we multiply all 13 terms, each bracket includes (ω^k - a) for k=0 to 12, which is the same as evaluating the polynomial Φ₁₃(x) at x = a
