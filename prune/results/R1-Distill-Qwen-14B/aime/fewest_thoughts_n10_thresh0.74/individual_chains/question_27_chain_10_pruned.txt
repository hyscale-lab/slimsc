Okay, so I have this math problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to picture it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. The problem says the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere or outside. When it's inside, they're tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent internally. That probably means the sphere is larger, and the torus is just touching it from the inside. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus encloses the sphere, touching it externally.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, the distance between their centers must satisfy certain conditions. Let me think about the geometry here.

First, let's model the torus. A torus can be described using two radii: R is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis (so 6 in this case), and r is the radius of the generating circle (3 here). So, the equation of the torus in 3D coordinates is a bit complex, but maybe I can consider it in a cross-sectional view.

When the torus is tangent to the sphere, the point of tangency would lie along the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the generating circle of the torus. Wait, actually, the sphere is a single center, while the torus is more complicated. Hmm, maybe I need to model the centers differently.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the torus as a surface of revolution. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is enclosing it. The point of tangency would be where the torus's surface just touches the sphere's surface. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, touching it at a circle.

Let me consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere first. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The torus's major radius is 6, and minor radius 3. So, the farthest point on the torus from the center of the sphere would be when the generating circle is at the point farthest from the sphere's center. Wait, but where is the center of the torus relative to the sphere's center?

Wait, hold on. The torus is generated by rotating a circle around an axis. So, the center of that generating circle must be at a distance of 6 from the axis. Let me set up a coordinate system where the axis of the torus is along the x-axis. Then, the generating circle is in the y-z plane, centered at (6, 0, 0), with radius 3.

So, the sphere is also centered somewhere. Wait, noâ€”if the torus is resting on the inside or outside of the sphere, I think the sphere's center must coincide with the torus's center. Or is it? Hmm, maybe not necessarily. Wait, no, the sphere is just another object; maybe the torus is placed such that its center is aligned with the sphere's center.

Wait, perhaps to make things easier, let's assume that the center of the sphere is at the origin, and the
