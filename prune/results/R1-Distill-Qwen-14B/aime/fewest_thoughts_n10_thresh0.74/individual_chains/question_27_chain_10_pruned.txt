Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by revolving a circle around an axis. The problem says the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is in the plane of the circle, 6 units away from the center. So, if I imagine the circle lying in a plane, and the axis is a line in that same plane but 6 units away from where the circle is centered.

So, the torus T is this donut shape. Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem talks about two scenarios: when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm. I remember that for a torus, the surface can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, the minor radius is 3, and the major radius R is 6, because the axis is 6 units away from the center of the generating circle.

Wait, but in the problem statement, when T is resting inside S, it's tangent along a circle, and similarly when outside. So, I think I need to find the radii of these tangent circles, r_i and r_o.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. When the torus is inside the sphere, how do they touch? The sphere has a radius of 11, so the center of the sphere must be somewhere, and the torus is inside it. The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. So, the point of tangency is a circle, and that circle has some radius r_i.

Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, they are tangent along another circle with radius r_o.

I think I need to model this mathematically. Let me consider the torus and the sphere in a coordinate system where their centers align along the same axis.

Let's take the sphere S centered at the origin (0,0,0) with radius 11. Then, the torus T can be placed such that its axis of revolution is along, say, the z-axis. Wait, but the problem says the axis is in the plane of the generating circle. Hmm, maybe I should think in 2D first.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider cross-sectional views. Since both the sphere and the torus are rotationally symmetric, we can look at them in a plane that includes the axis of the torus and the center of the sphere.

Let me think in 2D. The sphere S has radius 11, so in cross-section, it's a circle with radius 11. The torus T can be represented in cross-section as two circles: one on the inside (from the major radius) and one on the outside (the major radius plus minor radius). Wait, noâ€”actually, in cross-section, a torus is a circle with radius equal to the minor radius, centered at a distance equal to the
