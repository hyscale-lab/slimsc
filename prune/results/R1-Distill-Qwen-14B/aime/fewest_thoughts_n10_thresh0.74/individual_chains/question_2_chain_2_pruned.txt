Okay, so I have this problem with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a family of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. The task is to find a point C on AB, which isn't A or B, such that C isn't on any other segment from this family except AB. Then, compute OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So, AB is a line segment connecting (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). That should make a straight line, and the equation of AB can be found.

First, let me find the equation of line AB. The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the slope is -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form, let's write the equation.

Using point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, all in the first quadrant. So each PQ is a line segment from some point (p, 0) on the x-axis to (0, q) on the y-axis, with the distance between P and Q being 1.

So the distance formula between P(p,0) and Q(0,q) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant, p and q are positive real numbers. So for each such segment PQ, we can describe it by the point (p,0) and (0,q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1.

But wait, the problem mentions the family F is all such segments PQ. So each PQ is a line segment, not just the two endpoints. So for each p and q satisfying p^2 + q^2 = 1, we have a segment PQ.

Now, we're to find a point C on AB, not equal to A or B, such that C is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, except for AB, there's no other segment PQ in F that passes through C.

So, we need to find C on AB such that it's only on AB and no other PQ in F.

Perhaps point C is the intersection point of AB with another PQ, but since it's unique, maybe it's a point where AB is tangent to some curve related to the family F.

Wait, but the family F consists of all line segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, and PQ of unit length. So each such PQ is a straight line, and the set of all such lines can be thought of as a family of lines with intercepts p and q such that p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So each PQ line can be written in intercept form as x/p + y/q = 1, where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Therefore, the family F can be represented by lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, to find a point C on AB that isn't on any other line from F except AB itself.

So, the point C is on AB and also on another line PQ from F, and we need to find such a point C that is only on AB and no other PQ.

Wait, no, the problem states that C is on AB, and it does not belong to any other segment from F except AB
