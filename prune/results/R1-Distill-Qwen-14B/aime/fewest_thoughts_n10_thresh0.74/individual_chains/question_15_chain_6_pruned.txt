Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I know that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. So the total number of steps is 16, which makes sense because the problem says the path length is 16. 

Normally, without any restrictions on direction changes, the number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, I have a constraint: the path must change direction exactly four times. So, I need to figure out how this affects the number of paths.

Wait, changing direction exactly four times... Let me think about what that implies. Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or up to right. So, in a path with four direction changes, how does that structure look?

Let's consider that a path is a sequence of horizontal and vertical moves. Each time the direction changes, it's like going from moving right (R) to up (U) or vice versa. So, if there are four direction changes, how many segments of consecutive R's or U's do we have?

Hmm, each direction change adds a new segment. So, starting with either R or U, each subsequent direction change adds another segment. So, for four direction changes, how many segments do we have? Let me see:

- Starting direction: 1 segment.
- Each direction change adds 1 segment. So, four direction changes would mean 1 + 4 = 5 segments.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me count again. Suppose the first move is R, then each direction change (U, R, U, R) would add four more segments. So total segments would be 5. Similarly, if starting with U, same logic. So total segments are 5 in the path.

Each segment is a consecutive run of either R's or U's. So, each segment must have at least one step. So, the path is divided into five segments, alternating between R and U.

Now, since the grid is 8x8, the total number of R's is 8 and the total number of U's is 8. So, the sum of the lengths of all R segments must be 8, and the same for U segments.

Since there are five segments, and they alternate between R and U, the number of R segments and U segments depends on whether the path starts with R or U.

Case 1: The path starts with R. Then, the segments go R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments.

Case 2: The path starts with U. Then, the segments go U, R, U, R, U. So, three U segments and two R segments.

So, for each case, we have to compute the number of ways to distribute the steps and then multiply by the number of starting directions.

Wait, but the starting direction can be either R or U, but in the problem statement, are both considered? Because the grid is symmetric, so I think both cases will contribute equally. So maybe I can compute one case and double it. Let me verify.

But wait, in each case, the number of direction changes is four, but the starting direction affects the number of R and U segments.

Wait, in case 1, starting with R, we have three R segments and two U segments. Since the total R steps are 8, we need to distribute 8 R's into 3 segments, each at least 1. Similarly, distribute 8 U's into 2 segments, each at least 1.

Similarly, in case 2, starting with U, we have three U segments
