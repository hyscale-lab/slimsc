Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to visualize it first. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis towards (1,0), and B is a bit higher up on the y-axis. I think AB connects these two points, making a line segment from A to B. 

Then, there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. Point P is on the x-axis, and point Q is on the y-axis. So, for each segment in F, one end is somewhere on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis, and the distance between them is exactly 1. 

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. My goal is to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Hmm, so I need to find point C on AB such that no other segment from F passes through it. Then, compute OC².

First, let me figure out the equation of line AB. Points A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB would be (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). 

So, the equation of line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. To find c, plug in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c → c = sqrt(3)/2. So, equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, I can write it as y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). That might be useful.

So, any point C on AB can be parametrized as moving from A to B. Let me parameterize it. Let's say t is a parameter from 0 to 1, where t=0 is A and t=1 is B.

So, coordinates of C would be (1/2 - (1/2)t, 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t). Wait, let me check that.

Wait, point A is (1/2, 0). The vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, parametrizing as C(t) = A + t*(B - A) = (1/2, 0) + t*(-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). 

So, C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, 0 + t*sqrt(3)/2). So, x-coordinate is (1 - t)/2, y-coordinate is (sqrt(3) t)/2. That's correct.

So, point C is ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) where t is between 0 and 1.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, PQ = 1, lying in the first quadrant. So, each such segment connects (p, 0) to (0, q) with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1.

But because they are in the first quadrant, p and q are positive, so p = sqrt(1 - q²) or q = sqrt(1 - p²). 

Alternatively, since the length is 1, we can have p = cosθ, q = sinθ for some θ between 0 and π/2. Because in that case, sqrt( cos²θ + sin²θ ) = 1.

So, any segment PQ in F can be represented as from (cosθ, 0) to (0, sinθ) for θ in [0, π/2]. 

So, the equation of such a segment PQ: it goes from (cosθ, 0) to (0, sinθ). Let me find the equation of PQ.

The slope of PQ is (sinθ - 0)/(0 - cosθ) = -tanθ. So, the equation is y = -tan
