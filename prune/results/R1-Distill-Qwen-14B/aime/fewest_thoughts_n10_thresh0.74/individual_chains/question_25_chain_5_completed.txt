Okay, so I have this problem about Aimeville residents and the things they own. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The problem gives me various numbers about how many residents own different items, and it also mentions some overlaps. I need to find how many own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts.

Hmm, so let me jot down the numbers first. There are 900 residents in total. 

- Number of residents owning a diamond ring (let's denote this as D) is 195.
- Golf clubs (G) is 367.
- Garden spade (S) is 562.
- And everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C). Wait, that's interesting because it's mentioned that each of the 900 owns a candy heart. So, the number of people owning C is 900.

Wait, so the problem is about four sets: D, G, S, and C. But C is universal because everyone owns it. So, everyone in Aimeville has a candy heart. That might simplify things because the overlap for C is 100%. So, when considering intersections, C is always included. 

But the problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Wait, but it doesn't mention exactly four. Oh, but the question is about those who own all four, which would be exactly four. Wait, but since candy hearts are included in everyone, owning all four would mean owning D, G, S, and C. But since C is owned by everyone, maybe we can ignore C when considering the exact overlaps, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. But since C is a universal set, maybe that's simpler. Let me recall the formula for four sets. The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is a bit complicated, but perhaps since C is everyone, it's easier.

Wait, let me try to structure this. Let me denote the four items as D, G, S, and C. Since C is owned by everyone, the total number of people is 900, so n(C) = 900. 

But the problem is asking for the number of people who own all four, which is n(D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C). But since C is universal, this is the same as n(D ∩ G ∩ S). So, if I can find n(D ∩ G ∩ S), that's the number of people who own all four items because they must also own C.

Wait, but the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three items. So perhaps I can model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets (D, G, S) and then relate it to the given numbers. Because C is universal, perhaps it's not necessary to include it in the intersections beyond the others.

Wait, let me think. So, the total number of people is 900, and each person owns at least one of D, G, S, or C. But since everyone owns C, maybe the other three (D, G, S) are optional. So, perhaps the problem is about how the 900 residents distribute among owning D, G, S, and C. But wait, C is a must, so the residents can have any combination of D, G, S, with C always included.

Wait, but let me get back to the problem. It says there are 437 who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. The problem is about the number of people owning all four, which would be exactly four, since C is always owned. Hmm, but wait, if someone owns all four, that's the same as owning D, G, S, and C. Since C is already included, perhaps the number of people owning exactly three items would include those who own D, G, S but not C? But no, because C is owned by everyone, so if someone owns three items, it must include C, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because C is owned by everyone, so if someone has exactly two items, they must have C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four would be C plus all three others.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the counts of people owning exactly two, three, or four items would all include C. So, let's model it this way:

Let me define:

- a = number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S. So, they have C plus one other item. So, exactly two items in total would be C and one more. Wait, no, exactly two items would be C plus one other, so they own exactly two things: C and one among D, G, S.

Similarly, exactly three items would be C plus two among D, G, S.

And exactly four items would be C plus all three: D, G, S.

Wait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two things, 234 own exactly three, and the rest would own exactly four.

But wait, the problem doesn't directly state that. It says 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three. It asks for exactly four, which would be the remaining, but perhaps I can compute that.

Wait, no, because the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts," so everyone has C. So, for each person, the number of items owned is 1 (only C) plus how many of D, G, S they have. But the problem says that 437 own exactly two things, which would mean they have C plus one more. Similarly, 234 own exactly three, which is C plus two more. And the rest would have all four, which is C plus all three.

Wait, so the number of people owning exactly four things (all four) is equal to the number of people owning all three D, G, S. Because C is already included. So, if someone owns all four, they must have D, G, S, and C. But the problem is asking for the number of people who own all four, which is the same as the number of people owning D, G, S, and C, which is the same as just D ∩ G ∩ S, since C is universal.

So, let me denote:

Let x be the number of people who own all four items (D, G, S, C). So, x is also the number of people who own D, G, S, because C is always there.

We are to find x.

Now, let me think about the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets (since C is universal, we can model the overlaps among D, G, S and then include C automatically). Let me denote:

n(D) = 195

n(G) = 367

n(S) = 562

We need to find the number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S, and exactly three of D, G, S.

Wait, but the problem says that 437 people own exactly two items. But wait, since everyone has C, the exactly two items would be C plus one of D, G, S. So, the 437 people own exactly two items in total: C plus one more. Similarly, 234 own exactly three items: C plus two more, and x own exactly four items: C plus all three.

So, the total number of people is 900. So, the sum of people owning exactly one, two, three, and four items should be 900. But wait, but the problem doesn't mention those who own exactly one item. Wait, but in this context, since everyone owns C, but they could own only C. So, perhaps some people own only C. Let me check that.

Wait, if some people own only C, then they would be counted as owning exactly one item. But the problem says that 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and x own exactly four. So, the number of people owning exactly one item is 900 - (437 + 234 + x). Let me compute that: 900 - 437 is 463, minus 234 is 229, so 229 - x. Wait, but it can't be negative, so x must be less than 229. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me proceed.

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the four items, but since C is owned by everyone, perhaps the 'exactly two' refers to exactly two of D, G, S, in addition to C. So, perhaps the 437 people own exactly two of D, G, S, and C, making it three items in total. Similarly, the 234 own exactly three of D, G, S, plus C, making it four items. So, that's how I should interpret the problem.

Wait, that might make more sense. Because if someone owns exactly two things, and they have C, then they must have one more item. So, for example, they have C and D, but not G and S. Similarly for others.

So, perhaps the problem defines 'exactly two' as exactly two items including C. So, 437 own exactly two items, meaning they have C plus one of D, G, S. Similarly, 234 own exactly three items, meaning they have C plus two of D, G, S. And x own all four, meaning they have C plus all three. So, now, the number of people owning exactly two, three, or four items is 437 + 234 + x. The remaining people, 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x, would own exactly one item, which is only C.

But wait, let me think again. If someone owns exactly one item, it's just C. So, that's possible. So, the total number of people is the sum of those owning exactly one, two, three, and four items. So, 900 = (number with exactly one) + 437 + 234 + x.

So, number with exactly one is 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.

Now, let's model the inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S, considering that C is universal.

Wait, but since C is universal, the total number of people owning D is 195, which includes all the people who own D plus C and possibly other items. Similarly for G and S.

So, perhaps I can write the inclusion-exclusion formula for D, G, S, and then relate it to the given numbers.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets (D, G, S) is:

n(D ∪ G ∪ S) = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) - n(D∩G) - n(D∩S) - n(G∩S) + n(D∩G∩S).

But since everyone owns C, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to n(D ∪ G ∪ S). But wait, no, because some people might not own any of D, G, S. Those people would only own C. So, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is 900 minus the number of people who own only C. So, n(D ∪ G ∪ S) = 900 - (number of people owning only C) = 900 - (229 - x) = 671 + x.

Wait, because earlier we found that number with exactly one is (229 - x), which are the people owning only C. So, n(D ∪ G ∪ S) = 900 - (229 - x) = 671 + x.

But let's also expand the inclusion-exclusion formula:

n(D ∪ G ∪ S) = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) - n(D∩G) - n(D∩S) - n(G∩S) + n(D∩G∩S).

We know n(D) = 195, n(G) = 367, n(S) = 562.

So, plugging in:

671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] + n(D∩G∩S).

Wait, but we can relate the pairwise intersections and the triple intersection to the counts of exactly two and exactly three.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me denote the following:

Let a = number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S (so, they have C plus one, but wait no, wait, in this case, since we're considering exactly two of D, G, S, plus C. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, in this problem, when someone owns exactly two items, they have C plus one of D, G, S. So, the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which includes all the people who have C and one other. Similarly, the 234 with exactly three items have C plus two others. And x have C plus all three.

So, the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, C would be 437. But wait, no. Wait, perhaps I need to model this correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the context of D, G, S, the number of people owning exactly two among D, G, S is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. Wait, no, the formula for exactly two is:

n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S) - 3n(D∩G∩S).

No, actually, the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. Because each pairwise intersection includes those who have exactly two and those who have all three.

So, for example, n(D∩G) includes people who have both D and G, which could be those who have only D and G, plus those who have D, G, and S. So, to get exactly D and G, we subtract those who have all three.

So, the number of people owning exactly D and G is n(D∩G) - n(D∩G∩S). Similarly for the other pairs. So, the total number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is:

[n(D∩G) - x] + [n(D∩S) - x] + [n(G∩S) - x] = (n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)) - 3x.

And this is equal to 437, according to the problem.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of D, G, S is x, which is exactly the same as n(D∩G∩S), because those who own all three must also have C, so x = n(D∩G∩S).

So now, I can write the equation as:

(n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)) - 3x = 437.

That's equation one.

Now, for the inclusion-exclusion principle applied to D, G, S, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is:

n(D ∪ G ∪ S) = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) - n(D∩G) - n(D∩S) - n(G∩S) + n(D∩G∩S).

Which, as I found earlier, is 671 + x.

So, substituting the known values:

671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] + x.

Wait, but let me compute the sum of n(D) + n(G) + n(S):

195 + 367 = 562, plus 562 is 1124.

So, 671 + x = 1124 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] + x.

Wait, but the x terms cancel out on both sides.

So, 671 = 1124 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)].

Then, [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] = 1124 - 671 = 453.

So, the sum of the pairwise intersections is 453.

Now, going back to equation one:

(n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)) - 3x = 437.

We know that sum is 453, so:

453 - 3x = 437.

So, subtracting 437 from both sides:

16 = 3x.

So, x = 16/3 ≈ 5.333...

Wait, but that can't be right because the number of people should be an integer. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Hmm, let me check my steps again.

First, total residents: 900.

Number with exactly two items: 437. These are people who own C and exactly one of D, G, S.

Number with exactly three items: 234. These are people who own C and exactly two of D, G, S.

Number with exactly four items: x. These own C and all three of D, G, S.

So, total people:

- Only C: 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 229 - x.

Now, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is n(D∪G∪S) = 900 - (number of people owning only C) = 900 - (229 - x) = 671 + x.

Then, using inclusion-exclusion:

n(D∪G∪S) = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) - n(D∩G) - n(D∩S) - n(G∩S) + n(D∩G∩S).

Substituting:

671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] + x.

Wait, 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. So,

671 + x = 1124 - [pairwise sums] + x.

Subtracting x from both sides,

671 = 1124 - [pairwise sums].

So, [pairwise sums] = 1124 - 671 = 453. That part seems correct.

Now, for exactly two owners among D, G, S: the number is 437. Which, as per inclusion-exclusion, is:

(n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)) - 3x = 437.

So, 453 - 3x = 437.

So, 453 - 437 = 16 = 3x.

So, x = 16/3 ≈ 5.333.

But that's not an integer, which is impossible because the number of people must be an integer. So, where did I go wrong?

Hmm. Let me check my assumptions again.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the inclusion-exclusion for exactly two. Let me think again.

The formula for exactly two is:

Number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S = [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] - 3 * n(D∩G∩S).

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps not. Wait, for each pairwise intersection, like D and G, the number of people owning exactly D and G is n(D∩G) - n(D∩G∩S). Because n(D∩G) includes those who own D, G, and S as well.

So, the number of people owning exactly D and G is n(D∩G) - x.

Similarly, exactly D and S is n(D∩S) - x.

Exactly G and S is n(G∩S) - x.

So, the total number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is (n(D∩G) - x) + (n(D∩S) - x) + (n(G∩S) - x) = [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] - 3x.

Which is equal to 437.

So, 453 - 3x = 437 → 3x = 16 → x = 16/3 ≈ 5.333.

Hmm, which is not an integer. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, maybe the interpretation of exactly two and exactly three is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that 437 own exactly two of these things. Wait, perhaps these two things can include the candy hearts. So, someone could own exactly two things, one of which is C, and the other is either D, G, or S.

Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things would have C plus two of D, G, S.

And someone who owns exactly four things would have C plus all three of D, G, S.

So, in that case, the number of people owning exactly two things would be the sum over all pairs (including C) of the intersections minus three times the triple intersection.

Wait, so the number of people owning exactly two items would be the sum of the pairwise intersections of (C with D), (C with G), (C with S), plus the pairwise intersections among D, G, S, but excluding those who have all three.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should model it using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since C is universal, perhaps it's easier.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote the four sets as D, G, S, C, where C is the universal set. So, the formula for the union of four sets is:

n(D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C) = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) + n(C) - n(D∩G) - n(D∩S) - n(D∩C) - n(G∩S) - n(G∩C) - n(S∩C) + n(D∩G∩S) + n(D∩G∩C) + n(D∩S∩C) + n(G∩S∩C) - n(D∩G∩S∩C).

But since C is universal, n(C) = 900, and any intersection involving C is just the other set. For example, n(D∩C) = n(D), because everyone who owns D also owns C. Similarly, n(D∩G∩C) = n(D∩G), and so on.

So, substituting:

n(D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C) = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) + 900 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S) + n(D) + n(G) + n(S)] + [n(D∩G∩S) + n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] - n(D∩G∩S).

Wait, this seems complicated, but let me try to simplify.

But since C is universal, the union D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C is just C, which is 900. So,

900 = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) + 900 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S) + n(D) + n(G) + n(S)] + [n(D∩G∩S) + n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] - n(D∩G∩S).

Wait, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can cancel some terms.

Wait, let's compute each part:

- The left side is 900.

- The right side starts with n(D) + n(G) + n(S) + 900.

Minus [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S) + n(D) + n(G) + n(S)].

Plus [n(D∩G∩S) + n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)].

Minus n(D∩G∩S).

So, let's write it out step by step.

First, expand the terms:

= n(D) + n(G) + n(S) + 900

- n(D∩G) - n(D∩S) - n(G∩S) - n(D) - n(G) - n(S)

+ n(D∩G∩S) + n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)

- n(D∩G∩S)

Now, let's cancel like terms.

n(D) cancels with -n(D).

n(G) cancels with -n(G).

n(S) cancels with -n(S).

Similarly, -n(D∩G) cancels with +n(D∩G).

-n(D∩S) cancels with +n(D∩S).

-n(G∩S) cancels with +n(G∩S).

Then, n(D∩G∩S) and -n(D∩G∩S) cancel each other.

So, what's left is:

900 = 900.

Wait, that's an identity, which doesn't give any new information. So, that approach might not help.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me think about the number of people owning exactly k items, for k=1,2,3,4.

Since C is universal, the number of people owning exactly k items is the number of people owning exactly (k-1) of D, G, S, plus C.

So, the number of people owning exactly 1 item is the number of people owning exactly 0 of D, G, S, plus C. But wait, no, because exactly 1 item would be only C, since C is always present. So, exactly 1 item is only C, which is n(C only) = 229 - x, as I found earlier.

Similarly, exactly 2 items would be C plus exactly 1 of D, G, S. So, the number is equal to the sum of the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S. Let me denote this as a.

Similarly, exactly 3 items would be C plus exactly two of D, G, S. Let's denote this as b.

And exactly 4 items would be C plus all three, which is x.

So, the total number of people is:

(229 - x) [exactly 1] + a [exactly 2] + b [exactly 3] + x [exactly 4] = 900.

But according to the problem, a = 437, and b = 234. So,

229 - x + 437 + 234 + x = 900.

Wait, 229 - x + 437 + 234 + x = 229 + 437 + 234 = 900.

But that's just 900 = 900, which doesn't help me find x. So, that approach isn't helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I need to model the problem using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, considering that C is universal.

Wait, let me think again. The total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is 900 minus the number of people owning only C. Which is 900 - (229 - x) = 671 + x.

So, from inclusion-exclusion:

671 + x = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) - n(D∩G) - n(D∩S) - n(G∩S) + n(D∩G∩S).

Which is 195 + 367 + 562 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] + x.

So, 671 + x = 1124 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] + x.

Subtracting x from both sides, 671 = 1124 - [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)].

Which gives [n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] = 1124 - 671 = 453.

Now, the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is 437, which is equal to:

[n(D∩G) + n(D∩S) + n(G∩S)] - 3x = 437.

So, 453 - 3x = 437 → 3x = 16 → x = 16/3 ≈ 5.333.

Wait, but that's impossible because x must be an integer. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.

"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts."

So, every resident has C. So, C is a given. So, when the problem says someone owns exactly two of these things, it's talking about exactly two, including C.

So, for example, someone who owns exactly two items would have C and one of D, G, S. Similarly, exactly three items would have C plus two of D, G, S, and exactly four would have all four.

Wait, but then the number of people owning exactly two items is 437. So, that would be the sum of the people owning C and D only, C and G only, and C and S only.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three items is 234, which is the sum of those owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S.

And the number of people owning all four is x, which is the same as the number of people owning D, G, S, and C, which is n(D∩G∩S).

So, perhaps I should model the problem using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since C is universal, perhaps it's easier to model without considering C.

Wait, but if C is universal, then the number of people owning D is the same as the number of people owning D and C. Similarly, the number owning D and G is the same as D, G, and C, and so on. So, perhaps I can think of it as:

The number of people owning exactly two items (including C) is 437. So, this would be the sum of the people owning C and D only, C and G only, C and S only.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three items (including C) is 234, which includes those owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S.

And the number of people owning all four is x, which is the same as those owning C, D, G, S.

So, perhaps I can model the problem as:

n(C only) = 900 - (number of people owning at least one of D, G, S) = 900 - (n(D ∪ G ∪ S)).

Wait, but n(D ∪ G ∪ S) is the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, which is 671 + x as I found earlier.

So, n(C only) = 900 - (671 + x) = 229 - x.

Now, the number of people owning exactly two items (including C) is 437. So, that's the sum of:

n(C∩D only) + n(C∩G only) + n(C∩S only) = 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three items (including C) is 234. So, that's the sum of:

n(C∩D∩G only) + n(C∩D∩S only) + n(C∩G∩S only) = 234.

And the number of people owning exactly four items is x, which is n(C∩D∩G∩S).

Now, let me express these in terms of the intersections.

n(C∩D only) = n(C∩D) - n(C∩D∩G) - n(C∩D∩S) - n(C∩D∩G∩S).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because n(C∩D) includes those who have C, D, and possibly G or S. So, to get exactly C and D, we need to subtract those who have C, D, and another item.

So, n(C∩D only) = n(C∩D) - [n(C∩D∩G) + n(C∩D∩S) - n(C∩D∩G∩S)].

Wait, that might be getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S and relate it to the given numbers.

Let me define:

a = n(C∩D only) = people who own C and D, but not G or S.

b = n(C∩G only) = people who own C and G, but not D or S.

c = n(C∩S only) = people who own C and S, but not D or G.

d = n(C∩D∩G only) = people who own C, D, and G, but not S.

e = n(C∩D∩S only) = people who own C, D, and S, but not G.

f = n(C∩G∩S only) = people who own C, G, and S, but not D.

g = n(C∩D∩G∩S) = people who own all four, which is x.

So, the number of people owning exactly two items (including C) is a + b + c = 437.

The number of people owning exactly three items (including C) is d + e + f = 234.

The number of people owning exactly four items is g = x.

Now, the total number of people owning D is:

n(D) = a + d + e + g = 195.

Similarly,

n(G) = b + d + f + g = 367.

n(S) = c + e + f + g = 562.

Now, I can write these as equations:

1. a + d + e + g = 195

2. b + d + f + g = 367

3. c + e + f + g = 562

Also, I know that:

a + b + c = 437

d + e + f = 234

g = x

Now, I have five equations:

Equation 1: a + d + e + g = 195

Equation 2: b + d + f + g = 367

Equation 3: c + e + f + g = 562

Equation 4: a + b + c = 437

Equation 5: d + e + f = 234

Equation 6: g = x

So, I can try to solve these equations step by step.

Let me try to express a, b, c in terms of d, e, f, g.

From Equation 4: a = 437 - b - c.

Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a, b, c as:

a = 437 - b - c.

But perhaps a better approach is to sum Equations 1, 2, and 3.

Equation 1 + Equation 2 + Equation 3:

(a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) = 195 + 367 + 562.

Simplify:

a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 1124.

Now, from Equation 4: a + b + c = 437. So, substitute that in:

437 + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 1124.

Then,

2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 1124 - 437 = 687.

Divide both sides by 2:

d + e + f + 1.5g = 343.5.

But from Equation 5: d + e + f = 234.

So, substituting:

234 + 1.5g = 343.5.

Subtract 234:

1.5g = 343.5 - 234 = 109.5.

So, g = 109.5 / 1.5 = 73.

So, x = g = 73.

Wait, that's an integer, so that's possible.

But let me check if this makes sense.

So, x = 73.

Now, let's find d + e + f = 234 from Equation 5.

So, from Equation 1: a + d + e + g = 195 → a = 195 - d - e - g = 195 - d - e - 73 = 122 - d - e.

Similarly, from Equation 2: b + d + f + g = 367 → b = 367 - d - f -73 = 294 - d - f.

From Equation 3: c + e + f + g = 562 → c = 562 - e - f -73 = 489 - e - f.

Now, from Equation 4: a + b + c = 437.

Substituting the expressions for a, b, c:

(122 - d - e) + (294 - d - f) + (489 - e - f) = 437.

Simplify:

122 + 294 + 489 - d - e - d - f - e - f = 437.

Adding the numbers: 122 + 294 = 416; 416 + 489 = 905.

So,

905 - 2d - 2e - 2f = 437.

But from Equation 5, d + e + f = 234. So, 2d + 2e + 2f = 468.

So,

905 - 468 = 437 → 437 = 437.

Which holds true, so it's consistent.

So, the value of x is 73.

Wait, but earlier when I tried the other approach, I got x = 5.333, which was incorrect. So, perhaps this approach is correct.

So, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the overlaps among the sets of residents owning diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C), where C is universal (everyone owns it).

### Key Steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - \( n(D) = 195 \), \( n(G) = 367 \), \( n(S) = 562 \), \( n(C) = 900 \).
   - Let \( x \) be the number of residents who own all four items (D, G, S, C).

2. **Total Residents:**
   - The total number of residents is 900.

3. **People Owning Exactly Two Items:**
   - 437 residents own exactly two items, which includes C and one of D, G, or S.

4. **People Owning Exactly Three Items:**
   - 234 residents own exactly three items, which includes C and two of D, G, or S.

5. **People Owning Exactly Four Items:**
   - \( x \) residents own all four items (C, D, G, S).

6. **People Owning Only C:**
   - The number of people owning only C is \( 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 229 - x \).

7. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle for D, G, S:**
   - The total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is \( 900 - (229 - x) = 671 + x \).
   - Using inclusion-exclusion:
     \[
     671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - [\text{pairwise intersections}] + x
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     671 = 1124 - [\text{pairwise intersections}]
     \]
     So, the sum of pairwise intersections is 453.

8. **Exactly Two Items Among D, G, S:**
   - The number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is given by:
     \[
     [\text{pairwise intersections}] - 3x = 437
     \]
     Substituting the sum of pairwise intersections:
     \[
     453 - 3x = 437 \implies 3x = 16 \implies x = \frac{16}{3}
     \]
     However, this yields a non-integer, indicating an error in interpretation.

9. **Revisiting the Approach:**
   - Correctly interpreting the problem, we model the overlaps considering C as universal and solve the system of equations derived from the given numbers. This leads to \( x = 73 \).

### Final Answer:
The number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
