Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. So, Alice picks some set A, and Bob creates a list of all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of each B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I need to figure out what A is and then sum its elements.

Let me think about how Bob constructs his list. For each set B, the maximum element has to be in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can form sets B where a is the maximum. How many such sets can be formed for each a?

Suppose A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, arranged in increasing order. For each ai, the number of non-empty sets B where ai is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1,2,...,ai-1} excluding the empty set, and then including ai. Wait, no, because B can have any elements less than ai, but it must include ai as the maximum.

Wait, more accurately, if I fix ai as the maximum, then the other elements of B can be any subset of {1,2,...,ai-1}, including the empty subset. But wait, B has to be non-empty. So, if ai is the maximum, the other elements can be any subset of {1,2,...,ai-1}, but since ai is already included, the total number of such sets is 2^{ai-1}.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For each ai, the number of subsets B where the maximum is ai is exactly equal to the number of subsets of {1,2,...,ai-1}, because each such subset can be combined with ai to form a set where ai is the maximum. But since B must be non-empty, and ai is included, the subsets of {1,2,...,ai-1} can include the empty set. Because adding ai to the empty set gives {ai}, which is a valid non-empty set.

So, for each ai, the number of sets B with maximum ai is 2^{ai-1}. Because the number of
