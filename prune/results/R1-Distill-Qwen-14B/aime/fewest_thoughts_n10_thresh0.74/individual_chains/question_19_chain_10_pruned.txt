Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic definitions. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. Here, R is 13 and r is 6.

The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The fact that IA is perpendicular to OI might be a key clue here.

I remember that in a triangle, several relations connect the inradius, circumradius, and other elements. Maybe I can use some formulas that relate these.

One important formula is the formula for the inradius: r = A/s, where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter. Another formula is the formula for the circumradius: R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet. Maybe I should consider coordinate geometry. If I can place the triangle in a coordinate system, perhaps with O at the origin, and I somewhere else, that might help.

Wait, but maybe it's better to use vector approaches or coordinate-free geometry. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps using some known properties or lemmas related to the inradius, circumradius, and their positions.

Wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vectors from I to A and from I to O are perpendicular. That means the dot product of vectors IA and IO is zero.

Let me think in terms of vectors. Let me set up coordinates. Let me place the incenter I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then the circumradius is 13, but wait, the circumradius is the distance from O to any vertex, but O is the circumcenter.

Wait, if I is the incenter, and O is the circumradius, but I is not necessarily at the origin. Hmm, maybe it's better to set O at (0,0) because that's the circumradius. Then, the incenter I is some point, and IA
