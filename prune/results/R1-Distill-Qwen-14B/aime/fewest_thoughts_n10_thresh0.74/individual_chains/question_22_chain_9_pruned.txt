Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. The problem says that ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Then, the triangle formed by extending segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, first, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A convex equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length, and all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, opposite sides are parallel, which suggests it's a type of hexagon similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or skewed in some way.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So if I imagine the hexagon, and I extend the sides AB, CD, and EF until they meet each other, they form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

I remember that in such hexagons, the extensions of every other side form a triangle, and the side lengths of this triangle relate to the side length of the hexagon. Since opposite sides are parallel, I can think of the hexagon as being part of a larger triangle, where the hexagon is sort of "inscribed" within it. 

Maybe I can use similar triangles here? Let me think. If the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, then each side of the hexagon is a certain fraction of the corresponding side of the larger triangle. So, perhaps the side length of the hexagon is a scaled-down version of the triangle's sides.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate these to 's'.

I recall that in such a configuration, the side lengths of the larger triangle are proportional to the side lengths of the hexagon. But how exactly?

Wait, maybe I can model this with vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try setting up coordinates for the hexagon.

Imagine placing the hexagon such that the extensions of AB, CD, and EF form a triangle. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let's say the triangle has vertices at points A', C', and E', which are the intersections of the extensions of AB, CD, and EF.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the concept of similar triangles and the properties of the hexagon. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered a "truncated" version of the larger triangle.

I remember that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the sides can be thought of as being cut from the larger triangle by lines parallel to the sides. So, each side of the hexagon is a segment that's cut off from the larger triangle, and the hexagon itself is what's left in the middle.

In such cases, the ratio of the hexagon's side to the triangle's side is the same for all three sides. Let me denote this ratio as 'k'. So, each side of the hexagon would be k times the corresponding side of the triangle.

Wait, but in this problem, the triangle's sides are 200, 240, and 300. So, if the hexagon's side is 's', then s = k * 200, s = k * 240, and s = k * 300. That would mean 200k = 240k = 300k, which is only possible if k = 0, which doesn't make sense. So, my initial thought must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Perhaps the hexagon isn't a simple scaled version, but instead, each side is scaled by different ratios? Wait, but the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal. So, how does this work?

I think I need to consider
