Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: one is a function y defined in terms of some nested functions involving sine, and the other is x defined in terms of similar nested functions involving cosine. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the functions to make it clearer.

The first function is:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]

And the second equation is:
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

I need to find how many times these two graphs intersect. So, essentially, I'm looking for pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations simultaneously. That means substituting one equation into the other, maybe? Or perhaps analyzing the functions separately and then seeing where they overlap.

Wait, but both equations are kind of similar but with sine and cosine and different coefficients. Maybe I can find an approach that works for both.

Let me first understand what f(x) and g(x) are.

f(x) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = | |x| - \frac{1}{2} | \]

And g(x) is:
\[ g(x) = | |x| - \frac{1}{4} | \]

So both f and g are double absolute value functions. Let me try to sketch them mentally or maybe on paper.

For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

The inner function is |x| - 1/2. So the graph of |x| is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). Shifting it down by 1/2, the vertex would be at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, any negative part will be flipped. So where would that happen?

The expression |x| - 1/2 is negative when |x| < 1/2. So for |x| < 1/2, ||x| - 1/2| becomes (1/2 - |x|). So the graph would be a V-shape with vertex at (0, 1/2), going down to 0 at x = ±1/2, then continuing as |x| - 1/2 for |x| ≥ 1/2. So the overall shape of f(x) is a W that's only up to |x| = 1/2 and then a V beyond that. Wait, no, actually, for |x| ≥ 1/2, it's |x| - 1/2, which is a V with slope 1 starting at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So the entire function f(x) is a V that starts at (1/2, 0) going up, and another V on the left starting at (-1/2, 0) going up, and between -1/2 and 1/2, it's a downward V from (0, 1/2) to the points (±1/2, 0).

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Let's see. The inner function is |x| - 1/4. For |x| < 1/4, this is negative, so we take the absolute value, making it 1/4 - |x|. So for |x| between 0 and 1/4, it's a downward V from (0, 1/4) to (±1/4, 0). For |x| ≥ 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4, which is a V with slope 1 starting at (±1/4, 0). So g(x) is a W shape that's flatter near the center compared to f(x).

Now, both f and g are being composed with sine and cosine functions, and then scaled by 4. So let's see what happens when we apply these functions.

Let's first consider f(sin(2πx)). Let me think about the range of sin(2πx). Since sine ranges between -1 and 1, and then taking absolute value, so |sin(2πx)| ranges between 0 and 1. Then, f is applied to that.

So f(|sin(2πx)|) = || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. Let me compute that.

Wait, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So when we do || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |, let's think about the inner part.

| |sin(2πx)| - 1
