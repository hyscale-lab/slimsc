Okay, so I have this math problem from Aimeville. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

There are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given for everyone. Then, there are other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. 

Additionally, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. I need to find how many own all four: the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and the candy hearts.

Hmm, okay. So first, let's think about what each of these numbers represents. The counts for each item are the number of residents who own at least one of them. But since candy hearts are owned by everyone, that's 900. So, the other three items (diamond, golf, garden) have their own counts, but some residents might own multiple.

Wait, but the 437 and 234 are about owning exactly two or exactly three of the four items, right? Because it says "exactly two of these things" and "exactly three." But wait, since everyone has at least the candy hearts, does that mean when they say "exactly two," they mean exactly two of the other three, or including the candy hearts?

I think that's a crucial point. Let me parse the problem again. It says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So every resident has that. Then, the counts for diamond, golf, garden are 195, 367, 562. So those counts include some people who might also have candy hearts and other items.

Then, the problem says, "437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." So, "these things" would refer to the four items: diamond, golf, garden, and candy hearts. Because "these" comes after mentioning all four.

So, that means:

- The 437 own exactly two out of the four, which includes the candy hearts.

Similarly, the 234 own exactly three of the four.

But wait, the candy hearts are mandatory
