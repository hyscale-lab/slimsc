Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is (n-2)*180/n, where n is 12. So (12-2)*180/12 = 10*15 = 150 degrees each. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here, but maybe it helps in visualizing.

The problem mentions that each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, I need to consider all possible lines that form the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon as potential sides for the rectangles.

I think the key here is to figure out how to choose four points in the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. But wait, in a regular polygon, especially a regular dodecagon, not every set of four points will form a rectangle. There must be some symmetry or specific conditions that these points need to meet.

Let me recall that in a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. But in a regular dodecagon, sides and diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of selecting two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, two sides are parallel if the number of vertices they skip is the same. For example, in a dodecagon, each side is a step of 1 vertex, and a diagonal could be a step of 2, 3, etc., up to 5 vertices because beyond that, it starts repeating in the opposite direction (since 12 is even, stepping 6 would be the diameter).

So, to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides. Each pair must be separated by the same number of steps. So, perhaps I need to count how many such pairs of parallel lines exist, and then for each pair, see how they can form rectangles with another pair.

Wait, but rectangles require that the two pairs of sides are both perpendicular to each other. So, in terms of the dodecagon, the angles between these sides must be 90 degrees.

Hmm, but in a regular dodecagon, the angles between sides and diagonals can vary. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle must correspond to two different step sizes (the number of vertices skipped) that are perpendicular to each other in the polygon.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the regular dodecagon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Then, each vertex can be represented as a point on the circumference, with angles at multiples of 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). So, the vertices are at angles 0Â°,
