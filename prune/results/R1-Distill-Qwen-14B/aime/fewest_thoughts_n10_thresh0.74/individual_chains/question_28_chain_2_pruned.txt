Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n/p, and then I have to find m + n + p.

First, let me write down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, so each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical. Maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral? Or maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron might have some nice properties, like the incenter being equidistant from all faces.

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should try to find the volume of the tetrahedron first. Because once I have the volume, I can relate it to the inradius. The formula for the volume in terms of the inradius r is Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * r. So if I can compute the volume and the total surface area, I can solve for r.

But wait, how do I compute the volume of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths? I think I need to use some formula. Maybe the Cayley-Menger determinant? I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, the volume can be found using the determinant of a matrix.

Let me recall the formula. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is:

Volume = √[ CM / 288 ], where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0  1    1    1    1  |
| 1  0  AB² AC² AD² |
| 1 AB² 0  BC² BD² |
| 1 AC² BC² 0  CD² |
| 1 AD² BD² CD² 0  |

So I need to compute this determinant. Let me write down all the squared edge lengths:

AB² = (√41)² = 41

AC² = (√80)² = 80

AD² = (√89)² = 89

BC² = (√89)² = 89

BD² = (√80)² = 80

CD² = (√41)² = 41

So plugging into the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me make sure I get the rows right. The first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], then each subsequent row starts with 1, then the squared distances from that vertex to the others.

So yes, the matrix is correct.

Now, to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That seems complicated, but maybe there's some symmetry I can exploit.

Let me denote the matrix as M:

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

Hmm, I notice that rows 2 and 3 are similar but swapped. Similarly, rows 1 is symmetric in a way. Maybe there's a pattern.

Wait, let me compute the determinant step by step. Alternatively, maybe I can perform row operations to simplify it. Since determinant is invariant under row operations, except for row swaps and scaling.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some symmetry in the problem. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, maybe it's a kind of "equifacial" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tetrahedron where all faces are
