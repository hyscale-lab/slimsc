Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are a bit complicated: one is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and the other is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand what functions f and g are. The problem says f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are absolute value functions of absolute value functions. They create these V-shaped graphs, but with their own transformations.

Let me sketch what f(x) looks like. The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so that would shift the graph down, but since it's inside another absolute value, we have to see where that shift affects the overall shape. Let's think about f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |. So, when |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, the inner expression is positive, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. When |x| is less than 1/2, the inner expression is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| -1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that has its vertex at (0, 1/2) but then bends again at |x|=1/2, creating a W shape, I think. Wait, no, because each side is linear. Let me think again. For x >= 0, f(x) is |x - 1/2|, so that's a V-shape with vertex at (1/2, 0). Similarly, for x <= 0, it's |x + 1/2|, another V-shape with vertex at (-1/2, 0). So overall, the graph of f(x) is a W-shape, with vertices at (-1/2, 0), (0, 1/2), and (1/2, 0). Wait, no, because when |x| is between 0 and 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. So at x=0, f(x)=1/2, and it decreases linearly to 0 at x=±1/2. Then for |x| beyond 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, so it's increasing again. So the graph is a V on top of another V, making a W-shape. So the f(x) function has three turning points: minimums at x=±1/2, and a maximum at x=0.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let me analyze this as well. The inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So, for |x|
