Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem says f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|, and g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Wait, so those are double absolute value functions. Let me write that down:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Hmm, okay. I remember that absolute value functions can create V-shapes or other piecewise linear graphs. So applying absolute value twice might create more layers. Let me try to sketch or visualize these functions.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's think about |x| first. That's a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2: |x| - 1/2 would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, we take the absolute value of that result. So f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Let me consider different intervals for x:

1. When |x| ≥ 1/2: Then |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so ||x| - 1/2| = |x| - 1/2. So for x ≥ 1/2 or x ≤ -1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

2. When |x| < 1/2: Then |x| - 1/2 is negative, so the absolute value would flip it. So ||x| - 1/2| = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So f(x) is a V-shape that has a "W" shape when considering both sides. It's a combination of two Vs. Let me calculate some points to get a better idea:

- At x = 0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- At x = 1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.
- At x = 1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- Similarly, at x = -1/2: f(-1/2) = 0.
- At x = 3/2: f(3/2) = |3/2 - 1/2| = 1.

So f(x) has a minimum at x = ±1/2 with f(x)=0, and maximum at x=0, ±1, etc., with f(x)=1/2, 1, etc. Wait no, actually at x=0, it's 1/2, and as x goes beyond 1/2, it increases by 1/2 each time. Hmm, wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, for |x| >=1/2, f(x) = |x| -1/2. So for x >=1/2, f(x) = x -1/2, which is a straight line with a slope of 1, starting at (1/2, 0). Similarly, for x <=-1/2, f(x) = -x -1/2, which is a line with slope -1, starting at (-1/2, 0). Between x = -1/2 and x =1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, which is an upside-down V with vertex at (0,1/2), going down to (1/2,0).

So f(x) looks like a W on its side, symmetric about the y-axis, with the bottom of the W at x=±1/2, y=0, and the top of the W at x=0, y=1/2, and then it goes up again for |x|>1/2.

Similarly, I need to consider g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let me analyze that.

g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Again, considering |x|, subtract 1/4, then take the absolute value.

So, for |x| >=1/4, the inner expression is non-negative, so g(x) = |x| -1/4.

For |x| <1/4, the inner expression is negative, so g(x) = -( |x| -1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|.

So the graph of g(x) is similar but scaled differently. Let's plot points:

- At x=0: g(0) = |0 -1/4| =1/4.
- At x=1/4: g(1/4)=0.
- At x=1/2: g(1/2)= |1/2| -1/4 =1/2 -1/4=1/4.
- At x=3/4: g(3/4)=3/4 -1/4=1/2.
- At x=1: g(1)=1 -1/4=3/4.

Wait, no, actually, for |x| >=1/4, it's |x| -1/4. So:

- For x >=1/4, g(x) = x -1/4.
- For x <=-1/4, g(x) = -x -1/4.
- Between x = -1/4 and x=1/4, g(x)=1/4 - |x|.

So g(x) is like a W shape too, with minima at x=±1/4, y=0, and a peak at x=0, y=1/4, then it goes up again beyond |x|=1/4.

So, now, the functions are y = 4*g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4*g(f(cos(
