Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, I need to express r² as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

First, I know that a rectangular box has length, width, and height, let's call them x, y, z. The surface area S of a box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume V is xyz. Here, S is 54 and V is 23. So we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 → xy + yz + zx = 27
2. xyz = 23

Now, the problem is about finding the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box because the space diagonal is the longest distance inside the box. So, the space diagonal d of the box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is d/2, so r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize the space diagonal squared, or equivalently, to minimize x² + y² + z², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

I remember that for optimization problems with constraints, Lagrange multipliers might be useful here. So, perhaps I should set up a function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

Wait, but in Lagrange multipliers, it's typically for one constraint. If I have two constraints, maybe I need to use a method involving both. Alternatively, perhaps I can express variables in terms of each other and reduce the problem to fewer variables.

Let me think. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using the volume constraint and substitute into the surface area equation. Let's say, for example, express z from the volume equation: z = 23/(xy). Then substitute this into the surface area equation:

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27

Simplify each term:

xy + (23/y) + (23/x) = 27

Hmm, that might complicate things because now I have two variables x and y. Alternatively, maybe I can use symmetry or assume that the minimal sphere occurs when the box is a cube? Wait, but a cube with surface area 54 would have each face area 54/6 = 9, so each side would be 3, making the volume 27. But in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So the box isn't a cube. Therefore, the minimal sphere probably doesn't correspond to a cube.

Wait, but maybe the minimal diagonal occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible given the constraints? Or perhaps when two sides are equal?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. I've heard that it's possible, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact setup. Let me try to recall.

In the case of two constraints, the gradients of the function to minimize and the constraints should be linearly dependent. That is, there exist multipliers λ and μ such that:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h

So, for our problem:

f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z²
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx - 27 = 0
h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

Compute the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)
∇g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)
∇h = (yz, xz, xy)

So, setting up the equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)
2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can assume symmetry, like x = y, to reduce the number of variables. If x = y, then the equations might simplify.

Let’s suppose x = y. Then, we can denote x = y, and z as another variable.

So, substituting x = y into the constraints:

From surface area: x² + 2xz = 27

From volume: x² z = 23 → z = 23/(x²)

Substitute z into surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27

Simplify:

x² + (46/x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ -27x +46 = 0

Hmm, so we have the cubic equation x³ -27x +46 = 0. Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠ 0
x=2: 8 -54 +46=0 → 0. So x=2 is a root.

Therefore, (x - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x - 2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23  0

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) =0.

Now, set x² +2x -23=0:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4√6]/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

Since x is a length, it must be positive. So x= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈ 3.898.

So, x=2 or x= -1 +2√6. Let me consider x=2 first.

If x=2, then since x=y=2, then z=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box dimensions are 2,2,5.75. Let's compute x² + y² + z²: 4 +4 + (23/4)^2= 8 + (529/16) = (128 + 529)/16 = 657/16 ≈41.0625.

Alternatively, for x= -1 +2√6 ≈3.898, then x=y≈3.898, then z=23/(x²)=23/( ( -1 +2√6 )² )

Compute denominator:

(-1 +2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24 =25 -4√6.

So z=23/(25 -4√6). Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6) =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529 =1/23, so z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Now, compute x² + y² + z². Since x=y, it's 2x² + z².

x² = ( -1 +2√6 )² =1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So 2x² =2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

z²= (25 +4√6)^2 /23².

Compute numerator: (25)^2 + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2=625 +200√6 + 96=721 +200√6.

So z²=(721 +200√6)/529.

Therefore, x² + y² + z²= (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me compute this as fractions:

First term: 50 -8√6 =50 + (-8√6)

Second term: (721 +200√6)/529 ≈ (721/529) + (200√6)/529.

So adding both:

50 + (721/529) + (-8√6) + (200√6)/529.

Convert 50 to 50*(529/529)=26450/529.

So 26450/529 +721/529 = (26450 +721)/529=27171/529.

Similarly, for the radicals:

-8√6 = (-8√6)*(529/529) = (-4232√6)/529.

Add to that 200√6/529: (-4232√6 +200√6)/529= (-4032√6)/529.

So overall, x² + y² + z²=27171/529 -4032√6/529.

Wait, that's a negative term because 4032√6 is much larger than 27171. Hmm, that can't be right because x² + y² + z² is a sum of squares, so it must be positive. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's double-check the computation for z².

I had z = (25 +4√6)/23.

Then z² = (25 +4√6)^2 / (23^2) = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529 = (721 +200√6)/529.

Yes, that's correct.

Then x² + y² + z² = 2*(25 -4√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Wait, 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

But when I add (721 +200√6)/529, which is a positive term.

Wait, 50 is 50, and 721/529≈1.362, so 50 +1.362≈51.362.

Similarly, -8√6≈-8*2.449≈-19.594, and 200√6/529≈200*2.449/529≈489.8/529≈0.922.

So total is approximately 51.362 -19.594 +0.922≈32.69.

Wait, that's a positive number, so okay.

So, x²+y²+z² ≈32.69, which is less than the 41.0625 when x=2.

So the minimal value would be around 32.69, which is when x=y= -1+2√6 and z=(25+4√6)/23.

So, that suggests that the minimal space diagonal squared is about 32.69, so r² is about 8.1725.

But we need to compute it exactly.

So exact value is 2*(25 -4√6)+(721 +200√6)/529.

Let me compute this as fractions.

First, 2*(25 -4√6) =50 -8√6.

Then, adding (721 +200√6)/529:

50 = (50*529)/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6 = (-8√6*529)/529= (-4232√6)/529.

Adding (721 +200√6)/529:

So total is (26450 +721)/529 + (-4232√6 +200√6)/529.

Which is (27171)/529 + (-4032√6)/529.

So, x²+y²+z²=(27171 -4032√6)/529.

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Let me see if this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. By assuming x=y, I might have constrained the problem too much, and perhaps the minimal space diagonal occurs when all x, y, z are different.

Alternatively, maybe using Lagrange multipliers without assuming symmetry is better.

Let me try that.

We have the function f(x, y, z)=x² + y² + z² to minimize, subject to g(x, y, z)=xy + yz + zx=27 and h(x, y, z)=xyz=23.

Using Lagrange multipliers for two constraints, we set up the equations:

∇f = λ ∇g + μ ∇h

Which gives:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz) ...(1)

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz) ...(2)

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy) ...(3)

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx =27 ...(4)

xyz=23 ...(5)

Hmm, this seems a system of five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ.

It's a nonlinear system, which might be difficult to solve. But perhaps we can find ratios between x, y, z.

Let me subtract equation (1) and (2):

2x -2y = λ[(y + z) - (x + z)] + μ[yz - xz]

Simplify:

2(x - y) = λ(y - x) + μ z(y -x)

Factor (y -x) = -(x - y):

2(x - y) = -(x - y)(λ + μ z)

If x ≠ y, then we can divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = -(λ + μ z)

Similarly, subtract equation (2)-(3):

2y -2z = λ[(x + z) - (x + y)] + μ[xz - xy]

Simplify:

2(y - z) = λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y)

Factor (z - y) = -(y - z):

2(y - z) = -(y - z)(λ + μ x)

If y ≠ z, divide both sides by (y - z):

2 = -(λ + μ x)

So now we have:

From first subtraction: 2 = -(λ + μ z) ...(6)

From second subtraction: 2 = -(λ + μ x) ...(7)

Therefore, from (6) and (7):

-(λ + μ z)= -(λ + μ x)

Which implies μ z = μ x.

If μ ≠0, then z =x.

Similarly, if we subtract equation (1)-(3):

2x -2z = λ[(y + z) - (x + y)] + μ[yz - xy]

Simplify:

2(x - z) = λ(z -x) + μ y(z -x)

Factor (z -x)= -(x - z):

2(x - z)= -(x - z)(λ + μ y)

If x ≠ z, divide both sides:

2= -(λ + μ y)

So now, from previous results, we have:

From (6): 2= -(λ + μ z)

From (7): 2= -(λ + μ x)

From this subtraction: 2= -(λ + μ y)

So, we have:

λ + μ z = -2 ...(8)

λ + μ x = -2 ...(9)

λ + μ y = -2 ...(10)

So, from (8) and (9): μ z = μ x → if μ ≠0, then z =x.

Similarly, from (9) and (10): μ x = μ y → if μ ≠0, then x=y.

Thus, if μ ≠0, then x = y = z, implying the box is a cube. But wait, earlier when I assumed x=y, it didn't give a cube. So, perhaps this suggests that our initial assumption that x=y=z is not possible because the volume and surface area don't match a cube.

Indeed, for a cube, surface area is 6x²=54 →x²=9→x=3. Then volume would be 27, but in our problem, the volume is 23. So, it's not a cube. Therefore, the assumption that μ ≠0 leads to a contradiction because it would require a cube, which isn't the case.

Therefore, μ must be zero.

If μ=0, then from equations (6): 2= -(λ +0) → λ= -2.

Similarly, from (8): λ +0 = -2 → λ= -2, which is consistent.

So now, with μ=0 and λ=-2, let's substitute back into the original equations (1), (2), (3):

Equation (1): 2x = (-2)(y + z) + 0 → 2x = -2(y + z) → x = -(y + z)

Similarly, equation (2): 2y = (-2)(x + z) → 2y = -2x -2z → y = -x -z

Equation (3): 2z = (-2)(x + y) → z = -x - y

Wait, but from equation (1), x = -(y + z). From equation (2), y = -(x + z). Substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2):

y = -[ -(y + z) + z ] = -[ -y - z + z ] = -[ -y ] = y

Which gives y = y, which is a tautology. Similarly, equation (3) gives z = -x - y.

But from equation (1): x = -(y + z). Substitute z from equation (3): z = -x - y.

So x = -(y + (-x - y)) = -(y -x - y) = -(-x) =x.

Which again is a tautology. So, no new information. So, we have x = -(y + z), and z = -x - y.

But we can express variables in terms of each other.

Let me express z = -x - y.

Now, substitute into the constraints.

First, surface area: xy + yz + zx =27.

Substitute z:

xy + y*(-x - y) + x*(-x - y) =27

Simplify:

xy -xy - y² -x² -xy=27

Combine like terms:

xy -xy is 0, so:

- y² -x² -xy =27

Which is:

x² + y² + xy = -27

But x and y are lengths, so x² + y² + xy is positive, but right side is negative. Impossible. Therefore, this can't be.

Hmm, that suggests that our assumption that μ=0 leads to no solution because it gives an impossible equation. Therefore, perhaps the assumption that x ≠ y and x ≠ z is incorrect, meaning that maybe some variables are equal.

Wait, another approach: perhaps two variables are equal, say x=y, but not all three.

Earlier, I tried x=y and got a solution, but when I assumed x=y=z, which led to a cube, which isn't the case. So, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, not all three.

So, earlier, when I set x=y, I got two solutions for x: x=2 and x= -1 +2√6. The solution x=2 gave a box with dimensions 2,2,23/4, and the other solution gave x=y≈3.898 and z≈(25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

Wait, but when x=y= -1 +2√6≈3.898, z≈1.513, and then x²+y²+z²≈3.898²+3.898²+1.513²≈15.193 +15.193 +2.289≈32.675.

Which is less than when x=2. So, perhaps that's the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to proceed without assuming symmetry.

But the Lagrange multiplier approach seems leading to a problem where μ=0 and constraints are impossible, which suggests that perhaps the minimal occurs on the boundary, but in this problem, all variables are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

Wait, perhaps using some inequality to relate x² + y² + z² to the given constraints.

We have the surface area S=2(xy + yz + zx)=54 → xy + yz + zx=27.

Volume V=xyz=23.

We need to find the minimal value of x² + y² + z².

I know that for positive real numbers, x² + y² + z² ≥ (xy + yz + zx), but in our case, that would give x² + y² + z² ≥27. But in our earlier case, when x=y=2, x²+y²+z²=8 + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625>27, which is okay. But when x=y≈3.898, x² + y² + z²≈32.675>27, which is still okay. So, perhaps the minimal is higher than 27, but we need to find the exact minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the inequality between quadratic and cubic terms.

Let me think. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but perhaps it's messy. Alternatively, I can use substitution.

Since we have two equations:

1. xy + yz + zx=27
2. xyz=23

Let me consider variables a=x, b=y, c=z.

We can think of this as a system where we can express variables in terms of each other.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution variables u=1/x, v=1/y, w=1/z.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using homogenization.

Wait, another thought: perhaps express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

I can recall that (x + y + z)^2 =x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). We know that xy + yz +zx=27, so (x + y + z)^2 =x² + y² + z² +54.

So, if I can find x + y + z, then I can find x² + y² + z².

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps using the inequality that relates x + y + z to the volume.

But I don't recall a direct inequality for that.

Wait, perhaps using AM ≥ GM on x, y, z:

(x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3)=23^(1/3)≈2.84.

But that only gives a lower bound for x + y + z, but not sure if it's tight.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Express x² + y² + z² in terms of S and P, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of u, v, w, where u=xy, v=yz, w=zx.

Then, u + v + w=27, and xyz=23.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider the symmetric nature of the problem. Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal. So, let's suppose x=y, as I did earlier.

So, x=y, then z=23/(x²).

Then, surface area: x² + 2xz=27.

Substitute z: x² +2x*(23/x²)=27 → x² +46/x=27.

Which leads to x³ -27x +46=0, which has roots x=2 and x=-1 ± 2√6.

We saw that x=2 gives a valid solution, and x=-1 +2√6≈3.898 also gives a valid solution, which gives a smaller x² + y² + z².

So, perhaps the minimal occurs at x=y= -1 +2√6, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Thus, x² + y² + z²=2*(25 -4√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Wait, but this seems messy, but perhaps it can be simplified.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

First, compute 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

Now, compute (721 +200√6)/529.

So, adding these:

50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

To combine terms, let's express all terms over 529:

50 = (50*529)/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6 = (-8√6 *529)/529= (-4232√6)/529.

Adding (721 +200√6)/529:

So total numerator:26450 +721 + (-4232√6 +200√6)=27171 -4032√6.

Thus, x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032√6)/529.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Let me check if 27171 and 4032 have a common factor.

27171 ÷3=9057, which is ÷3=3019, which is prime? Not sure. 4032 ÷3=1344.

So, 27171 -4032√6 =3*(9057 -1344√6).

But 529 is 23², which is prime squared, so unless 23 divides the numerator, we can reduce the fraction.

Check if 23 divides 27171: 27171 ÷23= let's compute 23*1181=27163, 27171-27163=8, so no, remainder 8.

Similarly, 4032 ÷23: 23*175=4025, 4032-4025=7, so no.

Thus, the fraction is (27171 -4032√6)/529, which cannot be simplified further.

Thus, r²=(x² + y² + z²)/4= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute x² + y² + z² when x=y= -1 +2√6 and z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Wait, let me compute x².

x= -1 +2√6, so x²= (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2√6)=1 +24 -4√6=25 -4√6.

Similarly, z= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, z²= [ (25)^2 + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2 ] / (23)^2= [625 + 200√6 + 96]/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z²=2*(25 -4√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Compute 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

So, 50 + (721/529) -8√6 + (200√6)/529.

Compute 50 as 50*(529/529)=26450/529.

721/529 is just 721/529.

So, 26450 +721=27171.

Similarly, -8√6 is -8√6*(529/529)= -4232√6/529.

Adding 200√6/529: (-4232√6 +200√6)/529= (-4032√6)/529.

Thus, overall:

x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Therefore, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, but this expression is messy, and I'm not sure if I can simplify it further. Let me check if 27171 and 4032 can be divided by something.

27171 ÷3=9057, 4032 ÷3=1344.

So, factor 3:

(27171 -4032√6)/2116=3*(9057 -1344√6)/2116.

But 9057 and 1344: 9057 ÷3=3019, 1344 ÷3=448.

So, 3*(3*(3019 -448√6))/2116=9*(3019 -448√6)/2116.

But 2116=46²= (2*23)^2=4*529.

Not sure if 3019 and 448 have a common factor. 448=64*7, 3019 ÷7=431.285… not an integer. So, perhaps no.

Thus, the fraction reduces to (27171 -4032√6)/2116, which is already in simplest terms since numerator and denominator share no common factors.

But wait, 27171 and 4032: Let me compute GCD(27171,4032).

Compute GCD(4032,27171):

27171 ÷4032=6, remainder 27171-6*4032=27171-24192=2979.

Now GCD(4032,2979):

4032 ÷2979=1, remainder 4032-2979=1053.

GCD(2979,1053):

2979 ÷1053=2, remainder 2979-2106=873.

GCD(1053,873):

1053 ÷873=1, remainder 180.

GCD(873,180):

873 ÷180=4, remainder 873-720=153.

GCD(180,153):

180 ÷153=1, remainder 27.

GCD(153,27):

153 ÷27=5, remainder 18.

GCD(27,18)=9.

So, GCD is 9.

Thus, numerator and denominator share a GCD of 9.

Wait, numerator is 27171 -4032√6, which is 9*(3019 -448√6).

Denominator is 2116, which is 4*529. 529 is 23², which is prime.

2116 ÷9 is not integer, so the fraction can't be simplified further in terms of integer coefficients. Therefore, the expression (27171 -4032√6)/2116 is the simplest form.

But wait, the problem says r² can be written as p/q, where p and q are coprime positive integers. But in my case, r² is expressed as (27171 -4032√6)/2116, which includes a radical. That can't be expressed as a simple fraction p/q because of the √6 term. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait a second, that suggests that my initial assumption that x=y might not lead to the minimal value, or maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal value occurs when the box is a cube, but as I saw earlier, that's not possible because the volume doesn't match. So, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but the expression for r² ends up having a radical, which contradicts the problem statement that r² is a rational number p/q.

Hmm, so maybe I did something wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B." So, B is the set of all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. So, the sphere must contain all possible boxes in B. Wait, that changes things.

Wait, I thought it was the minimal sphere that can contain each box individually, but now I think it's the minimal sphere that can contain all boxes in B simultaneously. So, it's the sphere that can contain any box from B, meaning that the sphere must enclose all possible boxes in B, so the sphere must have a radius equal to the maximum of the space diagonals of all boxes in B. Therefore, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, then the radius is half of that maximum diagonal.

Wait, that's a different problem. So, earlier I was trying to find the minimal space diagonal, but the problem requires the maximal space diagonal, because the sphere must contain any box, so it needs to be large enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal.

So, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z², given that xy + yz + zx=27 and xyz=23.

That changes everything. So, my earlier approach was incorrect because I thought it was the minimal sphere, but it's actually the sphere that must contain all such boxes, so the radius is determined by the box with the largest space diagonal in set B.

Therefore, I need to find the maximum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints.

So, how do I find the maximum of x² + y² + z² with the constraints? That's a different optimization problem.

Let me think again.

We have:

1. xy + yz + zx=27
2. xyz=23

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

I can use Lagrange multipliers again, but this time for maximization.

So, the function to maximize is f(x, y, z)=x² + y² + z², subject to g(x, y, z)=xy + yz + zx=27 and h(x, y, z)=xyz=23.

Using Lagrange multipliers for two constraints:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

Which gives:

2x=λ(y + z) + μ(yz) ...(1)

2y=λ(x + z) + μ(xz) ...(2)

2z=λ(x + y) + μ(xy) ...(3)

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx=27 ...(4)

xyz=23 ...(5)

Again, this is a system of equations. Let me see if I can find a solution.

If I assume symmetry, perhaps x=y=z, but as before, that gives a cube which doesn't satisfy the volume. So, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps two variables are equal, say x=y≠z.

So, set x=y.

Then, from constraint (4): x² +2xz=27.

From constraint (5):x² z=23→z=23/x².

Substitute into surface area equation:

x² +2x*(23/x²)=27→x² +46/x=27.

Multiply both sides by x: x³ +46=27x→x³ -27x +46=0.

Which is the same equation as before, with solutions x=2 and x= -1±2√6.

So, x=2 is a solution, leading to z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box is 2x2x5.75, with space diagonal sqrt(2² +2² +5.75²)=sqrt(4+4+33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.408.

Alternatively, the other solution is x= -1 +2√6≈3.898, and z=23/(x²)=23/(25 -4√6)= [23*(25 +4√6)]/[ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ]= [23*(25 +4√6)]/(625 -96)= [23*(25 +4√6)]/529= (25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

So, the box dimensions are approximately 3.898x3.898x1.513, and the space diagonal is sqrt(3.898² +3.898² +1.513²)≈sqrt(15.193+15.193+2.289)=sqrt(32.675)≈5.716.

Wait, but that's smaller than the previous diagonal of ≈6.408.

But since we are trying to find the maximum space diagonal, the first case where x=2 gives a larger diagonal. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when x=2, y=2, z=23/4=5.75.

Wait, but how do I know that this is the maximum? Maybe there's another box with different dimensions that gives a larger diagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one of the sides is as large as possible, making the space diagonal larger.

But given the constraints, we need to satisfy both surface area and volume.

Wait, perhaps the maximum occurs when one side is as large as possible, and the other two sides are as small as possible.

But how?

Let me consider that when one variable approaches zero, the others adjust accordingly, but since volume is fixed at 23, if one variable approaches zero, the others must approach infinity, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the space diagonal is maximized when one variable is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible, but still satisfying the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps using the AM ≥ GM inequality for the terms x², y², z².

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that to maximize x² + y² + z², given fixed values of xy + yz +zx and xyz, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are as small as possible, and the third is as large as possible, subject to the constraints.

So, let's set x=y and try to find the maximum.

Wait, but earlier when I set x=y, the solutions gave me a small and a larger diagonal. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when x=y=2, z=23/4=5.75.

Alternatively, perhaps when x≠y≠z, the space diagonal can be larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, but let me test that.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Lagrange multiplier method again, but this time considering that the maximum occurs when variables are unequal.

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use the method of substitution.

Let me consider that for fixed surface area and volume, the maximum of x² + y² + z² occurs when the box is as "stretched" as possible, i.e., when two dimensions are as small as possible, and the third is as large as possible.

But how can I formalize this?

Let me assume that the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, say x=y, then I can find the maximum as the solution for x=2, which gives a larger diagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, given the constraints.

Let me try to find the maximum possible value of x, given that y and z are positive real numbers.

From the volume constraint: xyz=23→ yz=23/x.

From the surface area constraint: xy + yz + zx=27.

Substitute yz=23/x:

x(y + z) + yz=27 →x(y + z) +23/x=27.

Let me denote s=y + z and p=yz=23/x.

So, from the above equation: x s +23/x=27.

We also know that for positive y and z, s² ≥4p (from AM ≥ GM: (y + z)/2 ≥ sqrt(yz) → s² ≥4p).

So, s² ≥4*(23/x).

Now, from x s +23/x=27, let me solve for s:

s=(27 -23/x)/x=27/x -23/x².

So, s=27/x -23/x².

Now, we have s² ≥4*(23/x).

So, (27/x -23/x²)² ≥92/x.

Multiply both sides by x² (since x>0):

(27x -23)^2 ≥92x.

Expand (27x -23)^2=729x² -1242x +529.

So, 729x² -1242x +529 ≥92x.

Bring all terms to left:

729x² -1242x -92x +529 ≥0 →729x² -1334x +529 ≥0.

So, solve 729x² -1334x +529 ≥0.

Let me find the roots of 729x² -1334x +529=0.

Compute discriminant D=1334² -4*729*529.

Compute 1334²: 1334*1334.

Let me compute 1334^2:

1334 *1334: Let's compute (1300 +34)^2=1300² +2*1300*34 +34²=1,690,000 +88,400 +1,156=1,690,000+88,400=1,778,400+1,156=1,779,556.

4*729*529=4*729=2916; 2916*529.

Compute 2916 *529:

First, compute 2916 *500=1,458,000.

Then, 2916*29=2916*(30-1)=87,480 -2,916=84,564.

So total:1,458,000 +84,564=1,542,564.

Thus, D=1,779,556 -1,542,564=236,992.

Now, sqrt(D)=sqrt(236,992). Let me see: 487^2=237,169, which is close. 486²=236,196. So, sqrt(236,992) is between 486 and 487.

Compute 486^2=236,196.

236,992-236,196=796.

So, 486 + 796/(2*486)=486 +796/972≈486 +0.819≈486.819.

So, roots are x=(1334 ±486.819)/(2*729).

Compute x1=(1334 +486.819)/1458≈1820.819/1458≈1.249.

x2=(1334 -486.819)/1458≈847.181/1458≈0.582.

So, the quadratic is positive when x ≤0.582 or x≥1.249.

But x must be positive and greater than zero. So, the inequality 729x² -1334x +529 ≥0 holds when x ≤0.582 or x≥1.249.

But we are seeking the maximum x, so x must be ≥1.249.

Thus, the maximum possible x is when x approaches infinity, but given the constraints, that's not possible. Wait, no, because as x increases, y and z must adjust to satisfy the constraints.

Wait, but in reality, x can't be larger than a certain value because of the product constraints.

Wait, perhaps the maximum x occurs when y and z are as small as possible. But given that y and z are positive, perhaps the maximum x is when y=z.

Wait, but when y=z, we can find x in terms of y.

Let me try that.

Set y=z.

Then, from the surface area: xy + yz + zx= x y + y² +x y=2xy + y²=27.

From the volume: x y²=23→x=23/(y²).

Substitute into surface area equation:

2*(23/(y²))*y + y²=27 →46/y + y²=27.

Multiply both sides by y:46 + y³=27y →y³ -27y +46=0.

Which is the same equation as before. So, roots y=2, and y= (-27 ±sqrt(729 - 138))/2= (-27 ±sqrt(591))/2. But only positive roots are y=2 and y=( -27 +sqrt(729 -4*1*46) )/2= (-27 +sqrt(591))/2≈(-27 +24.31)/2≈(-2.69)/2≈-1.345, which is negative. So, only y=2 is valid.

Thus, when y=z=2, x=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box dimensions are 5.75,2,2, with space diagonal sqrt(5.75² +2² +2²)=sqrt(33.0625 +4 +4)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.408.

So, this seems to be the maximum space diagonal.

Wait, because if I try to make x larger than 5.75, then y and z would have to be smaller, but their product would have to be 23/x, which would require y and z to be smaller, but then their sum would have to satisfy the surface area equation.

But when I set x=5.75, y=z=2, it's a valid solution.

If I try to make x larger than 5.75, say x=6, then yz=23/6≈3.833.

Then, the surface area equation: xy + yz + zx=6y +6z + yz=27.

But yz=3.833, so 6(y + z) +3.833=27→6(y + z)=23.167→y + z≈3.861.

But with y + z≈3.861 and yz≈3.833, solving for y and z:

The quadratic equation: t² -3.861 t +3.833=0.

Discriminant D≈14.91 -15.332≈-0.422, which is negative. So no real solutions. Thus, x cannot be 6.

Similarly, trying x=5.75 is the maximum possible because beyond that, y and z can't satisfy the constraints.

Thus, the maximum space diagonal occurs when the box has dimensions 5.75,2,2, giving a space diagonal of sqrt(5.75² +2² +2²)=sqrt(33.0625 +4 +4)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.408.

Thus, the radius r is half of that, so r=6.408/2=3.204.

But let's compute it exactly.

x=23/4, y=z=2.

Compute x² + y² + z²= (23/4)^2 +2^2 +2^2= (529/16) +4 +4=529/16 +8=529/16 +128/16=657/16.

So, r²= (x² + y² + z²)/4= (657/16)/4=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Simplify 657 and 64: 657 ÷3=219, 64 is 2^6, no common factors. Thus, 657 and 64 are coprime.

Thus, r²=657/64→p=657, q=64, p+q=657+64=721.

So, the answer is 721.


To determine the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the maximum space diagonal of such boxes. The space diagonal \( d \) of a box with dimensions \( x, y, z \) is given by \( d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \). The radius \( r \) is half of this diagonal, so \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} \).

Given the constraints:
1. Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \) ⟹ \( xy + yz + zx = 27 \)
2. Volume: \( xyz = 23 \)

We aim to maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). By assuming symmetry and setting two variables equal, we find that the maximum space diagonal occurs when \( x = 5.75 \), \( y = 2 \), and \( z = 2 \). This gives:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = \frac{529}{16} + 4 + 4 = \frac{657}{16}
\]

Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{657}{64} \). The fraction \( \frac{657}{64} \) is in simplest terms, with \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

**Answer:** \boxed{721}
