Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. The question is asking how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, I remember this is a type of combinatorial game. These usually involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win.

So, the key here is to find all n where Bob can force a win, meaning that Alice is in a losing position when the game starts. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position for the first player, Bob can win.

Let me try to model this. I'll define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L) for the player whose turn it is.

Base cases:
- If n = 0, the game is over. So, the player who just moved wins. But since n=0 is the end, the player to move now can't, so this is a losing position. Wait, no, actually, if it's your turn and there are no tokens left, you lose because you can't make a move. So n=0 is a losing position.

Wait, but in some games, n=0 is not considered a position because the game ends when the last token is taken. So perhaps the base case is n=1: if there's 1 token, the player can take it and win. So n=1 is a winning position.

Similarly, n=0 is a terminal state where the game has ended. So perhaps the base cases are n=1, 2, 3, 4, etc., with the standard moves.

Wait, but in this problem, the player can take 1 or 4 tokens each turn. So let's list out the positions starting from n=0.

n=0: losing because no move can be made.
n=1: can take 1, leaving 0 for the opponent, who then loses. So n=1 is a winning position for the current player.
n=2: take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. Or take 1 again? Wait, no—each turn, you can take 1 or 4. So from n=2, you can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. But n=1 is a winning position for the opponent because they can take the last token. Alternatively, can you take 4? No, because n=2 < 4. So from n=2, the only move is to n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player.

Wait, no—if from n=2, you can only move to n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is a losing position.

n=3: similar logic. From 3, you can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is a losing position for the opponent). So if you take 1, opponent is at n=2, which is losing for them, meaning you can win. So n=3
