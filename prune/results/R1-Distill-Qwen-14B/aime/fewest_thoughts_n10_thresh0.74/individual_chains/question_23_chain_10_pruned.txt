Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. The transverse axis length is 2a, where a² = 20, so a = 2√5. The conjugate axis length is 2b, with b² = 24, so b = 2√6.

The problem says that points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, with its diagonals intersecting there.

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Hmm, wait, actually, I think that's correct. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C must be (-x, -y), since the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, points B and D would be some (p, q) and (-p, -q), I suppose.

But wait, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distances between consecutive points are equal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parameterize the points on the hyperbola. Let me think.

The hyperbola can be parameterized using hyperbolic functions. So, any point on the hyperbola can be written as (√20 secθ, √24 tanθ), but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here.

Alternatively, since the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, perhaps we can represent the points as follows:

Let’s say points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, and points B and D are also symmetric. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B is (s, t), so D is (-s, -t).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.

But wait, another approach:
