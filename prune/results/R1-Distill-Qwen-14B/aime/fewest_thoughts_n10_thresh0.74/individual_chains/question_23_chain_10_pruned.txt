Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis.

Now, we have four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, important point: the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola.

I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals of the rhombus, and I need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD², such that this number is less than BD² for all possible such rhombi. Wait, actually, wait. The question says the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, it's like the supremum of the lower bounds, right? That is, the smallest value that BD² can approach but not reach, so that all BD² are greater than this value. So, essentially, I need to find the minimum possible BD² such that for any rhombus, BD² is at least this value. So, the answer would be the minimal BD² possible, but since we have to take the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, perhaps it's the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of what BD² can be. Since ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then each diagonal is symmetric about the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.

Given that all four points lie on the hyperbola, that must satisfy the hyperbola equation.

Let me try to model this. Let's say that the diagonals are AC and BD. Let's let AC be a diagonal along some line, and BD along another, perpendicular line.

But since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps the diagonals are along the axes, but no, not necessarily. Wait, no, because a rhombus can have its diagonals at any angle, as long as they are perpendicular.

But given that the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin, the rhombus can be oriented in various ways.

Wait, the diagonals intersect at the origin, so if AC is a diagonal, then points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin. Similarly, points B and D are symmetric with respect to the origin.

So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. The sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.

So, the length AB must equal BC, and so on.

Let me compute AB² and BC² in terms of coordinates.

Point A: (x, y)
Point B: (p, q)
Point C: (-x, -y)
Point D: (-p, -q)

So, vector AB is (p - x, q - y), so AB² is (p - x)² + (q - y)².

Vector BC is (-x - p, -y - q), so BC² is (-x - p)² + (-y - q)² = (x + p)² + (y + q)².

Since AB² = BC², so:

(p - x)² + (q - y)² = (x + p)² + (y + q)².

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (p² - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²)
Right side: (x² + 2px + p²) + (y² + 2qy + q²)

Subtract left from right:

Right - Left = [x² + 2px + p² + y² + 2qy + q²] - [p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y²]

Simplify term by term:

x² cancels, p² cancels, y² cancels, q² cancels.

Left with: 2px + 2qy - (-2px -2qy) = 2px + 2qy + 2px + 2qy = 4px + 4qy.

So, Right - Left = 4px + 4qy.

Since Right - Left = 0 (because AB² = BC²), so 4px + 4qy = 0.

Divide both sides by 4: px + qy = 0.

So, equation (1): px + qy = 0.

Now, since A and B are points on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

So, equations (2) and (3):

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1,

p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Additionally, since the diagonals are AC and BD, which are perpendicular. So, vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.

Vector AC is C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Wait, actually, wait, point A is (x, y), point C is (-x, -y). So, vector AC is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is D - B = (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q).

Wait, but in reality, the diagonals are AC and BD. But in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.

So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.

Vector AC is (from A to C) (-2x, -2y). Vector BD is from B to D: (-2p, -2q).

Wait, actually, no. Wait, point A is (x, y), point C is (-x, -y). So, vector AC is (-x - x, -y - y)
