Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to figure out the length of AP in the given triangle setup. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.

First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram based on the Asymptote code provided. It might help me visualize the problem better. But since I can't draw here, I'll try to imagine it: triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is outside the circle. Then, AD is drawn and it intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is a segment from A to P, where P is the second intersection point of AD with ω.

I remember that tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the two tangents, DB = DC. Hmm, that might be useful later.

Given the sides of the triangle, maybe I can compute some angles or other lengths using the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines. Alternatively, perhaps I can use properties of power of a point, since D is outside the circle and AD intersects the circle, so power of point A with respect to ω might come into play. Wait, but A is on the circle, so its power is zero. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, since D is the intersection of the two tangents, perhaps I can find the length of DB and DC. Let me recall that the tangent from D to ω has length DB = DC. Since D is the exsimilicenter or something? Wait, maybe I should compute the circumradius first.

Wait, the triangle has sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute the semi-perimeter first to see if it's a valid triangle. The semi-perimeter s = (5+9+10)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Okay, so that's fine.

Next, using Heron's formula, the area of the triangle can be found. The area is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = wait, 504 factors: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Hmm, that's not quite right.

Wait, 504 =
