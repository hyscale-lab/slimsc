Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize everything, but since there's an Asymptote code provided, I can get a rough idea. Let me sketch it mentally.

Points A, B, C form triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, the triangle isn't right-angled because 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which isn't equal to 10² = 100. So, it's a scalene triangle.

The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something like that. Then, drawing AD, which meets ω again at P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point to a circle, that point lies on the polar of the chord connecting the points of contact. That might come into play, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, I recall that the point where two tangents meet, like D here, is called the ex-pole or the external homothetic center, but I need to think about properties related to D.

I think the key here might be to use power of a point. Since D lies outside the circle ω, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from D to ω. Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, the power of D is DB² = DC².

Wait, yes, because the tangent lengths from a common external point are equal. So, DB = DC, which means triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

But how does this help? Hmm, perhaps in relating lengths in the triangle or in triangle ABC.

Also, point P is the intersection of AD with ω again. So, perhaps we can use power of point A with respect to some circle, but A lies on ω, so its power is zero, which might not help directly.

Alternatively, maybe using power of point D with respect to ω. Since D is outside, the power is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

Wait, yes. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DP * DA. Because AD is a secant passing through P.

So, if I can compute DB², then I can express DP as (DB²) / DA. But I don't know DA yet.

So, maybe I can first find DA.

Wait, DA is part of the line from D to A, and we can perhaps express DA in terms of DP and AP. Since AP is a segment from A to P on ω, and DA is the entire line from D to A, passing through P, so DA = DP + AP. Or wait, direction matters. If D is outside the circle, and AD intersects the circle at P and A, then AP is between A and P, and DP is from D to P.

Wait, actually, when you have a secant from D passing through P and A, the power of D is DP * DA. But I'm a bit confused about the exact relation.

Wait, let me recall: the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two intersection points of any secant line through D. So, for the secant DPA, the power is DP * DA. Since D is outside, DP is the length from D to P, and DA is from D to A. But in reality, since P is between D and A, DA is longer than DP. So, the formula should be DP * DA = DB².

Wait, no. Let's think carefully. The power of D is equal to DP * DA. But in reality, DP is the distance from D to P, and DA is from D to A, so actually, the power is DP * DP', where P' is the other intersection point. Wait, but in our case, the line DA passes through P and A. So, if we take the power formula, it's DP * DA = DB². But I think more accurately, it's DP * (DP + PA) = DB²
