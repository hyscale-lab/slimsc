Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are both √80, and BC and AD are both √89. I need to find the distance from a special point inside the tetrahedron, called I, to each of the four faces. This distance is supposed to be equal for all faces, and the answer should be in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, with m and p being coprime, and n square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. This point is the intersection of the angle bisectors, but in three dimensions, it's where the bisecting planes meet. The distance from this point to each face is the inradius.

To find the inradius, I think I need the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. The formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area.

So, first things first: I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron. But how?

Given that all opposite edges are equal, AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, it seems like the tetrahedron is "isohedral," but I'm not sure about the exact term. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. I think in such cases, the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.

Maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices to simplify calculations. Let me try that.

Let me place the points such that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin or symmetrically placed. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but let's attempt it.

Let me consider the coordinates:
- Let’s place point A at (a, b, c)
- Point B at (-a, -b, c) to make it symmetric about the origin in x and y.
- Point C at (-a, b, -c)
- Point D at (a, -b, -c)

Wait, I think this kind of symmetric placement could work because each pair of opposite edges would have the same length. Let me check the distances.

Compute AB: distance between A(a,b,c) and B(-a,-b,c):

AB^2 = (a + a)^2 + (b + b)^2 + (c - c)^2 = (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 = 4a² + 4b².

Given AB = √41, so AB² = 41. Therefore, 4a² + 4b² = 41 → a² + b² = 41/4.

Similarly, compute AC: distance between A(a,b,c) and C(-a, b, -c):

AC² = (a + a)^2 + (b - b)^2 + (c + c)^2 = (2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2 = 4a² + 4c².

Given AC = √80, so AC² = 80. Therefore, 4a² + 4c² = 80 → a² + c² = 20.

Similarly, compute AD: distance between A(a,b,c) and D(a, -b, -c):

AD² = (a - a)^2 + (b + b)^2 + (c + c)^2 = 0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2 = 4b² + 4c².

Given AD = √89, so AD² = 89. Therefore, 4b² + 4c² = 89 → b² + c² = 89/4.

So now, I have three equations:
1. a² + b² = 41/4
2. a² + c² = 20
3. b² + c² = 89/4

I can solve these equations to find a², b², c².

Let me subtract the first equation from the second:

(a² + c²) - (a² + b²) = 20 - 41/4
c² - b² = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4

So, c² - b² = 39/4.

From the third equation, b² + c² = 89/4.

So now, we have:
c² - b² = 39/4
c² + b² = 89/4

Adding these two equations:

2c² = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 → c² = 16 → c = 4 (since we can take positive without loss of generality).

Then, from c² =16, plug into the second equation: a² + 16 = 20 → a² =4 → a=2.

From the first equation, a² + b² =41/4 → 4 + b² =10.25 → b²=6.25 → b=2.5=5/2.

So, now, a=2, b=5/2, c=4.

So coordinates are:
A(2, 5/2, 4)
B(-2, -5/2, 4)
C(-2, 5/2, -4)
D(2, -5/2, -4)

Let me double-check the distances:

AB: distance between A and B.

Δx = -2 - 2 = -4; Δy = -5/2 -5/2 = -5; Δz = 4 -4 =0.

AB² = (-4)^2 + (-5)^2 +0 =16 +25=41. Correct.

AC: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4).

Δx = -4, Δy=0, Δz= -8.

AC²=16 +0 +64=80. Correct.

AD: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and D(2,-5/2,-4).

Δx=0, Δy=-5, Δz=-8.

AD²=0 +25 +64=89. Correct.

Good, so coordinates are correct.

Now, I need to compute the volume of tetrahedron ABCD.

One way to compute the volume is using the scalar triple product of vectors. The formula is V = | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6.

But since I have coordinates, maybe I can use coordinates to compute this.

But wait, since I have coordinates for all four points, perhaps I can choose one point as the origin, then express the other points as vectors from it, and compute the scalar triple product.

Let me take point A as the origin for vectors AB, AC, AD.

But actually, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, point A is (2,5/2,4). So vectors from A to B, C, D:

AB = B - A = (-2-2, -5/2 -5/2, 4-4) = (-4, -5, 0)
AC = C - A = (-2-2, 5/2 -5/2, -4-4) = (-4, 0, -8)
AD = D - A = (2-2, -5/2 -5/2, -4-4) = (0, -5, -8)

So vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AC = (-4, 0, -8), AD = (0, -5, -8)

Compute the scalar triple product AB · (AC × AD)

First, compute AC × AD.

Let me write AC as (-4, 0, -8), AD as (0, -5, -8).

The cross product AC × AD is determinant:

i  j  k
-4 0 -8
0 -5 -8

Calculating determinant:

i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Simplify each component:

i: 0*(-8) =0, (-8)*(-5)=40 → 0 -40 = -40 → i*(-40)

j: (-4)*(-8)=32, (-8)*0=0 → 32 -0=32 → j*(-32) (because of the negative sign in front)

k: (-4)*(-5)=20, 0*0=0 → 20 -0=20 → k*20

So AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, compute AB · (AC × AD)

AB is (-4, -5, 0)

Dot product: (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320

So the scalar triple product is 320.

Therefore, the volume V is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.

Wait a second, let me confirm that the scalar triple product gives the volume as 1/6 of the absolute value. Yes, correct.

So V = 160/3.

Now, I need the surface area of the tetrahedron. Since all opposite edges are equal, each pair of opposite faces should be congruent triangles. But to make sure, I should compute the area of each face.

But wait, how many faces? A tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Given the symmetry, each pair of opposite edges being equal, the faces might come in congruent pairs.

Let me think: each face is a triangle. For example, face ABC, face ABD, face ACD, face BCD.

Wait, but given the symmetry, maybe each face is congruent to another? Let me check the edges.

Wait, each face is a triangle with edges: for face ABC, edges AB, BC, AC.

AB=√41, BC=√89, AC=√80.

Similarly, face ABD: AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89.

Face ACD: AC=√80, CD=√41, AD=√89.

Face BCD: BC=√89, CD=√41, BD=√80.

So, each face has sides √41, √80, √89.

Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles since they have the same side lengths. Therefore, each face has the same area. So if I compute the area of one face, I can multiply by four to get the total surface area.

So let's compute the area of triangle ABC.

Given sides a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

Wait, but wait: is triangle ABC with sides AB=√41, BC=√89, AC=√80 a right triangle?

Let me check: a² + b² = c²?

So 41 + 80 = 121. 121 = 11². 89 is not 121. Wait, 41 + 80 = 121, but 121 ≠ 89. So no, it's not a right triangle.

Wait, but 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², but that's not equal to 89. So it's not a right triangle.

So, to find the area of triangle ABC, I can use Heron's formula.

Heron's formula: area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s = (a + b + c)/2.

Compute s:

s = (√41 + √8
