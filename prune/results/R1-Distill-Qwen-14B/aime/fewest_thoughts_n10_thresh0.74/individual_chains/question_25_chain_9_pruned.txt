Alright, let me try to figure this problem out. So, we have 900 residents in Aimeville, each owning a bag of candy hearts. Then, some also own a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, or a garden spade. The numbers are given as 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Additionally, we know that 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four: the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, it's a given, but the others might own more.

Hmm, okay, so this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Inclusion-exclusion helps in counting the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by including and excluding intersections appropriately.

Let me recall the formula for four sets. The total number of elements in the union of four sets A, B, C, D is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the four-way intersection. Mathematically, that's:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But in our case, every resident owns at least the candy hearts, which is D. So, I think D is the universal set here because all 900 residents are in D. So, the union of A, B, C, D is just D, right? Because D includes everyone.

So, |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |D| = 900. Because all residents have the candy hearts, so when you take the union of all four, it's just the total number of residents.

So, plugging into the formula:

900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

Wait, but |D| is 900 because everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, |D| = 900. Then, |A| is 195, |B| is 367, |C| is 562.

So, substituting these:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple-wise intersections) - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

Wait, but if I move the 900 to the left side, it would be 0 = 195 + 367 + 562 - (sum of pairwise) + (sum of triple-wise) - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|.

Wait, maybe I should rearrange the equation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this problem by considering the counts of people owning different numbers of items. The problem states that 437 own exactly two things, and 234 own exactly three things. But since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, the ownership of other items is optional.

Wait, so let's think in terms of how many people own exactly one, two, three, or four items.

We know that each resident owns at least one thing: the candy hearts. So, the total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, exactly four items.

Wait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. How about exactly one and exactly four?

We can denote:

Let E1 be the number of people owning exactly 1 item (only candy hearts, since the others are optional),
E2 = 437 (exactly two items),
E3 = 234 (exactly three items),
E4 = number of people owning all four
