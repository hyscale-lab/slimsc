Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be expressed in a specific form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p.

First, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, the edges opposite each other are equal. That is, AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. So, AB = sqrt(41), CD = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BD = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89), AD = sqrt(89). Hmm, this seems like a symmetrical tetrahedron in some way.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere that touches all faces) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area.

So, first, I need to find the volume V of this tetrahedron, and then find the total surface area S. Then, compute r as 3V/S.

But how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I only know the edge lengths? I think I can use something like the Cayley-Menger determinant. Yeah, I've heard of that. Let me recall the formula.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

|  0   1    1    1    1  |
|  1   0   a²   b²   c² |
|  1  a²   0    d²   e² |
|  1  b²  d²    0    f² |
|  1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

The determinant of this matrix divided by 288 gives the square of the volume. So, V² = |CM| / 288, where |CM| is the determinant.

So, let me assign the given edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41), so a² = 41

AC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80), b² = 80

AD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89), c² = 89

BC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89), d² = 89

BD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80), e² = 80

CD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41), f² = 41

So, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me make sure I'm placing the values correctly.

The matrix is 5x5. The first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1].

The first column is [0,1,1,1,1]^T.

The (1,2) entry is a², which is AB² = 41.

The (1,3) entry is b² = AC² = 80.

The (1,4) entry is c² = AD² = 89.

Then, the (2,3) entry is BC² = d² = 89.

The (2,4) entry is BD² = e² = 80.

The (3,4) entry is CD² = f² = 41.

Let me write it out:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0,
