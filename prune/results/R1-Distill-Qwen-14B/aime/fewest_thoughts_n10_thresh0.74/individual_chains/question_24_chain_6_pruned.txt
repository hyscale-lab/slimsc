Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers, and it has three properties.

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. So, 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies these three conditions. Once I have such a list, I can compute the sum of their squares.

Let me start by recalling some definitions to make sure I'm on the same page.

- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's the unique mode, only 9 appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But in this case, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. So, the median must be an integer that isn't in the list, which suggests that the list has an even number of elements because if it were odd, the median would be one of the numbers in the list. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Let me think.

Wait, if the list has an odd number of elements, say 2k+1, the median is the (k+1)th term. Since all elements are integers, the median will be an integer, but the condition says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, in that case, the median being an integer not in the list would be possible only if the list has an even number of elements. Because for an even number of elements, 2k, the median is the average of the kth and (k+1)th terms. Since the median is an integer and the terms are integers, their average must be an integer, which implies that the two middle terms are either both even or both odd, such that their sum is even, making their average an integer. But in this case, the median is an integer not present in the list. So, that suggests that the two middle numbers are different, and their average is an integer not present in the list.

So, maybe the list has an even number of elements. Let me note that down.

So, the list must have an even number of elements because the median is an integer not in the list. Wait, but let me confirm.

Suppose the list has 5 elements, which is odd. The median is the 3rd element. Since the median is an integer, but it's not in the list, that can't happen because the 3rd element is part of the list. So, the list must have an even number of elements. So, the number of elements, n, is even.

Let me denote n as 2k, where k is a positive integer. So, n=2k.

Now, the median is the average of the kth and (k+1)th elements. Let's denote them as a_k and a_{k+1}. So, the median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, which is an integer, say m, which is not in the list.

So, m is an integer, and m = (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2. Also, m is not present in the list.

So, a_k and a_{k+1} must add up to 2m, and since m is not in the list, a_k and a_{k+1} must both be different from m, but their average is m.

Wait, but a_k and a_{k+1} can be m-1 and m+1,
