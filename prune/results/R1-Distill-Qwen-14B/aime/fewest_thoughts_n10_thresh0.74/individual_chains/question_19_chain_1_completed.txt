Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm supposed to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. Let me see what information I have.

First off, triangle ABC has a circumradius (R) of 13 and an inradius (r) of 6. The circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. They also mention that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, that seems important. I remember that the incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. 

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe that tells me something about the triangle's angles or sides. Let me think—when two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1, but I don't know if that applies here directly because I don't have coordinate geometry info yet.

I also recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) can be found using the formula: OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me plug in the values I have: OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 2*6)) = sqrt(13*(13-12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13). 

Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at A. That means IA is one leg, OI is the hypotenuse, and AO is the other leg. But wait, AO is the distance from the circumcenter to vertex A. Since O is the circumcenter, AO is equal to the circumradius, which is 13. So AO = 13.

So in triangle IAO, which is right-angled at A, we have:

IA^2 + AO^2 = OI^2

Wait, no, actually, if the right angle is at A, then the sides would be IA and AO, with OI being the hypotenuse. Wait, no: in triangle IAO, right-angled at A, the sides would be IA and AO as the legs, and OI as the hypotenuse. So Pythagoras would be:

IA^2 + AO^2 = OI^2

But wait, that's not possible because AO is 13, and OI is sqrt(13). Let me plug in the numbers:

IA^2 + 13^2 = (sqrt(13))^2

IA^2 + 169 = 13

IA^2 = 13 - 169 = -156

Wait, that can't be right. Squared length can't be negative. Did I mess up the right angle?

Oh! Maybe the right angle is not at A but at I? Wait, no, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI, so that would mean that the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So the right angle is at A. Hmm, but that seems to give a negative value for IA^2. That's impossible. So maybe I got the triangle wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's not triangle IAO but another triangle. Let me think. IA is a segment from A to I, and OI is the segment from O to I. So the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees at point I? Wait, IA is from A to I, and OI is from O to I. So if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the lines IA and OI meet at I, forming a right angle there. So the right angle is at I, not at A. So triangle IAO is right-angled at I.

Ah, that makes more sense. I think I misread the problem. So the right angle is at I, not A. So in triangle IAO, right-angled at I, we have IA and IO as the legs, and AO as the hypotenuse. Let's write that down.

So, IA^2 + IO^2 = AO^2

We know AO is 13, IO is sqrt(13), so IA^2 + (sqrt(13))^2 = 13^2

IA^2 + 13 = 169

So IA^2 = 169 -13 = 156

Therefore, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, that's the length of IA.

Now, I remember that the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter. The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. But here, r is 6, so area = 6s.

Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius R as (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides. So area = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

Wait, but I also have another formula for the area: r*s = 6s. So 6s = (a*b*c)/52. So (a*b*c) = 6s *52 = 312 s.

Hmm. Not sure if that's useful yet.

I also know that IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides. The formula for the length of the inradius from vertex A is IA = r / sin(A/2). Wait, let me confirm that. Actually, I think the formula for IA is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite angle A, which is BC.

Wait, let me think. The inradius is at a distance of r from each side, and the distance from the inradius to vertex A would involve the angle at A. Alternatively, I remember that the length of the angle bisector can be used, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, maybe it's better to use trigonometric relationships. In triangle IAO, right-angled at I, so IA is perpendicular to OI. So in triangle IAO, we can write some trigonometric relations.

Wait, but maybe I should recall that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Let me verify that.

Yes, I think that's correct. Because in the triangle formed by the inradius and the angle bisector, the distance from the inradius to the vertex can be expressed as IA = r / sin(A/2). So IA = 6 / sin(A/2). But earlier, we found IA = sqrt(156). So:

6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156)
=> sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156)
Simplify sqrt(156): sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39), so sqrt(156) is 2*sqrt(39).

So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13.

So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Now, from this, we can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.

So cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt((169 -39)/169) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, I remember that in a triangle, cos(A) can be expressed in terms of cos(A/2): cos(A) = 2cos^2(A/2) -1.

So plugging in cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13:

cos(A) = 2*(130/169) -1 = (260/169) -1 = (260 -169)/169 = 91/169.

So cos(A) = 91/169.

Alternatively, 91 and 169 can be simplified. 169 is 13^2, 91 is 13*7. So cos(A) = 7/13.

So cos(A) = 7/13. Therefore, angle A has cosine 7/13.

Now, I need to find AB * AC. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a.

In triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines, we can write:

a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos(A)

But I don't know a, b, or c. But maybe using the formula for area in terms of sides and angles.

Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin(A)

We know the area is also equal to r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. And s = (a + b + c)/2.

But wait, earlier I thought area = 6s, since r =6.

So, (1/2)*b*c*sin(A) = 6s.

Also, from the Law of Sines, we have a = 2R sin(A) = 2*13*(sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2)).

Wait, wait, Law of Sines says a/sin(A) = 2R. So a = 2R sin(A).

We have R =13, so a = 26 sin(A).

But sin(A) can be found from cos(A) =7/13. So sin(A) = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.

So a = 26*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 26*(2sqrt(30)/13) = 2*2*sqrt(30) = 4*sqrt(30).

So side a, which is BC, is 4*sqrt(30).

Now, back to area: (1/2)*b*c*sin(A) = 6s.

We can write sin(A) as 2*sqrt(30)/13. So substituting:

(1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 6s
=> (b*c*sqrt(30)/13) = 6s.

So (b*c) = (6s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

Hmm, but I need to find b*c. Let me see if I can find another equation involving b and c.

Also, from the Law of Cosines: a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos(A).

We have a =4*sqrt(30), so a^2 = 16*30=480.

And cos(A) =7/13.

So 480 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*(7/13).

So, 480 = b^2 + c^2 - (14/13) bc.

Let me write that as b^2 + c^2 - (14/13) bc =480.

But I need another equation. Perhaps the semiperimeter s is (a + b + c)/2, so s = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

Also, from the area equation: (b*c) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

But s is (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2, so let's substitute that into the area equation.

So:

b*c = [78 * (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 ] / sqrt(30)
= [39*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c)] / sqrt(30)
= 39*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/sqrt(30)
= 39*(4 sqrt(30)/sqrt(30) + (b + c)/sqrt(30))
= 39*(4 + (b + c)/sqrt(30)).

So, b*c = 39*4 + 39*(b + c)/sqrt(30)
=> b*c = 156 + (39/(sqrt(30)))*(b + c).

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of b + c and bc. Let me denote x = b + c, and y = bc. Then, we can write equations in terms of x and y.

From Law of Cosines: 

b^2 + c^2 - (14/13) bc =480.

But b^2 + c^2 = (b + c)^2 - 2 bc = x^2 - 2y.

So substituting, x^2 - 2y - (14/13) y =480.

Simplify:

x^2 - [2 + 14/13] y =480
x^2 - (26/13 +14/13)y =480
x^2 - (40/13)y =480.

From the area equation, we have:

y = [78 s]/sqrt(30)

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + x)/2.

So s = 2 sqrt(30) + x/2.

So y = [78*(2 sqrt(30) + x/2)] / sqrt(30)
= [78*(2 sqrt(30) ) + 78*(x/2)] / sqrt(30)
= [156 sqrt(30) + 39x] / sqrt(30)
= 156 sqrt(30)/sqrt(30) + 39x/sqrt(30)
= 156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x.

So y = 156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x.

Now, let's plug this into the earlier equation:

x^2 - (40/13) y =480.

Substituting y:

x^2 - (40/13)*(156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x ) =480.

Compute each term:

(40/13)*156 = (40/13)*13*12 = 40*12=480.

(40/13)*(39/sqrt(30)) x = (40*39)/(13 sqrt(30)) x = (40*3)/sqrt(30) x = 120/sqrt(30) x.

Simplify 120/sqrt(30) = (120 sqrt(30))/30 =4 sqrt(30).

So putting it all together:

x^2 - [480 + 4 sqrt(30) x ] =480
=> x^2 -480 -4 sqrt(30) x =480
=> x^2 -4 sqrt(30) x -960 =0.

So we have a quadratic in x: x^2 -4 sqrt(30) x -960 =0.

Let me solve for x using quadratic formula.

x = [4 sqrt(30) ± sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))^2 +4*960 )]/2.

Compute discriminant:

(4 sqrt(30))^2 = 16*30=480.

4*960=3840.

So sqrt(480 +3840)=sqrt(4320).

Simplify sqrt(4320): 4320=16*270=16*9*30=16*9*30= so sqrt(16*9*30)=4*3*sqrt(30)=12 sqrt(30).

So x= [4 sqrt(30) ±12 sqrt(30)] /2.

We have two solutions:

x= (4 sqrt(30) +12 sqrt(30))/2 =16 sqrt(30)/2 =8 sqrt(30).

x= (4 sqrt(30) -12 sqrt(30))/2 = (-8 sqrt(30))/2 = -4 sqrt(30).

But x is b +c, which must be positive, so x=8 sqrt(30).

So, x=8 sqrt(30).

Now, from earlier, y =156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x.

Substituting x=8 sqrt(30):

y=156 + (39/sqrt(30))*8 sqrt(30) =156 + 39*8 =156 + 312=468.

So, y=468.

But y is bc, which is AB * AC. So AB*AC=468.

Wait, that makes sense? Let me double-check.

We had a quadratic equation leading to x=8 sqrt(30), which is b + c=8 sqrt(30).

Then y= bc=468.

But let me verify with the area.

Area is 6s, where s=(4 sqrt(30) +8 sqrt(30))/2= (12 sqrt(30))/2=6 sqrt(30).

So area=6*6 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30).

From the other area formula: (1/2)*b*c*sin(A)= (1/2)*468*(2 sqrt(30)/13).

Compute that: (234)*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= (234*2)/13 * sqrt(30)= (468/13)*sqrt(30)=36*sqrt(30).

Which matches the area from 6s. So it all checks out.

Therefore, AB * AC = 468.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has a circumradius \( R = 13 \) and an inradius \( r = 6 \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that triangle \( IAO \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} \), we find \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

In the right triangle \( IAO \), applying the Pythagorean theorem gives:
\[
IA^2 + AO^2 = OI^2
\]
Since \( AO = 13 \) and \( OI = \sqrt{13} \), we have:
\[
IA^2 + 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 \implies IA^2 + 169 = 13 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = \sqrt{156}
\]

Using the relationship \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \), we find:
\[
\sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{\sqrt{156}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}
\]
Then, \( \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} \). Using the double-angle identity, \( \cos(A) = 2\cos^2(A/2) - 1 = \frac{7}{13} \).

Applying the Law of Cosines:
\[
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos(A)
\]
where \( a = BC \), \( b = AC \), and \( c = AB \). Substituting \( \cos(A) = \frac{7}{13} \) and \( a = 4\sqrt{30} \) (derived from the Law of Sines), we get:
\[
480 = b^2 + c^2 - \frac{14}{13}bc
\]

Using the area formulas \( \text{Area} = 6s \) and \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}bc\sin(A) \), where \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), we find:
\[
bc = 468
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is:
\[
\boxed{468}
\]
