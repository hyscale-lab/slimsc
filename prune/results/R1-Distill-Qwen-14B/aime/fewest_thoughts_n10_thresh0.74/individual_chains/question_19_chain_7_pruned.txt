Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is given as 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, let me recall what I know about triangle centers and their properties. The circumcenter, O, is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the incenter, I, is the center of the inscribed circle.

The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. I remember that in some cases, the line OI (connecting the circumcenter and incenter) has certain properties depending on the triangle. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry or some vector approach here? Or perhaps there's a formula that relates these centers when they're perpendicular.

Wait, there's a formula related to the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I think it's OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check that. Oh yeah, that's correct. So OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Plugging in the given values, R is 13 and r is 6.

So OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13). Interesting.

Now, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. Maybe I can relate this using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system will help. Let's see, perhaps placing point I at the origin? That might simplify things since IA would then be the vector from the origin to point A.

Wait, but O is the circumradius, which is 13. If I place I at (0,0), then O would be somewhere else, say (h, k). The distance between O and I is sqrt(h² + k²) = sqrt(13). And IA is the vector from I to A, which is just the coordinates of A.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero. So if IA is vector (a, b) and OI is vector (h, k), then a*h + b*k = 0.

But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Maybe there's a better way using triangle properties.

I recall that in a triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c by the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*area). 

So maybe I can express AB·AC in terms of the sides and then use these relations to find the product. Let me denote AB as c, AC as b, and BC as a. So AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a.

So the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

The area is r*s = 6*s.

Also, the area is (a*b*c)/(4*R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13).

So setting these equal: 6*s = (a*b*c)/(4*13). Therefore, a*b*c = 6*4*13*s = 312*s.

Hmm, not sure if this directly helps yet.

Wait, the problem asks for AB·AC, which is b*c. So maybe I can find b*c in terms of other variables.

Let me think about the condition IA perpendicular to OI. I remember there is a relation involving the distance from the incenter to a vertex and the Euler line or something. Alternatively, maybe some formula involving the sides.

Wait, I recall that the length of IA can be found using the formula IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s
