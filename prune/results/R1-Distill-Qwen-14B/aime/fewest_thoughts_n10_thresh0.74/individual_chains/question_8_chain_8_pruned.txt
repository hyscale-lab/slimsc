Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: first, a + b + c = 300, and second, a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

First, I notice that equation 2 is symmetric in a, b, c. So maybe I can factor it somehow or express it in terms of symmetric sums. Let me see.

Looking at equation 2, I can factor terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So equation 2 becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, interesting. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute these into equation 2.

So, replacing:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Simplify each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Combine like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. So now I have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I need to find a way to relate this to the first equation, which is a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I recall that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since I know a + b + c = 300, let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. Maybe I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, P, Q.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So substituting:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3Q

Similarly, a² + b² + c² can be expressed as S² - 2P.

So let me substitute these into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting the expressions:

300(S² - 2P) - (S³ - 3SP + 3Q) = 6,000,000

Now, since S = 300, let's compute each term step by step.

First, compute S²: 300² = 90,000

Then, 300(S² - 2P) = 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600P

Next, compute S³: 300³ = 27,000,000

Then, (S³ - 3SP + 3Q) = 27,000,000 - 3*300*P + 3Q = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q

Putting it all together, the equation becomes:

[27,000,000 - 600P] - [27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q] = 6,000,000

Simplify the left side:

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q = 6,000,000

Combine like terms:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) + (-3Q) = 6,000,000

Which simplifies to:

300P - 3Q = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000

So now I have:

100P - Q = 2,000,000 → Equation (3)

And I also know from the first equation that S = 300, so:

a + b + c = 300 → Equation (1)

And S² = 90,000, and from equation (1), a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2P.

But maybe that's not necessary for now. Let me focus on equation (3): 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Now, I have expressions for S, P, Q. Maybe I can use these to find possible integer solutions.

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, they must satisfy certain conditions. Also, in symmetric equations, sometimes the variables can be equal or have certain relationships.

Let me think about possible cases.

Case 1: All three variables are equal.

If a = b = c, then since a + b + c = 300, each would be 100.

Let's check equation 2: Each term is 100² * 100 = 1,000,000. There are six terms, so 6,000,000. So that works. So (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

But are there other solutions where two variables are equal and the third is different?

Case 2: Two variables are equal, say a = b ≠ c.

Then, a + a + c = 300 ⇒ 2a + c = 300 ⇒ c = 300 - 2a.

Now, let's compute equation 2 with a = b.

Equation 2: a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Wait, let me compute each term:

a²b = a²a = a³
a²c = a²c
b²a = a²a = a³
b²c = a²c
c²a = c²a
c²b = c²a

So adding them up:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a

Combine like terms:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2c²a

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²)

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to compute it. Alternatively, since a = b and c is different, the expression becomes:

2a²b + 2b²c + 2c²a. Wait, but maybe I should plug in c = 300 - 2a.

But perhaps it's better to compute the equation 2 expression.

Wait, I can compute equation 2 in terms of a.

Given a = b and c = 300 - 2a.

So equation 2:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= a^3 + a²c + a^3 + a²c + c²a + c²a

= 2a^3 + 2a²c + 2c²a

Factor 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²)

So, 2a(a² + a c + c²) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2:

a(a² + a c + c²) = 3,000,000.

But since c = 300 - 2a, substitute:

a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ] = 3,000,000

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2

Compute each term:

a² = a²

a(300 - 2a) = 300a - 2a²

(300 - 2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1200a + 4a²

Now, add them all together:

a² + (300a - 2a²) + (90,000 - 1200a + 4a²)

Combine like terms:

a² - 2a² + 4a² = 3a²

300a - 1200a = -900a

Constant term: 90,000

So the expression becomes:

3a² - 900a + 90,000

Factor out 3:

3(a² - 300a + 30,000)

So, the equation is:

a * 3(a² - 300a + 30,000) = 3,000,000

Simplify:

3a(a² - 300a + 30,000) = 3,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

a(a² - 300a + 30,000) = 1,000,000

So now, we have:

a^3 - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0

So, we need to solve the cubic equation:

a^3 - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0

Hmm, solving this cubic might be challenging, but perhaps we can factor it or find integer roots.

Let me try possible integer roots. Since a is a nonnegative integer, and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, so a can be at most 150.

Let me try a = 100: 100³ - 300*100² + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So a = 100 is a root.

So, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide a^3 - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000
          100      -20,000      1,000,000
      --------------------------------
          1    -200    10,000          0

So the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0.

So, now set each factor to zero:

a - 100 = 0 → a = 100.

a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0.

Solve for a:

a = [200 ± sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 ± 0]/2 = 100.

So, the equation has a double root at a = 100.

So, the only solution in this case is a = 100, which gives c = 300 - 2*100 = 100.

Wait, but that's the case where all three are equal, which we already considered in Case 1. So in Case 2, when two variables are equal, we only get the solution where all three are equal. So, no new solutions from this case.

So maybe I need to consider other cases where all variables are distinct.

Wait, but before moving on, perhaps I should consider that c can be one of the variables, but probably the same applies.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach the problem differently.

Another approach: Let's consider the equation 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

We have S = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

We can think of a, b, c as roots of the cubic equation x³ - Sx² + Px - Q
