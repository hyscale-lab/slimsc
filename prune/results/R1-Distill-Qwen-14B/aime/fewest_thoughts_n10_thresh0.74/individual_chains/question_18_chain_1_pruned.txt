Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length and with equal angles between them. 

First, I should probably visualize the dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon, which is a lot, but maybe I can think of it as a circle with 12 equally spaced points. Each vertex is connected to its adjacent vertices by sides, and the diagonals connect non-adjacent vertices. So, the sides and diagonals are the lines that can form the sides of the rectangle.

Now, a rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. In the context of the dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must lie on either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle must be a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

I think the key here is to figure out how to choose such sides and diagonals that form a rectangle. Since the dodecagon is regular, it's symmetric, which might help in counting the rectangles.

Wait, maybe I can approach this by considering the coordinates of the vertices. If I place the dodecagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin, each vertex can be represented as a point on the unit circle. The angle between each vertex is 30 degrees because 360 degrees divided by 12 is 30.

So, each vertex can be labeled as V0, V1, V2, ..., V11, going around the circle. The coordinates of each vertex Vk would be (cos(k*30°), sin(k*30°)). 

Now, for a rectangle to exist inside the dodecagon, its sides must be parallel to two perpendicular diameters of the dodecagon. That makes sense because the sides of the rectangle need to be at right angles. So, maybe I should find all pairs of perpendicular diameters and then count how many rectangles can be formed with those.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the diameters are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, for example, V0 is connected to V6, V1 to V7, and so on. Each such line is a diameter, and they are all perpendicular to each other every 30 degrees. Wait, no, actually, since 12 is even, each diameter is separated by 30 degrees from the next, but they are all diametrically opposite. Hmm, wait, no, actually, the diameters themselves are each separated by 30 degrees because 360/12 is 30.

Wait, but a diameter in a regular polygon connects two opposite vertices. So, in a dodecagon, there are 6 diameters, each connecting a pair of opposite vertices. Each of these diameters is separated by 30 degrees from the next. So, each diameter is at an angle of 0°, 30°, 60°,
