Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, I think. The problem mentions the family of segments PQ which are of unit length, lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each PQ, P is somewhere on the x-axis, Q is somewhere on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, all these segments are in the first quadrant, connecting points on the axes, and each has length 1.

Now, the family F consists of all such PQ segments. The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. So, C is a point on AB, but not on any other PQ in F. And we're supposed to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

First, let me visualize this. We have the coordinate plane, first quadrant. Points O, A, and B form a triangle, probably a 30-60-90 triangle because the coordinates of A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2), which are reminiscent of the unit circle points at 60 degrees and 30 degrees, respectively. Wait, actually, if you think of OA as 1/2, OB as sqrt(3)/2, then OA^2 + OB^2 = (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, so OA and OB are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse 1. So, the triangle OAB is a right-angled triangle at O, with OA = 1/2, OB = sqrt(3)/2, and AB as the hypotenuse. Wait, no, actually, O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is the line segment connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). 

Wait a second, the distance from A to B would be sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is of length 1. Interesting. So, AB is a segment of length 1, lying in the first quadrant, with P at A on the x-axis and Q at B on the y-axis. So, AB is part of the family F. That makes sense.

So, the family F consists of all such segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ is of length 1. So, any such segment can be parametrized. Let me think about how to represent all these segments.

Let me parametrize a general segment PQ in F. Let P be (p, 0) on the x-axis and Q be (0, q) on the y-axis. The distance between P and Q is 1, so sqrt[(p - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2] = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 = 1. Therefore, for any p between 0 and 1, q is sqrt(1 - p^2). So, any segment PQ in F is defined by its point P (p, 0) and Q (0, sqrt(1 - p^2)).

So, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p^2)). So, the family F is all such segments for p in (0,1).

Now, the problem is about point C on AB, except A and B, that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, C is on AB, and for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

We need to find such a point C and then compute OC squared.

So, perhaps C is the point on AB where the envelope of the family F touches AB, or something like that. Or maybe it's the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of F. Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize AB and find the point C such that for all other p, the segment PQ doesn't pass through C.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model AB as a line and each PQ as a line segment, and find the intersection points, then see what point C on AB doesn't lie on any PQ except for AB itself.

Let me first find the equation of AB. Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. To find c, plug in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, any segment PQ in F is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), where p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, the line PQ can be parametrized as well. Let me find the equation of PQ for a general p.

The line PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, q). So, the slope of PQ is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So, the equation of PQ is y = (-q/p)x + q.

But since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can express q in terms of p: q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So, the equation becomes y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2).

So, the equation of PQ is y = [(-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)]x + sqrt(1 - p^2).

Alternatively, we can write it as y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2).

Now, to find the point C on AB that doesn't lie
