Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

It says: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some basic properties. Let me jot down the given equations first.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

I think I can use the logarithm power rule here, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that to both equations.

Starting with the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

So that simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So that's 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, okay. Now, I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So if I let log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k.

That might help. Let me set that up.

Let log_x(y) = k. Then log_y(x) = 1/k.

So substituting into the first equation:

x * k = 10. So equation (1) is x * k = 10.

Second equation is 4y * (1/k) = 10. So equation (2) is (4y)/k = 10.

Now I have two equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. (4y)/k = 10

I can try to solve for variables here. Maybe express x from equation 1 and y from equation 2 in terms of k, then relate them.

From equation 1: x = 10 / k.

From equation 2: 4y = 10k => y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

So now I have x and y in terms of k. But I need another equation to find k. Hmm.

Wait, I also know that log_x(y) = k. Since log_x(y) = k, that means y = x^k.

Because by definition, if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c.

So y = x^k.

But I already have expressions for x and y in terms of k.

From x = 10/k and y = (5k)/2.

So substituting x into y = x^k:

(5k)/2 = (10/k)^k.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can write it as:

(5k)/2 = (10/k)^k.

I need to solve for k here. Hmm. This might not be straightforward because it's an equation involving both k and exponents of k. Maybe taking logarithms on both sides could help.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides.

ln[(5k)/2] = ln[(10/k)^k].

Simplify the right side: ln[(10/k)^k] = k * ln(10/k).

So now, equation becomes:

ln(5k/2) = k * ln(10/k).

Let me write that out:

ln( (5k)/2 ) = k * ln(10/k )

Hmm, I can expand the right side:

k * [ln(10) - ln(k)] = k ln(10) - k ln(k).

So equation is:

ln( (5k)/2 ) = k ln(10) - k ln(k).

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can make a substitution or find a way to express it such that terms can be combined.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express 5k/2 in terms of 10/k. Let me see:

We know that x = 10/k, and y = (5k)/2.

From y = x^k, substituting x:

y = (10/k)^k.

But y is also (5k)/2. So:

(5k)/2 = (10/k)^k.

Hmm, same as before. Maybe I can write 10 as 5*2, so 10 = 5*2.

So (10/k)^k = (5*2 /k)^k = [ (5/k)*(2) ]^k.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, maybe I can express both sides in terms of the same base or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess a value for k. Since k is log_x(y), and x and y are both greater than 1, k must be positive. Let's see if k is an integer.

Let me try k=2.

Check if k=2 satisfies the equation:

Left side: ln(5*2/2) = ln(5) ≈ 1.609.

Right side: 2 * ln(10/2) = 2 * ln(5) ≈ 2 * 1.609 ≈ 3.218.

Not equal. So k=2 doesn't work.

What about k=1?

Left side: ln(5*1/2) = ln(2.5) ≈ 0.916.

Right side: 1 * ln(10/1) = ln(10) ≈ 2.303. Not equal.

k=3:

Left side: ln(5*3/2) = ln(7.5) ≈ 2.015.

Right side: 3 * ln(10/3) ≈ 3*(1.204) ≈ 3.612. Not equal.

k=4:

Left: ln(5*4/2)=ln(10)≈2.303.

Right:4*ln(10/4)=4*(ln(2.5))≈4*(0.916)
