Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola (x²/20) - (y²/24) = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin.

First, I need to understand the setup. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, I think. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, wait, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular.

So, the rhombus is centered at the origin because the diagonals intersect there. So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Given that, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since diagonals intersect at the origin, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v). So, all four points are arranged symmetrically with respect to the origin.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A
