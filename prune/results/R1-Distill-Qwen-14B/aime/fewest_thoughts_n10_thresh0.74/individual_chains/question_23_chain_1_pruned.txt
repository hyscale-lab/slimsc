Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The problem says: Let A, B, C, and D be points on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, okay. So first, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at the origin here, which is given.

Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, hold on, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property. 

So, the diagonals intersect at the origin. That tells me that the origin is the midpoint of both
