Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's asking.

We have a set 𝒜 (I think they meant 𝒜 but wrote 𝒜; maybe a typo? Wait, no, the problem says 𝒜? Wait, no, the problem says 𝓑. Hmm, maybe it's supposed to be 𝓑, let me read again.)

The problem says: Let 𝓑 be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let r be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes in 𝓑. We need to find r², which can be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers. Then, find p + q.

Alright, so we're dealing with rectangular boxes, which have length, width, and height, let's say a, b, c. The surface area is 54, and the volume is 23. We need to find the minimal sphere that can contain any such box, so the sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere must enclose the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. So, r is half of that diagonal, so r² would be (diagonal²)/4.

So, to find the minimal r², we need to find the minimal space diagonal squared, then divide by 4. Wait, no, actually, for each box, the space diagonal is sqrt(a² + b² + c²), so the radius is half that, so r = (sqrt(a² + b² + c²))/2. Therefore, r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, our goal is to minimize (a² + b² + c²)/4, given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

So, first, let's write down the constraints.

Surface area of a rectangular box is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54. Volume is abc = 23.

We need to minimize (a² + b² + c²)/4.

Hmm. So, we can maybe use some optimization techniques here. Since we're dealing with three variables a, b, c, subject to two constraints: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

I think using Lagrange multipliers might be the way to go here. But since it's a problem that likely has symmetry, maybe the minimal space diagonal occurs when a = b = c? But wait, if a = b = c, then the box is a cube. Let's see if that's possible.

If the box is a cube, then surface area would be 6a² = 54 ⇒ a² = 9 ⇒ a = 3. Then the volume would be a³ = 27, but in our problem, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube isn't possible here because the volume is fixed at 23, which is less than 27. So, the minimal
