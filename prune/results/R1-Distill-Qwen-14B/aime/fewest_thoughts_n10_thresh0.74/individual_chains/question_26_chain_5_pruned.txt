Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so first, I should probably sketch this out. But since there's already an Asymptote figure, I can visualize it based on that. Let me think about the properties involved here.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-pole of BC with respect to ω. Alternatively, D is the exsimilicenter or something like that. Wait, maybe D is the exsimilicenter of some circles. Alternatively, perhaps D is the external homothety center?

Wait, tangents from D to ω touch at B and C. So, DB and DC are tangents, which means DB = DC. That's a key point. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Hmm. Also, since AD intersects ω again at P, then AP is a secant line. Maybe we can use power of a point here.

Power of point D with respect to ω: since D is outside the circle, the power is equal to DB^2 (since DB is tangent) which is equal to DC^2. Also, since AD passes through ω at A and P, the power of D should also be equal to DA * DP.

So, Power of D: DB^2 = DA * DP.

So, we can write DB^2 = DA * DP. So, if we let DA = x, and DP = x + AP (since P is on AD beyond A, wait no, A is on the circle, so from D, line AD goes through A and then exits at P. So actually, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which is DA + AP? Wait, no, because A is on the circle, so D is outside, so DA is the segment from D to A, and beyond A is P. So, DP = DA + AP? Hmm, but wait, that's only if P is between A and D, but in reality, since D is outside, P is on the other side of A from D. So, actually, if we denote DA as the length from D to A, then DP would be DA + AP, but I think that's not correct because P is on the extension beyond A. Wait, no. Wait, let's think carefully.

AD is a line starting at D, passing through A, and then intersecting the circle again at P. So, the order is D, then A, then P on the line AD. So, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which
