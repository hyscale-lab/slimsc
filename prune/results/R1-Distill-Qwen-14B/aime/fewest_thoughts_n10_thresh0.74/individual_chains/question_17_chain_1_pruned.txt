Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let me recall that for a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume V is lwh. So, we have two equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius r is d/2, which means r² is (d²)/4. Therefore, r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, our goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing l² + w² + h², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Hmm, okay, so I need to minimize l² + w² + h² with the constraints 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using the method of Lagrange multipliers, but I'm not super confident about that. Alternatively, maybe I can express variables in terms of each other and use some inequalities.

Let me think. We have three variables, l, w, h. It might be helpful to express two variables in terms of the third. But that could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities?

Wait, another thought: for a given surface area and volume, the shape that minimizes the space diagonal (or maximizes the compactness) is likely the cube, but I'm not sure. However, in this case, the volume is 23, which isn't a perfect cube. So, maybe the minimal space diagonal occurs when l, w, h are as close as possible? Hmm, but I don't know if that's necessarily the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps setting up the problem with Lagrange multipliers.

Let me define f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h², which I want to minimize.

Subject to the constraints:
g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) - 54 = 0,
h(l, w, h) = lwh - 23 = 0.

So, I can set up the Lagrangian as:

L = l² + w² + h² - λ(2(lw + lh + wh) - 54) - μ(lwh - 23).

Taking partial derivatives with respect to l, w, h, λ, μ and setting them to zero.

Compute partial derivatives:

∂L/∂l = 2l - λ(2(w + h)) - μ(wh) = 0
∂L/∂w = 2w - λ(2(l + h)) - μ(lh) = 0
∂L/∂h = 2h - λ(2(l + w)) - μ(lw) = 0
∂L/∂λ = - (2(lw + lh + wh) -54) = 0
∂L/∂μ = - (lwh -23) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh = 0
2. 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh = 0
3. 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw = 0
4. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
5. lwh = 23

Hmm, equations 1, 2, 3 are symmetric in l, w, h. So, perhaps the minimal occurs when l = w = h? Let me test that.

If l = w = h = a, then surface area is 2(3a²) = 6a² = 54 ⇒ a² = 9 ⇒ a = 3. Volume would then be a³ = 27, but our volume is 23, which is less. So, it's not a cube. So, the minimal sphere may not be when the box is a cube, but perhaps when two variables are equal, and the third is different.

Wait, that's a common case in symmetric optimization problems. Maybe assuming l = w, and h different. Let's try that.

Let me set l = w = x, and h = y.

Then, the surface area becomes 2(x² + 2xy) = 54 ⇒ x² + 2xy =27.

Volume is x² y =23.

We need to minimize x² + x² + y² = 2x² + y².

So, we have two equations:

1. x² + 2xy =27
2. x² y =23

Let me solve for y from equation 2: y = 23/(x²)

Substitute into equation 1:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) =27

Simplify:

x² + (46/x) =27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x³ +46 =27x

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ -27x +46 =0

Hmm, now we have a cubic equation: x³ -27x +46=0. Let me see if I can find rational roots.

By rational root theorem, possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 → 8-54= -46, -46 +46=0. Yes, x=2 is a root.

So, factor the cubic:

(x-2)(x² + 2x -23)=0

So, roots are x=2 and solutions to x² +2x -23=0.

Which are x=(-2 ± sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4√6)/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

Since x must be positive, only x=2 and x= -1 + 2√6 are possible. Let's compute x= -1 + 2√6: approximately, sqrt(6)≈2.45, so 2*2.45≈4.9, 4.9-1≈3.9, which is positive. So, possible.

But since we set l = w =x, and y=23/(x²). Let's check both roots.

First, x=2: Then y=23/(4)=5.75. So, the box is 2x2x5.75.

Compute 2x² + y²: 2*(4) + (5.75)^2 =8 + 33.0625=41.0625.

Alternatively, x=-1+2√6: compute x numerically, x≈-1 +4.898≈3.898.

Then y=23/(x²)=23/( (approx 3.898)^2 )≈23/(15.19)≈1.513.

Compute 2x² + y²: 2*(15.19) + (1.513)^2≈30.38 + 2.289≈32.669.

Wait, that's smaller than 41. So, this would be the minimal value.

Wait, but is this the minimal possible? Because we assumed l=w.

Wait, perhaps there is a smaller value when l, w, h are all different. Hmm, but given the problem is symmetric, maybe the minimal occurs when two variables are equal. So, perhaps the minimal is when l=w, but h is different.

But to be sure, perhaps I should consider the case where all three variables are different. But that could complicate the system.

Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers, let's see if we can get some relations.

From equations 1,2,3:

Equation 1: 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh =0
Equation 2: 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh =0
Equation 3: 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw =0

Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2:

(2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh) - (2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh)=0
2(l - w) - 2λ(w + h - l - h) - μ(wh - lh)=0
2(l - w) - 2λ(w - l) - μ h(w - l)=0
Factor (l - w):
[2 + 2λ + μ h](l - w) =0

So, either l = w, or 2 + 2λ + μ h =0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 and equation 3:

2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh - [2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw] =0
2(l - h) - 2λ(w + h - l -w) - μ(wh - lw)=0
2(l - h) - 2λ(h - l) - μ w(h - l)=0
Factor (l - h):
[2 - 2λ + μ w](l - h)=0

So, either l=h, or 2 - 2λ + μ w=0.

Similarly, from all these subtractions, it appears that either all variables are equal, or we have some relations on λ and μ.

But if l, w, h are all equal, then we get a cube, but as we saw earlier, the volume would be 27, which is more than 23. So, the minimal case isn't a cube, so perhaps the variables aren't all equal.

Thus, likely, two variables are equal, and the third is different, which is the case we considered earlier.

So, assuming l=w, the minimal occurs at x≈3.898, y≈1.513, giving 2x² + y²≈32.669. But let's compute it exactly.

Wait, when x = -1 + 2√6, let's compute exactly:

x = -1 + 2√6.

So, x² = (-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2 =1 -4√6 + 24 =25 -4√6.

Then y =23/(x²)=23/(25 -4√6).

We can rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

y=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6) =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify denominator:529=23², so 23 cancels:

y=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, y=25/(23) + (4√6)/23.

Now, compute 2x² + y²:

2x² =2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

y²= [ (25 +4√6)/23 ]².

Compute (25 +4√6)^2=625 + 200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

Thus, y²= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, 2x² + y² = (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Wait, but 50 is in terms of numerator over 1, so to add
