Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have a list of positive integers with certain properties. Let me break down the problem and figure it out step by step.

First, the problem states that the sum of all the items is 30. That's a key point because it limits the possible numbers I can use. The next property is that the unique mode of the list is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently, so 9 has to appear more times than any other number. Also, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. Hmm, that's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, especially if the list has an odd number of elements. But here, it's a positive integer not in the list. I'll have to think about how that works.

Let me start by considering the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if I have n elements in the list, 9 has to appear at least twice, but maybe more. Let's see what other constraints exist.

The sum is 30, so the numbers in the list add up to 30. Since 9 is the mode, I'll need multiple 9s, but I have to make sure that the total sum doesn't exceed 30.

Let me think about the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted in order. If there are an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if the median is an integer and not in the list, that implies that the two middle numbers must average to an integer that's not present. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is in the list. But that's a problem because the median would be 9, which is in the list. So that can't happen. So, maybe the two middle numbers add up to an even number, but the median is not in the list. Wait, but the median is an integer, so their average must be an integer, which implies that the two middle numbers have the same parity. So, they're either both even or both odd.

Wait, but if the median is not in the list, then the two middle numbers can't both be 9, because if they were, the median would be 9, which is in the list. So, perhaps the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, making the median 9, which is not in the list. But wait, 9 is in the list as the mode, so that would be a problem. Because if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is indeed in the list. So that's not allowed. So, maybe the two middle numbers are 7 and 11? Their average is 9, but 9 is in the list, which is again a problem. Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the number of elements in the list. Let's denote the number of elements as k. If k is odd, then the median is the middle element, which must not be present in the list. But since all elements are positive integers, and the list must include 9 as the mode, the median can't be 9. So, if the median is, say, 8, but 8 is in the list (since it's part of the list), that would violate the condition because the median is an integer not in the list. So, perhaps the list has an even number of elements, so the median is the average of two middle numbers. Let's think about that.

Let me consider different possible lengths for the list. Let's start with the smallest possible length. The minimum length for a list with a unique mode is at least two, but with the mode appearing more than once, so let's see.

Wait, another thought: The median
