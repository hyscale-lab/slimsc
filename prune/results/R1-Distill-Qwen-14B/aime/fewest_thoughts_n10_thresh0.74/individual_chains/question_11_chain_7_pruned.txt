Alright, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. It's asking for the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, when you have expressions involving z and 1/z, especially when |z| is fixed, there might be some symmetry or properties we can use. Since |z| = 4, that means z is a complex number on a circle with radius 4 in the complex plane.

Let me denote z as 4e^{iθ} because |z| =4, so I can write z in polar form. That might make things easier because then 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, 1/z becomes (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 +144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression is:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, let me compute 4*(75 + 117i) first. 4*75 is 300, and 4*117 is 468. So that term becomes 300 + 468i.

So, the expression is:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 +36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I can write each of these terms in terms of cosine and sine. Remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's distribute each term.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Multiplying this out:

300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, that last term becomes -468 sinθ.

So, the first term is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiplying this out:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ +36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 is -1, so the last term becomes +36 sinθ.

So, the second term is:

(24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i(-24 sinθ +36 cosθ).

Now, adding the real parts and the imaginary parts together.

Real parts from first term: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ)

Real parts from second term: (24 cosθ +36 sinθ)

Adding these: (300 cosθ +24 cosθ) + (-468 sinθ +36 sinθ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts from first term: (300 sinθ +468 cosθ)

Imaginary parts from second term: (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ)

Adding these: (300 sinθ -24 sinθ) + (468 cosθ +36 cosθ) = 276 sinθ +504 cosθ.

So, the entire expression is:

(324 cosθ -432 sinθ) + i(276 sinθ +504 cosθ).

But the problem is asking for the largest possible real part of this expression. So, we're interested in maximizing the real part, which is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So, our goal is to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. Maximizing a linear combination of sine and cosine. I remember that the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, no, actually it's sqrt(A² + B²) because the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). But in this case, it's 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So, the coefficients are A=324 and B=-432.

So, the maximum value would be sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared:

324^2. Let's compute 300^2 =90,000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)^2=300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2=90,000 +14,400 +576= 105, 000? Wait, 90,000 +14,400 is 104,400 plus 576 is 104,976. So, 324^2=104,976.

Now, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2= 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624. So, 432^2=186,624.

So, adding 324² and 432²: 104,976 +186,624= 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600). Let me see, 500^2=250,000, 600^2=360,000. So sqrt(291,600) is between 500 and 600. Let's see:

540^2= (500+40)^2=500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. Oh, perfect! So sqrt(291,600)=540.

So, the maximum value of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify. Because sometimes when you have A cosθ + B sinθ, it's A cosθ + B sinθ, but in our case, it's 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which is the same as A cosθ + B sinθ where B is negative. So, the
