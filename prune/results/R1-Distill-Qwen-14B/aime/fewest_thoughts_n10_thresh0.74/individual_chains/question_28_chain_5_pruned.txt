Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with given edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be expressed in the form m√n/p, and then I need to find m + n + p where m and p are coprime and n is square-free.

First, let me recall what a tetrahedron is. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, six edges, and four vertices. In this case, the tetrahedron is defined by the given edge lengths. The edges are given in pairs: AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. So, it's symmetric in some way—opposite edges are equal. That might mean it's a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere touching all faces) can be calculated if we know the volume and the surface area. The formula is similar to the 2D case with triangles: the inradius r is equal to three times the volume divided by the total surface area. So, r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area.

So, my plan is: find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S. Then compute r = 3V / S.

But to find V, I need to figure out the coordinates of the vertices or find another way to compute the volume given the edge lengths. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe there's a way to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me consider placing the tetrahedron such that point A is at (0, 0, 0), point B is at (x, 0, 0), point C is at (0, y, 0), and point D is at (0, 0, z). But wait, given the symmetry, perhaps there's a better coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the property that in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a disphenoid. I remember that a disphenoid has four congruent triangular faces if all opposite edges are equal and the faces are congruent. Wait, no, in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, but the faces might not necessarily be congruent. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is regular? But no, because the edge lengths are different: √41, √80, √89. So it's not regular.

So, I think the key is to assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that I can compute the volume and surface area.

Let me try this approach. Let me place the tetrahedron in 3D space with vertex A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, let me let vertex B be at (a, 0, 0), vertex C at (0, b, 0), and vertex D at (0, 0, c). So, this places the vertices along the axes.

Given this setup, the edges are:

AB: distance from A(0,0,0) to B(a,0,0) is √[(a)^2 + 0 + 0] = a. But in the problem, AB = √41. So, a = √41.

Similarly, AC: distance from A(0,0,0) to C(0,b,0) is √[(0)^2 + (b)^2 + 0] = b. Given AC = √80, so b = √80.

AD: distance from A(0,0,0) to D(0,0,c) is √[0 + 0 + (c)^2] = c. Given AD = √89, so c = √89.

Wait, but the problem states that AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So, if AB is √41, then CD must also be √41. Similarly, AC = √80, BD = √80, and BC = √89, AD = √89.

Wait, in my current coordinate system, let's compute CD.
