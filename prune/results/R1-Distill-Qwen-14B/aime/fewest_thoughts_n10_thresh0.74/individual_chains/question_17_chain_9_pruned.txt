Alright, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Okay, let's parse the problem again. The set B consists of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The radius squared of this sphere is r², which we have to express as p/q and then find p+q.

First, I think I should recall that the smallest sphere containing a rectangular box will have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius would be half of that. So, if the box has dimensions x, y, z, then the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), and the radius r is half of that. So, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Therefore, to minimize r, we need to minimize the space diagonal, which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints:

1. Surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. Volume: xyz = 23

So, I need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z² with the constraints g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using Lagrange multipliers, where we set up the gradients of f, g, and h to be related through some multipliers.

Wait, but since we have two constraints, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with multiple constraints. So, the gradients of f, g, and h should be linearly dependent.

So, the Lagrangian would be L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - μ(xyz -23)

Then, taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and setting them to zero:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy) = 0

And we also have the constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27

and xyz = 23.

So, we have a system of equations:

1. 2x = 2λ(y + z) + μ(yz)

2. 2y = 2λ(x + z) + μ(xz)

3. 2z = 2λ(x + y) + μ(xy)

Plus the two constraints.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe if we assume that the box is a cube, but wait, the volume is 23, which is not a cube number. So, that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal diagonal occurs when two of the sides are equal, making it a square prism or something like that.

Wait, let me think. If I let x = y, maybe that will simplify the equations. Let's try that.

Let x = y. Then, our variables are x, x, z.

So, the surface area equation becomes 2(x² + xz + xz) = 54 → 2x² + 4xz = 54. Simplify: x² + 2xz = 27.

The volume equation is x² z = 23.

So, from the volume, z = 23 / x².

Substituting into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27 → x² + 46/x = 27.

Multiply both sides by x: x³ + 46 = 27x → x³ -27x +46 =0.

So, let's solve x³ -27x +46 =0.

Trying possible integer roots: factors of 46, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0.

x=2:8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor this as (x-2)(x² +2x -23) = 0.

So, the other roots are from x² +2x -23=0 → x=(-2 ±√(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ±√96)/2 = (-2 ±4√6)/2 = -1 ±2√6.

Since x is a length, it must be positive. So, x=2, or x= -1 +2√6 (since √6≈2.45, so 2√6≈4.90; so -1 +4.90≈3.90).

So, x=2 or x≈3.90.

Now, let's see which one makes sense.

If x=2, then from z=23/x²=23/4=5.75.

So, the dimensions would be 2,2,5.75.

Compute the space diagonal: sqrt(2² +2² +5.75²)=sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.41, so r≈3.205, r²≈10.28.

Alternatively, if x= -1 +2√6 ≈3.90, then z=23/(x²).

Compute x²: [(-1 +2√6)]² =1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6≈25-9.798≈15.202.

So, z≈23 /15.202≈1.513.

So, dimensions are approximately 3.90,3.90,1.513.

Compute space diagonal: sqrt(3.90² +3.90² +1.513²)=sqrt(15.21 +15.21 +2.289)=sqrt(32.709)=5.72, so r≈2.86, r²≈8.18.

Which is smaller than the previous case. So, maybe the minimal r² is when x=y.

But wait, we need to verify if x=2 is a minimum or not, but from the approximate values, the second case gives a smaller r², so perhaps the minimal r² occurs when x=y.

But is that the case? Or could we have a case where all three variables are different and give an even smaller r²?

Alternatively, perhaps symmetry isn't the way, and we need to solve the Lagrangian equations properly.

Let me see. The equations we had were:

2x = 2λ(y + z) + μ(yz) → (1)

2y = 2λ(x + z) + μ(xz) → (2)

2z = 2λ(x + y) + μ(xy) → (3)

Let me subtract equation (1) and (2):

2x - 2y = 2λ(y + z -x - z) + μ(yz -xz)

Simplify: 2(x - y) = 2λ(y -x) + μ z(y -x)

Factor out (x - y):

2(x - y) = -2λ(x - y) - μ z (x - y)

Assuming x ≠ y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = -2λ - μ z → 2λ + μ z = -2 → equation (4)

Similarly, subtract equation (2) and (3):

2y -2z = 2λ(x + z -x - y) + μ(xz -xy)

Simplify: 2(y - z) = 2λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y)

Factor out (y - z):

2(y - z) = -2λ(y - z) - μ x (y - z)

Again, assuming y ≠ z, divide both sides by (y - z):

2 = -2λ - μ x → 2λ + μ x = -2 → equation (5)

Similarly, subtract equation (1) and (3):

2x -2z = 2λ(y + z -x - y) + μ(yz -xy)

Simplify: 2(x - z) = 2λ(z -x) + μ y(z -x)

Factor out (x - z):

2(x - z) = -2λ(x - z) - μ y (x - z)

Assuming x ≠ z, divide both sides by (x - z):

2 = -2λ - μ y → 2λ + μ y = -2 → equation (6)

So now, from equations (4), (5), (6):

2λ + μ z = -2 → (4)

2λ + μ x = -2 → (5)

2λ + μ y = -2 → (6)

So, all three expressions equal to -2.

Which implies that μ z = μ x = μ y.

So, either μ = 0, or x = y = z.

Case 1: μ = 0.

If μ = 0, then from equations (4), (5), (6): 2λ = -2 → λ = -1.

Then, from the original equations:

From equation (1): 2x = 2*(-1)(y + z) + 0 → 2x = -2(y + z) → x = -(y + z).

But x, y, z are lengths, so positive. So, x = -(y + z) would imply x is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, μ cannot be zero.

Case 2: x = y = z.

So, the box is a cube. Then, surface area is 6x² =54 → x²=9 → x=3.

Volume is x³=27. But wait, the volume is supposed to be 23. 27≠23, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the box cannot be a cube.

Therefore, our assumption that x, y, z are all equal is invalid.

Therefore, the only possibility is that x, y, z are not all equal, and μ≠0. So, from equations (4), (5), (6), we have:

μ z = μ x = μ y.

Since μ ≠0, then z = x = y.

Wait, but that again leads us to x=y=z, which we saw is impossible because volume would be 27≠23.

Hmm, that suggests a contradiction. So, perhaps our earlier assumption that two variables are equal might not hold, or maybe we need another approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the logic. Let me reevaluate.

When we subtracted the equations, we assumed that x ≠ y and y ≠ z, etc., but perhaps in reality, two variables are equal, leading to the third being different. So, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, not all three.

Which is what I did earlier by assuming x = y. So, perhaps that case is valid, and that would give the minimal r².

Because in the earlier step, when I assumed x=y, I found two possible solutions, one of which gave a lower r².

But let's see. Let me consider that x=y, then equations (4), (5), (6) would require that:

From equation (4): 2λ + μ z = -2

From equation (5): 2λ + μ x = -2

So, since x = y, and x = y, then μ z = μ x → either μ=0 (which we saw isn't possible) or z =x. But if z =x, then all three variables are equal, which is a cube, which isn't possible due to volume.

So, if in the case x=y, but z different, then from equations (4) and (5):

2λ + μ z = 2λ + μ x → μ(z -x)=0. Since μ≠0, z =x. But that's a cube, which is invalid.

So, this suggests that the case x=y leads to a contradiction unless z=x, but that's impossible because of the volume. So, perhaps the minimal doesn't occur when two variables are equal.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach this problem differently.

Alternative approach: let me denote the variables as x, y, z, with xyz=23 and 2(xy + yz +xz)=54.

We need to minimize x² + y² + z².

Perhaps, instead of using Lagrange multipliers, I can express variables in terms of each other.

Let me try to express one variable in terms of the others. Let's say z =23/(xy).

Substituting into the surface area equation: 2(xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy))) =54.

Simplify: 2[xy + 23/x +23/y] =54 → xy +23/x +23/y =27.

Hmm, this equation still looks complicated, but maybe I can set u = x + y and v = xy.

Then, we have:

v +23/x +23/y =27.

But 23/x +23/y =23*(x + y)/(xy) =23u /v.

So, equation becomes:

v + (23 u)/v =27.

Multiply both sides by v: v² +23u =27v.

So, v² -27v +23u=0.

But I also have u =x + y, and I want to express x² + y² + z². Let's compute x² + y² + z².

z=23/(xy)=23/v.

So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy + z² = u² - 2v + (23/v)^2.

So, our objective function is:

f(u, v) = u² - 2v + (529)/(v²)

With the constraint v² -27v +23u=0 → 23u =27v -v² → u=(27v -v²)/23.

So, substitute u into f(u, v):

f(v) = [(27v -v²)/23]^2 - 2v + 529/(v²).

This is a function of v alone. So, to find the minimum, we can take the derivative of f(v) with respect to v, set it to zero, and solve for v.

But this seems quite complicated, but perhaps manageable.

First, let's compute [(27v -v²)/23]^2:

= (27v -v²)^2 / (23²)
= (729v² -54v³ +v^4)/529

So, f(v) = (729v² -54v³ +v^4)/529 -2v +529/(v²)

Let me write all terms over a common denominator, but maybe it's easier to compute the derivative directly.

Let me denote f(v) as:

f(v) = (v^4 -54v³ +729v²)/529 -2v +529v^{-2}

Compute f'(v):

= [ (4v³ -162v² +1458v) /529 ] -2 - (2*529)v^{-3}

Simplify each term:

= (4v³ -162v² +1458v)/529 -2 -1058/v³

Set f'(v)=0:

(4v³ -162v² +1458v)/529 -2 -1058/v³ =0

Multiply both sides by 529 v³ to eliminate denominators:

v³*(4v³ -162v² +1458v) -2*529v³ -1058*529 =0

Wait, no. Let me properly compute:

Multiply each term:

First term: (4v³ -162v² +1458v)/529 * v³ = (4v^6 -162v^5 +1458v^4)/529

Second term: -2 *v³= -2v³

Third term: -1058/v³ *v³= -1058

So, equation becomes:

(4v^6 -162v^5 +1458v^4)/529 -2v³ -1058 =0

Multiply all terms by 529
