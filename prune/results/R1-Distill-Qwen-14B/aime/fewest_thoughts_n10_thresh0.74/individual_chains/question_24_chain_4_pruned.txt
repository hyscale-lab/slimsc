Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's recall what each term means.

- **Sum of the items**: That's straightforward; add up all the numbers and get 30.
- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. "Unique mode is 9" means 9 appears more times than any other number, and no other number shares that highest frequency.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. Since it's a positive integer not in the list, that tells me something about the structure of the list.

Also, all numbers are positive integers, so that's another constraint.

Alright, let's start by considering the mode first. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's think about how many times 9 must appear.

If 9 is the unique mode, it has to appear at least twice because if it appeared only once, it wouldn't be the mode. Wait, actually, if all other numbers appear once, then 9 could be the mode with just one occurrence, but that can't be because the mode is the most frequent. So, if every other number appears once, but 9 appears once, that's not a mode. So, 9 must appear at least twice.

But wait, no, that's not entirely correct. If all numbers appear once except 9, which appears twice, then 9 is the mode. So, 9 has to appear more times than any other number. So, if 9 appears twice, other numbers can appear at most once.

Wait, but the problem says the unique mode is 9. So, if 9 appears more than any other number. Let's say 9 appears k times, then all other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

So, let's figure out possible values for k.

But before that, perhaps we can also think about the median. The median is a positive integer not in the list. So, the median must be a number that is not present in the list.

Wait, the median is the middle value when the list is ordered. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this problem, the median is a positive integer, and it doesn't appear in the list. So, this tells me that the list has even number of elements because if it were odd, the median would be one of the elements, right?

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If the list has an odd number of elements, say n is odd, then the median is the (n+1)/2
