Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem to solve. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The problem says:

There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, okay. So, two logarithmic equations here, both equal to 10. Let me write them down:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but I think I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me recall the definition: log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a.

So applying that to the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = 10 implies that x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 implies that y^10 = x^{4y}.

Alright, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, so we have x and y related through these equations. I need to find xy. Maybe I can find expressions for x and y in terms of each other or find a relation between them.

Let me see. From the first equation, x^10 = y^x. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring the exponents down. Let's try that.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to:

10 ln x = x ln y

Similarly, for the second equation:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which becomes:

10 ln y = 4y ln x

Okay, so now I have:

1. 10 ln x = x ln y
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, so maybe I can express ln y from the first equation and substitute into the second.

From equation 1:

10 ln x = x ln y

So, ln y = (10 ln x) / x

Now, plug this into equation 2:

10 ln y = 4y ln x

Substituting ln y:

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x

Simplify that:

(100 ln x) / x = 4y ln x

Hmm, okay. Let's see, if ln x is not zero, which it can't be because x > 1, so ln x is positive. Therefore, I can divide both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y

So,

100 / x = 4y

Which can be rewritten as:

4y = 100 / x

Or,

y = (100) / (4x) = 25 / x

Got it. So y is 25 divided by x. Now, let's remember that both x and y are greater than 1. So, since y = 25/x, and y > 1, that implies x must be less than 25. Similarly, x >1 implies y =25/x >1, so x must be less than 25. So x is between 1 and 25.

Okay, so now I have y =25/x. Let me plug this back into one of the earlier equations to find x. Let's choose equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Substituting y =25/x:

x^10 = (25/x)^x

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe taking natural logs again would help. Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(x^10) = ln((25/x)^x)

Simplify:

10 ln x = x ln(25/x)

Which is:

10 ln x = x [ ln 25 - ln x ]

So,

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x

Let me bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln 25 = 0

Factor terms:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln 25 = 0

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, meaning it might not have a straightforward algebraic solution. Maybe I can rearrange terms or find a substitution.

Let me factor ln 25 as 2 ln 5, since 25 is 5 squared. So,

ln 25 = 2 ln 5

Therefore, our equation becomes:

ln x (10 + x) - x * 2 ln 5 = 0

Or,

(10 + x) ln x = 2x ln 5

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can write this as:

(10 + x) ln x = 2x ln 5

I can rearrange this as:

(10 + x) ln x = 2x ln 5

Alternatively,

(10/x + 1) ln x = 2 ln 5

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I can try some substitution.

Let me set t = ln x, so x = e^t.

Then, let's rewrite the equation in terms of t.

Original equation:

(10 + x) t = 2x ln5

Substituting x = e^t:

(10 + e^t) t = 2 e^t ln5

Hmm, perhaps dividing both sides by e^t:

(10 e^{-t} + 1) t = 2 ln5

Wait, let's see:

(10 + e^t) t = 2 e^t ln5

Divide both sides by e^t:

t (10 e^{-t} + 1) = 2 ln5

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, maybe think in terms of equation:

(10 + x) ln x = 2x ln5

Let me rearrange it as:

(10 + x) ln x - 2x ln5 = 0

I can try to see if there is an x that satisfies this equation. Maybe try some integer values within the range of x (which is 1 < x <25).

Let me try x=5.

Plug x=5 into the equation:

(10 +5) ln5 - 2*5 ln5 = 15 ln5 - 10 ln5 =5 ln5 ≈5*1.609≈8.045 >0

So, positive.

What about x=10:

(10+10) ln10 -2*10 ln5=20 ln10 -20 ln5=20 (ln10 - ln5)=20 ln(2) ≈20*0.693≈13.86>0

Still positive.

What about x=25:

(10+25) ln25 -2*25 ln5=35 ln25 -50 ln5.

But ln25=2 ln5, so 35*2 ln5=70 ln5, and 50 ln5 subtracted.

70 ln5 -50 ln5=20 ln5 ≈20*1.609≈32.18>0

Still positive.

Wait, but at x approaching 1 from above.

Let me try x=2.

(10+2) ln2 -4 ln5=12 *0.693 -4*1.609≈8.316-6.436≈1.88>0.

Hmm, so it's positive at x=2, 5,10,25. Maybe my approach is wrong. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait a second, perhaps I can write the two original equations in terms of each other.

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}

So, let's substitute y from equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1: y = x^{10/x}

So, plug this into equation 2:

(y)^10 = x^{4y}

Substitute y:

(x^{10/x})^10 =x^{4y}

Simplify left side: x^{100/x}

So,

x^{100/x} = x^{4y}

Since the bases are the same, the ex
