Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me first make sure I understand the setup correctly.

We have a torus T, which is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle. The axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like taking a donut shape where the tube of the donut has a radius of 3, and the center of the tube is 6 units away from the axis of revolution. 

Then, there's a sphere S with radius 11. When the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Conversely, when T rests on the outside of S, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime. Then, compute m + n.

Hmm. Okay, let me think about what internal and external tangency means here.

First, let's model the torus. A torus can be described using the terms R and r, where R is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus (the main distance from the axis to the center of the circle being revolved), and r is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, R is 6, and r is 3.

Wait, no, wait. When you revolve a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from its center, that should make R = 6 and r = 3. So yes, R = 6 and r = 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere S (radius 11), it's tangent to the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle.

Let me try to visualize this. When the torus is placed inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus must touch the sphere at some points. The tangency will occur where the distance from the center of the sphere to the torus is equal to 11. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is smaller, but wait, no, the sphere's radius is fixed at 11. Oh, wait, no. When the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is inside the torus. So the sphere is touching the torus externally.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The torus is always being compared to the sphere S of radius 11. So, when T is on the inside of S, T is inside S and touches it along a circle. When T is on the outside of S, it's enclosing S and touches it externally along another circle.

So, in both cases, the torus is tangent to the sphere S along a circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, respectively, and we're to find their difference.

I think the key here is to find the radius of the circle where the torus and sphere are tangent. For both internal and external cases, we can model this using the geometry of the torus and sphere.

Let me recall that the equation of a torus in 3D can be complex, but maybe we can consider the cross-section or use some geometric properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube.

Wait, but the sphere is fixed, so maybe the sphere is centered at the same point as the torus's axis? That might make sense because otherwise, the setup could vary. So let's assume both the torus and the sphere are centered at the origin.

So, the sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin. The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, with its center at (6, 0, 0) in the xy-plane. Wait, no—if the axis is in the plane of the circle, and the circle is being revolved around an axis in its plane, that axis is perpendicular to the plane of the circle. Hmm, wait.

Wait, no, the torus is formed by rotating a circle in a plane around an axis in the same plane. So, for example, if the circle lies in the xy-plane, and the axis is, say, the z-axis but offset by 6 units in the x-direction. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the axis is in the plane of the circle.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to model the torus in polar coordinates. Let me recall that the standard equation for a torus with tube radius r and distance R from the center of the tube to the center of the torus is given in polar coordinates as:

ρ² = (R cos θ)² + r²

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe using Cartesian coordinates.

Wait another approach: The torus can be described as the set of points where the distance from any point on the torus to the axis of revolution is R + r cos θ, where θ is the angle parameter. So, the maximum distance from the center is R + r, and the minimum is R - r.

Wait, so the torus has inner radius R - r and outer radius R + r.

In this case, R is 6 and r is 3, so the inner radius is 3 and outer radius is 9. Wait, but that seems contradictory because the sphere has a radius of 11.

Wait, if the torus has an outer radius of 9, but the sphere is radius 11, so when the torus is inside the sphere, it's possible. But when the torus is outside, I'm a bit confused because 9 is less than 11, so the sphere can't be inside the torus.

Wait, perhaps I have the R and r reversed. Maybe R is the distance from the center, so in this case, R is 6, and r is 3. So the torus's inner radius is R - r = 3, and outer radius is R + r = 9. So the sphere of radius 11 is larger.

Wait, but when the torus is placed on the outside of the sphere, that would imply that the torus encloses the sphere. But since the torus's outer radius is 9, which is less than 11, that can't be. So I must have misunderstood the setup.

Wait, perhaps R is 6, meaning that the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis, and the radius of the generating circle is 3. So the distance from the axis to the farthest point on the torus is 6 + 3 = 9, and the closest is 6 - 3 = 3. So yes, the torus has inner
