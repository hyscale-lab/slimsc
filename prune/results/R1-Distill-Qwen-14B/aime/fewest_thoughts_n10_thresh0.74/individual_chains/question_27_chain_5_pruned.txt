Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3 units, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, if I imagine spinning that circle around the axis, it forms a donut.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent to it along a circle, which is internally tangent. Alternatively, the torus can rest outside the sphere and be tangent externally along another circle. The radii of these tangent circles are r_i (internal) and r_o (external), and I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out the radii of these tangent circles when the torus is inside and outside the sphere.

First, let me recall the properties of a torus. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this problem, the minor radius is 3, and the major radius is 6.

So, major radius R = 6, minor radius r = 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I think these tangent circles lie on the surface of both the torus and the sphere.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. The torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere's radius is 11. The center of the sphere must coincide with the center of the torus's generating circle, right? Wait, no. Wait, the torus is generated by rotating a circle around an axis, so the center of the generating circle is at a distance R from the axis. But in this case, since the sphere is much larger, maybe the centers are aligned.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus and the sphere in a coordinate system. Let me set up a coordinate system where the axis of the torus is along the z-axis. So the generating circle lies in the x-y plane, centered at (0,0,6), since the major radius is 6. Wait, no. Wait, if the axis is in the plane of the circle, which is in the x-y plane, and the distance from the center to the axis is 6, so the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0), and the axis is the z-axis? Hmm, maybe I should define the coordinates differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the torus as having major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. So, any point on the torus can be represented in coordinates as ( (R + r cos θ) cos φ, (R + r cos θ) sin φ, r sin θ ), where θ and φ are angles parameterizing the torus.

But maybe I can think of the torus as the set of points at a distance r from the center of the generating circle, which itself is moving along a circle of radius R around the axis.

So, the sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside, the sphere's center must be at some point relative to the torus. Wait, perhaps the sphere's center coincides with the center of the torus's generating circle. Let me assume that the center of the sphere is at the same point as the center of the generating circle
