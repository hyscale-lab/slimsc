Okay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers correct, which is a subset of winning a prize (because if she has all four correct, she definitely has at least two correct), then P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we need is P(A)/P(B).

So, first, let's figure out P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Then, we'll find P(B), the probability of winning any prize (at least two numbers correct). Then, we'll divide those two probabilities to get the answer.

Starting with P(A). To win the grand prize, all four of her numbers must be the four chosen. How many possible ways are there to choose four numbers from 10? That's the combination C(10,4). And how many favorable outcomes are there? Only 1, because there's only one set of four numbers that match exactly. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4). Let me compute that.

C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, P(B). This is the probability that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. This can be approached in a few ways. One approach is to compute the probability of having exactly 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers, and add them up. Alternatively, since it's sometimes easier to compute the complement, we can subtract the probabilities of having fewer than 2 correct numbers (i.e., 0 or 1 correct) from 1.

Let me think which method is easier. The problem is that in a conditional probability, sometimes it's easier to calculate directly. But for now, let's try both methods and see if I get the same result.

First, let's compute the total number of possible ways the four numbers can be chosen: C(10,4) = 210, as before.

Now, the number of ways she can have exactly k correct numbers, where k is 2, 3, or 4.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the number of ways she can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers, but since we're interested in at least 2, we'll sum from k=2 to k=4.

Wait, actually, regardless, the number of favorable cases for exactly k correct numbers is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because you choose k numbers from her 4, and then the remaining 4 - k numbers from the other 6 numbers she didn't choose.

Let me confirm that. So, for exactly k correct numbers, you have to choose all k correct ones from her 4, and the remaining 4 - k from the 10 - 4 = 6 incorrect ones. So yes, the number of ways is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).

Therefore, the number of favorable cases for exactly 2 correct numbers is C(4,2)*C(6,2). For exactly 3 correct, it's C(4,3)*C(6,1). For exactly 4 correct, it's C(4,4)*C(6,0).

So, let's compute these:

- Exactly 2 correct: C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. So, 6*15=90.
- Exactly 3 correct: C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.
- Exactly 4 correct: C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1. So, 1*1=1.

Total number of favorable cases for at least 2 correct: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, the probability P(B) is 115 / 210. Let me simplify that. 115 and 210 can both be divided by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

Wait, that seems a bit low, but let's check the alternative approach: calculating the complement.

The probability of having fewer than 2 correct numbers is the probability of having exactly 0 or exactly 1 correct numbers.

Number of ways for exactly 0 correct: all four numbers are from the 6 she didn't choose. So, C(6,4). Which is 15.

Number of ways for exactly 1 correct: C(4,1)*C(6,3). C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20, so 4*20=80.

So, number of ways for fewer than 2 correct: 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways for at least 2 correct is total - fewer than 2: 210 - 95 = 115, which matches the previous result. So, P(B)=115/210=23/42.

So, we have P(A)=1/210 and P(B)=23/42.

Wait, hold on. Wait, in the conditional probability, we have P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B). So, that would be (1/210) / (23/42). Let me compute that.

First, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23).

Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 five
