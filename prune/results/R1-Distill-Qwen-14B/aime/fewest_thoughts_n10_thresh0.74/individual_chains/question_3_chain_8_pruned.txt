Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand it step by step.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The probability of the grand prize given that she won a prize. So, using the formula:

P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize and Prize) / P(Prize)

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, right? Because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So P(Grand Prize and Prize) is just P(Grand Prize). So the formula simplifies to:

P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize)

So I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that she wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize (which includes both exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching). Then, I'll divide them to get the conditional probability.

Let me think about how to compute these probabilities.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S, which has 10 elements. That's the total number of possible outcomes, right? So the total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4), which is 210.

Now, the probability that Jen wins the grand prize is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. That means in the random selection, exactly her four numbers are picked. So the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (just her specific set of four numbers). So P(Grand Prize) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, we need P(Prize), which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, this includes scenarios where exactly 2, 3, or all 4 of her numbers are selected. So we can compute this by summing the probabilities of each of these cases.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the complement probability and subtracting from 1. The complement of winning a prize is not winning any prize, which would be when fewer than two numbers match, i.e., exactly 0 or exactly 1 number matches. So maybe it's easier to compute 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match).

Let me consider both approaches and see which is easier.

First, let's try computing the number of favorable outcomes for at least two matches.

The number of ways to choose exactly k numbers from Jen's 4 numbers and the remaining (4 - k) from the other 6 numbers in S. So for k=2,3,4.

So the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15, so 6*15=90.

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24.

C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1, so 1*1=1.

Total favorable outcomes = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So the number of ways she wins a prize is 115. So P(Prize) = 115 / 210.

Alternatively, let me check using the complement method.

Total number of possible outcomes is 210.

Number of ways to have 0 matches: C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1*15 = 15.

Number of ways to have exactly 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20 = 80.

So total number of ways to
