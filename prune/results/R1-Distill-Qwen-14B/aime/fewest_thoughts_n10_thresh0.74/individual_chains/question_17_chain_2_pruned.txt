Alright, so I've got this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, they want r squared expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and finally p+q. Okay, let me unpack this step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes, each with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. The smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box would have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius r would be half of that diagonal.

So, for any box with dimensions x, y, z, the space diagonal d is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r = d/2, so r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal value of (x² + y² + z²) for boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, r² is that minimal value divided by 4.

So, I need to minimize x² + y² + z² given that the surface area is 54 and volume is 23. Let's write down the constraints.

Surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. So, xy + yz + xz = 27.

Volume is xyz = 23.

We need to minimize x² + y² + z².

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that for such problems, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a way to express this in terms of symmetric functions since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z.

Wait, but the constraints are symmetric as well, so maybe the minimal occurs when x = y = z? But let me check. If x = y = z, then the box is a cube.

But wait, let's see if that's possible. If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, so x = 3. Then volume would be 27, but in our problem, the volume is 23. So, the cube doesn't satisfy the volume constraint here. Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² won't correspond to a cube in this case.

So, maybe to find the minimal, we can express variables in terms of others and then use calculus to minimize.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints.

Let me try that. Let me set up the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27,
h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

So, using Lagrange multipliers with two constraints, the gradients of f should be a linear combination of the gradients of g and h.

So, ∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

Calculating the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z),

∇g = (y + z, x + z, x + y),

∇h = (yz, xz, xy).

So, the equations become:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz),
2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz),
2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy).

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe we can find some symmetry or relations between variables.

Let me assume that two variables are equal, say y = z. Maybe this is the case for the minimal configuration. Let's test that.

Let’s suppose y = z. Then, let's denote y = z = a, and x = b.

So, the surface area becomes 2(ab + ba + a²) = 2(2ab + a²) = 4ab + 2a² = 54.

Volume becomes b * a * a = a² b = 23.

We can write the two equations as:

4ab + 2a² = 54.  --> 2ab + a² = 27.

and a² b = 23.

Let me solve for b from the second equation: b = 23/(a²).

Substitute into the first equation:

2a*(23/(a²)) + a² = 27.

Simplify:

46/a + a² = 27.

Multiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:

46 + a³ = 27a.

Rearranged: a³ -27a +46 = 0.

Hmm, need to solve a³ -27a +46 = 0.

Let me try possible integer roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0.

a=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Oh! a=2 is a root.

So, factor the polynomial. Since a=2 is a root, (a-2) is a factor.

Divide a³ -27a +46 by (a -2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23  0

So, the polynomial factors as (a -2)(a² + 2a -23) = 0.

So, the roots are a=2, and a² +2a -23=0.

Solving a² +2a -23=0, using quadratic formula:

a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] / 2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since a is a length, it must be positive, so a = -1 + 2*sqrt(6).

Wait,
