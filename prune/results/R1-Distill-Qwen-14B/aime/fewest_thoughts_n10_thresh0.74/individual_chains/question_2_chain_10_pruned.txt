Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. Hmm, so we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis, but not as far as (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment starting on the x-axis at some point P(p, 0) and ending on the y-axis at Q(0, q), such that the distance between P and Q is 1. Since they're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

We need to find a point C on AB, not A or B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. Then, we have to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to C, expressed as a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

First, let me visualize this. The segments PQ are all of unit length, going from the x-axis to the y-axis. So, for each p, q satisfies sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which means q = sqrt(1 - p²). So, each PQ is the line segment between (p, 0) and (0, sqrt(1 - p²)).

Now, the family F is all such segments. So, imagine a bunch of line segments from the x-axis to the y-axis, each of length 1, sweeping across the first quadrant.

The point C is on AB, and it's unique in that it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments. Let's check: A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the distance between A and B.

Distance AB is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F. So, AB is one of these PQ segments.

Now, the point C is on AB, but not A or B. And it's not on any other PQ segment from F. So, for this point C, if we consider all other PQ segments in F, C doesn't lie on any of them except AB.

Our goal is to find OC².

So, perhaps we can parametrize AB, then find the point C on AB such that for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

To do this, maybe we can find the equation of AB, then find the point C such that it's the only point on AB that isn't on any other PQ in F.

First, let's parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the parametric equation of AB can be written as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

where t varies from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So, any point C on AB can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, we need to find such a C where, for any other PQ in F (so for any p ≠ 1/2), the point C is not on PQ.

Let me think about this. For C to be on AB and not on any other PQ, it must not satisfy the equation of any other PQ.

Each PQ is the line segment from (p, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)). So, the equation of PQ can be written as:

x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1

Because it's a straight line from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)), so intercept form.

So, for each p, the line is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

Now, our point C is on AB, so it must satisfy both the equation of AB and not satisfy any other line PQ for p ≠ 1/2.

Wait, but C lies on AB, which is one such PQ (for p=1/2). So, for p=1/2, the line is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1, which is 2x + (2y)/sqrt(3) = 1, which is correct for AB.

Now, the problem says that C is on AB but not on any other PQ. So, for all other p, the line PQ (for that p) doesn't pass through C.

So, the point C is such that it is on AB, but not on any other PQ. So, for any other p, the equation x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) ≠ 1 when evaluated at point C.

So, to find C, we can set up that for all p ≠ 1/2, the equation 2x + (2y)/sqrt(3) = 1 (the equation of AB) is satisfied, but the equation x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) ≠ 1.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to find where AB intersects other PQ lines, and find the point C which is only on AB and not on any other PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps think of C as being the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. But in our case, the family F is a set of line segments, not curves. So,
