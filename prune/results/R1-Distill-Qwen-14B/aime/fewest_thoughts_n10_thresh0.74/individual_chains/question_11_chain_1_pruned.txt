Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. It says:

Find the largest possible real part of \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4.

Hmm, alright. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I know that z is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, |z| = 4. That means z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4.

The expression given is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. I need to find the maximum real part of this expression. So, I'm looking for the maximum value of Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z].

I think it might help to write z in its polar form. Since |z| = 4, I can write z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, z can also be written as 4(cosθ + i sinθ).

But maybe another approach is better. Let me consider z as a complex number a + ib, but since |z| = 4, we have a² + b² = 16. But that might complicate things with two variables. Perhaps polar form is better.

Wait, another idea: Let me denote w = z. Then, since |z| = 4, 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|². So, 1/z = \overline{z}/16, because |z|² is 16.

So, the expression becomes (75 + 117i)w + (96 + 144i)(\overline{w}/16).

Hmm, that simplifies to:

(75 + 117i)w + (96 + 144i)/16 * \overline{w}.

Calculating (96 + 144i)/16: 96/16 = 6, 144/16 = 9. So, 6 + 9i.

So, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)w + (6 + 9i)\overline{w}.

So, the expression is (75 + 117i)w + (6 + 9i)\overline{w}.

Let me write w as a complex number in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let w = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers, and x² + y² = 16.

Then, \overline{w} = x - iy.

So, substituting into the expression:

(75 + 117i)(x + iy) + (6 + 9i)(x - iy).

Let me compute each part.

First, compute (75 + 117i)(x + iy):

Multiply them out:

75x + 75iy + 117i x + 117i^2 y.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

75x + 75iy + 117i x - 117 y.

Group real and imaginary parts:

(75x - 117y) + i(75y + 117x).

Similarly, compute (6 + 9i)(x - iy):

Multiply them out:

6x - 6iy + 9i x - 9i^2 y.

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

6x - 6iy + 9i x + 9y.

Group real and imaginary parts:

(6x + 9y) + i(-6y + 9x).

Now, add the two results together:

Real parts:

(75x - 117y) + (6x + 9y) = (75x + 6x) + (-117y + 9y) = 81x - 108y.

Imaginary parts:

(75y + 117x) + (-6y + 9x) = (117x + 9x) + (75y - 6y) = 126x + 69y.

So, the entire expression is (81x - 108y) + i(126x + 69y).

But we are interested in the real part of this expression, which is 81x - 108y.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing 81x - 108y, given that x² + y² = 16.

Hmm, that seems manageable. So, the real part is 81x - 108y, and we need to maximize this under the constraint x² + y² = 16.

I remember that to maximize a linear expression like ax + by with a constraint x² + y² = r², we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or recognize it as the dot product of vectors.

Indeed, the maximum of ax + by is equal to the magnitude of the vector (a, b) multiplied by the magnitude of (x, y) and the cosine of the angle between them. Since (x, y) has magnitude 4, the maximum value is |(a, b)| * 4.

Wait, let me think again. So, ax + by is the dot product of (a, b) and (x, y). The dot product is |a||x| cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. So, the maximum occurs when (x, y) is in the same direction as (a, b
