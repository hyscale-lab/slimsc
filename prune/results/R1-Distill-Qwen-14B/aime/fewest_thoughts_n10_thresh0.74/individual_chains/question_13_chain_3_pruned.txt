Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks and her coffee shop stops. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and then stops at a coffee shop. The key here is that the total time she spends walking and being in the coffee shop is given for two different walking speeds. From this, I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Let's parse the problem again. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, so does that mean her total time is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee stop? I think so. So, the walking time plus the coffee time equals 4 hours.

Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, again including t minutes in the coffee shop.

So, the first thing I notice is that the coffee shop time t is constant in both scenarios. That must mean that the time she spends walking changes when her speed changes, but the coffee time stays the same.

Since the distance she walks is the same both times, 9 km, I can set up some equations based on the formula: time = distance / speed.

Let me denote the walking time without the coffee stop as Tw1 when her speed is s, and Tw2 when her speed is s + 2. The total time including coffee would then be Tw1 + t and Tw2 + t.

From the first scenario:
Total time = 4 hours = Tw1 + t
But Tw1 = distance / speed = 9 / s
So, 9/s + t = 4  ...(1)

From the second scenario:
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Wait, 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total is 2.4 hours.
So, 2.4 = Tw2 + t
Tw2 = 9 / (s + 2)
So, 9/(s + 2) + t = 2.4  ...(2)

Now, I have two equations:
1. 9/s + t = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t = 2.4

I can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate t.

So, (9/s + t) - (9/(s + 2) + t) = 4 - 2.4
Which simplifies to 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute this:
Compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6
Factor out the 9: 9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the difference in the brackets:
1/s - 1/(s + 2) = (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) )= 2/(s(s + 2))

So, 9 * (2)/(s(s + 2)) )= 1.6

Which is 18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6

Now, let's solve for s.

18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6
Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):
18 = 1.6 s (s + 2)

Let me write it as:
1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals could be tricky. Maybe I can eliminate them by multiplying both sides by 10 to make it integer coefficients:
16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait,
