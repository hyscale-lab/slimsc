Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I know that for a prime p, if p divides n⁴ +1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That suggests that the order of n modulo p divides 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be less than 8, right? So, the multiplicative order of n modulo p is 8, which means that 8 divides p-1 because the order must divide p-1 (by Fermat's little theorem). So, p ≡ 1 mod 8. But wait, is that necessarily true? Because if the order is 8, then 8 divides p-1, so p ≡ 1 mod 8.

But wait, I'm looking for primes where p² divides n⁴ +1. So, it's not just that p divides n⁴ +1, but p² does as well. So, maybe I need to consider primes where p² divides n⁴ +1. Maybe such primes are called Wieferich primes or something? I'm not exactly sure, but I think Wieferich primes are primes p such that p² divides 2^{p-1} -1, which is a different condition. So, maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider primes where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, let's think about primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². Or, more specifically, primes where the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution.

Given that, I should probably check small primes first and see if any of them satisfy the condition that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.

Starting with p=2. Let's see: n⁴ +1 mod 4
