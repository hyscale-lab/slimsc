Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. It says that AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all the faces, and I need to find that distance in a specific form and then compute m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think I need the volume of the tetrahedron and the sum of the areas of its faces. The formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area.

Wait, let me make sure. For a tetrahedron, the inradius is given by r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. So, yeah, that's correct. So first, I need to find the volume V and then the total surface area A.

But to compute V, I might need the coordinates of the vertices. Maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices in a way that simplifies calculations. Since the edge lengths are symmetric, perhaps I can position the tetrahedron in a coordinate system where some vertices are at symmetric points.

Let me try to assign coordinates. Let's suppose vertex A is at (x, y, z), vertex B at (a, b, c), etc. But maybe it's better to choose coordinates such that certain points are at symmetric positions. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the property that in such a tetrahedron, opposite edges are equal. Wait, AB=CD, AC=BD, and BC=AD. So, this might be a kind of isosceles tetrahedron, also known as a disphenoid.

Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, it's a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces? Wait, no, actually, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent, but in this case, the edges are equal in opposite pairs, so maybe it's a disphenoid.

In a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, and the faces are congruent triangles. So, in this case, each pair of opposite edges is equal, so each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), right? Let me check: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89.

So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, is that true? Let's see:

For example, face ABC has edges AB=√41, AC=√80, and BC=√89. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB=√41, AD=√89, and BD=√80. So, yes, all faces are congruent triangles. So, it's a disphenoid.

That's useful because in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using a specific formula.

I remember that for a disphenoid, if you know the lengths of the edges, there's a formula for the volume. Alternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe we can find the volume another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given by edge lengths is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is a determinant of a 5x5 matrix, but in this case, since it's a disphenoid, maybe the determinant simplifies.

Wait, let me recall the formula. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

CM = | 0   1    1    1    1  |
     | 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
     | 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
     | 1
