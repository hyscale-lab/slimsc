Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, so essentially, I need to find the infimum of BD squared, or maybe the minimum value BD can take, but the question says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So that would be the infimum, the greatest lower bound.

First, let's recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's right. So the diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other. So since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Given
