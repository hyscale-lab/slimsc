Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, and D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me check my notes.

Oh, right! In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, that's a square. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that means that the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees.

Given that, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. The hyperbola is centered at the origin because the equation is x²/20 -
