Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me think. So, each vertex is independently colored red or blue. That means there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings in total. Each coloring is equally likely, so the probability will be the number of favorable colorings divided by 256.

Now, the key part is figuring out how many colorings allow the octagon to be rotated so that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red ones. 

Wait, so a rotation that does this would mean that the set of blue vertices is exactly the image of the set of red vertices under some rotation. So, in other words, the blue vertices are a rotated version of the red vertices. That makes sense.

Since it's a regular octagon, it has rotational symmetry of order 8. That means there are 8 possible rotations: 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째. Each rotation can be represented by an element of the cyclic group C8.

So, for each coloring, we need to check if there exists a rotation such that when we apply it, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. Another way to put this is that the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's the octagon that is rotated, so the positions are rotated, and the colors move with them. So, for a given coloring, if I rotate the octagon by some k positions (where k is from 0 to 7), then the new positions of the blue vertices should all have been red in the original coloring.

So, the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Therefore, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets S of the octagon's vertices such that S is a rotation of its complement.

Hmm, because if S is the set of blue vertices, then its complement is the set of red vertices. So, we need S to be a rotation of its complement.

So, for each coloring
