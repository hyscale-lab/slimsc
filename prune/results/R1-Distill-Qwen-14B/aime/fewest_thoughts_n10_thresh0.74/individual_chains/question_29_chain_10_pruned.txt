Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me visualize this. So, two rectangles. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are on the same line, which I'll call line l. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which probably means they are concyclic or lie on the same circumference.

Given BC=16, which in rectangle ABCD would be the same as AD because opposite sides are equal. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths. So BC=16, AB=107. So the rectangle ABCD has sides 107 and 16.

Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle. FG=17, EF=184. So sides EF and GH are 184, and FG and EH are 17.

Now, since D, E, C, F are collinear, they lie on a straight line. Let me try drawing this out mentally. Let's assume line l is horizontal for simplicity. So from left to right, the points are D, E, C, F. So E is between D and C, and C is between E and F.

Wait, but rectangles ABCD and EFGH are placed such that D, E, C, F are on a line. So perhaps rectangle ABCD is above or below line l, and EFGH is on the same line. Hmm, maybe they are adjacent somehow.

Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. Since A, D, H, G are points of the two rectangles, let's think about their positions.

Let me try to sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Let's say rectangle ABCD has points labeled clockwise: A at the top-left, B at the top-right, C at the bottom-right, D at the bottom-left. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle, and points D, E, C, F are on a straight line. So perhaps E is next to D on that line, and F is next to C on that line.

Wait, if D, E, C, F are collinear, then the order might be D-E-F-C if the line goes from D to E to F to C. Or another order, but this is just an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe D and C are at the ends,
