Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes that each have a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then I have to find p + q.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, for a rectangular box, the surface area is 54, and the volume is 23. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius would be half of that space diagonal. Therefore, the smallest sphere's radius squared would be (space diagonal / 2)^2.

So, my goal is to maximize the space diagonal of such boxes because the sphere has to contain all possible boxes in B, so the maximum space diagonal will determine the radius. Therefore, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal for boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.

Let me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. Then, the surface area S is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume V is xyz = 23. The space diagonal D is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). So, I need to maximize D given S and V constraints.

I think I can use Lagrange multipliers for this optimization problem with two constraints. But maybe there's a smarter way without calculus? Let me think.

Wait, maybe I can express x^2 + y^2 + z^2 in terms of the surface area and volume. Let me recall that (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2S.

But I don't know x + y + z. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can relate this using some inequality.

I remember that for positive real numbers, the AM-QM inequality applies. But I'm not sure how to apply that here. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote:

We need to maximize f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2

Subject to the constraints:
g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0
h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0

So, the Lagrangian is:

L = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0
∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2
