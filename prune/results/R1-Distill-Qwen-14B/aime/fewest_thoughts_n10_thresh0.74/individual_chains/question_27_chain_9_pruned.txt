Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. I need to find the difference between two tangent circles when the torus is inside and outside the sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in its plane, and this axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, imagine taking a donut shape where the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3. That makes sense.

The sphere S has a radius of 11. Now, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. And when it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I should start by recalling the properties of a torus. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. So in this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3.

Next, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. I think this means that the innermost point of the torus touches the sphere, and this happens along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the outermost point touches the sphere along another circle.

Wait, actually, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere at the inner side, and when it's outside, it's touching at the outer side. That must mean that the point of tangency is on the surface of the sphere.

Let me try to model this. The sphere S has a radius of 11, so its center is at some point, say the origin. The torus T is centered at the origin as well, I assume, since we're talking about tangent circles.

Wait, but when it's inside, the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, so maybe their centers are aligned. So the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is zero. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the torus is such that its major circle is centered at the origin, and the sphere is also centered at the origin.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the inner part of the torus touches the sphere. The point of tangency would be the closest point from the sphere's center to the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the farthest point from the sphere's center is tangent to the sphere.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the distance from the origin to a point on the torus. Let me recall the parametric equations of a torus. A torus can be parameterized as:

x = (R + r cosθ) cosφ
y = (R + r cosθ) sinφ
z = r sinθ

where θ and φ are angles, R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius
