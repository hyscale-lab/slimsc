Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. The problem says the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the torus has two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. So in this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest either inside or outside of this sphere. When it's inside, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The question is asking for the difference r_i - r_o, which will be a fraction m/n, and we need to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find r_i and r_o. Let me think about how the torus can be tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases.

First, let's recall the general equation of a torus. The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is ((sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2) = r^2. But since the sphere is also centered at the origin, I think, because otherwise the problem wouldn't specify, but I need to assume that both are centered at the same point for tangency along a circle.

Wait, no, actually, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. So maybe the sphere and the torus share a common center. Let me clarify. If the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, and the torus is entirely inside except for the tangent circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is smaller, but wait, that might not make sense. Wait, the sphere has a fixed radius of 11, and the torus is either inside or outside.

Wait, actually, when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's tangent to the sphere internally along a circle. So the sphere is larger, and the torus is inside, touching the sphere along a circle. When it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle, meaning the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along a circle.

Wait, but the torus has a hole in the middle, so when the sphere is inside the torus, it can only touch the outer part of the torus. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the torus is a surface, so it doesn't enclose a solid volume. So actually, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, and the torus is inside, touching the
