Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have two real numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. We need to find the product xy.

Hmm, okay, I remember some logarithm rules, so maybe I can rewrite these equations using those. Let's write down what's given.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

I think there's a logarithm property that says log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that here, it should become x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, let me make sure I have that right. Yeah, log_x(y^x) is indeed x multiplied by log_x(y). So that equation simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same property, that would be 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10

2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I need to find x and y such that both these equations are satisfied. Let me see if I can relate these equations somehow.

I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A for simplicity. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So, substituting into the equations:

1) x * A = 10

2) 4y * (1/A) = 10

So now I have:

Equation 1: xA = 10

Equation 2: (4y)/A = 10

Hmm, maybe I can solve for x and y in terms of A.

From equation 1: x = 10 / A

From equation 2: 4y = 10A => y = (10A) / 4 = (5A)/2

So, x is 10/A and y is (5A)/2.

But I also know that A is log_x(y). Let me write that down.

A = log_x(y) = log_x( (5A)/2 )

Wait, so A is the logarithm of (5A)/2 with base x, which is 10/A.

So, A = log_{10/A} (5A/2)

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can convert this logarithmic equation into exponential form.

Recall that log_b(c) = d is equivalent to b^d = c.

So, in this case, (10/A)^A = 5A/2.

So, (10/A)^A = (5A)/2.

Hmm, this looks a bit tricky. Let me write that out:

(10/A)^A = (5A)/2.

I need to solve for A here. Maybe take natural logarithms on both sides to simplify.

Taking ln of both sides:

A * ln(10/A) = ln(5A/2)

Let me expand that:

A * [ln(10) - ln(A)] = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Wait, let me see:

ln(10/A) is ln(10) - ln(A), right? And ln(5A/2) is ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

So the equation becomes:

A [ln(10) - ln(A)] = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Hmm, this looks messy, but maybe I can rearrange terms.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) - ln(5) - ln(A) + ln(2) = 0

Combine like terms:

A ln(10) - (A ln(A) + ln(A)) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Factor ln(A) from the middle terms:

A ln(10) - ln(A)(A + 1) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe let's plug in some numbers for A to see if we can find a solution. Let's think about possible integer values for A.

Wait, is there a chance that A is an integer? Let's test A=2.

If A=2:

Left side: (10/2)^2 = 5^2 =25

Right side: (5*2)/2 =5

25 vs 5? Not equal.

A=1:

Left: (10/1)^1=10

Right: (5*1)/2=2.5

Not equal.

A=3:

Left: (10/3)^3 ≈ (3.333)^3 ≈37.037

Right: (5*3)/2=7.5

Nope.

A=4:

Left: (10/4)^4=(2.5)^4≈39.0625

Right: (5*4)/2=10

Not equal.

A=5:

Left: (10/5)^5=2^5=32

Right: (5*5)/2=12.5

Nope.

Hmm, maybe fractional A?

Wait, trying A=1. Let's think differently. Maybe if A is equal to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter substitution or relationship.

Wait, we had x =10/A and y=5A/2.

We can express x and y in terms of A and maybe find another equation.

But perhaps instead, let's consider the fact that x and y are related through A, so maybe we can find another equation involving x and y.

Wait, actually, from the original definitions:

log_x(y) = A => y = x^A

Similarly, log_y(x) = 1/A.

So, if y = x^A, then in the second equation:

log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Wait, let me write that as 4y * log_y(x) =10.

But we have log_y(x)=1/A, so 4y/(A) =10.

Which is the same as before, leading to y = (10A)/4.

Wait, but we also have y =x^A.

So, substituting x=10/A into y=x^A gives:

y=(10/A)^A.

But we also have y=(10A)/4.

So, (10/A)^A = (10A)/4.

Which is the same equation as before.

So, we can write (10/A)^A = (10A)/4.

Hmm, perhaps I can take natural logs again and see if that helps.

So, A ln(10/A) = ln(10A/4)

Which is:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) = ln(10) + ln(A) - ln(4)

Bring all terms to left:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) - ln(10) - ln(A) + ln(4) =0

Factor terms:

(A -1) ln(10) - (A +1) ln(A) + ln(4) =0

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation and might not have an algebraic solution. So perhaps we can find A numerically.

Wait, but maybe we can make a substitution here. Let me denote t = ln(A). Then, A = e^t.

Substituting into the equation:

(A -1) ln(10) - (A +1
