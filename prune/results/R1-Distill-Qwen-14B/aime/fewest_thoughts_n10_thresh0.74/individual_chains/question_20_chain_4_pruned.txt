Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're all indistinguishable. We need to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid. The conditions are:

1. Each cell can contain at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

And we need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, each row and each column must have chips of a single color. So, for each row, we decide whether it's all white or all black, but wait, no—because each cell can have at most one chip. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each cell can have at most one chip, but the condition is that all chips in the same row are the same color. So, if I have a row, say, with some white and some black chips, that would violate the condition. So actually, each row can have chips of only one color, and similarly for each column.

Wait, no, that's not quite right either. The condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color, but if a row has no chips, that's fine, right? So, each row can either be all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But wait, because the grid is 5x5, each column can also be all white, all black, or empty.

But wait, there's another condition. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. That means the configuration is maximal—meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column color conditions. So, that probably means that for every empty cell, either its row or its column is already filled with chips of the opposite color. Otherwise, you could add a chip there without violating the conditions.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If I have a cell that's empty, and its row is not all white or all black, but wait, no. The row can either be all white, all black, or have no chips
