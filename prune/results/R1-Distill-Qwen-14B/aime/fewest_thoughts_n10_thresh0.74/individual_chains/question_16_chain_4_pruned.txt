Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay.

Let me start by understanding the problem better. So, I'm looking for primes p where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. The first such prime is the least prime, so I need to find the smallest prime p for which this is possible. Once I find that p, I then have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes for which there exists an integer n such that n² ≡ -1 mod p must satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, I think that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. So, primes like 5, 13, 17, etc., would satisfy that condition because they are 1 mod 4. But in this problem, it's about n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², not mod p. So, maybe the conditions are a bit different.

Wait, n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Let me recall Hensel's lemma, which is about lifting solutions from mod p to mod p². If p is an odd prime, and if n is a solution to n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, and if the derivative of the function f(n) = n⁴ +1 at n is not congruent to 0 mod p, then there's a unique lift of n to a solution mod p².

The derivative f'(n) = 4n³. So, for Hensel's lemma to apply, we need that 4n³ ≡ 0 mod p? Wait, no, Hensel's lemma requires that f'(n) not be congruent to 0 mod p, right? Because if f'(n) ≡ 0 mod p, the lemma doesn't apply, and there might be multiple or no solutions lifting from mod p to mod p².

So, for primes where -1 is a quartic residue mod p², we can have solutions. But first, I need to find primes p where such an n exists. So, let me start checking small primes to see which is the least such prime.

Let me list small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

I should check p=2 first. Let's see: n⁴ +1 mod 4. For n=1: 1+1=2, which mod 4 is 2, not 0. n=2: 16 +1=17 mod 4 is 1. n=3: 81 +1=82 mod 4 is 2. So, 2 doesn't work because n⁴ +1 is never 0 mod 4. Maybe p=2 is out.

Next, p=3: Let's see if there's n with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1 to 8:

n=1: 1 mod9=1
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: 256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, so 256-252=4 → 4
n=5: 625 mod9: 625-70*9=625-630= -5 →4 (since 625=69*9 +4)
Wait, no, 625
