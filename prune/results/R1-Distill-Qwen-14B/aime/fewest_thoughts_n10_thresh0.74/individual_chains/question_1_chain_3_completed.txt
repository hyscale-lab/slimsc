Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
This means 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, sqrt(2) = x / (y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)  --> (1a)

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
So, 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)  --> (2a)

Third equation:
log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4
Which means 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)  --> (3a)

Now, I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) that relate x, y, z. My goal is to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me denote that expression as E for simplicity.

E = log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of logarithms. Let me define:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

So, E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Now, I need to find a, b, c.

Looking back at the three original equations, let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation (1a, 2a, 3a) because logarithms can help linearize the multiplicative relationships.

Starting with equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)
Taking log₂ of both sides:
log₂ x = log₂ (y z sqrt(2)) = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2)
Which simplifies to:
a = b + c + (1/2)   --> because log₂ sqrt(2) is log₂ 2^(1/2) = 1/2

Similarly, equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)
Taking log₂:
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + log₂ 2^(1/3)
Which simplifies to:
b = a + c + (1/3)

Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)
Taking log₂:
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + log₂ 2^(1/4)
Which simplifies to:
c = a + b + (1/4)

So now I have a system of three equations with a, b, c:
1. a = b + c + 1/2   --> Equation (1b)
2. b = a + c + 1/3   --> Equation (2b)
3. c = a + b + 1/4   --> Equation (3b)

Hmm, this is a linear system. Let me write them down clearly:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

I can try to solve for a, b, c using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2 --> Let's substitute a in equations (2b) and (3b).

Substituting a into equation (2b):
b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
Simplify:
b = b + c + 1/2 + c + 1/3
b = b + 2c + 5/6  (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6)

Subtract b from both sides:
0 = 2c + 5/6
So, 2c = -5/6
c = -5/12

Wait, c is log₂ z, and since z is a positive real number, c can be negative. That's fine.

Now, from equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
We can write a = b + (-5/12) + 1/2
Which is a = b - 5/12 + 6/12 = b + 1/12

So, a = b + 1/12 --> Equation (4)

Now, let's substitute a into equation (3b):
c = a + b + 1/4
We know c = -5/12, so:
-5/12 = a + b + 1/4

But from equation (4), a = b + 1/12. Substitute that into this equation:
-5/12 = (b + 1/12) + b + 1/4
Simplify:
-5/12 = 2b + 1/12 + 3/12 (since 1/4 is 3/12)
-5/12 = 2b + 4/12

Subtract 4/12 from both sides:
-5/12 - 4/12 = 2b
-9/12 = 2b
Simplify -9/12 to -3/4:
-3/4 = 2b
So, b = (-3/4) / 2 = -3/8

Now, from equation (4): a = b + 1/12 = (-3/8) + 1/12
Let me compute that. The common denominator is 24.

-3/8 = -9/24
1/12 = 2/24
So, a = (-9/24) + (2/24) = (-7)/24

So, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12

Let me check these values in the original equations (1b), (2b), (3b).

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
RHS: (-3/8) + (-5/12) + 1/2
Convert to 24 denominators:
-3/8 = -9/24
-5/12 = -10/24
1/2 = 12/24
So, sum: (-9 -10 +12)/24 = (-7)/24, which equals a. Correct.

Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
RHS: (-7/24) + (-5/12) + 1/3
Convert to 24 denominators:
-7/24
-5/12 = -10/24
1/3 = 8/24
Sum: (-7 -10 +8)/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8, which equals b. Correct.

Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4
RHS: (-7/24) + (-3/8) + 1/4
Convert to 24 denominators:
-7/24
-3/8 = -9/24
1/4 = 6/24
Sum: (-7 -9 +6)/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12, which equals c. Correct.

So, the values are consistent.

Now, going back to E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Plugging in the values:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6

3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8

2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

So, E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Let me add these fractions. Let me find a common denominator, which is 24.

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

So, E = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify -75/24. Let's see if it can be reduced. 75 and 24 are both divisible by 3.

75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8. So, -75/24 = -25/8

So E = -25/8

But the problem asks for the absolute value of E, so |E| = | -25/8 | =25/8

25 and 8 are coprime, since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, no common factors.

So, m =25, n=8, m +n=33.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake when adding up the fractions.

E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6) = (-7/6 -5/6) -9/8 = (-12/6) -9/8 = (-2) -9/8 = (-16/8 -9/8) = (-25/8). So that's correct.

So the absolute value is 25/8, m +n=25+8=33.


The given system of logarithmic equations can be rewritten in exponential form and transformed into a linear system of equations. Solving this system yields the values of the logarithms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Substituting these into the expression for \(E\) and simplifying gives the absolute value as \(\frac{25}{8}\). Therefore, \(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\).

\boxed{33}
