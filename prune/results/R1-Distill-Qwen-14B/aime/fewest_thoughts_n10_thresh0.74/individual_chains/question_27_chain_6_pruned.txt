Okay, so I have this math problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus T is created by revolving that circle.

Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Similarly, when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what it means for the torus to be tangent to the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, their surfaces touch along a circle. The same goes for when it's outside.

First, I should probably figure out the main dimensions of the torus. I remember that a torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, R is 6, and r is 3. So, the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11, so the sphere is larger. The torus must fit inside the sphere such that the closest point on the torus is just touching the sphere. Wait, no, actually, when it's internally tangent, the torus is inside the sphere, and they touch along a circle. Similarly, when it's externally tangent, the torus is outside the sphere, touching along another circle.

I think I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency—r_i and r_o—and then compute their difference.

To do this, maybe I can model the torus and the sphere in 3D space and find where they intersect.

But perhaps there's a simpler way. Let me think about cross-sections or something.

Wait, maybe using the geometry of the torus and sphere. Let's consider the centers. The sphere is centered at some point, let's say the origin for simplicity. The torus, when tangent to the sphere, must be such that the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center (the center of the generating circle) is such that the torus just touches the sphere.

Wait, more precisely, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center (which is the center of the generating circle) would be equal to the sphere's radius minus the maximum distance from that center to a point
