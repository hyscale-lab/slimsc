Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. It sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem, probably involving something called the "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Since Alice goes first, we want to find positions where Bob can always win, which would be when the starting position is a losing position for Alice. So, I need to figure out for which n, n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), making it a winning position for the second player (Bob).

Let me try to model this. Maybe I can use dynamic programming or recursion to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. Let's define two sets: W for winning positions and L for losing positions.

The base case is when n=0. If there are no tokens left, the player who just moved wins. So, for n=0, the game is over, and the player who took the last token wins. So, if it's your turn and n=0, you lose because there are no tokens to take. So, n=0 is a losing position.

Now, for n=1, the player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position.

Similarly, for n=2, the player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who then can take the last one and win. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if I take 1 from n=2, leaving n=1, then the opponent can take that 1 and win. So, maybe I should consider other moves. But wait, the only moves are 1 or 4. So, for n=2, you can only take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent.

So, if n=1 is a winning position, then n=2 is a losing position because the opponent can win. Wait, that logic might not be correct.
