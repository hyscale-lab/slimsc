Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid has 8 squares on each side, so moving from the lower left to the upper right requires 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. 

The problem says the paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out how many such paths there are.

First, I remember that in grid path problems, without any restrictions, the number of paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8), since you choose 8 steps right (or up) out of 16 total steps. But here, we have a restriction on the number of direction changes. 

So, what exactly is a direction change here? I think a direction change happens when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. For example, if a path is moving right, right, right, then up, up, that's one direction change after the third step. If it then changes back to right, that's another direction change, and so on.

The problem states that the path changes direction exactly four times. So, how does that affect the structure of the path?

Well, each time the path changes direction, it's starting a new "run" in the opposite direction. So, if the path starts by moving right, the first direction change would be to start moving up, the second would be back to right, and so on. Each direction change increases the number of runs by one.

Wait, so if the path changes direction exactly four times, how many runs does that correspond to? Let's think. If you start moving right, then change direction once to up, that's two runs. Changing direction again to right would be three runs, and so on. So, four direction changes mean five runs in total. Because each direction change adds a new run, starting from the first run.

So, for example, the path would have five segments: maybe right, up, right, up, right, or some permutation of that. Alternatively, it could start with up, but since we're moving from lower left to upper right, the first step could be either right or up. Wait, no, wait, actually in an 8x8 grid, the starting point is (0,0) and we need to get to (8,8). So the first step could be either right or up, but in the problem statement, the examples are shown, but since I don't have the examples, I need to make an assumption.

Wait, perhaps it's a standard grid where you can only move right or up, so each step is either right or up. So starting at (0,0), the first step can be right to (1,0) or up to (0,1). So the path can start either way.

But regardless, the number of runs would be five, with four direction changes. So, each run is a consecutive sequence of steps in one direction. So, for the path to have four direction changes, it must consist of five runs, alternating between right and up.

Now, the key is to count how many such paths there are, considering the starting direction and the lengths of each run.

Each run alternates between right and up. So, if the path starts with a right run, the runs will be R, U, R, U, R. Alternatively, if it starts with up, it will be U, R, U, R, U. So, in both cases, there are five runs, and four direction changes.

Wait, but in both cases, the number of runs alternates between right and up. So, the number of runs in each direction depends on whether the path starts with right or up.

In the first case, starting with right, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. That's three right runs and two up runs. In the second case, starting with up, the runs are U, R, U, R, U. That's three up runs and two right runs.

So, for each case, the number of right and up runs are either (3,2) or (2,3), depending on the starting direction.

But since the grid is 8x8, each path must consist of exactly 8 right steps and 8 up steps. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the right runs must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of the up runs must be 8.

So, for the case where the path starts with right, there are three right runs and two up runs. Each right run must have at least 1 step, and each up run must have at least 1 step. So, the lengths of the right runs must add up to 8, with three parts, each at least 1.
