Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, this sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that for a prime p, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That might come into play with orders or something. Wait, but since we need p² to divide n⁴ +1, that suggests that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I also recall that if p is an odd prime, and p divides n² +1, then p ≡ 1 mod 4. But here, it's n⁴ +1, so maybe similar conditions apply but with higher exponents. Let me think about what primes satisfy that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p² must satisfy certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe I should try small primes and see if any satisfy the condition.

Let me list the small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let's check each one to see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

Starting with p=2. Let's see: n⁴ +1 for n=1 is 2, which is 2²=4? No, 2 isn't divisible by 4. For n=2: 16 +1=17, which is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe p=2 is a candidate? Let me think.

Wait, p=2: n⁴ +1. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4. When n is even, say n=2k, then n⁴=16k⁴≡0 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod 4, which isn't 0. If n is odd, n=2k+1, then n⁴ = (2k+1)^4. Let's compute modulo 4: (1)^4=1 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 ≡ 2 mod 4. So for p=2, n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2 mod 4, so p²=4 never divides n⁴ +1. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's see if there's an n where 3²=9 divides n⁴ +1. So n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod9 for n from 1 to 8.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9. 1 ≡1. Not -1=8.

n=2: 16 mod9=7. 7 ≠8.

n=3: 81 mod9=0. 0 !=8.

n=4: 4⁴=256 mod9. Let's compute 256/9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4≠8.

n=5: 5⁴=625. 625/9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 625 mod9=4. 4≠8.

n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod9=0. 0≠8.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, which mod9 is 7. So 7≠8.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, then 1+9=10, 1+0=1. So 4096 mod9=1. Not 8.

So none of these n from 1 to8 give n⁴ ≡8 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work.

Next, p=5. Let's check if 5²=25 divides n⁴ +1.

So n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to24 (since modulo25, n can go up to24).

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's first find n where n² ≡ something mod5, because n⁴ is (n²)².

Wait, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod5 would require that n⁴ ≡4 mod5 because -1 mod5 is4. Wait, 5: So what's n⁴ mod5?

But n⁴ mod5 can be: Let's compute for n=1:1, n=2: 16 mod5=1, n=3:81 mod5=1, n=4:256 mod5=1, n=5:0, etc.

Wait, n⁴ mod5 is always 0 or 1. So n⁴ ≡4 mod5 is impossible. Therefore, n⁴ ≡-1 mod5 is impossible. So p=5 cannot have n⁴ +1 divisible by5², because even mod5, it's not possible.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if n⁴ +1 is divisible by25, then it's also divisible by5, so n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod5. Which implies n⁴ ≡ -1 mod5, which as above, is impossible because n⁴ mod5 is 0 or1.

So p=5 is out.

Next, p=7.

So check if there's an n where n⁴ ≡-1 mod49.

Let me first check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod7 is possible.

Since if n⁴ ≡-1 mod49, it should also hold mod7.

So let's see, n⁴ mod7.

Possible residues mod7: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Compute n^4 mod7.

n=1:1, 1⁴=1.

n=2:16 mod7=2.

n=3:81 mod7=81-7*11=81-77=4.

n=4:256 mod7. Let's compute 4^4=256. 7*36=252, 256-252=4. So 4.

n=5:625 mod7. 7*89=623, 625-623=2.

n=6:1296 mod7. 7*185=1295, 1296-1295=1.

So n⁴ mod7 can be 0,1,2,4.

So n⁴ ≡-1 mod7 would require n⁴ ≡6 mod7, which doesn't happen because n⁴ mod7 is only 0,1,2,4. So p=7 is also out. Because even mod7, n⁴ +1 can't be 0. So n⁴ +1 is never divisible by7, let alone49.

Moving on to p=13. Wait, hold on, maybe I should check all primes in order. Next after 7 is 11, then 13.

Wait, let me check p=17. Wait, no, let me go in order. After 7 is 11.

p=11.

First, check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod11 is possible.

n⁴ mod11. Let's compute n from1 to10.

n=1:1.

n=2:16 mod11=5.

n=3:81 mod11=4.

n=4:256 mod11. 256 divided by11: 11*23=253, 256-253=3.

n=5:625 mod11. 11*56=616, 625-616=9.

n=6:1296 mod11. 1296 /11: 11*117=1287, 1296-1287=9.

Wait, wait, n=6: 6²=36≡3 mod11, so 6⁴=(6²)^2=3²=9 mod11.

n=7: 7²=49≡5 mod11, so 7⁴=5²=25≡3 mod11.

n=8:8²=64≡9 mod11, so 8⁴=9²=81≡4 mod11.

n=9:9²=81≡4 mod11, so 9⁴=4²=16≡5 mod11.

n=10:10²=100≡1 mod11, so 10⁴=1²=1 mod11.

So n⁴ mod11 can be 0,1,3,4,5,9.

So n⁴ ≡-1 mod11 is equivalent to n⁴≡10 mod11. But looking at the residues above, 10 is not among them. So p=11 can't have n⁴ ≡-1 mod11, so n⁴ +1 can't be ≡0 mod11, so p=11 is out.

Next prime: p=13.

So check if there's n where n⁴ ≡-1 mod13²=169.

First, check mod13. So n⁴ ≡-1 mod13.

Compute n⁴ mod13.

n from1 to12.

n=1:1.

n=2:16 mod13=3.

n=3:81 mod13=3 (since 13*6=78, 81-78=3).

Wait, n=3: 3⁴=81.

But let me compute step by step.

n=1:1.

n=2: 2⁴=16≡3.

n=3:3⁴=81. 13*6=78, 81-78=3. So ≡3.

n=4:4²=16≡3, 4⁴=3²=9 mod13.

n=5:5²=25≡12, 5⁴=(12)²=144≡1 mod13.

n=6:6²=36≡10, 6⁴=10²=100≡9 mod13.

n=7:7²=49≡10, 7⁴=10²=100≡9 mod13.

n=8:8²=64≡12, 8⁴=12²=144≡1 mod13.

n=9:9²=81≡3, 9⁴=3²=9 mod13.

n=10:10²=100≡9, 10⁴=9²=81≡3 mod13.

n=11:11²=121≡4, 11⁴=4²=16≡3 mod13.

n=12:12²=144≡1, 12⁴=1²=1 mod13.

So n⁴ mod13 can be: 0,1,3,9.

So n⁴ ≡-1 mod13 is equivalent to n⁴ ≡12 mod13. But looking at possible residues, 12 isn't there. So p=13 is out.

Next prime: p=17.

Wait, maybe I'm skipping some. Let's see: after 13 is 17, but wait, 17 is larger. Wait, maybe I should check p=17.

Wait, no, perhaps p=17 is too big. Maybe p=7 was next, but I think I already did p=7. Let me think again.

Wait, the primes after 7 are 11,13,17,19,23,29, etc. So I need to check p=17.

But wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². I remember that for -1 to be a quartic residue, the order of n modulo p² must divide something.

Alternatively, I remember that if p is a prime where the multiplicative order of -1 modulo p² is 4, then -1 is a quartic residue. Wait, perhaps I should use Hensel's lemma or lifting the exponent.

Wait, another approach: if p is an odd prime, and p divides n² +1, then p ≡1 mod4. But in our case, it's n⁴ +1, which can be written as (n²)^2 +1. So maybe primes where -1 is a square in the field modulo p²?

Wait, but let's think about the equation n^4 ≡-1 mod p².

If p is an odd prime, and n^4 ≡-1 mod p², then n^8 ≡1 mod p².

So the order of n modulo p² divides 8. But since n^4 ≡-1, the order doesn't divide 4, so the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group modulo p², which is p(p-1). So 8 divides p(p-1). Since p is prime, either p=2 or p ≡1 mod8, because if p is odd, p-1 must be divisible by8. So p ≡1 mod8.

Therefore, the primes p where such n exists must satisfy p≡1 mod8.

So the smallest primes to check are 17, 97, etc. Wait, wait, 17 is the next prime after 7 that's 1 mod8.

Wait, 17 is 1 mod8: 17=2*8 +1.

So let's check p=17.

So, is there an n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod17²=289?

First, check mod17: n⁴ ≡-1 mod17. So n⁴ ≡16 mod17.

Let me compute n⁴ mod17 for n=1 to16.

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod17=16

n=3:81 mod17. 17*4=68, 81-68=13

n=4:256 mod17. 17*15=255, 256-255=1.

n=5:625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13.

n=6:1296 mod17. Let's compute 6²=36≡2, 6⁴=2²=4.

n=7:7²=49≡15, 7⁴=15²=225≡225-17*13=225-221=4.

n=8:8²=64≡13, 8⁴=13²=169≡16.

n=9:9²=81≡13, 9⁴=13²=169≡16.

n=10:10²=100≡15, 10⁴=15²=225≡4.

n=11:11²=121≡121-17*7=121-119=2, 11⁴=2²=4.

n=12:12²=144≡144-17*8=144-136=8, 12⁴=8²=64≡13.

n=13:13²=169≡16, 13⁴=16²=256≡1.

n=14:14²=196≡196-17*11=196-187=9, 14⁴=9²=81≡13.

n=15:15²=225≡4, 15⁴=4²=16.

n=16:16²=256≡1, 16⁴=1²=1.

So looking at the results, n⁴ mod17 can be 1,4,13,16.

So when is n⁴ ≡16 mod17? From the above, n=2,8,9,15.

So for n=2: 2⁴=16≡16 mod17.

Similarly, n=8: 8⁴≡16 mod17.

So possible candidates.

Now, let's check n=2 mod17. Let's see if 2⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Compute 2⁴=16. 16 mod289=16, which is not 288 (which is -1 mod289). So 2⁴ +1=17 mod289=17, which isn't 0.

Similarly, n=8: 8⁴=4096. Let's compute 4096 mod289.

Compute how many times 289 goes into 4096.

Compute 289*14=4046.

4096 -4046=50. So 8⁴=4096≡50 mod289. 50≠288, so 8⁴ +1≡51 mod289≠0.

Next, n=9: 9⁴=6561. Let's compute 6561 mod289.

Find how many times 289 fits into 6561.

289*22=6358. 6561 -6358=203.

So 9⁴≡203 mod289. 203 +1=204≠0 mod289.

n=15: 15⁴=50625.

Compute 50625 mod289.

Let's compute 289*175=289*(100+75)=28900 +21675=50575.

50625 -50575=50. So 15⁴≡50 mod289. 50 +1=51≠0.

So none of these n=2,8,9,15 mod17 lift to n⁴≡-1 mod289.

Hmm, so maybe p=17 isn't the one. Maybe I need to check higher primes that are 1 mod8.

Next prime after17 is 97, but that's way bigger. Wait, wait, 17 is the next one. Maybe I missed a prime. Let me think.

Wait, 17 is 1 mod8. Wait, p=17 is the first prime after 2,3,5,7,11,13 that is 1 mod8. So perhaps the next candidate is p=97, but that's too big. Alternatively, maybe p=257 or something. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the minimal prime is 17, but I didn't find any n mod17 that lifts to mod289. So perhaps p=17 isn't the right prime. Maybe I need to check higher primes.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I should use Hensel's lemma to lift the solution from mod p to mod p².

So for p=17, if we have a solution to n⁴ ≡-1 mod17, we can try to lift it to mod17².

Suppose n ≡ a mod17, where a⁴ ≡16 mod17.

We have f(n)=n⁴ +1.

We need f(n)≡0 mod17², so f(a +17k)≡0 mod289.

Compute f(a +17k) ≡ (a +17k)^4 +1 ≡ a^4 + 4a³*17k + 6a²*(17k)^2 + 4a*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4 +1.

Modulo17², higher powers of17k (like (17k)^2=289k²≡0 mod289) will vanish. So:

f(a +17k) ≡ a^4 + 4a³*17k +1 mod289.

We know a^4 ≡-1 mod17, so a^4 = -1 +17*m for some m.

Thus, f(a +17k) ≡ (-1 +17m) + 4a³*17k +1 mod289.

Simplify: (-1 +1) +17m + 4a³*17k ≡ 17(m +4a³k) mod289.

We want this ≡0 mod289, so 17(m +4a³k) ≡0 mod289.

Which implies m +4a³k ≡0 mod17.

So, m ≡ -4a³k mod17.

But m comes from a^4 = -1 +17m, so m = (a^4 +1)/17.

Wait, but a^4 ≡-1 mod17, so a^4 +1 ≡0 mod17, so m is an integer.

So, (a^4 +1)/17 ≡ m mod17.

Let me compute m for each a where a⁴ ≡-1 mod17.

From earlier, a can be 2,8,9,15.

Take a=2:

a=2: a^4=16. So a^4 +1=17, so m=17/17=1.

So m=1.

Then, we have the equation: 1 +4*(2)^3 *k ≡0 mod17.

Compute 4*8=32≡15 mod17.

So 1 +15k ≡0 mod17 →15k ≡-1 mod17 →15k≡16 mod17.

Multiplicative inverse of15 mod17 is 8, because 15*8=120≡120-17*7=120-119=1 mod17.

So k≡16*8=128≡128-17*7=128-119=9 mod17.

So k=9 +17*t.

So n = a +17k =2 +17*(9 +17t)=2 +153 +289t=155 +289t.

So n=155 mod289.

Let me check if 155⁴ +1 is divisible by289.

Compute 155 mod17: 155 ÷17=9*17=153, so 155≡2 mod17. Which makes sense, since 2 was our starting point.

Compute 155⁴ mod289.

But calculating 155^4 directly would be tedious. Alternatively, note that n=155 is a solution.

Wait, but I can compute 155 mod289, so 155 is less than289, so n=155.

Compute 155^2: 155²=24025.

Compute 24025 mod289. Let me see how many times 289 goes into24025.

Compute 289*83=289*(80+3)=23120 +867=23987.

24025 -23987=38. So 155²≡38 mod289.

Then, 155^4=(155²)^2=38²=1444.

Compute 1444 mod289. 289*4=1156, 1444-1156=288.

So 155^4 ≡288 mod289, which is -1 mod289. So 155^4 +1 ≡0 mod289. So yes, n=155 is a solution.

So p=17 is the least prime where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So p=17 is the answer for the first part.

Now, the second part: find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by17²=289.

From the above, n=155 is a solution, but I need the smallest positive integer m.

Wait, so 155 is less than289, so 155 is a solution. But maybe there's a smaller positive integer m. So let's check if there's a smaller m than155.

Wait, let's see: in the Hensel lifting, we found that n≡2 mod17 lifts to n=155 mod289. So the minimal solution is n=155.

But wait, perhaps there's another solution with a smaller m. Let's check if any of the other a's (like a=8,9,15) can lead to a smaller m.

Take a=8.

Compute a=8: a^4=8⁴=4096.

4096 mod289: Let's compute as before, 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So 8^4≡50 mod289. So 8^4 +1≡51 mod289≠0.

But using Hensel's lemma for a=8.

Compute m=(a^4 +1)/17=(4096 +1)/17=4097/17=241.

Wait, but 4097/17: 17*241=4097. So m=241.

Then, equation: m +4a³k ≡0 mod17 →241 +4*512*k ≡0 mod17.

Wait, let's compute 241 mod17: 17*14=238, 241-238=3. So 3 mod17.

4a³=4*(8)^3=4*512=2048. 2048 mod17: 17*120=2040, 2048-2040=8.

So 4a³≡8 mod17.

So equation: 3 +8k ≡0 mod17 →8k≡-3≡14 mod17.

Inverse of8 mod17 is since 8*15=120≡120-17*7=1 mod17. So inverse is15.

Thus, k≡14*15=210≡210-17*12=210-204=6 mod17.

So k=6 +17t.

Thus, n= a +17k=8 +17*(6 +17t)=8 +102 +289t=110 +289t.

So n=110 mod289.

Check if 110⁴ +1 is divisible by289.

Compute 110 mod17: 110-17*6=110-102=8. So 110≡8 mod17.

Compute 110^2=12100. Let's mod289.

Compute 289*41=289*40 +289=11560 +289=11849.

12100 -11849=251. So 110²≡251 mod289.

Then, 110^4=(251)^2=63001.

Compute 63001 mod289.

Compute 289*217=289*(200+17)=57800 +4913=62713.

63001 -62713=288.

So 110^4≡288 mod289, which is -1. So 110^4 +1≡0 mod289.

So m=110 is another solution. Since 110<155, it's smaller.

Wait, so m=110 is a solution. Is there a smaller one?

Next, check a=9.

Compute a=9: a^4=6561.

Compute 6561 mod289: 289*22=6358, 6561-6358=203. So 9^4≡203 mod289.

So 9^4 +1=204 mod289≠0.

Now, using Hensel's lemma for a=9.

Compute m=(9^4 +1)/17=(6561+1)/17=6562/17=386.

Wait, 17*386=17*(380+6)=6460 +102=6562. So m=386.

Then, equation: m +4a³k ≡0 mod17.

Compute m=386 mod17.

17*22=374, 386-374=12. So 12 mod17.

4a³=4*(729)=2916. 2916 mod17: let's see, 17*171=2907, 2916-2907=9. So 4a³≡9 mod17.

Equation:12 +9k≡0 mod17 →9k≡-12≡5 mod17.

Inverse of9 mod17 is 2 because 9*2=18≡1 mod17.

So k≡5*2=10 mod17.

Thus, k=10 +17t.

n= a +17k=9 +17*(10 +17t)=9 +170 +289t=179 +289t.

So n=179 mod289.

Check 179^4 +1 mod289.

Compute 179 mod17: 17*10=170, 179-170=9. So 179≡9 mod17.

Compute 179^2=32041.

Compute 32041 mod289.

Compute 289*110=31790.

32041 -31790=251. So 179²≡251 mod289.

Then, 179^4=(251)^2=63001 mod289.

As before, 63001 mod289=288, so 179^4≡-1 mod289.

Thus, 179^4 +1≡0 mod289. So m=179 is another solution, but it's larger than 110.

Similarly, check a=15.

a=15: a^4=50625.

Compute 50625 mod289: 289*175=50575, 50625-50575=50. So 15^4≡50 mod289.

So 50 +1=51≠0 mod289.

Use Hensel's lemma for a=15.

Compute m=(15^4 +1)/17=(50625 +1)/17=50626/17=2978.

Wait, 17*2978=50626, correct.

m=2978 mod17.

Compute 2978 ÷17: 17*175=2975, so 2978-2975=3. So m≡3 mod17.

4a³=4*(3375)=13500. 13500 mod17.

Compute 17*794=13500-17*(794)=13500-13500=0? No, wait, 17*794=17*(700 +94)=11900 +1598=13498.

13500-13498=2. So 4a³≡2 mod17.

Equation:3 +2k≡0 mod17 →2k≡-3≡14 mod17.

Inverse of2 mod17 is9 because 2*9=18≡1.

So k≡14*9=126≡126-17*7=126-119=7 mod17.

Thus, k=7 +17t.

n= a +17k=15 +17*(7 +17t)=15 +119 +289t=134 +289t.

Check 134 mod289: 134 is less than289, so compute 134^4 +1 mod289.

Compute 134 mod17: 17*7=119, 134-119=15. So 134≡15 mod17.

Compute 134²=17956.

17956 mod289: Let's compute 289*62=289*(60+2)=17340 +578=17918.

17956 -17918=38. So 134²≡38 mod289.

Then, 134^4=(38)^2=1444 mod289.

As before, 1444-5*289=1444-1445=-1≡288 mod289.

So 134^4≡-1 mod289. So 134^4 +1≡0 mod289.

So m=134 is another solution, and 134 is smaller than155 but larger than110.

So the minimal m is110.

Wait, but let's make sure there's no smaller m. Since 110 is the smallest among the solutions we found:110,134,155,179.

Wait, but maybe there's a smaller m in the range1 to288. Let's see.

Wait, n=110 is the smallest I've found so far. Let me check if n=110 is indeed the minimal.

Wait, let me compute n=110: 110 is less than289, so that's the minimal positive solution.

Wait, but wait a second. What about n=179? It's larger than110, so 110 is smaller. Similarly, 134 is larger than110.

So the minimal m is110.

Wait, but let me check if there's a smaller m than110.

Wait, I can think of m as being in the range1 to288. So 110 is the smallest, but let me check if any m less than110 could satisfy m^4 +1 ≡0 mod289.

Let me try m=10: 10^4=10000. 10000 mod289: let's compute.

289*34=9826. 10000-9826=174. 174 +1=175≠0.

m=20: 20^4=160000. 160000 ÷289= let's see, 289*553=289*(500+53)=144500 +15317=159817. 160000-159817=183. 183 +1=184≠0.

m=30:30^4=810000. 810000 ÷289: 289*2800=809200. 810000-809200=800. 800 mod289: 289*2=578, 800-578=222. 222 +1=223≠0.

m=40:40^4=2560000. 2560000 ÷289: 289*8850=289*(8000+850)=2312000 +245650=2557650. 2560000-2557650=2350.

2350 ÷289: 289*8=2312. 2350-2312=38. So 40^4 mod289=38. 38+1=39≠0.

m=50:50^4=6,250,000. Let's compute mod289.

Compute 50²=2500. 2500 mod289: 289*8=2312. 2500-2312=188.

Then, 50^4=(188)^2=35344.

35344 ÷289: 289*122=289*(120+2)=34680 +578=35258. 35344-35258=86. 86 +1=87≠0.

m=60:60^4=12^4 *10^4=20736*10000= but wait, compute 60²=3600. 3600 mod289: 289*12=3468, 3600-3468=132.

60^4=(132)^2=17424.

17424 ÷289: 289*60=17340. 17424-17340=84. 84 +1=85≠0.

m=70:70^4= (70²)^2=4900^2. Compute 4900 mod289: 289*16=4624, 4900-4624=276.

70^4=276²=76176.

76176 ÷289: 289*263=289*(200+60+3)=57800 +17340 +867=57800+17340=75140 +867=76007.

76176-76007=169. 169 +1=170≠0.

m=80:80^4=40960000. Let's compute mod289.

80²=6400. 6400 mod289: 289*21=6069, 6400-6069=331. 331-289=42. So 80²≡42 mod289.

80^4=42²=1764. 1764 mod289: 289*6=1734, 1764-1734=30. 30 +1=31≠0.

m=90:90^4= (90²)^2=8100^2. 8100 mod289: 289*28=8092, 8100-8092=8. So 90²≡8 mod289.

90^4=8²=64 mod289. 64 +1=65≠0.

m=100:100^4=100000000. Compute 100 mod289=100.

100²=10000 mod289. 289*34=9826, 10000-9826=174. So 100²≡174 mod289.

100^4=174²=30276 mod289.

Compute 30276 ÷289: 289*104=289*(100+4)=28900 +1156=30056. 30276-30056=220. 220 +1=221≠0.

m=110: As before, 110^4 +1≡0 mod289. So 110 is the minimal m.

Wait, but let me check if m=110 is indeed the smallest. Because when I did the Hensel's lemma for a=8, I got m=110, which is less than the others. So m=110 is the minimal positive integer.

Thus, the least prime p is17, and the minimal m is110.


The least prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \) is \( 17 \). The smallest positive integer \( m \) for which \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \) is \( 110 \).

\(\boxed{110}\)
