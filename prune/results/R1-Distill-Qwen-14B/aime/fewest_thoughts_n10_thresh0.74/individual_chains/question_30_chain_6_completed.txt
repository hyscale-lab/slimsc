Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω ≠ 1 is a 13th root of unity. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when working modulo integers. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and all the powers from 0 to 12 are distinct.

The expression I'm dealing with is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let's denote each term as f(ω^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x². So, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k). 

Wait, but since ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity, maybe I can relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at certain points. I recall that for a polynomial P(x), the product of P(ω^k) for k from 0 to 12 is equal to the resultant of P(x) and x^13 - 1, or something along those lines. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the value of the polynomial when multiplied by cyclotomic polynomials.

Let me think. The product over all roots of unity of (x - ω^k) is x^13 - 1. So, if I have a function f(ω^k), the product ∏ f(ω^k) might be the same as the product of f(x) evaluated at each root, which would relate to the value of the polynomial f(x) over the cyclotomic polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as evaluating the resultant or something else. Wait, another idea: if I have a polynomial P(x) = x^13 - 1, then any polynomial Q(x) can be written as Q(x) = P(x) * S(x) + R(x), where R(x) is the remainder with degree less than 13. So, maybe evaluating the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) is equivalent to evaluating the resultant of f(x) and P(x), but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, since ω is a root of x^13 - 1, perhaps I can substitute x = ω^k, and then the product becomes the product over k of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) which is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). 

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can write f(x) as 2 - 2x + x². Let me try to factor this or simplify it. Hmm, let's see:

f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Let's try to factor this. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so it doesn't factor over real numbers, but it can be written in terms of complex roots. The roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, f(x) = (x - 1 - i)(x - 1 + i). Therefore, the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - 1 - i)(ω^k - 1 + i). 

Which is equal to ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) * ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)). 

But wait, I know that for a primitive nth root of unity ω, the product ∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - ω^k) = x^n - 1. So, in this case, n=13, so ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. Therefore, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I set x = a, then ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1. So, yes, that's right. 

So, in this case, for a = 1 + i, the first product is (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, the second product is (1 - i)^13 - 1. So, the entire product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].

Hmm, okay, so now I need to compute (1 + i)^13, subtract 1, multiply by (1 - i)^13 - 1, and then take the product. Then, take the result modulo 1000.

Let me compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13π/4}. Let's compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, e^{i * 13π/4}. 13π/4 is equivalent to 13π/4 - 2π * 1 = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So, e^{i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

So, putting it together, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2). Let's compute that.

First, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1. Similarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = -i*(2)/2 = -i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * (-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, compute (1 - i)^13. 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Again, (sqrt(2))^13 is 64 * sqrt(2). And e^{-i * 13π/4} is the same as e^{i * ( -13π/4)}.

But, -13π/4 is equivalent to adding multiples of 2π. Let's compute -13π/4 + 4π = (-13π/4 + 16π/4) = 3π/4. So, e^{-i13π/4} = e^{i3π/4} = cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check: e^{-i13π/4} is the same as e^{i( -13π/4 + 2π * 2)} = e^{i ( -13π/4 + 8π/4)} = e^{i (-5π/4)}. Alternatively, it's easier to compute e^{-i13π/4} as e^{-i(3π/4 + 2π * 1)} = e^{-i3π/4}.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 13π/4 is 3π + π/4. So, e^{i13π/4} = e^{i(3π + π/4)} = e^{iπ} * e^{iπ/4} = (-1) * (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2, which matches our earlier calculation.

So, going back, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i13π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [cos(-13π/4) + i sin(-13π/4)].

But -13π/4 is the same as 3π/4 in a different rotation, but perhaps it's easier to compute it as:

Alternatively, since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), (1 - i)^13 would be the conjugate of (1 + i)^13. Since (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, then (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate, which is -64 + 64i.

Wait, let me verify:

(1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i13π/4} = 64*sqrt(2)*e^{-i13π/4}.

Now, 13π/4 is 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to -π/4 when considering periodicity (since 3π is π more than 2π, so subtract 2π: 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4; wait, no, that's for positive angles. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute e^{-i13π/4}:

13π/4 is 3π + π/4, so -13π/4 is -3π - π/4. Adding 4π (since e^{iθ} is periodic with period 2π) to get it into [0, 2π):

-13π/4 + 4π = (-13π/4 + 16π/4) = 3π/4. So, e^{-i13π/4} = e^{i3π/4} = cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

So, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) + sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2)).

Compute sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.

sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = i*(2)/2 = i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.

So, now, back to the product:

[(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1] = [(-64 -64i) - 1] * [(-64 +64i) -1] = (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i).

Multiplying these two complex numbers: Let me compute (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). This is of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b², where a = -65 and b = 64i. Wait, no, more accurately, it's (c)(c*), where c = -65 -64i, so the product is |c|².

But to compute it step by step:

(-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65).

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to do as (a + b)(a - b) where a = -65 and b = 64i, but actually, that's not exactly the case because signs would differ. Alternatively, just multiply term by term.

Alternatively, use the formula (x + y)(x - y) = x² - y², but here x is -65 and y is 64i, so:

(-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i²) = 4225 - (4096*(-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, let me compute that again:

(-65)^2 = 4225.

(64i)^2 = 64^2 * i^2 = 4096*(-1) = -4096.

So, (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So, the product is 8321.

Wait, but that can't be right because 8321 is a real number, which makes sense since the product of complex conjugates is real.

So, the original product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) equals 8321.

So, now, we need the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000. That is, compute 8321 mod 1000.

Well, 1000 * 8 = 8000. 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but let me double-check the computation:

Compute (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i).

Wait, that approach may lead me to the same result but perhaps I should go through the multiplication step by step:

First, multiply -65 by -65: 4225.

Then, -65 * 64i = -4160i.

Then, -64i * -65 = +4160i.

Then, -64i * 64i = (-64)(64)(i^2) = (-4096)(-1) = 4096.

Now, add all together:

4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.

The -4160i and +4160i cancel each other, leaving 4225 +4096 = 8321. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the product is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the initial step. When I had f(x) = x² - 2x + 2, which factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), so ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) (ω^k - (1 - i)) = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

And since ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1, then ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1. So, substituting a =1 + i, we get (1 + i)^13 - 1, and similarly for a =1 - i, (1 - i)^13 -1.

So, yes, the product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1][(1 - i)^13 -1] = 8321.

So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but let me just make sure that 8321 is correct. Let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 again.

(1 + i) is sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}. So, (1 + i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13π/4}.

(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

e^{i13π/4} = e^{i(3π + π/4)} = e^{iπ} * e^{iπ/4} = (-1)(cos π/4 + i sin π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

So, multiplying 64 sqrt(2) by that gives:

64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-i)*(2)/2 = 64*(-i) = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Subtracting 1 gives (-64 -64i) - 1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 is sqrt(2)^13 e^{-i13π/4}.

e^{-i13π/4} = e^{-i(3π + π/4)} = e^{-iπ} * e^{-iπ/4} = (-1)(cos π/4 - i sin π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, no: e^{-i13π/4} = e^{-i(3π + π/4)} = e^{-iπ} * e^{-iπ/4} = (-1)(cos π/4 - i sin π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, but wait, cos(-θ) = cosθ, sin(-θ) = -sinθ.

Alternatively, e^{-i13π/4} = e^{i( -13π/4 + 4π)} = e^{i( 3π/4)}.

Which is cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

So, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i13π/4} = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

Compute that:

64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2)/2 = -64.

64 sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(i*2)/2 = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i. Subtracting 1 gives (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

So, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = [(-65)^2 - (64i)^2] = 4225 - (-4096) = 8321. So, correct.

Thus, 8321 mod 1000 is 321, as 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.

Wait, but I just realized, is 8321 correct? Because the product over all roots of unity of (x - ω^k) is x^13 - 1, so substituting x = (1 + i), the product would be (1 + i)^13 -1, but I multiplied by (1 - i)^13 -1 as well, but I think that's correct because the original function f(x) is (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), so the product is indeed the product over all roots of (x - a)(x - a*) where a = 1 + i, and a* is its conjugate.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to compute this product without dealing with complex numbers, maybe using some properties of cyclotomic polynomials or minimal polynomials. But perhaps not necessary since the approach I took seems correct.

Wait, another check: let's compute (1 + i)^13 in another way. Since 1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, then (1 + i)^(13) is (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13π/4}.

We have (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

And e^{i13π/4} = e^{i(3π + π/4)} = e^{iπ} * e^{iπ/4} = (-1)(cos π/4 + i sin π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

Multiplying 64 * sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2):

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i) * (2)/2 = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, which matches what I had earlier. Subtracting 1 gives -65 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 is sqrt(2)^13 e^{-i13π/4}.

sqrt(2)^13 is 64 sqrt(2), as before.

e^{-i13π/4} = e^{-i(3π + π/4)} = e^{-iπ} * e^{-iπ/4} = (-1)(cos π/4 - i sin π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

Multiplying 64 sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2):

64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.

64 sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i, subtracting 1 gives -65 +64i.

Multiplying these two gives (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - ( -4096 ) = 8321.

Yes, so that's correct.

So, the product is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the multiplication step. Let me compute (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) again.

Using the formula (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², but in this case, a is -65, and b is 64i. So, it's (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.

(-65)^2 = 4225.

(64i)^2 = (64)^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.

So, 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes, correct.

So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 * 1000 = 8000, remainder 321. Therefore, the answer is 321.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because 8321 is a relatively small number, and I'm wondering if I made an error in the exponents or the initial function.

Wait, let me check the product again.

We have f(x) = x² - 2x + 2, which we factored as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Then, the product over k=0 to 12 of f(ω^k) is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Which is equal to ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) * ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)).

And since ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1, so substituting a = 1 + i, we get (1 + i)^13 - 1, and a =1 - i gives (1 - i)^13 -1.

So, the product is [(1 + i)^13 -1] * [(1 - i)^13 -1] = 8321, which is correct.

So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Thus, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, satisfying ω¹³ = 1. We need to compute the product:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

We denote each term in the product as \( f(\omega^k) \) where \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \). Notice that \( f(x) \) factors as \( (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) \), where \( i \) is the imaginary unit.

Thus, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \cdot \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i))
\]

Using the property of roots of unity, we know that for any integer \( a \), \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \omega^k) = a^{13} - 1 \). Applying this, we substitute \( a = 1 + i \) and \( a = 1 - i \):

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \omega^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1
\]
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \omega^k) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1
\]

Next, we compute \( (1 + i)^{13} \) and \( (1 - i)^{13} \). Expressing \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 - i \) in polar form:

\[
1 + i = \sqrt{2} \cdot e^{i\pi/4}, \quad 1 - i = \sqrt{2} \cdot e^{-i\pi/4}
\]

Raising to the 13th power:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \cdot e^{i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 64\sqrt{2} \cdot (-\sqrt{2}/2 - i\sqrt{2}/2) = -64 - 64i
\]
\[
(1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \cdot e^{-i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 64\sqrt{2} \cdot (-\sqrt{2}/2 + i\sqrt{2}/2) = -64 + 64i
\]

Subtracting 1 from each:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i, \quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i
\]

The product is:

\[
(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 8321
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

Thus, the remainder is:

\[
\boxed{321}
\]
