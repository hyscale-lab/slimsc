Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, so the variables are tied together in a simple sum. But the second equation is a bit more complicated—it's a combination of quadratic and linear terms. I wonder if there's a way to simplify or factor that expression.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two different variables, where one is squared. Maybe I can factor it somehow. Let me see.

Let me factor out common terms. For example, a²b + a²c can be written as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that's a bit cleaner. But I still need to relate it to the first equation, which is a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can substitute something here.

Since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substituting these into the expression:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So the second equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a cubic equation in terms of each variable. It might be challenging to handle all three variables at once. Maybe I can find a way to express this in terms of symmetric functions or find some symmetry in the variables.

Wait a second, the problem is symmetric in a, b, c. So perhaps the solutions might have some symmetry as well. Maybe we can assume that two variables are equal, or all three are equal? Let's check if all three being equal gives a solution.

If a = b = c, then from a + b + c = 300, each would be 100. Plugging into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6 * a²a = 6a³. Since a = 100, 6*(100)^3 = 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Oh, that works! So (100, 100, 100) is definitely a solution.

But the problem is asking for the number of triples, so there might be more solutions. Maybe some where two variables are equal and the third is different, or all different.

Wait, I should check if the variables can be different. Let's consider a case where two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different.

If a = b, then from a + b + c = 300, we get 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.

Now, substitute a = b and c = 300 - 2a into the second equation.

So the expression becomes:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

But since a = b, this simplifies to:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a

Combine like terms:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c²

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²)

Hmm, since c = 300 - 2a, we can substitute that in:

2a [ a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute a²:

a².

Then, compute a(300 - 2a):

300a - 2a².

Then, compute (300 - 2a)^2:

= 300² - 2*300*2a + (2a)^2
= 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a².

So putting it all together inside the brackets:

a² + (300a - 2a²) + (90,000 - 1,200a + 4a²)
= a² + 300a - 2a² + 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a²
Combine like terms:

a² -2a² +4a² = 3a²

300a -1200a = -900a

And then +90,000.

So the expression inside the brackets becomes: 3a² - 900a + 90,000

So the entire expression is 2a*(3a² -900a + 90,000) = 6,000,000.

So we have:

2a*(3a² -900a + 90,000) = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 2:

a*(3a² -900a + 90,000) = 3,000,000

Multiply through:

3a³ -900a² +90,000a = 3,000,000

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

a³ - 300a² +30,000a = 1,000,000

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ -300a² +30,000a -1,000,000 = 0

Hmm, so we have a cubic equation in a. Let's see if we can find integer roots for this equation.

The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 over factors of 1, so integer divisors of 1,000,000.

But considering that a must be a nonnegative integer and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, a can range from 0 to 150.

Let me test a=100, because in the symmetric case, a=100 is a solution.

Plugging a=100:

100³ -300*(100)^2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000
= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000
= (1,000,000 - 1,000,000) + (-3,000,000 + 3,000,000)
= 0 + 0 = 0. So yes, a=100 is a root.

Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factorization.

Divide the cubic by (a - 100). Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000

Using root a=100:

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 100: 1*100=100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.

Multiply by 100: -200*100= -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000.

Multiply by 100: 10,000*100=1,000,000. Add to last coefficient: -1,000,000 +1,000,000=0.

So the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² -200a + 10,000) =0.

So the other roots are solutions to a² -200a +10,000=0.

Let me solve this quadratic equation:

a = [200 ± sqrt(200² -4*1*10,000)] / 2
= [200 ± sqrt(40,000 -40,000)] / 2
= [200 ± 0]/2
= 100.

So the cubic equation factors as (a -100)^2 (a - 100) = (a -100)^3 =0.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because when I did synthetic division, I got a quadratic factor a² -200a +10,000 which factors into (a -100)^2. So the original cubic is (a -100)^3 =0. So the only real root is a=100, with multiplicity 3.

But wait, in our substitution, we assumed a = b, so c = 300 -2a. If a=100, then c=300 -200=100. So when a=100, c=100, which brings us back to the symmetric case where a=b=c=100. So in this case, the only solution when a=b is the
