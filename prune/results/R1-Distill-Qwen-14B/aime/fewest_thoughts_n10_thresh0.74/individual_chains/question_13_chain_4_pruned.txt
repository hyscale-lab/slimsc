Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to understand what's going on. 

Every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, let me break down the information given. 

First scenario: She walks at a constant speed of s km/h. The total time she takes, including t minutes in the coffee shop, is 4 hours. 

Second scenario: She walks faster, at s + 2 km/h. This time, including t minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes.

Wait, so in both cases, the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals the given total. But the walking time itself depends on her speed because she's covering the same 9 km distance. 

So, the key here is to set up equations based on the first two scenarios and solve for s and t. Then, using those values, calculate the time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me write down the first scenario. 

The time she spends walking is the distance divided by speed. So, walking time = 9 / s hours. Then, she spends t minutes in the coffee shop. But wait, the total time given is in hours, so I should convert t minutes to hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours. 

So, total time in first scenario: (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4 hours.

Similarly, for the second scenario, her speed is s + 2 km/h. So, walking time is 9 / (s + 2) hours. Coffee shop time is still t minutes, which is t/60 hours. Total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 

24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours total. So, the equation is:

(9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4 hours.

Now I have two equations:

1. (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4
2. (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

Let me denote t/60 as T for simplicity. So, T = t / 60, which means t = 60T.

So, the equations become:

1. (9 / s) + T = 4
2. (9 / (s + 2)) + T = 2.4

Now, I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate T:

(9/s + T) - (9/(s+2) + T) = 4 - 2.4
Simplify:
9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2):

That's equal to 9*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 9*[(s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2))] ) = 9*(2)/(s(s + 2)) = 18/(s(s + 2)).

So, 18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6.

Let me write that equation:

18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6

I can write 1.6 as a fraction. 1.6 is 8/5. So,

18/(s(s + 2)) = 8/5

Cross-multiplying:

18 * 5 = 8 * s(s + 2)
90 = 8s(s + 2)

So, 90 = 8s² + 16s

Let me bring everything to one side:

8s² + 16s - 90 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in s. Let me simplify it.

Dividing all terms by 2:

4s² + 8s - 45 = 0

Now, applying the quadratic formula. The quadratic is 4s² +8s -45=0.

Quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=4, b=8, c=-45.

So, discriminant D = b² -4ac = 64 -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784.

Square root of 784 is 28.

So, s = [-8 ±28]/(2*4) = (20)/(8) or (-36)/(8).

So, s = 20/8 = 2.5 km/h, or s = -36/8 = -4.5 km/h. Since speed can't be negative, s must be 2.5 km/h.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check that because 2.5 km/h seems a bit slow for a walking speed. But okay, let's proceed.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find T from the first equation.

From equation 1: (9/s) + T = 4

So,
