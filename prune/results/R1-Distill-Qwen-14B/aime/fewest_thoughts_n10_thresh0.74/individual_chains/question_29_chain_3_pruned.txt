Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm, that's interesting. So, if I imagine these rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, overlapping or placed next to each other in such a way that D and E are points on a line that also includes C and F. 

Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. I remember that if four points lie on a circle, certain properties must hold, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees if they form a quadrilateral. Maybe that will come into play later.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Let me note down what I know about the rectangles. In rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, opposite sides are equal: EF = GH = 184, FG = EH = 17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line must be a straight line passing through points D, E, C, F in that order or some other order. Wait, the order isn't specified, but typically, in such problems, they might be in the order D-E-C-F along the line. But I should confirm that.

Let me try to sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has points A, B, C, D. Let's say it's placed such that AB is the base with length 107, BC is the height with length 16. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle, perhaps placed adjacent or overlapping with ABCD. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, maybe E and F are on the same line as D and C.

Wait, but E is a vertex of rectangle EFGH, and F is another vertex. So, perhaps EFGH is placed such that its side EF is along the line that includes D and C. Hmm, but EF is given as 184, which is much longer than BC which is 16.

Wait a minute, the line D-E-C-F is a straight line. So, the distance from D to C is the length of DC, which in rectangle ABCD is AB, which is 107. So, DC = AB = 107. So, the distance between D and C is 107 units.

But in the line, we have points D, E, C, F. So, the entire length from D to F would be DC plus CF, but wait, is
