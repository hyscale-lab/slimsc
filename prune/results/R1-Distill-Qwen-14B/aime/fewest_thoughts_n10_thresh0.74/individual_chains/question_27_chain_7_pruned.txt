Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by revolving a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3 units, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside this sphere and be tangent to it, which is called internal tangency, and it can also rest outside, being externally tangent. The points of tangency are along circles, and these circles have radii r_i (internal) and r_o (external). The problem is asking for the difference r_i - r_o, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then m + n.

I think I need to find the radii of these tangent circles when the torus is inside and outside the sphere. Then subtract them to get the difference.

First, let me recall some properties of a torus. The torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle.

In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So, the standard equation of a torus in 3D space would be (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. But I'm not sure if I need the equation right now.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent to the sphere along a circle. The sphere has a radius of 11. So, the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus must be such that the torus just touches the sphere internally. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the distance between centers leads to external tangency.

Wait, but the sphere is fixed with radius 11, and the torus is being placed inside or outside. So, for internal tangency, the torus lies entirely inside the sphere, touching it at one circle. For external tangency, the torus encloses the sphere, touching it at another circle.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the maximum and minimum distances from the center of the sphere to the torus's surface.

Wait, the torus has a center at some point, probably the same as the sphere's center? Or maybe not? I think the torus can be placed such that its center coincides with the sphere's center for both internal and external cases. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no. When the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is such that the torus is entirely within the sphere, just touching it. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus encloses the sphere, touching it externally.

Let me think in terms
