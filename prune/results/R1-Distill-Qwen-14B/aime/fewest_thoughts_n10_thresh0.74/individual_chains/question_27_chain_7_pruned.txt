Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize what's going on here. 

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in its plane. The axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, when you spin this circle around the axis, you get a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11.

The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's on the outside, it's externally tangent with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to find expressions for r_i and r_o in terms of the given radii of the torus and the sphere.

Let me recall the properties of a torus. A torus can be described by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. 

So the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. 

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent internally. That means the sphere is outside the torus, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, they're tangent externally along another circle.

Wait, actually, the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, meaning the torus is inside the sphere. Similarly, when it rests on the outside, the torus is outside the sphere. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger and touches the torus from the outside, meaning perhaps the sphere is externally tangent to the torus? Or maybe I'm mixing up terms.

Let me clarify the terminology. Internal and external tangency can be a bit confusing. When T is inside S and tangent internally, that means the sphere S is external to the torus T, and they touch along a circle. So, the point of tangency is on the outer surface of T and the inner surface of S? Wait, but S is a sphere, which doesn't have an inner or outer surface in the same way as a torus. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps when T is inside S, the sphere S encloses the torus T, and they are tangent at some points. Similarly, when T is outside S, the torus encloses the sphere.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so when it's inside the sphere, the sphere's surface touches the torus's surface at some point or along a circle. Same when it's outside.

But in any case, I think the key is to find the radii of the circles along which the torus and sphere are tangent. So, these circles lie on the surface of the sphere and the torus.

Perhaps I should model this mathematically. Let me consider the sphere and the torus in 3D space.

The sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

The torus T can be represented parametrically. The standard equation for a torus is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r², where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. So in this case, R = 6 and r = 3. So the equation is (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9.

Now, when the torus is tangent to the sphere, the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle of the torus must be such that the surfaces touch.

Wait, actually, the torus is centered at the origin, I suppose, since the problem doesn't specify otherwise. So the sphere is also centered at the origin, with radius 11, and the torus is centered at the origin as well.

Wait a second, but when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is larger,
