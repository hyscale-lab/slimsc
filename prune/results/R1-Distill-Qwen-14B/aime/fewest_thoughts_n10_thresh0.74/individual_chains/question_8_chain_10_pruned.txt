Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I notice that the equation involving a, b, and c is symmetric in a, b, and c. That might be helpful. Maybe I can factor it or rewrite it in a way that makes use of the symmetry. Let me see.

The expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b looks a bit complicated, but I remember that sometimes expressions like these can be factored. Let me try to group terms. I can factor out a² from the first two terms, b² from the next two, and c² from the last two:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that looks a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute for (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b). Let's see:

Since a + b + c = 300, then:
- b + c = 300 - a
- a + c = 300 - b
- a + b = 300 - c

So substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

Which simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³.

So, the equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's still a bit messy, but maybe I can factor it differently. Let me see if I can write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

That looks a bit better. Maybe I can find another way to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and ab + bc + ca. I remember that there's a formula for a³ + b³ + c³:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, let's denote:
- S = a + b + c = 300
- Q = ab + bc + ca
- P = abc

Then, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

Substituting back into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (S³ - 3SQ + 3P) = 6,000,000.

But wait, I also need to express a² + b² + c² in terms of S, Q, and maybe P. I know that:

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q.

So, substituting that in:

300(S² - 2Q) - (S³ - 3SQ + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Now, let's plug in S = 300:

300*(300² - 2Q) - (300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Calculating each term:

First term: 300*(300² - 2Q) = 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Second term: 300³ = 27,000,000. So, 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.

Putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600Q - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Simplify the left side:

27,000,000 - 600Q -27,000,000 + 900Q -3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify terms:

(27,000,000 -27,000,000) + (-600Q + 900Q) -3P = 6,000,000.

So, 0 + 300Q -3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, the equation simplifies to:

P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Now, we have S = 300, and P = 100Q - 2,000,000. So our variables are Q and P, and they must satisfy this equation.

But we also know that for nonnegative integers a, b, c, the variables Q and P are symmetric functions of a, b, c. So, perhaps we can express everything in terms of Q.

But let's see if we can find another equation involving Q and P. Since we have S, Q, and P, maybe we can find another relation.

Wait, but since we have S, Q, and P, and they are related through the equation P = 100Q - 2,000,000, perhaps we can use other constraints.

Wait, let's think about possible values of a, b, c. Since they are nonnegative integers summing to 300, each of a, b, c can be between 0 and 300.

But perhaps, to make the problem manageable, we can consider that in the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, each term is nonnegative. So, if one of a, b, c is zero, then terms involving it might vanish.

But maybe it's better to consider cases where all a, b, c are positive or some are zero.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that since the equation is symmetric, maybe we can assume some ordering, say a ≤ b ≤ c, and then multiply by the number of permutations.

But before that, perhaps we can think about possible values of a, b, c.

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, perhaps it's helpful to consider the possible triples where two of them are equal, or all are equal, etc.

But let me think, since we've already got S = 300 and P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But we can also recall that in symmetric polynomials, for three variables:

The monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is x³ - Sx² + Qx - P = 0.

So, the polynomial is x³ - 300x² + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify that:

x³ - 300x² + Qx -100Q + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can factor this equation.

Wait, let me rearrange terms:

x³ - 300
