Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, and another equation involving a, b, c: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me write down the equations to get a clearer picture.

First equation: a + b + c = 300.

Second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I notice that the second equation can be factored or rearranged somehow. Let me see. It looks like each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor it.

Let me factor the second equation:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since from the first equation a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly for the others.

So the equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300 from the a² and b² and c² terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate this to the sum a + b + c. Maybe using some algebraic identities.

I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of (a + b + c), (ab + bc + ca), and abc. The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Similarly, a² + b² + c² can be expressed as:

(a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

So maybe if I denote S = a + b + c = 300, and P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

Then, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P = 300² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

And a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3Q = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q.

So substituting these into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Plugging in the expressions:

300*(90,000 - 2P) - [300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2P):

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2P) = -600P.

So the first part is 27,000,000 - 600P.

Now, compute the second part:

300³ is 27,000,000.

Then, -3*300*P = -900P.

And then +3Q.

So the second part is 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.

Putting it all together in the equation:

[27,000,000 - 600P] - [27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign into the second bracket:

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Now, combine like terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600P + 900P = 300P.

-3Q remains.

So, 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Let me write that as:

300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

I can factor out 3:

3*(100P - Q) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

Which implies that Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

But since Q = abc, which is the product of nonnegative integers a, b, c, Q must be a nonnegative integer as well.

So, 100P - 2,000,000 >= 0.

Which implies that 100P >= 2,000,000.

So, P >= 20,000.

But also, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P is also nonnegative. But here P is at least 20,000.

Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure.

Wait, 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, 100P = Q + 2,000,000.

Since Q is nonnegative, 100P must be at least 2,000,000, so P >= 20,000.

Okay, so moving forward.

So, we have P = ab + bc + ca.

We also know that a + b + c = 300.

So, I have S = 300, P = ab + bc + ca >= 20,000.

We need to find all triples (a, b, c) such that S = 300, P >= 20,000, and Q = 100P - 2,000,000, which is also nonnegative.

Hmm, I'm not sure if I can proceed directly from here. Maybe I can consider specific cases or find a way to relate these variables.

Another approach: since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps assuming some ordering, like a <= b <= c, and then counting the number of such triples and multiplying by the number of permutations.

But since the problem is symmetric, maybe I can also think in terms of variables being equal or different.

Alternatively, maybe consider that for a, b, c, two of them must be equal or all different. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me think.

Since a + b + c = 300, perhaps write c = 300 - a - b, then substitute into the second equation.

But that might get complicated, but let me try.

So, c = 300 - a - b.

Substitute into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Express everything in terms of a and b.

So:

a²b + a²(300 - a - b) + b²a + b²(300 - a - b) + (300 - a - b)^2a + (300 - a - b)^2b = 6,000,000.

That's a bit messy, but maybe manageable.

Let me compute each term:

1. a²b
2. a²(300 - a - b) = 300a² - a³ - a²b
3. b²a
4. b²(300 - a - b) = 300b² - ab² - b³
5. (300 - a - b)^2 a
6. (300 - a - b)^2 b

So adding all terms together:

Term 1: a²b

Term 2: 300a² - a³ - a²b

Term 3: b²a

Term 4: 300b² - ab² - b³

Term 5: [ (300 - a - b)^2 ] * a

Term 6: [ (300 - a - b)^2 ] * b

Now, let's sum all these:

Adding Term1 and Term2:

a²b + 300a² - a³ - a²b = 300a² - a³.

Similarly, adding Term3 and Term4:

b²a + 300b² - ab² - b³ = 300b² - b³.

Then, Terms5 and 6 are:

[ (300 - a - b)^2 ] * (a + b) 

Let me compute (300 - a - b)^2 = (300 - (a + b))^2 = 300² - 2*300*(a + b) + (a + b)^2 = 90,000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b².

Multiply this by (a + b):

= [90,000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b²] * (a + b)

= 90,000(a + b) - 600(a + b)^2 + (a² + 2ab + b²)(a + b)

Let me expand each part:

First term: 90,000(a + b)

Second term: -600(a² + 2ab + b²)

Third term: (a² + 2ab + b²)(a + b) = a³ + 2a²b + ab² + a²b + 2ab² + b³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³.

So putting it all together:

= 90,000(a + b) - 600(a² + 2ab + b²) + a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³.

So now, combining all terms:

Total expression is:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 90,000(a + b) - 600(a
