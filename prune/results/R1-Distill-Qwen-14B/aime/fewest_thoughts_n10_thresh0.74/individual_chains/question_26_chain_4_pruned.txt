Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC. The triangle is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. I need to find AP in the form m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then give m + n.

First, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C intersect at D, which is the ex-pole or something? Then, connecting AD and it intersects ω again at P.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside the circle, that point is called the external homothety center or the ex-similicenter. So, D is the ex-similicenter of the circle with respect to B and C. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's the ex-pole.

Wait, tangents from D touch the circle at B and C, so D is the ex-pole with respect to BC? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think about properties related to D.

I remember that the point where two tangents meet has some harmonic properties. Maybe I can use power of a point. The power of D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC² because they are both tangents from D. So, DB = DC, right?

Wait, no, that's only if the tangents are equal in length. But in this case, the tangents at B and C; since B and C are different points on the circle, the lengths DB and DC could be different unless the triangle is isoceles. But our triangle isn't isoceles. So, actually, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC², which implies DB = DC. Oh, right, because the power is the same, so the lengths of the two tangents from D to ω are equal. Therefore, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC.

Wait, but BC is a side of the triangle. So, the perpendicular bisector of BC would pass through the circumcenter O of triangle ABC. Hmm, maybe that's useful later.

So, knowing that DB=DC, so D is equidistant from B and C. That might help in some coordinate geometry approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use inversion. Inversion can sometimes make these tangent problems easier. But I'm not too familiar with inversion techniques, so maybe I should stick to more basic methods.

Another approach is to use projective geometry or harmonic division. Since AD passes through P, which is on ω, maybe there's a harmonic bundle here. Alternatively, perhaps using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.

Let me think about coordinates. Maybe I can place the triangle in a coordinate plane to calculate coordinates of D and then find where AD intersects ω again.

Let me try that. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0) because AC=10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Since AB=5 and BC=9, I can find the coordinates of B.

So, let's set up the coordinates:

- C: (0,0)
- A: (10,0)
- B: (x,y), which we need to find.

From AB=5, the distance between A(10,0) and B(x,y) is 5:

√[(x-10)² + (y)²] = 5 → (x-10)² + y² = 25 ...(1)

From BC=9, the distance between B(x,y) and C(0,0) is
