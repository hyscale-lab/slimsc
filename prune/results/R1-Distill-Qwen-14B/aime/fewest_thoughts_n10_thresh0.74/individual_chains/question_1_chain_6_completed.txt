Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (xy).

Similarly, let's go back to equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z from equation (z), so let's substitute that.

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Compute 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's note this as equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy), x y = 2^(-2/3). But from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12), so substitute that into (xy):

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which is x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Solve for x^2:

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

Thus, x = 2^(-7/24), since square root of 2^(-7/12) is 2^(-7/24). So x is 2^(-7/24). Let me write that as equation (x).

Now, with x known, we can find y from equation (y). So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y = 2^(-3/8). Equation (y).

Similarly, z is already known from equation (z): z = 2^(-5/12).

So now, I have x, y, z in terms of powers of 2.

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-3/8)
z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me write all exponents with denominator 24 to make it easier:

x: exponent is -7/24
y: exponent is -3/8 = -9/24
z: exponent is -5/12 = -10/24

So:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-9/24)
z = 2^(-10/24)

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let me compute the exponent inside the log first.

x^4 y^3 z^2 = (2^(-7/24))^4 * (2^(-9/24))^3 * (2^(-10/24))^2

Compute each term:

(2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)
(2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-9/24 * 3) = 2^(-9/8)
(2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-10/24 * 2) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

So multiplying all together:

x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Add the exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, find common denominators. Let's convert all to 24ths.

-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them:

-28 -27 -20 = -75 → -75/24

Simplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Both divisible by 3.

-75 ÷ 3 = -25; 24 ÷3 = 8. So -25/8.

So x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)

So log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So the value is 25/8. Now, 25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³; no common factors.

Thus, m =25, n=8. m +n=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

1. \(\sqrt{2} = \frac{x}{yz}\) which gives \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\)
2. \(2^{1/3} = \frac{y}{xz}\) which gives \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(2^{1/4} = \frac{z}{xy}\) which gives \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Substituting these into each other, we find:

- From \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) and \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\), we substitute \(y\) into the first equation:
  \[
  x = (xz \cdot 2^{1/3}) z \sqrt{2} \implies x = xz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}
  \]
  Solving for \(z\), we get \(z = 2^{-5/12}\).

- Using \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) in \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\), we find:
  \[
  2^{-5/12} = xy \cdot 2^{1/4} \implies xy = 2^{-2/3}
  \]

- Substituting \(z\) into \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\), we get:
  \[
  y = x \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/3} \implies y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}
  \]

- Using \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\) and \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\), we solve for \(x\):
  \[
  x \cdot (x \cdot 2^{-1/12}) = 2^{-2/3} \implies x^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-2/3} \implies x^2 = 2^{-7/12} \implies x = 2^{-7/24}
  \]

- Finally, substituting \(x\) into \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\), we get:
  \[
  y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-3/8}
  \]

Now, we have:
- \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)
- \(y = 2^{-3/8}\)
- \(z = 2^{-5/12}\)

We need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (2^{-7/24})^4 \cdot (2^{-3/8})^3 \cdot (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6}
\]

Adding the exponents:
\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8}\), and the absolute value is \(\frac{25}{8}\).

The value of \(m + n\) where \(\frac{25}{8}\) is in lowest terms is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
