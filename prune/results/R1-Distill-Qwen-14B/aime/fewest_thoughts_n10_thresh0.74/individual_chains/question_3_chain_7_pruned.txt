Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Alright, the setup is that Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. But if all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. But since if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize (because all four matching implies at least two match), A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to calculate two probabilities: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize.

Let me break this down. First, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10,4). Let me compute that. C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible combinations.

Winning the grand prize means that all four of Jen's numbers are the same as the four chosen. There's only one such combination, so the number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is 1. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize P(A) is 1/210.

Next, the probability of winning a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers match the four chosen. Hmm, how do I calculate that?

Well, sometimes it's easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of winning a prize is not winning a prize, which would be when she has fewer than two matching numbers, i.e., zero or one matching numbers.

So, the number of ways she can have zero matches: that's the number of ways to choose all four numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). That's C(6,4) = 15.

The number of ways she can have exactly one match: choose 1 number from her 4, and 3 from the remaining 6. That's C(4,1)*C(6,3). Let's compute that. C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20=80.

So, total number of ways she doesn't win a prize is 15 + 80 = 95. Therefore, the number of ways she does win a prize is total combinations minus non-winning combinations: 210 - 95 = 115.

Therefore, the probability P(B) is 115/210. Let me reduce that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, it's 23/42.

Wait, hold on. Let me cross-verify. If she has exactly two, three, or four matches, she wins a prize. So, maybe it's better to compute directly the number of ways she can have exactly two, three, or four matches and sum them up.

So, for exactly two matches: C(4,2) ways to choose the two matching numbers, and then C(6,2) ways to choose the other two from the non-matching. So, that's 6 * 15 = 90.

For exactly three matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 *6=24.

For exactly four matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1=1.

Adding these up: 90+24+1=115, which matches the previous result. So, P(B) is 115/210 = 23/42.

Thus, P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115. Wait, that's 1 over 115? Let me check.

Wait, P(A) is 1/210 and P(B) is 115/210. So, when you divide them, (1/210)/(115/210) simplifies to (1/210)*(210/115) = 1/115. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, 1/115 is in its simplest form because 1 and 115 share no common divisors besides 1. So, m is 1 and n is 115, so m + n = 116.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating P(B). Because sometimes when dealing with conditional probabilities, especially in lotteries, it's easy to get confused between combinations and such.

So, another way to think about it: the number of possible ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is C(10,4)=210, correct. Jen has a specific set of 4 numbers. The number of ways that the lottery's 4 numbers can intersect with hers in at least two numbers.

Which is the same as the number of 4-number combinations that share at least two numbers with Jen's set. So, another way is to use inclusion-exclusion.

Number of ways with at least two matches = total combinations - combinations with fewer than two matches.

Which is exactly what I did earlier, so that's consistent.

Wait, so another way could be to compute it directly as the sum of exactly two, three, and four matches, which I did and got 115. So, that's correct.

So, P(B) is 115/210 = 23/42. And P(A) is 1/210.

So, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/1
