Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand and figure it out step by step.

First, the hyperbola equation is given as (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. The standard form is (x²/a²) - (y²/b²) = 1, so here a² is 20 and b² is 24. So, a = sqrt(20) and b = sqrt(24). That might come in handy later.

Now, the points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, interesting. So, the origin is the intersection point of the diagonals, which in a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin.

Since the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, points A and C are opposite each other, and similarly, B and D are opposite each other. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y), right? Similarly, B would be (p, q), and D would be (-p, -q).

But wait, since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal. That is, all sides AB, BC, CD, DA are equal in length. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, and so on.

Alternatively, another property of a rhombus is that its diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1. But wait, in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, so if one diagonal is AC with slope m, the other BD should have slope -1/m.

But maybe I should approach this using coordinates.

Let me assume that points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other. Since diagonals bisect each other, the midpoint of AC is the origin, same with BD.
