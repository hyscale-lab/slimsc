Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

Now, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and the diagonals cross each other there. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, hold on, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. Because in a rhombus, which is a special kind of parallelogram, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, yeah, that's a key property.

So, given that, the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

Wait, so the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Since the rhombus is convex, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is (x, y), then the opposite point C would be (-x, -y), because the diagonals bisect each other at the origin. Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D would be (-p, -q). So, the four points would be (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, each of them must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Similarly for (p, q): p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Now, the rhombus has sides AB, BC, CD, DA, all equal in length. So, the distance between A and B must
