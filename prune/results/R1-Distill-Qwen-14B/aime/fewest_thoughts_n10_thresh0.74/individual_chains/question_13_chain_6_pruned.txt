Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me read it again carefully and try to understand what it's asking.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s + 2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, if she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, how many minutes will her walk take, including the t minutes in the coffee shop?

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to figure out the values of s and t, right? Because once we have those, we can calculate the time it takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me break it down. First, when walking at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, which includes the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop. Similarly, when her speed is s + 2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours or 2 hours plus 24 minutes.

Wait, but how is the total time related to the walking time and coffee time? I think the total time is the sum of the time she spends walking and the time she spends in the coffee shop. So, if I denote the walking time as Tw and coffee time as Tc, then total time T = Tw + Tc.

But the problem says that the total time includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, maybe t is the coffee shop time in minutes, and the rest is walking time.

Wait, let me clarify. The first scenario: speed s, total time 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the total time is 4 hours, which is 4*60=240 minutes. So, walking time is 240 - t minutes.

Similarly, in the second scenario: speed s+2, total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2*60 +24=144 minutes. So, walking time is 144 - t minutes.

But wait, this might not
