Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer should be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then I need to find p+q.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I remember that the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is determined by the box's space diagonal. The space diagonal of the box will be the diameter of the sphere, so the radius will be half of that diagonal.

So, if I can find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, then I can find the radius. Wait, but actually, the sphere has to contain each box, so the radius must be large enough to contain even the box with the largest space diagonal in B. But is there a maximum to the space diagonal given the constraints on surface area and volume? Or maybe all boxes in B have the same space diagonal? That seems unlikely because different box dimensions can give the same surface area and volume but different space diagonals.

Wait, no. For a given surface area and volume, the shape of the box can vary, affecting the space diagonal. So, to find the minimal sphere that can contain all such boxes, we must find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B. So, the sphere's radius will be half of this maximum diagonal.

But how do I find the maximum space diagonal? Let me recall that the space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, I need to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

The surface area S of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume V is xyz = 23.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² under the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm. Maximizing x² + y² + z² given these constraints. This seems like a problem that can be approached using Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a smarter way since we’re dealing with symmetric functions.

Let me think about the relationships here. Let me denote:

Let’s denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz, and Q = xyz.

Wait, we know P and Q. From the given, 2P = 54, so P = 27, and Q = 23.

We also know that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P. Because (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = S² - 54.

So, our goal is to maximize x² + y² + z², which is equivalent to maximizing S², since 54 is a constant.

Therefore, maximizing S² will maximize x² + y² + z². So, how can I maximize S² given that P = 27 and Q = 23?

Alternatively, since S² is to be maximized, and S is x + y + z, I can think of this as an optimization problem where I need to maximize S with the constraints P = 27 and Q = 23.

Hmm, I remember that for fixed P and Q, the sum S can vary. To find the maximum S, I might need to use Lagrange multipliers with the constraints.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. Let’s define variables x, y, z, and we want to maximize f(x,y,z) = x + y + z, subject to the constraints g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz = 27 and h(x,y,z) = xyz = 23.

The Lagrangian would be:

L = x + y + z - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0
∂L/∂y = 1 - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 1 - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27
xyz = 23

So, from the partial derivatives, we get the system of equations:

1 = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)   ...(1)
1 = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)   ...(2)
1 = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)   ...(3)

Hmm, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

0 = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(xz - yz)
=> 0 = λ(x - y) + μ z (x - y)
=> (x - y)(λ + μ z) = 0

So, either x = y or λ + μ z = 0.

Similarly, subtracting equation (1) from equation (3):

0 = λ(x + y - y - z) + μ(xy - yz)
=> 0 = λ(x - z) + μ y (x - z)
=> (x - z)(λ + μ y) = 0

So, either x = z or λ + μ y = 0.

Similarly, subtracting equation (2) from equation (3):

0 = λ(x + y - x - z) + μ(xy - xz)
=> 0 = λ(y - z) + μ x (y - z)
=> (y - z)(λ + μ x) = 0

So, either y = z or λ + μ x = 0.

Now, if we assume that x = y = z, then all three are equal. Let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then the surface area is 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. Then, the volume would be x³ = 27. But in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube case is not applicable here.

Therefore, x, y, z cannot all be equal. So, perhaps two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let me assume that x = y ≠ z.

So, let’s set x = y. Then:

From the surface area constraint: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 2(x² + 2xz) = 54 => x² + 2xz = 27.

From the volume constraint: x² z = 23.

So, we have:

x² + 2xz = 27   ...(a)
x² z = 23        ...(b)

Let me solve for z from equation (b):

z = 23 / x².

Substitute into equation (a):

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27
x² + (46)/x = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x
x³ -27x +46 = 0

Hmm, solve cubic equation x³ -27x +46 = 0.

Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Test x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 → 0. So, x=2 is a root.

So, (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0.

Therefore, the roots are x=2, and x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

So, x = 2, or x = -1 + 2√6, or x = -1 -2√6. Since x must be positive, x = 2 or x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈3.898.

So, x=2 is a valid solution. Let's check the value when x=2.

From equation (b), z =23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, when x=y=2, z=5.75.

So, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²) = sqrt(4 +4 + (5.75)^2) = sqrt(8 + 33.0625) = sqrt(41.0625)=6.408... Hmm, but is this the maximum?

Wait, let me check the other solution x = -1 +2√6. Let's compute that:

x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈3.898.

Then, z =23/(x²) ≈23/( (3.898)^2 )≈
