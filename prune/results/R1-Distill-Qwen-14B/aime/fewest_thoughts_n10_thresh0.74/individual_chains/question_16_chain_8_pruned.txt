Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I think I need to find primes p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. Since we're dealing with primes, maybe I can start by checking small primes and see if any of them satisfy this condition.

Starting with p=2: Let's see, n⁴ +1. For n=1, 1+1=2. 2 mod 4 is 2, which is not 0. So 2²=4 doesn't divide 2. Next, n=2: 16+1=17, which mod 4 is 1. Not 0. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next prime is p=3. Let's compute n⁴ +1 mod 9. For n=1: 1+1=2. Not 0. n=2: 16+1=17 mod 9 is 8. n=3: 81+1=82 mod 9 is 1. n=4: 256+1=257 mod 9. 257 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, so 257-252=5. Not 0. n=5: 625+1=626. 626/9 is 69*9=621, remainder 5. Hmm, not working. Maybe p=3 is not the one.

Moving on to p=5. Let's see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25 has a solution. Let's try n from 1 to 24, since mod 25 cycles every 25 numbers.

n=1: 1+1=2 mod25=2≠0
n=2: 16+1=17 mod25=17≠0
n=3: 81+1=82 mod25=82-3*25=82-75=7≠0
n=4: 256+1=257 mod25=257 -10*25=7
Wait, 257 mod25: 25*10=250, 257-250=7. So same as n=4 is 7 mod25.

n=5: 625+1=626 mod25. 625 is 25², so 625 mod25=0, 626 mod25=1. Not 0.

n=6: 6^4=1296. 1296 mod25: 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 mod25: 25*96=2400, so 2401 mod25=1. 1+1=2≠0.

n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod25: 25*163=4075, 4096-4075=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=9: 9^4=6561. 6561 mod25. 25*262=6550, 6561-6550=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=10: 10^4=10000. 10000 mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=11: 11^4=14641. 14641 mod25: 25*585=14625, 14641-14625=16. 16+1=17≠0.

n=12: 12^4=20736. 20736 mod25: 25*829=20725, 20736-20725=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=13: 13^4=28561. 28561 mod25: 25*1142=28550, 28561-28550=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=14: 14^4=38416. 38416 mod25: 25*1536=38400, 38416-38400=16. 16+1=17≠0.

n=15: 15^4=50625. 50625 mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=16: 16^4=65536. 65536 mod25: 25*2621=65525, 65536-65525=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=17: 17^4=83521. 83521 mod25: 25*3340=83500, 83521-83500=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=18: 18^4=104976. 104976 mod25: 25*4199=104975, 104976-104975=1. 1+1=2≠0.

n=19: 19^4=130321. 130321 mod25: 25*5212=130300, 130321-130300=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=20: 20^4=160000. mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=21: 21^4=194481. mod25: 25*7779=194475, 194481-194475=6. 6+1=7≠0.

n=22: 22^4=234256. mod25: 25*9370=234250, 234256-234250=6. 6+1=7≠0.

n=23: 23^4=279841. mod25: 25*11193=279825, 279841-279825=16. 16+1=17≠0.

n=24: 24^4=331776. mod25: 25*13271=331775, 331776-331775=1. 1+1=2≠0.

n=25: 25^4=390625. mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.

Wait, so none of the n from 1 to 25 satisfy n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. Hmm, so p=5 doesn't work either. Maybe I made a mistake? Or maybe p=5 is not the prime we're looking for.

Wait, another thought: maybe p=5 is possible because 5 is known to divide n⁴ +1 for certain n. Let me check. If n=2: 16+1=17, which is 2 mod5. Not 0. n=3: 81+1=82, which is 2 mod5. Hmm, maybe n=7? 7^4=2401. 2401 mod5: 2400 is 5*480, so 2401 mod5=1. 1+1=2≠0. Wait, maybe p=5 isn't possible either.

Wait, maybe 5 is too small. Maybe I should try the next prime, p=13. Wait, why
