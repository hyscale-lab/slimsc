Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to find the largest four-digit number N. So N is a number between 1000 and 9999. The key property here is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for every digit in N, replacing it with 1 should result in a number that's a multiple of 7.

Let me represent N as a four-digit number: let's say N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits, with A not zero because it's a four-digit number.

So when we change any one digit to 1, we get a new number. For example, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, and so on for C and D. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

I need to find the largest such N. So maybe I should start from 9999 and go downwards, checking each number to see if it satisfies this condition. But that seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the conditions each digit must satisfy.

Let's denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we replace the first digit A with 1, the number becomes 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. This must also be divisible by 7.

Replacing C with 1: AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Divisible by 7.

Replacing D with 1: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Also divisible by 7.

So each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7. So, I can write these as four separate congruences modulo 7.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then, the modified numbers are:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. Let's call this condition (1).
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. Condition (2).
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7. Condition (3).
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. Condition (4).

So I have four congruences. Maybe I can express each of them in terms of N and the original digits, and find some relationships.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express each modified number in terms of N. Let's see.

The modification of replacing a digit with 1 can be thought of as subtracting the original digit's value and adding 1 in that position.

For example, replacing A with 1: the value becomes N - (A*1000) + 1*1000.

Similarly, replacing B with 1: N - (B*100) + 1*100.

Replacing C with 1: N - (C*10) + 1*10.

Replacing D with 1: N - D + 1.

Each of these must be divisible by 7. So,

1. N - (A*1000) + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7.
2. N - (B*100) + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7.
3. N - (C*10) + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7.
4. N - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, I can write each of these as:

1. N ≡ (A*1000 - 1000) mod 7
2. N ≡ (B*100 - 100) mod 7
3. N ≡ (C*10 - 10) mod 7
4. N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, for the first condition: N - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, N ≡ 1000A - 1000 mod 7.

Similarly, N - 100B + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7 → N ≡ 100B - 100 mod 7.

Same for the others. So yes, each condition gives a congruence for N modulo 7.

But since all four conditions must hold, N must satisfy all four congruences. So, let me compute each of these modulo 7.

First, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7.

1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 ÷ 7. 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6 → 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98 → 100-98=2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7: 3*7=21, 10-7=3 → 10≡3 mod7.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite each condition using these:

1. N ≡ (6A - 6) mod7. Because 1000A mod7 is 6A, and 1000 mod7 is 6, so 6A -6.

2. N ≡ (2B - 2) mod7.

3. N ≡ (3C - 3) mod7.

4. N ≡ (D - 1) mod7.

But N must satisfy all four congruences, so
