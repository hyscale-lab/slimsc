Okay, so I've got this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help. Let me recall the change of base formula and other log properties. The change of base formula is log_b(a) = log_c(a)/log_c(b), right? And also, log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). Maybe these can be useful here.

So, starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Let's see, using the power rule, that can be rewritten as x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, because log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y). So, that simplifies to x times log base x of y equals 10.

Wait, log base x of y is the same as (ln y)/(ln x), right? Using the change of base formula. So, substituting that in, we get x * (ln y / ln x) = 10. Let me write that down:

x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can write this as (ln y) / (ln x) = 10 / x. Let me note that as equation (1).

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, 4y times log base y of x equals 10.

Similarly, log base y of x is (ln x)/(ln y). Substituting that in, we get 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10. Let me write that as:

4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10.

Again, this can be rearranged to (ln x)/(ln y) = 10 / (4y). Simplifying 10/(4y) to 5/(2y), so equation (2) is (ln x)/(ln y) = 5/(2y).

Wait a second, equation (1) was (ln y)/(ln x) = 10/x, and equation (2) is (ln x)/(ln y) = 5/(2y). Hmm, notice that (ln y)/(ln x) is the reciprocal of (ln x)/(ln y), so these two equations are connected.

If I take the reciprocal of equation (1), I get (ln x)/(ln y) = x/10. But from equation (2), (ln x)/(ln y) is also equal to 5/(2y). So, setting them equal:

x/10 = 5/(2y).

That seems promising. Let me write that as:

x / 10 = 5 / (2y).

Solving for one variable in terms of the other. Let's cross-multiply:

x * 2y = 10 * 5.

So, 2xy = 50.

Divide both sides by 2: xy = 25.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, does that mean the product xy is 25? That seems too easy. Let me double-check.

I had from the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10. Which becomes x log_x(y) =10. So, log_x(y) =10/x.

From the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) =10. Which becomes 4y log_y(x)=10. So, log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y).

But log_y(x) is equal to 1 / log_x(y
