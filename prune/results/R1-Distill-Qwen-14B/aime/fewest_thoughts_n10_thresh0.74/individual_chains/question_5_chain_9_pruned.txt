Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. There are eight circles of radius 34 that are sequentially tangent, and two of them are tangent to sides AB and BC. Then, it says that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. There are eight circles arranged in a sequence, each tangent to the next. Two of these circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of the triangle. So, maybe these circles are part of some chain along the sides of the triangle. Since all the circles have the same radius, 34, and are tangent to each other, the distance between their centers should be 2 * 34 = 68 units.

Wait, but if two of them are tangent to AB and BC, perhaps these are part of a larger arrangement, maybe similar to an incircle or something. But the inradius is going to be related to the size of the triangle, so maybe the way the circles are arranged can help me find the inradius.

Then, the problem mentions that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. That probably means that the pattern is scaled down by a factor. Since the radii are 34 and 1, the scaling factor would be 34, right? Because 34 is 34 times 1.

So, perhaps the configuration of the circles is similar, just scaled by 34. Therefore, the inradius of the triangle when the circles are radius 34 would be 34 times the inradius when the circles are radius 1.

Wait, but the inradius is a linear measure, so scaling by 34 would scale the inradius by 34 as well. So if I can find the inradius for the smaller case (radius 1), then multiply it by 34 to get the inradius for the original problem.

But how?

Let me think. If I have 2024 circles of radius 1 arranged in the same manner, how does that relate to the triangle? If each circle is tangent to the next, the number of circles along each side would determine the length of the side.

Wait, but the number of circles might depend on how they're arranged along the sides. Since two circles are
