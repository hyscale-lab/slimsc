Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the elements of set A. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm. Let me break this down. So Bob is considering all finite, nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in A. Each set B can have any positive integers, but the largest one must be an element of A.

Wait, so for example, if A is {2,3}, then possible sets B could be {2}, {3}, {2,3}, {2,4}, but wait, no, because the maximum has to be in A. So if B is {2,4}, then the maximum is 4, which isn't in A. So that set wouldn't be included. Got it.

So Bob is considering all finite nonempty subsets of the positive integers where the maximum is in A. The count of these sets is 2024. I need to find the sum of elements in A.

I think I need to figure out how the number of such sets B relates to the elements of A. Maybe if I can find a formula for the number of sets B given A, I can set that equal to 2024 and solve for A.

Let's think about how many sets B exist for a given A. Suppose A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, where a1 < a2 < ... < an. Then, for each element ai in A, how many sets B have maximum ai?

If the maximum is ai, then the other elements of B must be less than ai. So for each ai, the number of possible nonempty sets B with maximum ai is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, excluding the empty set, and then including ai.

Wait, the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} is 2^{ai-1}. Since B is nonempty, the number of possible subsets for the elements less than ai is 2^{ai-1} - 1 (excluding the empty set). Then, each of these subsets can be combined with ai to form a set B where the maximum is ai. So for each ai, there are (2^{ai-1} - 1) sets B with maximum ai.

But wait, no. Because B is a set, so the elements must be unique. So for each ai, the number of possible B's where the maximum is ai is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, which can be any subset (including empty?), but wait, B must be nonempty. So for each ai, the number of possible B's is the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} plus 1 (for the set {ai} itself). Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, actually, the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} is 2^{ai-1}, including the empty set. But since B must
