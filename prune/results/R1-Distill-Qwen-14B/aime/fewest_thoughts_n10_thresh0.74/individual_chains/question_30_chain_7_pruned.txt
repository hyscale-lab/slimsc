Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about roots of unity and products. Let's see what it says again.

It says: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ) is divided by 1000.

Hmm. So I need to compute the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ) and then find the remainder when that product is divided by 1000.

First, I should recall what a 13th root of unity is. The 13th roots of unity are the complex numbers satisfying the equation ω¹³ = 1. Since ω ≠ 1, we're dealing with the primitive roots. There are φ(13) = 12 primitive 13th roots, where φ is Euler's totient function.

But wait, in this problem, k goes from 0 to 12, so ω⁰ is 1 as well. So the product includes the term when k=0, which is (2 - 2*1 + 1²) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So that term is 1, but let me make sure.

Wait, when k=0, ω⁰ = 1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + (1)² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is indeed 1, so it doesn't affect the product. So maybe I can focus on the terms from k=1 to 12, but since the product is from 0 to 12, it's the same as multiplying all those terms including k=0 which is 1.

But maybe that's not particularly helpful. Let me think about how to approach the product.

The product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ). Let me denote ζ = ω, so ζ is a primitive 13th root of unity. So ζ¹³ = 1, and ζ^m ≠ 1 for 0 < m < 13.

So the product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ζ^k + ζ^{2k}).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression 2 - 2ζ^k + ζ^{2k} in a better way. Maybe rewrite the expression inside the product.

Let me compute 2 - 2ζ^k + ζ^{2k}.

Hmm, perhaps factor it as something like (a ζ^k + b)(c ζ^k + d), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe consider that 2 - 2ζ^k + ζ^{2k} is a quadratic in ζ^k.

Let me think: Let x = ζ^k, then the expression is 2 - 2x + x².

So, 2 -
