Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. Let me try to unpack this.

First, the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. That probably means that whatever rotation we consider, it's going to map vertices onto each other in a cyclic way.

Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability. So each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red and 1/2 of being blue.

We need the probability that there's some rotation such that all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, after rotation, for every blue vertex, the vertex it moves to was originally red.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase that. The problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. So, if we rotate the octagon, then each blue vertex moves to a position, and all those target positions were red before the rotation.

So effectively, this is saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Alternatively, it's like the blue set is a rotated version of the red set. So, perhaps the blue and red sets are in the same orbit under rotation.

Wait, another way to think about it: the coloring after rotation must swap all the blue and red vertices. So, if we have a rotation that maps each blue vertex to a red one, then the set of blue vertices is a translate (rotationally shifted) version of the set of red vertices.

But let me think more clearly.

Let’s denote the set of red vertices as R and blue as B. The problem is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation σ such that σ(B) = R. Because each blue is mapped to a red under σ.

Wait, but since the octagon is regular, the rotations form a group, so if σ(B) = R, then σ is a rotation by some multiple of 45 degrees, right? Since a regular octagon has 8 sides, each rotation is 45 degrees apart.

Since the octagon is regular, the group of rotations is cyclic of order 8. So, the possible
