Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, the total number of residents is 900. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one of the four items we're considering. The other three are diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. 

Let me list the numbers given:
- Diamond rings: 195 owners.
- Golf clubs: 367 owners.
- Garden spades: 562 owners.
- Candy hearts: Well, every resident owns this, so it's 900.

Then, we have some additional info:
- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.
- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.
- We need to find how many own all four.

Hmm. So this sounds like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections. But since we're dealing with exactly two and exactly three, I think we'll need to use some formula that accounts for those.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, in our case, every resident owns at least the candy hearts, so the union of all four is actually the entire 900 residents. Because everyone has at least one of the four items (specifically, candy hearts). So:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900.

So substituting into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, in the problem, the numbers given are |A|, |B|, |C|, which are the diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades owners. But each resident has the candy hearts, so |D| is 900.

So, let me note:
- A = diamond rings: 195
- B = golf clubs: 367
- C = garden spades: 562
- D = candy hearts: 900

So, substituting the known values:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - [sum of all pairwise intersections] + [sum of all triple intersections] - [all four intersections]

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me compute the sum of |A|
