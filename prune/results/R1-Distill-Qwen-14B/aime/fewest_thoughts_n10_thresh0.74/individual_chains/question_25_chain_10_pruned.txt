Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it out step by step. 

The problem says there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one item everyone has. Then there are other items: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

So, in terms of sets, I can think of these as four different sets: C (candy hearts, which is everyone), D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), and S (garden spade). 

The numbers given are:
- |D| = 195
- |G| = 367
- |S| = 562
- |C| = 900 (since everyone has this)

Additionally, it says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things and 234 who own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things, which would be |C ∩ D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. But it's a bit more complicated because we're dealing with four sets and some information about exactly two and exactly three overlaps.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula for the total number of elements in the union of four sets is:

|C ∪ D ∪ G ∪ S| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |C∩D| - |C∩G| - |C∩S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |C∩D∩G| + |C∩D∩S| + |C∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩S| - |C∩D∩G∩S|

But wait, the problem is that we don't know all the pairwise intersections, or the triple intersections. So maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, the problem does provide some other information. It says 437 own exactly two things, and 234 own exactly three. Also, all residents have the candy hearts, so the sets D, G, S are subsets of C.

Wait a minute, since everyone has candy hearts, the total number of people owning any combination is within C. So, the total number of people is 900, and they all have C, so all the other sets are subsets of C.

But maybe I can model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but considering exactly two and exactly three overlaps.

I remember that the formula for the total number of elements in the union of sets can also be expressed as the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the sum of the sizes of all two-set intersections plus the sum of all three-set intersections, and so on, alternating signs.

But here, we have specific numbers for exactly two and exactly three. So perhaps I can approach this by considering the counts of exactly two and exactly three overlaps.

Let me think
