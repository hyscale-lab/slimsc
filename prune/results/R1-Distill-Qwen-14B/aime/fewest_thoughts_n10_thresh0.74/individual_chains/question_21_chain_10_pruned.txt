Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it properly. So, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63. So, 6 + 3 equals 9, and the square root of 81 is 9. Makes sense. 

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b for which there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Hmm, okay. Let's break it down. 

First, n is a two-digit number in base b. So, in base 10, for example, a two-digit number is something like 10 to 99. Similarly, in base b, a two-digit number would be from b^1 to b^2 - 1. So, in general, a two-digit number in base b can be expressed as a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since the first digit can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

So, n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The next condition is that the sum of the two digits, a + c, must equal the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. Therefore, n must be a perfect square because the square root is an integer (as a and c are integers, their sum is an integer, and n is a positive integer). So, n = k^2, where k is a positive integer, and k = a + c.

So, putting it all together: n = a*b + c = k^2, and k = a + c. Therefore, we can write the equation:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me write that again:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me rearrange this equation. Let's subtract a*b + c from both sides to see if that helps, but maybe it's better to just reorganize terms. So,

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me denote (a + c) as k for simplicity. So, k^2 = a*b + c.

But since k = a + c, we can write c as k - a.

Substituting c into the equation:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a)

Simplify the right-hand side:

= a*b + k - a

= a*(b - 1) + k

So, the equation becomes:

k^2 = a*(b - 1) + k

Let me bring all terms to one side:

k^2 - k - a*(b - 1) = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange this equation to solve for a in terms of k and b.

Let me write it as:

a*(b - 1) = k^2 - k

Therefore,

a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Since a must be an integer (as it's a digit in base b), the right-hand side must be an integer. So, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). 

Also, remember that a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1, as it's a digit in the two-digit number. Similarly, c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1. So, c = k - a must be between 0 and b-1, inclusive.

So, let's list the constraints:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1
2. 0 ≤ c = k - a ≤ b - 1
3. a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) must be integer

So, to find the possible b, I think we can approach this by considering for each base b, find all possible k such that a is integer and within the required range, and c is also within the required range.

But since the problem asks for the minimal b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, perhaps we can find for each b, how many such n exist, and find the smallest b where that count exceeds 10.

So, let's think about how to model this.

Given that a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1), and a must be an integer, the denominator (b - 1) must divide the numerator (k^2 - k). So, (b - 1) | (k^2 - k).

Which implies that (b - 1) divides k(k - 1).

But since k = a + c, and a and c are digits in base b, with a from 1 to b-1, c from 0 to b-1, k can range from 1 + 0 = 1 to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.

So, k can be as small as 1 and as large as 2b - 2.

But n = k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which is between b and b^2 - 1. So,

b ≤ k^2 ≤ b^2 - 1.

Taking square roots,

sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1).

Which simplifies to,

sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ b - 1.

Wait, wait. Let me check that:

Wait, because k^2 must be less than or equal to b^2 - 1. So, k ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1).

But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is just slightly less than b. So, k is less than b. So, k can be at most b - 1. Because k is an integer. So, k is between sqrt(b) and b - 1, inclusive.

So, for each base b, the possible k values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

But since k must be at least 1, and sqrt(b) is at least sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, so k starts at 2 for b >= 2? Wait, no, for b=2, sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so k must be at least 2? Wait, no, because k can be 1 as sqrt(1) is 1, and for b=2, the two-digit numbers in base 2 are 10_2=2, 11_2=3. So, n can be 2 or 3. Then sqrt(2) is ~1.414, sqrt(3) is ~1.732, but k would be a + c. For n=2 in base 2, it's 10, so a=1, c=0, k=1+0=1. Then sqrt(2) isn't an integer, so n=2 isn't beautiful. Similarly, n=3 is 11 in base 2, so k=1+1=2. Then sqrt(3) is not equal to 2. So, for b=2, there are no beautiful numbers.

But let's get back. So, for each b, k must be an integer such that sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ b - 1, and additionally, (b - 1) divides k(k - 1), because (b-1) divides k^2 - k.

So, for each b, I can iterate over k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, and check if (b-1) divides k(k - 1). For each such k, compute a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1). Then, check if a is between 1 and b - 1, and c = k - a is between 0 and b - 1. If so, then n = a*b + c is a b-eautiful number.

So, for each base b, count how many such k satisfy these conditions.

Our goal is to find the smallest b where this count is more than 10.

So, perhaps we can approach this by starting from small b and increasing b until we find one with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.

But since the problem might have a large b, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula to compute the number of possible k for each b.

Alternatively, perhaps express the problem in terms of factors. Since (b - 1) must divide k(k - 1), and since k and k - 1 are consecutive integers (so coprime), then (b - 1) must divide the product of two consecutive integers. Therefore, (b - 1) can be expressed as a product of two coprime factors, d and e, such that d divides k and e divides k - 1, or vice versa.

Wait, so since k and k - 1 are coprime, any divisor of their product must be of the form d*e, where d divides k and e divides k - 1, and d and e are coprime.

Therefore, for (b - 1) = d*e, with d and e coprime, then d divides k and e divides (k - 1). So, k ≡ 0 mod d, and k ≡ 1 mod e.

This is a system of congruences, which can be solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), given that d and e are coprime.

So, for each factorization of (b - 1) into d*e with d and e coprime, we can find solutions k modulo (d*e), which is (b - 1).

But since k is in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1], which is a range of about b - sqrt(b), the number of solutions may vary depending on how many factorizations (d,e) exist for (b - 1).

Hmm. This seems a bit involved, but perhaps gives a way to count the number of solutions for each b.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:

Given that (b - 1) divides k(k - 1), so k(k - 1) is a multiple of (b - 1).

So, for each b, we can compute the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (b - 1) divides k(k - 1).

So, for each b, the number of such k is equal to the number of multiples of (b - 1) in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)) (k(k - 1)) , (b - 1)(b - 2)].

Wait, no, that's perhaps not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of possible k is equal to the number of divisors of (b - 1) times something. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about it differently. For each b, let's denote m = b - 1. So, m = b - 1.

Then, m divides k(k - 1). So, for each m, how many k in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m] satisfy that m divides k(k - 1).

Since m = b - 1, and b is at least 2, m is at least 1.

So, we can rephrase the problem as: for each m >= 1, find the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m] such that m divides k(k - 1).

Then, for each m, compute the number of such k, and then when m + 1 is our base b. So, our goal is to find the smallest m + 1 such that the number of such k for m is greater than 10.

So, perhaps we can model m as varying from 1 upwards, compute the number of k for each m, and then find the first m where this number exceeds 10, and then take b = m + 1.

This seems manageable.

So, let's formalize this:

For m = 1,2,3,...,

We need to find the number of integers k such that:

1. ceil(sqrt(m + 1)) ≤ k ≤ m

2. m divides k(k - 1)

Compute this count for each m until we find the first m where the count is >10, then set b = m + 1.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, understand how to compute, for each m, the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m] such that m divides k(k - 1).

Since m divides k(k - 1), which means that k(k - 1) ≡ 0 mod m.

So, k ≡ 0 mod d or k ≡ 1 mod e, where d and e are coprime factors of m, as earlier.

But perhaps another way is to note that k must satisfy either k ≡ 0 mod m or k ≡ 1 mod m.

Wait, because if m divides k(k - 1), then k ≡ 0 mod m or k ≡ 1 mod m.

Wait, is that necessarily true?

Wait, suppose m is not prime. Let's see.

Take m = 6. Then, 6 divides k(k - 1). Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one of them is even, and one of them must be divisible by 3. So, for m=6, the solutions are k ≡ 0 mod 2 and 0 mod 3, but that's not necessarily k ≡ 0 mod 6 or k ≡1 mod 6.

Wait, for m=6, let's test k=2: 2*1=2, which is not divisible by 6. k=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by 6. So, k=3 is a solution. Similarly, k=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 6. So, k=4 is a solution. k=5: 5*4=20, not divisible by 6. So, for m=6, the solutions are k=3 and 4.

Wait, so 3 ≡ 3 mod 6, 4 ≡4 mod 6. So, it's not necessarily that k ≡0 or 1 mod m. So, my earlier thought was wrong.

Therefore, the condition that m divides k(k - 1) doesn't necessarily imply k ≡0 or 1 mod m, except when m is prime.

Wait, when m is prime, say m=5. Then, m divides k(k-1) implies that either 5 divides k or 5 divides k-1. So, k ≡0 or 1 mod 5. So, for m=5, the solutions are k=5 or 1 mod 5.

Wait, but in our case, since k ≤ m, for m=5, k can be 1, 5.

But k must be at least ceil(sqrt(6))=3. So, k=5.

So, only one solution.

But for m=6, as above, there are two solutions: k=3 and 4.

So, in general, for composite m, the number of solutions can be more than two.

Therefore, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m minus something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better for each m, compute the number of
