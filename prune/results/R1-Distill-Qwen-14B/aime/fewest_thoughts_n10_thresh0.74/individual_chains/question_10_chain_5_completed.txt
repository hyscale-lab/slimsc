Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and we need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let me make sure I understand what Bob is doing. He's listing all finite, nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in Alice's set A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can form various sets B where a is the maximum. 

Wait, so if A is {a1, a2, ..., an}, then for each ai, the number of such sets B where ai is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, right? Because for each ai, the other elements in B have to be less than ai. So for each ai, the number of possible B sets with maximum ai is 2^{ai - 1}. Because each number less than ai can either be included or not, except we can't have an empty set since B must be non-empty. Wait, no, actually, each element less than ai can be either included or not, but since B has to be non-empty, for each ai, the number of possible B sets is 2^{ai - 1} minus 1? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, no. For a given ai, the maximum, the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}. So the number of subsets is 2^{ai - 1}. But since each B must be non-empty, but the maximum is fixed as ai, so in this case, the sets B can include ai and any combination of numbers less than ai, including the empty set. Wait, but B is a non-empty set. So if the maximum is ai, the set must contain ai and any subset of the numbers less than ai, including the empty subset. So the number of possible B sets for each ai is 2^{ai - 1}. Because for each element less than ai, it's either in or out, and we must include ai. So the total number of sets for each ai is 2^{ai - 1}.

So Bob's total number of sets is the sum over all ai in A of 2^{ai - 1}. And this sum is equal to 2024. So, mathematically, we can write:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of the elements of A, given this condition.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024. Then, once we find A, we compute the sum of its elements.

Hmm, okay. So, let's think about how to find such a set A.

First, 2024 is the sum of powers of two. Wait, 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048. So 2024 is between 2^10 and 2^11. Wait, but our sum is of terms like 2^{a-1}, each term being a power of two. So perhaps A is a set where each element a is such that 2^{a-1} is a power of two, and the sum of these is 2024.

Wait, but the sum of distinct powers of two would be like binary representation. But in this case, each term is 2^{a-1}, so each term is a power of two, but the exponents are a-1, where a is in A. So if A is a set of positive integers, each term is a power of two, but possibly with exponents not necessarily consecutive.

Wait, but the sum of these terms is 2024. Let me check what 2024 is in binary. Let's compute:

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0

1012 /2=506 rem 0

506/2=253 rem 0

253/2=126 rem 1

126/2=63 rem 0

63/2=31 rem1

31/2=15 rem1

15/2=7 rem1

7/2=3 rem1

3/2=1 rem1

1/2=0 rem1

So writing the remainders from bottom up: 11111101000.

Wait, let me count the digits:

Starting from the last division, the remainders are:

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0.

So that's 11 bits. So 2024 in binary is 11111101000.

Which is 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + ... Wait, wait, let's see, the binary digits are from highest to lowest:

Bit 10: 1 (1024)

Bit 9: 1 (512)

Bit8: 1 (256)

Bit7: 1 (128)

Bit6: 1 (64)

Bit5: 1 (32)

Bit4: 0 (16)

Bit3: 1 (8)

Bit2: 0 (4)

Bit1: 0 (2)

Bit0: 0 (1)

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to list the binary digits as per standard:

2024 in binary:

Let me compute 2024.

2^10 = 1024.

2024 - 1024 = 1000.

2^9 = 512. 1000 - 512 = 488.

2^8=256: 488-256=232.

2^7=128: 232-128=104.

2^6=64: 104-64=40.

2^5=32:40-32=8.

2^3=8: 8-8=0.

So the powers are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So 2024=2^10 +2^9 +2^8 +2^7 +2^6 +2^5 +2^3.

Therefore, 2024 = sum_{k=3,5,6,7,8,9,10} 2^k.

Wait, but in our problem, the sum is Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, 2^{a-1} for a in A must sum up to 2024.

Which is the same as Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, 2^{a-1} are the terms, each a power of two, and their sum is 2024, which is itself a sum of several powers of two.

So, perhaps each 2^{a-1} corresponds to a power of two in the binary representation of 2024. 

Wait, but 2024 is 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10.

So, 2^{a-1} must be equal to each of these terms.

So, for each term in the binary expansion, 2^{a-1} must equal one of these powers.

Therefore, 2^{a-1} = 2^k for some k, which implies a-1 = k, so a = k + 1.

So, for each k in {3,5,6,7,8,9,10}, a would be k+1, so a would be {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, let me check: If a = 4, then 2^{4-1}=8=2^3. So 8 is one of the terms in 2024. Similarly, a=6 would give 2^5=32, which is part of 2024. a=7:2^6=64, a=8:2^7=128, a=9:2^8=256, a=10:2^9=512, a=11:2^10=1024.

So, if A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, then the sum over 2^{a-1} is 8 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 2024. 

Wait, let me verify:

8 +32=40; 40+64=104; 104+128=232; 232+256=488; 488+512=1000; 1000+1024=2024. Yep, that adds up.

So, then A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. So the sum of the elements of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that: 4+6=10, +7=17, +8=25, +9=34, +10=44, +11=55.

Hmm, so the sum is 55.

Wait, but let me think again. Is this the only possible set A? Could there be another set A where the sum of 2^{a-1} is 2024?

Because 2024 is a sum of distinct powers of two, right? Because in binary, each bit is either 0 or 1, so the sum is unique. Therefore, the only way to express 2024 as a sum of powers of two is the way we did it. So A must be the set {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, and the sum is 55.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way. For example, could we have overlapping terms or something? But 2^{a-1} are powers of two, so each term is unique. Hence, the only way to get 2024 is to use exactly those powers, which correspond to a's being 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Hence, the sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.

So I think the answer is 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). The total number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements of \( A \).

For each element \( a \) in \( A \), the number of sets \( B \) where \( a \) is the maximum element is \( 2^{a-1} \). Therefore, the total number of sets \( B \) is the sum of \( 2^{a-1} \) for all \( a \) in \( A \):

\[
\sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024
\]

The binary representation of 2024 is \( 11111101000_2 \), which corresponds to the sum of powers of two:

\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3
\]

Each term \( 2^{a-1} \) must match these powers of two. Thus, \( a-1 \) corresponds to the exponents in the binary representation, so \( a \) is:

\[
a = 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
\]

The set \( A \) is therefore \( \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \). The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
