Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then z can be written as r * e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Since |z| is 4, that means z = 4e^{iθ}. So maybe expressing z in this polar form will help simplify the expression.

Let me try that. Let's write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because the reciprocal of e^{iθ} is e^{-iθ}, and 1/|z| is 1/4. So, substituting these into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately. First, compute (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}. Let's factor out the 4:

4*(75 + 117i) * e^{iθ} = [4*75 + 4*117i] * e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i) * e^{iθ}

Similarly, the second term is (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = [24 + 36i] * e^{-iθ}

So now, the expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm, I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me recall that for any complex number a + bi, Re(a + bi) = a. But here, I have two complex terms multiplied by e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}. I remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's write each term as a product:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

I need to compute these products and then add them together, then take the real part.

Let me compute the first product:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300*cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ
(Since i^2 = -1, so 468i^2 sinθ = -468 sinθ)

So, combining the real and imaginary parts:
Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i

Similarly, compute the second term:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + ( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ )i + 36 sinθ
(Since i^2 = -1, so -36i^2 sinθ = +36 sinθ)

So, real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

Now, adding the two products together:

First, add the real parts from both terms:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Then, add the imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i
= [300 sinθ -24 sinθ + 468 cosθ +36 cosθ]i
= (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)i

But since we only care about the real part of the entire expression, the imaginary part can be ignored. So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum real part, which is the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. So, this is an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, but in this case, it's A cosθ - B sinθ. Wait, actually, in general, any expression of the form C cosθ + D sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is R, which is sqrt(C^2 + D^2). So, perhaps I can compute R here.

Wait, let me make sure. For an expression like a cosθ + b sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(a² + b²). So, if I have something like a cosθ - b sinθ, that's equivalent to a cosθ + (-b) sinθ, so the maximum is still sqrt(a² + b²).

So in this case, a is 324 and b is 432. Therefore, the maximum value should be sqrt(324² + 432²).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared. Let me see: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300² is 90000, and 24² is 576. Then, (300 +24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 +24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400² is 160,000. 32² is 1024. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 +32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600 +1,024 is 186,624.

So, adding 324² and 432²: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600). Let me compute that. Hmm, sqrt(291600).

Well, sqrt(291600) = sqrt(2916 * 100) ) = sqrt(2916) * sqrt(100) = sqrt(2916)*10.

What's sqrt(2916)? Let me think. 50² is 2500, 54² is 2916 because 50²=2500, 51²=2601, 52²=2704, 53²=2809, 54²=2916. Yes, so sqrt(2916)=54. Hence, sqrt(291600)=54*10=540.

So, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because I think I might have made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, yes, that's of the form a cosθ + b sinθ, with a=324 and b= -432.

But when we compute sqrt(a² + b²), it's sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324² + 432²) which is sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. So, yes, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I should verify whether this is indeed the case. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider writing 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324² + 432²). The maximum value of this expression is R, because the cosine function varies between -1 and 1.

So, yes, the maximum real part is R, which is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in the algebra.

So, starting from the beginning:

Expression is (75+117i) z + (96+144i)/z, with |z|=4.

Express z as 4 e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Then, (75+117i)*4 e^{iθ} + (96+144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}

Compute (75*4, 117*4): 300, 468. So, 300 + 468i.

Similarly, (96/4=24, 144/4=36). So, 24 + 36i.

Thus, expression becomes (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Expanding each term:

First term: 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ +468i² sinθ.

Which is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + (300 sinθ +468 cosθ) i.

Second term: 24 cosθ + 24i (-sinθ) + 36i cosθ +36 i² (-sinθ).

Wait, let me recompute the second term:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ.

Which is 24 cosθ +36 sinθ + (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ) i.

So, real parts are 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary parts are (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ) i.

So when adding both terms, real parts are:

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = (324 cosθ -432 sinθ).

Yes, that's correct.

So the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which is as I had earlier.

So, the maximum value is sqrt(324^2 +432^2) = 540.

So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 324 and 432 as multiples of a common factor. Let's see: 324 divided by 108 is 3, 432 divided by 108 is 4. So, 324=108*3, 432=108*4. So, expression is 108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ).

Hmm, wait, but 3 cosθ -4 sinθ can be written as 5 cos(θ + φ), since 3² +4²=25, so sqrt(25)=5. So, 3 cosθ -4 sinθ=5 cos(θ + φ), so the maximum is 5.

But wait, 108*5=540. So, that's another way to see it.

So, the maximum is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting this into the expression, we rewrite it as:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying each term:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding these using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we compute the real parts:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

This is of the form \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), whose maximum value is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Calculating:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
