Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to break it down and figure out how to approach it.

First, the hexagon is convex and equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal in length, and all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, that sounds like a regular property, but since it's just equilateral and not necessarily regular, the angles might vary.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. The goal is to find the side length of the hexagon.

Wait, the sides AB, CD, EF are being extended to form a triangle. So, each side of this triangle is formed by extending one of these sides until they meet. Since the hexagon is convex and the opposite sides are parallel, perhaps these extensions will form a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

I think drawing a diagram might help, but since I can't draw right now, I'll try to visualize it. Let's say the hexagon is labeled ABCDEF in order, so opposite sides are AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in a hexagon, opposite sides would be AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA. Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm: in a hexagon, each side has an opposite side across the center, so yes, AB opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, CD opposite to FA.

But the problem says that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend AB, CD, and EF until they meet, they form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. My goal is to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, perhaps I can model this using similar triangles or coordinate geometry. Let me think about coordinate geometry because I can assign coordinates to the hexagon vertices and try to relate the extensions.

But maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors or affine transformations. Wait, another approach is to recognize that when you extend the sides
