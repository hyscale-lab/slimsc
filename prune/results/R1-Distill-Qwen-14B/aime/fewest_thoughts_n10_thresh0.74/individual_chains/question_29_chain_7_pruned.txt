Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what information I have and what I need to find.

First, the problem mentions two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. I know that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Also, it says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on the same straight line. Hmm, so E is somewhere between D and C, or maybe beyond? I'm not sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.

Next, it says that points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the circumference of the same circle. That might be important because there are some properties about cyclic quadrilaterals that could come into play here, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees or something about power of a point.

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch to visualize the problem. I imagine rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, AB is the longer side, making it a tall rectangle. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle, and D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E is somewhere on the same line as D, C, F.

Wait, since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their sides are perpendicular. So, if I have ABCD, sides AB and CD are 107 units, and sides BC and AD are 16 units. For rectangle EFGH, sides EF and GH are 184 units (since EF is given as 184) and sides FG and EH are 17 units.

Now, since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's assume that line is horizontal for simplicity. So, point D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, and point C is the opposite corner. Then E and F are points on the same line, with E between D and C, and F beyond C? Or maybe E is on the extension beyond D? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to each point to make things clearer. Let me try that.

Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is (0,0), then C would be at (107,0) because BC is 16, which would be the height. Wait, no, wait. Wait, AB is 107 and BC is 16, so AB is the length, BC is the width. So, if I place D at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to C is along the x-axis by AB, which is 107. So, point C would be at (107,0). Then, since BC is 16, moving up from C, point B would be at (107,16), and point A would be at (0,16). Wait, no, that can't be right because AB should be 107, but from A to B, if A is (0,16), then B would be at (107,16), so the distance AB is 107, which matches. CD would then be from (107,0) to (0,0), which is 107. Okay, so the coordinates are:

- A: (0,16)
- B: (10
