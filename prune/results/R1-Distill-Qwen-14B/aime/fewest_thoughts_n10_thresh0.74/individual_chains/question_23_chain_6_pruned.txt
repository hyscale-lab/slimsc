Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi \( ABCD \) on the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, for a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's right. So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, in this case, the rhombus is defined by four points \( A, B, C, D \) on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. That means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if point \( A \) is \( (x, y) \), then the opposite point \( C \) would be \( (-x, -y) \). Similarly, if point \( B \) is \( (a, b) \), then point \( D \) would be \( (-a, -b) \).

But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So,
