Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has some specific properties. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. I remember that O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter. So, they are two different centers of the triangle.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. The inradius is related to the area and semiperimeter, right? The formula is r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter.

And the circumradius R is given by the formula R = (a b c) / (4 A), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

Also, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? I think so. So, OI² = R² - 2 R r. Let me verify that. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, OI squared equals R squared minus 2 R times r.

Given that R is 13 and r is 6, so OI² would be 13² - 2*13*6. Let me calculate that: 169 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI is sqrt(13). Okay, that's useful.

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle ABC, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. That's an interesting condition.

I think I'll need to use coordinate geometry or vector methods to tackle this. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system would help. Let me think about how to set this up.

Alternatively, maybe trigonometric identities or triangle properties can be used. Let me consider the properties of the inradius and circumradius.

Wait, I also remember that in any triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles. Hmm, for example, the length of IA can be found using the formula IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB and IC can be expressed in terms of r and the angles.

Wait, let me check that. I think that the distance from the inradius to vertex A is IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Is that correct? Or is it something else? Let me recall. The inradius is the distance from I to the sides, but IA is the distance from I to A. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the length of the angle bisector or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use coordinates. Let's try that. Let me set up a coordinate system where point I is at the origin
