Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, interesting.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. An 8x8 grid is like a chessboard, right? So, moving from the lower left to the upper right would involve moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. The path length is 16 because you're making 8 moves in each direction, totaling 16 steps. So, each path is a sequence of right and up moves.

Now, the key point here is that the path changes direction exactly four times. So, normally, without any restrictions, the number of paths is the number of ways to arrange 8 rights and 8 ups, which is the combination C(16,8). But here, we have an additional constraint on the number of direction changes.

What does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Let me visualize it. Imagine starting at the corner, moving right, then up, then right, then up, etc. Each time the direction changes from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, if the path alternates directions every step, it would have many direction changes. But if it goes in one direction for several steps before turning, the number of direction changes decreases.

Wait, so if a path changes direction four times, how many segments does it consist of? Each direction change starts a new segment. So, if you start moving right, then change to up, that's two segments. Each change adds one more segment. So, four direction changes would result in five segments. Hmm, right? Because each change increments the number of segments by one.

So, the path is divided into five segments. Each segment is a consecutive sequence of steps in the same direction. Now, these segments alternate between right and up. So, if the path starts with a right move, the segments will be right, up, right, up, right, and so on. Similarly, if it starts with an up move, it alternates the other way.

Wait, but the path must go from lower left to upper right, so it must have both rights and ups. So, the first segment could be either right or up. But since it's an 8x8 grid, moving only right or only up would not reach the destination. So, the path must have at least one right and one up segment. So, the number of direction changes depends on how the path alternates between right and up.

Since we have four direction changes, the number of segments is five. So, whether the path starts with right or up, it will have five segments, alternating directions each time.

Let me consider two cases: paths that start with a right move and paths that start with an up move. Each case might have a different number of such paths because the starting direction affects the arrangement of segments.

So, for each case, I can model the problem as arranging the number of steps in each segment. Let me formalize this.

Case 1: The path starts with a right move.

Then, the segments would be: right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, etc. But since we have only five segments, starting with right, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U, R. Wait, wait, no, because four direction changes mean five segments. So, starting with R, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. So, three right segments and two up segments. Wait, no, let me count.

Wait, the number of direction changes is four, so the number of segments is five. So, if starting with R, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R.
