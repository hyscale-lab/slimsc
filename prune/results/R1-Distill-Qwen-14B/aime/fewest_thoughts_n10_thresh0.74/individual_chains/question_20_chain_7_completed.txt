Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. I need to place some of them into a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that in each row, all the chips must be the same color, and the same goes for each column. Also, any additional chip would violate these conditions. I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let me break this down. Each row must have all chips of the same color, or none. Similarly, each column must have all chips of the same color, or none. But wait, the problem says "some of these chips," so it's possible that some rows or columns are empty. But wait, no, because each cell can have at most one chip, but if a row has at least one chip, all of them must be same color.

Wait, but if a row has some chips, they all must be the same color. Similarly for columns. Also, any additional chip would violate the conditions. So that probably means the placement is maximal; you can’t add any more chips without breaking the same-row or same-column color rule.

So, how do I model this? Each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. But wait, if a row is non-empty, all its chips must be the same color. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or empty.

But wait, the problem says that each cell contains at most one chip. So, if a row is all white, that means it's filled with white chips, but each cell can have at most one. So, a row can be either entirely white (5 white chips), entirely black (5 black chips), or empty. But same for columns. But wait, if a column is non-empty, all chips in that column must be the same color.

Wait, but this seems conflicting because if a row is all white and a column is all white, their intersection is a cell that's white. But if a row is white and a column is black, that cell can't have a chip, because it can't be both white and black. So, perhaps the grid must be colored in such a way that the intersections of rows and columns are consistent.

Wait, this seems like a grid where each row is assigned a color (white, black, or empty), each column is assigned a color (white, black, or empty), and the cell at (i,j) can have a chip only if row i and column j have the same color. Also, the color must be consistent across the row and column.

Wait, but if a row is white and a column is white, then the cell is white and can have a chip. If a row is white and a column is black, then the cell can't have a chip because it's neither. If a row is empty and a column is empty, the cell can't have a chip. If a row is empty and a column is white, then the cell can't have a chip because the row is empty. Similarly for column empty and row white.

So, the idea is that for each cell, the color of the row and column must agree. So, the grid is partitioned into blocks where each block is a rectangle where all the rows in that block are colored the same and all the columns in that block are colored the same.

Wait, another way to think about it is that the grid is divided into subgrids, each of which is a rectangle, and within each subgrid, all the cells have the same color, which is the color assigned to the rows and columns of that subgrid.

But how exactly do we model this? Let's think about it.

Each row can be assigned a color: white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be assigned a color: white, black, or empty. However, the assignments must be consistent in that for any cell (i,j), if row i is color C and column j is color D, then if C and D are the same (and non-empty), the cell can have a chip. Otherwise, the cell cannot have a chip.

But wait, the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip. So, the only way for a cell to have a chip is if both its row and column are assigned the same color (either white or black). So, the grid is effectively a union of rectangles where each rectangle corresponds to a color assignment. For each color, there's a set of rows and columns assigned to that color, and their intersection forms a rectangle where all the cells can have chips.

But wait, but in the problem, the placement is such that adding any chip would violate the conditions. So, that means that for any empty cell, either its row is already filled with a different color, or its column is filled with a different color, or both. So, the placement is maximal in the sense that no more chips can be added without causing a conflict.

Wait, so each row that is non-empty is either all white or all black, and same for each column. Moreover, the placement must be such that every empty cell is in a row that is either already monochromatic or in a column that's already monochromatic, but perhaps that's not necessary. Wait, no: the condition is that adding any chip would violate the conditions. So, if I have an empty cell, either the row is non-empty (i.e., already has chips of some color), or the column is non-empty (already has chips of some color). Because if neither the row nor the column is non-empty, then I could add a chip there without violating the row or column conditions, which would contradict the maximality.

Wait, so if a cell is empty, then at least one of its row or column must be non-empty. Because otherwise, adding a chip there would not violate any conditions, which is not allowed.

So, to model this: The grid must be such that every empty cell is in a row that is non-empty or in a column that is non-empty. So, the union of all non-empty rows and non-empty columns must cover the entire grid. But wait, no, because if a cell is empty, then either its row is non-empty or its column is non-empty. So, the empty cells must lie in rows that are non-empty or columns that are non-empty. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the grid in terms of which rows and columns are non-empty, and what colors they are.

Let me think: Let’s denote R as the set of non-empty rows, and C as the set of non-empty columns. Each non-empty row is either all white or all black, and each non-empty column is either all white or all black.

Moreover, for any non-empty row r, all the cells in row r must be the same color as row r's color, but also, if a column c is non-empty, then all the cells in column c must be the same color as column c's color.

But wait, for a cell (r,c) where r is in R and c is in C, the color assigned to row r must be the same as the color assigned to column c. Because otherwise, that cell can't have a chip, but if both row r and column c are non-empty, then the cell (r,c) must have a chip of that color.

Wait, no. If row r is assigned color W, and column c is assigned color B, then the cell (r,c) can't have a chip because the row and column would be conflicting. But if both are W, then the cell can have a white chip. So, the cell (r,c) can only have a chip if row r and column c have the same color.

But if row r is W, and column c is W, then cell (r,c) can have a chip. If row r is W and column c is B, then cell (r,c) can't have a chip. Similarly, if row r is B and column c is W, no chip. If both are B, then yes.

But since each non-empty row and non-empty column must be assigned a color, and for any cell (r,c) where both r and c are non-empty, the cell must have a chip only if r and c's colors agree. So, for such cells, the color must be the same.

Wait, but in the case where a row r is non-empty (say, color W) and column c is non-empty (color B), then the cell (r,c) can't have a chip. But this would mean that in that cell, you can't have a chip, but both the row and column are non-empty. So, that's allowed in the problem? Or is it not allowed?

Wait, the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip, but rows and columns must be monochromatic if non-empty. But if a row is non-empty (W) and a column is non-empty (B), their intersection can't have a chip because it would have to be both W and B, which is impossible. So, in that case, the cell (r,c) is empty, but row r and column c are non-empty. So, that is allowed, but the maximality condition comes into play: you cannot add any more chips without violating the conditions.

Wait, so in this scenario, if I have a row r (color W) and column c (color B), the cell (r,c) is empty, but if I try to add a chip there, it would violate the row or column condition, so that's okay. So, such a configuration is allowed.

But wait, if I have a grid where some rows are W, some are B, some are empty; same for columns. The cells where a W row and B column intersect are empty, but the rest are filled with W or B chips.

But the problem is that the placement must be such that adding any chip would violate the conditions. So, let's think about the empty cells.

An empty cell can be in three cases:

1. Both its row and column are empty. But in that case, adding a chip there would not violate any conditions, which is not allowed. So, such cells cannot exist.

Wait, but the problem states that any additional chip would violate the conditions, which means that every empty cell must be such that adding a chip there would violate the conditions. So, for every empty cell, either the row is non-empty (so adding a chip would cause the row to have mixed colors), or the column is non-empty (same reason), or both.

Wait, so every empty cell must be in a row that is non-empty or in a column that is non-empty. Because otherwise, if both the row and column are empty, you could add a chip there, which would violate the maximality condition.

So, in other words, the union of non-empty rows and non-empty columns must cover all the cells. So, every cell is either in a non-empty row or in a non-empty column. Because if a cell is in both an empty row and an empty column, then it could have a chip added, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the set of non-empty rows and non-empty columns must cover the entire grid. So, for every cell (i,j), either row i is non-empty or column j is non-empty.

So, the problem reduces to finding all possible assignments of colors to rows and columns where:

- Each non-empty row is either W or B.

- Each non-empty column is either W or B.

- For any cell (i,j), if row i and column j are both non-empty, then their colors must be the same.

Wait, no. Because if both row i and column j are non-empty, then cell (i,j) must have a chip, which must be of the same color as both row i and column j. So, the color assigned to row i must equal the color assigned to column j.

Alternatively, if row i is non-empty (color C) and column j is non-empty (color D), then C must equal D, because otherwise, cell (i,j) cannot have a chip, but both row i and column j are non-empty, which would imply that cell (i,j) must have a chip. So, that's a contradiction.

Wait, that seems like a problem. So, if row i is non-empty (color W), and column j is non-empty (color B), then cell (i,j) can't have a chip, but both the row and column are non-empty, meaning that cell (i,j) must have a chip. Contradiction. So, this can't happen. Therefore, for any non-empty row and column, their colors must be the same.

Therefore, all non-empty rows must have the same color, and all non-empty columns must have the same color, and this color must be consistent.

Wait, is that correct?

Suppose we have two non-empty rows: one W and one B. Then, if any column is non-empty, say W, then the intersection with the B row would cause a problem. Because the cell in B row and W column would require a chip, but the row is B and column is W, leading to a color conflict.

Therefore, all non-empty rows must have the same color, and all non-empty columns must have the same color, and the row color must equal the column color.

So, either:

- All non-empty rows are W, all non-empty columns are W.

- All non-empty rows are B, all non-empty columns are B.

Because if non-empty rows have different colors, you can't have any non-empty columns without causing a conflict. So, in other words, either:

1. All non-empty rows are white, and all non-empty columns are white.

2. All non-empty rows are black, and all non-empty columns are black.

Otherwise, if you have non-empty rows of different colors, you can't have non-empty columns without causing a conflict.

But wait, what if all non-empty rows are white, and all non-empty columns are white? Then, their intersections have white chips. Similarly, if all non-empty rows are black, and all non-empty columns are black.

Alternatively, could you have some non-empty rows of one color and some columns of another? It seems not, because it would lead to conflicts in the cells where they intersect.

Therefore, the only possibilities are:

- All non-empty rows are white, and all non-empty columns are white.

- All non-empty rows are black, and all non-empty columns are black.

Therefore, the grid is divided into four regions:

Top-left: rows and columns that are non-empty (all same color), and bottom-right: rows and columns that are empty.

Wait, let me think in terms of partitions. Let's say we have a set of rows R and a set of columns C. Both R and C are non-empty, and all rows in R are white, all columns in C are white. Then, the cells in R × C are white. The cells not in R or C are empty. The cells in R but not in C: their columns are empty, so they can have chips? Wait, no, because the columns are empty, but the rows are non-empty. So, in the cells (r,j) where r is in R and j is not in C, the column j is empty, so the cell can have a chip? Wait, no, because the row is non-empty, so all cells in row r must be the same color. But since column j is empty, the cell (r,j) can't have a chip, right?

Wait, no, if row r is non-empty (white), then all cells in row r must be white. But if column j is empty, then cell (r,j) would have to be white, but since column j is empty, that can't happen. So, that's a problem.

Wait, this suggests that if a row is non-empty, then all cells in that row must be of that color, but if the column is empty, then that cell can't have a chip. So, that's a conflict.

Therefore, if a row is non-empty, then all cells in that row must be either chips of the same color or empty. But if a column is empty, then all cells in that column must be empty. So, the only way for a row to be non-empty is if all the columns it intersects are non-empty as well. Similarly, a column can be non-empty only if all the rows it intersects are non-empty.

Wait, that seems restrictive. So, if any row is non-empty, then all columns must be non-empty, because otherwise, the cells in that row and empty column would have to be empty, but the row is non-empty, which requires all cells in that row to be the same color, which would require the column to be non-empty as well.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If a row is non-empty, say, white, then all cells in that row must be white. But if a column is empty, then all cells in that column must be empty. So, if a row is non-empty, the intersection of that row with any empty column would have to be empty, but the row requires the cell to be white. So, that's a conflict. Therefore, if any row is non-empty, all columns must be non-empty as well, and vice versa.

Similarly, if any column is non-empty, all rows must be non-empty.

Therefore, either:

1. All rows are non-empty and all columns are non-empty.

2. All rows are empty and all columns are empty.

But wait, but the problem states that you have to place some chips, so the case where all rows and columns are empty is not allowed.

Therefore, the only possibility is that all rows are non-empty and all columns are non-empty.

But wait, that can't be, because if all rows are non-empty, then each row has all white or all black chips. Similarly, each column is non-empty, all white or all black.

But as we thought earlier, the colors for rows and columns must be consistent. So, all non-empty rows must be the same color, and all non-empty columns must be the same color, and the row color must equal the column color.

Therefore, either:

- All rows are white, all columns are white.

- All rows are black, all columns are black.

Otherwise, if some rows are white and others are black, then columns would have to be both white and black, which is impossible.

Wait, but that can't be right either. For example, you could have some rows white and some black, but then the columns would have to be all white or all black, but that would cause conflicts in the cells where a white row intersects a black column.

Wait, but earlier we saw that if any row is non-empty, all columns must be non-empty, and if a column is non-empty, all rows must be non-empty.

But this leads to a problem where all non-empty rows must have the same color, and all non-empty columns must have the same color, which must be the same.

Therefore, in the maximal case, the only possibilities are:

1. All non-empty rows are white, all non-empty columns are white, so the intersection is all white chips.

2. All non-empty rows are black, all non-empty columns are black, so the intersection is all black chips.

But wait, but the number of white and black chips must be between 0 and 25 each, but the problem allows any number as long as it's within these limits, but the total placed chips can't exceed 25 white and 25 black.

Wait, but in this case, if I choose to have all non-empty rows as white and all non-empty columns as white, then the number of white chips is equal to the number of non-empty rows multiplied by the number of non-empty columns.

Similarly, if I choose black, the number of black chips is the product of non-empty rows and non-empty columns.

But wait, in this model, if I have a grid where all non-empty rows and columns are white, then the number of white chips is (number of non-empty rows) × (number of non-empty columns). Similarly for black.

But the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we can use any number of them as long as we don't exceed 25 each. But in the problem, we are to place some chips (so at least one), and any additional chip would violate the conditions.

Wait, but if all non-empty rows and columns are white, then the number of white chips is r*c, where r is the number of non-empty rows and c is the number of non-empty columns. Similarly, if all non-empty rows and columns are black, then the number of black chips is r*c.

But in the problem, we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we don't have to use all of them. We can use any number up to 25 for each.

Wait, but the problem says to place some chips, with each cell containing at most one. So, in the model where all non-empty rows and columns are white, the number of white chips is r*c, and the number of black chips is zero. Similarly, the other case would have black chips as r*c and white as zero.

But that can't be, because we can have both white and black chips. Wait, maybe not. Because if all non-empty rows and columns are white, then all white cells are in the intersection of non-empty rows and columns, and all other cells are empty. Similarly, if all non-empty rows and columns are black, same thing.

But if I have some rows assigned white, some assigned black, and same for columns, then their intersections would have to be of the same color, which may not be the same across the grid.

Wait, but earlier we saw that if a row is non-empty, all columns must be non-empty, and vice versa. So, perhaps the only possibilities are the entire grid is all white, all black, or a block in the corner.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Since each row must be monochromatic or empty, and each column must be monochromatic or empty, and the placement is maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips. Also, the union of non-empty rows and columns must cover the entire grid.

So, let's model the grid as a matrix where each cell is either W, B, or empty. Each row is either all W, all B, or all empty. Each column is either all W, all B, or all empty. Moreover, the placement is maximal, meaning that adding any chip would cause a row or column to have mixed colors.

So, how can such a grid look?

Option 1: All non-empty rows are W, all non-empty columns are W. So, the intersection is a rectangle of W chips. The rest of the grid is empty.

Option 2: All non-empty rows are B, all non-empty columns are B. Similarly, a rectangle of B chips.

Option 3: Some rows are W, some are B, and some columns are W, some are B, but in such a way that where a W row meets a W column, there's a W chip; where a B row meets a B column, there's a B chip; where a W row meets a B column, the cell is empty. But in this case, the non-empty rows and columns must form two separate blocks: one W block and one B block, but they can't overlap.

Wait, but the union of non-empty rows and columns must cover the entire grid. So, in this case, if we have some W rows and W columns, and some B rows and B columns, then their intersections would form two separate rectangles: one W block and one B block. But the rest of the grid would have to be covered by non-empty rows or columns. Wait, no, because the non-empty rows and columns must cover the entire grid.

Wait, let's say we have two sets of rows: R_w (white) and R_b (black). Similarly, two sets of columns: C_w (white) and C_b (black). Then, the cells (i,j) where i is in R_w and j in C_w are white, (i,j) where i in R_b and j in C_b are black. The cells where i in R_w and j in C_b, or i in R_b and j in C_w, are empty.

But for this to satisfy the condition that every empty cell is in a non-empty row or column, the union of R_w ∪ R_b must be all rows, and C_w ∪ C_b must be all columns.

Because if any row is not in R_w ∪ R_b, then that row is empty, but the columns must cover all columns, so that row's cells would be empty, which is allowed only if that row is empty. But if R_w ∪ R_b is all rows, then all rows are non-empty, which is a problem because if a row is non-empty, all its cells must be same color, but the columns are partitioned into C_w and C_b.

Wait, no. If a row is in R_w, all its cells must be white, but if the column is in C_b, then the cell (i,j) must be empty. But that's a conflict because the row is non-empty (white) and the cell (i,j) is in that row but can't have a chip because column j is non-empty (black). So, cell (i,j) must be white, but column j is non-empty (black), which is a conflict.

Therefore, this suggests that such a configuration is not possible, because it would require cells to be both white and black, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, the only way to avoid such conflicts is to have all non-empty rows and columns have the same color.

So, either:

- All non-empty rows are white, and all non-empty columns are white.

- All non-empty rows are black, and all non-empty columns are black.

In this case, the intersection of non-empty rows and columns forms a rectangle filled with either white or black chips, respectively.

So, the grid is divided into four quadrants:

1. Top-left: non-empty rows and non-empty columns, filled with same color.

2. Top-right: non-empty rows and empty columns. But wait, if columns are empty, then all cells in those columns must be empty. But if the rows are non-empty (white), then all cells in those rows must be white, which would require the columns to be non-empty. So, this can't happen.

Wait, this brings me back to the earlier conclusion that the only possible configurations are those where all non-empty rows are the same color, all non-empty columns are the same color, and the rows and columns' colors must match.

Therefore, the grid is either:

- All non-empty rows are white and all non-empty columns are white, forming a white rectangle.

- All non-empty rows are black and all non-empty columns are black, forming a black rectangle.

Additionally, the number of white and black chips must be such that they don't exceed 25 each.

Wait, but in such a case, the number of white chips would be r * c, where r is the number of non-empty white rows and c is the number of non-empty white columns. Similarly, the number of black chips would be zero in this case, because all non-empty rows and columns are white.

But the problem allows for using some black chips as well. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the grid can have two separate blocks: one white and one black, but they don't interfere with each other. But how?

Let me think: Suppose I have a white block in the top-left corner, say, of size a x b, and a black block in the bottom-right corner, of size c x d. But for this to work, the rows and columns can't be shared between the two blocks. That is, the white block's rows and columns are separate from the black block's rows and columns.

But in that case, the union of non-empty rows and columns wouldn't cover the entire grid, because the rows and columns used for white and black blocks are separate. Therefore, the cells not in either block's rows or columns would be empty, but those cells are in empty rows and empty columns, which would allow adding chips there, violating the maximality condition.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy the maximality condition is to have all non-empty rows and columns covered by a single color.

Therefore, the grid must consist of a single rectangle of white chips and the rest empty, or a single rectangle of black chips and the rest empty.

Wait, but then the number of white chips would be r*c, and the number of black chips would be zero. Similarly, if it's black, white chips are zero. But the problem allows any number of white and black chips as long as each is at most 25.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that both colors must be used. So, the grid can be all white, all black, or a mix where only one color is used.

But in that case, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose a rectangle (contiguous or not?) within the grid, filled with one color, and the rest empty.

Wait, but the rows and columns must be monochromatic if non-empty. So, the white rectangle must consist of entire rows and entire columns. So, for example, choosing a set of k rows and l columns, and filling their intersection with white chips. Similarly for black.

But in that case, the number of white chips is k*l, and the number of black chips is zero. Similarly, if you have a black rectangle, it's k*l black chips.

But the problem allows for any number of white and black chips, but in this model, you can only have either white or black, not both.

Wait, but maybe I can have both? Like, some rows assigned white, some assigned black, but ensuring that the columns are assigned the same way.

Wait, but earlier, we saw that if a row is white, all columns must be white, which would require that any black row would have to have all its columns be black, but that would lead to conflicts because the columns can't be both white and black.

Therefore, no, you can't have both white and black rows and columns without conflicts.

Therefore, the only possibilities are either:

- A white rectangle, with the rest empty. Number of white chips: k*l, where k is the number of white rows, l the number of white columns.

- A black rectangle, with the rest empty. Number of black chips: k*l.

Additionally, the problem states that you can't add any more chips. So, the white or black rectangle must be such that the remaining cells are either in empty rows or empty columns.

Wait, but if I choose k white rows and l white columns, then the remaining (5 - k) rows and (5 - l) columns must be empty. Because if any of those rows or columns were non-empty, then the intersection with the white rows or columns would require a chip, which must be of the same color, leading to a conflict.

Wait, no. If I have k white rows and l white columns, then the remaining (5 - k) rows must be empty, because if any of them were non-empty, they would have to be assigned a color, but their intersection with the white columns would require a chip of that color, which would conflict with the white in the columns.

Similarly, the remaining (5 - l) columns must be empty.

Therefore, the grid is partitioned into four blocks:

1. White rectangle: k rows × l columns.

2. Empty rows: (5 - k) rows × l columns.

3. Empty columns: k rows × (5 - l) columns.

4. Empty cells: (5 - k) rows × (5 - l) columns.

But the problem states that each cell can have at most one chip, but the placement is maximal, meaning that adding any chip would violate the conditions.

In this configuration, the only chips are in the white rectangle. The other cells are empty. But if I try to add a chip to any empty cell, it would have to be in an empty row or empty column. So, adding a chip to an empty row would require that entire row to be of that color, which would conflict with the white columns it intersects. Similarly, adding a chip to an empty column would require the entire column to be of that color, conflicting with the white rows it intersects.

Therefore, such a configuration is maximal.

Similarly, for a black rectangle.

Therefore, the total number of such configurations is the number of ways to choose a white rectangle plus the number of ways to choose a black rectangle.

But wait, choosing a white rectangle means selecting k rows and l columns, and filling their intersection with white chips. Similarly for black.

But since the white and black configurations are separate, the total number is the sum of the number of white rectangles and the number of black rectangles.

Wait, but in each case, the rectangle is determined by the choice of k rows and l columns. The number of ways to choose k rows is C(5, k), and l columns is C(5, l). Then, for each k and l, the number of white rectangles is C(5, k) * C(5, l).

Similarly, the number of black rectangles is the same.

Wait, but wait: for each possible k (number of white rows) and l (number of white columns), we have C(5, k) * C(5, l) ways. Similarly for black.

But wait, no. Because choosing which rows and columns to assign to white is independent for each color.

Wait, but in reality, the white and black configurations are mutually exclusive. You can't have both a white rectangle and a black rectangle in the same grid without causing conflicts.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is the number of white rectangles plus the number of black rectangles.

The number of white rectangles is the sum over k=1 to 5 and l=1 to 5 of C(5, k) * C(5, l).

Similarly, the number of black rectangles is the same.

Wait, but when k=0 or l=0, that would mean no white chips, which is allowed only if we have black chips. But since we are considering white and black separately, the cases where k=0 or l=0 should be included in the black configuration.

Wait, no. Because if we're considering white rectangles, k and l must be at least 1, otherwise, it's not a white rectangle.

Wait, actually, the problem says "some of these chips", so the placement must have at least one chip. So, the configurations with zero chips are excluded.

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is the number of ways to choose k ≥1 rows and l ≥1 columns, which is (2^5 -1) * (2^5 -1) = 31 * 31 = 961. Wait, no, that's if we consider any subset, but actually, the number of ways to choose k rows and l columns is C(5, k) * C(5, l), and sum over k=1 to 5 and l=1 to5.

Similarly for black.

But wait, no. Because for white rectangles, it's the number of ways to choose any non-empty subset of rows and any non-empty subset of columns. Each such choice defines a white rectangle. Similarly for black.

Therefore, the total number of white configurations is (2^5 -1) * (2^5 -1) = 31*31=961.

Similarly, the number of black configurations is also 961.

But wait, that would give a total of 1922 configurations, but this can't be right because we can't have both white and black rectangles in the same grid.

Wait, no, because each configuration is either a white rectangle or a black rectangle, not both. So, the total number is 961 (white) + 961 (black) = 1922.

But wait, that seems high, but perhaps it's correct. However, the problem allows for using both white and black chips, but in our current model, each grid is either a white rectangle or a black rectangle.

But earlier, we concluded that you can't have both white and black rectangles without causing conflicts, which is why the grid must be either all white, all black, or empty. But the problem says "some of these chips", so empty grids are not allowed.

Wait, but the problem states that each cell can have at most one chip. So, perhaps the grids can have both white and black rectangles as long as they don't overlap. But as we saw earlier, that leads to conflicts because the columns and rows would need to be both white and black in different parts, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, I think the only possible configurations are those with a single white or black rectangle, and the rest empty.

Thus, the total number of configurations is 2 * (2^5 -1)^2 = 2 * 31^2 = 2*961=1922.

But wait, the problem allows for any number of white and black chips, but in this model, each configuration uses either white or black chips, not both. So, perhaps the answer is 1922.

But wait, the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we don't have to use all of them. However, each grid must have some chips, i.e., at least one.

Wait, but in our model, each grid has either a white rectangle or a black rectangle, which can be of any size from 1x1 to 5x5.

But the problem is that the number of white chips is equal to the number of white rows multiplied by the number of white columns, which could be up to 25. Similarly for black.

But in the problem, we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we don't have to use all of them. So, the number of white chips used can be any number from 1 to 25, and similarly for black chips.

But in our earlier model, each configuration uses either white or black chips, but not both. So, the total number of configurations is 1922, as above.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the grid can have both white and black chips in separate blocks, but arranged in such a way that their rows and columns don't interfere.

Wait, let me consider a specific example. Suppose I have a white rectangle in the top-left 2x2, and a black rectangle in the bottom-right 3x3. Then, the rows 1-2 are white, columns 1-2 are white. Rows 3-5 are black, columns 3-5 are black.

But then, the cells (1,3-5) are in white rows and black columns. Since the row is white, the cells (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) must be white, but the columns 3-5 are black, which requires those cells to be black. Contradiction.

Therefore, such a configuration isn't possible.

Therefore, the only possible configurations are those with a single color block, either white or black, and the rest empty.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 2*(2^5 -1)^2 = 1922.

Wait, but 2^5 is 32, minus 1 is 31. So, 31*31=961. Multiply by 2 gives 1922.

But let me think again. For white rectangles, the number is the number of ways to choose non-empty subsets of rows and non-empty subsets of columns. Each such choice defines a white rectangle.

Similarly for black.

So, the number of white configurations is (2^5 -1) * (2^5 -1) = 31*31=961.

Same for black, so total 1922.

But wait, but the problem says "the last line of your response should be your integer answer within \boxed{}." So, perhaps that's the answer.

But wait, let me check for a smaller grid. Let's say 1x1 grid.

In that case, the number of configurations would be 2*(2^1 -1)^2=2*(1)^2=2. Which is correct: either a white chip or a black chip.

Another test case: 2x2 grid.

Number of configurations: 2*(2^2 -1)^2=2*(3)^2=18.

Let me enumerate them.

For white rectangles:

- Choose any non-empty subset of rows and any non-empty subset of columns.

In 2x2, the number of non-empty row subsets is 3 (each row can be included or not, minus the empty set: 2^2-1=3). Similarly for columns: 3.

So, 3*3=9 white configurations.

Similarly, 9 black configurations.

Total 18, which seems correct.

Each white configuration is a rectangle of white chips in the chosen rows and columns, and the rest empty.

Similarly for black.

So, for the 5x5 grid, the number is 1922.

But wait, the problem statement says "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."

In our model, the only way to place chips is with a single color block. But could there be other configurations where both colors are used without overlapping?

Wait, perhaps another approach: the grid can be divided into blocks where each block is a rectangle, and each block is assigned a color (white or black). The blocks cannot overlap in rows or columns.

Wait, but in such a case, each row can belong to only one block, and each column can belong to only one block.

But then, the blocks would have to form a partition of the grid into rectangles, each assigned a color.

But in such a case, each row is in exactly one block, and each column is in exactly one block.

Therefore, the blocks would form a partition where each block is a rectangle, and the entire grid is covered without overlapping.

But how many such partitions are possible?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe for the 5x5 grid, the number is larger.

But given the earlier reasoning, I think the only possible configurations are those with a single white or black block, so the answer is 1922.

But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the model is correct. Because if you have any other configuration with more than one color, it would require that some rows and columns are assigned multiple colors, which is impossible.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 2*(2^5 -1)^2=1922.

But wait, the problem says "the number of ways to place some of these chips" with the given conditions. So, each configuration is a maximal placement, which can't have any more chips added.

In our model, each maximal placement is a single color block, either white or black, of any size from 1x1 to 5x5.

Therefore, the number of such placements is 2*(2^5 -1)^2=1922.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused because the answer seems too large. Let me think of it differently.

Each row can be either white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be white, black, or empty. But for the grid to be valid, the color assignments must be consistent.

If a row is white, then all columns that intersect it must be white. Similarly, if a column is black, all rows that intersect it must be black.

Therefore, the color assignments must be such that all non-empty rows have the same color, and all non-empty columns have the same color, and the row color equals the column color.

Therefore, the number of possible color assignments is:

- Choose a color for the non-empty rows and columns: 2 choices (white or black).

- Choose a subset of rows to be non-empty: 2^5 -1 choices (non-empty).

- Choose a subset of columns to be non-empty: 2^5 -1 choices.

Therefore, total configurations: 2*(2^5 -1)*(2^5 -1)=2*31*31=1922.

Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the answer is 1922.


The problem involves placing indistinguishable white and black chips on a 5x5 grid under specific conditions. Each row and column must be monochromatic if non-empty, and the placement must be maximal, meaning no additional chip can be added without violating the conditions.

To solve this, we consider that the grid can only be covered by a single monochromatic rectangle (either white or black) and the rest of the cells must be empty. This is because if there were multiple colors, it would lead to conflicts where a cell would need to be both white and black, which is impossible.

For each color (white or black), the number of ways to choose non-empty rows and columns is determined by selecting any non-empty subset of rows and any non-empty subset of columns. The number of non-empty subsets for rows and columns is \(2^5 - 1 = 31\). Thus, for each color, there are \(31 \times 31 = 961\) configurations.

Since there are two colors, the total number of configurations is \(2 \times 961 = 1922\).

Therefore, the number of valid ways to place the chips is:

\boxed{1922}
