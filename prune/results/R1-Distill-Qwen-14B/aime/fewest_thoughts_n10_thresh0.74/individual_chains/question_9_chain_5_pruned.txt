Okay, so I have this problem here: There are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down what I know. The problem gives two logarithmic equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

And we're told that x and y are both greater than 1. So, I need to find x and y and then multiply them together to get xy.

Let me recall some logarithmic identities. The logarithm log_b(a^k) is equal to k * log_b(a). So, applying that to the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So, let's rewrite both equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. Now, I know that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as k. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So substituting into the equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. 4y * (1/k) = 10

So now I have two equations:

1. xk = 10
2. (4y)/k = 10

I can solve these equations for x and y in terms of k.

From equation 1: x = 10 / k.

From equation 2: 4y = 10k => y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

So, now I have x and y in terms of k:

x = 10/k

y = (5k)/2

Now, I can substitute these into one of the original logarithmic expressions to solve for k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship between x and y. Since log_x(y) = k, which is equal to log(y)/log(x) [using change of base formula].

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to express y in terms of x, or vice versa, and then substitute into another equation.

Wait, if I have x in terms of k and y in terms of k, perhaps I can find another equation that relates x and y.

Wait, but I think I can also use the relationship that log_x(y) = k. Since x = 10/k, and y = (5k)/2, let's express log_x(y) in terms of these.

So, log_x(y) should be equal to k.

y = (5k)/2, and x = 10/k.

So, let's write log_{10/k} (5k/2) = k.

Hmm, that's a logarithmic equation in terms of k. Let me rewrite this using the change of base formula.

log_{10/k} (5k/2) = k

Which is equal to log(5k/2) / log(10/k) = k, where the logs can be in any base, let's say base 10 for simplicity.

So, log(5k/2) / log(10/k) = k.

Let me write it as:

log(5k/2) = k * log(10/k)

Hmm, perhaps it's better to letâ€™s define t = k. So, let's write:

log(5t/2) = t * log(10/t)

I can expand the right side:

t * [log(10) - log(t)] = t * log(10) - t log(t)

So, the equation becomes:

log(5t/2) = t log(10) - t log(t)

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can rewrite it further.

Let me write 5t/2 as (5/2) t. So, log( (5/2) t ) = t log(10) - t log(t)

Using the logarithm of a product: log(5/2) + log(t) = t log(10) - t log(t)

So, log(5/2) + log(t) = t log(10) - t log(t)

Let me bring all terms to one side:

log(5/2) + log(t) - t log(10) + t log(t) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe
