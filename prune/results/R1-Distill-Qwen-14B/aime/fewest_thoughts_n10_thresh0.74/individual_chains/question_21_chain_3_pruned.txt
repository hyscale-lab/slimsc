Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. My task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Alright, let me break this down. So, n is a two-digit number in base b. That means in base 10, n can be expressed as a * b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, 'a' must be at least 1 (since leading zeros aren't allowed), and 'c' can be from 0 up to b-1.

The second condition is that a + c equals the square root of n. So, mathematically, we can write this as:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But since n = a*b + c, substituting that in gives:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can rearrange terms:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of 'a'. Since a must be a positive integer (digit in base b), the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square for 'a' to be an integer.

The discriminant D of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c is D = b^2 - 4ac. Wait, but in this case, the quadratic is in 'a', so let me be careful with notation.

Wait, actually, the quadratic is: 

A*a^2 + B*a + C = 0,

where A = 1,

B = (2c - b),

C = (c^2 - c)

So, the discriminant D is:

D = B^2 - 4*A*C = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c^2 - c)

Let me compute that:

(2c - b)^2 = 4c^2 -4bc + b^2

Then subtract 4*(c^2 - c) = 4c^2 -4c

So,

D = (4c^2 -4bc + b^2) - (4c^2 -4c)

Simplify term by term:

4c^2 -4bc + b^2 -4c^2 +4c

The 4c^2 terms cancel:

-4bc + b^2 +4c

So,

D = b^2 -4bc +4c

Hmm, that's the discriminant. For 'a' to be an integer, D must be a perfect square.

Let me factor that expression a bit:

b^2 -4bc +4c = b^2 - c*(4b -4)

Wait, maybe I can factor it differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

D = b^2 -4c(b -1)

Not sure if that helps. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

D = b^2 -4bc +4c = b^2 -4c(b -1)

Alternatively, factor as:

D = b^2 -4c(b -1) = (b)^2 -4c(b -1)

Hmm, perhaps not the most helpful. Maybe I should think about the quadratic equation for 'a' again.

We have:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

We can solve for 'a' using the quadratic formula:

a = [ -(2c - b) ± sqrt(D) ] / (2)

Since 'a' must be a positive integer, the numerator must be even, and the sqrt(D) must be an integer. Let me denote sqrt(D) as k, where k is an integer.

So,

a = [ - (2c - b) ± k ] / 2

Which can be written as:

a = [ b - 2c ± k ] / 2

Since 'a' must be positive, the numerator must be positive. So,

b - 2c ± k > 0

But let's think about possible ranges for c. Since c is a digit in base b, c can be from 0 to b-1. However, since n is a two-digit number in base b, a must be at least 1, so:

a = [ b - 2c ± k ] / 2 ≥ 1

So,

b - 2c ± k ≥ 2

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the
