Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it's symmetric. That probably means that rotations of the octagon can map the coloring onto itself in various ways. The key here is that we need to find colorings where after some rotation, every blue vertex is now on a position that was red before the rotation.

Wait, so if I rotate the octagon, each vertex moves to a new position. The original positions have some red and blue vertices. After rotation, the blue ones should align with the red ones. So essentially, the set of blue vertices after rotation should equal the set of red vertices before rotation.

But the octagon is being rotated, so the positions are cyclically shifted. So the coloring must be such that the blue vertices, when rotated by some number of steps, exactly match the red vertices.

Another way to put this: the coloring must be a "shifted version" where blue and red are swapped. So maybe the coloring has some rotational symmetry where the blue and red sets are rotations of each other.

Wait, but the octagon has 8 vertices, so it's a cyclic group of order 8. So the rotations correspond to shifting by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. So for a given coloring, we need to check if there exists a rotation (i.e., a shift) such that the set of blue vertices is exactly the image of the red vertices under that rotation.

Alternatively, if we think of the octagon's vertices as elements of the cyclic group Z8, then the coloring is a subset S of Z8 where each element is colored red or blue. We need that there's some rotation (i.e., an element k in Z8) such that the set S (blues) is equal to k + (Z8 \ S) (reds). Because when you rotate by k, the reds become k + (Z8 \ S), and we want that to equal S.

So, S = k + (Z8 \ S). Let's rewrite that: S = k + (Z8 \ S). That implies that S is a translate of the complement of itself. So S ∪ (k + S) = Z8, and S ∩ (k + S) = empty set. Hmm, but that might not be the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of this as S = k + S', where S' is the set of red vertices. But since S' is the complement of S (assuming each vertex is either red or blue), S' = Z8 \ S. So S = k + (Z8 \ S). That gives us S = k + Z8 \ k + S. Wait, that seems confusing.

Wait, no. Let's think of it as S = k + (Z8 \ S). So if we consider the operation in Z8, then S is equal to the set obtained by shifting the complement of S by k positions.

So, S = k + (Z8 \ S). Rearranging, we get S + k = Z8 \ S. So, S + k is the complement of S.

Another approach: Let's think of the characteristic function of S. Let me denote the characteristic function as χ_S, where χ_S(i) = 1 if vertex i is blue, 0 otherwise.

Then, after rotating by k, the characteristic function becomes χ_S shifted by k, which is χ_{S + k}. We need χ_{S + k} to equal the characteristic function of the red vertices, which is 1 - χ_S.

So, χ_{S + k}(i) = 1 - χ_S(i
