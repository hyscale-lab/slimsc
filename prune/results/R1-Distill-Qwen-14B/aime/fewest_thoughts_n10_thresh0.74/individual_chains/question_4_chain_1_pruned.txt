Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this seems like a combinatorial game problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, while a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, we need to find all n where the starting position is a losing position for Alice, which would mean it's a winning position for Bob. Because Alice is going first, if the initial position is a losing one for her, Bob can always respond in a way that leads Alice to more losing positions, eventually making Bob the winner.

I think the standard approach is to use dynamic programming or recursive reasoning to find the pattern of losing and winning positions. Let's try to model this.

Let's define the positions as follows:
- If n is 0, the game is over, so that's a losing position because there are no tokens left to take. But wait, in the game, the person who takes the last token wins. So, if a player is faced with n=0, they can't make a move and thus lose. So n=0 is a losing position.

But in our problem, n starts at 1. So let's build a table for n from 1 upwards, determining whether each is a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

For n=1:
- Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position (W).

n=2:
- Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take 1 and win. Wait, no—wait. Wait, in this case, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes 1 and wins. So that's bad for Alice. But wait, is that the only option? Or can she take 4 tokens? She can't take 4 from 2, so she can only take 1. So yes, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning
