Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem describes a torus T. It's created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the same plane as the circle. The axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, imagine taking a circle of radius 3 and spinning it around a line that's 6 units from its center. That makes a donut shape, right?

The torus has two important measurements: the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution) and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle itself). In this case, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So, R = 6, r = 3.

Next, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest inside and outside the sphere, and in each case, it's tangent along a circle. The radii of these circles are r_i (internal tangent) and r_o (external tangent). We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the points of tangency form a circle on both the torus and the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the tangency is along another circle.

I think both situations involve the centers of the sphere and the torus. Let me visualize this. The sphere is fixed with radius 11. The torus is a donut shape, so when it's inside, its center (the center of the generating circle) is somewhere inside the sphere. Wait, but the torus is a surface, so maybe the "center" is the center of the major circle.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the centers of the sphere S and the center of the tube of the torus T. Let me think. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere would be along the axis of the torus. Wait, no. Wait, no, the torus is generated by rotating a circle around the axis. So, the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the axis. So the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis, and the generating circle has radius 3.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11. The center of the sphere and the center of the generating circle of the torus must be separated by a certain distance. Let's denote that distance as D.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the torus must be equal to 11, because that's where they are tangent.

Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. When two surfaces are tangent, they touch at exactly one point (if they're tangent externally) or along a circle (if they are tangent in a co-axial setup). In this case, the problem says they are tangent along a circle, which suggests that they are co-axial, right
