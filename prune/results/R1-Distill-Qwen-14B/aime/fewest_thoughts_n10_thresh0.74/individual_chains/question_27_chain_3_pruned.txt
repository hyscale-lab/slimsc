Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3. 

The sphere S has a radius of 11. The problem says that when the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so first, let me think about what it means for the torus to be tangent to the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere, they touch along a circle, and when it's outside, they also touch along a circle. The radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, are what I need to find.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether they're externally or internally tangent. But wait, in this case, both are surfaces in three dimensions. So, maybe it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, no. The torus isn't a sphere; it's a surface of revolution. So, maybe I need to think about the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at some point, and the torus is positioned such that it's just touching the sphere from the inside. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus is just touching the sphere from the outside.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the sphere and the torus as both centered along the same axis. Because when you revolve a circle around an axis, the torus is symmetric around that axis. So, perhaps both the sphere and the torus share the same central axis for their centers.

Let me try to model this mathematically. Let's consider the sphere S with radius 11, centered at the origin (0,0,0). The torus T is created by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius R of the torus is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. That means the sphere and the torus touch at exactly one point on that circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they touch along another circle.

Wait, maybe I should think about the distance between the centers of the sphere and the center of the torus. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units from its center. So, the center of that generating circle is 6 units away from the axis of rotation. But where is the center of the torus? Hmm, actually, the torus's center is along the axis of rotation, right? Because the generating circle is moving around that axis.

So, if I place the torus such that its center is along the same axis as the sphere's center, maybe the sphere's center coincides with the torus's center when they're tangent? But wait, no.
