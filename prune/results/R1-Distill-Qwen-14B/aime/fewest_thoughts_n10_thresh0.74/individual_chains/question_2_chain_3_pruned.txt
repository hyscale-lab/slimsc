Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand the problem first.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Then there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So each segment PQ connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, with length 1. And all these segments are in the first quadrant, so both P and Q have positive coordinates.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB to confirm.

Calculating AB's length: the distance between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Using the distance formula: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, it's a unit segment, so AB is indeed in F.

So, point C is on AB, but not at A or B. And this point C is special because it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, all other segments in F avoid C, except AB.

We need to find OC², where OC is the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q with p and q coprime, then find p + q.

Okay, let's plan how to approach this.

First, let's parametrize segment AB. Since it's a straight line from A to B, any point C on AB can be written as a linear combination of A and B.

Let me denote point C as (x, y). Since C is on AB, we can express x and y in terms of a parameter t, where t is between 0 and 1.

So, from A to B, the x-coordinate goes from 1/2 to 0, so x = (1/2)(1 - t). Similarly, the y-coordinate goes from 0 to sqrt(3)/2, so y = (sqrt(3)/2) t.

So, point C is ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1. We need to find the specific t such that C lies on AB but not on any other PQ in F except AB.

Alternatively, we can think of all the segments PQ in F as lines connecting (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1, since the length is 1. Wait, actually, the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So p² + q² = 1. So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q are positive real numbers satisfying p² + q² = 1.

So, for each such segment PQ, the equation of the line can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1. Because it's the intercept form of the line equation, with x-intercept p and y-intercept q.

Now, our point C is ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t). We need to find t such that C is not on any other segment PQ except AB.

So, suppose C lies on another segment PQ from F. Then, substituting x = (1 - t)/2 and y = (sqrt(3)/2) t into the equation x/p + y/q = 1 of that segment, we get:

[(1 - t)/2]/p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ]/q = 1.

But also, since PQ is in F, p² + q² = 1.

So, if C were on another PQ, there would exist p and q with p² + q² = 1 such that the above equation holds, and (p,0) and (0,q) are different from A and B.

But since C is only on AB and no other PQ, there should be no solution (p, q) other than the specific p and q corresponding to AB.

So, AB has p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the equation for AB is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1, which simplifies to 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y = 1.

Let me check that: plugging in point A
