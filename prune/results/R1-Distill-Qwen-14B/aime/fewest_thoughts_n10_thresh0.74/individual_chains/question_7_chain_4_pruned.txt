Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue with a 50-50 chance. So, each coloring is equally likely, and there are a total of 2^8 = 256 possible colorings.

The key here is that we need the octagon to be rotatable such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, say k positions, then for every vertex that's blue in the original, the vertex k positions ahead (modulo 8) should be red in the original.

Wait, no, actually, when you rotate the octagon, each vertex moves to the position of the next one. So if I rotate it by k steps, vertex 1 goes to position 1 + k, vertex 2 goes to position 2 + k, etc., modulo 8.

But the problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices are now where red vertices were originally. So, for the rotated octagon, each blue vertex in the new position was red in the original. Which would mean that the set of blue vertices in the original must be a shifted version of the set of red vertices in the original.

Wait, maybe another way to look at it: Letâ€™s denote the original coloring as a sequence C = (C0, C1, ..., C7), where each Ci is either red or blue. We need to find if there exists a rotation by k steps (k = 0, 1, ..., 7) such that for every i, C_{(i - k) mod 8} is red whenever Ci is blue.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices in the original must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because when you rotate, the blue vertices must align with where the reds were.

Wait, but that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again. When you rotate the octagon by k positions, each blue vertex in the original moves to position (i + k) mod 8. For the rotated octagon to have all blue vertices over reds, each (i + k) mod 8 must have been red in the original. So, all the positions that are blue in the original, when shifted by k, must have been red.

So, the set of blue vertices, when shifted by k, must be a subset of the red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, the red vertices are fixed; shifting the blue set by k must land entirely within the red set.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be a cyclic shift of the red vertices. But the set of red vertices is the complement of the blue set. So, the blue set must be a cyclic shift of its own complement.

Wait, that
