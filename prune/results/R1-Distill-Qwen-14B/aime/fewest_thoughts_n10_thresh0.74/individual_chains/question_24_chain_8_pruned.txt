Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem states: There's a list of positive integers with three main properties.

1. The sum of all the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And the question is asking for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. I need to find such a list that meets all these conditions and then compute the sum of the squares of its elements.

First, let's understand the terms:

- **Sum of the items is 30**: So when I add up all the numbers in the list, it should equal 30.

- **Unique mode is 9**: Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, meaning no other number appears as many times as 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

- **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. But in this case, the median isn't actually present in the list. That's interesting because typically, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one, which is part of the list. So maybe the list has an even number of elements, making the median the average of two middle numbers, neither of which is in the list? Or perhaps the list has an odd number of elements, but the middle number is not present, which seems a bit impossible unless... Hmm, maybe the median is calculated as the average of two numbers that aren't the same, so it's a non-integer? But the problem says the median is a positive integer, so it can't be a fraction. So that suggests that the list must have an even number of elements, and the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is an integer, but neither of those two middle numbers is equal to that median. Wait, but the median is an integer, so the average of two integers must be an integer. That would require that the two middle numbers are either both even or both odd. But their average (the median) is not present in the list.

Wait, but the median is computed as the average of the two middle numbers in a list with even length. So for example, if the two middle numbers are a and b, then the median is (a + b)/2. So if the median is an integer, then (a + b) must be even, meaning a and b are both even or both odd. Also, the median (a + b)/2 is not present in the list. So, that requires that neither a nor b equals (a + b)/2.

Wait, but let's think: if a and b are the same, say both are 5, then the median would be 5, which would be present in the list. But the problem says the median is not present in the list. So that can't happen. Therefore, a and b must be different, and their average must not be present in the list
