Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, once I find that p, I need to find the smallest positive integer m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that if a prime p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. That implies that n^8 ≡ 1 mod p because squaring both sides gives n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p divides 8. But since n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4 or lower because that would mean n^4 ≡ 1 mod p instead. So the order of n modulo p must be 8.

From group theory, I know that the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic with order p-1. So for the order of n modulo p to be 8, 8 must divide p-1. Therefore, p must be congruent to 1 mod 8. So the primes we're looking at are primes like 17, 97, etc. But wait, what about smaller primes? Let me check the small primes first to see if any of them satisfy the condition.

Let's list out the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc. I need to check whether for any of these primes, there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So let's start with p=2. Hmm, n⁴ +1. For p=2, n⁴ is 0 mod 2 if n is even, and 1 mod 2 if n is odd. So n⁴ +1 is 1 mod 2 if n is odd, which isn't 0 mod 2²=4. Let's check n=1: 1 +1=2, which is 2 mod 4, not 0. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. So n⁴ ≡ 8 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 is periodic with period 9). 

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9.
n=2: 16 mod9=7.
n=3: 81 mod9=0.
n=4: 256 mod9. 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4 → 4 mod9.
n=5: 625 mod9. 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4 → 4 mod9?
Wait, 5²=25, 25 mod9=7, so 5⁴=(5²)²=7²=49 mod9=4. So n=5 also gives 4 mod9.
n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod9=0.
n=7: Let's compute 7 mod9=7. 7²=49 mod9=4, 7⁴=(7²)²=4²=16 mod9=7.
n=8: 8 mod9=8. 8²=64 mod9=1, 8⁴=(8²)²=1²=1 mod9.

So n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8: 1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1. None of them are 8 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work.

Next prime p=5. Let's check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. So n⁴ ≡24 mod25. Let's see if any n satisfies this. We can check n=1 to 24, but maybe we can find a pattern or use Euler's theorem. The multiplicative order modulo 25 is φ(25)=20. So n^20≡1 mod25 for n coprime to 25.

But we can try small n. Let's compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 5, because mod25 repeats every 25 numbers, but maybe a pattern emerges.

n=1: 1 mod25
n=2: 16 mod25
n=3: 81 mod25=6
n=4: 256 mod25=6 (since 25*10=250, 256-250=6)
n=5: 0
n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296/25=51*25=1275, 1296-1275=21 →21 mod25
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401-25*96=2401-2400=1 →1 mod25
n=8:8⁴=4096. 4096 mod25. 25*163=4075. 4096-4075=21→21 mod25
n=9:9⁴=6561. 6561 mod25: 25*262=6550, 6561-6550=11→11 mod25
n=10:0 mod25
n=11:11⁴=14641. Let's compute 11²=121 mod25=21. 21²=441 mod25=16. So 11⁴=16 mod25.
n=12:12²=144 mod25=19. 12⁴=19²=361 mod25=11 mod25.
n=13:13²=169 mod25=19. 13⁴=19²=361 mod25=11.
n=14:14²=196 mod25=21. 14⁴=21²=441 mod25=16.
n=15:0 mod25.
n=16:16²=256 mod25=6. 16⁴=6²=36 mod25=11.
n=17:17²=289 mod25=14. 17⁴=14²=196 mod25=21.
n=18:18²=324 mod25=24. 18⁴=24²=576 mod25=1. Because 576-23*25=576-575=1.
n=19:19²=361 mod25=11. 19⁴=11²=121 mod25=21.
n=20:0 mod25.
n=21:21²=441 mod25=16. 21⁴=16²=256 mod25=6.
n=22:22²=484 mod25=9. 22⁴=9²=81 mod25=6.
n=23:23²=529 mod25=4. 23⁴=4²=16 mod25.
n=24:24²=576 mod25=1. 24⁴=1²=1 mod25.

So looking through all n from 1 to 24, the n⁴ mod25 results are: 1,16,6,6,0,21,1,21,11,0,16,11,16,11,0,11,21,1,21,16,6,6,1.

I don't see a 24 mod25 in any of these. So p=5 doesn't work either.

Next prime is p=7. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49. So n⁴ ≡48 mod49.

I can try to compute n⁴ mod49 for some n. Maybe by trying small numbers or looking for patterns.

Alternatively, I remember that if p is a prime where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p², then certain conditions on p must hold. For primes congruent to 1 mod 8, we might have solutions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps only primes where 8 divides p-
