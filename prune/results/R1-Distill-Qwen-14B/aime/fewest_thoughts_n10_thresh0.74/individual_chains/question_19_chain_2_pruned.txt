Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.

First, let me recall some concepts. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That's an important condition. I wonder how that affects the triangle. Maybe I can use some properties or formulas involving the inradius, circumradius, and the distances between these centers.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, let me think. Is that correct? I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, actually, the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, OI = sqrt(R² - 2Rr). Let me plug in the values given. R is 13, r is 6. So OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Okay, so the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle OIA, which is a right-angled triangle at I, we can apply Pythagoras' theorem.

So, OA is the distance from the circumcenter to vertex A, which is just the circumradius R, which is 13. So, in triangle OIA, OA is 13, OI is sqrt(13), and IA is the inradius, which is 6?

Wait, no, wait. IA is the inradius? No, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, not necessarily to the vertex. Hmm, so IA
