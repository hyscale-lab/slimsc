Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that the equation a + b + c = 300 is a linear equation, which usually has a lot of solutions in nonnegative integers. But the second equation is quadratic and involves products of variables, which might narrow things down.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that it's symmetric in a, b, and c. Each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. So maybe I can factor this expression somehow or find a way to relate it to (a + b + c).

Let me try to rewrite the second expression. Hmm, if I factor it, I can group terms:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Since a + b + c = 300, substituting that in might help. Let's see:

a²(b + c) = a²(300 - a)
Similarly, b²(a + c) = b²(300 - b)
c²(a + b) = c²(300 - c)

So, the second equation becomes:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that might be a bit easier to handle. Let me write that down:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate this to the sum a + b + c = 300. Maybe if I let two variables be equal or something like that.

Alternatively, I can think about the expression in terms of a, b, c. Maybe if I consider the variables as a, b, and c, perhaps two of them are equal or some other symmetric condition.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can factor the second equation differently. Let me see:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c).

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let me think about another approach.

Since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express each of b + c, a + c, a + b in terms of the other variable. So, as I did before, b + c = 300 - a, etc.

So, the expression is a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me denote S = a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c). So S = 6,000,000.

I wonder if I can find a relationship between S and (a + b + c). Alternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of the sum of a, b, c, and their products.

Wait, let's compute S:

S = a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(
