Okay, so I have this problem where points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and they form a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, rhombus, hyperbola, diagonals intersecting at the origin... Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Or wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. No, wait, actually, I think I got that wrong. Let me recall: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A and C are on one diagonal, and points B and D are on the other diagonal. So, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y), because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D would be (-p, -q).

But wait, ABCD is a rhombus, so all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be found using the lengths of the diagonals.

Wait, another approach: for a rhombus with diagonals of length d1 and d2, the area is (d1*d2)/2, and each side can be calculated using the formula sqrt((d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2). So, perhaps that's a direction.

But in this problem, all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, points A, B, C, D are all on this hyperbola.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint, the coordinates of the points are as I thought before: A(x, y), C(-x, -y), B(p, q), D(-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.

So, let's write down the coordinates:

A: (x, y)
B: (p, q)
C: (-x, -y)
D: (-p, -q)

Now, the sides:

AB: distance from A to B is sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2]

BC: distance from B to C is sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2]

CD: distance from C to D is sqrt[(-p + x)^2 + (-q + y)^2]

DA: distance from D to A is sqrt[(x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2]

Since it's a rhombus, all these distances are equal.

So, set AB = BC:

sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2] = sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2]

Squaring both sides:

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2

Expanding both sides:

Left: (p^2 - 2px + x^2) + (q^2 - 2qy + y^2)

Right: (x^2 + 2px + p^2) + (y^2 + 2qy + q^2)

So, left is p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y²

Right is p² + 2px + x² + q² + 2qy + y²

Subtract left from right:

[Right] - [Left] = (2px + 2qy) - (-2px -2qy) = 4px +4qy = 0

So, 4px +4qy = 0 ⇒ px + qy = 0.

Similarly, if I set AB = DA, which is another pair:

AB: sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2] = DA: sqrt[(x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2]

Squaring both sides:

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2

Left: p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y²

Right: p² + 2px + x² + q² + 2qy + y²

Subtract left from right:

(2px + 2qy) - (-2px -2qy) = 4px +4qy = 0 ⇒ px + qy = 0.

So, same condition. So, only the condition px + qy = 0 arises from equating AB = BC and AB = DA.

But that's just one condition. Since we have four points on the hyperbola, maybe we can find more conditions.

So, given that A and B are points on the hyperbola, so:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

For point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

Also, from the condition px + qy = 0.

So, now, I have three equations:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

2. p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

3. px + qy = 0

I need to find BD². Let's see, point B is (p, q), D is (-p, -q). So, the distance BD is the distance between (p, q) and (-p, -q), which is sqrt[( -p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p² + 4q²] = 2*sqrt(p² + q²). So, BD squared is [2*sqrt(p² + q²)]² = 4(p² + q²).

So, BD² = 4(p² + q²). We need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD², but wait, no, the problem says the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD², because the number must be less than all BD², so the supremum of the lower bounds, which is the infimum.

Wait, actually, to clarify: the question is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that number is the infimum of BD² over all possible such rhombi. Because if you take the infimum, that's the smallest BD² can be, so any number less than that would be less than BD² for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is the infimum itself.

Wait, actually, let me think again. The infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, if I can find the minimal possible BD², then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be that minimal
