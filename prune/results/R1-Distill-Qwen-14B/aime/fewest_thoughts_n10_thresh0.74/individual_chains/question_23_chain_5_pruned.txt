Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. I remember that hyperbolas have some standard properties, so maybe I should recall those. The general form is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, where 'a' is the distance from the center to each vertex along the x-axis, and 'b' is related to the conjugate axis. So here, a² is 20, so a is sqrt(20) which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5). And b² is 24, so b is 2*sqrt(6).

Now, the problem mentions a rhombus ABCD with points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, I think. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. No, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, hold on, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, I think that's right because the rhombus is a type of parallelogram with equal sides, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So okay, that's a key point.

The diagonals intersect at the origin. That means the point where the diagonals cross is at (0,0). So the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So if ABCD is the rhombus, then the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

Given that, points A and C must be symmetric with respect to the origin, and similarly, points B and D must be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. So if point A is (x,y), then point C would be (-x,-y). Similarly, if point B is (p,q), then point D would be (-p,-q).

So, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. So, substituting point A into the hyperbola equation: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Similarly for point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So the distances AB, BC, CD, DA are equal. But maybe working with vectors could be easier here because we can use the coordinates of the points.

Alternatively, since it's a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, perhaps we can parameterize the points.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and they bisect each other. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.

So, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the origin is their midpoint.

So, let me think about the coordinates. Let me denote point A as (x, y). Then, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B is (u, v), so point D is (-u, -v).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all
