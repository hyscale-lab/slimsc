Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to break down what the problem is saying and figure out how to approach it.

First, the definition: a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me rephrase that in my own words. So, in base b, a two-digit number would be something like "ab" where a and b are digits in base b. But wait, no, actually, the digits are in base b, so each digit must be less than b. So, the number in base b would be a two-digit number with the first digit (let's call it d1) and the second digit (d2), both of which are between 0 and b-1, and the first digit can't be zero because it's a two-digit number.

So, the value of this two-digit number in base b would be d1*b + d2. And according to the problem, the sum of d1 and d2 equals the square root of that number. So, putting it together, the equation we have is:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(n)
and
n = d1*b + d2

Since n is equal to d1*b + d2, substituting into the first equation, we get:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 = d1*b + d2

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 - d1*b - d2 = 0

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can reorganize the terms:

d1^2 + (2*d2 - b)*d1 + (d2^2 - d2) = 0

That's a quadratic equation in terms of d1. Let me write it as:

d1^2 + (2*d2 - b)*d1 + (d2^2 - d2) = 0

I can think of this as a quadratic in the variable d1, where the coefficients depend on d2 and b. Since d1 and d2 are digits in base b, they must satisfy 1 <= d1 <= b-1 (since it's the first digit of a two-digit number) and 0 <= d2 <= b-1.

Since d1 must be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square. Let me compute the discriminant D:

D = (2*d2 - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(d2^2 - d2)

Let me expand this:

D = 4*d2^2 - 4*b*d2 + b^2 - 4*d2^2 + 4*d2

Simplify:

The 4*d2^2 and -4*d2^2 cancel out. So:

D = (-4*b*d2 + b^2) + 4*d2

Factor out the terms:

D = b^2 -4*b*d2 + 4*d2

Hmm, maybe factor out d2 terms:

D = b^2 + d2*(-4*b + 4)

Alternatively, D = b^2 + 4*d2*(1 - b)

Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps factor differently:

D = b^2 -4*d2*(b -1)

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the discriminant is (2d2 - b)^2 -4*(d2^2 -d2). So:

(2d2 -b)^2 = 4d2^2 -4b d2 + b^2

Then subtract 4*(d2^2 -d2) = 4d2^2 -4d2

So overall:

4d2^2 -4b d2 + b^2 -4d2^2 +4d2 = (-4b d2 +4d2) + b^2

Which is:

= (4d2 -4b d2) + b^2
= 4d2*(1 - b) + b^2

So D = b^2 +4d2*(1 - b) = b^2 -4d2*(b -1)

Yes, that's correct.

So the discriminant D must be a perfect square for d1 to be an integer. So, let me write D as:

D = [b^2 -4d2*(b -1)]

Which must be a perfect square.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of variables. Let me denote D = k^2, where k is a non-negative integer.

So:

b^2 -4d2*(b -1) = k^2

Hmm, this equation must hold for some integer k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the original equation:

We had:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)

Which squared
