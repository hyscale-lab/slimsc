Alright, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer needs to be in a particular form, and then I have to find the sum of m, n, and p where the distance is expressed as m√n / p with m and p being coprime and n square-free. 

First, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. The edges are AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. It seems like the opposite edges are equal, which probably means the tetrahedron is isosceles or maybe even symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of "mirror" tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. 

I remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called a disphenoid. So, this should be a disphenoid. Disphenoids have some nice properties, like all faces being congruent triangles. Wait, but in this case, the edges are given as AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, but each pair has a different length. So, the faces might not all be congruent, but they could still be congruent in pairs. Hmm, maybe each pair of opposite faces are congruent.

So, if it's a disphenoid, maybe it has some symmetry that can help me find the inradius. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume and the surface area, and then relate them to find the inradius.

I recall that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / A_total

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and A_total is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, if I can find the volume and the total surface area, I can compute r.

So, my plan is:

1. Compute the volume of the tetrahedron.
2. Compute the areas of each face.
3. Sum the areas to get the total surface area.
4. Use the formula r = 3V / A_total to find the inradius.

But wait, to compute the volume of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths, I might need to use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That's a formula that allows computing the volume given all six edge lengths. Let me recall that.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, and CD = f is given by:

Volume = √[ CM / 288 ]

Where CM is the determinant of the matrix:

| 0    1     1     1     1  |
| 1    0    a²    b²    c² |
| 1   a²    0     d²    e
