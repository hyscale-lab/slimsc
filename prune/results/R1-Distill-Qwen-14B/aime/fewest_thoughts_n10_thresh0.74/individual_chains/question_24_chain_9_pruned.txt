Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have a list of positive integers with certain properties. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states:

- The sum of all items is 30.
- The unique mode is 9.
- The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items.

Alright, let's start by understanding each condition and how they can help us construct the list.

1. **Sum is 30**: So whatever numbers we choose, their total should add up to 30.

2. **Unique mode is 9**: Mode means the number that appears most frequently. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number in the list. Also, it's the only mode, so no other number can appear the same number of times as 9.

3. **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: Median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the median here is a positive integer and not present in the list. That's interesting because usually, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is one of the elements. So for the median to not be in the list, the list must have an even number of elements because then the median is the average of two middle numbers, which might not be present.

Wait, but could it be that the list has an odd number of elements and the median is a number that isn't present? Hmm, no. Because if the list has an odd number, say 5 elements, arranged as a, b, c, d, e, the median is the third element, c. So c has to be in the list. So for the median not to be in the list, the list must have an even number of elements, because then the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not even be integers. But the median is given as a positive integer, so the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer.

Wait a minute, so the median is an integer, but it's not present in the list. So the two middle numbers must average to an integer, meaning their sum is even. So either both are even or both are odd.

But the median is not in the list, so the two middle numbers are different from the median. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let's think about how to structure the list.

Let me also remember that the mode is 9, so 9 has to appear more times than any other number. So perhaps 9 appears at least twice, but maybe more.

Let me consider the possible lengths of the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements. Since the median is an integer, if n is even, then the median is (a_{n/2} + a_{n/2 +1}) / 2. If n is odd, the median is a_{(n+1)/2}, which is in the list, which can't be the case because the median isn't in the list. So n must
