Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's start by visualizing the problem. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, each pair of opposite sides is both equal in length and parallel. That makes me think of a regular hexagon, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal. But it is equilateral, so all sides are the same length, let's say 's'.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. I imagine that each of these extended sides forms a larger triangle outside the hexagon. So, the hexagon is inscribed in this triangle, with each pair of opposite sides extending to meet at the triangle's vertices.

Wait, so maybe the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down? Or maybe not exactly similar. Let me think about how the sides of the triangle relate to the hexagon.

Since opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, the hexagon is a centrally symmetric figure, right? That means it's symmetric about its center point. So, each vertex has an opposite vertex, and the sides are in corresponding directions.

Hmm, so if I can model the hexagon within the triangle, perhaps I can find the scaling factor from the triangle to the hexagon. 

Let me consider the triangle as being divided by three lines extending from the sides of the hexagon. Each side of the triangle is divided into segments by these extensions.

Wait, let's denote the triangle as T, with sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. Let me call the triangle ABC, where AB = 200, BC = 240, and AC = 300. Wait, but hold on, triangle sides must satisfy the triangle inequality. Let me confirm: 200 + 240 > 300? 440 > 300, yes. 200 + 300 > 240? 500 > 240, yes. 240 + 300 > 200? 540 > 200, yes. So, it's a valid triangle.

Now, the hexagon is inside this triangle, with each pair of opposite sides extended to form the triangle's sides. So, each side of the triangle is intersected by extensions of the hexagon's sides.

But how exactly? Let me think about the hexagon's structure. It's a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, if I label the hexagon's vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F in order, then AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, no, in a hexagon, opposite sides are AB-DE, BC-EF, and CD-FA? Or maybe AB-DC, BC-EF, CD-FA? Wait, perhaps I should label the hexagon properly.

Let me correct that. In a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. For a convex equilateral hexagon, the opposite sides are not adjacent. So, for ABCDEF, the opposite sides are AB opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think: in a hexagon, opposite sides are separated by two sides. So, AB is opposite to ED, BC opposite to FE, CD opposite to AF, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assign directions to each side.

Since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a translation of each pair of opposite sides. So, each pair is a translation along their direction vectors.

Wait, maybe I should model this using vectors. Since the sides are parallel and equal in length, the hex
