Okay, I'm trying to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. I need to find the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that turns all blue vertices into positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me try to understand the problem. So, we have a regular octagon, which has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with a 50-50 chance. So, each coloring is equally likely, right?

Now, the question is about the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were, and vice versa. Hmm, wait. Actually, the wording says, "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotation, every blue vertex is now where a red was before. But does this mean that all red vertices must have been blue before? Or is it more about mapping blues to reds, regardless of what the reds become?

I think it's the former. If I can rotate the octagon so that every blue is now on a red position, that would imply that all reds must have moved to blue positions, right? Because the octagon is rotated as a whole. So, if I rotate it so that every blue is on a red spot, then every red must be on a blue spot. So, in effect, the entire coloring is inverted under some rotation.

Wait, so that would mean that the coloring is such that when you rotate it by a certain number of steps, it swaps red and blue. So, the coloring is rotationally symmetric in a way that swapping red and blue is achieved by a rotation. Interesting.

So, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the number of colorings where the coloring is a rotation of its inverse (with red and blue swapped). Or something like that. Hmmm.

Let me formalize this a bit. Let me denote the original coloring as a sequence of colors around the octagon. Each position can be either R or B. A rotation by k positions (where k is 0,1,2,...,7) would shift each vertex k places clockwise, say.

So, for each possible rotation k, we can check if applying that rotation to the coloring would result in the blue vertices moving to the positions that were originally red. So, the rotated coloring should have blue where the original was red, and red where the original was blue.

Wait, that's equivalent to saying that the original coloring is equal to the inverse of the rotated coloring, but with colors swapped. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, let's think about the rotated version. Let me denote the original coloring as C. Then, applying rotation k would result in a new coloring C'. For the condition to hold, we must have that in C', every blue vertex in C' was red in C. So, in other words, C' is the complement of C. Because if C had a blue at position i, then C
