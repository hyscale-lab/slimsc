Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with a 50-50 chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that can move all the blue vertices to where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then I have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. The key here is that we can rotate it such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So essentially, for some rotation, the set of blue vertices maps exactly to the set of red vertices.

Wait, but the octagon has 8 vertices. So the number of blue vertices has to equal the number of red vertices? Because otherwise, you can't have a perfect mapping. So the first thing I realize is that the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. Since each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, the number of blue vertices is a binomial random variable with parameters n=8 and p=1/2.

So the number of blue vertices can be 0,1,2,...,8. Only when it's 4 will we have an equal number of red and blue. So maybe the first step is to compute the probability that exactly 4 vertices are blue. But wait, is that the only case? Let me think.

Wait, no. Because even if we have 4 blue vertices, but they might not be arranged in a way that allows a rotation to map them to the red ones. So even if the number of blue and red are equal, the coloring has to be such that the blue vertices are in a position that's a rotation of the red ones.

So the probability that there's a rotation mapping blue to red vertices is the same as the probability that the set of blue vertices is a rotation (by some multiple of 45 degrees) of the set of red vertices.

Hmm. So perhaps I need to count the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

Let me think about the group of rotations of the octagon. The rotation group is cyclic of order 8, right? Because you can rotate by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, which are 8 different rotations.

So for each coloring, we can check whether any of these rotations maps the blue set to the red set.

But how do I count the number of such colorings?

Let me consider that for a coloring to satisfy the condition, the blue set must be a rotation of the red set. And since the red set is the complement of the blue set, it's equivalent to saying that the blue set is a rotation of its own complement.

Wait, that's interesting. So the blue set is a rotation of the red set, which is the same as saying that the blue set is a rotation of its complement. So perhaps the blue set is a rotational shift of itself? Wait, no, because the blue set's complement is the red set.

Wait, maybe I should
