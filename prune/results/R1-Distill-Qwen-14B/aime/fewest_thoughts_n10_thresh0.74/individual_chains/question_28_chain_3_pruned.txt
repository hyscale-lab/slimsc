Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem. Let me try to visualize it first. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, the edges have some specific lengths. The problem states that AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). Hmm, that seems symmetrical in some way.

The question is about finding a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I remember that in a tetrahedron, such a point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

I think the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is related to the volume (V) and the surface area (A). In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. For a tetrahedron, I believe the formula is r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. But wait, is that correct? Let me think. In 3D, the volume is related to the inradius and the total surface area. The formula might be similar to the 2D case but adjusted for three dimensions. So, in 3D, volume is (1/3)*base area*height, and maybe for the inradius, it's 3V divided by the total surface area? So, r = 3V / A. Yeah, that sounds right.

So, to find r, I need to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron and its total surface area.

But wait, the tetrahedron isn't regular because all edges aren't equal. AB, CD are sqrt(41), AC, BD are sqrt(80), and BC, AD are sqrt(89). So, it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron but not regular. I think this is called an isosceles tetrahedron or a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's right. So, in this case, all opposite edges are equal, making it a disphenoid. Disphenoids have some nice properties, like all four faces are congruent triangles, but wait, in this case, the edges are different, so maybe the faces aren't congruent. Let me check.

Each face is a triangle with edges of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, is that so? Let me think. For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, and AC, which are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), and sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD, which are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all faces are triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, the surface area will be four times the area of one such triangle.

Alright, so I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four for the total surface area. Then, I need the volume of the tetrahedron. Hmm, how can I compute the volume?

I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths, there's a formula called the Cayley-Menger determinant. Maybe that would be useful here. The formula is:

Volume = sqrt( | CM | / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

So, the determinant of this 5x5 matrix divided by 288 gives the square of the volume.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edge lengths. Alternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe I can find coordinates for the vertices
