Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says Bob's list has 2024 sets, and we need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand. So Alice picks some set A, and Bob then creates all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of each B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024, and from that, we need to figure out the sum of elements in A.

First, I need to figure out how Bob is constructing these sets B. For each element m in A, Bob can create sets where m is the maximum element. So for each m in A, he can choose any combination of numbers less than m to include in B, as long as the maximum is m.

Wait, so for a given m in A, how many sets B can Bob form where the maximum is exactly m? Well, if m is the maximum, then the other elements in B must be less than m. So the number of possible subsets is the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, plus the set containing only m itself.

But wait, actually, no. Because the set B must be non-empty and finite, and the maximum is m. So for each m in A, the number of sets B with maximum m is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, including the empty subset, but then we have to add 1 to include the set {m} itself. Wait, no, because the empty subset isn't allowed, but when m is the maximum, the other elements can include any combination of the numbers below m, including none. So the number of such sets is 2^{m-1}.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose m is in A. The set B must have maximum m, so all other elements of B must be from {1, 2, ..., m-1}. Each such element can be either included or not. So the number of possible subsets where m is the maximum is 2^{m-1}. Because for each of the m-1 elements, we decide whether to include them or not. But wait, actually, that would include the empty set along with m. But since B must be non-empty, the empty set combined with m is allowed because B would just be {m}, which is non-empty. So yes, for each m, the number of sets B where m is the maximum is 2^{m-1}.

Wait, but wait another second. If m is the maximum, then the set {m} is allowed, which is one set. Then, for all possible non-empty subsets of {1, ..., m-1}, each of these can be combined with m. So the number of such sets would be 1 (the set {m}) plus the number of non-empty subsets of {1, ..., m-1}. The number of non-empty subsets of {1, ..., m-1} is 2^{m-1} - 1. So total sets is 1 + (2^{m-1} - 1) ) = 2^{m-1}.

Yes, that's correct. So for each m in A, the number of sets B with maximum m is 2^{m-1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over all m in A of 2^{m-1}.

Given that the total number is 2024, we have:

Sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

So we need to find a set A where the sum of 2^{m-1} for each m in A is 2024, and then compute the sum of the elements in A.

So the problem reduces to finding a subset A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{m-1} for m in A equals 2024, and then summing the elements of A.

Wait, but 2^{m-1} is
