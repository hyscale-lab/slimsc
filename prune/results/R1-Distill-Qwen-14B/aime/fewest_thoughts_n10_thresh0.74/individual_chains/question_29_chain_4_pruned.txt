Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because a clear picture in my mind will help me tackle it step by step.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting because if four points lie on a circle, they are concyclic or lie on the same circumference, meaning they form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE. Let me note these down:

- ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16.
- Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the points E and F must lie on the line DC. Wait, but DC is a side of the rectangle ABCD. Hmm, but E and F are part of the other rectangle EFGH. So, perhaps the rectangles are arranged such that one side of each rectangle lies along the same line DC.

But wait, E and F are on DC, and D and C are vertices of the first rectangle. So, the line DC is a side of rectangle ABCD, and points E and F are somewhere along this line. So, EFGH is another rectangle attached to DC, with E and F on DC.

Now, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, that's a cyclic quadrilateral. Let me think about the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. Opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, and the power of a point theorem might come into play here.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16, so AD = 16 as well. Rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so EH = 17. Points D, E, C, F are on a straight line, which is DC.

So, if I imagine DC as a horizontal line, with D on the left, C on the right, then E and F are somewhere between D and C. Wait, but EFGH is another rectangle. So, if E and F are on DC, then the sides EF and FG must be sides of the rectangle EFGH. Hmm, but EF is given as 184, and FG is 17.

Wait, so EF is a horizontal side of the rectangle EFGH, since E and F are on DC, which is a
