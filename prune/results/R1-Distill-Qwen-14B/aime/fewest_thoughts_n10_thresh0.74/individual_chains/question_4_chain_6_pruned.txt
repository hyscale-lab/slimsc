Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. It's similar to other impartial games like Nim, where each player has certain moves and the last to move wins. So, I think it's a good idea to model this using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a winning position is one where the player can force a win.

So, let's define P(n) as the position when there are n tokens left. If a player can move to a losing position for the opponent, then the current position is a winning one. If all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent, then the current position is a losing one.

Let me try to figure out the pattern by calculating the first few positions.

Base case:
- P(0): If there are no tokens left, the game is over. The player who just moved has won. So, P(0) is a losing position because the current player cannot make a move.

Wait, actually, in this game, the last token wins. So, if n=0, the game has already ended, but that's the end condition. So, perhaps the losing positions are those where the current player cannot make a move that leads to a win. Let me think again.

Wait, let me redefine: a losing position is when no matter what move you make, the opponent can win. Conversely, a winning position is when at least one move leads to a losing position for the opponent.

So let's build a table for small n to see the pattern.

n | Winning or Losing
0 | Losing (since the player can't move)
1 | Winning (take 1)
2 | Winning (take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I should model it step by step. Let's start from n=0 and move upwards.

n=0: losing position (can't move)
n=1: can take 1, leaving 0 (a losing position for the opponent). So n=1 is a winning position.
n=2: can take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Or take 4, which is impossible because only 2 tokens left. So, all possible moves from n=2 lead to the opponent being in a winning position. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position.
Wait, that can't be right because if I take 1 from n=2, I leave n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, n=2 is a losing position because the only move leads to the opponent winning.

n=3: can take 1, leaving n=2 (a losing position for the opponent). So, n=3 is a winning position because the current player can move to a losing position.
n=4: can take 1
