Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize everything. But since there's already an Asymptote figure provided, maybe I can just refer to that in my mind. 

Let me note that D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, D is the exsymmedian point or something? Wait, no, the exsymmedian is related to the tangents but I'm not sure. Wait, the point where the two tangents intersect is called the ex-pole or something like that. Alternatively, in triangle geometry, the intersection of two tangents is called the ex-pole, and it has some properties.

Wait, maybe I can use the power of a point here. Because D lies outside the circle ω, and DB and DC are tangents to ω. So, by the power of point D with respect to ω, we have DB = DC. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Wait, that's right. So, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC from point D? Or maybe not. Hmm, not sure yet.

So, the main goal is to find AP, which is a chord in the circle passing through A and P. Since P is the second intersection point of AD with ω, AP is the length from A to P. 

I remember that when a line passes through the circumcircle, we can sometimes use power of a point or use similar triangles, or maybe even some inversion properties, but I'm not sure if inversion is needed here.

Another approach is to use coordinate geometry. If I can assign coordinates to points A, B, C, then I can find the equation of the circumcircle ω, find the equations of the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find the equation of line AD, find its other intersection P with ω, and then compute the distance AP.

But that might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, maybe using some properties from triangle geometry, like using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem, or perhaps applying harmonic division or projective geometry concepts.

Wait, another thought: Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, maybe we can use properties of polars. The polar of D with respect to ω is the line BC, because the tangents from D touch ω at B and C. So, BC is the polar of D.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps there's a way to relate AP with other elements.

Alternatively, maybe using power of point A with respect to ω. Wait, but A is on ω, so its power is zero. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, but point D is outside ω, and AD is a secant. So, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². And since AD is a secant, the power of D is also equal to DP * DA. Wait, yes! That seems useful.

So, let's recall that the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² (since DB is a tangent), and also equal to DP * DA, where DP is the length from D to P and DA is the length from D to A.

So, DB² = DP * DA.

If I can find DB, then I can relate DP and DA.

So, let me denote AP as x. So, since AP is the length from A to P, and since A to P is a chord, then the length from A to D is AD, which would be AP + PD? Wait, no. Wait, points are arranged as A, then P, then D along line AD. Because P is the intersection of AD with ω, so starting from A, going through P, then going to D.

So, AP is the distance from A to P, and PD is the distance from P to D. So, AD = AP + PD.

But in terms of power of a point, the power of D is DP * DA. Wait, no, power of point D is equal to DP * (DP + PA). Wait, no, because DA is from D to A, which is the entire length, and DP is from D to P. So, DA = DP + AP.

Wait, actually, the power of point D is DP * DA, but DP is the length from D to P, and DA is from D to A, which is DP + PA. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, points are D---P---A. So, DA is the entire length, which is DP + PA. So, the power of D is DP * (DP + PA) = DB².

Wait, that's correct. So, Power of D: DP * DA = DB².

So, DA = DP + PA. Let me denote PA as x. Then DA = DP + x. So, DP = DA - x.

Wait, but then Power of D: DP * DA = DB² => (DA - x) * DA = DB².

So, DA² - x * DA = DB².

But I don't know DA or DB yet. Hmm. So, maybe I can find DA in terms of other known quantities, or find DB first.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express DB in terms of triangle ABC.

Let me think about triangle ABC. We have sides AB = 5, BC =9, AC=10. So, let me compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. Because ω is the circumcircle of ABC, so knowing the circumradius might help in computing DB.

So, the formula for the circumradius R of triangle ABC is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle.

So, first, let me compute the area Δ using Heron's formula.

Compute semi-perimeter s: (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, area Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[12*42] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, wait, 504 is 16 * 31.5? Wait, no, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5=504. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5) = 4*sqrt(31.5). Hmm, but 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2) = (sqrt(63))/sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(7))/sqrt(2). So, overall, area Δ = 4*(3*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2)) ) = 12*sqrt(7/2) = 12*(sqrt(14)/2) ) = 6*sqrt(14).

Wait, let me check that again. 12*7*3*2 inside the sqrt: 12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5) as I did before. Alternatively, factor 504:

504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 * 7 = 72 * 7. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(72 * 7) = sqrt(36 * 2 * 7) )= 6 * sqrt(14). Oh, that's better. So, Δ = 6*sqrt(14).

So, the area Δ is 6√14. Then, the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Δ) = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14). Let me compute that.

First, numerator: 5*9=45, 45*10=450. Denominator: 4*6=24, 24√14.

So, R = 450 / (24√14) = (450)/(24√14). Let's simplify that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 450 ÷6=75; 24 ÷6=4. So, 75/(4√14). Multiply numerator and denominator by √14 to rationalize:

75√14 / (4*14) = 75√14 /56.

So, R = 75√14 /56.

Hmm, okay. So, the circumradius is 75√14 /56.

Now, back to point D. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, and the power of D is DB² = DC² = (distance from D to ω)^2.

Wait, but maybe I can find DB in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Wait, in triangle ABC, point D is the ex-pole with respect to BC. The length DB can be found using the formula for the distance from the ex-pole to the vertex.

Alternatively, maybe using triangle areas or trigonometry.

Wait, another approach: Since DB and DC are tangents, and we know that in triangle ABC, the lengths of the tangents from D to ω are equal.

Wait, another idea: The point D is the ex-pole of BC, so perhaps we can use the formula DB = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ) * something? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps using coordinates would be better. Let me try to assign coordinate system.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Let me place point A at (10,0) since AC =10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute the coordinates of B.

Given that AB=5, BC=9. So, coordinates of B satisfy distance from A(10,0) is 5, and from C(0,0) is 9.

So, let me set B at (x,y). Then, from C: x² + y² = 81.

From A: (x -10)² + y² =25.

Subtracting the two equations: (x -10)² + y² - (x² + y²) =25 -81 => (x² -20x +100 + y²) -x² -y² = -56 => -20x +100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So, x=7.8, which is 39/5. Then, y² =81 -x² =81 - (39/5)^2.

Compute (39/5)^2: 39^2=1521, 5^2=25, so 1521/25 = 60.84.

So, y²=81 -60.84=20.16. Hmm, 20.16 is 504/25, because 504/25=20.16.

So, y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5. sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5)=4*sqrt(63/2)=4*(3*sqrt(14)/sqrt(2))=4*(3√14)/√2= (12√14)/√2=12√7*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)=12√7. Wait, wait, no, let's correct that.

Wait, 504=16*31.5, but 504=16*31.5? Wait, 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5). Hmm, 31.5=63/2, so sqrt(31.5)=sqrt(63/2)= (sqrt(63))/sqrt(2)= (3*sqrt(7))/sqrt(2). Therefore, sqrt(504)=4*(3*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2))= (12 sqrt(7))/sqrt(2)= 12 sqrt(14)/2=6 sqrt(14).

Wait, no, wait: sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a)*sqrt(b), so sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5)=4*sqrt(63/2)=4*(sqrt(63)/sqrt(2))=4*(3*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2))= (12 sqrt(7))/sqrt(2)= 12 sqrt(7/2)= 12*(sqrt(14)/2)=6 sqrt(14). Ah, yes, right.

So, sqrt(504)=6√14. So, y=6√14/5. So, point B has coordinates (39/5, 6√14/5). So, (7.8, approximately 4.4899), as in the Asymptote code.

So, now I have coordinates for points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Next, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω.

First, let me find the equation of ω. Since the circumcircle passes through A, B, C.

We can find the equation using the general circle equation: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0.

Plug in points A(10,0): 100 + 0 + 10D +0 + F=0 => 10D + F = -100. (1)

Point C(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 => F=0. Wait, but from equation (1), 10D +0 = -100 => D= -10.

So, equation becomes x² + y² -10x + Ey =0.

Now, plug in point B: (39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) =0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2= (1521)/25=60.84.

(6√14/5)^2= (36*14)/25=504/25=20.16.

10*(39/5)=78.

So, equation becomes 60.84 + 20.16 -78 + (6√14/5) E =0.

Compute 60.84 +20.16=81. 81 -78=3.

So, 3 + (6√14/5) E=0 => (6√14/5) E= -3 => E= (-3)*(5)/(6√14)= (-15)/(6√14)= (-5)/(2√14).

Rationalize denominator: (-5√14)/(2*14)= (-5√14)/28.

So, E= (-5√14)/28.

Therefore, equation of ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y=0.

Alternatively, to write it in standard form, complete the squares.

x² -10x + y² - (5√14/28)y =0.

Complete the square for x: (x² -10x +25) = (x -5)^2.

For y: coefficient of y is -(5√14)/28. Half of that is -(5√14)/56. Square is (25*14)/(56²)= (350)/(3136)= 25/224.

So, add (25/224) to both sides:

(x -5)^2 + y² - (5√14/28)y +25/224 =25.

Wait, perhaps better to compute the standard form:

x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Center at (h,k) where h=5, and k= (5√14)/(2*28)= (5√14)/56.

Wait, wait, the general equation is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0, with center (-D/2, -E/2), radius sqrt( (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F ).

So, here, D= -10, E= -5√14/28, F=0.

So, center is at (-D/2, -E/2)= (5, (5√14)/(56)).

Radius squared is (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F.

Compute D/2=5, E/2= (-5√14)/56.

So, (5)^2 + ((-5√14)/56)^2 -0=25 + (25*14)/(56²).

25 + (350)/(3136)=25 + 25/224≈25 + ~0.1116≈25.1116.

Wait, exact value:

Compute 350/3136: divide numerator and denominator by 14: 25/224.

So, radius squared is 25 +25/224= (25*224 +25)/224=25*(224 +1)/224=25*225/224= (625*9)/224=5625/224.

So, radius is sqrt(5625/224)=75/sqrt(224)=75/(sqrt(16*14))=75/(4√14)= (75√14)/56, which matches earlier calculation. So, correct.

Now, to find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

The tangent at a point (x1,y1) on the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0 is given by:

xx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0.

Wait, another way: the equation can be written as T=0, where T is the tangent at (x1,y1):

x x1 + y y1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0.

Alternatively, I think that's correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the point-slope form, but since I have the coordinates, maybe I can compute the tangent.

Alternatively, since I have the center of the circle at (5, 5√14/56), the tangent at point B is perpendicular to the radius at B.

So, the slope of radius OB (O is center) is (yB - yO)/(xB - xO). So, let me compute that.

Point B: (39/5, 6√14/5). Center O: (5, 5√14/56).

Compute xO=5=25/5, so xB -xO= (39/5 -25/5)=14/5.

yB - yO= (6√14/5 -5√14/56)= (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5)/(5*56)= (336√14 -25√14)/280= (311√14)/280.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5)= (311√14/280)*(5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 311√14 / (3920/5)=311√14/784.

Wait, 3920/5=784.

So, slope of OB is (311√14)/784.

Then, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: m= -784/(311√14).

To rationalize, we can write it as (-784√14)/(311*14)= (-56√14)/311.

So, the slope of tangent at B is (-56√14)/311.

Similarly, the tangent at C: point C is (0,0). The radius OC is from O(5, 5√14/56) to C(0,0). The slope is (5√14/56 -0)/(5 -0)= (√14)/56 *5= √14/11.2? Wait, no.

Wait, the slope is (yO - yC)/(xO - xC)= (5√14/56 -0)/(5 -0)= (5√14)/56 /5= √14/56.

So, slope of OC is √14/56.

Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: m= -56/√14= -56√14/14= -4√14.

So, the tangent at C has slope -4√14.

Now, with the slopes of the two tangents, and points B and C, we can find the equations of the tangents.

First, tangent at B: passes through B(39/5, 6√14/5) with slope m1= (-56√14)/311.

So, equation is y - 6√14/5 = [(-56√14)/311](x -39/5).

Similarly, tangent at C: passes through C(0,0) with slope m2= -4√14.

So, equation is y= -4√14 x.

Now, we can find the intersection point D of these two tangents.

So, let me solve the two equations:

1. y = -4√14 x.

2. y - 6√14/5 = [(-56√14)/311](x -39/5).

Substitute y from equation 1 into equation 2:

-4√14 x - 6√14/5 = [(-56√14)/311](x -39/5).

Let me divide both sides by √14 to simplify:

-4x -6/5 = [(-56)/311](x -39/5).

Multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominator:

-4x*311 - (6/5)*311 = -56(x -39/5).

Compute each term:

-4*311= -1244, so -1244x.

(6/5)*311= (6*311)/5= 1866/5=373.2.

So, left side: -1244x -373.2.

Right side: -56x + (56*39)/5= -56x + (2184)/5= -56x +436.8.

So, equation becomes:

-1244x -373.2 = -56x +436.8.

Bring all terms to left:

-1244x +56x -373.2 -436.8 =0.

Compute:

-1188x -810=0 => -1188x=810 => x= -810/1188.

Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 18: 810/18=45, 1188/18=66.

So, x= -45/66= -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Then, from equation 1, y= -4√14 x= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D has coordinates (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we need to find the equation of line AD.

Point A is at (10,0), point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Compute the slope of AD: m= (yD - yA)/(xD - xA)= (30√14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10)= (30√14/11)/( (-15/22 -220/22))= (30√14/11)/( (-235/22))= (30√14/11)*(-22/235)= (30√14 * -22)/(11*235).

Simplify:

11 and 22: 22/11=2.

So, (30√14 * -2)/235= (-60√14)/235.

Simplify numerator and denominator by 5: 60/5=12, 235/5=47.

So, slope m= (-12√14)/47.

So, equation of AD: y -0= [(-12√14)/47](x -10).

So, y= [(-12√14)/47]x + 120√14/47.

Now, find the intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle ω.

We have the equation of ω: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

And the equation of AD: y= [(-12√14)/47]x + 120√14/47.

Substitute y into ω's equation.

So, let me denote y = m x + c, where m= (-12√14)/47, c=120√14/47.

Substitute into ω equation:

x² + (m x + c)^2 -10x - (5√14/28)(m x +c )=0.

Compute each term:

First, x².

Second, (m x +c)^2= m² x² + 2 m c x + c².

Third, -10x.

Fourth, -(5√14/28)(m x +c )= - (5√14/28) m x - (5√14/28)c.

So, putting all together:

x² + m² x² + 2 m c x + c² -10x - (5√14/28) m x - (5√14/28)c =0.

Combine like terms:

(1 + m²) x² + [2 m c -10 - (5√14/28) m ] x + [c² - (5√14/28)c ]=0.

This is a quadratic in x. Since point A(10,0) is on both the line AD and the circle, x=10 is a root. So, the other root will correspond to point P.

Let me denote this quadratic as A x² + B x + C =0, where:

A=1 + m².

B=2 m c -10 - (5√14/28) m.

C= c² - (5√14/28)c.

So, the product of the roots is C/A. One root is x=10, the other is x_p= C/(A *10).

So, AP is the distance between A(10,0) and P(x_p, y_p). But since we have the x-coordinate of P, we can compute AP.

Alternatively, since we know x_p, we can compute AP via the distance formula, but it's easier to find AP using the power of point A... Wait, but A is on the circle, so power of A is zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using parametric equations.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find x_p as C/(A *10), but let's compute A, B, C.

Compute m= (-12√14)/47, c=120√14/47.

Compute A=1 + m²=1 + (144*14)/(47²)=1 + (2016)/2209= (2209 +2016)/2209=4225/2209.

Compute B=2*m*c -10 - (5√14/28)m.

Compute 2*m*c: 2*(-12√14/47)*(120√14/47)=2*(-12*120)*(14)/(47²)=2*(-1440)*(14)/2209.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

m*c= (-12√14/47)*(120√14/47)= (-12*120)*(√14 *√14)/(47²)= (-1440)*(14)/(2209)= (-20160)/2209.

So, 2*m*c= (-40320)/2209.

Then, -(5√14/28)*m= -(5√14/28)*(-12√14)/47= (60*14)/(28*47)= (840)/(1316)= 840/1316. Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 210/329.

So, B= (-40320/2209) -10 +210/329.

Wait, let me convert all terms to have denominator 2209.

-40320/2209 is already in 2209.

-10= -10*2209/2209= -22090/2209.

210/329= (210*7)/(329*7)=1470/2303. Wait, 329*7=2303? Wait, 329*7=2303? Let me compute 329*7: 300*7=2100, 29*7=203, total 2303. So, 210/329=1470/2303.

But 2303 is 2209 +94= approximately. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps find a common denominator.

Alternatively, compute each term in decimals to approximate, but that might be messy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the quadratic equation.

Wait, but maybe since x=10 is a root, we can factor it out.

The quadratic equation is A x² + B x + C =0, with x=10 being a root.

So, we can write it as (x -10)(something)=0.

Let me perform polynomial division.

Let me write the quadratic as:

(4225/2209)x² + Bx + C=0.

We can factor out (x -10):

Let me write it as (x -10)(Kx + L)=0.

Multiplying out: Kx² + Lx -10Kx -10L= Kx² + (L -10K)x -10L.

Compare with original quadratic:

Coefficient of x²: K=4225/2209.

Coefficient of x: L -10K = B.

Constant term: -10L = C.

So, from constant term: L= -C/10.

From coefficient of x: L -10K = B => (-C/10) -10*(4225/2209)= B.

So, let's compute C.

C= c² - (5√14/28)c.

Compute c²= (120√14/47)^2= (14400*14)/2209= 201600/2209.

Compute (5√14/28)c= (5√14/28)*(120√14/47)= (600*14)/ (28*47)= (8400)/(1316)= 8400/1316.

Simplify 8400/1316: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 2100/329.

So, (5√14/28)c=2100/329.

Therefore, C= 201600/2209 -2100/329.

Convert to common denominator, which is 2209.

2100/329= (2100*6.72)/2209? Wait, 329*6=2000- no, wait 329*6=1974, 329*6.72≈2209. So, 2209=329*6.72?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 2100/329 = (2100*1)/329. Let me compute 2209=47²=2209. 329 is 7*47=329. So, 329=7*47, 2209=47². So, 2100/329=2100/(7*47)=300/47.

So, 2100/329=300/47.

So, C=201600/2209 -300/47.

Convert 300/47 to denominator 2209: 300/47= (300*47)/2209=14100/2209.

So, C=201600/2209 -14100/2209= (201600 -14100)/2209=187500/2209.

So, C=187500/2209.

Then, from earlier, L= -C/10= -(187500/2209)/10= -18750/2209.

From coefficient of x: L -10K = B.

We have L= -18750/2209, K=4225/2209.

So, L -10K= (-18750/2209) -10*(4225/2209)= (-18750 -42250)/2209= (-61000)/2209.

But earlier, B= (-40320/2209) -10 +210/329.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should compute B numerically.

Compute each term:

B= 2 m c -10 - (5√14/28)m.

We have m= (-12√14)/47, c=120√14/47.

Compute 2 m c=2*(-12√14/47)*(120√14/47)= 2*(-1440 *14)/(47²)=2*(-20160)/2209= -40320/2209≈-18.25.

Next term: -10.

Third term: -(5√14/28)*m= -(5√14/28)*(-12√14)/47= (60*14)/(28*47)= (840)/(1316)= 0.638.

So, B≈ -18.25 -10 +0.638≈-27.612.

But let me compute exact value:

Compute 2 m c= (-40320)/2209.

Compute -(5√14/28)m= (5√14/28)*(12√14)/47= (60*14)/(28*47)= (840)/(1316)= 210/329.

So, B= (-40320/2209) -10 +210/329.

Convert all to denominator 2209:

-40320/2209.

-10= -22090/2209.

210/329= (210*6.72)/2209? Wait, earlier we saw that 329=7*47, 2209=47²=47*47.

So, 210/329=210/(7*47)=30/47= (30*47)/2209=1410/2209.

Wait, no, 30/47 is 30/47, not 1410/2209. Wait, 30/47= (30*47)/2209=1410/2209. So, yes.

So, 210/329=30/47=1410/2209.

So, B= (-40320 + (-22090) +1410)/2209= (-40320 -22090 +1410)/2209.

Compute numerator:

-40320 -22090= -62410.

-62410 +1410= -61000.

So, B= -61000/2209.

So, yes, B= -61000/2209.

So, now equation is:

(4225/2209)x² + (-61000/2209)x + 187500/2209=0.

Multiply both sides by 2209 to eliminate denominators:

4225x² -61000x +187500=0.

We can simplify this equation.

Divide all terms by 25:

4225/25=169, 61000/25=2440, 187500/25=7500.

So, 169x² -2440x +7500=0.

This is a quadratic equation. We know x=10 is a root, so let's factor it.

Divide 169x² -2440x +7500 by (x -10).

Using polynomial division:

Divide 169x² -2440x +7500 by (x -10).

First term: 169x² /x=169x. Multiply (x -10) by 169x: 169x² -1690x.

Subtract from original: (-2440x +1690x) +7500= (-750x) +7500.

Next term: -750x /x= -750. Multiply (x -10) by -750: -750x +7500.

Subtract: (7500 -7500)=0.

So, the quadratic factors as (x -10)(169x -750)=0.

So, the roots are x=10 and x=750/169.

So, the other intersection point P has x-coordinate 750/169.

So, x_p=750/169.

Now, find y_p using equation of AD: y= [(-12√14)/47]x + 120√14/47.

So, y_p= [(-12√14)/47]*(750/169) + 120√14/47.

Compute:

First term: (-12√14)*(750)/(47*169)= (-9000√14)/(7883).

Second term: 120√14/47= (120√14 *169)/(47*169)= (20280√14)/7883.

So, y_p= (-9000√14 +20280√14)/7883= (11280√14)/7883.

Simplify numerator: 11280 and 7883.

Wait, 7883 is 169*47=7883. 169*47=7883.

11280 ÷169: 169*66=11154, 11280-11154=126. So, 66 +126/169=66*(169) +126= not helpful. Maybe factor numerator and denominator.

11280= 11280= 16*705=16*5*141=16*5*3*47.

Wait, 11280= 1128*10= (8*141)*10=8*5*3*47*2= 2^4 *3 *5 *47.

Denominator 7883=47*169=47*13².

So, 11280√14 /7883= (16*5*3*47 *√14)/(47*13²)= (16*5*3 *√14)/(13²).

Simplify: 16*5*3=240.

So, y_p= (240√14)/(169).

So, coordinates of P are (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, we need to find AP, the distance between A(10,0) and P(750/169,240√14/169).

Compute the differences:

Δx=750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (-940)/169.

Δy=240√14/169 -0=240√14/169.

So, AP= sqrt[ (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 ]= sqrt[ ( (-940/169)^2 ) + (240√14/169)^2 ].

Factor out (1/169)^2:

AP= sqrt[ (940² + (240√14)^2 ) / (169²) ]= (1/169)*sqrt(940² + (240√14)^2 ).

Compute numerator inside sqrt:

940²= (900 +40)^2=900² +2*900*40 +40²=810000 +72000 +1600=883600.

(240√14)^2=240² *14=57600 *14=806400.

So, total=883600 +806400=1,690,000.

So, sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.

Thus, AP=1300 /169= 1300 ÷13²=1300/(13*13)= (100*13)/(13*13)=100/13.

Wait, 1300 ÷13=100, so 1300/169=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

So, m=100, n=13, which are coprime.

Thus, m +n=113.


The problem involves finding the length of \( AP \) in triangle \( ABC \) inscribed in a circle \( \omega \). The tangents at \( B \) and \( C \) intersect at \( D \), and \( AD \) intersects \( \omega \) again at \( P \). Given \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \), we use coordinate geometry and properties of circles to find \( AP \).

1. **Coordinates of Points**:
   - Place \( C \) at the origin \((0,0)\) and \( A \) at \((10,0)\).
   - Determine coordinates of \( B \) using the distance formula: \( B = \left( \frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5} \right) \).

2. **Equation of Circumcircle**:
   - The circumcircle \( \omega \) passes through \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). Its equation is derived as \( x^2 + y^2 - 10x - \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{28}y = 0 \).

3. **Equations of Tangents**:
   - The tangent at \( B \) has slope \( -\frac{56\sqrt{14}}{311} \).
   - The tangent at \( C \) has slope \( -4\sqrt{14} \).

4. **Intersection Point \( D \)**:
   - Solve the equations of the tangents to find \( D \) at \( \left( -\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11} \right) \).

5. **Equation of Line \( AD \)**:
   - The line \( AD \) has slope \( -\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47} \) and equation \( y = -\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47}x + \frac{120\sqrt{14}}{47} \).

6. **Intersection with Circumcircle**:
   - Substitute the equation of \( AD \) into \( \omega \) to find the intersection points. One root is \( x = 10 \) (point \( A \)), and the other is \( x = \frac{750}{169} \) (point \( P \)).

7. **Coordinates of \( P \)**:
   - Using the equation of \( AD \), find \( P \) at \( \left( \frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169} \right) \).

8. **Distance \( AP \)**:
   - Calculate the distance between \( A(10,0) \) and \( P \) using the distance formula. The result is \( AP = \frac{100}{13} \).

Thus, \( AP = \frac{100}{13} \), and \( m + n = 100 + 13 = 113 \).

\boxed{113}
