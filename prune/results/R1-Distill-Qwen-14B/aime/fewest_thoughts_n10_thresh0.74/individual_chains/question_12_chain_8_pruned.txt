Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when you read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999, and when you read them top to bottom, their sum is 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 008 and the bottom row is 991. So, 008 + 991 equals 999, and 0 + 99 + 81 equals 99. Interesting.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, which means there are two rows and three columns. Let's denote each cell with variables. Let me assign letters to each cell to make it easier. Let's say the top row has cells A, B, C, and the bottom row has cells D, E, F. So the grid looks like:

| A | B | C |
|---|---|---|
| D | E | F |

Now, reading left to right gives two numbers: the top row ABC and the bottom row DEF. Their sum should be 999. So ABC + DEF = 999.

Reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So the first column is AD, the second is BE, and the third is CF. Their sum should be 99. So AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, let me make sure. Each column is read as a number? So AD is a two-digit number where A is the tens digit and D is the units digit. Same for BE and CF. So each column's sum is the sum of these two-digit numbers, and the total is 99.

So, the problem is to assign digits (0-9) to each cell such that:

1. The number ABC + DEF = 999.
2. The number AD + BE + CF = 99.

I need to find how many such assignments exist.

Let me break down each condition.

First, considering the sum ABC + DEF = 999. Since ABC is a three-digit number and DEF is another three-digit number, their sum is 999. Let me write this as:

ABC + DEF = 999.

Which can be rewritten as:

100*A + 10*B + C + 100*D + 10*E + F = 999.

Simplify:

100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Which is:

100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Let me denote:

Let S1 = A + D,

S2 = B + E,

S3 = C + F.

So, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

But 999 is 999 in the hundreds, tens, units place. So:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 9*100 + 9*10 + 9.

Which implies that:

S1 = 9,

S2 = 9,

S3 = 9.

So, each of S1, S2, S3 must equal 9.

So, we have:

A + D = 9,

B + E = 9,

C + F = 9.

That's the first condition.

Now, moving to the second condition: AD + BE + CF = 99.

AD is a two-digit number, so it's equal to 10*A + D.

Similarly, BE = 10*B + E,

and CF = 10*C + F.

So, the sum is:

(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99.

Let me write this equation out.

10*A + D + 10*B + E + 10*C + F = 99.

I can rearrange the terms:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Hmm, interesting. So,

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Wait, but from the first condition, we have A + D =9, B + E=9, C + F=9.

So, adding these three equations:

(A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = 9 + 9 + 9 =27.

Which is:

(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) =27.

Let me denote:

Let S4 = A + B + C,

and S5 = D + E + F.

So, S4 + S5 =27.

From the second condition, we have:

10*S4 + S5 =99.

So now, we have two equations:

1) S4 + S5 =
