Okay, so I have this geometry problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let's try to visualize this. I have two rectangles. Let me sketch it out in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC with lengths 107 and 16, respectively. So, AB is the longer side. Rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG =17. Wait, EF is much longer than AB, but FG is shorter than BC. Interesting.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that connects D and C, E and F must be somewhere along this line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. So, maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.

Let me think about the rectangles. In rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH =17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the line DEF C is a straight line. So, the points D and C are on this line, and E and F are between them or maybe on the extensions.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, D is one vertex, and C is the opposite vertex. Similarly, in EFGH, E and F are adjacent vertices since they are connected by EF. So, the line D-E-F-C must be a straight line.

Wait, perhaps the rectangles are arranged such that EFGH is adjacent to ABCD along this line. I'm a bit confused; maybe I should assign coordinates to these points to make it clearer.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is (0,0), then C would be at (107,0) because BC is 16, which is the height, so moving up from B. Wait, no, actually, AB is 107, so AB is the length. Let me clarify the coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates systematically. Let's say rectangle ABCD has points A, B, C, D in order. So, if D is at (0,0), then since AD is 16, point A would be at (0,16). Then, AB is 107, so point B would be at (107
