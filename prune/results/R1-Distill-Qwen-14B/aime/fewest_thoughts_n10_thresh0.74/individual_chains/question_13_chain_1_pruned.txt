Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes. Now, if she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, I need to find how many minutes the walk takes her, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is that the total time she spends includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time 't'. Since the coffee shop time is the same in both scenarios, I can probably set up equations to solve for 's' and 't'.

Let me write down the given information:

1. When walking at speed s km/h:
   - Distance = 9 km
   - Total time = 4 hours = 4*60 = 240 minutes
   - So, walking time + t = 240 minutes.

2. When walking at speed (s + 2) km/h:
   - Distance = 9 km
   - Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2*60 +24 = 120 +24 = 144 minutes
   - So, walking time + t = 144 minutes.

Wait, so the walking time is different in each case because the speed is different, but the coffee shop time 't' is the same. So, if I can find the walking time for each case, I can set up equations to solve for 's' and 't'.

Let me denote:

- Walking time at speed s: T1
- Walking time at speed s+2: T2

So,

From first scenario: T1 + t = 240
From second scenario: T2 + t = 144

But I also know that:

- T1 = Distance / speed = 9 / s hours
- T2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours

Wait, but the time I added above is in minutes, so maybe I should convert everything to minutes to make it consistent.

Yes, let's convert T1 and T2 into minutes.

So,

T1 (in minutes) = (9 / s) * 60
T2 (in minutes) = (9 / (s + 2)) * 60

So the equations become:

(9*60)/s + t = 240  --- Equation 1
(9*60)/(s + 2) + t = 144  --- Equation 2

Now, I can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate 't'.

So,

(9*60)/s - (9*60)/(s + 2) = 240 - 144

Let me compute the right side first: 240 -144 = 96

Left side: 9*60 [1/s - 1/(s+2)]

Compute 9*60: 9*60=540

So,

540 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 96

Let me write that as:

540 * [ (s + 2 - s) / (s(s + 2)) ) ] = 96

Simplify numerator:

s + 2 - s = 2

So,

540 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 96

Which is,

(540 * 2) / (s(s + 2)) = 96

540 * 2 = 1080

So,

1080 / (s(s + 2)) = 96

Now, let me solve for s(s + 2):

s(s + 2) = 1080 / 96

Compute 1080 / 96: Let's see, 96 *11 = 1056, so 1080 -1056=24, so 11.25?

Wait: 96 * 11 = 1056; 1080 -1056=24. 24 is 96 * 0.25, so yes, 11.25.

Wait, 96 * 11.25 = 1080.

So,

s(s + 2) = 11.25

So now, this is a quadratic equation.

Let me write it as:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Hmm, solving for s.

Using quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Where a=1, b=2, c= -11.25

Compute discriminant: b² -4ac = (2)^2 -4*1*(-11.25) = 4 +45 = 49

So sqrt(49)=7

So,

s = [-2 ±7]/2

We have two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5

s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s=2.5 km/h.

Alright, so s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t.

From Equation 1:

(9*60)/s + t = 240

Compute (9*60)/2.5:

9*60=540

540 /2.5 = 540 ÷ 2.5

Hmm, 540 ÷2.5 = 540 ÷ (5/2) )= 540 * 2/5 = (540 *2)/5 = 1080/5 = 216 minutes.

So,

216 + t = 240

So t = 240 -216 =24 minutes.

So t is 24 minutes.

Wait, let me verify with equation 2.

Equation 2:

(9*60)/(s +2) + t = 144

s + 2 = 2.5 +2=4.5

So 9*60=540

540 /4.5 = 120 minutes.

So,

120 + t =144

t=24, which matches. Good.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

Find the total time, including 't' minutes.

So first, compute the walking time at 3 km/h.

Walking time = distance / speed = 9 /3 =3 hours.

Convert that into minutes: 3*60=180 minutes.

Then, add the coffee shop time t=24 minutes.

Total time=180 +24=204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Let me go through the steps again.

First, found that s=2.5 km/h, t=24 minutes.

When she walks at s +1/2, which is 3 km/h, the walking time is 9/3=3 hours=180 minutes. Adding coffee time, 180+24=2
