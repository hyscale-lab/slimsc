Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which I assume means moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, right? Because an 8x8 grid would require moving 7 squares in each direction, but wait, actually, no. Wait, no, an 8x8 grid has 9 points along each side. So to go from the lower left to the upper right, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order.

But the catch here is that the path must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay. So what does it mean to change direction? Well, each time you switch from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if you go R, R, R, U, U, U, R, R, U, U, U, U, that's several direction changes.

Wait, to clarify, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches minus one, maybe? Or is it the number of runs? Let's think. A path like R, R, U, U is two direction changes. Because you start going right, then switch once to up. So the number of direction changes is equal to the number of runs minus one. Because each run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, for example, in the path RRUUURRUU, there are four runs: R, U, R, U. So that's three direction changes.

Wait, no. Wait, RRUUURRUU: starts with R, then switches to U (that's one change), then back to R (two changes), then back to U (three changes). So yes, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of runs minus one. So if the path has k runs, then the number of direction changes is k - 1.

So the problem states that the path changes direction exactly four times. So that means the number of runs is 5, right? Because 4 changes correspond to 5 runs.

So, in other words, the path alternates between right
