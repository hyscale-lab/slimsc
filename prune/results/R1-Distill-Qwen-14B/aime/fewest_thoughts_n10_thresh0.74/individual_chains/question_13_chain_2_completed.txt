Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

So, Aya goes for a walk every morning, and it's 9 kilometers long. After her walk, she stops at a coffee shop. The problem is about figuring out how much time her walk takes when she walks at a slightly different speed, including the time she spends in the coffee shop.

From the problem, I see two different scenarios:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, her total time is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

And the question is, if she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how long does her walk take, including the coffee shop time?

Hmm, okay. So, in both cases, the time includes the coffee shop stop, which is 't' minutes. But the walking time itself depends on her speed.

First, let me note down the given information:

- Distance of the walk: 9 km
- First scenario: speed = s km/h, total time = 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop.
- Second scenario: speed = s + 2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes, which includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop.
- We need to find the total time when speed = s + 1/2 km/h, including 't' minutes.

So, the key here is that the time she spends in the coffee shop is the same in both scenarios, right? So, 't' is a constant. Therefore, the difference in total time between the two scenarios must be due to the difference in walking time.

Let me think about how to model this.

In the first scenario:

- Let the walking time be T1 hours. Then, the total time is T1 + t/60 = 4 hours. Because t is in minutes, so to add it to hours, I have to convert it to hours by dividing by 60.

Similarly, in the second scenario:

- Let the walking time be T2 hours. Then, T2 + t/60 = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours. So, T2 + t/60 = 2.4 hours.

Now, since walking time depends on speed and distance, I can write:

T1 = 9 / s
T2 = 9 / (s + 2)

So, substituting into the equations:

For the first scenario: (9/s) + (t/60) = 4  ...(1)

For the second scenario: (9/(s+2)) + (t/60) = 2.4  ...(2)

So now, I have two equations with two unknowns: s and t.

I can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate t.

Equation (1) - Equation (2):

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify left side:

9/s - 9/(s+2) + t/60 - t/60 = 1.6

So, the t terms cancel out.

So, 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Now, I can factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 1.6

Let me compute the expression in the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s+2) = [ (s+2) - s ] / [s(s+2)] = 2 / [s(s+2)]

So, 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 1.6

Simplify:

18 / [s(s+2)] = 1.6

So, 18 = 1.6 * s(s+2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s+2). Hmm, 1.6 is 8/5, so maybe I can write this as fractions to make it easier.

18 = (8/5) * s(s + 2)

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:

90 = 8 * s(s + 2)

So, 8s(s+2) = 90

Divide both sides by 2:

4s(s + 2) = 45

So, expand the left side:

4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation: 4s² +8s -45 = 0

I can solve this using the quadratic formula. Let me write the quadratic as:

4s² +8s -45 =0

So, a=4, b=8, c=-45

Quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a)

Compute discriminant D:

D = b² -4ac = (8)^2 -4*(4)*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

sqrt(784) = 28

So, s = [ -8 ±28 ] / (2*4) = ( -8 ±28 ) /8

We have two solutions:

1. s = (-8 +28)/8 = (20)/8=2.5

2. s = (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8= -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s=2.5 km/h

So, s=2.5 km/h.

Now, I can find 't' using one of the earlier equations.

Let's use equation (1):

T1 + t/60 =4

T1=9/s=9/2.5=3.6 hours

So, 3.6 + t/60=4

So, t/60=0.4 hours

t=0.4 *60=24 minutes

So, t=24 minutes.

Now, the question is, if Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h, what's the total time, including t.

s=2.5 km/h, so s +1/2= 2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, her new speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time is 9 km /3 km/h=3 hours.

Including t=24 minutes, which is 24/60=0.4 hours.

So, total time is 3 +0.4=3.4 hours.

Convert 0.4 hours to minutes: 0.4*60=24 minutes.

Wait, so 3 hours plus 24 minutes is 3 hours 24 minutes.

But let me confirm. 

Wait, 3.4 hours is 3 hours plus 0.4 hours. 0.4 hours is 24 minutes, so yeah, 3:24.

Alternatively, just to double-check, let's make sure all the steps make sense.

So, s=2.5 km/h.

First scenario: 9 km at 2.5 km/h is indeed 9/2.5=3.6 hours, which is 3 hours 36 minutes. Then, adding 24 minutes gives 4 hours, which matches the first scenario.

Second scenario: speed is 2.5+2=4.5 km/h. Walking time is 9/4.5=2 hours. Adding 24 minutes gives 2 hours 24 minutes, which matches the second scenario.

So, that seems correct.

Now, third scenario: speed is 2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

Walking time is 9/3=3 hours. Adding 24 minutes, the total time is 3 hours 24 minutes.

So, the answer is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is 3*60 +24= 180+24=204 minutes.

Wait, but the problem says to find the number of minutes, including t. So, the walking time is 3 hours (180 minutes) plus t=24 minutes, so total 204 minutes.

Alternatively, as 3.4 hours, but the question asks for minutes, so 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure that 3.4 hours is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is 3*60=180 +24=204. Yep.

So, the final answer is 204 minutes.


Aya walks 9 kilometers each morning. When walking at a constant speed of \( s \) km/h, her total time is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in a coffee shop. When walking at \( s + 2 \) km/h, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, also including \( t \) minutes. We need to find the total time when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including \( t \) minutes.

First, we set up the equations for the two scenarios:

1. **First scenario**:  
   Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours  
   Total time: \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \)  
   Equation:  
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \tag{1}
   \]

2. **Second scenario**:  
   Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s + 2} \) hours  
   Total time: \( \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \)  
   Equation:  
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \tag{2}
   \]

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate \( t \):  
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6  
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 1.6  
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6  
\]  
Solving for \( s \):  
\[
18 = 1.6 \cdot s(s + 2)  
90 = 8s(s + 2)  
4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0  
\]  
Using the quadratic formula:  
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8} = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}  
\]  
Taking the positive solution:  
\[
s = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]

Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into equation (1) to find \( t \):  
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4  
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4  
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]

For the third scenario, walking at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:  
Walking time: \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours  
Total time: \( 3 \) hours \( + 24 \) minutes = \( 3 \) hours \( 24 \) minutes = \( 204 \) minutes.

**Answer**:  
\[
\boxed{204}
\]
