Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q. 

Hmm, let me think. The sphere that can contain a rectangular box would have its diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the space diagonal is the longest distance inside the box, so the sphere must at least have a diameter equal to that to contain the box. So, the radius would be half of that space diagonal.

So, if I can find the maximum space diagonal among all such boxes, then the radius r would be half of that. Then, I can compute r squared.

But wait, how do I find the maximum space diagonal? Because the space diagonal depends on the dimensions of the box. But the surface area and volume are fixed, so I can express the space diagonal in terms of the dimensions and then use optimization techniques to find its maximum.

So, let me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. Then, the surface area S is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume V is xyz = 23.

The space diagonal D is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, r = D/2, and r² = D² /4. So, I need to maximize D², which is x² + y² + z², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, this becomes a constrained optimization problem. I need to maximize x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, how do I approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? Or perhaps express variables in terms of each other?

Alternatively, maybe I can use AM ≥ GM or other inequalities, but I'm not sure. Let me try setting up the Lagrangian.

Let me define the function to maximize as f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

The constraints are:
g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0
h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

So, we can set up the Lagrangian as:
L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and setting them to zero.

Partial derivative with respect to x:
2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0
Similarly for y:
2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0
And for z:
2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0

So, we have these three equations:

(1) 2x = λ(2y + 2z) + μ yz

(2) 2y = λ(2x + 2z) + μ xz

(3) 2z = λ(2x + 2y) + μ xy

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a relationship between x, y, z. Let me assume that x = y = z, but wait, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z = a, then surface area S = 6a² = 54 ⇒ a² = 9 ⇒ a = 3. Then, volume would be a³ = 27, but in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube case isn't applicable here. So, the box isn't a cube, and x, y, z must be different.

Alternatively, maybe two variables are equal? Let me suppose that x = y, but z is different. Then, maybe we can reduce the problem to two variables.

Let me try setting x = y. So, x = y, and z is another variable.

Then, surface area becomes 2(x² + xz + xz) = 2x² + 4xz = 54.

Volume becomes x * x * z = x² z = 23.

So, now we have two equations:

2x² + 4xz = 54 ⇒ x² + 2xz = 27.

x² z = 23 ⇒ z = 23
