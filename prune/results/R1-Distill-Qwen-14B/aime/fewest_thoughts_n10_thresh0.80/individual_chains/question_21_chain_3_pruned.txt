Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what it means. 

So, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base b where there are over ten such numbers n.

Let me break down the problem.

First, let's represent n in base b. Since n has exactly two digits in base b, it can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a must be between 1 and b-1 (since it's the leading digit), and c must be between 0 and b-1.

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Let me denote sqrt(n) as k, where k is a positive integer. Then, n = k^2.

So, putting it all together, for n to be b-eautiful, it must satisfy:

1. n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.
2. a + c = k, where k is a positive integer.
3. n = k^2.

So, substituting n = k^2 into the first equation, we have:

k^2 = a*b + c.

But since a + c = k, we can express c as c = k - a. Substituting this into the equation:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a).

Simplify that:

k^2 = a*b + k - a.

Let me rearrange the terms:

k^2 - k = a*(b - 1).

So, this gives us an equation:

a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).

But a has to be an integer between 1 and b-1. So, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result a must be within 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1.

So, for each base b, we can find the number of integers k such that:

1. (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1).
2. The resulting a is between 1 and b-1.
3. c = k - a must be between 0 and b-1.

So, the problem reduces to, for each b, finding the number of k's that satisfy these conditions. We need to find the smallest b where this number exceeds 10.

Hmm, so to approach this, perhaps I can express the equation as:

k^2 - k ≡ 0 mod (b - 1).

Which implies that k(k - 1) ≡ 0 mod (b - 1).

Since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, this means that either k ≡ 0 mod (b - 1) or (k - 1) ≡ 0 mod (b - 1). Alternatively, it could be that one divides (b - 1) and the other the remaining factor, but since k and k-1 are coprime, it's more straightforward to say that (b - 1) must divide k(k - 1).

But given that k and k-1 are consecutive, the only common divisor is 1. Therefore, (b - 1) must be a product of divisors of k and k-1, but since those are coprime, (b - 1) must be the product of two coprime factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k - 1.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating that. Let's think differently.

We have k(k - 1) ≡ 0 mod (b - 1). So, for each b, (b - 1) must divide k(k - 1). So, for a given b, any k where k ≡ 0 or 1 mod (b - 1) would satisfy the condition because if (b -1) divides k or k -1, then the product would be divisible by (b -1).

So, for each b, the possible k's would be those that are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo (b -1). But wait, that's not necessarily all possible k's, because (b -1) could have multiple factors, and k could be any multiple of those factors. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that for each b, the possible k's are those where k ≡ 0 mod d or k ≡ 1 mod d, where d is a divisor of (b -1). But perhaps that's complicating it.

Alternatively, since k and k-1 are consecutive, (b -1) must divide the product k(k -1). So, the prime factors of (b -1) must be distributed between k and k -1. Since k and k-1 are coprime, each prime factor of (b -1) must divide either k or k -1, but not both.

Therefore, (b -1) can be written as a product of two coprime numbers, say m and n, such that m divides k and n divides k -1.

So, (b -1) = m * n, where m and n are coprime.

Then, k ≡ 0 mod m, and k ≡ 1 mod n.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since m and n are coprime, there's a unique solution modulo m*n, which is exactly (b -1). So, for each such pair (m, n), we can find a solution k.

But wait, this might not directly help in counting the number of k's for a given b. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me try another angle. For a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers n is the number of k's such that:

1. k^2 = a*b + c
2. a + c = k
3. 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

From earlier, we have:

a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1)

Since a must be an integer, (b -1) must divide (k^2 -k). So, (
