Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid, and I need to figure out how many ways there are to do this under certain conditions. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the setup: there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for color. I need to place some of these chips in the 25 cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. Now, the conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Also, the placement should be such that if I try to add any more chips, it would violate one of these two conditions. 

Hmm, okay. So each row has to be all white or all black, and each column also has to be all white or all black. That sounds like the grid has to be a checkerboard pattern, or maybe some kind of block pattern where each row and column is uniformly colored. But wait, no, because each row and column can independently be white or black. So it's more like every row is either all white or all black, and every column is either all white or all black. But they have to be consistent in some way.

Wait, but if every row is all white or all black, and every column is all white or all black, then the intersection of a row and a column would have to be either white or black, but both the row and column's color. So for each cell (i,j), if row i is color A and column j is color B, then the cell must be both A and B. So A must equal B, otherwise, the cell can't have a chip because it's both A and B, which would be conflicting. Therefore, the color of each row must match the color of each column in that cell.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way to think about it. Let me try to visualize this.

Suppose row 1 is white. Then every cell in row 1 must be white. Now, if column 1 is black, then every cell in column 1 must be black. But the cell at (1,1) is in both row 1 (white) and column 1 (black),
