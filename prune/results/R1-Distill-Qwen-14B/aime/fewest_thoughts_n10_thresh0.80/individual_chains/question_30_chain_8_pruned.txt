Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, so ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's not 1. That probably means it has some nice properties that I can use.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some cyclic properties. For example, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k from 0 to 12 gives all the distinct 13th roots. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, Φ₁₃(x) is actually x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1 because 13 is prime. So, that might come into play later.

The problem is asking about the product P = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That looks a bit complex. I'm thinking maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to some known polynomials. Let me see.

Let me denote each term in the product as (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Maybe I can rewrite this expression in a more manageable form. Let's factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the whole expression as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. That looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me write it as (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, maybe I can factor this quadratic or relate it to some known equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at certain points
