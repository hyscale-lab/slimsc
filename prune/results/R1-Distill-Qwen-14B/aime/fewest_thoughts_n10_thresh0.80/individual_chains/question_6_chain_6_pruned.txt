Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I should probably understand what functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. These are absolute value functions, which usually create V-shaped graphs, but with these nested absolute values, they might have more complexity.

Let me start by graphing f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2: so that's shifting the graph down by 1/2. But since we take the absolute value again, any negative parts will be flipped above the x-axis. 

So, when |x| >= 1/2, ||x| - 1/2| is just |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape starting at x=1/2, y=0, going up. But for |x| < 1/2, ||x| - 1/2| becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|, which is an upside-down V between x=-1/2 and x=1/2. So the graph of f(x) is a W-shape, with vertices at x= -1/2, 0, 1/2, each at y=0, and peaks at x=0, y=1/2. Wait, no: actually, when |x| is less than 1/2, it's 1/2 - |x|, which peaks at x=0, y=1/2, and then decreases to 0 at x=1/2 and x=-1/2. Then, for |x| beyond 1/2, it's |x| - 1/2, which increases linearly. So the graph of f(x) is a "W" but only the middle part is a V, and the sides are Vs as well. Hmm, maybe more accurately, it's two Vs: one from x=-infty to -1/2, then a V from -1/2 to 1/2, and then another V from 1/2 to infty.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's do the same analysis. The inner |x| is a V. Subtracting 1/4 gives |x| - 1/4, which for |x| >= 1/4 is just that, and for |x| < 1/4, it's 1/4 - |x|. Taking the absolute value again: but wait, since |x| - 1/4 is already positive when |x| >=1/4, so ||x| -1/4| is the same as |x| - 1/4 in that region. But for |x| < 1/4, |x| -1/4 is negative, so the absolute value makes it 1/4 - |x|. So the graph of g(x) is a V-shape with vertex at x=0, y=0, but with a flat bottom between x=-1/4 and x=1/4. Wait, no: when |x| <1/4, g(x) is 1/4 - |x|, which is a peak at x=0, y=1/4, and then decreases to 0 at x=1/4 and x=-1/4. For |x| beyond 1/4, it's |x| -1/4, so the graph is a V-shape starting from (1/4, 0) going upwards. So, the graph of g(x) is a "W" as well, but with a central peak at (0,1/4), and Vs on either side.

Alright, so now f and g are both piecewise linear functions with multiple segments. Now, the functions we have are 4g(f(...)), so scaling these functions by 4.

Let me think about y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). So this is a composition of functions: first sin(2πx), then f applied to that, then g applied to the result, and then multiplied by 4. Similarly, the other equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Since both equations involve compositions of f and g with sin and cos functions, which are periodic, the overall functions y and x will have some periodicity as well. So, perhaps I can find the periods of these functions and then analyze the intersections within a specific interval, then multiply by the number of periods.

Let me first find the periods of the inner functions.

For y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))): the inner function is sin(2πx). The period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so here it's 2π/(2π) = 1. So sin(2πx) has period 1. Then, f and g are applied, but since they are absolute value functions, they are even functions, so their composition with sin(2πx) might affect the period? Or maybe not, because f and g are even, and sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. Let me think.

Wait, because f and g are even functions, meaning f(-x) = f(x), so applying f to sin(2πx) is same as applying f to |sin(2πx)|? No, because sin(2πx) can be negative. But f takes the absolute value first. Wait, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, so f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2|.

So, regardless of whether sin(2πx) is positive or negative, it's taken the absolute value first, then subtract 1/2, then absolute again. So, f(sin(2πx)) is equal to || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

So, which is the same as | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. Because the outer absolute is redundant if the inner is already an absolute value. Wait, no: let's see, let me compute:

Let me denote z = |sin(2πx)|.
