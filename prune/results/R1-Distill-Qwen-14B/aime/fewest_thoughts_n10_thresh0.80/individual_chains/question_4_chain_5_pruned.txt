Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, let's think about the game. It's a turn-based game with two possible moves each turn. Since the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens, the game outcome depends on the number of tokens left and whose turn it is.

I remember that in such games, we can model the positions as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, positions can be either P-positions (previous player can force a win, i.e., the current player is losing) or N-positions (next player can force a win, i.e., the current player is winning). Wait, actually, I've heard it called "winning" and "losing" positions, where a winning position is when the current player can win no matter what.

Let me try to define:

- If a player is faced with n tokens, they can take 1 or 4. If from n, all possible moves lead to a winning position for the opponent, then n is a losing position. Otherwise, it's a winning position.

Since the last token wins, if n=0, the player who just moved has won, so n=0 is a losing position for the current player. But wait, n=0 can't be a starting position, but if you take the last token, you win. So maybe the base case is n=0 is losing for the current player, as they can't move.

So, starting from n=0:

n=0: losing (can't move, so previous player wins)
n=1: current player can take 1 and win. So winning.
n=2: take 1, leaving 1 for opponent, who can then take 1 and win. Wait, no, wait. Let me think carefully.

Wait, n=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take 1 and win. So that's bad. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because n=2, can't take 4. So n=2 would be a losing position because the only move is to leave n=1 for opponent, who can then win. So n=2 is losing.

Wait, but wait: when n=1, the current player can take 1 and win. So if n=2 is losing, because the only move is to n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent.

Similarly, n=3: the current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So n=3 would be a winning position.

n=4: current player can take 4 and win. So n=
