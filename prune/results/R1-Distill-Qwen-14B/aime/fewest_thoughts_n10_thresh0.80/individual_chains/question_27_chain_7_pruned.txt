Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by revolving a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So the distance from the center of the original circle to the axis is 6. Got it.

The sphere has a radius of 11. Now, when the torus rests inside the sphere, they are internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's outside, they are externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so let me think about the geometry here. The torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution) and the minor radius r (the radius of the generating circle). In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

Wait, actually, the standard notation might have R as the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus. So in this problem, the generating circle has radius 3, and the center of that circle is 6 units from the axis. So the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.

So, the torus is defined by R = 6 and r = 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. The sphere has radius 11, so its center is somewhere in space. The torus must be positioned such that it is tangent to the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent externally.

Wait, maybe I should model the centers. Let me assume both the torus and the sphere are centered at the same point for simplicity. Since the sphere is of radius 11, and the torus is a surface, its "center" is the center of the generating circle's path during revolution. So if the torus is centered at the same point as the sphere, then when it's inside, the closest point on the torus to the center is R - r = 6 - 3 = 3 units away, and the farthest is R + r = 9 units away. But the sphere has radius 11, so when the torus is inside, the sphere's radius is larger than the torus's farthest point. But how does tangency come into play?

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Tangency along a circle implies that the point of contact is a circle. So, for internal tangency, the torus must be such that the sphere touches it along a circle. Similarly, for external.

Perhaps I should think in terms of the centers. Let me think about the torus as a surface. Any point on the torus can be described in cylindrical coordinates. The distance from the center of the torus to any point on the surface can vary, but the sphere is fixed with radius 11.

Wait, let me consider the cross-section. If I take a cross-section through the axis of the torus, I'd see a circle of radius r (3) rotating around the axis at a distance R (6). So in cross-section, the torus looks like two circles connected by lines, but actually, it's a surface of revolution.

Hmm, maybe I can model the distance from the center of the sphere to a point on the torus. Let me consider a point on the torus. In cylindrical coordinates, a point (ρ, φ, z) on the torus satisfies ρ = R ± r cos φ, where R is 6 and r is 3. So ρ = 6 ± 3 cos φ.

The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11. So the distance from the origin to any point on the torus must be equal to
