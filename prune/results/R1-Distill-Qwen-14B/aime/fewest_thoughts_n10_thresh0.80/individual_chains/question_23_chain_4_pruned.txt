Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have a hyperbola given by the equation (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the supremum of BD², but it's phrased as the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi, which is essentially the same as the infimum of BD²'s upper bounds. Hmm, maybe I got that mixed up, but I think it's the maximum value that BD² can approach but not exceed.

First, let me recall some properties. A rhombus has all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, actually, I think I'm confusing with a square. Let me check: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles, and they are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola as well.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the points A, B, C, D are such that for each pair of opposite points, their coordinates are negatives of each other. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be (u, v) and (-u, -v), respectively.

But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, if diagonal AC has a slope m, then diagonal BD should have a
