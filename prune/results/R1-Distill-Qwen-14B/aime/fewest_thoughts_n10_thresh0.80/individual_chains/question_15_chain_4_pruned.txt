Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid, you'd need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 moves. The twist here is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, that part is a bit tricky. I need to figure out how to model this.

First, let me make sure I understand what it means to change direction exactly four times. In a grid path, each step is either right or up. So, a direction change happens when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. For example, if you start moving right for a few steps, then switch to up, that's one direction change. Each time you switch, it counts as a change.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that affect the number of segments in each direction? Let's see. Each time you change direction, you're starting a new segment. So, starting direction is right or up? Wait, the starting corner is the lower left, so the first move is either right or up. Hmm, but to get from (0,0) to (8,8), you have to make exactly 8 right and 8 up moves, but the order can vary.

Wait, maybe a better way to think about it is to model the path as a sequence of runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. So, each time you switch direction, you start a new run. If the path changes direction exactly four times, that means the number of runs is five. Because each direction change adds a new run. So, for four changes, you have five runs.

Wait, let me check that. Suppose you start moving right, then up, then right, then up, then right. That's four direction changes, right? So starting with right, then up (change 1), then right (change 2), up (change 3), right (change 4). So that's four changes, and five runs. Yes, that makes sense.

So, each path that changes direction exactly four times will consist of five runs. Each run is either all right moves or all up moves. Now, each
