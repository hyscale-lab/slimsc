Alright, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Jen is participating in a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). Here, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize (which includes winning the grand prize). So, essentially, we need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has won at least two numbers.

Wait, but actually, winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize because if she wins the grand prize, she automatically has all four numbers matching, which is more than two. So, the formula applies here.

First, let me define the problem more concretely. The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is C(10,4), where C(n,k) is the combination formula.

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, the total number of possible combinations is 210.

Now, let's think about the events:

- Event A: Jen wins the grand prize. This happens only when her 4 numbers are exactly the same as the 4 drawn. So, there's only 1 way this can happen. Therefore, P(A) = 1/210.

- Event B: Jen wins a prize, which means she has at least two numbers matching. So, this includes the cases where she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching the drawn numbers.

We need to compute P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since A is a subset of B (if she wins the grand prize, she definitely wins a prize), P(A and B) is just P(A). Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, first, I need to calculate P(B), the probability of winning a prize (at least two numbers matching). To find P(B), it's easier to calculate 1 - P(not B), where P(not B) is the probability of having fewer than two numbers matching, i.e., exactly 0 or exactly 1 number matching.

Let me compute P(not B) first.

Case 1: Exactly 0 numbers matching. So, Jen's 4 numbers are completely different from the 4 drawn. How many ways can this happen?

The total number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is C(10,4)=210. The number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers that don't include any of Jen's 4 numbers is C(6,4), because there are 6 numbers Jen didn't choose. C(6,4) = 15.

Wait, no. Wait, hold on. If Jen has chosen 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 6. So, the number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers that don't include any of Jen's is C(6,4) = 15. So, the number of favorable outcomes for this case is 15.

Case 2: Exactly 1 number matching. So, the lottery picks 4 numbers, exactly one of which is in Jen's 4 numbers. How many ways does this happen?

To compute this, we need to choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 numbers from the 6 that she didn't choose. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3).

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the total number of ways for exactly 1 match is 80.

Therefore, the total number of ways for not winning a prize (i.e., 0 or 1 matches) is 15 + 80 = 95.

Hence, the number of favorable outcomes for event B (winning a prize) is total possible combinations minus the ones that don't give a prize. So, 210 - 95 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 รท 5 =23, 210 รท5=42. So, 23/42.

Wait, 23 is a prime number, so we can't reduce it further. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that calculation. 15 (for 0 matches) +80 (for 1 match) =95. 210-95=1
