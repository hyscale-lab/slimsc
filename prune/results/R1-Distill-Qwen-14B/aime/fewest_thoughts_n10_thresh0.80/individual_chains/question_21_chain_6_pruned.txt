Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, okay, let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). So that makes sense.

So, to break it down, for a number n to be b-eautiful, it needs to satisfy two things:
- n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b^1 (which is b) and b^2 - 1. Because in base b, two-digit numbers go from 10_b (which is b in decimal) up to (b-1)(b-1)_b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.
- The sum of the two digits in base b equals sqrt(n). So if n is written as d1 d0 in base b, then d1 + d0 = sqrt(n).

So, mathematically, if n is written as d1*b + d0 in base 10, then d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0). Also, d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so they must satisfy 0 <= d0 <= b-1 and 1 <= d1 <= b-1 (since it's a two-digit number, the first digit can't be zero).

So, our goal is to find the smallest b >= 2 such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Alright, so perhaps I can model this problem mathematically. Let me denote d1 and d0 as the digits, so n = d1*b + d0. The condition is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n), which is sqrt(d1*b + d0). Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.

So, expanding the left side: d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0.

Let me rearrange this equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. Maybe I can rearrange terms differently. Let me group terms involving d1 and d0:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in d1. So, for each base b and each possible d0, we can solve for d1. But d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so they must satisfy 1 <= d1 <= b-1 and 0 <= d0 <= b-1.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this equation as:

n = (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.

So, n is a perfect square because it's equal to (d1 + d0)^2. So, n must be a perfect square.

Therefore, for each base b, the b-eautiful numbers are two-digit numbers in base b which are perfect squares, and whose digits sum to their square roots.

So, the approach could be: for each base b, check all two-digit numbers in base b (which are integers from b to b^2 - 1 in decimal), and count how many of them are perfect squares and satisfy the sum of digits condition. Then, find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

But since we are to find the smallest b with more than ten such numbers, perhaps it's better to find for each b, how many two-digit numbers in base b are perfect squares with digit sums equal to their square roots.

But this might be computationally intensive if done manually for each b. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about how the numbers n can be represented. For each base b, n can be written as d1*b + d0, where d1 is from 1 to b-1, d0 from 0 to b-1. Also, n must be a perfect square, say k^2, where k = d1 + d0. So, n = k^2, and k = d1 + d0.

So, substituting, n = (d1 + d0)^2, and n = d1*b + d0.

So, (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.

So, now, for each b, we can look for integers d1, d0, k such that:

k^2 = d1*b + d0,

k = d1 + d0,

with 1 <= d1 <= b-1,

0 <= d0 <= b-1.

So, substituting k into the first equation:

k^2 = d1*b + (k - d1),

since d0 = k - d1.

So, rearrange:

k^2 = d1*b + k - d1.

Bring all terms to one side:

k^2 - k = d1*(b - 1).

So, d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).

But d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive. So, for each b, and each k, we can compute d1 as (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).

But also, d0 = k - d1, which must be between 0 and b-1.

Let me see. So, for a given b, k must satisfy that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), so that d1 is an integer.

Additionally, d1 must be in [1, b-1], and d0 = k - d1 must be in [0, b-1].

So, perhaps for each b, we can find all k such that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b-1), and d1 and d0 are valid digits.

So, for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers equals the number of k such that:

1. k^2 - k is divisible by (b - 1),
2. d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) is between 1 and b-1,
3. d0 = k - d1 is between 0 and b-1.

Furthermore, since n = k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which implies that n is between b and b^2 -1. So, k^2 >= b and k^2 <= b^2 -1. Therefore, k must satisfy sqrt(b) <= k <= sqrt(b^2 -1). Since sqrt(b^2 - 1) is just slightly less than b, k can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.

Wait, but when b is 2, the two-digit numbers go up to 3 (11_2 is 3). So, k can't be more than or equal to b, because then k^2 would be at least b^2, which is outside the two-digit numbers.

Wait, n = k^2, and n must be less than b^2, so k must be less than b.

So, k must be in the range 1 <= k < b, because k^2 must be less than b^2.

Wait, but in the example, 81 is 13-eautiful. 81 is 9^2, so k=9, which is less than 13. So that's correct.

But in that case, the possible values for k are 1, 2, ..., up to floor(b-1), since k must be less than b.

But wait, also, n must be at least b, so k^2 >= b. So, k >= sqrt(b). So, k can range from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.

So, for each b, k can take integer values from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1.

Now, for each such k, we can compute d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b -1). If this is an integer, and d1 is within [1, b-1], and d0 = k - d1 is within [0, b-1], then n = k^2 is a b-eautiful number.

So, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and d1 and d0 are valid digits.

So, the problem reduces to, for each b >=2, count the number of such k, and find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10.

So, perhaps I can model this as a function f(b) which counts the number of valid k for base b, and then find the smallest b where f(b) >10.

To compute f(b), for each b, we can iterate k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, check if (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), compute d1 and d0, and check if they are valid digits.

But since this is a thought process, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for f(b). Alternatively, perhaps I can find for each b, the number of k such that (
