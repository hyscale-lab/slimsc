Okay, so Jen is entering this lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Here, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. But since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two numbers matching, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the probability we're looking for is P(A)/P(B).

So first, let's figure out P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Then, we'll find P(B), the probability of winning a prize, and then take the ratio.

Let's start with P(A). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). There's only one way for her to pick the exact 4 numbers that are drawn. So, the probability P(A) is 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, moving on to P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which happens when at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, she could have exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching. Since we already know that 4 matching is the grand prize, which is included here.

So, P(B) is the probability that she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches. Alternatively, we can compute 1 minus the probability of having fewer than 2 matches, which is 1 - [probability of 0 matches + probability of 1 match]. That might be easier.

But let me think both ways.

First way: Compute the number of favorable outcomes for exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches.

For exactly 4 matches: That's the same as P(A), which is 1 case.

For exactly 3 matches: She has 3 of her 4 numbers matching, and 1 not matching. The number of ways is C(4,3) * C(6,1). Because she chooses 3 from her 4, and the remaining 1 number from the 6 numbers she didn't pick.

Similarly, for exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because she chooses 2 from her 4, and the remaining 2 from the 6 she didn't pick.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize (at least 2 matches) is:

C(4,4)*C(6,0) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,2)*C(6,2).

Calculating each term:

C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Adding them up: 1 + 24 + 90 = 115.

So, total favorable outcomes for B are 115. The total possible outcomes are C(10,4) = 210. So, P(B) = 115/210.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, using the complementary approach: 1 - probability of 0 or 1 matches.

Compute P(0 matches): All four numbers drawn are from the 6 numbers Jen didn't choose. So, C(6,4). The number of such combinations is C(6,4) = 15.

Similarly, P(1 match): C(4,1)*C(6,3). That is, choose 1 from Jen's numbers and 3 from the others. C(4,1) = 4, C(6,3) = 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

So total non-winning cases: 15 (for 0 matches) + 80 (for 1 match) = 95. So, the number of winning cases is total minus non-winning: 210 - 95 = 115. So, same as before. Therefore, P(B) = 115/210.

Simplify that: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, wait, 23/42? Let me check the calculation
