Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (xy).

Similarly, let's go back to equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z from equation (z), so let's substitute that.

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Compute 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's note this as equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy), x y = 2^(-2/3). But from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12). So substituting y into (xy):

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which simplifies to:

x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12):

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12) => x = 2^(-7/24), since x is positive.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that exponent.

Wait, 2^(-2/3) is 2^(-8/12). Then 2^(1/12) is 2^(1/12). So when you multiply, exponents add: (-8/12 + 1/12) = (-7/12). So x^2 = 2^(-7/12).

Therefore, x = sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24).

So x = 2^(-7/24). Let me write that as equation (x).

Now, from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12). So plug in x:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y = 2^(-3/8). Equation (y).

And we already had z = 2^(-5/12). Equation (z).

Now, let me write down all three variables:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-3/8)
z = 2^(-5/12)

To make it easier, let's express all exponents with a common denominator. The denominators are 24, 8, 12. The least common multiple is 24.

So:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-9/24) since -3/8 = -9/24
z = 2^(-10/24) since -5/12 = -10/24

So x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24).

Hmm, maybe I can write them as:

x = 2^{-7/24}, y = 2^{-9/24}, z = 2^{-10/24}

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let me compute the exponent first: x^4 y^3 z^2.

Since each variable is a power of 2, I can write x^4 as (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-28/24} = 2^{-7/6}

Similarly, y^3 = (2^{-9/24})^3 = 2^{-27/24} = 2^{-9/8}

z^2 = (2^{-10/24})^2 = 2^{-20/24} = 2^{-5/6}

So x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} * 2^{-9/8} * 2^{-5/6}

Since multiplying same base exponents, add them:

Exponent = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Let me compute that. First, let's find a common denominator. 6, 8, 6. The LCM is 24.

Convert each:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding these together:

-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify -75/24. Both are divisible by 3: 75 ÷ 3=25, 24 ÷3=8. So -25/8.

So x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-25/8}

Now, log₂ of that is log₂(2^{-25/8}) = -25/8.

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25 and n=8. They are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, no common factors.

Thus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with the exponents:

x = 2^{-7/24}, so x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7*4/24} = 2^{-28/24} = 2^{-7/6} ✔️

y = 2^{-9/24} = 2^{-3/8}, so y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8} ✔️

z = 2^{-10/24} = 2^{-5/12}, so z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-10/12} = 2^{-5/6} ✔️

So x^4 y^3 z^2 is 2^{-7/6} * 2^{-9/8} * 2^{-5/6} = 2^{ (-7/6 -9/8 -5/6) }

Compute exponents:

-7/6 -5/6 = (-12/6) = -2. Then -2 -9/8.

Convert -2 to eighths: -2 = -16/8. So -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8. So exponent is -25/8. So x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-25/8} ✔️

log₂ of that is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So yes, 25/8 is correct.

Thus, m=25, n=8, m +n=33.


To solve the problem, we start by converting each logarithmic equation to its exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

Substituting these into each other, we derive expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of powers of 2:

- \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)
- \(y = 2^{-3/8}\)
- \(z = 2^{-5/12}\)

Next, we compute \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

- \(x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}\)
- \(y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}\)
- \(z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}\)

Combining these, we get:
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

The absolute value is \(\left|-\frac{25}{8}\right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
