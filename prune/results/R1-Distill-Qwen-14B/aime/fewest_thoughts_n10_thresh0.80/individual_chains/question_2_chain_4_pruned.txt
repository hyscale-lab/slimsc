Okay, so I have this problem with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then there's this family F of segments PQ, each of length 1, in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, other than A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. I need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

First, I should probably sketch the situation to visualize it. O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere in the first quadrant on the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So AB is a line connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). That line should have a negative slope.

Next, the family F consists of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So each segment PQ is a line connecting a point (p, 0) to (0, q), where sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So p^2 + q^2 = 1. That means that for any point P on the x-axis, the corresponding Q is determined by this equation.

Now, all these segments PQ form a family of lines in the first quadrant. Each such line has the equation x/p + y/q = 1, since it connects (p,0) and (0,q). But since p^2 + q^2 = 1, there's a relationship between p and q for each segment PQ.

The problem states that point C is on AB, not A or B, and is the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. So AB is one of these segments PQ, and we're looking for a point C on AB that's not on any other PQ in F.

Wait, AB is a segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), so let me confirm if AB actually has length 1. Let's compute the distance between A and B:

Distance AB = sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1.

Yes, AB is a unit segment, so AB is indeed in the family F. So AB is one of the segments PQ where P is (1/2, 0) and Q is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the line AB is part of the family F, and we need to find a point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB.

So, probably, if we consider all other such segments PQ (each of length 1), they form a sort of envelope around the region, and point C is the point where AB just touches this envelope. That is, C is the point where AB is tangent to some curve formed by the family F.

Wait, I remember that when you have a family of lines, their envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So in this case, the envelope of all the segments PQ in F should be a curve, and AB is one of those lines. So the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope curve, meaning that at C, AB just touches the envelope without crossing it, making C the only point on AB that's on another PQ. But no, wait, the problem says C doesn't belong to any other PQ except AB. So perhaps the envelope is such that only AB passes through C, and all other PQs don't pass through C.

Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Since all PQ segments are of length 1, lying in the first quadrant, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis, their endpoints satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1. So each PQ corresponds to a different p and q, but linked by p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So for each p in (0,1), q is sqrt(1 - p^2). So the family of lines is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p^2)) = 1, with p in (0,1).

Alternatively, we can parameterize p as cos(theta) and q as sin(theta), since p^2 + q^2 = 1. Then each line is x/(cos(theta)) + y/(sin(theta)) = 1, for theta in (0, pi/2).

So, for each theta, the line is x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1.

Now, the envelope of these lines can be found by solving for the curve that is tangent to each of these lines. The method to find the envelope involves taking the derivative of the family with respect to the parameter and solving the system of equations.

Let me recall: For a family of curves F(theta, x, y) = 0, the envelope satisfies F(theta, x, y) = 0 and dF/dtheta = 0.

So here, F(theta, x, y) = x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) - 1.

Compute dF/dtheta:

dF/dtheta = x * sec(theta) tan(theta) - y * csc(theta) cot(theta).

Set both F(theta, x, y) and dF/dtheta to zero.

So:

1. x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1.

2. x sec(theta) tan(theta) - y csc(theta) cot(theta) = 0.

We can write these equations as:

Equation 1: x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) = 1.

Equation 2: x sin(theta)/cos^2(theta) - y cos(theta)/sin^2(theta) = 0.

Let me express equation 2 as:

x sin(theta)/cos^2(theta) = y cos(theta)/sin^2(theta).

Multiply both sides by cos^2(theta) sin^2(theta):

x sin^3(theta) = y cos^3(theta).

So, y = x (sin^3(theta)/cos^3(theta)).

Let me denote t = tan(theta), so sin(theta) = t / sqrt(1 + t^2), cos(theta) = 1 / sqrt(1 + t^2).

So sin^3(theta)/cos^3(theta) = t^3. Therefore, y = x t^3.

So, y = x t^3.

Now, let's substitute this into equation 1:

x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) = 1.

Replace y with x t^3:

x / cos(theta) + (x t^3) / sin(theta) = 1.

Factor out x:

x [1 / cos(theta) + t^3 / sin(theta)] = 1.

But t = tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta). So t^3 = sin^3(theta)/cos^3(theta).

Let me express 1 / cos(theta) as sec(theta) and t^3 / sin(theta) as [sin^3(theta)/cos^3(theta)] / sin(theta) = sin^2(theta)/cos^3(theta).

So:

x [sec(theta) + sin^2(theta)/cos^3(theta)] = 1.

But let's express everything in terms of t.

Since t = tan(theta), we have sin(theta) = t / sqrt(1 + t^2), cos(theta) = 1 / sqrt(1 + t^2).

So 1/cos(theta) = sqrt(1 + t^2).

Similarly, sin^2(theta) = t^2 / (1 + t^2), cos^3(theta) = 1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2).

So:

x [ sqrt(1 + t^2) + [t^2 / (1 + t^2)] / [1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2)] ) ] = 1.

Wait, let's compute sin^2(theta)/cos^3(theta):

= (t^2/(1 + t^2)) / (1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2)) )

= (t^2/(1 + t^2)) * (1 + t^2)^(3/2)/1 )

= t^2 (1 + t^2)^(1/2).

So:

Equation becomes:

x [ sqrt(1 + t^2) + t^2 sqrt(1 + t^2) ) ] = 1.

Factor sqrt(1 + t^2):

x sqrt(1 + t^2) [1 + t^2] = 1.

Wait, wait:

Wait, sqrt(1 + t^2) + t^2 sqrt(1 + t^2) = sqrt(1 + t^2)(1 + t^2) = (1 + t^2)^(3/2).

So we have:

x * (1 + t^2)^(3/2) = 1.

So x = 1 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2).

And since y = x t^3, we have y = t^3 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2).

So, the parametric equations for the envelope are:

x = 1 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2),

y = t^3 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2).

Alternatively, since t is tan(theta), but it's easier to work with t as a parameter.

Now, we can try to eliminate t to find a relation between x and y.

Let me square both equations to simplify.

From x: x^2 = 1 / (1 + t^2)^3.

From y: y^2 = t^6 / (1 + t^2)^3.

So, y^2 = t^6 * (1 + t^2)^3 * x^2.

Wait, since x^2 = 1/(1 + t^2)^3, then (1 + t^2)^3 = 1/x^2.

So y^2 = t^6 * (1/x^2).

But t^6 = (t^2)^3.

Also, from x^2 = 1/(1 + t^2)^3,

=> (1 + t^2)^3 = 1/x^2,

=> 1 + t^2 = (1/x^2)^(1/3) = x^(-2/3).

So t^2 = x^(-2/3) - 1.

So t^6 = (x^(-2/3) - 1)^3.

Thus,

y^2 = [ (x^(-2/3) - 1)^3 ] * (1/x^2).

Let me compute that:

y^2 = (x^(-2/3) - 1)^3 / x^2.

Hmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to express the envelope.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the parametric equations.

x = (1 + t^2)^(-3/2),

y = t^3 (1 + t^2)^(-3/2).

Let me set t = u, so:

x = (1 + u^2)^(-3/2),

y = u^3 (1 + u^2)^(-3/2).

Let me see if I can express y in terms of x.

Let me denote s = u^2, so s >= 0.

Then,

x = (1 + s)^( -3/2),

y = u^3 (1 + s)^(-3/2) = u^3 x.

But u = sqrt(s), so y = s^(3/2) x.

So, y = s^(3/2) x.

But from x = (1 + s)^(-3/2), we can write (1 + s) = (1/x)^(2/3).

So, 1 + s = (1/x)^(2/3), which implies s = (1/x)^(2/3) - 1.

Substituting back into y:

y = [ ( (1/x)^(2/3) - 1 ) ]^(3/2) * x.

Let me compute this:

y = [ ( (1/x)^(2/3) - 1 ) ]^(3/2) * x.

Let me write (1/x)^(2/3) as x^(-2/3).

So,

y = [ x^(-2/3) - 1 ]^(3/2) * x.

Let me factor [x^(-2/3) - 1] as -(1 - x^(-2/3)).

So,

y = [ - (1 - x^(-2/3)) ]^(3/2) * x.

But (negative)^(3/2) is not real, so perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, maybe I should instead think about expressing y in terms of x without substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express in terms of a different variable.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the parametric equations in terms of t and try to find a relation between x and y.

Wait, another approach: Let me note that the given point C lies on AB, so I can parametrize AB
