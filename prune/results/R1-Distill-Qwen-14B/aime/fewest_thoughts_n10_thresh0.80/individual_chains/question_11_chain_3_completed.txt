Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number z with |z| = 4 can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I could write z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). But maybe working with exponentials would be easier here since we'll be dealing with powers of z.

Wait, but in the expression, there's a z and 1/z. Since |z| = 4, |1/z| would be 1/4. So 1/z is just (1/4)e^{-iθ} because if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So let me write z as 4e^{iθ} and 1/z as (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Then, substituting these into the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately. First, compute (75 + 117i)*4:

75 * 4 = 300, and 117 * 4 = 468. So that term becomes 300 + 468i.

Similarly, (96 + 144i)/4 is 24 + 36i.

So now, the expression is:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, I need to find the real part of this expression. So let's compute each term's real part and then add them together.

Let me recall that the real part of a complex number a + ib is Re(a + ib) = a. But when we multiply by e^{iθ}, which is cosθ + i sinθ, we can use the distributive property.

Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. Then the expression becomes A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

The real part of this is Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}) = Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}).

Now, Re(A e^{iθ}) is the real part of A multiplied by e^{iθ}, which is Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ. Wait, no, actually, it's Re(A e^{iθ}) = Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ? Wait, maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, the product of two complex numbers a + ib and c + id is (ac - bd) + i(ad + bc). So if I have A e^{iθ} where A = a + ib and e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, then their product is (a cosθ - b sinθ) + i(a sinθ + b cosθ). So the real part is a cosθ - b sinθ, and the imaginary part is a sinθ + b cosθ.

So, Re(A e^{iθ}) = a cosθ - b sinθ, where a is the real part of A and b is the imaginary part of A.

Similarly, Re(B e^{-iθ}) would be Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ, because e^{-iθ} is cosθ - i sinθ.

Wait, let me check that. So B = c + id, then B e^{-iθ} = (c + id)(cosθ - i sinθ) = c cosθ + d sinθ + i(-c sinθ + d cosθ). So the real part is c cosθ + d sinθ, which is Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ.

So putting it all together, the real part of the entire expression is:

[Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ] + [Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ]

Which simplifies to:

(Re(A) + Re(B)) cosθ + (-Im(A) + Im(B)) sinθ.

Now, let's plug in the values:

Re(A) = 300, Re(B) = 24. So Re(A) + Re(B) = 324.

Im(A) = 468, Im(B) = 36. So -Im(A) + Im(B) = -468 +36 = -432.

So the real part of the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, the problem is to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, this looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine. I remember there's a formula for the maximum of such expressions. The maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is sqrt(a² + b²). Wait, but in this case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So the maximum value of this expression is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324² + 432²).

Wait, but let me verify that. The maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is indeed sqrt(a² + b²), right? Because you can write it as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²). So the maximum value is R, and the minimum is -R.

So in this case, a = 324, b = -432.

So R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2:

324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So total is 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 976. Wait, wait, 300 +24=324, so (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So 324^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 +24²= 90000 + 14400 +576 = 90000+14400=104400 +576=104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160000, 32^2=1024, 2*400*32=25600. So 160000 +25600=185600 +1024=186,624.

So sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600).

What is sqrt(291600)? Let's see, 500² is 250,000, 540²=291,600. Because 500²=250k, 540²= (500+40)^2=500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250000 +40000 +1600=291,600. So sqrt(291600)=540.

So the maximum value of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ is 540.

Wait, so the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes when I'm dealing with signs, I might have missed something.

The expression was Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}) = [Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ] + [Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ].

So that combines to (Re(A) + Re(B)) cosθ + ( -Im(A) + Im(B)) sinθ.

Plugging the numbers, Re(A)=300, Re(B)=24, so 324 cosθ.

Im(A)=468, Im(B)=36, so -468 +36= -432. So -432 sinθ.

So yes, 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So the maximum is sqrt(324² +432²)=540.

So the largest possible real part is 540. That seems correct.

But wait, just to make sure, let me think about the initial substitution.

We substituted z = 4 e^{iθ}, which is correct because |z|=4. Then, 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}, which is correct.

Then, (75+117i) z = (75+117i)*4 e^{iθ}= (300 +468i) e^{iθ}.

Similarly, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}= (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

So that's correct.

Then, the real parts:

Re[(300 +468i) e^{iθ}] = 300 cosθ -468 sinθ,

Re[(24 +36i) e^{-iθ}] =24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

So sum is 300 +24=324 cosθ; -468 +36= -432 sinθ. So 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So yes, correct.

Then, maximum of this is sqrt(324² +432²) =540. So the answer is 540.

I think that makes sense. So I can confidently say the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\). Consequently, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting these into the expression:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i)\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Simplifying each term:
\[
(75 + 117i)4 = 300 + 468i, \quad (96 + 144i)\frac{1}{4} = 24 + 36i.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Taking the real part of each term:
\[
\text{Re}((300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}) = 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta,
\]
\[
\text{Re}((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}) = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.
\]
Adding these together:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]
The maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]
Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
