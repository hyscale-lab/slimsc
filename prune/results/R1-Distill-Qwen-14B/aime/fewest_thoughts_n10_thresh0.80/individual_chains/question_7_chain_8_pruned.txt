Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability, meaning each has a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. That means some colorings might be equivalent under rotation. But in this case, each vertex is colored independently, so we don't have to worry about symmetries in the coloring process itself, just the symmetries of the octagon.

The goal is to find the probability that there exists a rotation (by some number of steps) such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, if I imagine rotating the octagon, the blue vertices should align with the red ones. That implies that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but each vertex is independently colored, so the colorings are random. So, the question is essentially asking: What's the probability that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices? Because if it is, then rotating the octagon appropriately would align the blue and red vertices.

But since the octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8 (since it's an octagon), there are 8 possible rotations. So, for each coloring, we check if there's a rotation that transforms the blue set to the red set. If so, then that coloring counts towards our probability.

Alternatively, perhaps more precise: For a given coloring, let R be the set of red vertices and B be the set of blue vertices. Since all vertices are colored either red or blue, R and B are complements of each other. So, the condition is that B is a rotation of R. Since R and B are complements, this would mean that R is a rotation of B as well.

So, the problem reduces to finding colorings where the set of red vertices is a rotation of the set of blue vertices. Since R and B are complements, this is equivalent to saying that R is a rotation of its own complement. Or, in other words, that the set R is a fixed set under some rotation, up to complementation.

Wait, maybe another angle: The octagon has 8 vertices. Each coloring is a subset of these 8 vertices colored red, and the rest blue. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. Each coloring is equally likely with probability 1/256.

We need to count how many colorings satisfy the condition that there exists a rotation (including the identity rotation) such that when we apply that rotation, all blue vertices move to red positions. Since blue and red are complements, this is equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets S of the octagon's vertices such that S is a rotation of its complement. Because if S is a rotation of its complement, then rotating by that amount would move S (the blue vertices) to the complement of
