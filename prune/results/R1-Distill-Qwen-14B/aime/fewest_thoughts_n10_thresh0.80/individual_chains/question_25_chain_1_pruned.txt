Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to wrap my head around it. There are 900 residents in total. Each one owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given for everyone. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, others own a garden spade, and everyone has the candy hearts.

The numbers given are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and all 900 own candy hearts. Now, some residents own exactly two of these items, and some own exactly three. Specifically, 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four items.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps in counting the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering all possible intersections. But in this case, we're given some specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three items, so maybe I can model this using a Venn diagram approach with four sets.

Wait, but usually, a Venn diagram with four sets can get pretty complicated. Maybe I should approach it step by step. Let me denote the sets:

Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.

G be the set of people who own golf clubs.

S be the set of people who own a garden spade.

C be the set of people who own candy hearts. Since everyone owns C, it's like the universal set.

So, all residents are in C, and the others are subsets of C.

We need to find the number of people who are in all four sets, which is D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C. But since C is everyone, this is just D ∩ G ∩ S.

Wait, but how do the numbers given tie into this?

We have the sizes of each of the three sets: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, and |C| =
