Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, so Alice picks a set A, and Bob creates a list of all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me think about what Bob is doing. For each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum element. So, for each a in A, the number of such sets B is equal to the number of subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a-1}, each combined with the element a to form B.

Wait, that makes sense because for each a, the other elements in B can be any combination of the positive integers less than a. So, the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1}, since each element less than a can be either included or excluded.

But Bob is listing all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum is in A. So, for each a in A, the number of possible sets B with max element a is 2^{a-1}. Then, since A is a set of positive integers, the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a - 1}.

Wait, but wait a second, is that correct? Because if A has multiple elements, then for each a in A, you have 2^{a-1} sets where a is the maximum. So, the total number of sets B is the sum for all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

The problem states that Bob's list has 2024 sets. So, that sum must equal 2024.

Mathematically, that would be:

Σ (2^{a - 1}) for all a in A = 2024.

So, we have that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of the elements of A, given that this sum is 2024.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024, and then finding the sum of the elements in A.

Let me denote S = sum_{a in A} 2^{a -1} = 2024.

We need to find A such that S=2024 and then compute sum(A).

Hmm, so I need to find all possible subsets A where the sum of 2^{a-1} is 2024.

Wait, but how can A be a set? So, A is a set of positive integers, so all elements are distinct. So, each a is unique.

So, S = sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

It's a binary representation problem, perhaps.

Wait, think of 2024 in binary. Let me calculate that.

2024 in decimal is equal to:

Let's divide by 2:

2024 ÷ 2 = 1012, remainder 0

1012 ÷ 2 = 506, remainder 0

506 ÷ 2 = 253, remainder 0

253 ÷ 2 = 126, remainder 1

126 ÷ 2 = 63, remainder 0

63 ÷ 2 = 31, remainder 1

31 ÷ 2 = 15, remainder 1

15 ÷ 2 = 7, remainder 1

7 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 1

3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1

1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

So, writing the remainders from last to first:

1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0

Wait, let me count the bits:

Starting from the last division:

First division gives 1, then 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.

Wait, that's 12 bits.

Let me write it step by step:

2024 /2=1012 rem 0

1012 /2=506 rem 0

506 /2=253 rem 0

253 /2=126 rem 1

126 /2=63 rem 0

63 /2=31 rem 1

31 /2=15 rem 1

15 /2=7 rem 1

7 /2=3 rem 1

3 /2=1 rem 1

1 /2=0 rem 1

So, the remainders, from last to first: 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0.

Wait, 12 bits. Let's write them as bits from MSB to LSB:

2024 is 11111100100 in binary.

Wait, let's confirm.

Let me compute 1024 is 2^10 = 1024.

2024 - 1024 = 1000, so 1000 is left.

1000 is 512 + 256 + 128 + 64, which is 512+256=768, 768+128=896, 896+64=960. Wait, but 512+256+128+64= 960. 960 is less than 1000. 960 + 32=992, 992 + 8=1000. So, 1000 is 1111101000 in binary.

Wait, but 1000 is 2^3 * 125, but anyway.

But
