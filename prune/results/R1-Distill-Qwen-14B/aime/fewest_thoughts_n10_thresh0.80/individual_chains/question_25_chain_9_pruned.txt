Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. 

Alright, let's list out the given numbers. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns at least a bag of candy hearts. So, that means everyone has that one thing for sure. The other three—diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade—are optional. 

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.

Additionally, it's mentioned that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is about those who own all four. 

Wait, this sounds like a problem involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that in set theory, the inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by considering their individual sizes and the sizes of their intersections.

But let me think about how exactly to apply this here. Since each resident owns at least one thing (specifically, the candy hearts), the total number of residents is the same as the union of all four sets. So, the union of diamond ring owners, golf club owners, garden spade owners, and candy hearts owners is 900.

But wait, since everyone owns candy hearts, that means the union of the other three sets (diamond, golf, garden) plus those who only own candy hearts equals 900. Hmm, maybe I need to approach it differently.

Let me denote:
- D = set of diamond ring owners
- G = set of golf club owners
- S = set of garden spade owners
- C = set of candy hearts owners (which is everyone, so C has 900)

We’re looking for |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C is everyone, this is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

The problem gives the number of people owning exactly two items and exactly three items. So, maybe I can set up equations based on the inclusion-exclusion principle.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is a bit involved. Let's recall that:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since C is everyone, all intersections with C are the original sets. Wait, no, actually, since C is the entire population, any intersection with C is just the set itself. For example
