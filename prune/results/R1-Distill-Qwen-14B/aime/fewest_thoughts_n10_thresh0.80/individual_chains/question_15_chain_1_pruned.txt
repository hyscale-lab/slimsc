Okay, so I have this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, interesting.

Let me try to picture this. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So, moving from the lower left to the upper right would involve moving 7 steps up and 7 steps to the right, totaling 14 steps. Wait, but the problem says the paths are of length 16. That seems contradictory because in an 8x8 grid, the maximum number of steps you can take is 14 (7 right and 7 up). Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Oh wait, maybe the grid is 8x8 squares, which would actually be a 9x9 grid of points. Because for an 8x8 grid of squares, you have 9 points along each side. So, moving from the lower left to the upper right would require 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense with the path length of 16. So the grid is 8x8 squares, which is a 9x9 grid of points. Okay, that's cleared up.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, what does it mean to change direction? In grid paths, you can only move either right or up. So, a change in direction would be when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right.

For example, if you start moving right for a few steps, then switch to moving up for some steps, that's one change. Each time you switch, that's a direction change.

So, the total number of direction changes is four. That means the path will consist of five segments: starting with either right or up, then switching four times. So, the path alternates between moving right and up, but the number of times it changes direction is four, so the number of segments is five.

Wait, no, actually, it's a bit different. If you have four direction changes, that means the number of straight segments is five. Because each direction change marks the start of a new
