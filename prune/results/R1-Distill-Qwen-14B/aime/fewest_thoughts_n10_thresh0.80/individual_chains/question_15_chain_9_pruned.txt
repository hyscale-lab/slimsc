Okay, so I've got this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The catch here is that the path must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's an 8x8 grid, so it's like a chessboard with 8 rows and 8 columns. The start is at the lower left corner (0,0) and the end is at the upper right corner (8,8). Each path consists of moving either right or up, but in this problem, it's about changing direction. So, each time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change.

Wait, but the problem says the path changes direction exactly four times. That means the path alternates between right and up moves, and there are four such changes. So, how does that translate into the number of runs of right or up moves?

Let me think. Each time you change direction, you're starting a new "run." So, if you change direction four times, how many runs do you have? Well, each direction change increases the number of runs by one. Starting from the first run, each direction change adds another run. So, if you have four direction changes, you must have five runs in total. Because the first run doesn't count as a change, each subsequent change adds a run.

Wait, let me clarify: Starting at the beginning, you make a run in one direction, then change direction (that's one change) and start another run, and so on. So, the number of runs is one more than the number of direction changes. So, four direction changes mean five runs. So, the path is divided into five runs of consecutive right or up moves.

Now, these runs can be a combination of right and up runs. But since the path is from (0,0) to (8,8), it must have a total of 8 right moves and 8 up moves. Each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. So, with five runs, we need to partition the 8 right moves and 8 up moves into these runs.

But wait, since each direction change alternates between right and up, the runs alternate between right and up. So, the number of runs of right and up moves can differ by at most one. Because if you start with a right run, then you have right, up, right, up, etc., so with five runs, you'll have either three right runs and two up runs or three up runs and two right runs, depending on whether you start with right or up.

Wait, let's think about that. Five runs. If you start with right, the runs would be right, up, right, up, right. That's three right runs and two up runs. Alternatively, if you start with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up. Again, three up runs and two right runs.

So, the number of right runs and up runs can be either 3 and 2 or 2 and 3. So, for the problem at hand, the total number of runs is five, with either three right runs and two up runs or vice versa.

So, let me split this into two cases: starting with a right move and starting with an up move. For each case, I'll calculate the number of possible paths and sum them up.

So, let's define:

Case 1: Starting with right. Then runs are right, up, right, up, right. So, three right runs and two up runs.

Case 2: Starting with up. Then runs are up, right, up, right, up. So, three up runs and two right runs.

Since the grid is symmetric, the number of paths in Case 1 should be equal to the number in Case 2. So, perhaps I can compute one and double it. But let me just confirm that.

Wait, actually, the grid is symmetric, but the direction changes are counted either way. So, perhaps the counts are the same. But to be thorough, I can compute both.

So, let's handle Case 1 first.

Case 1: Starting with right.

We have three right runs and two up runs.

Each right run must consist of at least one right move, and each up run must consist of at least one up move.

So, the total number of right moves is 8, and they are split into three runs. Similarly, the total number of up moves is 8, split into two runs.

So, this is equivalent to finding the number of ways to write 8 as the
