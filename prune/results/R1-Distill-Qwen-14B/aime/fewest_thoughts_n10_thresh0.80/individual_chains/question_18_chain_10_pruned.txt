Okay, so I've got this problem: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon). Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The problem mentions a diagram with three rectangles, but since I can't see the diagram, I'll have to imagine what they might look like.

First, I should recall what a regular dodecagon looks like. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is (n-2)*180/n, where n=12. So, (12-2)*180/12 = 150 degrees per angle.

Now, the problem is about forming rectangles inside this dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, I think this means that the sides of the rectangles are either edges of the dodecagon or lines connecting non-adjacent vertices (diagonals).

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting pairs of opposite sides or certain diagonals. For example, in a regular hexagon, you can form rectangles by connecting every other vertex, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so perhaps the number of rectangles is more than in a hexagon. Let me think about how rectangles can be formed.

A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. So, in a regular dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must be such that each corner is a right angle. But the dodecagon's internal angles are 150 degrees, so the angles inside the dodecagon aren't right angles. Therefore, the rectangles must be formed by connecting vertices in such a way that the sides form right angles.

Hmm, so perhaps the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon that cross each other at right angles. But how?

Another approach: maybe the rectangles are axis-aligned, but given that the dodecagon is regular, it's symmetric, so there might be multiple axes of symmetry. Wait, a regular dodecagon has 12 lines of symmetry: 6 through opposite vertices and 6 through the midpoints of opposite sides.

But I'm not sure if that's directly useful. Maybe I should think about how the diagonals in a regular dodecagon can intersect at right angles.

I remember that in regular polygons, certain diagonals can intersect at right angles. For example, in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. In a regular octagon, the same thing happens. So perhaps in a regular dodecagon, some diagonals cross at right angles, forming the corners of rectangles.

So, if I can find two pairs of parallel lines (each pair being sides or diagonals of the dodecagon) that are perpendicular to each other, their intersections can form rectangles.

Wait, but how do I count them systematically?

Let me consider the vertices
