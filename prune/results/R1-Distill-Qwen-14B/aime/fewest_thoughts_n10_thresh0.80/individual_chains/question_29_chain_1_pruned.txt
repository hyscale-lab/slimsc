Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, there are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, and some points are collinear or lie on a circle. Hmm. Let me try to visualize this.

First, I know that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, for rectangle ABCD, sides AB and CD are equal, and sides BC and AD are equal. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, sides EF and GH are equal, and sides FG and EH are equal.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184. The question is asking for the length of CE.

Wait, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That seems important.

Let me sketch this out mentally. Let's assume ABCD is the first rectangle. Let me label it so that AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. So, A is top-left, B is top-right, C is bottom-right, D is bottom-left.

Then EFGH is another rectangle. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E and F must lie on the line DC. But wait, DC is the bottom side of rectangle ABCD. So, E and F are points on DC, with D, E, C, F in that order? Or maybe some other order. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order on the line is D, then E, then C, then F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C from E's perspective.

So, rectangle EFGH has E and F on DC line, and since it's a rectangle, sides EF and GH are equal and sides FG and EH are equal. Given that EF = 184 and FG =17.

Wait, EF is one side of the rectangle EFGH. So, the length of EF is 184, which is the top side? Or maybe it's the right side? Wait, rectangles can be placed in different orientations, but since E and F are on DC, which is the base of ABCD, the rectangle EFGH is probably constructed such that EF is a horizontal side.

So, EF is 184 units long, lying along DC, which is the base of ABCD. So, E is somewhere on DC, closer to D, and F is 184 units away from E towards C. But since DC itself is only 107 units long (since AB = 107 and ABCD is a rectangle, so DC = AB =107).

Wait, but EF is 184, which is longer than DC. That can't be. Oh, wait, maybe EF is not along DC. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the position of E and F.

Wait, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, DC is a line segment, and E and F are on the same line. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. So, DC is 107 units. Then, DE + EC = DC = 107. But EF is 184 units, which is the length of the side of the rectangle EFGH. So, from E to F is 184, but since E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, then the distance from E to F is EC + CF. So, EC + CF = 184.

But I don't know EC yet; that's what we're trying to find. Let's denote CE = x. Then, since DC = 107, DE = DC - EC = 107 - x. And then, CF = 184 - x, because EF = 184.

Now, rectangle EFGH: since EF is one side, FG is another side, which is 17. So, FG = 17, which is vertical? Or is EF a vertical side? Wait, not sure.

Wait, in rectangle EFGH, EF and FG are sides. So, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if EF is a horizontal line (since it's on DC), then FG would be vertical. So, from F, moving upwards (or downwards) 17 units to point G.

Wait, but the problem states that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A, D, H, G are concyclic. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Hmm, that's an important clue. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic, meaning that the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, or that the power of a point holds, etc.

Let me try to find coordinates for all these points because it might be easier to handle with coordinate geometry.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and DC is the base, point C will be at (107,0). Point B is at (107,16), and point A is at (0,16).

Now, E is on DC between D and C. Let me denote E as (e,0), where 0 < e < 107. Then, since EF = 184, and F is on the same line DC beyond C, so F would be at (e + 184, 0). But wait, DC is only 10
