Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

Alright, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. There are two scenarios given: one where she walks at a constant speed of 's' km/h, and another where she walks at 's + 2' km/h. Each scenario includes some time spent in the coffee shop, which is 't' minutes. The problem is asking me to find the total time her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, let me break this down. The walk is always 9 kilometers. But the speed changes, so the time taken changes. The time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. So, in both scenarios, the total time is the walking time plus 't' minutes. 

Wait, so in the first case, when her speed is 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes at the coffee shop. Similarly, when her speed is 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes 't' minutes. 

So, I can set up two equations based on this information. Let me denote the walking time as just the time she spends actually walking, not including the coffee shop time. 

So, for the first scenario: walking speed is s km/h, so the walking time is distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours. Then, the total time is 4 hours, which is the walking time plus t minutes. But wait, t is in minutes, so I need to convert it to hours to make the units consistent. 

Wait, 1 hour is 60 minutes, so t minutes is t/60 hours. So, the total time equation would be:

Walking time + Coffee time = Total time
9/s + t/60 = 4

Similarly, for the second scenario, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours. 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so 2.4 hours. Therefore, the equation would be:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

So, now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t. Let me do that.

(9/s + t/60) - (9/(s + 2) + t/60) = 4 - 2.4
Simplify:
9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2). To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The common denominator would be s(s + 2). So,

[9(s + 2) - 9s] / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6
Simplify numerator:
9s + 18 - 9s = 18
So, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

So, 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2) = 1.6s(s + 2)

So, 18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

Let me bring all terms to one side:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation. Let me write it more cleanly. Maybe multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, 1.6 * 10 is 16, 3.2 *10 is 32, and 18*10 is 180, but since it's negative, it's -180.

Wait, no, wait: 1.6 s^2 +3.2 s -18 =0. Multiply by 10:

16 sÂ² +32 s - 180 =0.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me compute 1.6*10=16, 3.2*10=32, 18*10=180. So yes, but the sign is negative,
