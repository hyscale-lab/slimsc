Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, primes p where p^2 divides n^4 + 1. So, n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2. That means that -1 is a fourth power modulo p^2. But wait, n^4 +1 ≡ 0 mod p^2 implies n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2. So, for such a prime p, -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p^2.

I remember that for primes, if a number is a residue modulo p, it's sometimes a higher power residue modulo p^2. But I'm not sure about the specifics here. Let's think about small primes and check if they satisfy this condition.

The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. Let's check each one to see if there's an n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by p^2.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if there's an n where n^4 +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n^4 mod 4 for n=1,2,3,... Since 1^4=1, 2^4=16, 3^4=81, etc. Modulo 4, n^4 is either 0 or 1. So, n^4 +1 mod 4 would be either 1 or 2. So, 1+1=2 mod 4, which is not 0. So, p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's see if there's an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n^4 mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since modulo 9, it repeats every 9 numbers).

1^4 = 1 mod 9
2^4 =16 mod9=7
3^4=81 mod9=0
4^4=(256) mod9: 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4, so 4 mod9
5^4=625 mod9: 625-9*69=625-621=4, so 4 mod9
6^4=(1296) mod9=0
7^4=2401 mod9: 2401 /9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7, so 7 mod9
8^4=4096 mod9: 4096 /9: 9*455=4095, 4096-4095=1, so 1 mod9

So n^4 mod9: 1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1 for n=1-8.

Looking for n^4 ≡ -1 mod9. Since -1 mod9 is 8. But in the list above, the residues are 0,1,4,7. So 8 is not among them. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5. Check if n^4 ≡ -1 mod25. Let's compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 24 (since mod25 repeats every 25 numbers, but maybe we can find a pattern).

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's note that for modulus p^2, if p is an odd prime, the multiplicative group mod p^2 is cyclic of order p(p-1). So, perhaps the existence of n^4 ≡ -1 modp^2 requires that the order of -1 divides 4, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe Euler's theorem applies, but perhaps it's better to test.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to look for primes where -1 is a quartic residue mod p^2. For that, I think that -1 needs to be a quartic residue mod p, and then maybe also mod p^2.

Wait, but maybe first check if -1 is a quartic residue mod p. So, for a prime p, the number of solutions to x^4 ≡ a mod p depends on the factorization of the polynomial x^4 +1. So, in the field GF(p), the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p has solutions only if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Hmm.

Wait, more accurately, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x^4 = -1 has a solution if and only if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Wait, no
