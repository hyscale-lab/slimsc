Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, I remember a torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis. The problem says the torus T is formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in its plane, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, that means when you spin it, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem talks about two scenarios: when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere and when it rests on the outside. In each case, they're tangent along a circle, and we need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference, r_i - r_o, which will be a fraction m/n. Finally, we have to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Let me visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere from the inside, so the sphere is larger, and the torus is snug inside. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus is bigger relative to the sphere, but actually, wait, the sphere has a radius of 11, which is larger than the torus's dimensions. Wait, the torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. So, the sphere is definitely larger.

Wait, no, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is outside. So, the sphere is fixed with radius 11, and the torus is placed inside it, touching along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's as if the sphere is inside the torus, but since the torus is just a surface, maybe it's more about the torus being outside the sphere, touching it from the outside.

Wait, not sure. Let me think.

First, let's recall some properties of a torus. The standard torus can be described in 3D coordinates. The equation is something like (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius.

In our case, R is 6 and r is 3. So, the equation is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

But the sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the two surfaces are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they are tangent along another circle.

We need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o.

So, first, let's consider the case where the torus is inside the sphere. The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. So, at points of
