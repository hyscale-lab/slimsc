Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about game theory here. It sounds like a variation of the classic Nim game, but with specific move options. Each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. So, the key is to find the losing positions for Alice, which would be the winning positions for Bob.

Wait, in game theory, a losing position is one where no matter what move you make, your opponent can force a win. So, if Bob can always respond in a way that puts Alice back into a losing position, then Bob can win. So, I need to figure out the pattern of losing positions.

Let me try to list out the positions for small n and see if a pattern emerges.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice. Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes the last one and wins. Wait, no, wait. If n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving n=1. Then Bob's turn: he takes 1 and wins. So Alice would not want that. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2, she can't take 4. So Alice's only option is to take 1. So Bob can win if Alice takes 1, which she has to. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice? Wait, no, because if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last one and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

If n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. Bob can't do anything. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can only take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes the last one and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. Wait, n=2 is a losing position for Bob? Wait no, earlier I thought n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So if Alice takes 1 from n=3, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for Bob, meaning Alice would be putting Bob in a losing position, so Bob would lose. So if Alice does that, she can win. So n=3 is a winning position for Alice.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should use Grundy numbers or the concept of P-positions and N-positions. P-positions are the losing positions where the previous player can force a win, and N-positions are the winning positions where the next player can force a win.

Wait, no, more accurately, in combinatorial game theory, P-positions are those from which the previous player can force a win (i.e., the next player loses with perfect play), and N-positions are those from which the next player can force a win.

So, in this game, since Alice goes first, if the starting position is a P-position, then the previous player (which doesn't exist here, since it's the first move) would win, meaning the current player (Alice) is in a losing position. So, if n is a P-position, Bob can win.

So, our goal is to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a P-position.

Let me try to find the P-positions.

The base case: n=0. If there are 0 tokens, the game is over, so the player who just moved has won. So n=0 is a P-position because the player who is about to move cannot make a move and thus loses.

Wait, no: actually, in standard definitions, positions where the previous player can force a win are P-positions. So, n=0 is a terminal position where the previous player has won. So, n=0 is a P-position.

Now, for n=1: possible moves are to n=0 (by taking 1). So, since n=0 is a P-position, n=1 is an N-position (because you can move to a P-position and force the opponent into a losing position).

n=2: possible moves are to n=1 (by taking 1). Since n=1 is an N-position, moving to n=1 would mean the opponent is in an N-position, which is a winning position for them. Wait, but wait: if you can move to a P-position, then current position is N-position. If all moves from current position lead to N-positions, then current is a P-position.

Wait, let me get this right. The rule is: if any move from the current position leads to a P-position, then the current is an N-position. If all moves lead to N-positions, then current is a P-position.

So, let's compute P-positions step by step.

n=0: P-position.

n=1: can move to n=0 (P). So n=1 is N.

n=2: can move to n=1 (N). So all moves lead to N. So n=2 is P.

n=3: can move to n=2 (P) by taking 1. So n=3 is N.

n=
