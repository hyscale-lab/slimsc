Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize it and write down what's given.

First, there are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle, which means they are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. 

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let's label the rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. So, if AB is 107, then AB is the length, and BC is 16, so the height is 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle with length 107 and height 16. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. EF is 184, FG is 17. So EF is the length, FG is the height.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me think about how these rectangles are placed. Since D and C are corners of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are corners of rectangle EFGH. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the line goes through D, E, C, F in that order or some order.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's D, E, C, F collinear. So the order is D, then E, then C, then F. So on the line, starting with D, then E next, then C, then F.

So, the line starts at D, goes through E, then C, then F. So, the distance from D to E, then E to C, then C to F.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Hmm.

Let me try to draw this in my mind. Let me note the coordinates of the points to model this problem. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16, so moving from D(0,0), C would be at (16,0), since BC is the height. Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are length and width. So, if AB is 107, that would be the horizontal length, and BC would be the vertical height.

Wait, actually, in rectangle ABCD, AB is adjacent to BC. So, A is connected to B, which is connected to C, which is connected to D. So, if AB is 107, and BC is 16, then the rectangle has length 107 and height 16. So, if I place point A at (0,0), then B would be at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). Wait, but that would make AD the vertical side, which is 16 units. Hmm, but the problem says that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, maybe it would be better to assign coordinates in such a way that I can model both rectangles.

Alternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates to rectangle ABCD such that point D is at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, which is the vertical side, then C would be at (16,0). Then, point B would be at (16,107), and point A at (0,107). Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so moving from A to B to C to D and back to A. So, perhaps I need to be more precise.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates in a way that makes the line D-E-C-F horizontal. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and E and F are part of rectangle EFGH, which has EF = 184, FG =17. So, EF is the length, FG is the height.

Let me try again. Let's set up a coordinate system where the line D-E-C-F is the x-axis. So, let me place point D at (0,0). Then, since D, E, C, F are on the x-axis, and E is between D and C, and C is between E and F, then point E is at (e, 0), point C is at (c, 0), and point F is at (f, 0). But I think given the order D-E-C-F,
