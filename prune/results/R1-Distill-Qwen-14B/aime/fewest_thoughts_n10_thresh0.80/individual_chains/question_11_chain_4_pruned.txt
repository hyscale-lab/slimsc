Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, that means z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. So, I can represent z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make it easier to work with, especially since dealing with exponentials can sometimes simplify multiplication and division.

Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because the reciprocal of z is the conjugate divided by the modulus squared, and since |z| is 4, |z|^2 is 16, so it's (1/4) times the conjugate. But since z is 4e^{iθ}, its conjugate is 4e^{-iθ}, so 1/z is (4e^{-iθ})/16 = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Now, let's substitute z and 1/z into the original expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Compute 4*(75 + 117i):

4*75 = 300, 4*117 = 468.

So, 300 + 468i multiplied by e^{iθ}.

Similarly, the second part: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Compute (1/4)*(96 + 144i):

96/4 = 24, 144/4 = 36.

So, 24 + 36i multiplied by e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, now I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me express each term using Euler's formula.

First, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's expand the terms.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Multiply this out:

300*cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiply this out:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: ( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ ) i.

Now, add the two terms together.

The total real part is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ).

Let me compute this:

300 cosθ + 24 cosθ = 324 cosθ.

-468 sinθ + 36 sinθ = -432 sinθ.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

The imaginary parts are:

(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

Combine these:

300 sinθ -24 sinθ = 276 sinθ.

468 cosθ +36 cosθ = 504 cosθ.

So, the imaginary part is (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i.

But since we only care about the real part, we can ignore the imaginary part.

So, the expression we're trying to maximize is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay, so now I need to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

This is a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be expressed as a single sinusoid.

Recall that any expression of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be written as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²), and φ is some phase shift.

Alternatively, it can also be written as R sin(θ + φ), depending on the phase.

Wait, actually, more accurately, a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²), and tanφ = b/a.

Wait, let me double-check that.

Yes, the formula is:

a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²), and tanφ = b/a.

But in our case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, it's a cosθ + b sinθ, with a = 324, b = -432.

So, R = sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Let me calculate that.

324 squared: 324 * 324.

Well, 300² is 90000, 24² is 576, and 2*300*24=14400.

So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 90000+14400=104400, +576=104, 976.

Wait, wait:

300^2 = 90,000

300*24*2 = 14,400

24^2 = 576

So, 90,000 + 14,400 = 104,400; 104,400 + 576 = 104,976.

So, 324^2 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute that.

432 is 400 + 32.

So, 400^2 = 160,000

32^2 = 1,024

2*400*32 = 25,600

So, (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624.

So, 432^2 = 186,624.

But since the coefficient is -432, when we square it, it's the same as 432^2.

So, R = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624).

Let me compute
