Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number, N, such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that meets the condition.

The condition is that if any single digit is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. That means that for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 should give a multiple of 7. So, for example, if N is abcd (digits a, b, c, d), then replacing a with 1 should give 1bcd divisible by 7, replacing b with 1 gives a1cd divisible by 7, and so on for c and d.

This seems a bit involved, but maybe I can approach it systematically. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Each digit a, b, c, d is between 0 and 9, with a not zero since it's a four-digit number.

So, for each digit, replacing it with 1 gives a new number, and all four of those numbers must be divisible by 7.

Let me think about what each replacement would look like.

1. Replacing a with 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's call this number N1.

2. Replacing b with 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let's call this N2.

3. Replacing c with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. N3.

4. Replacing d with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these four numbers, N1, N2, N3, N4, we have:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me write these as congruence relations.

Starting with N:

N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d

Then,

1. N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7

But N1 can also be written as (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - 1000a + 1000*1 = N - 1000a + 1000. Wait, no, that's not helpful perhaps. Alternatively, note that N1 is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d, which is the same as N but with a replaced by 1. So, N1 = (N - a*1000) + 1000. So, N1 = N + (1 - a)*1000.

Since N1 ≡ 0 mod7, (N + (1 - a)*1000) ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, for N2: N2 = a*1000 + 100 +10c + d. Which is N - 100b + 100. So, N2 = N + (1 - b)*100. So, N2 ≡ N + (1 - b)*100 ≡ 0 mod7.

Similarly, N3 = a*1000 + b*100 + 10 + d. So, N3 = N - 10c + 10. Thus, N3 ≡ N + (1 - c)*10 ≡0 mod7.

And N4 = a*1000 + b*100 + c*10 + 1. So, N4 = N - d +1. So, N4 ≡ N + (1 - d) ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four congruences:

1. N + (1 - a)*1000 ≡0 mod7

2. N + (1 - b)*100 ≡0 mod7

3. N + (1 - c)*10 ≡0 mod7

4. N + (1 - d) ≡0 mod7

Let me note that 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7 can be precomputed.

Compute 1000 mod7:

Well, 7*142=994, so 1000 -994=6, so 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2, so 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3 because 7*1=7 so 10-7=3.

And 1 mod7 is 1.

So substituting these into the four congruences:

1. N + (1 - a)*6 ≡0 mod7

2. N + (1 - b)*2 ≡0 mod7

3. N + (1 - c)*3 ≡0 mod7

4. N + (1 - d)*1 ≡0 mod7

Let's reorganize each equation:

1. N ≡ (a - 1)*6 mod7

2. N ≡ (b - 1)*2 mod7

3. N ≡ (c - 1)*3 mod7

4. N ≡ (d - 1)*1 mod7

So, all four expressions for N mod7 must be equal. Therefore:

(a - 1)*6 ≡ (b - 1)*2 ≡ (c - 1)*3 ≡ (d - 1)*1 mod7

Let me denote k as this common value modulo7. So:

(a - 1)*6 ≡k mod7

(b - 1)*2 ≡k mod7

(c - 1)*3 ≡k mod7

(d - 1)*1 ≡k mod7

So, each digit (a, b, c, d) is related to k via the above equations. Also, since a is the thousands digit, it ranges from 1 to9, and b, c, d from0 to9.

So, let's express each digit in terms of k.

From the first equation:

6(a - 1) ≡k mod7

So, 6(a -1) mod7 =k

Similarly, 2(b -1) mod7=k

3(c -1) mod7=k

(d -1) mod7=k

So, perhaps I can express each digit as a function of k.

Let me solve for each digit:

From 6(a -1) ≡k mod7:

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, the inverse exists. 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse of6 is6.

Therefore, a -1 ≡6k mod7

So, a ≡6k +1 mod7.

But a is between1 and9, so a can be (6k +1) mod7, but since a is a digit, it must be that a is an integer between1 and9.

Similarly for b:

From 2(b -1) ≡k mod7:

Multiply both sides by inverse of2 mod7. 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so inverse is4.

Thus, b-1≡4k mod7 => b≡4k +1 mod7.

Again, b is between0 and9.

Similarly, for c:

3(c -1)≡k mod7.

Inverse of3 mod7 is5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, c -1 ≡5k mod7 => c≡5k +1 mod7.

c is between0 and9.

For d:

(d -1)≡k mod7 => d≡k +1 mod7.

d is between0 and9.

So, each digit is expressed in terms of k.

Since a, b, c, d are digits, their values are determined by k mod7.

So, let's list possible k from 0 to6.

For each k in 0,1,2,3,4,5,6:

Compute a, b, c, d in terms of k:

a = (6k +1) mod7.

But since a is from1-9, we can have a= (6k +1) mod7. If the mod gives 0, then a=7. Because 6k+1 can be 0 mod7, which would imply a=7.

Wait, let's think. Let me compute a as follows:

a = ((6k +1) mod7). But since a must be at least1, if ((6k +1) mod7)=0, then a=7.

Similarly for other digits, if mod is0, set to7 for a, but for others, perhaps.

Wait, no, for a, the thousands digit, it's from1-9, so a can be 1-9.

But when computing (6k +1) mod7, it can be 0, which would mean a=7 (since 7 mod7=0). Similarly, for b, c, d, if their mod expressions result in 0, they can be 7 or 0.

Wait, but d is from0-9. So, for each digit:

a: if (6k +1) mod7= m, then a = m if m ≠0, else a=7.

Similarly for b: (4k +1) mod7. If 0, then b=7, else b=m.

c: (5k +1) mod7. If 0, c=7, else c=m.

d: (k +1) mod7. If 0, d=7, else d=m.

Wait, but d's equation was d≡k+1 mod7, so if k+1 is 0 mod7, then d=7.

Similarly, a, b, c would adjust accordingly.

So, let's make a table for each k from0 to6:

Compute a, b, c, d:

k | a = (6k +1) mod7 | if 0, a=7 | else a | b=(4k+1) mod7 | if 0, b=7 else | c=(5k+1) mod7 | if 0, c=7 else | d=(k+1) mod7 | if 0, d=7 else
---|------------------|------------|--------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------
0 | (0 +1)=1 mod7=1 | no | 1 | (0 +1)=1 mod7=1 | no | 1 | (0 +1)=1 mod7=1 | no |1
1 | 6+1=7 mod7=0 →7 |7 |7 |4+1=5 mod7=5 |5 |5 |5+1=6 mod7=6 |6 |2
2 |12+1=13 mod7=6 |6 |6 |8+1=9 mod7=2 |2 |10+1=11 mod7=4 |4 |3
Wait, wait, let me correct that. For k=2:

a: 6*2 +1 =13 →13 mod7=6 → a=6

b:4*2 +1=9 mod7=2→b=2

c:5*2 +1=11 mod7=4→c=4

d:2 +1=3 mod7=3→d=3

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated for k=1:

For k=1:

a:6*1 +1=7 mod7=0 →a=7

b:4*1 +1=5 mod7=5→b=5

c:5*1 +1=6 mod7=6→c=6

d:1 +1=2 mod7=2→d=2

Similarly, for k=0:

a:6*0 +1=1→a=1

b:4*0 +1=1→b=1

c:5*0 +1=1→c=1

d:0 +1=1→d=1

k=3:

a:6*3+1=19 mod7=5 (since 14 is 2*7, 19-14=5) →a=5

b:4*3 +1=13 mod7=6→b=6

c:5*3 +1=16 mod7=2→c=2

d:3 +1=4→d=4

k=4:

a:6*4 +1=25 mod7=4 (25-21=4) →a=4

b:4*4 +1=17 mod7=3→b=3

c:5*4 +1=21 mod7=0→c=7

d:4 +1=5→d=5

k=5:

a:6*5 +1=31 mod7=3 (31-28=3) →a=3

b:4*5 +1=21 mod7=0→b=7

c:5*5 +1=26 mod7=5 (26-21=5) →c=5

d:5 +1=6→d=6

k=6:

a:6*6 +1=37 mod7=2 (37-35=2) →a=2

b:4*6 +1=25 mod7=4→b=4

c:5*6 +1=31 mod7=3→c=3

d:6 +1=7→d=7

So, compiling the results for each k from0 to6:

k | a | b | c | d
---|---|---|---|---
0 |1 |1 |1 |1 → N=1111
1 |7 |5 |6 |2 → N=7562
2 |6 |2 |4 |3 →N=6243
3 |5 |6 |2 |4 →N=5624
4 |4 |3 |7 |5 →N=4375
5 |3 |7 |5 |6 →N=3756
6 |2 |4 |3 |7 →N=2437

Now, looking at these N's, and looking for the greatest four-digit number, so the largest possible N.

Looking at the a digits first: the higher a is, the larger N is. So in the table, the rows with a=7, a=6, a=5, etc., from top to bottom.

Looking at k=1: N=7562

k=2: N=6243

k=3: 5624

k=4:4375

k=5:3756

k=6:2437

k=0:1111

So the largest N is 7562 when k=1.

But wait, is 7562 the number? Let's check if it satisfies the condition. Because not all k's might lead to a valid N that satisfies the divisibility by7 upon changing any digit to1.

Wait, but our approach was to define N such that when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7. So, in theory, the way we constructed N by setting N mod7 equal to k, and the digits each express k in terms of their respective coefficients, so each replacement should satisfy the condition.

But perhaps I should verify for k=1, N=7562.

Let me check replacing each digit with1 and see if the number is divisible by7.

N=7562.

Change the thousands digit to1: 1562.

Is 1562 divisible by7?

Let me compute 1562 ÷7.

7*223=1561, so 1562-1561=1. So remainder1, not divisible by7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, so this suggests that either I made a mistake in my reasoning, or perhaps k=1 doesn't work as expected.

Wait, maybe I messed up the way I constructed N. Let me re-examine the equations.

Wait, the initial setup was that N + (1 - a)*1000 ≡0 mod7, etc.

So, for k=1, N=7562. Let's compute N mod7.

Compute 7562 ÷7:

7*1080=7560, so 7562-7560=2, so N ≡2 mod7.

Now, check N1=1562. 1562 mod7: 1562-7*223=1562-1561=1→1 mod7. But N + (1 - a)*1000 =7562 + (1 -7)*1000=7562 -6000=1562, which we saw is 1 mod7. But according to the condition, it should be 0 mod7. So, this suggests that there's an inconsistency.

Wait, that's concerning. So, perhaps the approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I have to set N ≡(a -1)*6 mod7, but if that's the case, then with N=7562, (a-1)*6 mod7 is (7-1)*6=6*6=36 mod7=1, which matches N mod7=2? Wait, no, 36 mod7 is 1, but N mod7 is2. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me go back.

Wait, the first condition was N1 =1000 +100b +10c +d ≡0 mod7.

But N=1000a +100b +10c +d.

So N1 = (N - a*1000) +1000.

So N1 ≡ N - a*1000 +1000 mod7.

Which is (N mod7) - (a*1000 mod7) + (1000 mod7) mod7.

We know 1000 mod7=6.

So, N1 ≡ (N mod7) -6a +6 mod7.

And this must be 0 mod7.

Similarly, the same for N2, N3, N4.

So, for N1≡0 mod7:

(N mod7) -6a +6 ≡0 → N ≡6a -6 mod7.

Similarly, for N2:

N2 = a*1000 +100 +10c +d.

Which is (N -100b) +100.

So, N2 ≡ N - (100b mod7) + (100 mod7) mod7.

100 mod7=2, so:

N2 ≡ N -2b +2 mod7.

Set to 0: N ≡2b -2 mod7.

Similarly, N3:

N3 = a*1000 + b*100 +10 +d.

Which is (N -10c) +10.

Thus, N3 ≡ N - (10c mod7) + (10 mod7) mod7.

10 mod7=3, so:

N3 ≡ N -3c +3 ≡0 mod7 → N ≡3c -3 mod7.

N4:

N4 = a*1000 + b*100 +c*10 +1.

Which is (N -d) +1.

So, N4 ≡ N -d +1 ≡0 mod7 → N ≡d -1 mod7.

Thus, from these four conditions:

1. N ≡6a -6 mod7.

2. N ≡2b -2 mod
