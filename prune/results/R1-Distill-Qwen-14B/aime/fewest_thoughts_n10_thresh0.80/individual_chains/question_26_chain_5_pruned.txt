Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram to visualize the problem. Even though there's an Asymptote figure provided, drawing my own might help me understand the relationships between the points and lines.

So, triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Hmm, let me check if this triangle is valid. The sum of AB and BC is 5 + 9 = 14, which is greater than AC=10, so that's fine. Similarly, other sides add up appropriately, so the triangle exists.

Since ABC is inscribed in circle ω, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C to ω meet at D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the external homothety center or sometimes the exsimilicenter. Also, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC because the tangent points have equal angles with the sides.

Now, AD intersects ω again at P. So, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P, with AD being the secant line from A through D to P.

I need to find AP. Hmm, perhaps using power of a point could be helpful here since we have tangents and intersections with the circle.

Wait, yes, power of a point D with respect to ω. Since D lies on the tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² (since the tangents from a common external point are equal in length). So, DB = DC.

So, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

Wait, actually, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find the lengths of DB and DC, or perhaps express them in terms of other known quantities, then I can find DP * DA, which will be equal to DB².

But wait, I don't know DB or DC yet. Maybe I can find DB in terms of DA or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use similar triangles or harmonic division properties here.

Wait, another thought: triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. Let me compute some key properties, like the circumradius, coordinates, or angles, which might be helpful.

Maybe using coordinates would be a good approach. Let me set up a coordinate system.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, point A can be at (10, 0) since AC=10. Point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute the coordinates of point B.

Given the side lengths: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

So, points A(10,0), C(0,0). Let me find coordinates of B.

Let’s denote B as (x, y). Then, distance from B to C is 9: √(x² + y²) = 9 => x² + y² = 81.

Distance from B to A is 5: √((x - 10)² + y²) = 5 => (x - 10)² + y² = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x - 10)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81 => x² -20x
