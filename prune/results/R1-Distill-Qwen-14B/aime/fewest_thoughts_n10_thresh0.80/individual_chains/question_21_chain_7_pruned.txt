Okay, so I have this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what exactly that means. 

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

For example, they gave that 81 is 13-eautiful because when written in base 13, it's 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense. So, in base b, a two-digit number would be something like a* b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. So, a must be between 1 and b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c is between 0 and b-1.

The problem is asking for the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the two conditions.

Alright, so let's break this down. Let me denote the two digits in base b as a and c. Then, the number n in base 10 would be a*b + c. The sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum is equal to the square root of n. So, putting this together:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But n is a*b + c, so substituting that in:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Now, let me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a way to express it more simply. Let's see:

a^2 - a*b + 2ac + c^2 - c = 0

I notice that the terms with a are a^2 - a*b, and the terms with c are 2ac + c^2 - c. Let me factor a from the first two terms and c from the next two:

a(a - b) + c(2a + c - 1) = 0

Not sure if that helps directly, but maybe. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of b.

Let me rearrange the equation:

a*b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

So,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

Simplify that:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, the term (c^2 - c)/a must also be an integer. So, a must divide c^2 - c. 

That's an important point. So, for given a and c, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. Let's note that down.

Moreover, a is between 1 and b-1, but since b is the base, and a is a digit, a must be less than b. Similarly, c is between 0 and b-1.

Wait, but since n is a two-digit number in base b, a must be at least 1 and at most b-1, and c must be at least 0 and at most b-1.

So, let's think about the possible values of a and c. Also, since a and c are digits in base b, they can't be larger than b-1. So, for a given b, a can be from 1 to b-1, and c can be from 0 to b-1.

But we're trying to find the minimal b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So, for each b, how many pairs (a,c) satisfy the equation a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). 

Alternatively, since n = a*b + c and sqrt(n) = a + c, then n must be a perfect square. So, n must be k^2 where k = a + c. So, another way to think about this is that for each base b, we look for numbers n which are two-digit
