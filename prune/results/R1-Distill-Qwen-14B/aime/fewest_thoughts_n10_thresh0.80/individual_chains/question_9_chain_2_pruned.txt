Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm supposed to find the product of two real numbers x and y, both greater than 1. The condition given is that the logarithm of y^x with base x is equal to 10, and also the logarithm of x^{4y} with base y is equal to 10. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me see if I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the logarithm log_b(a) equals c means that b^c = a. So, if log_x(y^x) = 10, that should mean that x^10 = y^x. Similarly, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 implies that y^10 = x^{4y}. So I have two equations here:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find xy. Both x and y are greater than 1, so they're positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms are only defined for positive numbers.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, maybe I can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute into the second. Let me try that.

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x. Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier, maybe. So, ln(x^10) = ln(y^x). That becomes 10 ln x = x ln y. Hmm, okay, so 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, from equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}. Taking natural logs again, 10 ln y = 4y ln x. So, 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now I have two equations:

A. 10 ln x = x ln y
B. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, perhaps I can solve these simultaneously. Let me see. From equation A, I can express ln y in terms of ln x. Let me rearrange equation A:

From A: ln y = (10 ln x) / x

Then, substitute this expression into equation B. So equation B becomes:

10 * [ (10 ln x) / x ] = 4y ln x

Simplify that:

100 ln x / x = 4y ln x

Hmm, okay, let's see. Both sides have ln x, and since x > 1, ln x is positive, so I can divide both sides by ln x. So, 100 / x = 4y.

Simplify that:

100 / x = 4y → y = (100) / (4x) → y = 25 / x

Ah, okay, so y is 25 divided by x. That's a useful relationship. Let me note that: y = 25 / x.

Now, since I have y expressed in terms of x, I can substitute this back into one of the earlier equations to solve for x.

Let me choose equation A: 10 ln x = x ln y. Since y = 25/x, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x.

So substituting back into equation A:

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x)

Let me write that out:

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x

Hmm, let me bring all terms to one side to see if I can solve for x.

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln 25 = 0

Factor out ln x from the first two terms:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln 25 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Let me rearrange the equation:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln 25

Factor ln x on the left:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

ln x = [x ln 25] / (10 + x)

Hmm, I'm not sure if that's helpful yet, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln 25

Which is:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25

Divide both sides by x:

(10 + x)/x * ln x = ln 25

Which simplifies to:

(10/x + 1) ln x = ln 25

Hmm, still not obvious. Maybe I can find a substitution here. Let me let t = ln x. Then, ln x = t, so x = e^t.

Substituting, the equation becomes:

(10/e^t + 1) * t = ln 25

Which is:

t (10 e^{-t} + 1) = ln 25

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach.

Wait, let's think back to equation 1: x^10 = y^x, and we know y = 25/x. So substituting y into equation 1:

x^10 = (25/x)^x

Which is x^10 = (25^x) / (x^x)

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10 + x} = 25^x

Hmm, okay, so x^{x + 10} = 25^x

Can I write this as (x^{(x + 10)/x}) = 25? Because if I take both sides to the power of 1/x, I get x^{(x + 10)/x} = 25.

So that's:

x^{1 + 10/x} = 25

Hmm, maybe I can take the natural logarithm on both sides again:

ln(x^{1 + 10/x}) = ln 25

Which is:

(1 + 10/x) ln x = ln 25

So, (1 + 10/x) ln x = ln 25

Hmm, which is the same equation I had earlier. So maybe I can write this as:

( x + 10 ) / x * ln x = ln 25

Which is the same as:

( x + 10 ) ln x = x ln 25

Which gets me back to where I was. Hmm. So I need to solve for x in this equation. It's a transcendental equation, which probably doesn't have an algebraic solution. Maybe I can find x by trial and error or some substitution.

Wait, let me consider if x is a power of 25, maybe 5, 25, 125, etc. Let me test x=5.

If x=5, then y=25/5=5. So x=y=5.

Let's check equation 1: log_x(y^x) = log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) = 5, since 5^5=3125. But the problem says it's equal to 10, so that doesn't work.

Hmm, okay, so x=5 is too small. Let me try x=25.

If x=25, then y=25/25=1. But y must be greater than 1, so that's not acceptable.

Hmm, maybe x=25/ something? Wait, but x=25 gives y=1, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps trying x=10.

If x=10, then y=25/10=2.5.

Check equation 1: log_10( (2.5)^10 )

Wait, 2.5^10 is approximately (2.5)^2=6.2
