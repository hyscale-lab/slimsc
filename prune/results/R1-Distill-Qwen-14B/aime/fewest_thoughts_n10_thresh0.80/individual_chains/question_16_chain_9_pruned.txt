Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \)."

Hmm, I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, once I find that \( p \), I have to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that for primes \( p \), \( n^k \equiv -1 \mod p \) has solutions only under certain conditions. Specifically, \( -1 \) must be a power that's a multiple of the order of \( n \) modulo \( p \). But here, it's not just modulo \( p \), it's modulo \( p^2 \), and we need \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \).

First, let's think about primes where \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution. For \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) to have a solution, the multiplicative order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) must divide 8, since \( (n^4)^2 \equiv 1 \mod p \). But \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) implies \( n^8 \equiv 1 \mod p \), so the order must be exactly 8. Therefore, 8 must divide \( p-1 \) because the multiplicative group modulo \( p \) is cyclic with order \( p-1 \). So \( p \) must be congruent to 1 mod 8, i.e., \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).

Wait, but 2 is a prime as well. Let me check \( p = 2 \). If \( p = 2 \), then \( n^4 + 1 \) must be divisible by \( 4 \). Let's see: \( n^4 \) mod 4. If \( n \) is even, \( n^4 \) is 0 mod 4, so \( 0 +1 =1 \) mod 4, which is not 0. If \( n \) is odd, \( n \) is 1 mod 2, so \( n^4 \) is 1 mod 4, so \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) mod 4, which is also not 0. So \( p=2 \) isn't possible.

Similarly, let's check \( p = 5 \). Wait, 5 is 1 mod 4, but what about 1 mod 8? The next primes after 2: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. So the primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 41, 73, etc. Wait, no, 17 is 1 mod 8, but I think 17 is the first prime that's 1 mod 8.

Wait, wait, let's list primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc. So the primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 41, 73, 97, etc. So the smallest such prime is 17.

But wait, before jumping to 17, let me confirm if 5 or 13 might work. Because 5 is 5 mod 8, and 13 is 5 mod 8 as well. So maybe they aren't 1 mod 8, but perhaps they can still satisfy the condition.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong in my initial reasoning. Maybe the condition isn't only that \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \). Let me think again.

If \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \), then the multiplicative order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) is 8 because \( n^4 \equiv -1 \) implies \( n^8 \equiv 1 \mod p \). So the order is 8, which divides \( p-1 \) by Fermat's Little Theorem. Therefore, 8 divides \( p-1 \), so \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).

So the smallest such prime is 17. Let me confirm whether for \( p =17 \), there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \).

Let me compute \( n^4 \) mod 17 for small \( n \):

n=1: 1 mod17, 1^4=1
n=2: 16 mod17
