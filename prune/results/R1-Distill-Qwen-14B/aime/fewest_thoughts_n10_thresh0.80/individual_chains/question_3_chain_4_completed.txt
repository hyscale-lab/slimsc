Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has won a prize (because if all four numbers match, then certainly at least two do), P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we're looking for is P(A)/P(B).

So, let's break this down. We need to find P(A) and P(B). 

First, let's figure out P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. That's straightforward. In the lottery, she picks 4 numbers, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers. The probability that all four of her numbers are chosen is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

Total number of possible outcomes when choosing 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is the combination of 10 things taken 4 at a time. Let me calculate that: C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, total possible outcomes are 210.

The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1 because there's only one set of four numbers that matches exactly what Jen picked. So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Wait, no, hold on. Actually, in this case, Jen is not picking again; the lottery picks 4 numbers. So, the probability that Jen's 4 numbers are exactly the ones picked is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210. So, yes, P(A) is 1/210.

Next, we need to find P(B), the probability that Jen wins at least two numbers. Winning a prize means that at least two of her four numbers are among the four chosen. So, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers such that at least two of them are in Jen's chosen 4.

Hmm, calculating this directly might be a bit tricky because it's the complement of having fewer than two numbers. Alternatively, it's easier to compute the probability of having exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four matches and add them up.

Wait, exactly four is the grand prize, which is already accounted for. So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of having exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four matches.

But since we're dealing with combinations, let me think in terms of combinations. 

Let me denote:

- Let T be the total set of numbers: size 10.
- Jen picks a subset J of size 4.
- The lottery picks a subset L of size 4.

We need to compute the number of subsets L such that |J ∩ L| ≥ 2.

So, the number of such L is equal to the sum over k=2 to 4 of C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Wait, why?

Because to compute the number of subsets L with exactly k numbers overlapping with J, we choose k numbers from J (which has 4) and 4 - k numbers from the remaining 6 numbers not in J. So, the total number of L where |J ∩ L| = k is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). 

So, the total number of subsets L where |J ∩ L| ≥ 2 is the sum for k=2,3,4 of C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).

Let me compute each term:

For k=2:
C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

For k=3:
C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

For k=4:
C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for event B is 115, and the total number of possible outcomes is 210. Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

But wait, let me double-check that calculation. 90 + 24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(B) is 115/210. Let's simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5? 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. That's the simplified form of P(B).

Wait, 23 and 42 have no common factors because 23 is prime. So, P(B)=23/42.

Wait, hold on a second. Let me think again. When calculating the number of subsets L with exactly k overlaps, the formula is correct, right? Because for each k, we choose k from J and 4−k from outside J.

So, for k=2, 4 choose 2 is 6, 6 choose 2 is 15. 6*15=90.

For k=3, 4C3=4, 6C1=6. 4*6=24.

k=4: 1*1=1. So total 90+24+1=115.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to calculate P(B) is 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two matches, i.e., exactly 0 or exactly 1 matches.

So, total subsets L: 210.

Number of subsets with exactly 0 matches: C(6,4). Because all 4 numbers are chosen from outside J, which has 6 numbers.

C(6,4) is 15.

Number of subsets with exactly 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3). Because we choose 1 from J and 3 from outside.

C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20. So, 4*20=80.

So, subsets with 0 or 1 matches: 15 + 80 = 95.

Thus, subsets with at least 2 matches: 210 - 95 = 115. So, same result as before. So, P(B)=115/210=23/42.

So, that's correct.

Now, event A is winning the grand prize, which is when k=4. The number of subsets L where |J ∩ L|=4 is 1, so P(A)=1/210.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check.

P(A) is 1/210, P(B) is 115/210. So, when we take the ratio, the 210 cancels out, leaving 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m=1, n=115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, because 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with any number except itself.

Thus, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me verify once more because 1/115 feels a bit low, but considering that the probability of winning the grand prize is extremely low, and the probability of winning any prize is 23/42, which is about 0.5476, so the conditional probability being 1/115 seems plausible.

Wait, 1/115 is approximately 0.0087, which is about 0.87%, which seems low, but considering that the chance of getting exactly four is 1/210, and the chance of winning any prize is around 23/42, which is roughly 54.76%, so the ratio is indeed 1/115, which is about 0.87%.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of counts: since there are 115 subsets that give a prize, and only 1 of them is the grand prize, so the probability is 1/115.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the answer is m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we use the formula:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

Here, event \(A\) is winning the grand prize, and event \(B\) is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has won a prize, \(P(A \cap B) = P(A)\).

1. **Calculating \(P(A)\):**
   - The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).
   - There is only 1 favorable outcome for winning the grand prize.
   - Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

2. **Calculating \(P(B)\):**
   - We need the number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers such that at least two of them are in Jen's chosen 4. This is the sum of the number of ways to pick exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers from Jen's 4.
   - For exactly 2 matches: \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \).
   - For exactly 3 matches: \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \).
   - For exactly 4 matches: \( \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \).
   - Total favorable outcomes: \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \).
   - Thus, \( P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \).

3. **Calculating \(P(A|B)\):**
   - Using the conditional probability formula:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

4. **Simplifying the result:**
   - The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in its simplest form with \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \).
   - Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
