Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. So, the total number of steps is 16, and the number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for right moves, which is C(16,8).

But wait, the problem isn't just about any pathsâ€”it's specifically about paths that change direction exactly four times. I need to figure out how direction changes work here.

So, a path on the grid consists of moving either right or up. Each time the direction changes, the path switches from right to up or up to right. For example, if you move right a few steps, then up, then right again, each switch counts as a direction change.

Now, how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of segments in the path? Each direction change corresponds to a segment. So, if the path changes direction n times, it consists of n+1 segments. For example, if a path changes direction once, it has two segments: maybe all rights first, then all ups, or vice versa.

In this problem, the path changes direction exactly four times. That means the path is divided into five segments. Each segment is a consecutive run of right moves or up moves.

So, the path will have five segments, alternating between right and up. Now, the question is: how are these segments arranged? The starting direction could be either right or up, right? So, there are two cases: starting with right or starting with up.

Wait, but if we have five segments (since four direction changes), the number of right segments and up segments would differ by at most one. Let me think. If we start with right, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. So, that's three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if we start with up, it would be U, R, U, R, U: three up segments
