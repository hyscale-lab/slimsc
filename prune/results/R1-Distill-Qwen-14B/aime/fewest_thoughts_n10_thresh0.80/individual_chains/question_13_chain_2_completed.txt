Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She has two different walking speeds, and each time she stops at a coffee shop for t minutes. The question is asking, if she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, how long will her walk take, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, okay. So the walk is 9 km, and she walks at different speeds. I think I can model this with some equations. Let me see.

When she walks at speed s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, but 4 hours is the total time, right? So the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals 4 hours. Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which I should convert into hours or minutes to make calculations easier. 

Let me note down the given information:

1. First scenario:
   - Speed = s km/h
   - Total time = 4 hours = 4*60 = 240 minutes
   - So, walking time + t = 240 minutes.

2. Second scenario:
   - Speed = (s + 2) km/h
   - Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2*(60) +24 = 144 minutes
   - So, walking time + t = 144 minutes.

Wait, but the walking time is different in each scenario because the speed is different. So, the walking time is distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km in both cases.

So, for the first scenario, walking time is 9/s hours. But wait, no, in the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, but that includes the coffee shop time t. So, the actual walking time is (240 - t) minutes, which I can convert into hours by dividing by 60.

Wait, maybe I should work in hours to keep the units consistent. Let me think. 

So, if the total time is 4 hours, and t is in minutes, I can convert t into hours as t/60. So, the walking time is 4 - (t/60) hours. Similarly, for the second scenario, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours, or 144 minutes. So, the walking time is (144 - t) minutes, which is (144 - t)/60 hours.

Wait, maybe I should set up equations using hours. Let me try that.

In the first scenario:

Walking time (hours) + t (hours) = 4 hours.

Walking time = 9 km / s km/h = 9/s hours.

So, 9/s + t/60 = 4. Equation (1)

Wait, no, wait. Because t is in minutes. So, if t is in minutes, then t/60 is in hours. So, yes, that equation would be correct.

Similarly, in the second scenario, when speed is (s + 2) km/h:

Walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours.

Total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

So, the equation is:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4. Equation (2)

Wait, that seems correct. So now I have two equations:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate t.

Subtracting equation (2) from (1):

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

So, 9 (1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 1.6

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

That's (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) = 2/(s(s + 2))

So, 9 * [2/(s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Simplify:

18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6

So, 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2):

1.6s(s + 2) = 1.6s² + 3.2s

So, 18 = 1.6s² + 3.2s

Let me write this as:

1.6s² + 3.2s - 18 = 0

But dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16s² + 32s - 180 = 0

Wait, no, 1.6 * 10 is 16? Wait, 1.6 * 10 = 16? Wait, no, 1.6 * 10 is 16? Wait, no, that's not right. 1.6 times 10 is 16.0? Wait, no, 1.6 * 10 is 16.0? Wait, 1.6 * 10 is 16? No, 1.6 * 10 is 16, yes. Because 1.6 * 10 moves the decimal point once. So, yes, 16.

Wait, but 1.6s² *10 is 16s², 3.2s *10 is 32s, 18*10 is 180. So, equation becomes:

16s² +32s -180 =0

Hmm, let me see if I can simplify this equation by dividing through by a common factor. Let's see, 16, 32, 180. 16 and 32 are divisible by 16, but 180 is not. Wait, 16, 32, 180: 16 and 32 are divisible by 8. 180 is also divisible by 8?

Wait, 180 divided by 8 is 22.5, which is not integer. So maybe 4? 16 ÷4=4, 32 ÷4=8, 180 ÷4=45. So, let's divide equation by 4:

4s² + 8s -45 =0

So equation is 4s² +8s -45=0

That's better. Now, let's solve for s using quadratic formula.

Quadratic equation: ax² + bx + c =0, solution is x=(-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac))/(2a)

Here, a=4, b=8, c= -45

So, discriminant D = b² -4ac = 8² -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

sqrt(784) is 28

So, s = [ -8 ±28 ]/(2*4)

So, two solutions:

s = (-8 +28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

s = (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s=2.5 km/h

So, s is 2.5 km/h. Now, let's find t.

We can use equation (1):

9/s + t/60 =4

s=2.5, so 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours?

Wait, 9 divided by 2.5. Let me compute: 2.5 * 3 =7.5, 2.5*3.6=9. Yes, right. So 3.6 hours.

So, 3.6 + t/60 =4

So, t/60 =4 -3.6=0.4 hours

t=0.4*60=24 minutes

So, t is 24 minutes.

So now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5=3 km/h.

So her speed is 3 km/h, the distance is 9 km.

Walking time is 9/3=3 hours.

Plus coffee shop time t=24 minutes.

So total time is 3 hours +24 minutes = 3*60 +24=180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me recheck the calculations.

First, s=2.5, so s+2=4.5 km/h. Let's see if that matches the second scenario.

Time=9/(4.5)=2 hours. So walking time is 2 hours, plus t=24 minutes, which is 2 hours 24 minutes, which matches the problem statement. So that seems correct.

Now, the third scenario: speed is s + 1/2=3 km/h. So walking time is 9/3=3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Adding t=24 minutes, total is 204 minutes.

So, 204 minutes is the answer. Let me just write that as 204.

But wait, is there another way to calculate this? Let me think if I can derive it without going through the trouble of solving the quadratic or if I made any calculation errors.

Wait, let's see. Another way: since we have two equations, and knowing that s=2.5, t=24, so when speed is 3 km/h, time is 3 hours plus 24 minutes.

But yeah, that seems correct.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 204 minutes.


Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops for coffee for `t` minutes. When walking at speed `s` km/h, her total time is 4 hours (240 minutes). When walking at `s + 2` km/h, her total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes). We need to find the total time when she walks at `s + 1/2` km/h, including coffee time.

### Step 1: Set up equations based on the given scenarios.

1. **First scenario (speed = `s` km/h):**
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} \text{ hours (walking time)} + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours (coffee time)} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Convert 4 hours to minutes for consistency:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} \times 60 + t = 240
   \]
   \[
   \frac{540}{s} + t = 240 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. **Second scenario (speed = `s + 2` km/h):**
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} \text{ hours (walking time)} + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours (coffee time)} = 2.4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Convert 2.4 hours to minutes:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} \times 60 + t = 144
   \]
   \[
   \frac{540}{s + 2} + t = 144 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

### Step 2: Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate `t`.

\[
\frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s + 2} = 240 - 144
\]
\[
\frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s + 2} = 96
\]
Factor out 540:
\[
540 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 96
\]
Simplify the difference:
\[
540 \left( \frac{(s + 2) - s}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 96
\]
\[
540 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 96
\]
\[
\frac{1080}{s(s + 2)} = 96
\]
Multiply both sides by `s(s + 2)`:
\[
1080 = 96s(s + 2)
\]
Divide both sides by 24:
\[
45 = 4s(s + 2)
\]
Expand and rearrange:
\[
4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4(4)(-45)}}{2(4)}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
\]
Take the positive root:
\[
s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]

### Step 3: Find `t`.

Substitute `s = 2.5` into Equation 1:
\[
\frac{540}{2.5} + t = 240
\]
\[
216 + t = 240
\]
\[
t = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time for the new speed.

New speed: `s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3` km/h.

Walking time:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{minutes}
\]

Total time (walking + coffee):
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total time, including coffee, when Aya walks at `3` km/h is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
