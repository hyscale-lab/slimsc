Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It says:

Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z|=4 \).

Hmm, alright, let's try to break this down. I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions like this, it's often useful to express \( z \) in polar form because of the modulus condition.

Given that \( |z| = 4 \), I can write \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier since modulus is 4, so the magnitude is fixed.

But before that, let me look at the expression: \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

Hmm, since \( z \) is in the denominator, maybe I can simplify this expression by expressing \( 1/z \) in terms of \( z \)'s conjugate because \( |z| = 4 \), so \( 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2 = \overline{z}/16 \).

So, substituting that, the expression becomes:

\( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{16} \overline{z} \).

Wait, \( 96/16 = 6 \) and \( 144/16 = 9 \), so that simplifies to \( (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z} \).

Now, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), so \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} + (6 + 9i) \times 4e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( (6 + 9i) \times 4e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute the coefficients first:

First term coefficient: \( 4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i \).

Second term coefficient: \( 4(6 + 9i) = 24 + 36i \).

So the expression becomes:

\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Hmm, now I can express this using Euler's formula. Remember, \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, let's expand both terms.

First term:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Multiply this out:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta.

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), the last term becomes -468\sin\theta.

So, combining terms:

Real parts: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta.

Imaginary parts: 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta.

Similarly, the second term:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Multiply this out:

= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta.

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term is +36\sin\theta.

So, real parts: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.

Imaginary parts: -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta.

Now, adding both terms together:

Real parts: [300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta] + [24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta] = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

Imaginary parts: [300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta] + [-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta] = (300 - 24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta = 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta.

So the entire expression is:

Real part: 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

Imaginary part: 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta.

But the problem asks for the largest possible real part of the entire expression. So we only need to consider the real part.

Therefore, the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

We need to find the maximum of this expression with respect to \( \theta \).

Hmm, that's a linear combination of sine and cosine. I remember that any expression of the form \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) can be written as \( R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \tan\phi = B/A \).

Wait, in our case, it's \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which is similar but with a negative sign. So, maybe \( A = 324 \), \( B = -432 \).

So, the maximum value of \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) is \( R \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \).

So, let me compute \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Calculating 324 squared:

324 * 324: Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let me see, 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So 160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291600)?

Well, 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2 = 291,600 exactly because 54^2=2916, so 540^2 is 291600.

So R = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. Is the expression \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) indeed equal to \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) or something similar? Because the maximum is R, which is 540.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sign. Since the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which can be written as \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) where A=324, B=-432.

So the amplitude R is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) which is 540 as I found. So the maximum value of the real part is 540.

But wait, let me think again. Is this correct? The expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which can indeed be rewritten as R cos(theta + phi), where phi is the phase shift.

But regardless, the maximum value is R, which is 540.

So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me go back a bit. The expression we have is:

Real part = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, to find the maximum, we can compute R as sqrt(324² + 432²).

Wait, 324 is 4*81, which is 4*9²=36²=1296. Wait, no, 324 is 18², 18*18=324. And 432 is, let's see, 432 divided by 18 is 24, so 18*24=432.

But perhaps there's a common factor
