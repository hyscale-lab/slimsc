Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem involving a torus and a sphere. Let me see if I can break it down step by step.

First, I need to visualize what's going on. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. So in this case, the torus T is formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. That means the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what it means for the torus to be tangent to the sphere internally and externally. When the torus is inside the sphere, they touch along a circle, which I assume is the path where the two surfaces just meet without crossing. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

I think I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency. To do that, I should probably find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in both cases and use some geometry to find r_i and r_o.

Wait, but how are the torus and the sphere positioned? The torus is a surface, so when it's resting on the inside or outside, the centers might be aligned in a certain way. Let me try to model this mathematically.

Let me denote the center of the sphere as point O. The torus T has its own center, say point C. Since the torus is symmetric, point C should lie along the axis of revolution of the torus. The sphere S has a radius of 11, so when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from O to C plus the maximum distance from C to any point on the torus must equal 11. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the distance from O to C minus the minimum distance from C to any point on the torus must equal 11.

Wait, maybe I should think about it more precisely. Let me consider the torus T as a surface of revolution. The torus can be described in 3D coordinates, but perhaps using the standard parametric equations might complicate things. Alternatively, I can think about the cross-sectional view.

The major radius R of the torus is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So, the torus is like a donut with a tube radius of 3 and a center that's 6 units from the axis.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center O is at some distance from the torus's center C. The point of tangency would be where the sphere and torus touch each other. Let me imagine a cross-sectional view, where the torus is a circle of radius 3, centered at a point that's 6 units away from the origin (the axis). The sphere is centered at O, and in cross-section, the sphere would be a circle of radius 11.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere and the torus touch at a single point in the cross-section? Or along a circle? Hmm, I think in 3D, the tangency is along a circle, which corresponds to a point in the cross-section. Maybe not; perhaps in cross-section, the tangency is a single point. Wait, no. Because in 3D, the torus is a surface of
