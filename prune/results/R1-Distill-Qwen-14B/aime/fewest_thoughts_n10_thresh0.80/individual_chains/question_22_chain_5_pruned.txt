Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's start by visualizing the hexagon. Since it's equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in certain directions. But it's definitely not regular because the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of different lengths.

So, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, but here it's just equilateral, so sides are equal but angles can vary. Hmm, but with opposite sides parallel, maybe it's a type of affine regular hexagon? I'm not exactly sure, but I remember that affine transformations preserve parallelism and ratios of lengths.

Wait, maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but scaled along certain axes. So, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF is a larger triangle that encapsulates the hexagon, right?

Let me think about how these sides relate. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Since opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of AB and DE (assuming the order is A,B,C,D,E,F) might meet at a point, and similarly for the others.

Wait, actually, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, these lines will meet at three different points forming a triangle.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, let's denote the side length as 's'. Now, I need to relate 's' to the sides of this larger triangle, which are 200, 240, and 300.

I remember that when dealing with similar figures and extensions, the concept of similar triangles and ratios comes into play. But in this case, the hexagon isn't regular, but it's equilateral with opposite sides parallel, so maybe the triangle formed is similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides?

Wait, not necessarily. Alternatively, maybe the hexagon can be seen as a truncated version of this larger triangle. So, the hexagon is formed by cutting
