Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem says:

There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. We need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help here. Let me write down what I know.

First, log_x(y^x) = 10. Using logarithm properties, I can bring the exponent x down. So that would be x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let's think again.

Wait, log_x(a^b) is equal to b * log_x(a). So in this case, log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y). And that's given to be 10. So equation one is x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same rule, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to relate these two equations. I notice that the logs have swapped bases. In the first equation, it's log base x of y, and in the second, it's log base y of x.

I remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) is 1 / log_y(x). That could be useful here.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So substituting into the equations:

1. x * A = 10
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

Now we have:

Equation 1: x * A = 10
Equation 2: (4y) / A = 10

So from Equation 1, I can solve for x in terms of A: x = 10 / A.

From Equation 2, I can solve for y in terms of A: (4y) = 10A â†’ y = (10A) / 4 = (5A)/2.

So now I have x and y expressed in terms of A. Maybe I can relate them somehow.

Wait, but remember that A is log_x(y). So A = log_x(y). Since x and y are both greater than 1, their logs should be positive, so A is positive.

Let me write A in terms of x and y: A = log_x(y) = (ln y) / (ln x). Because changing the base using natural logs.

So A = (ln y) / (ln x). Hmm.

But I have expressions for x and y in terms of A. Maybe I can substitute x and y in terms of A into this equation.

We have x = 10 / A and y = (5A)/2.

So substituting into A = (ln y) / (ln x):

A = [ln (5A/2)] / [ln (10/A)]

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify this.

Let me denote B = A for simplicity. So:

B = [ln (5B/2)] / [ln (10/B)]

I need to solve for B. Not sure if this is straightforward algebraically. Maybe I can cross-multiply:

B * ln(10/B) = ln(5B/2)

Hmm, perhaps expand the logarithms.

Let me rewrite the left side:

B * [ln(10) - ln(B)] = ln(5B/2)

Which is:

B * ln
