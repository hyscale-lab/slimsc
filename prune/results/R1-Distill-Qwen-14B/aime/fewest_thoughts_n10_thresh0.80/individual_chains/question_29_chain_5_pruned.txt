Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which is interesting. 

The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. My goal is to find CE. Hmm, rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles are right angles. So, for rectangle ABCD, AB=CD=107, and BC=AD=16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF=GH=184, and FG=EH=17. Wait, no, wait. Wait, EF is given as 184, and FG is 17. So EF is one side, FG is the adjacent side. So in rectangle EFGH, EF=184 and FG=17, so the sides are 184 and 17.

So, let me try to sketch this mentally. Let's imagine rectangle ABCD. Let me label the points clockwise: A at the top-left, B at the top-right, C at the bottom-right, D at the bottom-left. So, AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. So AB=107, BC=16, so the rectangle is 107 units long and 16 units tall.

Then, rectangle EFGH. Let's say E is connected to F, F to G, G to H, and H to E. Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line goes through D, then E, then C, then F. So, D is connected to E, which is connected to C, which is connected to F. So, the line D-E-C-F is a straight line.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That must mean that ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. So, the four points lie on a circle. Interesting.

So, let me try to see how these rectangles can be arranged. Since D and C are adjacent corners of ABCD, and E and F are on the line D-E-C-F, perhaps rectangle EFGH is adjacent or connected in some way.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just saying that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. So, imagine the line D-E-C-F is a straight line, and the rectangles are arranged such that D and C are on this line, and E and F are also on this line, but they belong to the other rectangle.

Wait, so ABCD is a rectangle, EFGH is another rectangle, and the line D-E-C-F is a straight line. So, D is a corner of ABCD, and E is a corner of EFGH. Similarly, C is a corner of ABCD, and F is a corner of EFGH.

Also, the four points A, D, H, G are on a circle. So, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Hmm, perhaps I can assign coordinates to these points to model the situation. Let me set up a coordinate system.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then since DC is a side of the rectangle, let's say DC is along the x-axis. So, point C would be at (107, 0). Then, since BC is 16, point B would be at (107, 16), and point A would be at (0,16).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a rectangle, the
