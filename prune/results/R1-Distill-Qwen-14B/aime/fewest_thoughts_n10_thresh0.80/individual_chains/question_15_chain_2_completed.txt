Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. That makes sense because in an 8x8 grid, moving from one corner to the opposite requires 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps.

The key part is that these paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing directionâ€”so, a path alternates between moving right and up. Each time it switches from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if a path starts by moving right a few times, then switches to up, then switches back to right, each of those is a direction change.

Wait, but how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of segments in the path? Let me think. If a path changes direction four times, that means it has five segments. Because each direction change adds a new segment. So, starting with the first segment, each direction change adds one more segment. So four direction changes mean five segments in total.

Each segment is either all rights or all ups. So, in an 8x8 grid, the path must consist of some number of right segments and up segments. Since it's changing direction four times, it alternates between right and up five times. So, depending on whether it starts with right or up, the number of right and up segments will differ.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the path starts with a right or up move. So, I might have to consider both cases: starting with right or starting with up. But actually, in a grid from lower left to upper right, the movement is always towards the northeast, so the path will consist of both right and up moves, but the order can vary.

So, if the path changes direction four times, leading to five segments, each segment being a consecutive run of right or up moves. So, if it starts with a right, then the segments would be right, up, right, up, right, and so on. Similarly, if it starts with up, the segments would alternate accordingly.

But wait, the total number of direction changes is four, so the number of segments is five. So, the number of right segments and up segments can be either three right and two up, or two right and three up, depending on whether it starts with right or up.

Wait, not necessarily. Let's see.

If the path starts with right, then the sequence of segments would be right, up, right, up, right. That's five segments: three right and two up. Similarly, if it starts with up, the segments would be up, right, up, right, up, which is three up and two right.

So in either case, the number of segments is five, with three of one direction and two of the other. Therefore, the number of right segments is either three or two, and similarly for up.

So, to compute the number of such paths, I can model this as the number of ways to arrange these segments.

But each segment's length must be at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero length. So, each segment must be at least one step.

So, for a path that starts with right and has three right segments and two up segments, each right segment must be at least length one, and each up segment must be at least length one.

Similarly, for a path that starts with up and has three up segments and two right segments, each segment is at least length one.

So, the problem now reduces to distributing the remaining steps after assigning one step to each segment.

For the case starting with right:

Total right steps: 8. Number of right segments: 3. So, each right segment has at least 1 step, so we have 8 - 3 = 5 steps left to distribute among the right segments. Similarly, for up steps: 8 total, 2 segments each with at least 1 step, so 8-2=6 steps left.

Wait, no. Actually, the path starts with right, so the first segment is right, then up, then right, then up, then right. So, that's 3 right segments and 2 up segments.

Wait, but in terms of steps, each of the right segments must have at least 1 step, and each up segment must have at least 1 step.

So, for the right segments: 3 segments, each at least 1 step; total right steps: 8. So, the number of ways to distribute the remaining 8 -3 =5 steps among the 3 right segments is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 =5, which is C(5+3-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. Similarly, for the up segments: 2 segments, each at least 1 step, total up steps 8. So, 8 -2 =6 steps to distribute: number of solutions is C(6+2-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

Since the right and up distributions are independent, the total number of paths starting with right is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for the case where the path starts with up: 3 up segments and 2 right segments. Let's compute that.

For up segments: 3 segments, each at least 1 step; total up steps 8. So, 8-3=5 steps to distribute: C(5+3-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

For right segments: 2 segments, each at least 1 step; total right steps 8. So, 8-2=6 steps to distribute: C(6+2-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of paths starting with up is also 21 *7=147.

Therefore, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is 147 +147=294.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "change direction exactly four times." So, each direction change is a switch from right to up or up to right. So, starting with right, the number of direction changes is 4, which would mean five segments (right, up, right, up, right). Similarly, starting with up would give four direction changes, leading to five segments (up, right, up, right, up). So, in both cases, we have five segments, three of one direction and two of the other, as I thought earlier.

Hence, the total number of such paths is 147 +147=294.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other possibilities? For example, could the path have more segments but still only four direction changes?

No, because each direction change adds a new segment. So, four direction changes imply five segments, as each change switches the direction. So, the initial direction is the first segment, each change adds another segment. So, four changes lead to five segments.

Therefore, I think my calculation is correct: 294.

But I also need to confirm whether the approach is correct. Alternatively, this problem is similar to counting the number of lattice paths with a given number of direction changes, which is a known combinatorial problem.

In general, the number of paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with exactly k direction changes can be calculated by considering the number of ways to split the steps into runs, each run being a consecutive right or up move, and the number of runs is k+1.

So, in this case, m =8, n=8, k=4.

The number of direction changes is 4, so the number of runs is 5.

Thus, the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to split the right steps into t runs and the up steps into (5 - t) runs, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange these runs.

Wait, but in our case, the number of runs is 5, which are alternated between right and up.

So, the number of right runs can be either 3 or 2, depending on whether the first run is right or up.

Hence, the total number of paths is 2 * [C(8-1,3-1) * C(8-1,2-1)] + 2 * [C(8-1,2-1) * C(8-1,3-1)}] ?

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, the number of monotonic paths with exactly k direction changes can be calculated using the formula:

Number of paths = 2 * C(m-1, a) * C(n-1, b)

Where a + b = k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of stars and bars.

So, for a path starting with right: we have 3 right runs and 2 up runs.

Each right run must be at least 1, so the number of ways to distribute the 8 right steps into 3 runs is C(8-1, 3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, for the up runs: 8 steps into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7.

Multiply them: 21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with up: 3 up runs and 2 right runs: 21 *7=147.

Total: 294.

So, that's the same as my earlier result.

Hence, I think the answer is 294.


To solve the problem of counting the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths. 

Each path consists of 16 steps (8 right and 8 up moves). Changing direction exactly four times means the path is divided into five segments. These segments alternate between right and up moves, starting with either right or up. 

If the path starts with a right move, it will have three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, if it starts with an up move, it will have three up segments and two right segments. 

For each case, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the steps among the segments using the stars and bars method:

1. **Starting with right:**
   - Right segments: Distribute 8 steps into 3 segments, each at least 1. The number of ways is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
   - Up segments: Distribute 8 steps into 2 segments, each at least 1. The number of ways is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
   - Total paths starting with right: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

2. **Starting with up:**
   - Up segments: Distribute 8 steps into 3 segments, each at least 1. The number of ways is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
   - Right segments: Distribute 8 steps into 2 segments, each at least 1. The number of ways is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
   - Total paths starting with up: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

Adding both cases, the total number of paths is \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

**Answer:** The number of such paths is \boxed{294}.
