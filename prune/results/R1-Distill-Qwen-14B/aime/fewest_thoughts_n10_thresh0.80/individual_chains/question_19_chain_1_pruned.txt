Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. It says: In triangle ABC, the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. They tell me that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, okay. Let's try to visualize the triangle. I know that the circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors, and the incenter is where the angle bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is a segment from the incenter to vertex A, and OI is the segment connecting the incenter and the circumcenter. So, these two lines are perpendicular. That's an important piece of information.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be calculated using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check that formula to make sure. Yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that OI² = R² - 2Rr. Wait, no, is it R(R - 2r)? Let me compute it: OI² = R² - 2Rr. Yeah, that's right. So, plugging in the given R=13 and r=6, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me compute that. 13 squared is 169, 2*13*6 is 156. So, OI² = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). That's useful.

Wait, but the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle AIO is a right triangle at A. So, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Wait, no, IA is from I to A, and OI is from O to I. So, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the right angle is at I. So, in triangle AIO, the right angle is at I. So, we have triangle AIO with right angle at I, and sides IA, IO, and AO.

Wait, AO is the circumradius, right? Because O is the circumcenter, so AO is equal to R, which is 13. So in triangle AIO, AO=13, IO= sqrt(13), and IA is the inradius? Wait, no, IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A. Wait, no, IA is not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, not the vertex. Wait, I might have gotten confused here.

Wait, no, the inradius is the distance from I to any side of the triangle, but IA is the distance from
