Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. The point is called I, and it's equidistant from all four faces. That sounds familiar; I think it might be the incenter or something like that. 

First, let me jot down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, interesting. So opposite edges are equal. That makes me think this tetrahedron might have some symmetry. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I've heard of such terms before. I think an isosceles tetrahedron has all opposite edges equal, which is exactly what's happening here. So that might help in calculating some properties.

The problem is asking for the distance from the incenter I to each face. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, and this distance is called the inradius. The formula for the inradius (r) is the volume (V) divided by the surface area (A). But wait, in a tetrahedron, the surface area would be the sum of the areas of all four faces. So, r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area? Or is it r = V / A? Let me think. In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. For a tetrahedron, I think it's 3 times volume divided by the total surface area. Wait, no, maybe V divided by (A/3). Hmm, I need to get this right.

Wait, maybe I should look at the formula. In 3D, the formula for the inradius is V divided by the surface area. Because for a tetrahedron, each face contributes a kind of "base area" and the inradius is the height relative to each face. So, the volume is (1/3)*base area*height, and since all four heights are equal to r, maybe the total volume is (1/3)*A*r, where A is the total surface area. So, V = (1/3)*A*r, which implies r = 3V / A. Yeah, that makes sense. So, r = 3V / A.

So, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A. Then, compute r as 3V divided by A.

But how do I find V and A? Let's start with the surface area since that might be straightforward.

Each face is a triangle. The given edges are all pairs of opposite edges, which are equal, so each pair of opposite faces should be congruent. So, the four faces consist of two pairs of congruent triangles. Let me check:

Faces:

- ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.

Wait, actually, each face is determined by three edges. Let me think about the edges for each face.

Wait, maybe I
