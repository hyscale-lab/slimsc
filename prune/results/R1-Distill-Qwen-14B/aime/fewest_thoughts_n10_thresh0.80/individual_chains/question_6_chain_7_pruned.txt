Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit involved, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2|, so that's the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2, and then another absolute value. Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are double absolute functions, which might create some V-shaped or more complex graphs.

Let me try to sketch or at least visualize what f(x) and g(x) look like.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with its vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 would shift this V down by 1/2. But since we take the absolute value of that, any negative parts would flip up. So f(x) would be a W-shaped graph? Or maybe two Vs?

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Same idea: starting with |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So it would also create a W shape, but with a different shift.

Wait, maybe it's better if I draw the general shape of these functions.

For f(x):
- When x >= 0, |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|.
  - This is a V with vertex at (1/2, 0).
  - So for x >= 1/2, f(x) = x - 1/2.
  - For 0 <= x <= 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - x.
- Similarly, for x < 0, |x| = -x, so f(x) = |-x -1/2| = |x + 1/2|.
  - This is another V with vertex at (-1/2, 0).
  - For x <= -1/2, f(x) = -x -1/2.
  - For -1/2 <= x < 0, f(x) = x + 1/2.

So f(x) is a W-shaped graph with vertices at (-1/2, 0), (1/2, 0), and the minimum at these points. Wait, no, the absolute value makes it that f(x) is always non-negative. So the graph is a V on each side, symmetric about the y-axis, with the bottom at y=0 at x=1/2 and x=-1/2, and going up on either side.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:

The inner function |x| is symmetric. Subtracting 1/2, we have |x| - 1/2. Taking absolute value of that would make any part where |x| < 1/2 become positive again. So when |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so the absolute value flips it to 1/2 - |x|. When |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

So the graph of f(x) has a V shape where it's 1/2 - |x| between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, and then beyond that, it's |x| - 1/2, which is another V shape but starting from x = ±1/2, y=0.

Wait, so the graph is a V that peaks at (0, 1/2) and then goes down to zero at x = ±1/2, and then another V that goes up from there. So it's a W shape with the center at (0, 1/2) and the bottom at x=±1/2, y=0.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, the same logic
