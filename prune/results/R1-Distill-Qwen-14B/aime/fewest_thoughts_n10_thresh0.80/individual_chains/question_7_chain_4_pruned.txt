Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand it correctly.

Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue, each with equal probability. We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so to rephrase, we have a regular octagon with 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each color equally likely. We want the probability that by rotating the octagon, we can map all blue vertices to positions that were previously red.

Hmm, okay. So in other words, after some rotation, every blue vertex moves to a spot that was red before the rotation. That means the set of blue vertices must be a rotated version of the set of red vertices. Because the octagon is regular, the rotations correspond to symmetries, so each rotation will permute the vertices in a cyclic way.

I think the key here is to model the colorings and rotations as group actions. The group in question is the cyclic group C8, which has 8 elements corresponding to rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째. For each rotation, we can check if applying that rotation maps blue vertices to red ones.

But how do I count the number of colorings where such a rotation exists?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of orbits or using Burnside's lemma. Burnside's lemma is useful for counting orbits under group actions, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, I might need to compute the probability that the coloring is such that there's a rotation that sends blue to red.

Let me think about the colorings. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently, so there are 2^8 = 256 total colorings.

We need to count how many colorings have the property that there exists some rotation r such that when we apply r to the octagon, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red.

Let me denote the original coloring as C. After applying rotation r, the color at position i becomes the color that was at position (i - r) mod 8.

Wait, no. Actually, for a rotation
