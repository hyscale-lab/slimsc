Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is somewhere on the x-axis, halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis, a little less than 1 (since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866). 

Then, there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is like a line segment from some point (p,0) to (0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB. So, AB is part of the family F, I guess, since AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), and the length of AB is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is a segment in F.

So, we need to find point C on AB (other than A and B) such that C is not on any other segment from F. Then, we have to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q.

Hmm, so how do I approach this?

First, maybe parametrize the family F. Each segment PQ in F is from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1, because the length is 1. Wait, no, because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. So, for each PQ in F, p² + q² = 1.

So, the family F consists of all such segments where P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q) with p² + q² = 1.

So, now, any point (x,y) on PQ must satisfy the equation of the line PQ. Let me find the equation of a general PQ.

For a given p and q, the line PQ goes from (p,0) to (0,q). The slope would be (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Alternatively, rearranged, it's (x/p) + (y/q) = 1.

So, any point on PQ satisfies (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

Now, the point C is on AB. Let me parametrize AB first. Points on AB can be written as a linear combination of A and B. Since AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), the vector AB is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, parametric equations for AB can be written as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t

where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So, point C is somewhere on AB, which is the line segment AB. Let me denote C as (1/2 - (1/2)s, (sqrt(3)/2)s), where s is between 0 and 1, but since C is distinct from A and B, s is between 0 and 1, but not 0 or 1.

So, C = ( (1 - s)/2 , (sqrt(3)s)/2 )

Now, the condition is that C is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, to find such a point C, we need to ensure that C is not on any other PQ except AB itself. Since AB is in F, C is on AB, which is in F, but we want no other PQ in F to contain C.

So, the key is to find a point C on AB such that there's no other PQ in F that passes through C.

Alternatively, for all other PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ.

Thus, for C not to be on any other PQ, the equation (x/p) + (y/q) = 1 must have no solution (p, q) with p² + q² = 1, except for the specific PQ which is AB.

So, AB is PQ with P at (1/2,0) and Q at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check that: p =
