Okay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but let me break it down step by step. I remember that conditional probability is all about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. So, in this case, the event we're interested in is winning the grand prize, given that she's won a prize. So, using the formula for conditional probability, which is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). But in this case, since if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, the intersection is just the grand prize event. So, it simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B), where A is winning the grand prize and B is winning a prize.

Wait, let me think again: if you win the grand prize, you definitely have at least two numbers matching, so the event of winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, yes, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the formula becomes P(A)/P(B). So, I need to compute P(A), which is the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), which is the probability of winning any prize (i.e., at least two numbers matching).

First, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. So, how many possible ways are there to choose 4 numbers from 10? That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which is denoted as C(10,4).

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers.

Since Jen has picked a specific set of 4 numbers, the probability that the randomly chosen 4 numbers match hers exactly is 1/C(10,4) = 1/210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, let's compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which means having at least two numbers matching. So, this includes cases where she has exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers matching. But wait, in this problem, winning a prize is defined as having at least two numbers matching, so yes, it includes two, three, or four.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the probability of not winning a prize and subtracting that from 1. Alternatively, we can compute the sum of the probabilities of exactly two, three, and four matches. Let's see which is easier.

But since I'm dealing with combinations, maybe computing it directly is better. So, let's think about the number of ways that exactly k numbers match, where k = 2,3,4. Then, sum those up and divide by the total number of possible combinations.

So, for exactly k matches, the number of favorable combinations is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k). Wait, why 6? Because if k numbers are chosen from Jen's 4, the remaining 4 - k numbers must come from the numbers not chosen by Jen. Since Jen picked 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not picked by her. So, for exactly k matches, it's C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k).

So, for k = 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)
For k = 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)
For k = 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) which is 1*1 = 1.

Let me compute each term.

First, k = 2:
C(4,2) = 6
C(6,2) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15
So, 6*15 = 90

k = 3:
C(4,3) = 4
C(6,1) = 6
So, 4*6 = 24

k = 4:
As above, 1.

So, total favorable combinations for B (at least two matches) is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Wait, but let me check: the total number of possible combinations is 210, right? So, 115 is the number of favorable cases.

Therefore, the probability P(B) is 115/210. Let me simplify that: 115 divides by 5, 115/5=23, 210/5=42. So, 23/42. Hmm, wait, 23 is a prime, so 23/42 is the simplified form.

But wait, hold on. Let me double-check the computation of the favorable cases. So, for exactly two matches: 6 * 15 = 90. Exactly three: 4*6=24. Exactly four:1. So, 90+24+1=115. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(B)=115/210=23/42.

Wait, but let me think again: is there a better way to compute P(B)? Alternatively, compute the probability of having at least two correct numbers, which would be 1 minus the probability of having zero or one correct numbers.

Let me see if that approach gives the same result.

Compute the number of ways to have zero correct numbers: that is, choosing all four numbers from the 6 numbers not chosen by Jen. So, C(6,4)=15.

Number of ways to have exactly one correct number: C(4,1)*C(6,3). C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20, so 4*20=80.

So, total number of non-prize cases is 15 + 80 =95.

Therefore, the number of prize cases is total combinations (210) minus 95, which is 115. So, same as before. Therefore, P(B)=115/210=23/42. So, that's correct.

So, now, P(A)=1/210, P(B)=23/42.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B)=P(A)/P(B)= (1/210)/(23/42).

Let me compute that. So, (1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210)*(42/23)= (42)/(210*23). Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times because 42*5=210. So, 42/210=1/5. So, this becomes (1/5)/23=1/(5*23)=1/115.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, (42)/(210*23)= (42/210)* (1/23)= (1/5)*(1/23)=1/115. So, P(A|B)=1/115.

So, m=1, n=115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, because 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 has no common factors. So, m + n=1+115=116.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. So, 1/210 divided by 23/42.

Which is equal to 1/210 * 42/23.

42 divided by 210 is 1/5, so 1/5 * 1/23 is 1/115. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, is that right? Because 23/42 is the probability of winning a prize, and the probability of winning the grand prize given that is 1/115? That seems really low, but it might be correct, considering that winning a prize is not that rare, but winning the grand prize is very rare.

Alternatively, let me think of it in terms of counts.

Total number of prize cases:115. Number of grand prize cases:1. So, the probability is 1/115, yes. So, the answer is 1 + 115=116.

I think that's correct. So, the answer is 116.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

1. **Probability of winning the grand prize (P(A))**:  
   Jen wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. There is only 1 way this can happen:  
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
   \]

2. **Probability of winning a prize (P(B))**:  
   Winning a prize means having at least two matching numbers. We calculate this by subtracting the probabilities of having fewer than two matches from 1.  
   - Number of ways to choose 0 correct numbers: \( \binom{4}{0} \times \binom{6}{4} = 1 \times 15 = 15 \)  
   - Number of ways to choose 1 correct number: \( \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \)  
   - Total non-prize cases: \( 15 + 80 = 95 \)  
   - Prize cases: \( 210 - 95 = 115 \)  
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
   \]

3. **Conditional probability (P(A|B))**:  
   Using the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \):  
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

The probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
