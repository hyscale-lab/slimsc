Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives 150 degrees. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

The problem is about rectangles. So, I need to think about how rectangles can be formed by the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. A rectangle requires four sides with four right angles. But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles, so I need to figure out which combinations can form right angles.

I recall that in a regular polygon, the number of sides and the symmetry can affect the angles formed by the diagonals. So, maybe I should think about the diagonals in a dodecagon.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a circle. That way, each vertex can be represented as a point on the circumference, and the sides and diagonals correspond to chords of the circle. In that case, the rectangle would be determined by four points on the circle such that the chords connecting them form a rectangle.

Wait, but a rectangle inscribed in a circle must have its diagonals equal to the diameter of the circle. So, that means that the opposite vertices of the rectangle must be diametrically opposite each other. That seems important.

So, for a rectangle to exist in the dodecagon, it must have two pairs of diametrically opposite vertices. Because if the opposite corners are diametrically opposite, the sides would be chords of the circle, and the angles would be right angles if the sides are chords that are perpendicular.

Wait, no, not necessarily. Let me think. Suppose I pick two diametrically opposite points, say, vertex A and vertex A'. Then, to form a rectangle, I need two more points such that the sides from A and A' are equal in length and meet at right angles.

But perhaps a better way is to think in terms of vectors. If the dodecagon is inscribed in a unit circle, each vertex can be represented as a complex number or a point (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis.

In that case, for a rectangle, the vectors representing the sides from a vertex should be perpendicular (dot product zero) and have the same magnitude if they are sides of a rectangle. Alternatively, more precisely, the sides of the rectangle should correspond to chords that are perpendicular and of equal length.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about how many rectangles can be formed in a regular dodecagon.

First, a regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. Let's label them V0, V1, V2, ..., V11 in a clockwise manner.

A rectangle is determined by four vertices, say Vi, Vj, Vk, Vl, such that the sides ViVj, VjVk, VkVl, and VlVi are all either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon and form a rectangle.

But wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the steps between vertices. Because in a regular polygon, the length of a side or a diagonal depends on the number of edges apart the vertices are. For example, in a dodecagon, moving from V0 to V1 is a side, V0 to V2 is a diagonal that skips one vertex, V0 to V3 skips two, etc.

So, if two chords are to form a rectangle, their corresponding steps should be such that they are perpendicular. But how does the step relate to the angle between them?

Let me think: the angle between two chords (sides or diagonals) can be determined by the number of steps between the vertices. For instance, in a dodecagon, each step corresponds to an angle of 30 degrees because 360/12=30.

So, if I take a chord that connects two vertices with k steps apart, the central angle is 30k degrees. For two chords to be perpendicular, their central angles must differ by 90 degrees, or 30k - 30m = ±90. Let's see.

Wait, that might not be accurate because the angle between two chords isn't necessarily the difference in their central angles. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of vectors.

Each vertex can be represented as a vector from the center to the vertex. The angle between two vectors (chords) is the difference in their angles. So, if one chord corresponds to a central angle of θ and another to φ, the angle between them is |θ - φ| modulo 360.

But in a rectangle, the sides must meet at right angles. So, the angle between the vectors (chords) should be 90 degrees or 270 degrees. But since we're dealing with a convex polygon, the internal angles of the rectangle would be 90 degrees, so the angle between the sides should be 90 degrees.

Wait, no, because the vectors from the center to the vertices are at 30-degree increments. So, the angle between two such vectors is a multiple of 30 degrees. For two vectors to be perpendicular, the angle between them must be 90 degrees, which is 3*30 degrees.

So, two chords (sides or diagonals) will be perpendicular if the number of steps between their corresponding vertices is 3 or 9 (since 3*30=90 and 9*30=270, but 270 is equivalent to -90). So, the steps between vertices should be 3 or 9.

Wait, but steps of 3 would give a 90-degree angle between vectors, which is what we need for a rectangle.

So, perhaps for a rectangle, two of its sides must correspond to chords with steps of 3 and 4? Wait, no, that might not necessarily form a rectangle. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the dodecagon as a graph where each vertex is connected to others via edges (sides and diagonals), and a rectangle is a quadrilateral where all four angles are 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can have different lengths, so the rectangles must be formed by sides and diagonals that meet at right angles.

Alternatively, let me think about the rectangle in terms of vectors. If I have two vectors from the center, their difference vectors (the sides of the rectangle) must be perpendicular.

Wait, perhaps if I have four points A, B, C, D forming a rectangle, then vectors AB and AD must be perpendicular. But since A, B, C, D are all on the circle, perhaps this relates to the central angles.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of choosing two pairs of diametrically opposite points. Because for a rectangle inscribed in a circle, the opposite vertices must be connected by diameters. So, if I pick two diametrically opposite points, and then another two diametrically opposite points, such that the lines connecting them form a rectangle.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, in a square (which is a regular 4-gon), any two diametrically opposite points would be the opposite vertices of the square, and the sides are formed by the edges. But in a dodecagon, it's more complicated because there are more diametrically opposite points.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, each vertex has exactly one diametrically opposite vertex. For a dodecagon with 12 vertices, the diametrically opposite vertex is 6 steps away. So, V0 is opposite to V6, V1 opposite to V7, etc.

So, for a rectangle to exist, it must have two pairs of diametrically opposite points. That is, the rectangle must be formed by two such diameters.

So, to form a rectangle, I need to choose two diameters (i.e., two pairs of opposite vertices) such that the four points form a rectangle.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, not every pair of diameters will form a rectangle. The four points must lie in such a way that the sides are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this.

Suppose I have two diameters: one connecting V0 and V6, another connecting V3 and V9. These two diameters are perpendicular because the angle between V0 and V3 is 9
