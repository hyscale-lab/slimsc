Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: their sum is 300, and another equation involving their squares and products. Let me try to parse this.

First, the conditions are:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that meet both of these.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The first equation is linear, the second is a symmetric expression of degree 3. Maybe I can find a way to express the second equation in terms of the first or find some symmetry or substitution.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. So, for example, a²b is a squared times b, and so on. Let me write it out again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Wait, I can factor this expression a bit. Let me factor out common terms. For instance, a²b + a²c can be written as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

That's a bit cleaner. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me try that.

So substituting, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm. Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can rearrange this:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Okay, now I have an equation that involves a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. I wonder if I can relate these to the first equation, which is a + b + c = 300.

I recall some identities in algebra that relate sums of powers to each other. For example, the square of a + b + c is equal to a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, maybe I can find ab + ac + bc from that.

Let me calculate (a + b + c)²:

(300)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

So, 90,000 = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + ac + bc).

I can write this as:

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Hmm, maybe that can help me. Let me see if I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other known quantities.

I remember another identity: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, plugging in the known values, let's compute a³ + b³ + c³.

First, (a + b + c)^3 is 300³. Let me compute that:

300³ = 27,000,000.

Next term: 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) = 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) = 900*(ab + ac + bc).

Third term: 3abc.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Hmm, now let's go back to the equation I had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting a² + b² + c² from the first identity:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - [27,000,000 - 900*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)).

300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2(ab + ac + bc)) = -600(ab + ac + bc).

So that part is 27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc).

Now, subtracting [27,000,000 - 900*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc]:

So, 27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc.

Let me compute term by term:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0.

-600(ab + ac + bc) + 900(ab + ac + bc) = 300(ab + ac + bc).

And then -3abc.

So putting it all together:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me write this as:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

I can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

So, now the equation becomes:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, this seems more manageable. Let me denote S = ab + ac + bc and P = abc. Then the equation is:

100S - P = 2,000,000.

So, 100S - P = 2,000,000.

Also, from the first equation, a + b + c = 300, and we have S = ab + ac + bc.

I wonder if there's a way to express S and P in terms of a single variable or find some relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the equation 100S - P = 2,000,000 as:

P = 100S - 2,000,000.

So, P = 100S - 2,000,000.

But I also know that for nonnegative integers a, b, c, the values of S and P are related through the equation (a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc. Wait, but I used that earlier, so maybe another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can think of a, b, c as variables such that their sum is 300, and then express S and P in terms of that.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about the variables in terms of their possible values.

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, each of them can range from 0 to 300.

But dealing with triples (a, b, c) is complicated because of the high dimensionality. Maybe I can assume some symmetry or find a way to parameterize.

Wait, another idea: perhaps to fix one variable and express the others in terms of it.

Alternatively, since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps I can consider cases where two variables are equal, or all three are equal. But I'm not sure if that will cover all possibilities, but perhaps it can help.

Alternatively, perhaps assuming that one of the variables is zero. Let me see what happens if one variable is zero.

Let's suppose c = 0. Then, from the first equation, a + b = 300. The second equation becomes:

a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + b²a + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = ab(a + b).

Since a + b = 300, this simplifies to ab * 300 = 6,000,000.

So 300ab = 6,000,000 => ab = 20,000.

So, when c = 0, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

So, solving for a and b.

Let me write this as a quadratic equation: x^2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

The discriminant is 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

So, sqrt(10,000) = 100.

Solutions: x = [300 ± 100]/2 => x = (300 + 100)/2 = 200 or x = (300 - 100)/2 = 100.

So, when c = 0, the solutions are (a, b, c) = (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But since a and b are nonnegative integers, these are the only two solutions when c is zero.

Similarly, we can have a = 0 or b = 0. So, if a = 0, then b + c = 300, and the second equation becomes 0 + 0 + b²*0 + b²c + c²*0 + c²b = b²c + c²b = bc(b + c) = bc*300.

Set equal to 6,000,000: 300 bc = 6,000,000 => bc = 20,000.

So, similar to before, solving b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000.

This quadratic is x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0, same as before. The roots are 200 and 100, so the solutions are (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200).

Similarly, if b = 0, then a + c = 300, and the second equation becomes a²c + 0 + 0 + 0 + c²a + 0 = a²c + c²a = ac(a + c) = ac*300 = 6,000,000.

So, 300ac = 6,000,000 => ac = 20,000. So, a and c are 200 and 100, so the solutions are (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200).

So, when one variable is zero, we have 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 solutions. Each case where one variable is zero gives two solutions, and there are three variables that can be zero, so 3*2 = 6.

But wait, are these all distinct? Let me check.

(200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200), (200, 0, 100), (100, 0, 200). Yes, all six are distinct.

So, that's six solutions where one variable is zero.

Now, let's consider cases where none of the variables are zero. So a, b, c ≥ 1.

In this case, the second equation is 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, this seems challenging. Maybe we can let x = a, y = b, z = c, and the equation becomes 100(xy + xz + yz) - xyz = 2,000,000.

But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation:

xyz - 100(xy + xz + yz) + 2,000,000 = 0.

This looks a bit like a cubic equation, but in three variables. Maybe if I can fix one variable and solve for the other two.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the equation is symmetric, so maybe we can assume an order, say a ≤ b ≤ c, and then count the number of such triples and multiply by the number of permutations.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that will necessarily cover all cases, but perhaps it can help.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor the equation. Let me see.

Wait, the equation is xyz - 100(xy + xz + yz) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can add 100^3 to both sides to make it factorable.

Wait, sometimes, equations like this can be manipulated by adding a term to both sides to factor them.

Wait, let me think. If I add 100^3 to both sides:

xyz - 100(xy + xz + yz) + 100^3 + (2,000,000 - 100^3) = 0.

Wait, but 100^3 is 1,000,000. So 2,000,000 - 1,000,000 is 1,000,000.

So, perhaps:

xyz - 100(xy + xz + yz) + 100^3 = 1,000,000.

Hmm, let me see if the left side can be factored.

I think the left side is (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100).

Let me verify:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = xyz - 100xy - 100xz - 100yz + 100^2 x + 100^2 y + 100^2 z - 100^3.

Hmm, that's not the same as xyz - 100(xy + xz + yz) + 100^3.

Comparing term by term:

- The xyz term is the same.
- The next terms: -100xy -100xz -100yz in the expansion, but in our expression, it's -100(xy + xz + yz), which is the same.
- Then, the expansion has +100^2 x +100^2 y +100^2 z, but our expression has no such terms. So, it's different.

So, that approach might not help directly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider substituting variables. Let me set p = a - 100, q = b - 100, r = c - 100. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can think of the equation as
