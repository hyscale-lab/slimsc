Okay, so I have this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. The answer needs to be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, a regular octagon has 8 sides, so 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored either red or blue independently, each with probability 1/2. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the main task is to figure out how many of these colorings allow for a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps (like 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions), then all the blue points should end up where red points were before the rotation.

Wait, actually, to clarify: the rotation is applied to the octagon, which rearranges the vertices, and after this rotation, the new positions of the blue vertices should correspond to where the red vertices were before the rotation.

Hmm, maybe another way to think about it is that for a given coloring, there's a rotation that swaps red and blue in the sense that wherever there was a blue, after rotation it's now on a red, and vice versa. But wait, no, that might not necessarily be the case because the rotation just permutes the positions, but the color assignments are fixed.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me try to think again.

Suppose we have a coloring of the octagon. Let's denote the positions as 0 through 7. Each position has a color, red or blue. Now, we want to find a rotation (i.e., a cyclic shift by some k positions) such that for every position i, the color at position i after rotation is red if the original color at position (i + k) mod 8 was blue, and blue if the original color at (i + k) mod 8 was red.

Wait, no, that seems a bit convoluted. Let me think differently. If we rotate the octagon by k positions, then the color at position (i) moves to position (i + k) mod 8. So, after the rotation, the color at position j will be the color that was originally at position (j - k) mod 8.

So, for the rotation to satisfy the condition, after the rotation, all the blue vertices (in the original coloring) should be mapped to positions that were originally red. So, that means, for each original blue vertex at position i, after rotation by k, it's at position (i + k) mod 8, and the color at that position should have been red.

Wait, no. Let's clarify: After rotation by k, the color at position j is the original color at position (j - k) mod 8. So, for the rotated octagon to have all blue vertices where there were originally reds, that would mean that for every j, if the original color at (j - k) mod 8 was blue, then the color at j after rotation is blue. But we want all these blue
