Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem defines a number n as b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me start by understanding what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. A two-digit number in base b is of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1, and both a and c must be less than b. So, a can range from 1 to b-1, and c can range from 0 to b-1.

Now, the sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum must equal the square root of n. So, we have:

sqrt(n) = a + c
=> n = (a + c)^2

But n is also equal to a*b + c. Therefore:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Let me write that equation down:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2

I can rearrange this equation to solve for b. Let's move all terms to one side:

(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0

But maybe it's better to express b in terms of a and c. Let's try that.

Starting from:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Subtract a*b from both sides:

c = (a + c)^2 - a*b

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me rearrange differently.

Let me subtract a*b from both sides:

c = (a + c)^2 - a*b

Wait, perhaps expanding the right-hand side might help.

Expanding (a + c)^2 gives a^2 + 2ac + c^2. So,

a*b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2

Then, subtract (a*b + c) from both sides:

0 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c

Wait, that's the same as earlier. Maybe I can factor this differently.

Alternatively, let's move all terms except a*b to the right side:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

That looks better. So,

b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a

Simplify the numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

So,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

I can split the fraction:

b = (a^2)/a + (2ac)/a + (c^2 - c)/a

Simplify each term:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Hmm, since b must be an integer (as it's a base), the entire expression must evaluate to an integer. So, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

So, a must divide (c^2 - c), which is c(c - 1). Therefore, a | c(c - 1). 

Given that a and c are digits in base b, a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1. But since n is a two-digit number, c can be zero, but a must be at least 1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so a is at least 1, c can be 0 or more. But in the example, c is 3, which is less than b=13.

Now, since a divides c(c-1), and a is between 1 and b-1, while c is between 0 and b-1, I can perhaps find some relationship between
