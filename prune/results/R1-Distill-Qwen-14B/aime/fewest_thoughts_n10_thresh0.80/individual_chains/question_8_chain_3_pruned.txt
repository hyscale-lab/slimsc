Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that two conditions are satisfied: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complex, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. I have three variables a, b, and c, all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, which is straightforward. The second condition is a symmetric expression involving their squares multiplied by the other variables. That expression is 6,000,000.

I think symmetry might be a key here because the expression is symmetric in a, b, and c. So maybe I can find a way to express this in terms of symmetric sums or something similar.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I want to see if I can relate the second equation to the first one. Maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of (a + b + c) or other symmetric sums.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are among a, b, c. So, perhaps I can factor this expression.

Wait, let me try to factor the expression:

Let's consider a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So, the entire expression can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Which is equal to a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c), since a + b + c = 300, so (b + c) = 300 - a, etc.

So, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that looks a bit better. Let me write that as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Because when I distribute each term, I have 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³. So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So now, I have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I wonder if I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums. Let me recall some symmetric sum formulas.

I know that:

(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So, from this, I can express a² + b² + c² as (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, this becomes:

a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

Wait, also, I know that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3P

From the second equation, we have 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expressions in terms of S, Q, and P:

300(90,000 - 2Q) - [300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2Q):

= 300*90,000 - 300*2Q
= 27,000,000 - 600Q

Next, compute the bracket:

300³ = 27,000,000
3*300*Q = 900Q
So, [300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P] = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P

Putting it back into the equation:

[27,000,000 - 600Q] - [27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P] = 6,000,000

Let me expand this:

27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Simplify the terms:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600Q + 900Q) - 3P = 6,000,000

This simplifies to:

0 + 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3 to make it simpler:

100Q - P = 2,000,000

So, 100Q - P = 2,000,000. Let's write this as:

P = 100Q - 2,000,000

So now, I have expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of Q and P, and I've derived that P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, now I need to find nonnegative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300 and P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q and P must also be integers because they are sums and products of integers.

But perhaps another approach would help. Let me think about possible constraints on a, b, c.

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, each of them can range from 0 to 300.

Given that the second equation is a symmetric function, perhaps some of the variables are equal? Or maybe they take on specific values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider
