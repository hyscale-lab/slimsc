Okay, so I have this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what that means. The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me break this down. If a number has exactly two digits in base b, that means in base 10, n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1. Wait, actually, the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is equal to b in base 10, and the largest is (b^2 - 1) in base 10. So n must satisfy b ≤ n ≤ b^2 - 1.

Now, each two-digit number in base b can be written as d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. That means d1 can range from 1 to b-1 (since leading digits can't be zero), and d0 can range from 0 to b-1. So n = d1*b + d0. 

The second condition is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Let me write that down: d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Since n is d1*b + d0, we can square both sides of the equation to get (d1 + d0)^2 = n = d1*b + d0. 

So substituting, we have (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0. Let's rearrange that equation to solve for b. 

Expanding the left side: (d1 + d0)^2 = d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2. So the equation becomes:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange this to solve for b. Let's collect the terms with b:

- d1*b + (d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0) = 0.

So, moving the b term to the other side:

d1*b = d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0.

Thus, b = (d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0) / d1.

I can factor this as:

b = d1 + 2*d0 + (d0^2 - d0)/d1.

Since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, (d0^2 - d0) must be divisible by d1. That is, d1 must divide (d0^2 - d0). 

Let me write that as:

d1 | (d0^2 - d0).

So, for each base b, we can look at all possible pairs of digits d1 and d0 (with d1 from 1 to b-1 and d0 from 0 to b-1) and check if d1 divides (d0^2 - d0). If it does, then the number n = d1*b + d0 is b-eautiful.

But since we're looking for the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, I need to find how many pairs (d1, d0) satisfy this condition for each b and then find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Wait, but that seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider that for each b, the two-digit numbers in base b are from b to b^2 -1. Each such number n is equal to d1*b + d0, and d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). So sqrt(n) must be an integer because d1 and d0 are integers.

Therefore, n must be a perfect square. Let me write n as k^2, where k is a positive integer. So, k = d1 + d0, and n = k^2 = d1*b + d0.

So, substituting, we have:

k^2 = d1*b + d0.

But we also have k = d1 + d0, so d0 = k - d1.

Substituting back into the equation:

k^2 = d1*b + (k - d1).

Simplify:

k^2 = d1*(b - 1) + k.

Then,

d1*(b - 1) = k^2 - k.

So,

d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be within 1 to b-1.

So, for each base b, and each k where k = d1 + d0, which is sqrt(n), and n is k^2, we can find the possible d1 and d0.

But perhaps it's better to fix k and express b in terms of k and d1.

Wait, let's see. From above:

d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).

So, b = 1 + (k^2 - k)/d1.

Since b must be an integer, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by d1.

Moreover, d1 is a digit in base b, so 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1.

But since b = 1 + (k^2 -k)/d1, and d1 ≤ b-1, let's substitute:

d1 ≤ [1 + (k^2 -k)/d1] - 1 = (k^2 -k)/d1.

Multiply both sides by d1:

d1^2 ≤ k^2 - k.

So,
