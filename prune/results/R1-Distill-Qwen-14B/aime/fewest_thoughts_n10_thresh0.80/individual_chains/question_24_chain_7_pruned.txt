Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The problem is about a list of positive integers with three specific properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. Let me start by recalling some definitions.

First, the mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's a unique mode, so 9 appears more often than any other number. That means no other number can appear the same number of times as 9.

Next, the sum is 30. So all the numbers in the list add up to 30.

The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is an integer, and it's not in the list. Interesting.

So, to find the sum of squares, I first need to figure out what the list looks like.

Let me think about the mode first. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, the number of 9s must be at least two, because if it appeared only once, it wouldn't be a mode. But wait, if all numbers appeared once, there would be no mode. So, the mode implies that 9 appears more times than any other number.

So, let's denote the number of times 9 appears as m. Then, m must be greater than the number of times any other number appears.

Now, the sum is 30, so the total of all numbers is 30. Let's consider how many 9s there could be.

If m=2, then the two 9s add up to 18. The remaining sum is 30-18=12, which needs to be filled with other numbers, each appearing at most once, since 2 is the maximum frequency (since m=2 is the mode). Wait, but if another number appears twice, that would tie with 9 as mode, which is not allowed. So, all other numbers can appear at most once. Hmm, but wait, if m=2, then other numbers can appear up to once, but that would make the total sum of other numbers as 12, which can be split into numbers each appearing once. Let's see: for example, numbers like 1, 2, 3, 6: 1+2+3+6=12.

Wait, but the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, I need to arrange the numbers in order and find the median.

Wait, but first, let's figure out the possible lengths of the list. The number of elements in the list affects the median.

Let me think about possible lengths.

Suppose the list has n elements.

The median being an integer that's not in the list. So, if n is odd, the median is the middle element, which is an integer not in the list. If n is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must also be an integer not in the list.

Wait, but for even n, the average of two integers is an integer, so the two middle numbers must be both even or both odd. But the median is not present in the list.

Wait, but for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is in the list as the mode. That's a problem because the median can't be in the list.

Wait, wait. The median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if the median is 9, but
