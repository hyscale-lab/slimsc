Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the solution step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number, which is the largest possible, such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Interesting.

Alright, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. We're looking for the largest such N.

The key property here is that if you change any one digit of N to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: let's say N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits from 0 to 9, with A ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number.

When we change any one digit to 1, we get numbers like 1BCD, A1CD, AB1D, ABC1. Each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, we have four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Our goal is to find the largest N (i.e., ABCD as large as possible) satisfying these four conditions.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, we can probably start from 9999 and work downwards, checking each four-digit number to see if it satisfies these conditions. But that seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter approach.

Let me think about the conditions. Each modified number must be divisible by 7. Let's express each condition mathematically.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Wait, let me make sure I'm translating this correctly. For the first condition, replacing the first digit (A) with 1 gives 1BCD, which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Similarly for the others.

So, these four conditions must all be true.

Let me rewrite each condition as mod 7 equations:

1. (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. (1000A + 100B + 10 + D) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, perhaps I can express these in terms of N, the original number. Let's see.

N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, the four modified numbers can be written as:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A) = N - 1000A + 1000 = N + (1000 - 1000A)
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = 100 + (N - 1000A) = N - 1000A + 100
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D = 10 + (N - 1000A) = N - 1000A + 10
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = 1 + (N - 1000A) = N - 1000A + 1

Wait, maybe that's a bit convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each modified number as N with one digit changed. Let me see.

But another approach: instead of expressing in terms of N, perhaps I can find congruences for each digit.

Let me consider each condition separately.

First, condition 1: 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7.

We can compute 1BCD mod 7. Similarly for the others.

But perhaps it's better to express each condition in terms of N. Let's see.

Wait, another idea: since N is ABCD, and when we change A to 1, we get 1BCD.

So, N = ABCD = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, 1BCD = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

But 1000 ≡ 1000 mod 7. Let me compute 1000 mod 7.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So
