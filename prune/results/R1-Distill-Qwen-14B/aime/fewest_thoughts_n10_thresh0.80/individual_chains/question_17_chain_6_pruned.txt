Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I need to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what a rectangular box is. It's a three-dimensional figure with all sides being rectangles. So, it's like a box with length, width, and height, all possibly different. The surface area and volume are given, so I can write those equations down.

Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, z. Then:

Surface area S is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54.

Volume V is xyz = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain this box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere has to encompass the entire box. So, the sphere's diameter will be equal to the diagonal of the box.

The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is d/2, so r = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. Therefore, r squared is (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, I need to find the minimal possible value of (x² + y² + z²) given the constraints on surface area and volume, and then divide that by 4 to get r².

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that for such problems, we can use methods like Lagrange multipliers, but since this is a symmetric problem, maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

Let me write down the given equations:

1) 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 => xy + yz + zx = 27.

2) xyz = 23.

We need to minimize x² + y² + z².

I know that for any three real numbers, (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So, from this, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, if I can find the minimum of x² + y² + z², it's equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)^2 - 54. Therefore, minimizing x² + y² + z² is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)^2.

So, the problem now is to find the minimum value of (x + y + z)^2, given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of symmetric polynomials or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Let me try that.

Let’s denote f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which we need to minimize.

Subject to the constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx - 27 = 0,
h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

Using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of f should be a linear combination of the gradients of g and h.

So, ∇f = λ
