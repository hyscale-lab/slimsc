Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. We need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logs can be tricky sometimes, but I remember some properties that might help. Let me write down the equations first.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

I think I can use the logarithm power rule here, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that to both equations might simplify things.

Starting with the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = 10
Using the power rule, this becomes:
x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
Again, applying the power rule:
4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10

2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because of the change of base formula, log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, if I let log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k.

Let me set that up. Let k = log_x(y). Then log_y(x) = 1/k.

Substituting into the equations:

1) x * k = 10.

2) 4y * (1/k) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

xk = 10 ...(1)

(4y)/k = 10 ...(2)

I can express x and y in terms of k.

From equation (1): x = 10 / k.

From equation (2): (4y)/k =10 => 4y = 10k => y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k.

But I also know that k = log_x(y). Let's write that expression in terms of k.

Since k = log_x(y), by definition, that means x^k = y.

So, substituting the expressions for x and y from earlier into this equation:

x^k = y.

Substitute x = 10/k and y = (5k)/2.

So, (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

Let me write it out:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make this easier. Let's do that.

ln[(10/k)^k] = ln[(5k)/2].

Using the power rule on the left side:

k * ln(10/k) = ln(5k/2).

Let me expand the left side:

k * [ln(10) - ln(k)] = ln(5k/2).

So:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5k) - ln(2).

Wait, because ln(5k/2) is ln(5k) - ln(2).

But ln(5k) is ln(5) + ln(k). So,

Left side: k ln(10) - k ln(k)

Right side: ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

So, bringing all terms to the left side:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0.

Combine like terms:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(k) + (ln(2) - ln(5)) = 0.

Factor where possible. Let's see, the terms with ln(k):

(-k ln(k) - ln(k)) = -ln(k)(k +1).

So, the equation becomes:

k ln(10) - ln(k)(k +1) + (ln(2) - ln(5)) = 0.

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. I'm not sure if this is the best way to approach it. Maybe I should try to find a substitution or see if k is a nice integer.

Wait, let me think differently. Since x and y are greater than 1, k must be positive. Maybe I can guess a value for k that satisfies the equation.

Looking back at the equation (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Let me try k=2 first. Let's see what happens.

If k=2:

Left side: (10/2)^2 = 5^2 =25.

Right side: (5*2)/2=10/2=5.

25 ≠5, so nope.

Not equal. How about k=3?

Left: (10/3)^3 ≈ (3.333)^3 ≈37.037.

Right: (5*3)/2=15/2=7.5

Nope, not equal. How about k=1?

Left: (10/1)^1=10.

Right: (5*1)/2=2.5.

Nope. Maybe k=4?

Left: (10/4)^4=(2.5)^4= approx 39.0625.

Right: (5*4)/2=20/2=10.

Still no. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps k is a fraction. Let me try k= something like 0.5.

Wait, but k is positive, but if k=0.5, then x=10/(0.5)=20, y=5*(0.5)/2= (2.5)/2=1.25.

But y has to be greater than 1, which is okay.

Wait, let me compute the left side with k=0.5.

Left side: (10/0.5)^0.5 = 20^0.5 ≈4.472.

Right side: (5*0.5)/2=2.5/2=1.25.

Not equal. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe k is 5.

Left: (10/5)^5=2^5=32.

Right: (5*5)/2=25/2=12.5.

Nope.

Wait, maybe k= sqrt( something ). Alternatively, perhaps a substitution.

Wait, let me think again. I have the equation:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Let me write 10 as 2*5, so:

( (2*5)/k )^k = (5k)/2.

This might help.

So, (2*5/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm. Let me write (2*5/k) as (10/k).

Alternatively, I can take both sides to the power of 1/k.

Wait, not sure. Maybe it's better to take the natural log as I did before. Let me go back to that.

Equation after substitution:

k ln(10) - (k +1) ln(k) + ln(2/5) =0.

Wait, ln(2)-ln(5)= ln(2/5)= negative number.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

k ln(10) - (k +1) ln(k) = ln(5/2).

Wait, because ln(2/5)= -ln(5/2). So, I can write:

k ln(10) - (k +1) ln(k) = ln(5/2).

Hmm. Not sure. Maybe I can rearrange terms.

Let me bring all terms involving ln(k
