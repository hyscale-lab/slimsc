Okay, so I’ve got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let’s break this down. It sounds like a classic game theory problem, probably involving finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting position n is a losing position, then Bob can win. So I need to find all n ≤ 2024 such that n is a losing position.

Let me think about how to model this. Let’s denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The goal is to determine which positions are L, so that Bob can win when Alice starts there.

The base case is when n=0, which means no tokens are left. But the player who takes the last token wins, so if n=0, the game is already over, and the previous player has won. Wait, so in the context of the game, n=0 is a losing position because you can't make a move, so the player who is supposed to move when n=0 loses. Therefore, n=0 is an L position.

Then, for n=1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a W position.

n=2: The current player can take 1, leaving 1 token for the opponent who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, the current player can take 4, but that's not possible since there are only 2 tokens. So the only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then wins. So n=2 is W? Wait, wait. Wait, if I leave the opponent with 1, which is a W position for them, meaning they can win. So if the current player is at n=2 and takes 1, the opponent is at 1, which is a W position for them. So the current player can't force a win? Or can they? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let's think again. If n=2, player can take 1, leaving 1 token, which is a W position for the opponent. So opponent can take that last token and win. Alternatively, the player cannot take 4 from 2. So all moves from n=2 lead to the opponent winning. So n=2 is a losing position (L). Wait, that seems conflicting with my initial thought. So n=2 is L.

Wait, let's try to formalize this. For a position n, if there exists at least one move (taking 1 or 4 tokens) that leads to the opponent being in a losing position, then n is a W position. If all possible moves lead to the opponent being in a W position, then n is an L position
