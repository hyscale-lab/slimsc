Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere and I need to find the difference between two radii, r_i and r_o, where r_i is the radius of the circle where the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, and r_o is when it's externally tangent. Then, I have to express this difference as a fraction m/n and find m + n. Hmm, let's see.

First, I need to visualize the setup. A torus is like a donut shape, created by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6 units. So the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

The sphere has a radius of 11. So when the torus is placed inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle, and when placed outside, they are tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, the centers of these circles must lie along the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus. Also, the distance between the centers will be such that the surfaces just touch each other.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the distance between their centers plus the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center must equal the sphere's radius. Wait, maybe I should model this more carefully.

Wait, no. Actually, the torus can be thought of as a surface with two radii: R (the major radius, 6) and r (the minor radius, 3). When the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the sphere is at some distance from the center of the torus. Let me denote the distance between the centers as d.

In the internal tangent case, the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The maximum distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus should be equal to 11. Similarly, in the external tangent case, the minimal distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus should be 11, I think.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. When the torus is inside the sphere, the point on the torus closest to the sphere's center will be the point where the distance is 11 minus something. Hmm, maybe I should use the formula for the distance from a point to the torus.

Let me recall that the distance from a point to a torus can be found by considering the point's distance to the center of the torus and then subtracting or adding the major and minor radii appropriately, depending on the position.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the torus parametrically and then find the points where it's tangent to the sphere. But that might be complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the cross-section. If I take a cross-section of the torus and sphere in the plane that contains the axis of the torus, I can see circles representing the sphere and the cross-section of the torus.

In this cross-section, the torus would appear as two circles of radius 3, one on each side of the center. The distance between the centers of these two circles is twice the major radius, which is 12. Wait, no, the major radius is 6, so in cross-section, the torus would have a horizontal major radius of 6 and a vertical minor radius of 3. So, in the cross-sectional view, the torus is a circle of radius 3 centered at (6, 0) and another at (-6, 0). Hmm, maybe not.

Actually, the cross-section of a torus is a bit more complex. When you slice a torus with a plane that contains
