Okay, so I have this problem about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me try to understand the problem first.

A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81).

So, I need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

First, I should figure out how n relates to its digits in base b. Let me denote the two digits in base b as a and c. So, n can be written as a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit) and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum must equal sqrt(n). Therefore, we have the equation:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to group terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write it as:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Wait, maybe I can factor this differently. Alternatively, I can try to express this equation in terms of a and c.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Yes, that looks like a quadratic equation in a. So, for given c and b, a must satisfy this quadratic equation. Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square.

The quadratic in a is:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

The discriminant D is:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c^2 - c)
= 4c^2 -4bc + b^2 -4c^2 +4c
= (-4bc + b^2) +4c
= b^2 -4bc +4c

Hmm, so for a to be integer, D must be a perfect square. So, D = k^2 for some integer k.

So, D = b² -4b c +4c = k²

Let me factor this expression:

D = b² -4b c +4c = b² -4c(b -1)

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor it differently or express it in terms of (b - something). Alternatively, perhaps I can consider this as a quadratic in c.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that n = a*b + c, and sqrt(n) = a + c. So, n must be a perfect square. Let me denote m = sqrt(n) = a + c. Then n = m², so:

m² = a*b + c

But since m = a + c, we can substitute c = m - a into the equation:

m² = a*b + (m - a)
= a*b + m - a
= a*(b - 1) + m

So, m² - m = a*(b - 1)

Thus, a = (m² - m)/(b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (b-1) must divide (m² - m).

So, (b - 1) | (m² - m). That is, (b - 1) divides m(m - 1).

So, for each m, we can find possible values of b such that (b -1) divides m(m -1).

Additionally, since in base b, the digits a and c must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1 and 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1.

Given that a = (m² - m)/(b -1), and c = m - a.

So, let's write a and c in terms of m and b.

a = (m² - m)/(b -1)

c = m - a = m - (m² - m)/(b -1)

We also have the constraints that a must be at least 1 and at most b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.

So, let's write out these constraints.

First, a ≥ 1:

(m² - m)/(b -1) ≥ 1

Similarly, a ≤ b -1:

(m² - m)/(b -1) ≤ b -1

=> m² - m ≤ (b -1)^2

Also, c must be ≥ 0:

m - (m² - m)/(b -1) ≥ 0

Which can be written as:

m*(b -1) - (m² - m) ≥ 0

= m*b - m - m² + m ≥ 0

= m*b - m² ≥ 0

= m(b - m) ≥ 0

Since m is positive (as it's the sum of digits, which are positive integers), this implies that (b - m) ≥ 0, so m ≤ b.

Also, c must be ≤ b -1:

m - (m² - m)/(b -1) ≤ b -1

Let me write that:

(m(b -1) - m² + m)/(b -1) ≤ b -1

Multiply both sides by (b -1) (since b ≥2, so b-1 ≥1, so inequality sign doesn't change):

m(b -1) - m² + m ≤ (b -1)^2

Simplify numerator:

m(b -1) + m - m² = m*b - m + m - m² = m*b - m²

So, m*b - m² ≤ (b -1)^2

Rearranged:

m*b - m² - (b² - 2b +1) ≤ 0

= -m² + m b - b² + 2b -1 ≤0

Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to flip inequality):

m² - m b + b² - 2b +1 ≥0

Let me write this quadratic in m:

m² - m b + (b² - 2b +1) ≥0

Notice that b² - 2b +1 = (b -1)^2.

So, m² - m b + (b -1)^2 ≥0

This quadratic in m can be written as:

m² - m b + (b -1)^2

Let me compute its discriminant:

D = b² - 4*(b -1)^2 = b² -4(b² - 2b +1) = b² -4b² +8b -4 = -3b² +8b -4

For the quadratic in m to be always non-negative, the discriminant must be ≤0, so:

-3b² +8b -4 ≤0

Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to flip inequality):

3b² -8b +4 ≥0

Find where 3b² -8b +4 ≥0.

The roots of 3b² -8b +4=0 are:

b = [8 ± sqrt(64 - 48)] /6 = [8 ± sqrt(16)] /6 = [8 ±4]/6

So, b = (8+4)/6=12/6=2, and b=(8-4)/6=4/6=2/3.

So, the quadratic is positive when b ≤2/3 or b ≥2. Since b is an integer ≥2, the inequality holds for all b≥2.

So, the quadratic m² - m b + (b -1)^2 is always non-negative for b ≥2, which means that the inequality holds, so c ≤b -1 is automatically satisfied.

So, the main constraints are:

1. (b -1) divides m(m -1)
2. m ≤ b
3. a = (m² - m)/(b -1) must be integer and 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1
4. c = m - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1

So, perhaps I can approach this problem by fixing m and then finding possible b's, or fix b and find possible m's.

Wait, but since we're looking for the number of b-eautiful numbers, which correspond to different m's for a given b, we need to find the number of m's such that the above conditions are satisfied for each b, and then find the smallest b where this number exceeds 10.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to fix m and find how many b's satisfy the conditions for each m, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to iterate over possible b's and for each b, count the number of valid m's, then find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

Let's try to think about how to find the number of m's for a given b.

Given b, m must satisfy:

1. m ≤ b
2.
