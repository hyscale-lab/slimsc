Okay, so I have this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for their color. I need to place some of these chips in the grid, with each cell holding at most one chip. 

The conditions are a bit tricky. First, in any given row, all the chips must be the same color. Same goes for any column—all chips in a column must be the same color. So each row is either all white, all black, or has no chips, and each column is similarly restricted. 

Moreover, the third condition says that if I try to add any additional chip, it would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. That means the arrangement is maximal—no more chips can be placed without breaking the row or column uniformity. So, the configuration we're trying to find is such that every possible empty cell cannot have a chip without causing either its row or column to have mixed colors.

Hmm, okay. So the problem is to count the number of such maximal configurations.

Let me break it down. Since each row must be all one color or empty, and each column must be all one color or empty, I'm thinking that the grid will end up having certain rows and columns filled with chips of the same color, and the rest empty. But the arrangement must be such that every empty cell is either in a row that's already filled (so you can't add anything there) or in a column that's already filled (so you can't add anything there either). 

Wait, no—actually, if a row is filled with chips, then every cell in that row is occupied, so you can't add anything to that row. Similarly, if a column is filled, every cell in that column is occupied. But in the case of a maximal arrangement, every empty cell must be in a row that's not filled and a column that's not filled. But adding a chip to such a cell would conflict with either the row or the column's color. Therefore, the row and column of that cell must have their colors already determined in a way that adding a chip of either color would create a conflict.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the filled rows and columns. Let me consider that each row can be either entirely white, entirely black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But the empty rows and columns must be such that any cell in them is adjacent to either a filled row or a filled column that would prevent adding a chip of the opposite color.

Alternatively, maybe the filled rows and columns form a sort of partition of the grid. Let me think of the grid as being divided into four regions:

1. Rows and columns that are all filled (they are entirely white or black)
2. Rows that are filled, but their columns are empty
3. Columns that are filled, but their rows are empty
4. Rows and columns that are empty

But wait, perhaps that's complicating it. Let me think differently.

Suppose that each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But in the maximal case, every empty cell must be such that either
