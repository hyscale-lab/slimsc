Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are satisfied. Let me try to break it down.

First, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. Let me represent it as follows:

a b c
d e f

Wait no, maybe better to label each cell with variables. Let me think, the grid has two rows and three columns. So the first row has three cells: let's say A, B, C. The second row has D, E, F. So the grid looks like:

A B C
D E F

Okay, so the first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. So the first number is ABC, which is a three-digit number, and the second number is DEF, another three-digit number. So ABC + DEF = 999.

The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. So each column forms a two-digit number. So the columns are AD, BE, CF. So AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom." So each column has two digits, right? So each column is read as a two-digit number. So the first column is AD, which is 10*A + D. The second column is BE, which is 10*B + E. The third column is CF, which is 10*C + F. So the sum is (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

Got it. So that's the second equation: (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

So now, I have two equations:

1) ABC + DEF = 999
2) (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99

Let me express ABC and DEF numerically.

ABC is 100*A + 10*B + C.

DEF is 100*D + 10*E + F.

So equation 1 becomes:

(100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999.

Simplify that:

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Hmm, and equation 2 is:

10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99.

Let me write both equations:

Equation 1: 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99.

I can try to subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see if that helps.

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

(100A - 10A) + (10B -10B) + (C -0) + (100D - D) + (10E - E) + (F - F) = 999 - 99.

Calculating each term:

90A + 0 + C + 99D + 9E + 0 = 900.

Simplify:

90A + C + 99D + 9E = 900.

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Let me factor where possible.

Looking at 90A: that's 9*10A.

99D is 9*11D.

9E is 9E.

And then there's C.

So maybe factor a 9 from some terms:

90A + 99D + 9E + C = 900.

Which can be written as:

9*(10A + 11D + E) + C = 900.

So, 9*(10A + 11D + E) = 900 - C.

Since C is a digit (0-9), 900 - C ranges from 891 to 900.

So 9*(10A + 11D + E) must be between 891 and 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10A + 11D + E must be between 891/9 = 99 and 900/9 = 100.

So 10A + 11D + E is either 99 or 100.

Wait, wait. Wait, 891 divided by 9 is 99, exactly. And 900 divided by 9 is 100. So 10A +11D + E must be between 99 and 100. So it's either 99 or 100.

But 10A + 11D + E is an integer, so it can only be 99 or 100.

So two cases:

Case 1: 10A +11D + E = 99, and C = 900 -9*99= 900-891=9.

Case 2: 10A +11D + E=100, and C=900 -9*100=900-900=0.

So, in Case 1: C=9, and 10A +11D + E=99.

In Case 2: C=0, and 10A +11D + E=100.

Alright, so now I have two cases to consider. Let me handle each case separately.

First, let's note that in each case, we have certain constraints on variables.

Starting with Case 1: C=9.

So, 10A +11D + E =99.

I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions (A, D, E) such that 10A +11D + E =99, with A, D, E being digits (0-9). Wait, A is the first digit of a three-digit number, so A can't be zero. So A ranges from 1-9, D and E from 0-9.

Similarly, in Case 2: C=0.

So, 10A +11D + E=100.

Again, A is from 1-9, D and E from 0-9.

So, let's tackle Case 1 first.

Case 1: C=9, equation: 10A +11D + E=99.

We can write E=99 -10A -11D.

But E must be a digit (0-9), so 0 ≤ 99 -10A -11D ≤9.

Which implies that 90 ≤10A +11D ≤99.

So 10A +11D must be between 90 and 99, inclusive.

We can consider A and D such that 10A +11D is in that range.

We can let A vary from 1 to 9, D from 0 to9, and find the pairs (A,D) where 10A +11D is between 90 and 99.

Let me find possible (A,D):

Let me think of 10A +11D.

We can rearrange to 10A = 90 -11D + k, where k is the excess beyond 90, up to 9.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to iterate through possible D and see what A could be.

Alternatively, express A in terms of D:

From 10A = 90 -11D + something, but perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, think of 10A = 90 -11D + E, but E is from 0-9.

Wait, maybe it's better to iterate D from 0 up, and find possible A.

Let me list D from 0 to9 and see for each D, what A would satisfy 10A +11D ≥90 and ≤99.

So for each D, 10A ≥ 90 -11D.

So A ≥ (90 -11D)/10.

Similarly, 10A ≤99 -11D.

So A ≤ (99 -11D)/10.

But A must be an integer from 1-9.

Let me do this step by step.

D=0:

10A ≥90 → A≥9

10A ≤99 → A ≤9.9, so A=9.

So when D=0, A=9.

Then E=99 -10*9 -11*0=99-90=9. E=9, which is valid.

So D=0: (A,D,E)=(9,0,9).

D=1:

10A +11(1)=10A +11 ≥90 → 10A ≥79 → A≥7.9 → A≥8.

10A +11 ≤99 →10A ≤88 →A ≤8.8 → A=8 or 9?

Wait, 10A +11 ≤99 → 10A ≤88 → A ≤8.8, so A can be 8.

Wait, but A must be integer.

Wait, let me compute:

For D=1:

10A +11 ≥90 →10A ≥79 → A ≥8 (since 10*8=80 ≥79).

10A +11 ≤99 →10A ≤88 →A ≤8.8 → A=8.

Thus, A=8.

So E=99 -10*8 -11*1=99-80-11=8.

E=8, which is valid.

So D=1: (8,1,8).

D=2:

10A +22.

10A ≥90 -22=68 →A≥6.8 → A≥7.

10A ≤99 -22=77 →A≤7.7 → A=7.

So A=7.

E=99 -70 -22=7.

So D=2: (7,2,7).

D=3:

10A +33.

10A ≥90-33=57 →A≥5.7 → A≥6.

10A ≤99-33=66 →A ≤6.6 → A=6.

So A=6.

E=99 -60 -33=6.

D=3: (6,3,6).

D=4:

10A +44.

10A ≥90-44=46 → A≥4.6 → A≥5.

10A ≤99-44=55 →A ≤5.5 → A=5.

So A=5.

E=99 -50 -44=5.

D=4: (5,4,5).

D=5:

10A +55.

10A ≥90-55=35 →A≥3.5 →A≥4.

10A ≤99-55=44 →A ≤4.4 →A=4.

So A=4.

E=99 -40 -55=4.

D=5: (4,5,4).

D=6:

10A +66.

10A ≥90-66=24 →A≥2.4 →A≥3.

10A ≤99-66=33 →A ≤3.3 →A=3.

So A=3.

E=99-30-66=3.

D=6: (3,6,3).

D=7:

10A +77.

10A ≥90-77=13 →A≥1.3 →A≥2.

10A ≤99-77=22 →A ≤2.2 →A=2.

So A=2.

E=99 -20 -77=2.

D=7: (2,7,2).

D=8:

10A +88.

10A ≥90-88=2 →A≥0.2 →A≥1.

10A ≤99-88=11 →A ≤1.1 →A=1.

So A=1.

E=99 -10 -88=1.

D=8: (1,8,1).

D=9:

10A +99.

10A ≥90 -99= -9 → which is always true.

10A ≤99 -99=0 →10A ≤0 →A=0.

But A must be at least 1, so no solution for D=9.

So for D=9, no possible A.

So in Case 1, D can go from 0 to8, and each D gives exactly one A and one E.

So in total, 9 solutions for Case 1.

Each solution gives a specific A, D, E, and C=9.

So now, for each of these 9 possibilities, I can find the values of A, D, E, and C=9.

But wait, in the grid, we still have B and F variables. Because in the equations, I only used A, B, C in the first row, and D, E, F in the second.

Wait, no, in the first equation, ABC + DEF =999, which is 100A +10B +C + 100D +10E +F=999.

And the second equation is (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F)=99.

But when I subtracted, I got rid of B and F, but perhaps I need to express B and F in terms of other variables.

Wait, in the original equations, I have two equations but more variables. So perhaps I need to find relations between B and F.

Wait, in equation 2:

10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F =99.

But in equation 1:

100A +10B + C +100D +10E + F =999.

Let me write equation 2 again:

10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F =99.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(100A -10A) + (10B -10B) + (C -10C) + (100D - D) + (10E - E) + (F - F) =999 -99.

Which simplifies to:

90A + (-9C) +99D +9E=900.

Which is the same as earlier.

But I think I might have missed something else. Because in this case, for each solution in Case1, we have specific A, D, E, and C=9.

But in equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F =99.

But since C=9, 10C=90.

So equation 2 becomes:

10A + D + 10B + E + 90 + F =99.

Which simplifies to:

10A + D + 10B + E + F =9.

Wait, 99 -90=9. So 10A + D +10B + E + F=9.

But from equation1: ABC + DEF=999.

ABC=100A +10B + C=100A +10B +9.

DEF=100D +10E + F.

So 100A +10B +9 +100D +10E + F=999.

Which leads to 100A +10B +100D +10E +F=990.

Now, perhaps I can write:

100A +10B +100D +10E +F=990.

Let me factor terms:

10*(10A + B +10D +E) + F =990.

Divide both sides by 10:

10A + B +10D +E + F/10 =99.

But since F is a digit, F/10 must be an integer only if F=0. But that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the equation:

100A +10B +9 +100D +10E + F=999.

Subtract 9 from both sides:

100A +10B +100D +10E + F=990.

Let me divide the entire equation by 10:

10A + B +10D + E + F/10 =99.

But F must be a digit (0-9), so F/10 is 0 or 0.1, etc. Hmm, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Wait, maybe consider the equation modulo 10.

Looking at 100A +10B +9 +100D +10E + F ≡999 mod10.

Which gives 9 + F ≡9 mod10.

So 9 + F ≡9 → F ≡0 mod10.

But F is a digit, so F=0.

So from equation1, F=0.

So F is determined to be 0.

So now, knowing that F=0, let's plug back into equation2.

Equation2: 10A + D +10B + E +90 +0=99.

So 10A + D +10B + E=9.

Wait, but A is at least 1 (since it's the first digit of a 3-digit number), D is at least 0.

So 10A + D +10B + E=9.

But A≥1, so 10A ≥10. But 10A + D +10B + E=9.

But 10A is already ≥10, which can't equal 9. Contradiction.

Wait, that can't be. So in Case1, where C=9, we get F=0, which leads to equation2: 10A + D +10B + E=9.

But since A≥1, 10A ≥10, which is greater than 9. So this equation can't hold.

Wait, that's a problem. So in Case1, no solutions. Because 10A + D +10B + E=9 is impossible as A≥1.

Hmm, that suggests that Case1 doesn't contribute any solutions. So all the 9 solutions I thought are invalid because they lead to a contradiction.

Hmm, that's strange. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me go back.

Equation1: ABC + DEF=999.

Equation2: AD + BE + CF=99.

When I subtracted equation2 from equation1, I got:

90A + C +99D +9E=900.

Which I wrote as 9*(10A +11D + E) + C=900.

So 9*(10A +11D + E) =900 - C.

So 10A +11D + E=(900 - C)/9=100 - C/9.

But since 10A +11D + E must be integer, C must be divisible by 9. So C=0 or 9.

Ah, so C can only be 0 or9.

That's correct.

So in Case1: C=9, then 10A +11D + E=99.

In Case2: C=0, then 10A +11D + E=100.

So that's correct.

But in Case1, when C=9, I found that F=0, but that led to an inconsistency in equation2.

Wait, perhaps I should not have subtracted equations yet, but instead used F=0 in equation1.

Wait, let me redo equation1 with F=0.

Equation1: ABC + DEF=999.

Which is 100A +10B +9 +100D +10E +0=999.

So 100A +10B +100D +10E=990.

Divide by10: 10A + B
