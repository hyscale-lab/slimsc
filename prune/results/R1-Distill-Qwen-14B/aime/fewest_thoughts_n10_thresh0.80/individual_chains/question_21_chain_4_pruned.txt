Okay, so I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. From the problem statement, a number n is b-eautiful if when expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

Let me try to break this down. First, let's understand what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number would be of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero, so d1 must be at least 1 and at most b-1. Similarly, d0 can be from 0 to b-1.

So, n = d1 * b + d0. The condition for being b-eautiful is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) must be an integer (because d1 and d0 are integers, their sum is an integer), n must be a perfect square. Let me denote sqrt(n) as k, so n = k^2. Therefore, the condition becomes d1 + d0 = k.

Substituting n into the two-digit number equation: k^2 = d1 * b + d0. But since d1 + d0 = k, we can write d0 = k - d1. Substituting this into the equation:

k^2 = d1 * b + (k - d1)
Simplify that:
k^2 = d1 * b + k - d1
k^2 = d1 (b - 1) + k
Then, rearrange:
k^2 - k = d1 (b - 1)
So, d1 = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1)

Now, d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1. So, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since d1 is at least 1, we have:

(k^2 - k) / (b - 1) >= 1
Which implies:
k^2 - k >= b - 1
Or,
b <= k^2 - k + 1

Additionally, since d1 <= b -1, we have:

(k^2 - k) / (b - 1) <= b -1
Multiply both sides by (b-1):
k^2 - k <= (b -1)^2
So,
k^2 - k - (b -1)^2 <= 0

This is a quadratic in terms of k, but perhaps it's better to express b in terms of k.

Alternatively, let's think about possible values for k. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be at least b and at most b^2 -1. Since n = k^2, k^2 must be between b and b^2 -1. Therefore,

b <= k^2 <= b^2 -1

So, sqrt(b) <= k <= sqrt(b^2 -1) ≈ b - something small. But since k is integer, k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).

Wait, but the minimal k would be 2, because for b >=2, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b, so sqrt(b) is at least sqrt(2) ≈1.414, so the minimal integer k is 2.

Wait, but if n is a two-digit number in base b, the minimal n is b, which is 10_b. So, n must be >= b, which means k^2 >= b, so k >= sqrt(b). Similarly, the maximal n is (b^2 -1), so k^2 <= b^2 -1, so k <= sqrt(b^2 -1) < b.

So k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).

But perhaps it's better to find, for each b, all possible k where k^2 can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, and the digits sum to k.

Alternatively, for each b, we can find the number of k such that there exists d1 and d0 where:

1. n = d1*b + d0 = k^2
2. d1 + d0 = k
3. 1 <= d1 <= b-1
4. 0 <= d0 <= b-1

So, we can express d0 = k - d1. Then, substituting into n:

k^2 = d1 * b + (k - d1)
=> k^2 = d1 (b -1) + k
=> d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b -1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (k^2 -k) must be divisible by (b-1), and the result must be in that range.

So, for each b, we can look for integers k such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and the quotient is between 1 and b-1.

Alternatively, since (k^2 -k) = k(k-1), which is the product of two consecutive integers, this must be divisible by (b-1). So, (b-1) divides k(k -1).

Also, since d1 is (k^2 -k)/(b-1), and d1 <= b-1, we have:

(k^2 - k) <= (b-1)^2

So, for each b, the maximum possible k is such that k(k -1) <= (b-1)^2.

Let me try to find for each b, how many such k exist.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as:

For a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of integers k where:

1. k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, so b <=k^2 <= b^2 -1
2. (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1)
3. The quotient (k^2 -k)/(b-1) is between 1 and b-1.

So, to find for each b, the number of k satisfying these.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of b, and for each b, find all k such that:

k^2 = d1 * b + d0, and d1 + d0 =k.

Since d0 = k -d1, substituting into n:

k^2 = d1 * b + (k -d1)
So, k^2 = d1*(b -1) +k
So, d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b-1)

Which must be an integer, so (b-1) must divide (k^2 -k).

So, (b-1) | (k^2 -k) => (b-1) | k(k -1)

Since k and k-1 are coprime (consecutive integers), (b-1) must divide either k or k-1, or be a product of factors from each.

Wait, actually, since k and k-1 are coprime, any divisor of their product must divide either k or k-1. So, (b-1) must be a product of factors from k and k-1, but since they're coprime, (b-1) can be expressed as a product of two coprime numbers, say m and n, where m divides k and n divides k-1.

So, b-1 = m * n, where m divides k, n divides k-1, and gcd(m,n)=1.

This might be a useful way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps for each possible b, we can iterate through possible k such that k^2 is within the two-digit range in base b and check whether (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and whether d1 is within the required range.

Wait, but since we're looking for the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, maybe it's better to find a formula or pattern for how many b-eautiful numbers exist for a given b.

Let me think about the equation again:

d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b-1)

Since d1 must be integer and 1 <= d1 <= b-1, for each b, the number of valid k is the number of integers k where:

1. b <= k^2 <= b^2 -1
2. (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1)
3. 1 <= (k^2 -k)/(b-1) <= b-1

So, for each b, we can compute the possible k's.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express k in terms of b.

Wait, let's think about the equation:

d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b-1) => (b-1) d1 = k^2 -k

Which can be rewritten as:

k^2 - k - (b-1) d1 =0

This is a quadratic equation in k:

k^2 - k - (b-1) d1 = 0

The solutions to this quadratic equation are:

k = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4(b-1) d1)] / 2

Since k must be positive integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

So, 1 + 4(b-1) d1 must be a perfect square.

Let me denote m^2 = 1 + 4(b-1) d1, where m is an integer.

Then,

4(b-1) d1 = m^2 -1
=> (b-1) d1 = (m^2 -1)/4

Since (b-1) d1 must be integer, (m^2 -1) must be divisible by 4. That is, m^2 ≡1 mod4, which is true for all odd m. So, m must be odd.

Let me set m = 2t +1, where t is a non-negative integer.

Then,

m^2 = (2t +1)^2 =4t^2 +4t +1

So,

4(b-1) d1 =4t^2 +4t
Divide both sides by 4:

(b-1) d1 = t^2 + t = t(t +1)

So, (b-1) d1 = t(t +1)

Since d1 is at least 1 and at most b-1, t(t +1) must be between (b-1)*1 and (b-1)*(b-1).

So,

(b-1) <= t(t +1) <= (b-1)^2

Wait, t(t +1) is the product of two consecutive integers, which is roughly t^2. So, if t(t +1) is between (b-1) and (b-1)^2, then t is roughly between sqrt(b-1) and (b-1).

But perhaps this approach is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think about for each b, compute the number of k's that satisfy the conditions.

Let me think: for each b, the possible k's are such that k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, i.e., b <=k^2 <=b^2 -1.

So, k must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), floor(sqrt(b^2 -1))].

But sqrt(b^2 -1) is just a bit less than b, so k can be up to b-1.

So, k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.

For each k in that range, we can check if (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and if so, whether d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b-1) is between 1 and b-1.

So, for each b, the number of such k's is the number of divisors.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize in terms of d1.

We have (b-1) d1 =k^2 -k

So, (b-1) must divide k(k -1). Since k and k-1 are coprime, (b-1) must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k-1.

Therefore, for each b, (b-1) can be written as m * n where m divides k and n divides k-1, and m and n are coprime.

Thus, for each (m, n) such that m*n = b-1 and gcd(m, n)=1, we can set k = m * a and k-1 = n * c, with a and c being integers such that m*a -1 = n*c.

Hmm, this might be a way to find all possible k's for a given b.

But this might be getting a bit too abstract. Maybe it's better to approach this problem by fixing b and then finding all possible k's.

Let me try to find a way to compute, for a given b, the number of k's such that:

1. k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, so k is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1
2. (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1)
3. d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b-1) is between 1 and b-1.

So, for each b, let me denote that the number of such k's is the number of b-eautiful numbers.

We need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

So, perhaps it's better to find a formula for the number of k's given b.

Alternatively, maybe we can note that for a given b, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) in a certain way.

Wait, let's see.

We have (b-1) d1 =k(k-1). So, for each divisor d1 of k(k-1), we can set (b-1) = k(k-1)/d1. But since b must be an integer >=2, this suggests that for each pair of consecutive integers k and k-1, and for each divisor d1 of k(k-1), b is determined as [k(k-1)/d1] +1.

But perhaps that's not the right way to think about it
