Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

We have a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, that means AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Also, it's equilateral, so all sides are equal in length. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me visualize this hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal. Wait, but in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all opposite sides are parallel, so maybe this is similar but scaled somehow.

But the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF is a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. Interesting. So, if I extend these three sides, they form a triangle. Since the hexagon is convex, these extensions must meet at some points forming a triangle.

Let me try to sketch this in my mind. If I have a hexagon, and I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. Let's denote the triangle as T. The sides of T are 200, 240, and 300.

I think this problem might involve some properties of similar triangles or perhaps using the concept of similar triangles to relate the sides of the hexagon to the sides of triangle T.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon might be what's called a "parallel equilateral hexagon." I remember that in such hexagons, the sides can be extended to form a triangle, and the sides of that triangle are proportional to the sides of the hexagon.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a centrally symmetric hexagon. Because if opposite sides are parallel and the hexagon is convex, it's likely symmetric in some way.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for similar problems or recall any theorems related to this. I think there's a theorem or formula that relates the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides of a hexagon to the sides of the hexagon itself.

Let me think... maybe the triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon? Or perhaps the sides of the hexagon can be found using the lengths of T.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length of the hexagon is related to the harmonic mean or some other mean of the sides of triangle T.

Wait, let me think of coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the hexagon's vertices could help. But that might get complicated with too many variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles. Since opposite sides are parallel, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, each pair of lines (like AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA) are parallel. So the extensions of AB, CD, and EF will form a triangle, which is given.

I think I can model this as a triangle T with sides a, b, c (200, 240, 300) and the hexagon is inscribed in a certain way inside this triangle, with each side of the hexagon being a certain fraction of the sides of T.

Wait, perhaps the side length of the hexagon is related to the inradius or something of triangle T. But triangle T is not necessarily the same as the hexagon's circumcircle.

Alternatively, maybe each side of the hexagon is equal to a certain portion of the corresponding side of triangle T. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, I remember that in such a hexagon, the sides can be seen as being parallel and equal, and the extensions forming a triangle. The side length can be found using the formula involving the sides of the triangle.

After some research in my mind, I recall that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions of three non-consecutive sides (like AB, CD, EF) are proportional to the sides of the hexagon. The side length s of the hexagon can be found by the formula:

1/s = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's s = (a*b*c)/(a*b + b*c + c*a). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's the harmonic mean. The harmonic mean of 200, 240, 300.

Wait, let me compute the harmonic mean:

H = 3 / (1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300)

Let me compute that.

First, find the sum of reciprocals:

1/200 = 0.005

1/240 ≈ 0.00416667

1/300 ≈ 0.00333333

Adding them up: 0.005 + 0.00416667 + 0.00333333 ≈ 0.0125

So H = 3 / 0.0125 = 240.

Wait, that gives 240. But I'm not sure if the side length is the harmonic mean.

Alternatively, maybe it's the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals.

Wait, but 1/(1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300) = 1/0.0125 = 80. Hmm, but that doesn't match the triangle sides.

Alternatively, maybe the side length is the same for all sides, so perhaps the side length s can be found using similar triangles.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider that the triangle T is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by "truncating" the triangle T in some way.

So, maybe each side of the hexagon corresponds to a portion of each side of the triangle T. So, the triangle T is larger, and the hexagon is a smaller figure inside it.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as s.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, each side of the triangle T can be thought of as being composed of two sides of the hexagon and a portion that extends beyond.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is equal to the sum of two sides of the hexagon and some extension. But the hexagon's sides are opposite and parallel, so the extensions on each side of T would be equal.

Wait, maybe each side of the triangle T is equal to the side length of the hexagon multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle T is similar to a triangle formed by the hexagon's sides.

Wait, maybe I can model this by considering that each side of the triangle T is divided into three equal parts, each part being s. But I don't think that's necessarily the case.

Alternatively, maybe each side of the triangle T is equal to twice the side length of the hexagon. But 2*s would have to equal 200, 240, and 300, which is not possible because 2*s can't be all three at the same time.

Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, I recall that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions of three non-consecutive sides are proportional to the sides of the hexagon.

Wait, another thought: The triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon, but scaled by some factor.

Wait, no, maybe not similar. Since the sides are extended, the triangle T is larger.

Wait, perhaps the side length s of the hexagon is related to the sides of triangle T through the formula involving the area or something.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of similar triangles and ratios.

Let me think: when you extend sides AB, CD, and EF, each pair of opposite sides are parallel, so triangle T is formed by these extensions.

Each side of triangle T is formed by two extensions from the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps each side of T is equal to the side length of the hexagon plus some multiple of the side length.

Wait, maybe each side of T is equal to the side length multiplied by (1 + 2k), where k is some scaling factor.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a linear transformation.

Wait, perhaps if I think of the hexagon as being created by cutting off the corners of triangle T, each corner cut being a smaller triangle.

If that's the case, then each side of triangle T is equal to the side of the hexagon plus two times the length of the cut-off corner.

But I don't know the exact relationship.

Wait, perhaps the side length s of the hexagon is equal to the harmonic mean of the sides of triangle T.

Wait, earlier, when I tried the harmonic mean, it gave me 240, which is one of the sides of the triangle. That seems coincidental.

Alternatively, maybe the side length s is such that 1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300.

Wait, but let's compute that:

1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300 = (3/600) + (2.5/600) + (2/600) = (3 + 2.5 + 2)/600 = 7.5/600 = 0.0125

So 1/s = 0.0125 → s = 80.

Hmm, 80. Let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, if s = 80, then 200, 240, 300 are the extensions. Does 80 fit into the triangle in a way that each side is 80* something?

Alternatively, maybe s is 80, and each side of the triangle is 3*s in some way. But 3*80=240, which is one of the sides, but the others are 200 and 300, which don't fit.

Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, with opposite sides parallel, it can be thought of as a translation of a smaller triangle inside a larger triangle T.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is similar to T but scaled down. But the hexagon has six sides, so that might not be directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon can be partitioned into smaller triangles, each similar to T.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I think I've heard of a formula where the side length of such a hexagon is the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals of the triangle sides.

Wait, so s = 1/(1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300). Let me calculate that.

Earlier, I computed 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300 ≈ 0.0125. So s would be 1 / 0.0125 = 80.

Wait, so s = 80? That seems possible. Let me check.

If s = 80, then how does that relate to the triangle sides?

Alternatively, perhaps each side of the triangle T is equal to s multiplied by the sum of two terms. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of similar triangles and proportions.

Suppose that each side of triangle T is divided into three segments, each corresponding to the sides of the hexagon. But with six sides, that might not directly apply.

Wait, maybe each side of the triangle T is equal to the side length of the hexagon multiplied by some factor, say k, plus another factor.

Wait, perhaps the triangle T is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is formed by lines parallel to the sides of T, but offset inward by some distance.

If that's the case, then the ratio of the sides of the hexagon to the sides of T would be the same for each side.

But no, the triangle T has sides of different lengths (200, 240, 300), so the scaling factors would be different for each side, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the side length s is the same for all sides, so the offsets would have to adjust accordingly to maintain the same s.

Hmm, maybe I can model this with coordinate geometry. Let's assign coordinates to the triangle T and then see where the hexagon would fit.

Let me place triangle T in a coordinate system. Let me assume it's a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (200,0), and some point (x,y) such that the other sides are 240 and 300. Wait, but I need to make sure the sides correspond correctly.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates such that one vertex is at (0,0), another at (a,0), and the third at (b,c). Then, using the distances, I can find the coordinates.

But this might be tedious, but perhaps necessary.

So, let me attempt that.

Let me denote the triangle T with vertices at A(0,0), B(200,0), and C(p,q). Then, the distances AC = 240 and BC = 300.

So, distance from A to C is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 240.

Distance from B to C is sqrt((p-200)^2 + q^2) = 300.

So, we have two equations:

1. p^2 + q^2 = 240^2 = 57600

2. (p - 200)^2 + q^2 = 300^2 = 90000

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(p - 200)^2 + q^2 - (p^2 + q^2) = 90000 - 57600

Expanding (p - 200)^2: p^2 - 400p + 40000

So, p^2 -400p +40000 + q^2 - p^2 - q^2 = 32400

Simplify: -400p +40000 = 32400 → -400p = -7600 → p = (-7600)/(-400) = 19.

So, p = 19. Then, substitute back into equation 1:

19^2 + q^2 = 57600 → 361 + q^2 = 57600 → q^2 = 57600 - 361 = 57239 → q = sqrt(57239).

Compute sqrt(57239): Let's see, 239^2 = 57121, which is close. 240^2=57600. So sqrt(57239) is approximately 239.247.

So, the coordinates of C are (19, ~239.247).

Now, with triangle T having coordinates at (0,0), (200,0), and (19, 239.247). Now, the hexagon is inside this triangle, with sides AB, CD, EF extended to form T.

But wait, the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel. So, maybe the sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of T, but shorter.

Wait, in that case, the hexagon would be similar to T but scaled down. However, T is a triangle, and the hexagon is a hexagon, so that might not hold.

Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of triangle T, but that seems unlikely because the hexagon has three pairs of opposite sides, each pair parallel to a different side of the triangle.

Wait, yes! Since the hexagon has three pairs of opposite sides, each pair must be parallel to one side of the triangle T. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. So, each pair is parallel to a different side of T.

So, if AB is parallel to DE, which is parallel to one side of T. Similarly for the others.

So, perhaps each pair of opposite sides in the hexagon is parallel to a side of triangle T.

Given that, maybe the hexagon is formed by three lines parallel to each side of T, each line a certain distance from the sides.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal length s.

So, perhaps the distance between each pair of parallel sides (in the hexagon) is the same. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon is a "truncated" version of triangle T, where each side is replaced by a pair of parallel lines, each a distance s apart.

Wait, in that case, the triangle T would be similar to the outer triangle, and the hexagon is formed by cutting off smaller triangles from T.

Wait, yes, perhaps that's the case. Each corner of T is cut off by a line parallel to the opposite side, creating a smaller triangle at each corner, and the remaining figure is the hexagon.

If that's true, then the side length s of the hexagon would be proportional to the sides of T.

Wait, let me formalize this. Let's say that from each side of T, we cut off a smaller triangle by drawing a line parallel to the opposite side, at a distance such that the remaining figure is a hexagon with all sides equal.

In this case, the hexagon would have sides equal to the lengths of the cuts, and each pair of opposite sides would be parallel to the corresponding side of T.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all these cut lengths must be equal.

So, if I denote the scaling factor for each side as k, then each side of the hexagon would be k times the corresponding side of T.

Wait, but T has sides of different lengths, so scaling factors would vary. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the side length s of the hexagon to the corresponding side of T is the same for all sides.

But since T has sides 200, 240, 300, if the scaling factor is the same, then s would have to be the same proportion of each, which isn't possible unless s is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe another approach.

Let me consider that when we draw lines parallel to each side of T, the distance from each side of T to the corresponding parallel line is the same for all sides. But since the hexagon is equilateral, the distances must be chosen such that the lengths of the segments cut off are equal.

Wait, perhaps using similar triangles.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as s.

When we draw a line parallel to side AB at a distance such that the segment cut off has length s, the ratio of similarity would be (length of AB - 2s)/AB.

Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think.

Wait, when you draw a line parallel to side AB of triangle T, cutting off a triangle at the top, the remaining figure is a trapezoid. Similarly, doing this for all three sides would result in a hexagon.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths of the sides cut off must all be equal.

Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is equal to the amount by which we've cut off each corner.

Wait, maybe the side length s of the hexagon is the same as the length of the segment cut off from each corner.

Wait, let me try to model this.

Consider triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. Let’s denote the sides as follows: let AB = 200, BC = 300, and AC = 240.

Wait, no, actually in a triangle, the sides are opposite the angles. So, side opposite vertex A is BC = 200, side opposite vertex B is AC = 300, and side opposite vertex C is AB = 240. Wait, no, I think I mixed that up.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. So, the triangle's sides correspond to the extensions of these sides.

Therefore, the triangle's sides are formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, each side of the triangle T is formed by one extended side of the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle T is the sum of two sides of the hexagon plus some overlap? Or maybe each side of T is equal to the side length of the hexagon multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle T is similar to the hexagon's "outer" triangle, with a scaling factor.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, and the triangle T is formed by the extensions of three non-consecutive sides, perhaps the hexagon can be thought of as a combination of three parallelograms and a central triangle.

But that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe using the concept of similar triangles and the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem).

If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet at points forming triangle T. Let’s denote the points where AB, CD, EF meet as P, Q, R, forming triangle PQR with sides 200, 240, 300.

Then, the hexagon is inscribed in triangle PQR such that each pair of opposite sides is parallel to the sides of PQR.

So, for example, AB is parallel to DE, CD is parallel to FA, and EF is parallel to BC.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's AB, CD, EF whose extensions form the triangle. So, maybe the hexagon is between the triangle and the extensions.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is such that each of its sides is a portion of the sides of triangle T, but the sides are extended beyond the hexagon to form the triangle.

Wait, maybe each side of the triangle is the sum of two sides of the hexagon and an extension.

Wait, if I denote the side length of the hexagon as s, then each side of triangle T would be equal to s plus some extension. But since the hexagon has six sides, each side is s, and opposite sides are parallel.

Wait, maybe each side of triangle T is equal to 2s plus something. Wait, no, that might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps each side of triangle T is equal to the side length of the hexagon multiplied by a certain factor depending on the angles.

Wait, perhaps the triangle T is the outer triangle and the hexagon is inside it, such that each side of the hexagon is a portion of each side of T.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, so the portions must be equal.

Wait, perhaps each side of T is divided into three equal parts, each of length s. But the sides of T are 200, 240, 300, which are not multiples of s necessarily.

Wait, 200 is not a multiple of 80, which I thought earlier, but 200/80 = 2.5, which is not an integer.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides, but scaled by a factor.

But since the hexagon is a hexagon, not a triangle, maybe that's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps using barycentric coordinates. But that might be too advanced.

Wait, maybe using the area of triangle T and the area of the hexagon.

But without knowing the area of the hexagon, that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe using the ratio of areas to find the side length.

Wait, but I don't know the area of the hexagon.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, it's a special case known as a "parallelogon," but in two dimensions, the only parallelogons are parallelograms and hexagons with opposite sides equal and parallel.

Wait, but in 2D, a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel is sometimes called a "zonogon," but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon can be considered as a combination of three parallelograms.

Wait, maybe each pair of opposite sides can be considered as the bases of parallelograms, and the hexagon is formed by these.

But I'm not sure how that would help me find the side length.

Wait, perhaps using vector geometry.

Let me consider the hexagon as a closed polygon, with each side a vector of equal length but different directions.

Since opposite sides are parallel, their vectors are scalar multiples of each other. But since the hexagon is equilateral, the vectors have the same magnitude, so the opposite vectors are equal.

Wait, so if AB is a vector v, then DE is also vector v. Similarly, BC is vector w, EF is vector w, and CD is vector u, FA is vector u.

Since the hexagon is closed, the sum of all vectors must be zero.

So, AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 0.

Which becomes v + w + u + v + w + u = 0 → 2v + 2w + 2u = 0 → v + w + u = 0.

So, the sum of vectors v, w, and u is zero.

But each of these vectors has the same magnitude, which is the side length s of the hexagon.

So, |v| = |w| = |u| = s.

And v + w + u = 0.

So, the vectors form a triangle themselves, each of length s.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the vectors v, w, u form a triangle when added tip-to-tail.

So, in that case, the triangle formed by vectors v, w, u has sides of length s, s, s. So, it's an equilateral triangle.

Wait, but that can't be right, because in the problem, the triangle T has sides of different lengths.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The sum of vectors v + w + u is zero, so arranging them tip-to-tail forms a triangle. Since each vector has the same magnitude s, this triangle is equilateral with all sides equal to s.

But in the problem, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300, which is a scalene triangle.

So, how are these two triangles related?

Wait, maybe the triangle T (200,240,300) is similar to the triangle formed by vectors v, w, u, which is equilateral with side s.

But if they are similar, then all sides of T would have to be proportional to s, but T is scalene. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the triangle T is related to the triangle formed by the vectors v, w, u through some scaling factor.

Wait, another thought: The triangle T is the outer triangle, and the triangle formed by vectors v, w, u is the inner triangle, scaled down.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the triangle T is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is formed by three parallelograms attached to the sides of the inner triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle T is the result of extending the sides of the hexagon, so that each side of T is formed by two sides of the hexagon.

Wait, for example, side AB is extended beyond B and beyond A to form part of side T. Similarly for the other sides.

Wait, so each side of triangle T is formed by two extensions of the hexagon's sides.

If that's the case, then each side of T would be equal to twice the side length of the hexagon. But 2s = 200, 2s=240, 2s=300, which is impossible because s can't be 100, 120, and 150 at the same time.

So that can't be.

Wait, maybe each side of T is equal to the side length of the hexagon plus some multiple.

Wait, perhaps each side of T is equal to s times (1 + 2k), where k is some scaling factor due to the extensions.

But again, without knowing k, I can't solve for s.

Wait, maybe I can set up equations based on similar triangles.

Suppose that when I extend AB, CD, and EF to form triangle T, the extensions create similar triangles.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as s.

When I extend AB beyond B and beyond A, the extension beyond B will meet the extension of CD beyond D, and so on, forming triangle T.

Each of these extensions would form similar triangles with the original hexagon.

Wait, perhaps the triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides.

Wait, but the hexagon is a hexagon, not a triangle. So, maybe the triangle T is similar to a triangle formed by connecting every other vertex of the hexagon.

Wait, if I connect every other vertex of the hexagon, would that form a triangle similar to T?

Wait, in a regular hexagon, connecting every other vertex forms an equilateral triangle. But in this case, the hexagon isn't regular, but it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel.

So, perhaps connecting every other vertex forms a triangle similar to T.

Let me think: In a regular hexagon, connecting every other vertex gives an equilateral triangle. But in this case, the triangle T is scalene, so the hexagon isn't regular.

Wait, maybe the triangle formed by connecting every other vertex is similar to T.

So, let's denote that triangle as S, which is similar to T.

If that's the case, then the sides of S are proportional to the sides of T.

But how does that help me find s?

Alternatively, perhaps the side length s of the hexagon relates to the sides of T through the similarity ratio.

Wait, if triangle S is similar to T with a ratio of k, then each side of S is k times the corresponding side of T.

But without knowing k, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is such that s is the geometric mean of the sides of T.

Wait, the geometric mean of 200, 240, 300 is the cube root of (200*240*300).

Compute 200*240 = 48,000; 48,000*300 = 14,400,000.

Cube root of 14,400,000 ≈ 244. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps the side length s is the same for the hexagon, so each side of the triangle S is equal to s*sqrt(3) or something, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of affine transformations.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it's an affine image of a regular hexagon.

An affine transformation preserves ratios and parallelism but not necessarily distances or angles.

So, the triangle T would be the affine image of an equilateral triangle, resulting in a scalene triangle.

In that case, the side length s of the hexagon would be scaled by the affine transformation.

But I don't know enough about affine transformations to apply this directly.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles and set up ratios.

Suppose that when I extend AB, CD, and EF, the triangle formed has sides proportional to the sides of the hexagon.

Wait, if the triangle T has sides a, b, c (200, 240, 300), and the hexagon has side length s, then perhaps the ratio of a/s, b/s, c/s are the same.

But since a, b, c are different, the ratios would be different, so that can't hold.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the centers of the hexagon's sides.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals, as I thought earlier.

So, 1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300.

Calculating that gives:

1/200 = 0.005

1/240 ≈ 0.00416667

1/300 ≈ 0.00333333

Adding them: 0.005 + 0.00416667 + 0.00333333 ≈ 0.0125

So, 1/s ≈ 0.0125 → s ≈ 80.

So, s = 80.

But I need to verify if this makes sense.

If the side length is 80, then each side of the triangle T is formed by extending the hexagon's sides, which are 80 each.

But how exactly?

Wait, perhaps each side of T is equal to the side length of the hexagon times (1 + 1/2 + 1/3) or something like that. But 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 11/6 ≈ 1.833, which would make 80 * 1.833 ≈ 146.666, which isn't matching the triangle sides.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the sides of T are proportional to the side length s multiplied by some function of the angles.

But without knowing the angles, that's difficult.

Wait, perhaps using mass point geometry or area ratios.

Wait, another thought: The triangle T can be divided into smaller triangles, each similar to T, and the hexagon is formed by the overlapping regions.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of similar triangles and the intercept theorem.

If I can find the ratio of the sides of the hexagon to the sides of T, I can find s.

But I need more information.

Wait, going back to the vector approach, since the sum of vectors v + w + u = 0, and each has magnitude s, forming an equilateral triangle.

But the triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300.

Wait, perhaps the triangle formed by vectors v, w, u is similar to triangle T.

But triangle T is scalene, and the triangle formed by v, w, u is equilateral, so they can't be similar unless T is also equilateral, which it isn't.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the triangle formed by vectors v, w, u is similar to the triangle T but scaled.

But since T is scalene and the triangle formed by the vectors is equilateral, that's impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the triangle formed by the vectors is not directly similar but related through another transformation.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the hexagon as a combination of three parallelograms, each pair of opposite sides forming a parallelogram.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each pair of opposite sides forms a parallelogram with sides of length s and some other length, say, t.

But without knowing t, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the triangle T is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is formed by cutting off three smaller triangles from T, each with side length s.

So, each side of T is reduced by 2s (s from each end), but since the sides of T are different, the remaining lengths after cutting off s from each end would have to be equal.

Wait, that would require that 200 - 2s = 240 - 2s = 300 - 2s, which is impossible because 200, 240, 300 are different.

So that can't be.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, the distance between each pair of opposite sides is the same.

Wait, in a regular hexagon, the distance between opposite sides is 2 * (s * sqrt(3)/2) = s*sqrt(3). But in this case, the hexagon isn't regular.

But perhaps the distances between opposite sides relate to the sides of triangle T.

Wait, but triangle T is formed by the extensions, so perhaps the distances between the opposite sides of the hexagon are proportional to the heights of triangle T.

Wait, let me compute the area of triangle T using Heron's formula.

The sides are 200, 240, 300.

Compute semi-perimeter: (200 + 240 + 300)/2 = 740/2 = 370.

Area = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = sqrt[370*(370-200)*(370-240)*(370-300)] = sqrt[370*170*130*70].

Compute this:

370 = 37 * 10

170 = 17 * 10

130 = 13 * 10

70 = 7 * 10

So, sqrt[(37*10)*(17*10)*(13*10)*(7*10)] = sqrt[(37*17*13*7)*(10^4)].

Compute 37*17=629, 13*7=91. So 629*91.

Compute 629 *91:

629 *90=56,610

629 *1=629

Total=56,610 + 629=57,239.

So, sqrt[57,239 * 10^4] = sqrt[57,239] * 100.

Earlier, I found that sqrt(57,239) ≈ 239.247.

So, area ≈ 239.247 * 100 = 23,924.7.

So, area of triangle T is approximately 23,924.7.

Now, if the hexagon is inside T, perhaps the area of the hexagon relates to the area of T.

But without knowing the exact relationship, this might not help.

Wait, another thought: If I can find the ratio of areas between the hexagon and triangle T, I can find s.

But I don't know the area of the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon divides the triangle T into smaller similar triangles.

Wait, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps the triangle formed by the vectors v, w, u (each of length s) has area equal to the area of the hexagon.

But I don't know the area of the hexagon.

Wait, maybe using the formula for the area of a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel.

I don't recall a specific formula, but perhaps it can be expressed in terms of the triangle T.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, the lines AB, CD, EF form a triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300.

Each side of T is the result of extending two sides of the hexagon.

So, for example, side AB is extended beyond B and beyond A to form part of side T.

Similarly for CD and EF.

So, each side of T is formed by two extensions of the hexagon's sides.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the extensions beyond each vertex are equal.

Wait, perhaps each extension is equal to a certain multiple of the hexagon's side length.

Wait, so if I denote the extension beyond each vertex as t, then each side of T would be equal to s + 2t.

Wait, but the sides of T are 200, 240, 300. So, s + 2t = 200, s + 2t = 240, s + 2t = 300. Which is impossible because s + 2t can't be three different numbers.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the extensions on each side are different.

Wait, let me denote that the extension beyond AB is t1, beyond BC is t2, beyond CD is t3, etc.

But this would complicate things with too many variables.

Wait, another thought: Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the extensions on each side must be equal.

Wait, perhaps each side of T is equal to s + 2t, where t is the extension on each end.

But as before, this leads to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps instead of adding s on both ends, the side of T is equal to s multiplied by some factor.

Wait, maybe each side of T is twice the side length of the hexagon, but as before, that's impossible since T has sides of different lengths.

Wait, unless the hexagon's sides are arranged in a way that each side of T corresponds to two sides of the hexagon.

But no, the hexagon has six sides, so each side of T would correspond to two sides of the hexagon.

Wait, maybe each side of T is equal to the sum of two sides of the hexagon.

But if each side of the hexagon is s, then each side of T would be 2s.

But again, T has sides of different lengths, so 2s can't equal 200, 240, and 300.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe each side of T is equal to the sum of three sides of the hexagon.

But 3s would have to equal 200, 240, 300, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the side length s relates to the sides of T through the formula involving the sum of the sides.

Wait, if I add the sides of T: 200 + 240 + 300 = 740.

If I divide this by 9, I get approximately 82.22, which is close to 80 but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe s is 740 divided by something, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the side length of a hexagon inscribed in a triangle.

I found a formula online once, but I can't recall it exactly. Maybe it's something like s = (a*b*c)/(a*b + b*c + c*a).

Let me compute that.

Given a = 200, b=240, c=300.

s = (200*240*300)/(200*240 + 240*300 + 300*200)

Compute numerator: 200*240=48,000; 48,000*300=14,400,000.

Denominator: 200*240=48,000; 240*300=72,000; 300*200=60,000. Sum: 48,000 +72,000=120,000 +60,000=180,000.

So, s = 14,400,000 / 180,000 = 80.

So, s = 80.

Wait, that seems consistent with the earlier result where 1/s = sum of reciprocals.

So, according to this formula, the side length is 80.

Hmm, that's promising.

Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 80.


To solve the problem, we consider a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel. The triangle formed by extending sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We aim to find the side length of the hexagon.

1. **Understanding the Hexagon and Triangle Relationship**:
   - The hexagon is equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal.
   - Opposite sides are parallel, implying the hexagon has a symmetrical structure.
   - Extending sides AB, CD, and EF forms a triangle T with sides 200, 240, and 300.

2. **Using the Formula for the Side Length**:
   - The side length \( s \) of the hexagon can be found using the formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{a \cdot b \cdot c}{a \cdot b + b \cdot c + c \cdot a}
     \]
     where \( a = 200 \), \( b = 240 \), and \( c = 300 \).

3. **Calculations**:
   - Compute the numerator:
     \[
     200 \cdot 240 = 48,000
     \]
     \[
     48,000 \cdot 300 = 14,400,000
     \]
   - Compute the denominator:
     \[
     200 \cdot 240 = 48,000
     \]
     \[
     240 \cdot 300 = 72,000
     \]
     \[
     300 \cdot 200 = 60,000
     \]
     \[
     48,000 + 72,000 + 60,000 = 180,000
     \]
   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:
     \[
     s = \frac{14,400,000}{180,000} = 80
     \]

Thus, the side length of the hexagon is \(\boxed{80}\).
