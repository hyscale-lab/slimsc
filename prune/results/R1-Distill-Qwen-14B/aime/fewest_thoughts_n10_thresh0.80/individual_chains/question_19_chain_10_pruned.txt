Okay, I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. So, let me jot down what I know.

First, some properties:

- The circumradius (R) is 13. So, all the vertices A, B, C lie on a circle with radius 13 centered at O.
- The inradius (r) is 6. The inradius is the radius of the incircle, which touches all three sides of the triangle.
- IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, meaning their dot product is zero.

Let me recall some formulas that might be useful here.

1. The distance between the incenter and circumcenter: There's a formula called the formula of Euler which states that the distance between O and I is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me check that.

Wait, yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry says that OI^2 = R(R - 2r). So, OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me compute that with R=13 and r=6.

OI^2 = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, that's interesting. So, OI is sqrt(13). But IA is perpendicular to OI, which is a line segment from I to A. So, IA is perpendicular to OI.

Hmm, how can I use that? Maybe coordinate geometry? Or perhaps using vectors? Alternatively, maybe trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the length of IA. I remember that the length of the inradius can be related to the sides, but IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A.

Wait, yes, the formula for IA is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2) and IC = r / sin(C/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.

Let me place point O at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is a vector from O to I, which is a point somewhere in the plane. Hmm, but maybe it's better to place point I somewhere along an axis to simplify things.

Wait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI. So, if I can represent these vectors in coordinates, their dot product should be zero.

Let me denote the coordinates of I as (h, k). Then, vector OI is (h, k). Vector IA is (Ax - h, Ay - k), where A is (Ax, Ay).

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero:

(Ax - h)*h + (Ay - k)*k = 0.

Hmm, but I don't know the coordinates of A yet. Maybe this approach is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the position of I relative to O. Since O is the circumcenter, and I is the incenter, their positions are related. Euler's line connects O, I, and the centroid, but in this case, I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, but we know OI = sqrt(13). So, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Also, IA is perpendicular to OI.

Let me think in terms of vectors. Let me denote vector OI as vector v, and vector IA as vector w. Then, since they are perpendicular, v · w = 0.

But vector IA is equal to vector OA - vector OI, right? Because IA is from I to A, and OA is from O to A, so OA = OI + IA. Therefore, IA = OA - OI.

So, vector IA = vector OA - vector OI.

Given that, their dot product is zero:

(OA - OI) · OI = 0.

Which implies OA · OI - |OI|^2 = 0.

So, OA · OI = |OI|^2.

But OA is a vector from O to A. Since O is the circumcenter, |OA| = R = 13.

Let me denote vector OA as **a**, and vector OI as **v**. Then, **a** · **v** = |v|².

But |v| = sqrt(13), so |v|² = 13.

So, **a** · **v** = 13.

Also, since **a** is a vector of length 13, and **v** is a vector of length sqrt(13), the dot product can be expressed as |a||v|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them.

So, 13 = 13 * sqrt(13) * cosθ.

Divide both sides by 13: 1 = sqrt(13) * cosθ.

So, cosθ = 1/sqrt(13).

Therefore, the angle between OA and OI is arccos(1/sqrt(13)).

Hmm, that's an angle of approximately 70 degrees or so, but maybe I don't need the exact value.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the cosine law in triangle OIA.

Wait, triangle OIA: we have OA = 13, OI = sqrt(13), and IA = ?

Wait, I can write the cosine law for triangle OIA:

IA² = OA² + OI² - 2*OA*OI*cosθ.

But we know OA, OI, and θ is the angle between OA and OI, which we found that cosθ = 1/sqrt(13).

Wait, let me compute IA:

IA² = 13² + (sqrt(13))² - 2*13*sqrt(13)*(1/sqrt(13)).

Compute each term:

13² = 169.

(sqrt(13))² = 13.

The third term: 2*13*sqrt(13)*(1/sqrt(13)) = 2*13*(sqrt(13)/sqrt(13)) = 2*13*1 = 26.

So, IA² = 169 + 13 - 26 = 169 +13 is 182, minus 26 is 156. So, IA² = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). But earlier, I thought IA is equal to r / sin(A/2). Let me check that.

Yes, the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore,

6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39)
=> sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, 3/sqrt(39) simplifies to sqrt(39)/13? Let me see:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(39):

3*sqrt(39) / (sqrt(39)*sqrt(39)) = 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13.

Yes, correct.

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Hmm, I can use this to find cos(A/2) because sin² + cos² =1.
