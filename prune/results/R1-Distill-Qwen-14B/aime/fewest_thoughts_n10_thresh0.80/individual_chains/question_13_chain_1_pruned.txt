Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to find.

First, the problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. So, her walk is 9 kilometers each time.

When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the total time she takes is 4 hours. This time includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals 4 hours.

Then, when she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the total time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, which still includes the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. I need to find the time her walk takes when she walks at 's + Â½' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, I think I can set up two equations based on the information given. Since the distance is the same, 9 km, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

But wait, the time here includes both walking and the coffee shop time. So, the total time is the walking time plus the coffee time 't' (in hours, since speed is in km per hour).

Let me convert the times into hours to keep the units consistent.

In the first scenario:
- Walking speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours = 4 hours (already in hours)
- So, walking time + t (in hours) = 4 hours.

Similarly, in the second scenario:
- Walking speed: (s + 2) km/h
- Total time: 2 hours and 24 minutes. Since 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.
- So, walking time + t = 2.4 hours.

So, let me write the equations.

First scenario:
Walking time = 9 / s hours
Total time: (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4

Wait, no. Wait, I think I messed up the units for 't'. Because 't' is given in minutes, but the walking time is in hours. So, to add them together, I should convert 't' into hours.

So, 't' minutes is equal to t/60 hours.

So, correct equations:

First scenario:
(9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4

Second scenario:
(9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

So, now I have two equations:

1) (9/s) + (t/60) = 4
2) (9/(s+2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

Let me write these equations more clearly:

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4
Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Since both equations have t/60, maybe I can subtract one equation from the other
