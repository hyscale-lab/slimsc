Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she increases her speed to s + 2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, the question is, if Aya walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, how many minutes will the walk take her, including the t minutes at the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to find out how long the walk itself takes at different speeds, and then figure out what t is. Once I have both s and t, I can compute the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me think. So, the walk is 9 kilometers each time. The time taken includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. So, the total time is the sum of the time spent walking and the time spent at the coffee shop.

Wait, so when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. Similarly, when she walks at s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes.

So, if I denote T1 as the time she takes walking at speed s, and T2 as the time she takes walking at speed s+2, then the total time is T1 + t = 4 hours, and T2 + t = 2 hours and 24 minutes.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the total time given (4 hours and 2 hours 24 minutes) includes t. So, the walking time plus t equals the total time.

So, let me parse this again.

At speed s: walking time is 9/s hours, and the total time including t is 4 hours.

At speed s+2: walking time is 9/(s+2) hours, and the total time including t is 2 hours 24 minutes.

Wait, but the 4 hours and 2h24m include t, the coffee shop time. So, the walking time plus t equals the total time.

So, if I can express the walking time in terms of s, then I can set up equations to solve for s and t.

Let me write down these equations.

First, when walking at speed s:
Walking time = 9 / s hours
Total time = 4 hours = walking time + t
But t is in minutes, so I need to convert it to hours or vice versa.

Let me convert everything to hours for consistency. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, equation 1:
9/s + t/60 = 4

Similarly, for the second scenario, walking at speed s + 2:
Walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes
