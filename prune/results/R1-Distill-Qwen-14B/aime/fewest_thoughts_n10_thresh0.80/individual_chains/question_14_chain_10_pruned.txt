Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with a specific property: changing any one of its digits to 1 makes the number divisible by 7.

Wait, so N is a four-digit number, let's say N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. Then, if I change any one digit (A, B, C, or D) to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N. Then, when we divide N by 1000, we get Q as the quotient (which would be the first digit A) and R as the remainder (which is the last three digits, BCD). Then, we need to compute Q + R.

So, first, I need to find N. Let's break down the problem.

Let me think about the conditions. For N to satisfy that when any one digit is changed to 1, the result is divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1: 1BCD is divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1: A1CD is divisible by 7. Same for changing C to 1: AB1D, and changing D to 1: ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, if I can model this, maybe I can find what N must be.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is not zero because it's a four-digit number.

Now, changing each digit to 1 gives us four new numbers:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these must be divisible by 7. So, each of these four numbers modulo 7 must be 0.

Therefore, for each case, the number modulo 7 is 0. Let me write equations for each.

Case 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
Case 2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
Case 3: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
Case 4: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, four congruences.

But wait, N itself, which is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, is the original number. Let's denote N as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

So, the four cases can be written as:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, perhaps I can express each of these in terms of N. Let's see.

Case 1: (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) = 1000 + (100b + 10c + d) = 1000 + (N - 1000a). Because N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, so N - 1000a = 100b + 10c + d. So, Case 1 becomes:

1000 + (N - 1000a) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which can be rewritten as:

1000 + N - 1000a ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, I can do this for all cases.

Case 2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + (10c + d) = 1000a + 100 + (N - 1000a - 100b). Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each case in terms of N and some delta.

Alternatively, perhaps
