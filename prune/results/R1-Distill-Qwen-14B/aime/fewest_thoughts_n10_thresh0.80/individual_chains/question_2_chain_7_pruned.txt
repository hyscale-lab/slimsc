Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have three points: O at (0,0), which is the origin; A at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1, 0); and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere on the y-axis. So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis.

Then, there's a family of segments PQ, each of unit length (so length 1), lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and each Q is on the y-axis. So, for each PQ in this family, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p and q positive real numbers because we're in the first quadrant. And the distance between P and Q is 1, so sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1.

So, the family F consists of all such PQ segments. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p and q positive, and sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, the equation p² + q² = 1 holds for each segment.

Now, we have the line segment AB. Let me find the coordinates of A and B. A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, to find the equation of line AB, I can use the two-point form.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form, let's use point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, that's the equation of AB.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, C is a point on AB such that it's not on any other PQ in family F except for AB itself.

We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express OC² as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.

So, the strategy might be:

1. Find the equation of line AB.
2. For a general segment PQ in F, find the condition that point C lies on PQ. But since C is only on AB and no other PQ, we need to find C such that it's the only intersection point between AB and all possible PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize point C on AB and then find the condition that C doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB.

Let me try parametrizing AB.

Since AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), I can write any point C on AB as a linear combination:

C = (1/2)(1 - t) + 0*t, 0*(1 - t) + (sqrt(3)/2)*t ) = ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ), where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, it's A; t=1, it's B.

So, C can be written as ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ). So, coordinates of C are ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) for some t in (0,1).

Now, we want that for C, there is no other PQ in F (except AB itself) that contains C. So, for any other PQ with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis, with PQ of length 1, C shouldn't lie on PQ.

So, to find such a C, perhaps we can find for which t, the point C is only on AB and not on any other PQ in F.

So, suppose that for some t, C is on AB and also on some other PQ. Then, we need to find t such that C is not on any other PQ except AB.

Wait, but since AB is itself a segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is part of F, because its length is 1.

Wait, is AB in F? Let me check.

AB has P at (1/2,0) and Q at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance between these two points is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, yes, AB is indeed in F. So, AB is one of the segments in F.

So, the point C is on AB, but it shouldn't be on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, for point
