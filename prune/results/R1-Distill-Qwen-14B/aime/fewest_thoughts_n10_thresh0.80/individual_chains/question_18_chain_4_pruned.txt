Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by connecting non-adjacent vertices. But a dodecagon has 12 sides, which is a lot. I need to figure out a systematic way to count all possible rectangles.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 vertices, each spaced 30 degrees apart because 360/12 = 30. Each vertex is connected to other vertices by sides or diagonals. For a rectangle to exist, I think we need four vertices that form right angles. So, the sides of the rectangle must be either sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals, but I'm not entirely sure how the diagonals work here.

Wait, in a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides are all the same length, but diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal connecting two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that skips more vertices.

But wait, in order for four sides to form a rectangle, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the angles must be 90 degrees. So, in the dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must be either sides of the polygon or certain diagonals that are perpendicular to each other.

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the properties of a regular dodecagon in terms of coordinates. If I place the dodecagon on a unit circle centered at the origin, each vertex can be represented by a point (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is 30° times the vertex number. So, vertex 0 is at (1,0), vertex 1 at (cos 30°, sin 30°), and so on, up to vertex 11.

If I can find four such points that form a rectangle, that would solve the problem. Now, how do four points form a rectangle? The necessary and sufficient condition is that the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, and the distance between the midpoints is equal, but wait, that might not directly apply here. Alternatively, for a rectangle, the vectors representing the sides should be perpendicular.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by pairs of diameters that are perpendicular. Wait, that might be a way. Because in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, you can draw diameters connecting opposite vertices, and these diameters are perpendicular in some cases.

Wait, but in a dodecagon, the diameters are every 6 steps. So, connecting vertex 0 to 6, 1 to 7, etc. These diameters are all straight lines through the center. Now, if two diameters are perpendicular, then the quadrilateral formed by their endpoints is a rectangle. But wait, that might not always be the case.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, the angle between adjacent diameters is 30°, because each vertex is 30° apart. So, to have two diameters perpendicular, the angle between them should be 90°, which is 3 steps apart (since 3*30=90). So, if I pick a diameter, say, from vertex 0 to 6, then another diameter that's perpendicular to it would be 3 steps away. So, from vertex 3 to 9, because 0 to 3 is 90°, right?

Wait, but diameters are straight lines through the center, so if I pick diameters at 0-6 and 3-9, those are perpendicular. Then the four points would be 0, 3, 6,
