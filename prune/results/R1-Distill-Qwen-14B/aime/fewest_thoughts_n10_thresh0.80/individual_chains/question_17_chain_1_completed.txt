Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

Let B be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let r be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B. The value of r squared can be written as a fraction p/q, where p and q are relatively prime positive integers. I need to find p + q.

Hmm. So, the problem is about finding the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, find r squared as a reduced fraction and add the numerator and denominator.

First, let me recall that a rectangular box has length, width, and height, which I can denote as x, y, z. So, the surface area S of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz). The volume V is xyz.

Given that S = 54 and V = 23, so:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 => xy + yz + xz = 27.

And xyz = 23.

We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must enclose the box, so the radius of the sphere must be at least half the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere's diameter has to be at least as long as the diagonal of the box for it to contain the box.

So, the space diagonal d of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2, so r² is (d²)/4.

Thus, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, we need to find the minimal possible value of (x² + y² + z²) over all boxes with the given surface area and volume, then divide by 4 to get r².

Wait, no. Because the sphere has to contain any such box, so the minimal sphere that can contain all boxes in B would have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B, divided by 2. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, the sphere must contain each box, but the size of the sphere must be such that it can contain any box from B. So, the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2. So, to find the minimal sphere that can contain all such boxes, we have to find the maximum value of the space diagonal over all boxes in B, and then set r to be that maximum divided by 2.

So, our goal is to maximize x² + y² + z² given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.

So, we need to maximize x² + y² + z² with these constraints.

Let me think about how to approach this. It's an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? Or perhaps using inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

I remember that for three variables, (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, from that, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz). We know that xy + yz + xz = 27, which is given.

So, substituting that in, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, if we can find x + y + z, then we can compute x² + y² + z². But I don't know x + y + z yet, so maybe we need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use AM ≥ GM or other inequalities to relate x, y, z.

But since the problem involves both the surface area and the volume, which are given, perhaps we can parameterize the variables in some way.

Let me try to denote x, y, z as the sides. Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps the maximum of x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal? Or maybe when all three are equal? Hmm.

Wait, if all three are equal, that would be a cube. But in a cube, surface area and volume would satisfy certain conditions.

Let me check: for a cube, surface area is 6x², and volume is x³. But in our case, surface area is 54, which would be 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. Then volume would be 3³ = 27. But in our case, volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box is not a cube.

Therefore, the variables x, y, z are not all equal. So, perhaps the maximum x² + y² + z² occurs when one of them is as large as possible, and the others as small as possible, given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Alternatively, maybe when two sides are equal, and the third is different. Let me assume, without loss of generality, that x = y, and see what happens.

So, let me let x = y, then we have:

Surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 2(x² + 2xz) = 2x² + 4xz = 54.

Divide both sides by 2: x² + 2xz = 27.

Volume: x * x * z = x² z = 23.

So, from the volume equation, z = 23 / x².

Substitute into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27.

Simplify:

x² + (46)/x = 27.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator (assuming x ≠ 0):

x³ + 46 = 27x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ - 27x + 46 = 0.

Hmm, so we have a cubic equation: x³ -27x +46 = 0.

Let me try to find real roots for this equation. Maybe rational roots. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0.

x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor this as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) =0.

So, the other roots are solutions to x² + 2x -23 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive (it's a length), so x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈3.898, or x= -1 - 2√6, which is negative, so discard.

So, the roots are x=2 and x= -1 + 2√6.

So, possible solutions are when x=2 and x= -1 + 2√6.

So, when x=2, then z=23/x²=23/4=5.75.

So, sides are x=y=2, z=5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z²: 2² + 2² + (5.75)^2 =4 +4 + 33.0625=41.0625= 41 + 1/16= 657/16.

Alternatively, 41.0625 is 657/16.

Alternatively, when x= -1 + 2√6, which is approximately 3.898, let's compute z.

z=23/x². Let me compute x² first.

x= -1 + 2√6 => x +1 = 2√6 => (x+1)^2=24 => x² + 2x +1=24 =>x²=23 -2x.

So, x²=23 -2x.

So, z=23/(23 -2x).

But x= -1 + 2√6, so substituting:

z=23/(23 -2*(-1 + 2√6))=23/(23 +2 -4√6)=23/(25 -4√6).

Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529=1/23.

So, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, now, compute x² + y² + z².

Since x=y, we have 2x² + z².

We know that x²=23 -2x, from earlier.

So:

x² + y² + z² = 2x² + z² =2*(23 -2x) + z²=46 -4x + z².

But z²=(25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2.

Wait, z= (25 +4√6)/23, so z²=(25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2.

Compute numerator: (25)^2 + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2=625 + 200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, z²=(721 +200√6)/(529).

So, putting it all together:

x² + y² + z²=46 -4x + (721 +200√6)/529.

But x= -1 +2√6, so:

x= -1 +2√6.

So, -4x=4 -8√6.

So, x² + y² + z²=46 +4 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Compute 46 +4=50.

So, 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me write this as:

50 -8√6 + (721)/529 + (200√6)/529.

Now, compute each term as fractions:

50 can be written as 50*(529/529)=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6 = (-8√6)*(529/529)= (-4232√6)/529.

721 is already over 529.

200√6 is (200√6)/529.

So, adding them all together:

26450/529 + (-4232√6)/529 +721/529 +200√6/529.

Combine like terms:

Numerator constants: 26450 +721=27171.

Numerator √6 terms: (-4232 +200)√6= (-4032)√6.

So, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hmm, that's a bit messy. So, comparing the two cases when x=2 and x= -1 +2√6, we have:

Case 1: x=2, x² + y² + z²=657/16≈41.0625.

Case 2: x= -1 +2√6, x² + y² + z²≈(27171 -4032√6)/529≈ let me compute numerically.

Compute 27171 ≈27171.

Compute 4032√6≈4032*2.449≈4032*2.449≈ let's compute 4000*2.449=9796, 32*2.449≈78.368, total≈9796 +78.368≈9874.368.

So, numerator≈27171 -9874.368≈17296.632.

Then, 17296.632 /529≈17296.632 /529≈32.73.

So, x² + y² + z²≈32.73.

Which is less than 41.06. So, in this case, when x=2, the sum is larger.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs when x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

But wait, maybe I should check if this is indeed the maximum or if other configurations could lead to a larger sum.

Wait, when I fixed x=y, I got two possible values for x. One gave a larger x² + y² + z², and the other gave a smaller. So, in this case, the maximum is 657/16≈41.0625.

But is that the global maximum? Or could it be higher when x, y, z are all different?

Hmm. Maybe, but it's difficult to analyze. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, as in the case above.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the optimization problem.

We need to maximize f(x, y, z)=x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z)=xy + yz + xz=27,

h(x, y, z)=xyz=23.

So, using Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the system:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

Compute gradients:

∇f=(2x, 2y, 2z).

∇g=(y + z, x + z, x + y).

∇h=(yz, xz, xy).

So, equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz),

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz),

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy).

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz=27,

xyz=23.

So, now, we have five equations with five variables (x, y, z, λ, μ).

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find symmetry or assume some variables are equal.

Let's assume that two variables are equal, say x=y. Then, the equations may simplify.

So, let x=y.

Then, from the first two equations:

2x = λ(x + z) + μ(x z),

2x = λ(x + z) + μ(x z).

So, the first two equations are identical, which is consistent.

The third equation becomes:

2z = λ(2x) + μ(x²).

So, 2z = 2λ x + μ x².

Now, let me write down the equations:

From the first equation:

2x = λ(x + z) + μ x z.

From the third equation:

2z = 2 λ x + μ x².

And the constraints:

x² + 2 x z =27,

x² z =23.

So, let me use the constraints to express z in terms of x.

From x² z=23, z=23/(x²).

Substitute into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²)=27 =>x² +46/x=27.

Which is the same equation as before, leading to x³ -27x +46=0, which we solved earlier, giving x=2 and x= -1 +2√6.

So, in this case, x=2 or x≈3.898.

Now, let's plug back into the Lagrangian equations.

Case 1: x=2, so z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, x=y=2, z=5.75.

Now, compute λ and μ.

From the first equation:

2x = λ(x + z) + μ x z.

Substitute x=2, z=5.75:

2*2 = λ(2 +5.75) + μ*2*5.75.

4 = λ(7.75) + μ*11.5.

So, equation (A): 7.75 λ + 11.5 μ =4.

From the third equation:

2z=2λ x + μ x².

Substitute z=5.75, x=2:

2*5.75=2λ*2 + μ*4.

11.5=4λ +4μ.

Equation (B):4λ +4μ=11.5.

So, we have:

Equation A: 7.75 λ + 11.5 μ =4.

Equation B:4λ +4μ=11.5.

Let me write these as fractions to make calculation easier.

Equation A:

7.75=31/4, 11.5=23/2, 4=4/1.

So: (31/4)λ + (23/2)μ =4.

Equation B:

4λ +4μ=11.5=23/2.

So, equation B: 4λ +4μ=23/2.

Let me solve equation B for one variable.

Equation B: 4λ +4μ=23/2.

Divide both sides by 4: λ + μ=23/8.

So, μ=23/8 - λ.

Substitute into equation A:

(31/4)λ + (23/2)(23/8 - λ)=4.

Compute term by term:

(31/4)λ + (23/2)*(23/8) - (23/2)λ =4.

Compute (23/2)*(23/8)= (529)/16.

So:

(31/4)λ - (23/2)λ +529/16=4.

Convert to common denominator, which is 16.

(124/16)λ - (184/16)λ +529/16=4.

Combine λ terms:

(124 -184)/16 λ +529/16=4 => (-60/16)λ +529/16=4.

Simplify:

(-15/4)λ +529/16=4.

Subtract 529/16 from both sides:

-15/4 λ=4 -529/16.

Convert 4 to 64/16.

So, -15/4 λ=64/16 -529/16= (64 -529)/16= (-465)/16.

Multiply both sides by (-4/15):

λ= (-465/16)*(-4/15)= (465*4)/(16*15).

Simplify:

465/15=31, 4/16=1/4.

So, 31*1/4=31/4.

So, λ=31/4.

Then, μ=23/8 -31/4=23/8 -62/8= (-39)/8.

So, μ= -39/8.

So, in this case, we have a valid solution with x=y=2, z=5.75, and λ=31/4, μ= -39/8.

Now, check if this is a maximum or not.

Alternatively, let's look at the other case when x= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, x= -1 +2√6, z=23/(x²)=23/(23 -2x)=23/(23 -2*(-1 +2√6))=23/(23 +2 -4√6)=23/(25 -4√6).

As we computed earlier, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, x≈3.898, z≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

So, x≈3.898, y=x≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Now, plug into the Lagrangian equations.

First equation: 2x=λ(x + z) + μ x z.

Second equation: same as first.

Third equation:2z=2λ x + μ x².

So, let's compute.

Compute x + z=3.898 +1.513≈5.411.

x z≈3.898 *1.513≈5.893.

So, equation A:2*3.898=λ*5.411 + μ*5.893.

Which is≈7.796≈5.411 λ +5.893 μ.

Equation B: 2z≈2*1.513≈3.026=2λ*3.898 + μ*(3.898)^2.

Compute 2λ*3.898≈7.796 λ.

(3.898)^2≈15.193.

So, equation B:3.026=7.796 λ +15.193 μ.

So, now, we have:

Equation A:5.411 λ +5.893 μ≈7.796.

Equation B:7.796 λ +15.193 μ≈3.026.

Let me write these as:

5.411 λ +5.893 μ =7.796.

7.796 λ +15.193 μ =3.026.

Let me solve these equations.

Let me denote the equations:

(1) 5.411 λ +5.893 μ =7.796.

(2)7.796 λ +15.193 μ =3.026.

Let me solve equation (1) for μ:

μ=(7.796 -5.411 λ)/5.893.

Substitute into equation (2):

7.796 λ +15.193*(7.796 -5.411 λ)/5.893=3.026.

Compute denominator 5.893≈5.893.

Compute numerator:

15.193*(7.796 -5.411 λ)=15.193*7.796 -15.193*5.411 λ≈15.193*7.796≈119.073, and 15.193*5.411≈82.000.

So, approximately:

7.796 λ + (119.073 -82.000 λ)/5.893≈3.026.

Multiply both sides by 5.893 to eliminate denominator:

7.796*5.893 λ +119.073 -82.000 λ≈3.026*5.893.

Compute each term:

7.796*5.893≈45.97 λ.

-82.000 λ.

So, (45.97 λ -82.000 λ)= -36.03 λ.

3.026*5.893≈17.85.

So, equation becomes:

-36.03 λ +119.073≈17.85.

Subtract 119.073:

-36.03 λ≈17.85 -119.073≈-101.223.

So, λ≈(-101.223)/(-36.03)≈2.809.

Then, μ=(7.796 -5.411*2.809)/5.893.

Compute 5.411*2.809≈15.213.

So, 7.796 -15.213≈-7.417.

Then, μ≈-7.417 /5.893≈-1.259.

So, λ≈2.809, μ≈-1.259.

So, this gives another critical point. Now, the question is whether this is a maximum or a minimum.

Wait, but in terms of x² + y² + z², in the first case, when x=2, the sum is approximately 41.06, and in the second case, when x≈3.898, the sum is approximately 32.73.

So, in the first case, the sum is higher. So, perhaps the maximum occurs at x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

But to confirm, perhaps we can consider the other case where all three variables are different.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, as in the case above.

Alternatively, perhaps it's possible that the maximum is achieved when two variables are equal, as we saw.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two as small as possible. But given the constraints, perhaps that's not possible because if one variable is very large, the volume would require the other variables to be small, but the surface area would be constrained.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of symmetric variables. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Since we have to maximize x² + y² + z² given that xy + yz + xz=27 and xyz=23.

Let me let S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz=27, and Q=xyz=23.

We know that x, y, z are roots of the cubic equation t³ - S t² + P t - Q=0 => t³ - S t² +27 t -23=0.

Now, x² + y² + z²= S² - 2P= S² -54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize S².

So, we need to find the maximum possible value of S, given that x, y, z are positive real numbers satisfying the constraints.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing S =x + y + z.

Given that xyz=23 and xy + yz + xz=27.

Hmm, so perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but this time trying to maximize S.

Wait, but maybe we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality for three variables.

But AM ≥ GM says that (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3).

So, S/3 ≥ (23)^(1/3). So, S ≥ 3*(23)^(1/3).

Compute 23^(1/3)≈2.843, so S≥8.529.

But that's a lower bound, not an upper bound. So, not helpful for finding the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the inequality that relates S, P, Q.

Wait, for fixed P and Q, how does S vary?

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize two variables and express the third in terms.

Let me fix x and y, then z=23/(x y).

Then, the surface area equation:

xy + y z + x z=27.

Substitute z=23/(x y):

xy + y*(23/(x y)) +x*(23/(x y))=27.

Simplify:

xy +23/x +23/y=27.

Let me denote u = x + y, v=xy.

So, the equation becomes v +23/x +23/y=27.

But 23/x +23/y=23*(x + y)/(x y)=23 u /v.

So, equation: v +23 u /v=27.

Multiply both sides by v:

v² +23 u=27 v.

But u =x + y, and v=xy.

We also have that S =x + y + z= u + z= u +23/(v).

So, S= u +23/v.

Our goal is to maximize S= u +23/v, subject to v² +23 u=27 v.

From the equation v² +23 u=27 v, express u:

23 u=27 v -v² => u=(27 v -v²)/23.

Substitute into S:

S=(27 v -v²)/23 +23/v.

So, S(v)= (27v -v²)/23 +23/v.

We need to maximize S(v) over positive real numbers v.

So, treat S(v) as a function of v, find its maximum.

Compute derivative S’(v):

S’(v)= [27 -2v]/23 -23 /v².

Set S’(v)=0:

[27 -2v]/23 -23/v²=0.

Multiply both sides by 23 v² to eliminate denominators:

(27 -2v) v² - (23)^2=0.

Compute:

27 v² -2 v^3 -529=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 v^3 -27 v² +529=0.

So, 2v³ -27v² +529=0.

This is a cubic equation in v.

Let me try to find rational roots.

Possible rational roots: factors of 529 over factors of 2. 529=23², so possible roots: ±1, ±23, ±529, ±1/2, ±23/2, ±529/2.

Testing v=23: 2*(23)^3 -27*(23)^2 +529=2*12167 -27*529 +529=24334 -14283 +529=24334-14283=10051 +529=10580≠0.

v=23/2: 2*(23/2)^3 -27*(23/2)^2 +529.

Compute (23/2)^3= (12167)/8, (23/2)^2=529/4.

So, 2*(12167/8)=12167/4, 27*(529/4)=14283/4.

So:

12167/4 -14283/4 +529= (12167 -14283)/4 +529= (-2116)/4 +529= -529 +529=0.

So, v=23/2 is a root.

So, we can factor the cubic as (v -23/2)(quadratic)=0.

Divide 2v³ -27v² +529 by (v -23/2). Let's perform polynomial division.

Alternatively, since v=23/2 is a root, we can factor it as (v -23/2)(Av² + Bv + C)=2v³ -27v² +529.

Expanding:

v*(Av² + Bv + C) -23/2*(Av² + Bv + C)= Av³ + Bv² + Cv -23/2 Av² -23/2 Bv -23/2 C.

Set equal to 2v³ -27v² +0v +529.

So, equate coefficients:

Av³: A=2.

v² term: B - (23/2)A= -27.

v term: C - (23/2) B=0.

Constant term: -23/2 C=529.

From constant term: -23/2 C=529 => C=529*(-2)/23= -46.

From v term: C - (23/2) B=0 => -46 - (23/2) B=0 => (23/2) B= -46 => B= (-46)*(2)/23= -4.

From v² term: B - (23/2) A= -4 - (23/2)*2= -4 -23= -27, which matches.

So, the quadratic factor is 2v² -4v -46.

So, 2v³ -27v² +529= (v -23/2)(2v² -4v -46).

So, the roots are v=23/2 and roots of 2v² -4v -46=0.

Solving 2v² -4v -46=0:

v=(4 ±sqrt(16 + 368))/4=(4 ±sqrt(384))/4=(4 ±8√6)/4=1 ±2√6.

Since v=xy must be positive, so possible roots are v=23/2≈11.5 and v=1 +2√6≈1 +4.898≈5.898.

The other root is 1 -2√6≈negative, so discard.

So, critical points at v=23/2 and v=1 +2√6.

Now, compute S(v) at these points.

First, v=23/2=11.5.

From earlier, u=(27v -v²)/23.

Compute u=(27*11.5 - (11.5)^2)/23.

27*11.5=310.5.

(11.5)^2=132.25.

So, numerator=310.5 -132.25=178.25.

u=178.25 /23=7.75.

So, S= u +23/v=7.75 +23/11.5=7.75 +2=9.75.

Wait, 23/11.5=2, since 11.5*2=23.

So, S=7.75 +2=9.75=39/4.

Now, for v=1 +2√6≈5.898.

Compute u=(27v -v²)/23.

Compute v=1 +2√6.

v²=(1 +2√6)^2=1 +4√6 +24=25 +4√6.

So, 27v=27*(1 +2√6)=27 +54√6.

So, numerator=27v -v²=27 +54√6 - (25 +4√6)=2 +50√6.

So, u=(2 +50√6)/23.

Then, S= u +23/v.

Compute 23/v=23/(1 +2√6).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 -2√6):

23*(1 -2√6)/[(1)^2 - (2√6)^2]=23*(1 -2√6)/(1 -24)=23*(1 -2√6)/(-23)= -(1 -2√6)=2√6 -1.

So, 23/v=2√6 -1.

Therefore, S= u +23/v= (2 +50√6)/23 +2√6 -1.

Compute as:

= (2 +50√6 +23*(2√6 -1))/23.

Wait, perhaps better to compute as:

(2 +50√6)/23 +2√6 -1.

Convert all terms to have denominator 23:

= (2 +50√6)/23 + (46√6)/23 -23/23.

= [2 +50√6 +46√6 -23]/23.

Combine like terms:

= ( -21 +96√6 )/23.

So, S= ( -21 +96√6 )/23.

Compute this numerically:

96√6≈96*2.449≈235.104.

So, numerator≈-21 +235.104≈214.104.

Denominator=23.

So, S≈214.104/23≈9.31.

So, S≈9.31, which is less than 9.75.

Therefore, the maximum S occurs at v=23/2, which gives S=9.75.

Thus, the maximum S is 39/4.

Therefore, the maximum x² + y² + z²= S² -54= (39/4)^2 -54= (1521/16) -54.

Convert 54 to 16 denominator: 54=864/16.

So, x² + y² + z²=1521/16 -864/16=(1521 -864)/16=657/16.

So, r²= (x² + y² + z²)/4= (657/16)/4=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Simplify 657 and 64: 657 divided by 64 is 10.265625, but as a fraction, 657 and 64 are coprime? Let's check.

657 ÷3=219, 64 ÷3 is not integer.

657 ÷2= not integer, 64 is 2^6.

So, 657 and 64 share no common factors besides 1. So, 657/64 is reduced.

Thus, p=657, q=64, p+q=657 +64=721.

Wait, but earlier when v=23/2, we had x and y such that z=23/(xy)=23/11.5=2.

And x=y=?

Wait, when v=xy=23/2=11.5, and u=x + y=7.75.

So, x + y=7.75, x y=11.5.

So, solving for x and y:

They satisfy the quadratic equation t² -7.75 t +11.5=0.

Compute discriminant: (7.75)^2 -4*11.5=60.0625 -46=14.0625= (3.75)^2.

So, t=(7.75 ±3.75)/2.

Thus, t=(11.5)/2=5.75 or t=(4)/2=2.

So, x=5.75, y=2 or x=2, y=5.75.

So, in this case, the variables are x=5.75, y=2, z=2.

Thus, the box has dimensions 5.75, 2, 2.

Thus, the space diagonal squared is (5.75)^2 +2² +2²=33.0625 +4 +4=41.0625=657/16.

Which is consistent with our earlier calculation.

So, this gives r²=657/64.

Thus, p=657 and q=64, which are coprime, so p+q=721.


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. The radius squared, \( r^2 \), will be the space diagonal squared of the box divided by 4.

1. **Define Variables and Constraints**:
   - Let the dimensions of the box be \( x, y, z \).
   - Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \) ⇒ \( xy + yz + xz = 27 \).
   - Volume: \( xyz = 23 \).

2. **Space Diagonal**:
   - The space diagonal \( d \) of the box is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \).
   - The radius of the sphere is \( r = \frac{d}{2} \), so \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} \).

3. **Express \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \)**:
   - Use the identity \( (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + xz) \).
   - Thus, \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54 \).

4. **Maximize \( x + y + z \)**:
   - To maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \), we need to maximize \( x + y + z \) given the constraints.
   - Using Lagrange multipliers and symmetry, we find that the maximum occurs when two dimensions are equal, \( x = y \), and the third is \( z \).

5. **Solve for Dimensions**:
   - Setting \( x = y \), we derive the equations \( x^2 + 2xz = 27 \) and \( x^2 z = 23 \).
   - Solving these, we find \( x = 2 \), \( y = 2 \), and \( z = 5.75 \).

6. **Calculate \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \)**:
   - Substituting \( x = 2 \), \( y = 2 \), \( z = 5.75 \), we get:
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + (5.75)^2 = 4 + 4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = \frac{657}{16}.
     \]

7. **Compute \( r^2 \)**:
   - \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} = \frac{657}{16 \times 4} = \frac{657}{64} \).

8. **Final Result**:
   - The fraction \( \frac{657}{64} \) is in simplest form, so \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \).
   - Therefore, \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

\boxed{721}
