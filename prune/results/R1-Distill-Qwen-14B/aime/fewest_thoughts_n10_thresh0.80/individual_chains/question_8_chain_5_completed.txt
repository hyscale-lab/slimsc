Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving a^2b, a^2c, etc., which equals 6,000,000. Hmm, let's see.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) to these equations. 

Looking at the second equation, it seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it or find a way to simplify it. Let me see each term:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared and the other to the first power. Maybe I can factor these terms in some way.

Wait, perhaps I can group similar terms. Let's try grouping terms with the same variables:

= a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

That's a good step. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), and similarly for the others.

So let's substitute:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which simplifies to:

= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So the second equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, that looks a bit more manageable but still complex. Maybe I can factor or find some symmetry here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider symmetric functions or think about variables in terms of their sums and products.

Wait, another approach: since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others. But with three variables, that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe assume some ordering, like a ≤ b ≤ c, and then count the number of triples under that assumption and multiply by the number of permutations. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, let me think about the second equation. Maybe I can factor it more cleverly.

Looking back: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Wait, that can be written as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ac(a + c). Hmm, let me check:

ab(a + b) = a²b + ab²

Similarly, bc(b + c) = b²c + bc²

ac(a + c) = a²c + ac²

So yes, adding those gives the entire left-hand side. So, the equation is:

ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ac(a + c) = 6,000,000

But since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express (a + b) as (300 - c), (b + c) as (300 - a), and (a + c) as (300 - b). Let's try that.

So substituting:

ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ac(300 - b) = 6,000,000

Let me expand each term:

ab*300 - ab c + bc*300 - bc a + ac*300 - ac b

Simplify term by term:

= 300ab + 300bc + 300ac - abc - abc - abc

Which simplifies to:

300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000

So, the equation becomes:

300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's actually a big simplification. Let's write that as:

300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000

I can factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ac) - abc] = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000

So now, the problem reduces to solving:

a + b + c = 300

and

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm, this seems more manageable. Maybe I can let s = a + b + c = 300, p = abc, and q = ab + bc + ac.

Then the second equation is:

100 q - p = 2,000,000

So, 100q - p = 2,000,000. Let's keep that in mind.

Also, we have the standard relationships for symmetric sums:

s = a + b + c = 300

q = ab + bc + ac

p = abc

In symmetric polynomials, for three variables, we know that the cubic equation with roots a, b, c is x³ - s x² + q x - p = 0.

So, the equation would be x³ - 300x² + q x - p = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can find another equation involving q and p.

Wait, from the first equation, s = 300, so s² = (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

So, a² + b² + c² = s² - 2q = 300² - 2q = 90,000 - 2q.

But I don't know if that helps. Let me think.

Wait, looking back at the equation 100q - p = 2,000,000, so p = 100q - 2,000,000.

So, p = 100q - 2,000,000.

So, if I can express q in terms of s, which is 300, then maybe I can find possible values.

Wait, but I still have two variables, q and p, so maybe I need another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inequality relationships between symmetric sums.

I know that for nonnegative real numbers, certain inequalities hold, like AM ≥ GM, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the equation p = 100 q - 2,000,000, both q and p are integers, which they are because a, b, c are integers.

So, p must be positive, which implies that 100 q - 2,000,000 > 0, so q > 20,000. So, q > 20,000.

But also, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, the maximum possible value of q is when two variables are as large as possible. Let's think about that.

Wait, for maximum q, given a + b + c = 300, the maximum of ab + bc + ac occurs when the variables are as close as possible. But wait, actually, when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible, but with two variables being equal, perhaps?

Wait, no, actually, for three variables, the maximum of ab + bc + ac occurs when the variables are equal or as close as possible. Because when variables are spread out, their products are smaller.

Wait, let's test: suppose a = b = c = 100. Then ab + bc + ac = 10,000 + 10,000 + 10,000 = 30,000.

If I set a = 200, b = 100, c = 0, then ab + bc + ac = 200*100 + 100*0 + 200*0 = 20,000.

Which is less than 30,000. So, yes, the maximum occurs when the variables are as equal as possible.

So, the maximum q is 30,000 when a = b = c = 100.

Similarly, the minimum q is 0, which occurs when two variables are 0 and the third is 300.

So, q can range from 0 to 30,000. But in our case, p = 100 q - 2,000,000, which implies that q must be at least 20,001 because 100 q must be at least 2,000,000, which would make p positive.

Wait, earlier I thought q must be greater than 20,000, but in reality, since p must be nonnegative (as a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so abc is nonnegative), so 100 q - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 → q ≥ 20,000.

But also, the maximum q is 30,000, as I saw earlier. So q can range from 20,000 to 30,000.

So, possible q values are integers from 20,000 to 30,000.

But wait, for each q in this range, p = 100 q - 2,000,000 must be such that there exist nonnegative integers a, b, c with a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ac = q, and abc = p.

Hmm, so for each q, we can compute p, and then check if there exist integers a, b, c satisfying the three equations. But that seems tedious.

Alternatively, maybe we can find some relationship between these variables.

Wait, perhaps I can write the symmetric cubic equation as x³ - 300x² + q x - p = 0, where p = 100 q - 2,000,000. So substituting p, the equation becomes:

x³ - 300x² + q x - (100 q - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + q x - 100 q + 2,000,000 = 0

Let me factor this expression:

x³ - 300x² + q x - 100 q + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can factor by grouping.

Group terms as (x³ - 300x²) + (q x - 100 q) + 2,000,000 = 0

Factor x² from first group: x²(x - 300)

Factor q from second group: q(x - 100)

So:

x²(x - 300) + q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can factor x - 100 out of some terms.

Wait, let me try to plug x = 100 into the equation:

100³ - 300*(100)^2 + q*100 - 100 q + 2,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 100 q - 100 q + 2,000,000

= (1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 2,000,000) + (100 q - 100 q)

= 0 + 0 = 0

So, x=100 is a root of this equation. Therefore, (x - 100) is a factor.

So, let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Let me factor (x - 100) from x³ - 300x² + q x - 100 q + 2,000,000.

Using polynomial division:

Divide x³ - 300x² + q x - 100 q + 2,000,000 by (x - 100).

Let me set up the division:

Divide x³ - 300x² + q x - 100 q + 2,000,000 by (x - 100).

Using synthetic division:

We know that x = 100 is a root, so I'll use 100 as the synthetic division root.

The coefficients are 1 (x³), -300 (x²), q (x), (-100 q + 2,000,000) (constant term).

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 100 → 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.

Multiply -200 by 100 → -20,000. Add to next coefficient: q + (-20,000) = q - 20,000.

Multiply (q - 20,000) by 100 → 100 q - 2,000,000. Add to last term: (-100 q + 2,000,000) + (100 q - 2,000,000) = 0.

So the division yields:

x² - 200x + (q - 20,000) with no remainder.

So,

x³ - 300x² + q x - 100 q + 2,000,000 = (x - 100)(x² - 200x + q - 20,000)

So, the cubic equation factors into (x - 100)(x² - 200x + (q - 20,000)) = 0.

Therefore, the roots are x = 100 and the roots of x² - 200x + (q - 20,000) = 0.

So, the roots a, b, c are 100 and the roots of x² - 200x + (q - 20,000) = 0.

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the quadratic must factor into integer roots. Let me denote the roots as d and e, so:

d + e = 200

and

d e = q - 20,000

So, d and e are nonnegative integers, because a, b, c are nonnegative integers.

Moreover, since a, b, c are 100, d, e, in some order.

So, the possible triples (a, b, c) are permutations of (100, d, e), where d and e are nonnegative integers such that:

d + e = 200

and

d e = q - 20,000

But from earlier, q is between 20,000 and 30,000, so d e = q - 20,000 implies that d e can be from 0 up to 10,000 (since q can be up to 30,000, q - 20,000 is up to 10,000).

But wait, no: q can be from 20,000 to 30,000, so q - 20,000 can be from 0 to 10,000.

So, d e = q - 20,000 ⇒ d e is between 0 and 10,000.

But d and e are nonnegative integers adding up to 200, so d and e can be 0 to 200.

So, for each possible pair (d, e) where d + e = 200 and d e ≤ 10,000, we can have a corresponding q = d e + 20,000.

But we need to find all such pairs (d, e) such that d e ≤ 10,000.

Wait, but let's think about how d and e relate. Since d + e = 200, and d e = k, where k is between 0 and 10,000.

Wait, but for two positive integers d and e adding to 200, their product d e is maximized when d and e are as close as possible. The maximum product is when d = e = 100, so 100*100=10,000. So, indeed, the maximum product is 10,000, which occurs at d = e = 100.

For other pairs, the product is less than or equal to 10,000.

So, all pairs (d, e) where d + e = 200 and d e ≤ 10,000 are valid.

But since d and e are nonnegative integers, and d + e = 200, the possible pairs are (0,200), (1,199), ..., (100,100).

For each such pair, d e is the product, which is ≤ 10,000.

So, for each (d, e), we can define q = d e + 20,000, and p = 100 q - 2,000,000.

But wait, since p = abc, and a, b, c are 100, d, e, in some order, so p = 100 d e.

Wait, but p = 100 q - 2,000,000, and q = d e + 20,000.

So, substituting:

p = 100*(d e + 20,000) - 2,000,000 = 100 d e + 2,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 100 d e.

Which is consistent because p = 100 d e, as p = a b c = 100 * d * e.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, for each pair (d, e) with d + e = 200, d e ≤ 10,000, the triple (100, d, e) satisfies the required conditions.

But wait, we have to account for all permutations. Because in the original problem, a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so the triples (a, b, c) can be any permutation of (100, d, e).

So, for each unordered pair {d, e}, where d + e = 200, d e ≤ 10,000, the number of ordered triples is equal to the number of permutations of (100, d, e).

But when d and e are distinct, the number of permutations is 6 (since 3! = 6). When d = e, the number of permutations is 3 (since two variables are the same).

But wait, in our case, d and e are nonnegative integers such that d + e = 200.

So, when d = e, which happens when d = e = 100.

So, in that case, the triple is (100, 100, 100), which has only one distinct permutation, but since all three are the same, actually, the number of ordered triples is 1.

Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, when all three numbers are equal, like (100,100,100), how many ordered triples are there? Just one, because all are the same. So, in that case, the number of ordered triples is 1.

But in cases where d ≠ e, each unordered pair {d, e} can be arranged in 6 ways as ordered triples. Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, for example, if d and e are distinct, then the numbers in the triple are 100, d, e. So, how many distinct permutations are there?

Since all three are distinct, the number of permutations is 3! = 6.

But wait, in our case, d and e can be equal, but when d = e = 100, then the triple has all three numbers equal, so only one permutation.

Wait, but when d = e, but d is 100, then the triple is (100,100,100). So, the number of ordered triples is 1.

But if d ≠ e, then the triple has three distinct numbers: 100, d, e. So, the number of ordered triples is 6.

Wait, but wait a second, no.

Wait, no, because if d = e, but d is different from 100, then the triple would have two numbers equal and one different. For example, if d = 100, e = 100: that's the case where all three are 100. But if d = 90, e = 110: but wait, in that case, d + e = 200, but does d e = 90*110=9900, which is ≤10,000.

Wait, no, in that case, d =90, e=110, which sum to 200. So, the triple would be (100,90,110). Which is three distinct numbers, so the number of permutations is 6.

But if d = e = 100, then it's (100,100,100), which is only one permutation.

So, in summary:

- If d = e = 100, then the triple is (100,100,100), which has 1 permutation.

- If d ≠ e, then the triple has three distinct numbers, so the number of ordered triples is 6.

So, to find the total number of triples, I need to count:

1. The number of pairs (d,e) where d + e = 200, d ≤ e, and d e ≤ 10,000.

2. For each such pair, determine whether d = e or d ≠ e, and add the appropriate number of permutations.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to first count all possible pairs (d, e) where d + e = 200, d ≤ e, and d e ≤ 10,000.

Then, for each such pair:

- If d = e (which only happens when d = e = 100), then the number of ordered triples is 1.

- If d ≠ e, then the number of ordered triples is 6.

So, the total number of triples would be:

(Number of such pairs where d ≠ e) * 6 + (Number of pairs where d = e) * 1.

But since d = e only when d = e = 100, which is just one pair, so the number of pairs where d = e is 1.

Thus, the total number of triples is (Total pairs - 1) * 6 + 1.

But wait, let's find how many such pairs (d, e) there are with d + e = 200 and d e ≤ 10,000.

So, let's find all nonnegative integers d and e with d ≤ e, d + e = 200, and d e ≤ 10,000.

We can model this as d(200 - d) ≤ 10,000.

So, 200d - d² ≤ 10,000.

Let me rewrite this as:

-d² + 200d - 10,000 ≤ 0

Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):

d² - 200d + 10,000 ≥ 0

So, solving d² - 200d + 10,000 ≥ 0.

Let's find the roots of the equation d² - 200d + 10,000 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

d = [200 ± sqrt(200² - 4*1*10,000)] / 2

= [200 ± sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2

= [200 ± 0] / 2 → d = 100.

So, the quadratic touches the d-axis at d=100, and since the coefficient of d² is positive, the quadratic is ≥ 0 for all d ≤ 100 and d ≥ 100.

But since d is a nonnegative integer, and d ≤ e (so d ≤ 100), the inequality d² - 200d + 10,000 ≥ 0 holds for all d ≤ 100.

Wait, that seems odd. Wait, the quadratic is d² - 200d + 10,000, which is a parabola opening upwards, with vertex at d=100, where it touches the axis.

So, for d ≤ 100, the quadratic is non-negative (since it's below the vertex where the minimum is zero). So, yes, for all d ≤ 100, d² - 200d + 10,000 ≥ 0.

Therefore, the inequality d² - 200d + 10,000 ≥ 0 is true for all d ≤ 100 or d ≥ 100. But since d ≤ e and d + e = 200, d can be at most 100. So, for d ≤ 100, the inequality holds, meaning that d(200 - d) ≤ 10,000.

Wait, but when d = 100, d e = 100*100=10,000, which satisfies the condition. For d < 100, d e = d (200 - d) is less than 10,000.

So, all pairs (d, e) where d + e = 200 and d ≤ 100 satisfy d e ≤ 10,000.

Therefore, the number of such pairs is the number of nonnegative integers d where d ≤ 100.

But since d and e are nonnegative integers with d + e = 200, and d ≤ e, so d can range from 0 to 100 inclusive.

So, the number of such pairs is 101 (since d can be 0,1,2,...,100).

But each of these pairs corresponds to an unordered pair {d, e}, so the number of unordered pairs is 101.

But wait, when d = 0, e = 200.

When d =1, e=199.

...

When d=100, e=100.

So, that's 101 pairs.

So, each of these 101 pairs gives a unique triple (100, d, e).

Now, for each pair, if d ≠ e, the triple (100, d, e) has 6 permutations.

If d = e, which is only when d=100, e=100, then the triple is (100,100,100), which has only 1 permutation.

So, the total number of ordered triples is:

(Number of pairs where d ≠ e) * 6 + (Number of pairs where d = e) * 1.

Number of pairs where d ≠ e is 101 -1 = 100.

So, total triples = 100 * 6 + 1 * 1 = 600 + 1 = 601.

Wait, but wait, hold on. Let me think again.

Each unordered pair corresponds to ordered triples.

But in our case, the pairs (d, e) are ordered as d ≤ e, so each such pair (d, e) is unique, but when d ≠ e, the number of ordered triples would be 6, as the triple (100, d, e) can be permuted in 6 ways.

But wait, when d ≠ e, the number of ordered triples is 6. But when d = e, the number is 3, because two elements are the same. Wait, no, because in our setup, when d = e = 100, the triple is (100,100,100), so all three elements are same, so only one ordered triple.

Wait, earlier I thought for d ≠ e, the triple is (100, d, e) with three distinct numbers, so 6 permutations. But in reality, if d and e are different from 100, but d ≠ e, then the triple has three distinct elements, so 6 permutations.

Wait, no, because in our case, a, b, c can be any permutation of (100, d, e). So, for example, if d = 90, e = 110, then the triple is (100,90,110), which has three distinct elements, so 6 permutations.

But when d = e = 100, it's (100,100,100), so only one permutation.

So, the total number of ordered triples would be:

For each of the 101 pairs (d, e):

- If d = e =100: contributes 1 ordered triple.

- If d ≠ e: each contributes 6 ordered triples.

So, number of ordered triples = 1 + (101 -1) *6 = 1 + 100 *6 = 1 + 600 = 601.

Wait, but wait, each (d, e) pair is unique with d ≤ e, but when d ≠ e, the triple (100, d, e) and (100, e, d) are the same as unordered pairs but different as ordered pairs.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, in our setup, for each (d, e) where d ≤ e, we have a unique unordered pair. So, for each such pair, if d ≠ e, then the triple (100, d, e) can be arranged in 6 ways, so each contributes 6 ordered triples.

But wait, is that correct? Because when we have a triple (100, d, e), the number of distinct orderings is 6, regardless of d and e's relation to each other.

So, in that case, each unordered pair (d, e) with d ≠ e corresponds to 6 ordered triples, and the pair where d = e =100 corresponds to 1 ordered triple.

So, with 101 such pairs, 100 of which have d ≠ e, the total ordered triples would be 100 *6 +1*1=601.

But wait, let me think about how this can be. Because when d = e, but not 100, then the triple would be (100, d, d), which has three elements: 100, d, d. So, the number of permutations is 3, because two elements are same.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, when d ≠ e, the triple is (100, d, e), which has three distinct elements, so 6 permutations.

When d = e =100, the triple is (100,100,100), which has only one permutation.

But wait, what if d = e but d ≠100? For example, d = e = 50. Then, the triple would be (100,50,50), which has three elements: two 50s and one 100. So, the number of distinct permutations is 3: (100,50,50), (50,100,50), (50,50,100).

So, in that case, each pair where d = e but d ≠100 would contribute 3 ordered triples.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, the quadratic equation only has d = e =100 as a case where d = e.

Wait, no, wait. Because in our setup, (d, e) are pairs such that d + e =200, and d ≤ e. So, when d = e, d must be 100, because 2d =200 ⇒ d=100.

Therefore, the only pair where d = e is (100,100). All other pairs have d ≠ e.

So, for all other pairs (d, e) where d ≠ e, the triple (100, d, e) has three distinct elements, so 6 permutations.

Only the pair (100,100) gives a triple with all elements equal, contributing 1 permutation.

So, the total number of ordered triples is:

Number of pairs where d ≠ e: 100 (since total pairs 101, minus 1 where d = e=100)

Each contributes 6 permutations: 100 *6 = 600

Plus the one pair where d = e=100, contributing 1 permutation: 1

Total: 601 ordered triples.

Wait, but let me check if each pair (d, e) with d + e =200, d ≤ e, and d e ≤10,000 indeed corresponds to a valid solution.

Wait, since d can be from 0 to 100, inclusive, and for each such d, e=200 -d, and d e = d*(200 -d) ≤10,000 because d ≤100.

So yes, all such pairs satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the total number of ordered triples is 601.

But wait, 601? Let me think again.

Wait, the number of unordered pairs is 101. Each of these, except the one where d = e=100, contributes 6 ordered triples, and the one with d = e=100 contributes 1.

So, 100 *6 +1 =601.

Therefore, the answer should be 601.

Wait, but wait, let me think about whether d can be zero.

Because if d=0, then e=200, so the triple is (100,0,200), which sums to 300, and the product terms should satisfy the equation.

Wait, let me check for d=0. Then, e=200.

So, the triple is (100,0,200).

Compute a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b.

Plugging in a=100, b=0, c=200.

Compute each term:

a²b =100² *0=0

a²c=100² *200=10,000*200=2,000,000

b²a =0² *100=0

b²c=0² *200=0

c²a=200² *100=40,000 *100=4,000,000

c²b=200² *0=0

Adding them up: 0 +2,000,000 +0 +0 +4,000,000 +0 =6,000,000.

Which matches the required value.

So, yes, d=0 is valid, and the triple (0,100,200) is a valid solution.

Similarly, when d=1, e=199, the triple is (100,1,199), which should also satisfy the conditions.

So, all these 101 pairs are valid.

Therefore, the total number of ordered triples is 601.

Wait, but wait, the problem says nonnegative integers, so a, b, c can be zero. So, yeah, all these cases are allowed.

So, I think the answer is 601.


To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

1. \( a + b + c = 300 \)
2. \( a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 \)

We rewrite the second equation as:
\[ a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000 \]

Using \( a + b + c = 300 \), we substitute \( b + c = 300 - a \), \( a + c = 300 - b \), and \( a + b = 300 - c \) into the equation:
\[ a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 300a^2 - a^3 + 300b^2 - b^3 + 300c^2 - c^3 = 6,000,000 \]

We factor the equation:
\[ 300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000 \]

Simplifying further:
\[ 100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000 \]

Let \( s = a + b + c = 300 \), \( q = ab + bc + ac \), and \( p = abc \). Then:
\[ 100q - p = 2,000,000 \]
\[ p = 100q - 2,000,000 \]

The cubic equation with roots \( a, b, c \) is:
\[ x^3 - 300x^2 + qx - p = 0 \]

Substituting \( p \):
\[ x^3 - 300x^2 + qx - (100q - 2,000,000) = 0 \]

Factoring:
\[ (x - 100)(x^2 - 200x + (q - 20,000)) = 0 \]

Thus, the roots are \( x = 100 \) and the roots of \( x^2 - 200x + (q - 20,000) = 0 \). Let the roots be \( d \) and \( e \), so:
\[ d + e = 200 \]
\[ de = q - 20,000 \]

Since \( q \) ranges from 20,000 to 30,000, \( de \) ranges from 0 to 10,000. Each pair \( (d, e) \) corresponds to a triple \( (100, d, e) \), and the number of permutations depends on whether \( d \) and \( e \) are distinct or equal.

For each pair \( (d, e) \) with \( d \leq e \) and \( d + e = 200 \):
- If \( d \neq e \), the triple \( (100, d, e) \) has 6 permutations.
- If \( d = e = 100 \), the triple \( (100, 100, 100) \) has 1 permutation.

There are 101 such pairs \( (d, e) \), with 100 pairs where \( d \neq e \) and 1 pair where \( d = e = 100 \). Thus, the total number of ordered triples is:
\[ 100 \times 6 + 1 \times 1 = 601 \]

Therefore, the number of triples is:
\[
\boxed{601}
\]
