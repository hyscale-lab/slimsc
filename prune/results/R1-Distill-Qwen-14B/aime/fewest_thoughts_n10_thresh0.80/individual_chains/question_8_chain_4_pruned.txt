Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It tells me that the sum of the three variables is fixed. The second equation looks more complicated. Let me write it down again to see if I can factor it or simplify it somehow.

The second equation is: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression.

Looking closely, I see that a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

That's a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Substituting these into the equation gives:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Expanding each term, we get:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange this:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's an interesting equation. Maybe I can find a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the known sums from a + b + c.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, this gives:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. Also, from algebra, I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3P. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me double-check. The formula for a³ + b³ + c³ is actually (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Yes, that's right. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

So, substituting S = 300, we have:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P.

Let me compute 300³: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So 300³ = 27,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.

Now, going back to the expression I had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me express a² + b² + c² in terms of S and Q. From before, we have:

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q.

So, substituting back into the equation:

300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2Q):

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2Q) = -600Q.

So, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Next, subtract the other part, which is (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P):

So, the entire expression becomes:

(27,000,000 - 600Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600Q -27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify terms:

27,000,000 -27,000,000 cancels out.

-600Q + 900Q = 300Q.

So, 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so we have a relationship between Q and P. Now, I also know that in the realm of symmetric polynomials, for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are S = a + b + c, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. So, the variables a, b, c are the roots of the cubic equation x³ - Sx² + Qx - P = 0, which in this case is x³ - 300x² + Qx - P = 0.

But not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can find another equation involving Q and P.

Wait, let's recap:

We have:

1. a + b + c = 300.

2. a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q.

3. a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.

4. From the main equation, we found that 100Q - P = 2,000,000, so P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, substituting P into the expression for a³ + b³ + c³:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3*(100Q - 2,000,000).

Compute 3*(100Q - 2,000,000) = 300Q - 6,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 300Q -6,000,000.

Combine like terms:

27,000,000 -6,000,000 = 21,000,000.

-900Q + 300Q = -600Q.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q.

Wait, but earlier, from the equation we had:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

But we already used that to find the relationship between Q and P. So maybe this doesn't add new information.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible values of a, b, c.

Wait, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300, perhaps many of them are zero? Or maybe they are equal?

Let me consider symmetric cases. Suppose a = b = c. Then a + b + c = 3a = 300 => a
