Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given: AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. I need to find AP, which can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling some important theorems and properties related to circles, tangents, and intersecting chords. I remember that the tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, DB is tangent to ω at B, meaning that DB is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω. Similarly, DC is tangent at C, so DC is perpendicular to OC.

Another thing I remember is the power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC² because DB and DC are tangent lengths from D to ω. So, DB = DC, right? Wait, no, that's only if D is equidistant from B and C, which isn't necessarily the case here. Hmm, maybe not. Actually, the power of D is equal to DB² = DC² because both are tangent lengths from D to ω. So, DB = DC. That's an important point. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Wait, so if DB = DC, then triangle DBC is isoceles with base BC. So, the line AD, which connects A to D, might have some properties. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

I also remember that when two chords intersect in a circle, the products of their segments are equal. Maybe that comes into play here when AD intersects ω at P.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. AD intersects ω again at P, so AP is the length from A to P, which is a point on the circumcircle.

I think I should first find some properties of triangle ABC. Maybe compute its area, circumradius, or something like that. Let me calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of triangle ABC to find its area using Heron's formula.

The sides are a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Now, area (Δ) = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[12(12 - 9)(12 - 10)(12 - 5)] = √[12 * 3 * 2 * 7] = √(504).

Simplify √504: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, no, let me factor it properly.

504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't integer. Wait, 504 ÷ 4 = 126. 126 ÷ 4 = 31.5 still. Hmm, maybe 504 = 16 * 31.5 isn't correct. Let's factor 504:

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷ 2 = 126

126 ÷ 2 = 63

63 ÷ 3 = 21

21 ÷ 3 = 7

So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7^1.

So, √504 = √(2^3 * 3^2 * 7) = 2^(1.5) * 3 * √7 = 2 * √2 * 3 * √7 = 6√14.

So, area Δ = 6√14.

Now, the circumradius R of triangle ABC can be found using the formula:

Δ = (a b c) / (4 R)

So, R = (a b c) / (4 Δ)

Plugging in the values:

a=9, b=10, c=5, Δ=6√14.

So,

R = (9 * 10 * 5) / (4 * 6√14) = (450) / (24√14) = (75) / (4√14)

Simplify this by rationalizing the denominator:

R = (75√14) / (4 * 14) = (75√14) / 56.

Okay, so R = 75√14 / 56. That's the circumradius.

Now, moving on to point D. Since DB and DC are tangents from D to ω, and we know that DB = DC, as I thought earlier. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Wait, but how does point D relate to triangle ABC? Maybe I can find coordinates for the points and compute D's coordinates. Alternatively, maybe use coordinate geometry to model this problem.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, point B can be somewhere,
