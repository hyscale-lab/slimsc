Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's interesting. I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me write down what's given:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

Let me think about the second equation. It looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or rewrite it in a more manageable way.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

I notice that each term is a product of two variables, where one is squared. So, for example, a²b and a²c are both a² multiplied by b and c respectively.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out a² from the first two terms: a²(b + c). Similarly, from the next two terms, b²(a + c), and the last two, c²(a + b). So, let me rewrite the equation:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, since I know that a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let's try that.

So substituting, the equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, for b and c.

So the entire equation becomes:

(300a² - a³) + (300b² - b³) + (300c² - c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange this:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now I have 300(a² + b² + c²) minus the sum of the cubes equals 6,000,000.

Wait, maybe I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums. I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed using (a + b + c)^3 and other terms.

The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q.

Similarly, a² + b² + c² can be expressed as (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S² - 2P.

So, substituting these into the equation:

300(S² - 2P) - [S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, S is 300, so S² = 300² = 90,000. S³ = 300³ = 27,000,000.

So, 300(S² - 2P) = 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600P.

Then, subtracting [S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q], which is 27,000,000 - 3*300*P + 3 Q = 27,000,000 - 900 P + 3 Q.

So the entire left side becomes:

[27,000,000 - 600 P] - [27,000,000 - 900 P + 3 Q] 

= 27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900 P - 3 Q

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) - 3 Q

= 0 + 300 P - 3 Q

So, the equation becomes:

300 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.

I can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 3:

100 P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, Q = 100 P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So, now I have an expression relating Q and P.

But I also know that in symmetric equations, for variables a, b, c, the elementary symmetric sums are S, P, Q. And we have S = 300, P is ab + bc + ca, and Q is abc.

So, in other words, the variables a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation:

x³ - S x² + P x - Q = 0.

Which would be:

x³ - 300 x² + P x - Q = 0.

And since Q = 100 P - 2,000,000, we can substitute that in:

x³ - 300 x² + P x - (100 P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this. Let me see:

x³ - 300x² + P x - 100 P + 2,000,000.

Maybe factor by grouping. Let's group the first two terms and the last two terms:

(x³ - 300x²) + (P x - 100 P) + 2,000,000.

Factor x² from the first group: x²(x - 300)
Factor P from the second group: P(x - 100)

So, the equation becomes:

x²(x - 300) + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor terms involving P:

Looking back, x³ - 300x² + Px - 100 P + 2,000,
