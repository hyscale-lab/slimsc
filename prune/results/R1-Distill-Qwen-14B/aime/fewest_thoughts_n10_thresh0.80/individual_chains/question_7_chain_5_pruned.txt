Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex can be colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the octagon has 8 vertices, and each is colored red or blue independently. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. So, the denominator of our probability is going to be 256.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation such that every blue vertex is moved to a position that was originally red. Hmm. So, we need to count how many such colorings exist.

Wait, but how do we approach this? Maybe using group theory or something related to Burnside's lemma? I remember Burnside's lemma is useful for counting orbits under group actions, which in this case would be rotations.

But let me think. The octagon's rotations form a group of order 8 (rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째). Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points of these group actions.

But wait, in this problem, we're not counting orbits of colorings, but rather colorings that satisfy a certain condition. So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me think about the condition. We need that there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices are moved to red positions. So, for a given coloring, if we rotate it by some rotation, all blue vertices in the original coloring end up on red vertices in the original coloring.

Alternatively, if we denote the original coloring as C, and the rotated coloring as R(C), then for each blue vertex in C, R(C) must have a red vertex. Wait, no, that might not be the right way to think about it.

Wait another way: For each blue vertex in the original coloring, when we rotate the octagon by some amount, that blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red.

So, the rotation must map the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. Because all the blue vertices are moved to red positions, which implies that the image of the blue set under rotation is exactly the red set.

But since the octagon is regular, the sets of red and blue vertices must be rotationally congruent. Hmm, that might not always be true.

Wait, perhaps another way: Let's consider that for a coloring to satisfy the condition, the set of blue vertices must be a rotated version of the set of red vertices. Because if you rotate the octagon such that each blue vertex is moved to a red position, then the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but since every coloring has exactly 8 vertices, the number of red and blue vertices can vary. Wait, no! Each vertex is colored either red or blue, so the number of red and blue vertices can vary from 0 to 8. But in our problem, each vertex is colored independently with red or blue,
