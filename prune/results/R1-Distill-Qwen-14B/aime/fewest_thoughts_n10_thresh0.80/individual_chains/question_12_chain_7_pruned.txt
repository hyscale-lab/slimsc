Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum should be 999, and when I read them top to bottom, their sum should be 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2 row by 3 column grid. So, each row has three digits, and each column has two digits. When read left to right, each row forms a number. The top row will be a three-digit number, say ABC, and the bottom row will be DEF. So, ABC + DEF = 999. 

Similarly, when read top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column would be A followed by D, forming AD, the second column is B followed by E, forming BE, and the third column is C followed by F, forming CF. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find all possible digit assignments to the cells A, B, C, D, E, F such that both these conditions are satisfied.

Let me write down the equations:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Let me translate these into numerical terms. ABC is 100*A + 10*B + C, and DEF is 100*D + 10*E + F. So:

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Similarly, AD is 10*A + D, BE is 10*B + E, CF is 10*C + F. So:

(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

Let me write these equations more neatly:

Equation (1): 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Equation (2): 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99.

Hmm, perhaps I can manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

First, let me subtract equation (2) from equation (1). Let's see:

Equation (1) minus Equation (2):

(100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F) - (10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F) = 999 - 99.

Simplifying the left side:

100A -10A = 90A

10B -10B = 0

C -10C = -9C

100D - D = 99D

10E - E = 9E

F - F = 0

So, the entire left side becomes 90A -9C +99D +9E.

And the right side is 999 -99 = 900.

So:

90A -9C +99D +9E = 900.

I can factor out a 9:

9*(10A - C + 11D + E) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10A - C + 11D + E = 100.

Hmm, that's a helpful equation. Let me write that as Equation (3):

10A - C + 11D + E = 100.

So now, I have equation (3) derived from the two initial conditions. Let me think about how to use this.

Also, since each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit, their possible values are from 0 to 9. But I should note that A and D can't be zero because they are the first digits of three-digit and two-digit numbers, respectively.

Wait, no. Let me check that. In the example given, the top row starts with 0, which is allowed because it's a three-digit number? Wait, no, 0 as the first digit would make it a two-digit number. Hmm, but the problem statement says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right". So, ABC and DEF are two numbers. If A is 0, then ABC would be a two-digit number, but in the example given, the top row is 008, which is 8, a single-digit number, but the problem says "the two numbers formed by reading left to right". So perhaps the numbers can have leading zeros. So, A can be zero, making ABC a two-digit or one-digit number. Similarly, D can be zero because it's the first digit of DEF, a three-digit number. Wait, no, DEF is a three-digit number, so D can't be zero because that would make it a two-digit number. Wait, in the example given, the bottom row is 991, which is a three-digit number. So, for DEF, D cannot be zero. Similarly, for ABC, A can be zero, as the example shows (008 is considered as 8, but perhaps leading zeros are allowed, making ABC a three-digit number with leading zeros. Hmm, the problem statement isn't entirely clear on this, but the example has A=0, so perhaps leading zeros are allowed for ABC but not for DEF. Wait, in the example, the bottom row is 9,9,1, so D=9, which is non-zero. So DEF is 991, a three-digit number. So for DEF, D cannot be zero. But for ABC, since the example has A=0, perhaps ABC can be a number with leading zeros, making it effectively a one-digit or two-digit number. So, A can be zero, but D cannot be zero.

Similarly, when considering the columns, each column forms a two-digit number, so the first digit (top digit) of each column cannot be zero. Wait, in the example, the first column is 0 and 9, making 09, which is 9. But in the problem statement, it's written as 9, so perhaps leading zeros are allowed in the columns as well. Hmm, the example shows that the sum of the top to bottom numbers is 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Wait, the first column is 0 and 9, which is 09, which is 9, so perhaps leading zeros are allowed in the columns as well. So, A can be zero, D can be non-zero, but for the column numbers, the top digit can be zero, making it a single-digit number. So, I think in this problem, leading zeros are allowed for the purposes of forming numbers, but when we're talking about the digits themselves, they can be 0-9.

Wait, but in the example, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991, which is 99
