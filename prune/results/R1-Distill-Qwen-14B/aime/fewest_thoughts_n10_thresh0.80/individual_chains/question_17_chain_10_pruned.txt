Okay, so I have this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then find r squared, which is expressed as a fraction p/q. Finally, I have to find p+q.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know that the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box will have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal is the longest diagonal inside the box, stretching from one corner to the opposite corner. So, if I can find the maximum possible space diagonal for boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, that will be twice the radius of the sphere. Then, I can find r by dividing that diagonal by 2.

Wait, but actually, no. The sphere must contain each box, so the radius must be large enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal. So, I think I need to maximize the space diagonal given the constraints of surface area and volume. Because the sphere must contain all such boxes, the radius must accommodate the box with the maximum space diagonal. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible space diagonal for boxes in set B, then r would be half of that.

So, let me formalize this. Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, z. Then, surface area S is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. Volume V is xyz = 23.

The space diagonal d is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, I need to maximize d, given S and V.

Wait, but how do I maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

I remember that for optimization with constraints, Lagrange multipliers can be used, but I might need to use some inequalities or maybe AM-QM or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of S and V.

Wait, I know that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2S.

But I don't know x + y + z, so maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inequality between quadratic mean and geometric mean.

Wait, but maybe I should consider using Lagrange multipliers here. Let me set up the function to maximize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints: g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The method would involve taking the gradient of f equal to a linear combination of the gradients of g and h. That is:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

So, compute the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z).

∇g = (2(y + z), 2(x + z), 2(x + y)).

∇h = (yz, xz, xy).

So, setting up the equations:

2x = λ * 2(y + z) + μ * yz.

2y = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz.

2z = λ * 2(x + y) + μ * xy.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Is there symmetry here? Maybe if the box is a cube, but in this case, the volume is 23, which is not a perfect cube, so probably not a cube. But maybe two sides are equal.

Wait, perhaps without loss of generality, I can assume that x = y. Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Let me try that.

Let me assume x = y. Then, since x = y, let me denote x = y = a, and z = b.

So, the surface area constraint becomes 2(a² + ab + ab) = 54 → 2a² + 4ab = 54 → a² + 2ab = 27.

The volume constraint is a² b = 23.

Also, the space diagonal becomes sqrt(2a² + b²).

So, now I can express everything in terms of a and b.

So, from the volume constraint: b = 23 / a².

Substitute into the surface area equation: a² + 2a*(23 / a²) = 27.

Simplify:

a² + (46 / a) = 27.

Multiply both sides by a: a³ + 46 = 27a.

So, a³ - 27a + 46 = 0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Maybe we can find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a = 2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So a=2 is a root.
