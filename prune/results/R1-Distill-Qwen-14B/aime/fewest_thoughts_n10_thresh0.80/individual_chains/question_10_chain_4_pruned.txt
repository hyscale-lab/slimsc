Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. And it's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let me understand what Bob is doing. He's creating sets B where each B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and the maximum element in each B is in Alice's set A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can form sets where a is the maximum. The question is, how many such sets are there for each a?

Wait, so for each a in A, how many finite nonempty sets have a as their maximum? Well, if the maximum is a, then all other elements in the set must be less than a. So, the other elements can be any positive integers less than a, but they have to form a nonempty set. Wait, no, actually, the set B can be just {a}, right? Because it's nonempty. So, for each a, the number of possible sets B where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} including the empty set, but since B must be nonempty, we have 2^(a-1) subsets, but subtract 1 because we can't have the empty set. Wait, no, actually, for each a, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set. Because to form a set B with maximum a, you can choose any subset from the numbers less than a and then add a to it. So, the number is 2^(a-1). But wait, B is a nonempty set, so actually, the number is 2^(a-1), because the subset can include the empty set (which when added to a gives {a}), which is acceptable since B is nonempty. Wait, no, if the subset is empty, adding a gives {a}, which is a nonempty set. So yes, 2^(a-1) sets for each a.

So, if A has elements a1, a2, ..., ak, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^(a-1).

But wait, let me make sure. Suppose A has two elements, say {2,3}. Then, for a=2, the sets are {2}, {1,2}. For a=3, the sets are {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. So, that's 2^(2-1) = 2 sets for a=2, and 2^(3-1)=4 sets for a=3. Total sets would be 2 + 4 = 6. Let's count them: {2}, {1,2}, {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. Yes, that's 6. So the formula holds.

Therefore, the total number of sets Bob can list is the sum over a in A of 2^(a
