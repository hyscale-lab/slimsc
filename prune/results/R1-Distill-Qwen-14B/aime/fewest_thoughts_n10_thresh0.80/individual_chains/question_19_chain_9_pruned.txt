Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius 13. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's the center of the inscribed circle with radius 6.

The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. That's an interesting condition. I'm not sure I remember a standard property about this, so maybe I'll need to derive something.

Let me think about coordinate geometry. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system to simplify the problem. Let's assume point I is at the origin to make calculations easier. So, if I is at (0,0), then O is some point (h, k) such that the vector OI is (h, k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector IA should be perpendicular to OI.

Wait, but IA is from I (which is at (0,0)) to A. So point A would be at some (x, y). The vector IA is (x, y), and OI is (h, k). Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular. So x*h + y*k = 0.

Hmm, but without knowing where A is, that might not be immediately helpful. Maybe I should consider other properties or formulas that relate the inradius, circumradius, and sides of the triangle.

I recall that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI^2 = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if that's correct. Oh wait, yes, I think that's a standard formula. So plugging in R=13 and r=6, OI^2 = 13*(13-12) = 13*1 =13. So OI = sqrt(13). That's good to know.

So the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Since I is at (0,0) and O is at (h,k), then h^2 + k^2 = 13.

Also, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. So their dot product is zero. So (h, k) Â· (x, y) = 0, which is h*x + k*y = 0.

But I don't know where point A is, so maybe I need another approach.

Wait, maybe I can use trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and
