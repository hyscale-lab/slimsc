Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the product AB·AC in triangle ABC. Let's see, the problem states that triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should recall what circumradius and inradius mean. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. So, in this case, R = 13 and r = 6.

Now, the key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That means the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. So, IA ⊥ OI. That must have some special properties or relations that can help us find AB·AC.

I remember that in any triangle, the incenter (I) is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter (O) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. Their positions relative to each other can vary, but in this case, there's a specific perpendicularity condition.

I think I should draw a diagram. Let me visualize triangle ABC with O and I somewhere inside. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA must be a right-angled triangle with the right angle at I. Wait, no, because IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I between IA and OI.

So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, we can write (IO)^2 + (IA)^2 = (OA)^2. But wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA = 13.

But IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A. I don't remember a direct formula for IA, but I think there are some relations involving the inradius and the distances from the incenter to the vertices.

Wait, I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed using the formula:

IA = √(r^2 + (s - a)^2)

where r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC.

Similarly, the distance from I to O is given by the formula:

IO = √(R(R - 2r))

I think that's correct. Let me confirm. Yes, in Euler's formula, the distance between incenter and circumcenter is IO^2 = R(R - 2r). So, substituting R = 13 and r = 6, we get:

IO^2 = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, IO = √13.

Okay, so IO is √13. Then, IA can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle IOA:

IA^2 + IO^2 = OA^2

But OA is the circumradius, so OA = 13. So,

IA^2 + (√13)^2 = 13^2
IA^2 + 13 = 169
IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156
IA = √156 = 2√39

Alternatively, we can write IA as √(r^2 + (s - a)^2). Let's set that equal to 2√39.

So:

√(r^2 + (s - a)^2) = 2√39

Squaring both sides,

r^2 + (s - a)^2 = 4*39 = 156

But
