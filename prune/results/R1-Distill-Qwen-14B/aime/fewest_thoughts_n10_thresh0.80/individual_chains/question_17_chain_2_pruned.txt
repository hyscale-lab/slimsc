Okay, so I've got this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The question is asking for r squared, where r is the radius of that sphere, and then express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. 

Let me try to break this down. First, the problem mentions a set of rectangular boxes, which I assume are all the possible boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. So each box has dimensions length, width, height, say x, y, z. So the surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23.

Now, for each such box, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain it. The sphere's center would probably be at the center of the box, right? Because the sphere needs to contain all eight vertices of the box, so the radius would be half the space diagonal of the box. So the sphere's radius r is half of the space diagonal, which is sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. Therefore, r squared would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So our goal is to minimize (x² + y² + z²) because that will minimize r squared.

So essentially, we need to find the minimal possible value of (x² + y² + z²) given the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, okay, so this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me recall how that works. We set up a function to minimize, which is f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints says that the gradient of f should be a linear combination of the gradients of g and h. That is, ∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h, where λ and μ are the multipliers.

Let's compute the gradients.

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)

∇g = (2y + 2z, 2x + 2z, 2x + 2y)

Wait, hold on. Because g is 2(xy + yz + xz), so dg/dx = 2(y + z), dg/dy = 2(x + z), and dg/dz = 2(x + y). So ∇g = (2(y + z), 2(x + z), 2(x + y)).

Similarly, ∇h = (yz, xz, xy).

So, setting up the equations:

2x = λ * 2(y + z) + μ * yz

2y = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz

2z = λ * 2(x + y) + μ * xy

And also, we have the constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27

and xyz = 23.

Hmm, so we have three equations from the gradients, plus two constraints. That's five equations with four variables x, y, z, λ, μ. So, seems solvable.

Let me try to write down the equations:

1) 2x = 2λ(y + z) + μ yz

2) 2y = 2λ(x + z) + μ xz

3) 2z = 2λ(x + y) + μ xy

And then:

4) xy + yz + xz = 27

5) xyz = 23

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equations to eliminate some variables. Let's subtract equation 1 and 2:

2x - 2y = 2λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz)

Simplify:

2(x - y) = 2λ(y - x) + μ z(y - x)

Factor out (x - y):

2(x - y) = (x - y)(-2λ - μ z)

If x ≠ y, then we can divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = -2λ - μ z → 2λ + μ z = -2

Similarly, subtract equation 1 and 3:

2x - 2z = 2λ(y + z - x - y) + μ(yz - xy)

Simplify:

2(x - z) = 2λ(z - x) + μ y(z - x)

Factor:

2(x - z) = (z - x)(2λ + μ y)

Which becomes:

2(x - z) = -(x - z)(2λ + μ y)

If x ≠ z, then we can divide both sides by (x - z):

2 = - (2λ + μ y) → 2λ + μ y = -2

So now we have two equations:

2λ + μ z = -2

2λ + μ y = -2

Subtracting these gives:

μ z - μ y = 0 → μ(z - y) = 0

So either μ = 0 or z = y.

If μ = 0, then from equation 1: 2x = 2λ(y + z) → x = λ(y + z)

Similarly, equation 2: 2y = 2λ(x + z) → y = λ(x + z)

And equation 3: 2z = 2λ(x + y) → z = λ(x + y)

But if μ = 0, then from the earlier equations, 2λ + 0 = -2 → λ = -1.

So, x = -1*(y + z) → x = -(y + z)

Similarly, y = -1*(x + z) → y = -(x + z)

And z = -1*(x + y) → z = -(x + y)

Hmm, but let's see if this is possible.

From x = -(y + z), and y = -(x + z), substituting x:

y = -(-y - z + z) → y = -(-y) → y = y → 0=0, which is always true.

Similarly, z = -(x + y) = -(-y - z + y) = -(-z) → z = z. No new info.

So, this suggests that with μ=0, we have x = -(y + z), y = -(x + z), z = -(x + y).

But let's see if this leads to a feasible solution.

From x = -(y + z), and y = -(x + z), then substituting x into y:

y = -(-y - z + z) = -(-y) = y → 0=0.

Similarly, no constraints.

But we have the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27

xyz = 23

But if x = -(y + z), let's see: Let me denote s = y + z, so x = -s

Then, the surface area equation:

xy + yz + xz = x(y + z) + yz = (-s)(s) + yz = -s² + yz = 27

And the volume:

xyz = (-s)(y)(z) = -s y z = 23 → s y z = -23

So, from the surface area:

yz = 27 + s²

From the volume:

s y z = -23 → s (27 + s²) = -23 → s³ + 27 s + 23 = 0

So, we have a cubic equation: s³ + 27 s + 23 = 0.

Hmm, let's see if this cubic has real roots.

Testing s = -1: (-1)^3 + 27*(-1) +23 = -1 -27 +23 = -5 ≠0

s = -2: -8 -54 +23 = -39 ≠0

s = -3: -27 -81 +23 = -85 ≠0

s = -4: -64 -108 +23 = -149 ≠0

s = 1: 1 +27 +23=51≠0

s=2:8+54+23=85≠0

Hmm, so it's not obvious. Maybe using rational root theorem, possible roots would be ±1, ±23, etc. But none seem to satisfy.

Alternatively, perhaps using the cubic formula or graphing.

The function f(s) = s³ +27s +23.

f(-3)= (-27) + (-81) +23 = -85.

f(-2)= (-8) + (-54) +23= -39.

f(-1)= -1 -27 +23= -5.

f(0)=0 +0 +23=23.

f(1)=1+27+23=51.

So, there's a root between s=-2 and s=-1, since f(-2)=-39, f(-1)=-5, but no sign change. Wait, s=-3 is -85, s=-2 is -39, s=-1 is -5, s=0 is 23.

So, between s=-1 and s=0, f(s) goes from -5 to 23, so crosses zero. Therefore, there is a real root between -1 and 0.

But even so, I don't know, this seems messy. Maybe this is not the right path. Perhaps the assumption that x ≠ y ≠ z is incorrect? Or perhaps μ is not zero.

Alternatively, maybe all the variables are equal? Let's check if x = y = z.

If x = y = z, then surface area is 2(3x²)=6x²=54 → x²=9 → x=3. So volume is x³=27, but the volume given is 23. So x≠y≠z, so they can't all be equal. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps two variables are equal. Let's say x = y. Then, we can try that.

Assume x = y. Then, let's see.

From the surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → 2(x² + 2xz) =54 → x² + 2xz =27.

From the volume: x x z = x² z =23 → z =23/(x²)

So, substituting into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) =27 → x² + 46/x =27.

Multiply both sides by x: x³ +46=27x → x³ -27x +46=0.

Let's solve this cubic equation. Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1:1 -27 +46=20≠0

x=2:8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (x-2)(x² + 2x -23)=0.

So, x=2, or x² +2x -23=0 → x=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ±4√6)/2= -1 ±2√6.

Since x must be positive, x= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible x=2, or x= -1 +2√6.

So, for x=2: since x=y=2, z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, dimensions would be 2,2,5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z²: 4 +4 + (23/4)^2= 8 + (529/16)= (128 +529)/16= 657/16=41.0625.

So, r²=(41.0625)/4=10.265625=657/64.

Wait, 657 divided by 64 is 10.265625.

Alternatively, for x= -1 +2√6.

Compute x= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, x=y≈3.898, and z=23/(x²)≈23/(15.196)≈1.514.

Compute x² + y² + z²: 2*(3.898)^2 + (1.514)^2≈2*(15.196) + 2.292≈30.392 +2.292≈32.684.
