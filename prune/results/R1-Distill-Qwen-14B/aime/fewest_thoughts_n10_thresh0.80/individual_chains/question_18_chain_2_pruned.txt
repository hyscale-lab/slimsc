Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a high number of sides like a dodecagon, there are many diagonals, so the number of rectangles could be quite large. But I need to figure out a systematic way to count them.

First, let me recall what a regular dodecagon is. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees. Now, the problem is about forming rectangles where each side is either a side or a diagonal of this dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned with the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

I think the key here is to realize that for a rectangle to be formed, we need two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if they are separated by a certain number of steps around the polygon. For example, in a regular hexagon, each opposite side is parallel, but in a dodecagon, there are more possibilities for parallel sides and diagonals.

Wait, in a regular polygon, two sides are parallel if the number of sides between them is half the total number of sides. For a dodecagon, that would be 6 sides apart. So, sides opposite each other are parallel. Similarly, diagonals can also be parallel if they span the same number of sides as another diagonal, but starting from different vertices.

So, for the rectangle, we need two pairs of such parallel lines. Each pair will form opposite sides of the rectangle. So, the problem reduces to finding all possible pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) and then determining how many rectangles can be formed by choosing two such pairs that intersect to form a rectangle.

But how exactly do I count these pairs?

Let me think. Each side of the dodecagon is a side, and each diagonal can be categorized by the number of sides they skip. For example, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between skips one side, so it's a "step" of 2. Similarly, a diagonal that skips two vertices is a step of 3, and so on.

In a regular dodecagon, the possible step sizes for diagonals are from 2 to 5 because beyond that, the diagonals would start repeating in the other direction. For example, a step of 6 would be a diameter, but since it's a 12-gon, stepping 6 from any vertex brings you to the opposite vertex.

Wait, actually, in a regular dodecagon, the maximum unique step is 5 because stepping 6 would be the diameter, but stepping 7 would be equivalent to stepping 5 in the opposite direction, stepping 8 equivalent to stepping 4, and so on. So, the diagonals can be of lengths corresponding to steps of 2,3,4,5,6,7,... but considering symmetry, steps beyond 6 would mirror the previous ones. So, for diagonals, steps from 2 to 6 are considered unique.

Wait, no. Actually, stepping 1 is a side, stepping 2 is a diagonal, stepping 3 is another diagonal, stepping 4, stepping 5, stepping 6 is the diameter. Steps beyond 6 would start overlapping with the other side. So, for diagonals, the step sizes are from 2 to 6, inclusive.

So, for each step size k (where k=2,3,4,5,6), the number of diagonals with that step size is 12, since for each vertex, you can draw one diagonal stepping k vertices away, and since each diagonal is counted twice (once from each end), the number is 12 for each k. Wait, no, that can't be right because for step size k, each diagonal is shared by two vertices, so the number of unique diagonals for each step size k is 12/2=6. Wait, no, that's not correct either.

Wait, actually, in a regular n-gon, the number of diagonals with step size k is n, but each diagonal is counted twice (once from each end). So, for each k from 2 to floor(n/2), the number of unique diagonals is n/2 if n is even, but wait, when n is even, for k = n/2, each diagonal is unique because stepping k from a vertex leads to the opposite vertex, which isn't revisited. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me get this straight. For a regular n-gon, the number of diagonals with step size k (where k=2,3,...,
