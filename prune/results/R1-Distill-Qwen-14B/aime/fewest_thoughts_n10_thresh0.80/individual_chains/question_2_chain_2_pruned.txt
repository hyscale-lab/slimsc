Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and figure out what's going on. 

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway to (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit more than halfway to (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment of length 1, lying in the first quadrant. Point P is on the x-axis and point Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is like a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is exactly 1. 

We need to find a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. Then, we have to find OC² and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Hmm. So, first, maybe I should figure out what AB looks like. Points A and B are given, so AB is a line segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me write the equation of AB.

The slope of AB would be (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). 

Using point-slope form, let's write the equation. Using point A (1/2, 0), the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, AB is the line y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, point C is on AB, so its coordinates must satisfy this equation. Let me denote point C as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, the point C is (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). 

The problem states that C is on AB but doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. That means, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, the only segment in F that passes through C is AB itself.

So, perhaps AB is one of the segments in F? Let me check. AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the length of AB to see if it's 1.

The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is indeed a member of F. So, AB is one of the segments PQ in F, with P at A and Q at B.

So, the family F consists of all such segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, and PQ of length 1. Each such PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers such that sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, since the length is 1.

Given that, the equation of PQ is (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, right? Because PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, q), so intercept form.

So, for any such PQ, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, which is such a segment, and it's the only point on AB that's not on any other segment from F. So, we need to find the point C on AB where no other PQ in F passes through it.

So, suppose there exists some other PQ in F that passes through C. Then, we want to ensure that this doesn't happen except for AB itself.

Therefore, point C should be such that it cannot lie on any other PQ in F except AB. So, for all other PQ in F, the equation x/p + y/q = 1 does not hold when evaluated at point C.

Alternatively, if we solve for p and q, given C = (x, y), then the equation x/p + y/q = 1 must not have a solution (p, q) other than (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), because AB is already a member of F.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for point C, the set of all PQ in F that pass through C corresponds to some conditions on p and q. We need that the only solution is p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, meaning that the only PQ in F that passes through C is AB itself.

So, perhaps we can set up the equation x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1, and find conditions on x and y such that this system has a unique solution for p and q, which is p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, if we have point C = (x, y), then the equation x/p + y/q = 1 must have only one solution (p, q) such that p² + q² =1. So, solving for p and q, given x and y.

Let me write the equations:

Equation 1: x/p + y/q = 1

Equation 2: p² + q² = 1

Let me solve for p and q in terms of x and y.

From Equation 1: x/p = 1 - y/q → x/p = (q - y)/q → x = p*(q - y)/q → x = p*(1 - y/q)

But maybe it's better to express q from Equation 1 in terms of p, then substitute into Equation 2.

From Equation 1: x/p + y/q = 1 → y/q = 1 - x/p → q = y / (1 - x/p)

Substitute into Equation 2: p² + [y / (1 - x/p)]² = 1

Let me denote t = p. Then,

t² + [ y / (1 - x/t) ]² = 1
