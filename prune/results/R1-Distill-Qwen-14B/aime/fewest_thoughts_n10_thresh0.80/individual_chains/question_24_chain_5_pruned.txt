Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have a list of positive integers with certain properties. Let me try to break down each property and see how I can find the list, then calculate the sum of the squares of all the items.

First, the sum of the items is 30. That's straightforward—whatever list I come up with, when I add all the numbers together, it should equal 30.

Next, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, so 9 has to appear more times than any other number. So, I need 9 to be the most frequent number, and no other number can have the same frequency as 9.

The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. Hmm, that's interesting. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. For an even-numbered list, it's the average of the two middle numbers, but here it's specified as a positive integer, so maybe it's the lower of the two middle numbers? Or perhaps the average of the two is an integer not in the list.

Wait, wait. The problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one, which must be an integer not in the list. Wait, but the list is made up of positive integers. So, the median is an integer not in the list. That seems a bit tricky because the median is the middle value. So for example, if the list has 5 numbers, the third one is the median. But the median can't be equal to any of the numbers in the list, so the third number must be different from all others. But that's impossible because the third number is part of the list. Therefore, maybe the list has an even number of elements. Let me think.

Wait, no. Wait, if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So, if the average is an integer but not present in the list, that's possible. For example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median would be 9, which is an integer not in the list. That makes sense. So, the median is 9, and it's not present in the list.

So, putting that together, the median is 9, and 9 is the mode as well. Wait, no, the mode is 9, but the median is 9 and it's not in the list. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if the median is 9, and the numbers are arranged in order, the middle value is 9, but 9 is not in the list. So, how can 9 be the mode if it's not in the list? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Let me check again. The problem says:

- Sum is 30.

- Unique mode is 9.

- Median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Wait, so the median is a positive integer, but it's not in the list. Then, how can 9 be the mode if it's not in the list? Because mode requires that the number appears most frequently, so it has to be in the list. So, the median is 9, which is not in the list, but 9 is the mode, which is in the list. Hmm, that can't be. So, maybe the median is not 9, but another number.

Wait, no, the mode is 9. The median is a positive integer, not in the list, but it's also the average of two middle numbers. Wait, maybe the median is another number. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the median is not 9. Let me clarify:

Suppose the list has an even number of elements. Let's say 2k elements. The median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. For this average to be an integer not present in the list, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer, but that integer is not in the list.

So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer not in the list (assuming 9 isn't in the list). But wait, the mode is 9, which is in the list because it's the most frequent. So that's a conflict because if the median is 9, which is not in the list, but mode is 9, which is in the list. That seems impossible. So, perhaps the median is another number.

Wait, maybe the median is 8, and the two middle numbers average to 8. For example, 7 and 9: average is 8. So, if 8 is the median, which is not in the list, but 9 is the mode, which is in the list. That might work.

Wait, but then 9 is the mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, in that case, the list has multiple 9s, and the median is 8, which is not in the list. Let me try to structure the list.

Alternatively, maybe the list has an odd number of elements, but that would make the median the middle number, which is in the list. But the problem says the median is not in the list, so it must have an even number of elements. So, the list length is even.

So, let's say the list has 2k elements. The median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. So, that average is an integer, say m, which is not in the list. And the mode is 9, which is in the list. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number.

Let me try to find such a list. Let's consider the smallest possible list with even number of elements. Let's see.

Case 1: List length is 2.

But a list with 2 elements: sum is 30. So, numbers a and b, a + b =30. The median is (a + b)/2 =15. So, median is 15, which is not in the list. Mode is 9, but in a list of two numbers, both have to be 9 for it to be the mode. But 9+9=18 ≠30. So, this is impossible.

So, list length cannot be 2.

Case 2: List length is 4.

So, four numbers. Let's arrange them in non-decreasing order: a, b, c, d. Sum is 30. The median is (b + c)/2, which must be an integer not in the list. The mode is 9, which must appear more than any other number. So, 9 has to appear at least twice.

So, let's think. To have 9 as the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if there are two 9s, the other numbers can appear at most once. If there are three 9s, others can appear at most twice, but since we only have four numbers, let's see.

Wait, if the list has four numbers, and 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's see:

If the list has two 9s: a, b, c, d. Let's say two of them are 9s. The median is (b + c)/2, which should be an integer not in the list.

So, let's arrange the list with two 9s. Let's assume the list is [x, y, 9, 9]. But wait, no, the list is arranged in non-decreasing order. So, x ≤ y ≤9 ≤9. So, x and y are ≤9.

Wait, but the median is (y +9)/2, which has to be an integer not in the list.

Let me suppose that (y +9)/2 = m, where m is an integer not in the list.

So, y = 2m -9.

Since y must be ≤9, 2m -9 ≤9 → 2m ≤18 → m ≤9.

Also, since y must be ≥x, which is ≥1, so y ≥1.

So, 2m -9 ≥1 → 2m ≥10 → m ≥5.

So, possible m values are integers from 5 to 9.

But m should not be in the list. The list has elements x, y, 9, 9.

So, m can't be x, y, or 9.

So, possible m: 5, 6, 7, 8.

But let's see:

If m=5:

Then y=2*5 -9=10-9=1.

So, x ≤ y=1, so x=1.

So the list is [1,1,9,9]. Let's check.

Sum:1+1+9+9=20. But we need sum 30. So, this is too low.

If m=6:

y=2*6 -9=12-9=3.

So, x ≤3. Let's take x as 3, to maximize x.

So list is [3,3,9,9]. Sum is 3+3+9+9=24. Still less than 30.

If m=7:

y=2*7 -9=14-9=5.

x ≤5. Let's take x=5.

List: [5,5,9,9]. Sum=5+5+9+9=28. Close to 30, but not quite.

Wait, maybe x is less than 5. Let's try x=4
