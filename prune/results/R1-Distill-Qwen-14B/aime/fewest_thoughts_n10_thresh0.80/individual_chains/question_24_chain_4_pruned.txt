Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. I have to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let me think about each property one by one.

Starting with the first one: the sum is 30. So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them all up, they should equal 30.

Second property: the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently, and it's unique, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. So all other numbers in the list can appear at most as many times as 9 minus one.

Third property: the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Wait, the median is a positive integer, which makes sense because all the numbers are positive integers, but it specifically doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting. So if I have an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, and if it's even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But the median here must be an integer that's not in the list. So that might mean that the two middle numbers average to something not in the list.

Let me try to visualize the list. Let's denote the number of elements in the list as n. Since the median is a positive integer, n can be either odd or even.

Wait, but the median for even n is the average of two middle numbers. So if the median is an integer, that average has to be an integer, which means the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd. Because if they are both even, their sum is even; if both odd, sum is even. So that's a key point.

But also, the median is not present in the list. So for example, if n is odd, the middle element is the median, which must not be present. But wait, if the median is the middle element, it's part of the list, so that can't
