Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention the probability will be m/n, with m and n coprime, and we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better. A regular octagon has 8 sides, so 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue. The colorings are independent, each with a 50% chance. 

We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation (by some multiple of 45 degrees, since 360/8=45) such that when we apply that rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, the blue vertices are mapped to the red ones, and the red ones, presumably, are mapped to blue.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so rotating it doesn't change the structure. So, after rotation, each blue vertex moves to a new position, and we want all those new positions to have been red before the rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about finding a rotation such that the set of blue vertices is mapped to the set of red vertices. So, the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

But maybe it's better to think in terms of the colorings. So, each vertex is colored red or blue. Let’s denote the color of the i-th vertex as c_i, where c_i is 0 for red and 1 for blue, or something like that.

We need to have a rotation r such that for every vertex i, c_{r(i)} is red (originally) if c_i is blue. Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, no: after rotating, the blue vertex moves to a position that was red. So, the color after rotation is such that blue is mapped to red.

Wait, perhaps more precisely: for each vertex i, if c_i is blue, then after applying rotation r, the new position of i is r(i), and c_{r(i)} (original) is red. So, the condition is that for all i, if c_i is blue, then c_{r(i)} is red. Alternatively, the set of blue vertices is a subset of the red vertices under rotation r^{-1}.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think of the colorings as binary vectors of length 8, and rotations as cyclic permutations. We need that the set of blue vertices is a cyclic shift (by some rotation) of the set of red vertices. But that might not be the case, since the number of red and blue vertices could vary.

Wait, no. Wait, the octagon has 8 vertices. If we have a rotation r such that all blue vertices are mapped to red ones, then the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you rotate the octagon so that every blue vertex moves to a red position, then the set of blue vertices is the image under r^{-1} of the red set. So, the blue set is r^{-1}(red set), which means the red set is r(blue set).

But wait, the number of red and blue vertices must be the same, right? Because if you rotate the blue set to the red set, their sizes must match. So, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. Which is only possible if exactly 4 are blue and 4 are red. Because 8 is even, so 4 and 4. So, the first thing I should note is that only colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices can satisfy the condition. Because otherwise, you can't have a bijection between blue and red vertices via rotation.

So, this problem is only possible when there are exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. So, the total number of colorings with 4 blue and 4 red is C(8,4) = 70. But wait, the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256. So, the probability we're looking for is the number of favorable colorings (with exactly 4 blue and 4 red, and satisfying the rotation condition) divided by 256. But wait, no: the problem says each vertex is colored red or blue with equal probability, regardless of the number of red and blue. So, the condition is that there exists a rotation that maps blue to red, irrespective of the counts. But wait, if the counts don't match, can you have such a rotation?

Wait, let's think again. If the number of blue vertices is not equal to the number of red vertices, then how could a rotation map all blue vertices to red ones? Because the rotation would have to map each blue vertex to a unique red vertex. So, if there are more blue vertices than red, that's impossible. Similarly, if there are more red than blue, it's also impossible because you can't map blue to red if there aren't enough reds.

So, the only colorings where such a rotation exists are those where the number of blue vertices equals the number of red vertices, which is 4 each. So, the total number of possible colorings is C(8,4) = 70. Now, among these 70, we need to count how many have the property that there exists a rotation mapping blue vertices to red vertices.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to model this problem in terms of group actions. The octagon's rotations form a group of order 8, cyclic group C8. The problem is about colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set, which is equivalent to the blue set being equal to the red set under some rotation.

Wait, but each coloring has exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. So, the blue set is a subset of 4 vertices, and the red set is its complement. We need to find colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the blue set is equal to the red set under some rotation. So, the blue set is a rotated version of the red set, which is the same as saying that the blue set is a shifted version of the red set.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue set is a cyclic permutation of the red set. So, in other words, the blue and red sets are related by a rotation.

So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets S of size 4 in the octagon such that S is a rotation of its complement. So, the question reduces to counting such subsets S.

Wait, but how many such subsets are there?

Wait, perhaps the number is equal to the number of orbits under rotation that fix the subset and its complement.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this using Burnside's lemma or something similar.

But let's think without group theory first. Let's consider the possible rotational symmetries. The octagon can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, so 8 possible rotations.

For a given coloring, how many rotations would map the blue set to the red set? That is, how many rotations r such that r(S) = S', where S is the blue set and S' is the red set. But since S' is the complement of S, we have r(S) = S' = V \ S, where V is the set of all vertices.

So, for a given S, the number of such rotations r is equal to the number of rotations that satisfy r(S) = V \ S.

So, for such an S, the set S must be invariant under rotation by r, but also map to its complement. So, for each rotation r, if S is a subset such that r(S) = V \ S, then S is what's called a "dihedral complement" for that rotation.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think of S as a set that is mapped to its complement under some rotation.

So, for each possible rotation r, how many subsets S satisfy r(S) = V \ S?

Let’s consider the rotations. The identity rotation (0°) would require S = V \ S, which means S is equal to its complement, which implies that S has size 4, which is the case here. So, for identity rotation, any subset S of size 4 would satisfy r(S) = S, but to have S = V \ S, we must have S = V \ S, which is only possible if S is exactly half of V, which is size 4. So, for identity, any subset of size 4 would satisfy r(S) = S, but S = V \ S only if S is equal to its complement, which is always true because S is the complement of V \ S. Wait, no: for identity, r(S) = S. So, if we require that r(S) = V \ S, then S must equal V \ S, which is only possible if S is equal to its complement, which is possible only if |S| = |V|/2. Which in this case, |V|=8, so |S|=4. So, any subset S of size 4 satisfies identity(S) = S, but to have S = V \ S, we must have S = V \ S, which is always true if S is size 4. Wait, no: for example, if S is the set {1,2,3,4}, then V \ S is {5,6,7,8}. So, S is not equal to V \ S unless the subset is arranged symmetrically in some way.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

We can model the problem as: for a subset S of size 4, does there exist a rotation r such that r(S) = V \ S?

Each such S would correspond to a coloring where the blue set is S and the red set is V \ S. So, the condition is that there exists a rotation that maps S to its complement.

So, the number of such subsets S is equal to the number of 4-element subsets S of V such that there exists a rotation r where r(S) = V \ S.

Now, each rotation r can be represented as a shift by k positions, where k is 0,1,2,...,7. Because a regular octagon can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, etc., which correspond to shifting the vertices by 0,1,2,...,7 positions respectively.

So, for a given S, we need to check if there's some k such that shifting S by k positions gives V \ S.

Alternatively, S shifted by k positions is the complement of S.

So, for each S, we can check if any shift of S is equal to its complement.

Let me think about how to count the number of such S.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that S and its complement are related by a rotation. So, S is a subset such that it is a rotation of its complement. So, S is a "complemented rotation."

I think the number of such subsets is equal to the number of orbits under the rotation group where S is mapped to its complement. But perhaps using Burnside's lemma could help.

Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group actions.

Wait, but in this case, the group is acting on the subsets S of size 4, and we want to count the number of subsets S such that there exists a group element (rotation) that maps S to its complement. So, perhaps the number of such subsets is equal to the number of orbits under the group action where each orbit consists of subsets that are rotations of each other, but in our case, we need S to be a rotation of its complement.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let's consider that for S to be a rotation of its complement, then the subset S must be such that S is a rotation of V \ S. So, the subset S is a rotation of its complement. Which implies that the subset S is a "symmetric" subset under some rotation.

Let me think about the possible rotational symmetries. The octagon can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°, which are the elements of the cyclic group C8.

So, for each rotation r, we can consider how many subsets S of size 4 satisfy r(S) = V \ S.

Let me consider each possible rotation and compute how many subsets S satisfy r(S) = V \ S.

First, for the identity rotation (k=0). Then, r(S) = S, so S must equal V \ S, which is only possible if S = V \ S. But S is a subset of size 4, and V has size 8, so V \ S also has size 4. So, S = V \ S only if S is equal to its complement. Which is only possible if S is a self-complementary subset.

How many 4-element subsets S of an 8-element set V satisfy S = V \ S? Well, actually, S can never equal V \ S unless S is equal to its complement, which is only possible if S is exactly half the size of V, which it is here. But wait, for a general set, S and V \ S are complements, but they are equal only if S is exactly half the set. But in this case, since 8 is even, and 4 is half, S can be equal to V \ S only if S is a self-complementary subset. So, how many such subsets are there? The number of self-complementary 4-element subsets of an 8-element set.

Wait, but for a set of size 8, the number of self-complementary subsets is C(8,4)/2^3 = 140/8 = 17.5, which doesn't make sense because the number must be integer. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it differently. For a set to be self-complementary, it must partition the set into two equal parts where each part is the complement of the other. But this is trivially true for any subset S, because S and V \ S are always complements. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, S is equal to its complement only if every element is in S if and only if it's not in S, which is impossible unless the set is empty. So, actually, no 4-element subset S can satisfy S = V \ S, because that would require every element to be both in S and not in S, which is impossible. So, for the identity rotation, there are zero subsets S such that r(S) = V \ S.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So, for the identity rotation, there are no subsets S of size 4 such that r(S) = V \ S. Because S can't equal its complement unless it's empty or the entire set, neither of which is the case here.

So, moving on to the next rotation: rotation by 45 degrees, which is a shift by 1 position. Let's denote this rotation as r1.

We need to find the number of subsets S of size 4 such that r1(S) = V \ S.

Similarly, for each rotation r_k, which shifts by k positions, we need to find the number of subsets S such that r_k(S) = V \ S.

Now, for a rotation r_k, the condition r_k(S) = V \ S implies that S is a subset that is shifted by k positions to its complement.

Let me model this as: S shifted by k positions is equal to V \ S. So, for each k, we can model this as S + k = V \ S, where +k denotes the shift by k positions.

Wait, but how can we count such subsets S?

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the entire set as a cyclic group Z8, where each vertex is labeled 0 through 7. Then, a subset S is a subset of Z8, and r_k(S) is the set {s + k mod 8 | s ∈ S}.

So, the condition is r_k(S) = V \ S, which is equivalent to S + k = V \ S.

Which can be rewritten as S + 2k = V, because if S + k = V \ S, then adding k again would give S + 2k = V. Because:

S + k = V \ S

=> (S + k) + k = V \ S + k

=> S + 2k = V \ S + k

But V \ S + k is the same as (V + k) \ (S + k), but since V is the entire set, V + k is V. So, V \ S + k is V \ (S + k). Wait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a system of equations.

If S + k = V \ S, then for every element x in S, x + k must be in V \ S. So, x + k is not in S. Similarly, for every element y in V \ S, y + k must be in S.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider that S is a subset of size 4. So, S + k must also be a subset of size 4, as it's just a shift. And S + k must equal V \ S. So, the size of S + k is 4, and V \ S is also size 4, so that's consistent.

Moreover, S ∩ (S + k) must be empty because S and V \ S are complements. So, S and S + k must be disjoint.

Wait, but the size of S is 4, and size of S + k is 4, and they are disjoint. So, together, S and S + k would cover 8 elements, which is the entire set V. So, S ∪ (S + k) = V, and S ∩ (S +k) = empty set.

Which implies that S is a subset such that S +k is its complement. So, the condition is that S and S +k are complements.

So, for each k, we can find the number of subsets S of size 4 such that S +k = V \ S.

So, for each k, how many such S exist?

Wait, perhaps for each k, the number of such subsets S is either 0 or 1, depending on whether k is even or not. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, let's think about the case when k=1. How many subsets S of size 4 are there such that S +1 = V \ S.

Each element x in S must satisfy x+1 not in S, and each element y not in S must satisfy y+1 in S.

So, let's model this as a graph. Each element x in S must have x+1 not in S, and each element y not in S must have y+1 in S.

This is equivalent to S being a subset where no two consecutive elements are in S, and every element not in S has its successor in S.

Wait, but that's a bit conflicting. Let me try to think of it as a binary string of length 8, with 4 ones (representing S) and 4 zeros (complement). The condition is that for each 1 in the string, the next position (mod 8) is 0, and for each 0, the next position is 1.

Wait, that sounds like the string must alternate 1 and 0. But that's only possible if the number of 1s equals the number of 0s, which is 4 each, and the arrangement is 1,0,1,0,... or 0,1,0,1,...

But in that case, the only such subsets S would be the sets where the elements are every other vertex, either starting at 0 or 1.

So, for example, S could be {0, 2, 4, 6}, or {1, 3, 5, 7}.

Wait, for k=1, the condition is that S +1 = V \ S. So, let's check with S = {0,2,4,6}. Then S +1 = {1,3,5,7}, which is indeed V \ S. So that works. Similarly, S = {1,3,5,7} would have S +1 = {2,4,6,0}, which is V \ S. So, for k=1, there are exactly 2 subsets S of size 4 that satisfy S +1 = V \ S.

Similarly, for k=2, let's see. So, S +2 = V \ S.

In this case, each element x in S must satisfy x+2 not in S, and each y not in S must satisfy y+2 in S.

So, let's model this. Let me try to find such a subset S.

We need S to satisfy that for every x in S, x + 2 is not in S, and for every y not in S, y + 2 is in S.

This would imply that the subset S must be such that every element in S is at least 2 apart from any other element in S, and every element not in S is followed by an element in S.

Wait, perhaps the only such subsets are those where the elements are spaced two apart. Let me try S = {0, 2, 4, 6}. Then S +2 = {2,4,6,0}, which is S itself. But we need S +2 = V \ S, which would be {1,3,5,7}. But S +2 is {2,4,6,0}, which is not equal to {1,3,5,7}. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's try S = {0,3,6,1}. Wait, no, that might not satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, maybe no such subset exists for k=2. Let me see.

Suppose S +2 = V \ S.

So, for each x in S, x +2 is not in S, and for each y not in S, y +2 is in S.

So, if I have x in S, then x+2 not in S. But since S has 4 elements, perhaps I can arrange them so that adding 2 wraps around and doesn't include any of the elements.

Wait, but in an 8-element set, adding 2 four times brings you back. Let's see. Let me try S = {0, 2, 4, 6}.

Then S +2 = {2,4,6,0}, which is the same as S. So, S +2 = S, which would imply that S = V \ S, which would require S = V \ S, which is impossible unless S is empty or the entire set, which it's not. So, that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe S = {0,1,2,3}, but that's 4 consecutive elements. Then S +2 would be {2,3,4,5}, which is not the complement of S. The complement of S would be {4,5,6,7}, so that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe S = {0,1,4,5}. Then S +2 would be {2,3,6,7}, which is indeed V \ S. So, that works.

Wait, let me check: S = {0,1,4,5}, then V \ S = {2,3,6,7}. Now, S +2 = {0+2=2, 1+2=3, 4+2=6, 5+2=7} = {2,3,6,7}, which is exactly V \ S. So that works.

Similarly, is there another subset? Let me try S = {0,1,5,6}. Then S +2 = {2,3,7,0}. But V \ S would be {2,3,4,7}. So, that's not equal to S +2. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe another subset. Let me try S = {0,2,5,7}. Then S +2 = {2,4,7,1}. V \ S is {1,3,4,6}. So, S +2 is {1,2,4,7}, which is not equal to V \ S. So, that doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe there's only one such subset for k=2. Wait, earlier I found S = {0,1,4,5} works. Let me check another one.

What about S = {1,2,5,6}? Then S +2 = {3,4,7,0} = {0,3,4,7}. V \ S is {0,3,4,7}, which is exactly S +2. So, that also works.

So, for k=2, there are at least two subsets S that satisfy S +2 = V \ S. Wait, but wait: when I took S = {0,1,4,5}, S +2 = {2,3,6,7} = V \ S. Similarly, S = {1,2,5,6}, S +2 = {3,4,7,0} = V \ S. So, that's two subsets for k=2.

Wait, but wait, could there be more? Let's see. How about S = {2,3,6,7}? Then S +2 = {4,5,0,1} = V \ S. So, that's another one. Similarly, S = {3,4,7,0}, then S +2 = {5,6,1,2} = V \ S.

So, for k=2, the number of such subsets S is actually 4. Because each shift by 2 positions, there are two possible subsets in each pair of positions. Wait, perhaps not. Wait, no, when I took S = {0,1,4,5}, then S +2 = {2,3,6,7}, which is V \ S. Similarly, S = {1,2,5,6}, S +2 = {3,4,7,0} = V \ S. Similarly, S = {2,3,6,7}, S +2 = {4,5,0,1} = V \ S. S = {3,4,7,0}, S +2 = {5,6,1,2} = V \ S. So, that's four subsets for k=2.

Wait, but earlier I thought for k=1, there were two subsets. So, maybe for each k, the number of subsets S that satisfy S +k = V \ S depends on the value of k and the greatest common divisor of k and 8.

Hmm, perhaps the number of such subsets is 2 when the rotation is by a step that's relatively prime to 8, and 4 when it's not? Or maybe something else.

Wait, let's check for k=3. So, rotation by 3 positions. How many subsets S of size 4 satisfy S +3 = V \ S.

So, let me try to find such subsets.

Let me try S = {0,1,2,3}. Then S +3 = {3,4,5,6}. V \ S is {4,5,6,7}, which is not equal to S +3. So, that doesn't work.

Let me try S = {0,1,4,5}. Then S +3 = {3,4,7,0}. V \ S is {2,3,6,7}. So, S +3 is {0,3,4,7}, which is not equal to V \ S. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe a different approach. Let's model this as a graph where each element x in S must have x+3 not in S, and each y not in S must have y+3 in S.

So, for each x in S, x+3 is not in S, and for each y not in S, y+3 is in S.

So, let's attempt to construct such a subset S. Let's pick an element, say 0. If 0 is in S, then 3 cannot be in S. Then, since 0 is in S, 0+3=3 must not be in S. Then, since 3 is not in S, 3+3=6 must be in S. So, 6 is in S. Then, since 6 is in S, 6+3=9 mod 8 is 1 must not be in S. So, 1 is not in S. Then, since 1 is not in S, 1+3=4 must be in S. So, 4 is in S. Now, since 4 is in S, 4+3=7 must not be in S. So, 7 is not in S. Then, since 7 is not in S, 7+3=10 mod 8 is 2 must be in S. So, 2 is in S. But wait, we only have 4 elements in S. Let me see:

So far, S = {0,6,4,2}. Let me check if this works.

S = {0,2,4,6}. Then S +3 = {3,5,7,1}. V \ S is {1,3,5,7}, which is indeed equal to S +3. So, yes, this works.

Alternatively, let's try starting with 1. If 1 is in S, then 4 cannot be in S. Since 1 is in S, 1+3=4 is not in S. Then, since 4 is not in S, 4+3=7 must be in S. So, 7 is in S. Now, since 7 is in S, 7+3=10 mod 8=2 must not be in S. So, 2 is not in S. Then, since 2 is not in S, 2+3=5 must be in S. So, 5 is in S. Now, since 5 is in S, 5+3=8 mod 8=0 must not be in S. But 0 is in S as per our initial selection. So, that's a contradiction. So, this path doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps another way. Let's try S = {1,3,5,7}. Then S +3 = {4,6,0,2}, which is V \ S. Yes, that works. So, that's another subset.

So, for k=3, the subsets S that satisfy S +3 = V \ S are {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}. So, two subsets.

Wait, earlier for k=1, I had two subsets, and for k=3, which is coprime with 8, I also have two subsets.

Similarly, for k=5 and k=7, which are also coprime with 8, perhaps each has two subsets.

Wait, let me check for k=5. So, S +5 = V \ S.

If I take S = {0,2,4,6}, then S +5 = {5,7,1,3}, which is V \ S, so that works. Similarly, S = {1,3,5,7}, then S +5 = {6,0,2,4}, which is V \ S. So, two subsets for k=5.

Similarly, for k=7, which is equivalent to k=-1 mod 8. So, S +7 = V \ S.

Let me take S = {0,2,4,6}. S +7 = {7,1,3,5}, which is V \ S. Similarly, S = {1,3,5,7}, S +7 = {0,2,4,6} = V \ S. So, again two subsets.

Now, for k=4, which is a rotation by 180 degrees. Let's see how many subsets S satisfy S +4 = V \ S.

So, for each x in S, x +4 must be in V \ S. So, x+4 cannot be in S. Similarly, for each y not in S, y +4 must be in S.

Let me try to construct such a subset S.

Let's pick 0 in S. Then, 4 cannot be in S. Then, since 4 is not in S, 4 +4=8 mod 8=0 must be in S, which it is. Now, pick 1 in S. Then, 5 cannot be in S. Since 5 is not in S, 5 +4=9 mod 8=1 must be in S, which it is. Similarly, pick 2 in S. Then, 6 cannot be in S. Since 6 is not in S, 6 +4=10 mod 8=2 must be in S, which it is. Similarly, pick 3 in S. Then, 7 cannot be in S. Since 7 is not in S, 7 +4=11 mod8=3 must be in S, which it is.

Wait, but this would require S to be {0,1,2,3}, but S +4 is {4,5,6,7} which is V \ S. So, yes, that works. Similarly, S could be {4,5,6,7}, then S +4 is {0,1,2,3} = V \ S. So, that's two subsets.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought for k=4, there might be more subsets. Let me see.

Alternatively, what if S is a subset where each element x is paired with x+4 not in S. So, perhaps S can be any subset where elements are paired across the 4 positions apart. So, S could consist of two pairs of elements, each pair separated by 4 positions.

Wait, for example, S = {0,1,4,5}. Then S +4 = {4,5,0,1}, which is S itself, so that's not equal to V \ S. Because V \ S would be {2,3,6,7}, which is different.

Wait, but earlier I found that S = {0,1,2,3} works because S +4 = V \ S. Similarly, S = {4,5,6,7} also works.

Are there any other subsets for k=4?

Let me try S = {0,2,4,6}. Then S +4 = {4,6,0,2} = S. So, S +4 = S, which would imply that S = V \ S, which is only possible if S is empty or entire set, which it's not. So, that doesn't work.

Similarly, S = {1,3,5,7}, S +4 = {5,7,1,3} = S. So, same issue.

So, for k=4, only two subsets S satisfy S +4 = V \ S: {0,1,2,3} and {4,5,6,7}.

So, summarizing:

- For k=0: 0 subsets
- For k=1: 2 subsets
- For k=2: 4 subsets
- For k=3: 2 subsets
- For k=4: 2 subsets
- For k=5: 2 subsets
- For k=6: same as k=2, so 4 subsets
- For k=7: same as k=1, so 2 subsets

Wait, wait. Let me check for k=6.

k=6 is equivalent to shifting by 6 positions, which is the same as shifting by -2 positions. So, for k=6, S +6 = V \ S.

Let me try S = {0,1,4,5}. Then S +6 = {6,7,2,3} = V \ S. So, that works. Similarly, S = {2,3,6,7}, S +6 = {0,1,4,5} = V \ S. So, that's two subsets. Wait, no, earlier for k=2, I had four subsets. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, when k=2, the subsets were {0,1,4,5}, {1,2,5,6}, {2,3,6,7}, {3,4,7,0}, each of which when shifted by 2 positions gives the complement.

Similarly, for k=6, which is equivalent to shifting by -2, perhaps the same subsets would satisfy the condition. But when I checked S = {0,1,4,5}, shifting by 6 gives {6,7,2,3}, which is V \ S. Similarly, shifting S = {2,3,6,7} by 6 gives {0,1,4,5} = V \ S. So, that's two subsets. So, perhaps for k=6, there are two subsets.

Wait, but earlier I thought for k=2 there were four subsets. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting for k=2.

Wait, earlier for k=2, I found S = {0,1,4,5}, {1,2,5,6}, {2,3,6,7}, {3,4,7,0}, each of which when shifted by 2 positions gives their complements. So, that's four subsets. So, for k=2 and k=6, each has four subsets.

Wait, but when I tried for k=6, I found that the same subsets as for k=2 also satisfy the condition, but perhaps I'm missing some.

Wait, perhaps for each rotation k and its inverse rotation (like k and 8 -k), they have the same number of subsets. So, for k=2 and k=6, which are inverses, perhaps each has four subsets.

But earlier, when I tried k=2, I found four subsets, and for k=6, I found two, but that might not be correct. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph. Each element x must be in S if and only if x +k is not in S. So, for each rotation k, the number of valid subsets S is either 0 or 2^{gcd(k,8)}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count the total number of S subsets for each k and then use Burnside's lemma to find the total number of distinct S that satisfy the condition for some k.

Wait, so each rotation k can contribute some number of subsets S. But we have to be careful not to double-count subsets that satisfy the condition for multiple ks.

Wait, but let's first calculate the total number of ordered pairs (k, S) where S is a 4-element subset and r_k(S) = V \ S.

From earlier:

- k=0: 0
- k=1: 2
- k=2: 4
- k=3: 2
- k=4: 2
- k=5: 2
- k=6: 4
- k=7: 2

So, total is 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 20.

Now, each subset S can be counted multiple times if it satisfies the condition for multiple ks. So, the total number of distinct subsets S that satisfy the condition for at least one k is less than or equal to 20.

But how many distinct S are there?

Wait, let's see:

From k=1, we have two subsets: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}.

From k=2, four subsets: {0,1,4,5}, {1,2,5,6}, {2,3,6,7}, {3,4,7,0}.

From k=3, two subsets: same as k=1.

From k=4, two subsets: {0,1,2,3}, {4,5,6,7}.

From k=5, same as k=3.

From k=6, same as k=2.

From k=7, same as k=1.

Wait, so the distinct subsets S are:

From k=1 and k=7: two subsets.

From k=2 and k=6: four subsets.

From k=3 and k=5: two subsets.

From k=4: two subsets.

So, total distinct subsets would be 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 10.

Wait, but let me check if any subsets are counted more than once. For example, does any subset satisfy the condition for more than one k?

Let me check S = {0,1,4,5}:

- For k=2, S +2 = {2,3,6,7} = V \ S.
- For k=6, S +6 = {6,7,2,3} = V \ S. So, yes, this subset is counted for both k=2 and k=6.

Similarly, S = {1,2,5,6} is counted for both k=2 and k=6.

Similarly, S = {2,3,6,7}, same thing.

S = {3,4,7,0}, same.

So, the four subsets from k=2 and k=6 are the same four subsets.

Similarly, S = {0,2,4,6} is counted for k=1 and k=7.

Similarly, S = {1,3,5,7} is counted for k=1 and k=7.

Now, the subsets from k=4 are {0,1,2,3} and {4,5,6,7}, which are unique.

The subsets from k=3 and k=5 are the same as from k=1 and k=7.

So, the total number of distinct subsets S that satisfy the condition for some rotation is:

- From k=1,7: 2 subsets
- From k=2,6: 4 subsets
- From k=3,5: 2 subsets
- From k=4: 2 subsets

So, 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 10 subsets.

Wait, but earlier, when I calculated the total number of (k, S) pairs as 20, and each of these 10 subsets is counted twice (except for those counted once, like the ones from k=4). Let me check:

- The two subsets from k=1 and k=7 are each counted twice (once for k=1, once for k=7).
- The four subsets from k=2 and k=6 are each counted twice.
- The two subsets from k=3 and k=5 are each counted twice.
- The two subsets from k=4 are each counted once.

So, total count is:

2*2 (from k=1 and 7) + 4*2 (from k=2 and 6) + 2*2 (from k=3 and 5) + 2*1 (from k=4) = 4 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 18. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 20. Maybe my initial count was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting how many subsets each k contributes.

Wait, from my earlier count:

k=0: 0

k=1: 2

k=2:4

k=3:2

k=4:2

k=5:2

k=6:4

k=7:2

So, total is 2+4+2+2+2+4+2 = 18.

Ah, I see. So, the total is 18, not 20. So, the 10 subsets would be counted:

- From k=1 and k=7: 2 subsets each counted twice → 4
- From k=2 and k=6: 4 subsets each counted twice → 8
- From k=3 and k=5: 2 subsets each counted twice → 4
- From k=4: 2 subsets each counted once → 2
Total: 4 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 18, which matches.

So, the 10 subsets are:

- 2 from k=1 and k=7
- 4 from k=2 and k=6
- 2 from k=3 and k=5
- 2 from k=4

Wait, no, the 2 from k=4 are unique, not overlapping with others.

Wait, so the 10 subsets consist of:

- 2 subsets that work for k=1 and k=7
- 4 subsets that work for k=2 and k=6
- 2 subsets that work for k=3 and k=5
- 2 subsets that work only for k=4

So, total 10 subsets.

So, the number of favorable subsets S is 10.

Now, the total number of colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices is C(8,4) = 70.

So, the probability that a randomly colored octagon (with exactly 4 blue and 4 red) satisfies the condition is 10 / 70 = 1/7.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices."

But not all colorings have exactly 4 blue and 4 red. Some have 0,1,2,...,8 blue vertices.

But earlier, I thought that only colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red can satisfy the condition because otherwise, you can't map blue to red in a one-to-one fashion.

So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Out of these, only the colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red can satisfy the condition. So, the probability is (number of favorable colorings) / 256.

But wait, the favorable colorings are those where there exists a rotation r such that r(blue set) = red set. Which implies that the blue set is a rotation of the red set, which is the same as saying the blue set is a rotation of its complement.

So, the number of such colorings is 2 * number of such subsets S, because for each subset S, the coloring can have S as blue and its complement as red, or vice versa.

Wait, but no, because the condition is that the blue set is a rotation of the red set. So, for each such subset S, the coloring where S is blue and V\S is red is favorable. Similarly, the coloring where V\S is blue and S is red is also favorable because then the rotation would map the blue set (V\S) to the red set S.

Wait, but in our earlier count, each subset S is counted once, but for each such S, there are two colorings: one where S is blue and the other where S is red. So, perhaps the number of favorable colorings is 2 * 10 = 20.

Wait, but let me think again. If a subset S satisfies that there exists a rotation r such that r(S) = V \ S, then the coloring where S is blue and V \ S is red is favorable, and the coloring where V \ S is blue and S is red is also favorable because applying the same rotation r would map V \ S to S, which is red.

Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, no, because if S is blue and V \ S is red, then applying rotation r maps S to V \ S, which is red. So that works. Similarly, if V \ S is blue and S is red, then applying rotation r would map V \ S to S, which is red. So, yes, both colorings (S as blue and V\S as red, and V\S as blue and S as red) are favorable.

But wait, in our earlier count, each subset S is counted once, but for each S, both colorings (S as blue and V\S as red, and vice versa) satisfy the condition. So, the number of favorable colorings is 2 * 10 = 20.

Wait, but wait, in our earlier analysis for each k, each S was counted once for each rotation that maps S to its complement. So, if a subset S is counted in multiple k's, does that affect the count?

Alternatively, perhaps for each S that satisfies the condition, there are two colorings: one where S is blue and the other where S is red. So, number of favorable colorings is 2 * number of such S subsets.

Since we found 10 such subsets S, the number of favorable colorings is 20.

So, the probability is 20 / 256 = 5 / 64.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that the number of such subsets S is 10, so the number of favorable colorings is 20. But let me double-check.

Because for each subset S, if it satisfies the condition, then both colorings (S blue and V\S red, and V\S blue and S red) are favorable. So, yes, 20 colorings.

So, the probability is 20 / 256 = 5 / 64. So, m=5, n=64, m+n=69.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I considered the number of subsets S as 10, each contributing two colorings, that would give 20 colorings. But according to the problem statement, the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime. So, 5/64 is reduced, so m + n is 69.

But wait, I'm getting confused because earlier I thought the number of such subsets S is 10, leading to 20 colorings, but maybe I made a mistake in the count.

Wait, let me recount the number of such subsets S.

Earlier, I found that for each rotation k, the number of subsets S satisfying S +k = V \ S is as follows:

k=0:0

k=1:2

k=2:4

k=3:2

k=4:2

k=5:2

k=6:4

k=7:2

Total over all k: 0+2+4+2+2+2+4+2=18.

But these 18 include duplicates because each subset S can satisfy the condition for multiple k's.

Wait, but how many distinct subsets S are there?

From k=1:2 subsets

From k=2:4 subsets

From k=3:2 subsets

From k=4:2 subsets

But some of these are overlapping. For example, the subsets from k=1 and k=7 are the same.

Wait, let me list all possible subsets S that satisfy the condition for any k.

From k=1 and k=7: S = {0,2,4,6}, {1,3,5,7}

From k=2 and k=6: S = {0,1,4,5}, {1,2,5,6}, {2,3,6,7}, {3,4,7,0}

From k=3 and k=5: same as k=1 and k=7: {0,2,4,6}, {1,3,5,7}

From k=4: S = {0,1,2,3}, {4,5,6,7}

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when k=3, the subsets are different.

Wait, earlier when I checked for k=3, the subsets were {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}, same as for k=1.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, earlier when I considered k=3, I found that S = {0,2,4,6} and S = {1,3,5,7} satisfy S +3 = V \ S.

Similarly, for k=5, same.

So, the subsets from k=1,3,5,7 are the same two subsets.

Similarly, the subsets from k=2 and k=6 are four subsets.

And the subsets from k=4 are two unique subsets.

So, total distinct subsets:

2 (from k=1,3,5,7) + 4 (from k=2,6) + 2 (from k=4) = 8 subsets.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were 10. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, earlier I thought that for k=2 and k=6, there are four subsets each, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, for k=2, I found four subsets S that satisfy S +2 = V \ S:

{0,1,4,5}, {1,2,5,6}, {2,3,6,7}, {3,4,7,0}

Each of these when shifted by 2 gives their complements.

Similarly, for k=6, which is equivalent to shifting by -2, do these same subsets satisfy S +6 = V \ S?

Let me check S = {0,1,4,5}. S +6 = {6,7,2,3} = V \ S. So yes.

Similarly, S = {1,2,5,6}, S +6 = {7,0,3,4} = V \ S.

Similarly, S = {2,3,6,7}, S +6 = {0,1,4,5} = V \ S.

S = {3,4,7,0}, S +6 = {1,2,5,6} = V \ S.

So, yes, these four subsets satisfy the condition for both k=2 and k=6.

So, the distinct subsets from k=2 and k=6 are the same four subsets.

Similarly, the two subsets from k=1,3,5,7 are the same.

And the two subsets from k=4 are unique.

So, total distinct subsets S is 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.

Wait, that's different from my earlier count of 10. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me try to list all the subsets:

From k=1,3,5,7:

S1 = {0,2,4,6}

S2 = {1,3,5,7}

From k=2,6:

S3 = {0,1,4,5}

S4 = {1,2,5,6}

S5 = {2,3,6,7}

S6 = {3,4,7,0}

From k=4:

S7 = {0,1,2,3}

S8 = {4,5,6,7}

So, that's 8 distinct subsets.

Each of these satisfies the condition for some rotation.

So, the number of favorable colorings is 2 * 8 = 16, because each subset S corresponds to two colorings: one where S is blue and the other where S is red.

Wait, but wait, for each subset S, the coloring where S is blue and V\S is red is favorable, and the coloring where V\S is blue and S is red is also favorable because then applying the same rotation would map V\S to S, which is red.

So, for each subset S, there are two colorings. So, with 8 subsets, that's 16 colorings.

So, the probability is 16 / 256 = 1/16.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier count. So, I'm confused.

Wait, let me go back.

If there are 8 distinct subsets S, each contributing two colorings, then 16 colorings are favorable.

But earlier, when I thought there were 10 subsets, I thought 20 colorings. But now, seeing that it's 8 subsets, leading to 16 colorings.

But wait, let me check if each of these 8 subsets indeed corresponds to two colorings.

Yes, for each S, both colorings (S as blue, V\S as red and vice versa) are favorable.

So, 8 subsets * 2 colorings = 16.

So, the probability is 16 / 256 = 1/16.

But this doesn't match my earlier count of 10 subsets.

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in the counting of the subsets S.

Wait, perhaps the correct number of subsets S is 10, but I had an error in my analysis.

Wait, let's think again.

Earlier, I found that for each rotation k, the number of subsets S is as follows:

k=0: 0

k=1:2

k=2:4

k=3:2

k=4:2

k=5:2

k=6:4

k=7:2

Total: 18

But these counts include overlapping subsets for different k's.

So, using Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct subsets S that satisfy the condition for some rotation is equal to (number of fixed points across all group elements) divided by group size.

But Burnside's lemma says the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points per group element.

In this case, the group is C8, and we are looking for the number of orbits of subsets S of size 4 under the group action, where each orbit consists of subsets related by rotation.

But I'm not directly looking for orbits, but rather the number of subsets S that are fixed by some group element in the sense that r_k(S) = V \ S.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a graph where each S is a node, and edges connect S to r_k(S), etc. But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such subsets S is equal to the number of solutions to S +k = V \ S for some k.

Which, as we've seen, is 10 subsets.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to list them, I found 8, but perhaps I missed some.

Wait, perhaps I should try to find all possible subsets S of size 4 that are a rotation of their complement.

Let me think about all possible such subsets.

1. The two subsets that are every other vertex: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}. These are fixed under rotation by 2 positions.

2. The four subsets that are consecutive pairs with a shift of 2: {0,1,4,5}, {1,2,5,6}, {2,3,6,7}, {3,4,7,0}. These are shifted versions of each other under rotation by 2 positions.

3. The two subsets that are four consecutive vertices: {0,1,2,3}, {4,5,6,7}. These are fixed under rotation by 4 positions.

So, that's 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 subsets.

Wait, but I thought earlier that for k=3, the same two subsets as for k=1 were the ones that satisfy the condition. So, perhaps there are no more subsets beyond these 8.

So, perhaps the correct number of subsets S is 8, leading to 16 favorable colorings.

Thus, the probability is 16 / 256 = 1/16.

But I'm not fully confident, as I might have missed some subsets.

Wait, let me think differently. The number of such subsets S where S is a rotation of its complement is equal to the number of "complemented" subsets under rotation. Each such subset S must satisfy S = r_k(V \ S) for some rotation r_k.

In the case of the regular octagon, the only such subsets are the ones I've listed: the two alternating subsets, the four subsets that are unions of two adjacent pairs, and the two subsets that are blocks of four consecutive vertices.

So, 8 subsets in total.

Thus, number of favorable colorings is 2 * 8 = 16.

So, probability is 16 / 256 = 1/16.

Thus, m=1, n=16, m + n=17.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 10 subsets, giving 20 colorings and probability 5/64.

But now, after more careful analysis, I think it's 8 subsets, leading to 16 colorings, giving probability 1/16.

Wait, but let me check with a small example. Let's take the subset S = {0,1,4,5}. As I saw earlier, S +2 = {2,3,6,7} = V \ S. So, that works. Similarly, for k=6, S +6 = {6,7,2,3} = V \ S. So, that's two rotations that map S to its complement.

Similarly, S = {0,2,4,6}: S +1 = {1,3,5,7} = V \ S.

So, each of these subsets is counted for two different rotations.

So, the total number of (k, S) pairs is 16, as earlier:

- For each of the 8 subsets, there are two rotations that map them to their complements.

Wait, but earlier, when I counted the total number of (k, S) pairs as 18, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recount:

k=0:0

k=1:2

k=2:4

k=3:2

k=4:2

k=5:2

k=6:4

k=7:2

Total = 0 + 2 +4 +2 +2 +2 +4 +2 = 18.

Hmm, so 18 (k, S) pairs, but each subset S is counted multiple times.

If there are 8 subsets S, each appearing in 2 or 4 different k's, then 8 * 2.25 = 18, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps:

- The two subsets from k=1,3,5,7 each appear in two ks: 2 subsets * 4 ks = 8 (k, S) pairs.

- The four subsets from k=2,6 each appear in two ks: 4 subsets * 2 ks = 8 (k, S) pairs.

- The two subsets from k=4 each appear in one k: 2 subsets * 1 k = 2 (k, S) pairs.

Total: 8 + 8 + 2 = 18, which matches.

So, the 8 subsets S are:

From k=1,3,5,7: 2 subsets

From k=2,6:4 subsets

From k=4:2 subsets

So, 8 subsets in total.

Thus, the number of favorable colorings is 8 * 2 = 16.

Thus, the probability is 16 / 256 = 1/16.

So, m=1, n=16, m + n=17.

Wait, but the problem says the probability is m/n, reduced. So, 1/16 is already reduced, so m + n=17.

But wait, in the problem statement, the probability is given as m/n, with m and n coprime. So, if the answer is 1/16, then m + n=17.

But wait, earlier I thought the answer was 5/64, but that was based on a miscalculation of the number of subsets.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 1/16, leading to 17.

But I'm not entirely confident, so I'll check again.

Wait, another approach: The number of such subsets S is equal to the number of "complemented" subsets under rotation.

In a regular octagon, the only such subsets are those that are fixed by some rotation and their complements.

These include:

1. The two alternating subsets, which are fixed under 180-degree rotation.

2. The four subsets that consist of two adjacent pairs, which are fixed under 180-degree rotation.

3. The two subsets that are consecutive blocks of four, which are fixed under 180-degree rotation.

Wait, but that adds up to 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 subsets, as before.

Thus, 8 subsets, leading to 16 favorable colorings.

Thus, probability is 16/256=1/16.

So, the answer is 1/16, m + n=1+16=17.


The probability that a randomly colored regular octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices align with original red vertices is $\frac{1}{16}$. Thus, $m+n=1+16=17$.

$\boxed{17}$
