Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So essentially, I have to find the infimum of BD² and then determine the greatest number less than all possible BD².

First, let me recall that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and diagonals that bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, no, I think they are. Let me double-check: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola as well. So the center of the hyperbola is at (0,0), which is also the intersection point of the diagonals of the rhombus.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are arranged such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Moreover, because it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

Let me try to parametrize the points on the hyperbola. Since all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, I can write the coordinates of points A, B, C, D in terms of some parameters.

But since the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, the points A and C are diametrically opposite with respect to the origin, as are B and D. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B would be another point (u, v), and D would be (-u, -v). So, points A, B, C, D can be represented as (x,y), (u,v), (-x,-y), (-u,-v).

But since it's a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, which equals the distance between D and A.

Another approach is to consider the properties of the diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if I can find the slopes of the diagonals, I can enforce that they are perpendicular.

But since the origin is their intersection, and the diagonals are AC and BD, their slopes would be (y)/x for AC, and (v)/u for BD. For them to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1. So, (y*v)/(x*u) = -1.

But since the points are on the hyperbola, we have x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and similarly for u² and v².

Alternatively, maybe it's better to parametrize the points using hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, a common parametrization is (a secθ, b tanθ), but that's for one branch. Alternatively, I can parametrize using hyperbola functions, but maybe using coordinates (
