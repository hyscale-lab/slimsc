Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It means that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300. So, I can think of this as a stars and bars problem, but I also have another condition involving their squares and products.

Looking at the second condition: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a lot. Let me see if I can factor this expression or find a way to simplify it.

I notice that each term is of the form a²b, a²c, etc. Maybe I can factor out something. Let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That looks a bit better.

Wait, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute that in:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So now the equation is:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay, that might help. Let me denote each term as f(a) = a²(300 - a). So the equation becomes f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

So, I need to find all triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000, where f(x) = x²(300 - x).

I wonder if I can find some symmetry or perhaps consider cases where two variables are equal or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe I can find what possible values of a, b, and c could satisfy this condition. Let's think about the function f(x) = x²(300 - x). What does this function look like?

It's a cubic function, and for nonnegative x, it's going to have a maximum somewhere. Let me find the maximum of f(x). Taking derivative for continuous case: f'(x) = 2x(300 - x) + x²(-1) = 600x - 2x² - x² = 600x - 3x². Setting this equal to zero: 600x - 3x² = 0 ⇒ x(600 - 3x) = 0 ⇒ x=0 or x=200.

So the maximum is at x=200. Let me compute f(200): 200²*(300 - 200) = 40000 * 100 = 4,000,000.

Wait, that's interesting. So the maximum value of f(x) is 4,000,000 at x=200.

But in our equation, f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000. Since each f(x) can be up to 4,000,000, but 3*4,000,000 is 12,000,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So maybe the variables can take higher values, but wait, the individual maximum is 4,000,000, so if two variables are 200, that would sum to 8,000,000, which is already more than 6,000,000. Hmm, that might not be possible.

Wait, wait, actually, if a=200, then f(a)=4,000,000. Then the sum of f(b) and f(c) would have to be 2,000,000. Since b + c = 100 (because a + b + c = 300), then the maximum possible for f(b) or f(c) when one of them is 100 would be f(100) = 100²*(200) = 10,000*200=2,000,000. So if one of them is 100, the other is 0.

So, let's see: if a=200, then b + c = 100, and f(b) + f(c) =6,000,000 - 4,000,000 = 2,000,000.

But the maximum that f(b) + f(c) can be is f(100) + f(0) = 2,000,000 + 0 = 2,000,000. So, that's exactly the value we need.

So, if a=200, then b and c must satisfy b + c = 100, and f(b) + f(c) = 2,000,000. Which only occurs when one of them is 100 and the other is 0, because if both are not 100 and 0, their f(b) + f(c) would be less.

Wait, let me check: suppose b=100, c=0: f(b)=2,000,000, f(c)=0. So yes, sum is 2,000,000.

If b=99, c=1: f(99)=99²*(201)=9801*201= let me compute that.

Wait, 9801 * 200 = 1,960,200. Plus 9801 = 1,960,200 + 9,801=1,970,001. Similarly, f(1)=1²*(299)=299. So f(99) + f(1) =1,970,001 +299=1,970,300, which is less than 2,000,000. So yes, only when one is 100 and the other is 0.

Similarly, if b=50, c=50: f(50)=50²*(250)=2500*250=625,000. So two of them sum to 1,250,000, which is less than 2,000,000.

Therefore, the only way for b + c = 100 and f(b) + f(c) =2,000,000 is when one of them is 100 and the other is 0.

So, if a=200, then the possible triples are (200,100,0), (200,0,100). But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and the order matters, so we'd have to consider different permutations.

Wait, but a is fixed at 200, so b and c can be (100,0) or (0,100). So that's two possibilities. Similarly, we can consider cases where a=200, b=200, or c=200.

Wait, wait, no. Because if a=200, then b and c are 100 and 0, but if another variable is 200, say b=200, then a and c would have to be 100 and 0 as well. But since a + b + c =300, if two variables are 200, that would already sum to 400, which is more than 300. So, only one variable can be 200.

Wait, no, because a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so if two variables are 200, the third would have to be -100, which is not allowed. So, only one variable can be 200. So, each of a, b, c can be 200, but not more than one.

So, the possibilities are:

Case 1: a=200, then b + c=100, with one of b or c being 100 and the other 0.

Case 2: b=200, then a + c=100, with one of a or c being 100 and the other 0.

Case 3: c=200, then a + b=100, with one of a or b being 100 and the other 0.

So for each case, we have two triples:

For a=200: (200, 100, 0) and (200, 0, 100).

Similarly, for b=200: (100, 200, 0)
