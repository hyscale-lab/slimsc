Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But wait, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

The product given is over k from 0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity. Each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me try to simplify this expression.

Let me denote each term as f(ω^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x². So, f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Alternatively, I can write this as f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Since we're dealing with a product over all the roots of unity, maybe I can relate this product to evaluating a polynomial at certain points. I remember that for a polynomial P(x), the product over (x - α) where α are the roots of P is equal to P(x). But here, we have a product of f(ω^k). So, perhaps the product is equal to the product of f evaluated at each root of x¹³ - 1 = 0, except when x=1 maybe?

Wait, the product is from k=0 to 12, but when k=0, ω^0 = 1. So, let's compute f(1). Plugging x=1 into f(x): f(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, the term when k=0 is 1. So, the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k).

So, the product becomes f(1) * product_{k=1 to 12} f(ω^k) = 1 * product_{k=1 to 12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Now, I need to compute this product. Maybe I can relate this product to the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at specific points.

Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, the minimal polynomial is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So, any polynomial evaluated at ω will have some cyclotomic properties.

Wait, maybe I can consider the product as evaluating the polynomial f(x) at each of the roots of Φ₁₃(x).
