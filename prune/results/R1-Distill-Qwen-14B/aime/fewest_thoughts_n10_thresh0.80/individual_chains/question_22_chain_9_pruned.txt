Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, let me visualize this hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral, all its sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel, which makes me think of a regular hexagon in terms of parallel sides, but it's not necessarily regular because the sides could be of equal length but the angles might vary. However, in this case, it's given as equilateral, so all sides are equal.

The key here is that the extensions of AB, CD, and EF form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. I need to figure out how this relates to the side length of the hexagon.

Let me recall that in such a hexagon, because opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by three parallelograms. Each pair of opposite sides is part of a parallelogram. So maybe I can model this hexagon as being between three lines, each pair of opposite sides lying on these lines and forming the triangle when extended.

Wait, actually, when you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. So, this triangle is larger than the hexagon and contains it. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, 300. Hmm.

I remember that in such configurations, the hexagon can be considered as a "truncated" triangle, where each side of the triangle has been cut by a line parallel to another side, creating the hexagon. Because the hexagon is equilateral, the truncations must be such that each cut is at the same proportional distance from the original triangle's sides.

Let me think about similar triangles here. If the hexagon is formed by cutting off three corners of the triangle, each cut being parallel to a side, and each cut is at a certain distance from the original triangle. Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the amount we cut off each corner must be the same in some proportional sense.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Then, each side of the hexagon is equal to s, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel.

In this setup, the original triangle is divided into smaller similar triangles at each corner, each similar to the original triangle. The side length of the hexagon would then be related to the difference between the original triangle's sides and these smaller triangles.

But let me think in terms of ratios. Suppose the triangle formed by AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me denote these as a=200, b=240, c=300. Let me check if this is a right triangle. 200^2 + 240^2 = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300^2 is 90000, which is less than 97600, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is scaled by some factor. Wait, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles and the fact that the hexagon's sides are equal.

Another approach: Since all sides of the hexagon are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is a translationally symmetric figure in some way. Maybe the triangle is divided into smaller similar triangles, each corresponding to a corner of the hexagon.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try assigning coordinates to the hexagon.

Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system. Let's say the triangle has vertices at points A', C', E' forming the triangle with sides 200, 240, 300. The hexagon is inside this triangle, with its sides AB, CD, EF lying on lines that are parallel to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, no. The triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF, so the triangle's sides are actually the lines that contain AB, CD, and EF extended.

Wait, that might not be the case. Let me clarify: the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF, meaning that AB, CD, and EF are not the sides of the triangle but their extensions form the triangle.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of the triangle as being the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inscribed within it in such a way that each side of the hexagon is a segment on a line that is parallel to a side of the triangle.

Wait, maybe the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric hexagon, with each pair of opposite sides being equal and parallel. Since it's convex, each internal
