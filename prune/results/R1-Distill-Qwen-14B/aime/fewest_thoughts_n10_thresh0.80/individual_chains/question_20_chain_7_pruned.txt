Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I only need to place some of them. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Also, any additional chip placed would violate these conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let's understand the constraints. Each row must have chips of the same color, right? So for each row, I can either have all white chips, all black chips, or no chips at all. Wait, no, hold on. Because the second condition says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So that means the placement is maximal in some sense. So it's not just any placement where each row and column has the same color, but also that we can't add any more chips without breaking the rules.

So, for each row and column, if we have some chips, they must all be the same color. And once we place them, adding another chip in any row or column that's not already filled would either introduce a different color in that row or column, which isn't allowed.

Wait, perhaps each row and column is either all white, all black, or empty. Because if a row has white chips, then adding a black chip would violate the same row condition. Similarly for columns. So, perhaps the grid is partitioned into some rows and columns that are either all white, all black, or empty, and the intersection of a white row and a black column must be empty, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is the same. But that might not satisfy the condition that any additional chip would break the rule. Because if a row is empty, you could potentially add a chip of a color that doesn't conflict with the columns.

Wait, no. Because if a row is empty, maybe some columns are all white, so if I add a black chip in that row and column, it would conflict with the column's color. So perhaps the only way to place the chips is such that the grid is divided into white and black regions,
