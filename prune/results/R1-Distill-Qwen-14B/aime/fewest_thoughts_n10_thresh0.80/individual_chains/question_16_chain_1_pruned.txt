Okay, so I have this math problem here about prime numbers and divisibility. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared, meaning p² divides n⁴ +1. Then, once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m that satisfies the same condition.

Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I should figure out which primes p satisfy that there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Then, among those primes, find the smallest one, p. After that, find the minimal m such that m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that for primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, there might exist such n. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions. Maybe I should check small primes first.

Let me list the small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let me check each one to see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution.

Starting with p=2. Let's see: We need to find n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 4. Since -1 mod 4 is 3. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4. For any n, n is either 0, 1, or 3 mod 4. Let's compute:

n=1: 1⁴ =1 mod4. Not 3.
n=2: 0 mod4. Not 3.
n=3: 81 mod4, which is 1. Still not 3.

So no solution for p=2.

Next, p=3. We need n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9. Since -1 mod9 is 8. Let me compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1 mod9 → 1
n=2: 16 mod9 =7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: same as 4⁴=256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 → 4
n=5: 5^4=625, 625 /9: 69*9=621, 625-621=4 → 4
Wait, that's same as n=4. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, let's compute each:

n=1: 1
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 0
n=4: 256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 →4
n=5: same as (5 mod9)=5, 5^4=625 mod9: 625-69*9=625-621=4
n=6: 6^4=1296 mod9=0
n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401/9: 266*9=2394, 2401-2394=7 →7
n=8:8^4=4096. 4096/9: 455*9=4095, so 4096 mod9=1.

So the possible quartic residues mod9 are 0,1,4,7. So 8 is not among them. Therefore, no solution for p=3.

Next prime, p=5. Let's check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. Since -1 mod25 is 24.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24. But maybe smarter: Euler's theorem tells us that if n and 25 are coprime, then n^φ(25)=n^20≡1 mod25. So n^4 cycles every 5 steps in exponents, perhaps?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 24, but to find if any of them is 24.

Alternatively, note that n^4 ≡ -1 mod25 implies that n^8 ≡1 mod25. So order of n modulo25 divides 8. But the multiplicative order modulo25 is φ(25)=20. So the order could be a divisor of 20 and 8, which is 4. So the order of n must divide 4. So n^4 ≡1 mod25. But wait, in our case n^4 ≡-1 mod25, so 1≡(-1)^2 mod25, which is 1, so that's okay. Wait, but n^8=(n^4)^2≡1 mod25, so the order divides 8, but since n^4≡-1, the order is 8.

But φ(25)=20, so 8 divides 20? No, because 20/8=2.5, which is not integer. So that's a problem. Wait, that can't be. Hmm, maybe my reasoning is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps there is no solution for p=5. Let me compute n^4 mod25 for some n.

Compute n^4 mod25:

n=1:1
n=2:16
n=3:81 mod25=6
n=4:256 mod25=6 (since 25*10=250, 256-250=6)
n=5:0
n=6:6^4=1296 mod25: 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21
n=7:7^4=2401 mod25: 2400 is 96*25, so 2401 mod25=1
n=8:8^4=4096 mod25: 4096-163*25=4096-4075=21
n=9:9^4=6561 mod25: 6561-262*25=6561-6550=11
n=10:0
n=11:11^4=14641 mod25: 14625 is 585*25, so 14641-14625=16
n=12:12^4=20736 mod25: 20725 is 829*25, so 20736-20725=11
n=13:13^4=28561 mod25: 28500 is 1140*25, 28561-28500=61, which mod25 is 11 (61-2*25=11)
n=14:14^4=38416 mod25: 38400 is 1536*25, so 38416-38400=16
n=15:0
n=16:16^4=65536 mod25: 65536-26
