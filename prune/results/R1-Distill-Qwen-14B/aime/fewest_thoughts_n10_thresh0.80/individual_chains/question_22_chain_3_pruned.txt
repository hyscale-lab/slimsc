Alright, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. First, let's recall what a convex equilateral hexagon is. It's a six-sided polygon where all sides are equal in length, and all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, making it convex. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Now, the problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

I think this triangle might be related to the concept of a "outer triangle" formed by extending certain sides of the hexagon. Since AB, CD, and EF are being extended, these sides are non-consecutive and might form a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

Let me visualize the hexagon ABCDEF. Since it's equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it's likely similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all angles equal. In a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, but here, the hexagon is only equilateral, not necessarily regular.

Given that, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Let's denote the intersection points of these extensions as the vertices of this triangle. Let me call these intersection points P, Q, and R, where P is the intersection of AB and CD, Q is the intersection of CD and EF, and R is the intersection of EF and AB. Hmm, but wait, in a convex hexagon, would these extensions intersect? Or maybe I'm getting the sides mixed up.

Wait, AB is extended, CD is extended, and EF is extended. So, AB and CD are opposite sides, so when extended, they might intersect at a point outside the hexagon. Similarly, CD and EF are not adjacent but maybe opposite? Wait, in a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. So, ABCDEF, AB is opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA.

Wait, so if we're extending AB, CD, and EF, then AB is opposite to DE, CD is opposite to FA, and EF is opposite to BC. So, maybe extending these three sides, each being opposite to another, could form a triangle.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. If I have hexagon ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Extending AB, CD, and EF. So, AB is extended beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F.

Since AB and CD are opposite sides, their extensions might meet at a point outside the hexagon. Similarly, CD and EF extensions would meet somewhere, and EF and AB extensions would meet somewhere else, forming a triangle.

Let me denote the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD, Q is the intersection of CD and EF, and R is the intersection of EF and AB. So, the sides of triangle PQR are PQ, QR, and RP, which have lengths 200, 240, and 300 respectively.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says the triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. So, the sides of this triangle are given, but I need to relate them to the side length of the hexagon.

I remember that in such configurations, the side length of the hexagon can be found using similar triangles or the concept of intercept theorems. Maybe I can set up ratios based on similar triangles formed by the extensions.

Perhaps I should consider the ratios of the sides. Let's denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Now, since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides are length 's'.

Let me think about the triangle PQR. Each side of this triangle is formed by the intersection of two extended sides of the hexagon. So, each side of triangle PQR is the sum of two segments: one from the extension of AB beyond A to P, another from B to P? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about the intercept theorem.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, but not necessarily regular, I can represent it in a coordinate system where each side is of length 's' and opposite sides are parallel.

But that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe using vectors or affine transformations.

Wait, another idea. Since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon
