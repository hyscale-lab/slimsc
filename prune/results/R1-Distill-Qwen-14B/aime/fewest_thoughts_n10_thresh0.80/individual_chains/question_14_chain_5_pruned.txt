Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Alright, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. We need the greatest such N, which means I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. So for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 should give a number that's a multiple of 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So A is the thousands digit, B is the hundreds, C is the tens, and D is the units digit.

The condition implies that if we replace A with 1, getting 1BCD, then 1BCD must be divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, which must be divisible by 7. Same for replacing C and D: AB1D and ABC1 must also be divisible by 7.

So, all four numbers formed by replacing each digit with 1 must be divisible by 7. That's the key property our N must have.

Our goal is to find the largest N (so the highest four-digit number) with this property. Once we find N, we'll divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, then add them together.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since we're looking for the largest N, starting from 9999 and going down seems logical. But this might take a long time manually, so perhaps I can find a smarter way.

First, let me note that N itself doesn't have to be divisible by 7. It's just that when each digit is replaced by 1, the resulting numbers must be divisible by 7.

Let me consider each digit replacement:

1. Replacing A with 1: 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.
2. Replacing B with 1: A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.
3. Replacing C with 1: AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D must be divisible by 7.
4. Replacing D with 1: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So we have four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

This seems like a system of congruences that N must satisfy. Maybe we can find relationships between the digits using these congruences.

Let me consider each condition modulo 7.

First, let's compute 1000 mod 7. Since 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 ÷7 is 14*7=98, so 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, and 1 mod7 is 1.

So let's rewrite each condition:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

So now we have four equations:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 ≡ 1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1)
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 ≡ 5 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 ≡ 4 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 ≡ 6 mod7

Hmm, this is a system of linear congruences in variables A, B, C, D. Let me write them down:

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7

Equation (2):6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7

Equation (3):6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7

Equation (4):6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7

I need to solve this system to find A, B, C, D digits (A from 1-9, others 0-9) such that all four conditions are satisfied.

This might be a bit involved, but perhaps we can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let me see.

First, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6A + 3C + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡5 -1 mod7

Simplify:

6A -2B ≡4 mod7

Which is 6A -2B ≡4 mod7. Let's write this as equation (5): 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (1):

(6A + 2B + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡4 -1 mod7

Simplify:

6A -3C ≡3 mod7

Which is equation (6):6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Now, subtract equation (5) from equation (6):

Equation (6) - Equation (5):

(6A -3C) - (6A -2B) ≡3 -4 mod7

Simplify:

(-3C + 2B) ≡-1 mod7 → 2B -3C ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6).

So equation (7): 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Wait, but that's the same as equation (1): 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7? Not exactly. Maybe not, let me see.

Wait, equation (1): 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Hmm. Maybe let's try to express variables in terms of others.

Looking at equation (5):6A -2B ≡4 mod7. Let's write this as:

6A ≡2B +4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 6 and 7 are coprime, 6 has inverse mod7, which is 6 because 6*6=36≡1 mod7. So multiplying both sides by 6:

(6*6)A ≡ (6*2)B + (6*4) mod7 → (36)A ≡12B +24 mod7.

Simplify: 1A ≡5B +3 mod7 → A ≡5B +3 mod7.

So A is congruent to 5B +3 mod7. Since A is a digit from 1 to9, let's note possible values of B and A.

Similarly, equation (6):6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

From equation (5), we had A ≡5B +3 mod7. Let's substitute that into equation (6):

6*(5B +3) -3C ≡3 mod7.

Compute 6*(5B +3): 30B +18. Mod7, 30 mod7 is 2 (since 7*4=28, 30-28=2), and 18 mod7 is 4 (7*2=14, 18-14=4). So:

2B +4 -3C ≡3 mod7.

Simplify: 2B -3C ≡ -1 ≡6 mod7. Which is the same as equation (7):2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

So that's consistent.

Now, equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

From equation (5), A ≡5B +3 mod7. Let's substitute:

6*(5B +3) +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Compute: 30B +18 +2B +3C. Mod7, 30B is 2B, 18 is 4, so:

2B +4 +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Combine like terms: (2B +2B) +3C +4 ≡6 mod7.

Which is 4B +3C +4 ≡6 mod7.

Subtract 4: 4B +3C ≡2 mod7.

So equation (8):4B +3C ≡2 mod7.

Now, we have equation (7):2B -3C ≡6 mod7 and equation (8):4B +3C ≡2 mod7.

Let me add equations (7) and (8) together:

(2B -3C) + (4B +3C) ≡6 +2 mod7.

Simplify:6B ≡8 mod7 →6B ≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7, which is 6:

B ≡6*1 mod7 → B ≡6 mod7.

So B is congruent to 6 mod7. Since B is a digit (0-9), possible values are B=6 or 13, but 13 is too big, so B=6.

So B=6.

Now, from equation (7):2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Plug B=6:

2*6 -3C ≡6 mod7 →12 -3C ≡6 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5, so:

5 -3C ≡6 mod7 → -3C ≡1 mod7 →3C ≡-1 mod7→3C≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7, which is 5 (since 3*5=15≡1 mod7):

C ≡6*5 mod7→30 mod7=2.

So C=2.

So now we have B=6 and C=2.

Now, from equation (
