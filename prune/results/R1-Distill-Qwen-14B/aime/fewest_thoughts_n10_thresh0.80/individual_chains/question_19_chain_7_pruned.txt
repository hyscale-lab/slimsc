Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, okay. So, let me visualize triangle ABC. It has a circumcenter O, which is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and an incenter I, which is the center of the inscribed circle.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. Also, the circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. The goal is AB·AC.

I think I should recall some formulas related to triangle centers and their properties. Maybe something involving distances between O and I?

Wait, I remember the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, OI. It's given by OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me confirm that... Yes, Euler's formula states that OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, plugging in R=13 and r=6, we get OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me compute that: 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, that's interesting. So OI is sqrt(13). Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, that means the line IA is at a right angle to OI. So, in triangle IOA, which is a right triangle, IA is one leg, OI is the other leg, and OA is the hypotenuse.

Wait, but OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, in triangle IOA, OA is 13, OI is sqrt(13), and IA is perpendicular to OI. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, IA² + OI² = OA².

Let me write that down: IA² + (sqrt(13))² = 13². So IA² + 13 = 169. Therefore, IA² = 169 -13 = 156. So IA is sqrt(156). Let me simplify that: sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, okay. So IA is 2*sqrt(39). But IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. Wait, is there a formula that relates the distance from the incenter to a vertex?

I think the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is sqrt(r² + (s - a)²), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC. Let me check that.

Alternatively, maybe it's sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). Yeah, I think that's the formula. So, in this case, IA² = r² + (s - a)^2.

Given that IA² is 15
