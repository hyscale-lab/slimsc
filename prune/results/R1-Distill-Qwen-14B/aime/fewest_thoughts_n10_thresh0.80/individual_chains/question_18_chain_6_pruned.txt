Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. But I need to figure out how to count all possible rectangles.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with each interior angle being 150 degrees. But how does that help me with counting rectangles? Maybe I should think about the symmetries and how the sides and diagonals can form rectangles.

I know that a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. So, for a rectangle to be formed inside the dodecagon, all four sides must lie on either the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon, and the angles between consecutive sides must be 90 degrees.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals have different lengths. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle can only be certain specific diagonals or sides of the dodecagon.

I think a good starting point is to consider the number of ways to select four points on the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. Because each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal, each vertex of the rectangle must be a vertex of the dodecagon.

Wait a minute, is that necessarily true? If the sides of the rectangle lie on sides or diagonals, then the vertices of the rectangle might not necessarily be the vertices of the dodecagon. Hmm, that complicates things. Because maybe a rectangle could have sides that are diagonals of the dodecagon, but its vertices aren't at the dodecagon's vertices.

But the problem states that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, if a side of the rectangle is a diagonal of the dodecagon, then the endpoints of that diagonal (which are vertices of the dodecagon) would be part of the rectangle. Similarly, if a side of the rectangle is a side of the dodecagon, then the endpoints are vertices of the dodecagon.

Therefore, it seems that the vertices of
