Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but I'll take it step by step.

First, let me write down what I know. The expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, and |z| = 4. Since z is a complex number with a magnitude of 4, I can represent it in polar form. So z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier to handle because polar forms often simplify when dealing with magnitudes and arguments.

Wait, but maybe it's better to write z as 4e^{iθ} so that 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}, right? Because the reciprocal of a complex number in polar form is just the reciprocal of the magnitude and the negative of the angle. So that might help in simplifying the expression.

Let me substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression. So, (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/(4e^{iθ})). Simplifying each term:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}
Second term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So the entire expression becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, now I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. So the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}. The real part will be Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}).

I remember that Re(C e^{iθ}) for a complex number C is equal to |C| cos(θ + φ), where φ is the argument of C. Let me check that. If C = a + ib, then Re(C e^{iθ}) = a cosθ - b sinθ = |C| cos(θ + φ), where φ = arctan(b/a). Yes, that's correct.

So, applying this to A and B:

Re(A e^{iθ}) = |A| cos(θ + φ_A)
Re(B e^{-iθ}) = |B| cos(-θ + φ_B) = |B| cos(θ - φ_B), since cos(-x) = cos x.

So the total real part is |A| cos(θ + φ_A) + |B| cos(θ - φ_B).

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ. Let me compute |A|, φ_A, |B|, and φ_B first.

Calculating |A|: A = 300 + 468i. So |A| = sqrt(300^2 + 468^2). Let me compute that.

300^2 = 90,000
468^2 = let's compute 468*468. Hmm, 400^2=160,000, 68^2=4,624, and cross terms 2*400*68=54,400. So (400+68)^2=400^2 + 2*400*68 + 68^2 = 160,000 + 54,400 + 4,624 = 219,024. Therefore, |A| = sqrt(90,000 + 219,024) = sqrt(309,024).

Wait, let me check that sqrt(309,024). Let me see, 550^2 is 302,500, 556^2 is 556*556. Hmm, 550^2=302,500, 556^2 = (550+6)^2 = 550^2 + 2*550*6 + 6^2 = 302,500 + 6,600 + 36 = 309,136. Oh, wait, that's higher than 309,024. So sqrt(309,024) is between 555 and 556. Let me compute 555^2=308,025. Then 309,024 - 308,025 = 999. So, 555^2=308,025, 555. something squared equals 309,024. Hmm, maybe I don't need the exact value because perhaps it's a perfect square? Wait, 309,024 divided by 4 is 77,256. Hmm, 77,256 divided by 4 is 19,314. Not sure, maybe it's better to just leave it as sqrt(309024) for now. Alternatively, maybe factor it.

Wait, 309,024. Let's see, 309,024 = 4 * 77,256. 77,256 = 4 * 19,314. 19,314=2*9,657. 9,657 divided by 3 is 3,219. 3,219 divided by 3 is 1,073. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can write |A| as 12*sqrt( something ). Wait, 300 is 12*25, 468 is 12*39. So |A| = sqrt( (12*25)^2 + (12*39)^2 ) = 12*sqrt(25^2 + 39^2). 25^2=625, 39^2=1,521. 625+1,521=2,146. So |A|=12*sqrt(2146). Hmm, maybe that's helpful.

Wait, 2146. Let me check if that's a perfect square. 46^2=2116, 47^2=2209. So no, it's not a perfect square. So |A|=12*sqrt(2146). I'll keep that in mind.

Similarly, |B| is sqrt(24^2 + 36^2). 24^2=576, 36^2=1,296. Sum is 1,872. So sqrt(1,872). Let me see if 1,872 is a perfect square. 43^2=1,849, 44^2=1,936. So sqrt(1,872) is between 43 and 44. Hmm, 1,872 divided by 16 is 117, so sqrt(1,872)=4*sqrt(117). 117 factors into 9*13, so sqrt(117)=3*sqrt(13). So |B|=4*3*sqrt(13)=12*sqrt(13).

Wait, wait, let me check that again. |B|=sqrt(24^2 + 36^2) = sqrt(576 + 1296)=sqrt(1872)=sqrt(16*117)=4*sqrt(117). And sqrt(117)=sqrt(9*13)=3*sqrt(13). So |B|=4*3*sqrt(13)=12*sqrt(13). Yes, that's correct.

Now, the arguments φ_A and φ_B. For A=300 + 468i, φ_A = arctan(468/300). Let me compute that. 468/300 = 1.56. So φ_A is arctan(1.56). Let me find the approximate value. arctan(1)=45 degrees, arctan(1.5574)=57 degrees (since tan(57)≈1.5399, close to 1.56). So maybe around 57 degrees. But exact value isn't needed right now.

For B=24 + 36i, φ_B = arctan(36/24)= arctan(1.5)= approximately 56.3 degrees. Hmm, close to each other. Maybe I can write them as exact expressions later.

So the real part Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}) = |A| cos(θ + φ_A) + |B| cos(θ - φ_B).

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check. Re(C e^{iθ}) is |C| cos(θ + φ_C), because when you multiply C = |C| e^{iφ_C}, then Re(C e^{iθ}) = |C| cos(φ_C + θ). Similarly, Re(B e^{-iθ}) = Re(B e^{-iθ}) = |B| cos(-θ + φ_B). But cos(-θ + φ_B) = cos(φ_B - θ), which is the same as cos(θ - φ_B) because cos is even. So yes, correct.

So the expression becomes |A| cos(θ + φ_A) + |B| cos(θ - φ_B).

Wait, perhaps I can combine these terms using trigonometric identities. The sum of two cosines can sometimes be written as a product or another form. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this as a single cosine function with some amplitude and phase shift, then find its maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2].

So let me apply this identity to the two cosine terms.

Let me denote:

cos(θ + φ_A) + cos(θ - φ_B) = 2 cos[ ( (θ + φ_A) + (θ - φ_B) ) / 2 ] cos[ ( (θ + φ_A) - (θ - φ_B) ) / 2 ]

Which simplifies to:

2 cos[ (2θ + φ_A - φ_B)/2 ] cos[ (φ_A + φ_B)/2 ]

Which is:

2 cos(θ + (φ_A - φ_B)/2 ) cos( (φ_A + φ_B)/2 )

So the real part is |A| * 2 cos(θ + (φ_A - φ_B)/2 ) cos( (φ_A + φ_B)/2 ) + |B| * ... Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expression is |A| * cos(θ + φ_A) + |B| * cos(θ - φ_B). So I tried to apply the identity to cos(θ + φ_A) + cos(θ - φ_B), but the coefficients |A| and |B| complicate things.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Perhaps I can write the entire expression as a single complex function, find its real part, and then maximize it.

Wait, another approach: Let me represent z as 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Then the expression becomes (75 + 117i)*4 e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)*(1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute these coefficients:

(75 + 117i)*4 = 300 + 468i
(96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i

So the expression is (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, to find the real part, I can write e^{iθ} as cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} as cosθ - i sinθ.

So expanding the terms:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Let me multiply each term:

First term:
(300)(cosθ) + (300)(i sinθ) + (468i)(cosθ) + (468i)(i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468 i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i + 468 (-1) sinθ
= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)

Second term:
(24)(cosθ) + (24)(-i sinθ) + (36i)(cosθ) + (36i)(-i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36 i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i + 36 sinθ
= (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)

Now, adding the two terms together:

Real parts:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

Wait, but since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can ignore the imaginary part. So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Wait, that seems a bit simpler than before. So Re(expression) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, now I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ. Since it's a linear combination of sine and cosine, I can write it as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value would then be R.

So, let me compute R. For an expression A cosθ + B sinθ, the amplitude R is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, but in this case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So A is 324, B is -432.

So R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Let's compute that.

324^2: Let me compute 300^2=90,000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14,400. So (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

432^2: Let me compute 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So 324^2 + 432^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So R = sqrt(291,600) = 540. Because 540^2 = 291,600. Let me check: 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, 2*500*40=40,000. So (500+40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. Yes, that's correct.

So the maximum real part is 540. So that's the answer.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps. Let me go back.

I started by expressing z as 4e^{iθ}, substituted into the expression, expanded it, and found the real part as 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Then, I recognized this as a linear combination of sine and cosine and found its amplitude as 540, which is the maximum value. That seems correct.

So the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting \(z\) into the expression, we simplify it to:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding each term using Euler's formula and combining like terms, we focus on the real part of the expression, which simplifies to:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

This is a linear combination of \(\cos\theta\) and \(\sin\theta\), and its maximum value is the amplitude \(R\) given by:

\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is:

\[
\boxed{540}
\]
