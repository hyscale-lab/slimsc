Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere, and I need to find the difference between the radii of the tangent circles when the torus is inside and outside the sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, in my mind, it's like a donut where the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3. That should mean the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube) is 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. When the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Similarly, when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i - r_o and express it as m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

I think the key here is to find the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases. Let me think about the geometry of tangency.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus touches the sphere at a single circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is smaller, touching the torus externally. Wait, no, actually, in both cases, the sphere has a fixed radius of 11. Wait, no, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has to contain the torus, so the sphere is larger. When the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus? Wait, no, the problem says "when T rests on the inside of S" and "when T rests on the outside of S". So in the first case, T is inside S, so S is larger. In the second case, T is outside S, meaning T encloses S? Or perhaps S is inside T? Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe the sphere is fixed, and the torus can be placed inside or outside of it. So in the first case, the torus is inside the sphere, touching it from the inside, and in the second case, the torus is outside the sphere, touching it from the outside.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so when it's inside the sphere, it must be entirely contained within the sphere, touching it at a single circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the sphere is entirely contained within the torus, touching it along another single circle.

Wait, no, actually, the torus is a surface, so when it's resting on the inside of the sphere, it's placed such that the sphere is outside the torus, and they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when resting on the outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they are tangent along another circle.

Wait, that makes sense. So in both cases, the sphere and the torus touch along a circle, but the position (inside or outside) determines the radius of that circle.

So, to find r_i and r_o, I need to figure out the radius of the circle where the sphere is tangent to the torus in each case.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, that circle must lie on both surfaces and the surfaces must share a common tangent plane at every point of the circle.

Let me try to model the torus mathematically. The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin, with major radius R and minor radius r, is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

In our case, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²)
