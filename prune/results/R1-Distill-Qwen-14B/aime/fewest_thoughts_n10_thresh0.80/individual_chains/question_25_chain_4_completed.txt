Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. There are 900 residents total. Each one owns a bag of candy hearts, which is a given. Plus, some own other things: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively.

Wait, so each resident owns at least the candy hearts. But some might own one, two, three, or all four of these items. The problem says there are 437 who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. I need to find out how many own all four. 

Hmm, this seems like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding up their individual sizes, subtracting their pairwise intersections, adding back their triple intersections, and so on.

But wait, here we're dealing with exact numbers. The 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So perhaps we need to relate this to the inclusion-exclusion formula. 

Let me list out what I know:

Total residents: 900. Each owns a candy heart, so that's the universal set. So, everyone is part of that set. The other three sets are diamond ring owners, golf club owners, and garden spade owners.

Let me denote:
- D = number of residents owning a diamond ring = 195
- G = number owning golf clubs = 367
- S = number owning garden spades = 562
- C = number owning candy hearts = 900 (since everyone owns this)

But we're interested in how many own all four, which would be the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since everyone owns C, it's the same as the intersection of D, G, and S. So, perhaps I can model this without worrying about C, since it's universal.

Wait, but in the inclusion-exclusion principle, we need to consider all combinations. Let me think again. So, the total number of items owned is calculated by the sum of each individual set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple intersections minus the four-way intersection, and so on.

But in this problem, we have specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three. So maybe I can model it using the formula for the union of three sets.

Wait, the formula for the union of three sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But I don't know |D∩G|, |D∩S|, or |G∩S|, nor do I know |D∩G∩S|. But I have information about exactly two and exactly three.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote:

Let a = number of people owning exactly two things,
b = number owning exactly three things,
c = number owning all four,
d = number owning exactly one thing,
e = number owning none.

Wait, but in this problem, everyone owns at least a candy heart. So e = 0, because everyone has the candy hearts. So the total is d + a + b + c = 900.

But wait, the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, a = 437, b = 234. Then, d + c = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. So d + c = 229.

But I don't know d or c individually yet. So perhaps I can relate this to the inclusion-exclusion.

Wait, the number of people owning exactly two things is given by:

a = |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - 3c

Wait, why? Because each pairwise intersection includes those who own exactly two of those two, plus those who own all three. So, the exact number for each pair is |D∩G| - c, |D∩S| - c, and |G∩S| - c. So, the total a is the sum of these:

a = (|D∩G| - c) + (|D∩S| - c) + (|G∩S| - c) = |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - 3c

Similarly, the number of people who own exactly three things is b = |D∩G∩S| - c? Wait, no. Let me think. The triple intersection |D∩G∩S| includes those who own all three, which is exactly the 234. Wait, no, because in the triple intersection, they own all three, but if we also consider the candy hearts, which everyone has, then |D∩G∩S| is the same as the number of people who own all three except candy hearts. Wait, no, because everyone owns candy hearts. So |D∩G∩S| is the number of people who own D, G, and S, which is exactly those who own all four? Or no, because they also have C, which is universal. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as four sets: D, G, S, and C. But since everyone is in C, the total is the union of D, G, S, and C is the entire 900. So maybe it's easier to think in terms of the three sets D, G, S, with universal set being C.

Wait, in that case, the standard inclusion-exclusion applies for D, G, S. So:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But since everyone owns C, which is the universal set, the union of D, G, S is the same as the number of residents owning at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone owns C, which is the universal set, but not everyone owns D, G, or S.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me think again. Since C is universal, every resident is in C. Then, the union of D, G, S, and C is 900, but C is already the entire population. So, the union of D, G, S is the same as the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S, plus those who own none of D, G, S but own C. Wait, no, because C is already included. So perhaps the total number of people in D ∪ G ∪ S is equal to the number of people who own at least D, G, or S, and the rest would be those who don't own any of those three. But since everyone owns C, the ones who don't own D, G, or S are exactly those who own only C.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anyone owning only C. Hmm, maybe that's not important. Let me try to get back to the problem.

We have:

- Exactly two things: 437, which includes the other things (but since C is always present, maybe these are the people who have exactly two of the other three, plus C. So, each of the 437 has exactly two of D, G, S, plus C.

Similarly, exactly three things: 234, which would have exactly three of D, G, S, plus C.

And then, those who own all four would be those who have D, G, S, and C. So, the problem is to find c, the number of people who have all four.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should model the exact numbers.

Let me denote:

n1 = number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S (plus C)
n2 = number owning exactly two of D, G, S (plus C) = 437
n3 = number owning exactly three of D, G, S (plus C) = 234
n4 = number owning all four (D, G, S, C) = ?

But since C is universal, n1, n2, n3, n4 all include C, so the exact numbers are:

n1: exactly one of D, G, S, plus C.

n2: exactly two of D, G, S, plus C.

n3: exactly three of D, G, S, plus C.

n4: all four, which would be exactly D, G, S, and C, so it's the same as exactly three of D, G, S, and C. Wait, no, because C is always present. So if someone owns D, G, S, and C, that's three additional items beyond C, so they own four in total, but in terms of D, G, S, it's all three.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the exact counts.

Each resident owns C, and some own D, G, S as well.

So, the number of people owning exactly k of D, G, S is given, but in the problem, we're told that 437 own exactly two of these (so exactly two of D, G, S, plus C), 234 own exactly three (so D, G, S, and C), and we need to find how many own all four, which would be the same as those owning exactly three of D, G, S, and C, which is the 234. Wait, but that's not correct, because if someone owns all three of D, G, S, plus C, that's four items, but the problem says 234 own exactly three of the things. Wait, perhaps the problem counts C as one of the four things. Oh, wait, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the four things are D, G, S, and C. So, when the problem says "exactly two of these things," it's referring to exactly two out of the four. Similarly, exactly three would be exactly three out of four.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So, the four things are D, G, S, and C. So, when it says 437 own exactly two, that's two of the four. So, for example, someone could own D and C, but not G or S. Or D and G, but not S or C, but wait, no, because everyone owns C. So, in reality, if someone owns exactly two of the four, it's C plus one other. Because C is always present. So, for example, someone owns C and D but not G or S, or C and G but not D or S, or C and S but not D or G. So, the "exactly two" category would be the sum of the people who have C and exactly one of D, G, S.

Similarly, the "exactly three" category would be those who have C and exactly two of D, G, S. Wait, no. Wait, if someone has exactly three of the four, that would be C, plus two of D, G, S. So, the exact three would be C, D, G; C, D, S; or C, G, S. So, the number of people owning exactly three is 234. And those owning exactly four would be those who have C, D, G, and S, which is the c we're trying to find.

Wait, but let me think again. If someone owns exactly two of the four things, since C is always present, that must be C plus exactly one other. So, the number of people owning exactly two is the sum of those owning C and D only, C and G only, and C and S only. So, those who own exactly two are the ones with exactly one of D, G, S along with C. So, the 437 is the sum of (C ∩ D only) + (C ∩ G only) + (C ∩ S only).

Similarly, the 234 who own exactly three would be the sum of those who have C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S. So, those are the people with exactly two of D, G, S plus C.

And those who own all four are exactly those who have C, D, G, S, which is the same as the triple intersection of D, G, S. Since C is always present.

So, the problem is now to find the number of people who own all four, which is the same as the number of people who own D, G, and S, given that everyone owns C.

Now, let's model this with variables.

Let me define:

- a = number of people owning exactly C and D only: so they have exactly two things.
- b = number owning exactly C and G only.
- c = number owning exactly C and S only.
- d = number owning exactly C, D, and G (so exactly three things).
- e = number owning exactly C, D, and S.
- f = number owning exactly C, G, and S.
- g = number owning all four: C, D, G, S.

So, the total number of people is the sum of all these:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.

The problem tells us that the number of people owning exactly two things is 437. So, a + b + c = 437.

The number owning exactly three things is 234, which is d + e + f.

And the number owning all four is g, which is what we need to find.

So, from the total:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900

But we know a + b + c = 437, and d + e + f = 234. So,

437 + 234 + g = 900

So, 671 + g = 900 → g = 900 - 671 = 229.

Wait, so g would be 229? That seems straightforward. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Because if I sum up exactly two (437) and exactly three (234), plus those who own all four (g), but wait, no, because g is a separate category. Wait, no, because the 437 is exactly two, 234 is exactly three, and g is exactly four. So, the sum of these three should be 437 + 234 + g = 900 - (number of people who own exactly one thing). Wait, but in my earlier breakdown, the total is 900 = a + b + c + d + e + f + g, where a + b + c = 437, d + e + f = 234, and g is what's left. So, 437 + 234 + g = 900 - (number who own exactly one thing, which is zero in this case, because everyone owns C, so if they own exactly one thing, it's C plus nothing else. But the problem doesn't give us any info on exactly one. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.

Each person owns at least C. So, the possible ownerships are:

- Only C: owns exactly one thing.
- C and D only: exactly two.
- C and G only: exactly two.
- C and S only: exactly two.
- C, D, G: exactly three.
- C, D, S: exactly three.
- C, G, S: exactly three.
- C, D, G, S: exactly four.

So, the total number of people is the sum of all these groups.

The problem says:

- Exactly two: 437 → which is (C and D) + (C and G) + (C and S) = 437.
- Exactly three: 234 → which is (C, D, G) + (C, D, S) + (C, G, S) = 234.
- Exactly four: g → which is our unknown.

The number of people who own exactly one thing (only C) is 900 - (437 + 234 + g). Because the rest would be those who own more than one.

But maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula to relate the counts.

The total number owning D is 195. Let me think about how that's composed.

The number of people owning D is equal to those who have D and nothing else (only D and C) plus those who have D and G only, D and S only, D and G and S, and D and G and S and C.

Wait, but in our earlier variables:

a = C and D only → owns exactly two things.
d = C, D, G → exactly three.
e = C, D, S → exactly three.
g = C, D, G, S → exactly four.

So, the total number of D owners is a + d + e + g = 195.

Similarly, the number of G owners is b + d + f + g = 367.

The number of S owners is c + e + f + g = 562.

So, we have three equations:

1. a + d + e + g = 195
2. b + d + f + g = 367
3. c + e + f + g = 562

We also have:

4. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two things)
5. d + e + f = 234 (exactly three things)
6. a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900

We can try to solve these equations to find g.

From equation 6, we can express g as:

g = 900 - (a + b + c + d + e + f)
But from equations 4 and 5, a + b + c = 437, d + e + f = 234, so:
g = 900 - (437 + 234) = 900 - 671 = 229.

Wait, that's the same as earlier. So, is g=229?

But let me check if this makes sense with the other equations.

Let me see: If g=229, then from equation 1:

a + d + e + 229 = 195 → a + d + e = 195 - 229 = -34.

Wait, that can't be right. You can't have a negative number of people. So, that suggests an error in my reasoning.

Wait, so that's a problem. If g=229, then equation 1 would suggest a + d + e = -34, which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Let me go back. Maybe the way I defined the variables is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the inclusion-exclusion.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, since D, G, S are the only ones beyond C.

Wait, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to |D ∪ G ∪ S|.

But since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900, which includes those who own only C and possibly others.

Wait, no, because D, G, S are subsets of the entire population, which is C. So, the union of D, G, S is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S, which is equal to the total number of people (900) minus the number who own only C. But the problem doesn't give us the number of people who own only C.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem without that. Let me try using inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S, keeping in mind that each person owns C.

The inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. Let me denote this as T.

So, T = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But T is also equal to the number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S, plus those who own exactly two, plus those who own exactly three. Since everyone owns C, but we're considering only D, G, S for this union.

Wait, but T would be the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, which is equal to the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and all four. But since all four implies owning D, G, S, which is part of the union.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

Number owning at least one of D, G, S = (number owning exactly one) + (number owning exactly two) + (number owning exactly three) + (number owning exactly four).

But wait, in our problem, the number owning exactly two is 437, which includes owning exactly two of D, G, S, plus C. Similarly, exactly three is 234, which includes C. So, the number owning exactly two of D, G, S is 437, but in terms of the union, it's 437.

Wait, but maybe this is getting too tangled.

Let me try to use the inclusion-exclusion formula with the given data.

We have:

Number owning D: 195

Number owning G: 367

Number owning S: 562

Number owning exactly two: 437

Number owning exactly three: 234

We need to find the number owning all four.

Let me denote x as the number owning all four (which is the same as D∩G∩S).

We can model the number of people owning exactly two as:

Number owning exactly two = (number owning D and G only) + (D and S only) + (G and S only)

Each of these is equal to |D∩G| - x, |D∩S| - x, |G∩S| - x.

So,

Exactly two = (|D∩G| - x) + (|D∩S| - x) + (|G∩S| - x) = (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) - 3x = 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three is x, because it's the intersection of all three, D∩G∩S = x.

So, from the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S, which is equal to:

Number owning exactly one + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four.

But wait, in our problem, the total number of people is 900, and each owns C. So, the number owning at least one of D, G, S is 900 minus the number who own only C. But we don't know how many own only C.

Wait, but perhaps we can express |D ∪ G ∪ S| as the total number minus those who own only C.

Let me denote y as the number of people who own only C. So,

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - y.

But since the problem doesn't mention y, maybe it's zero, but that's not the case because the numbers don't add up. Alternatively, perhaps we can find y using the given data.

Wait, but let's see if we can proceed without knowing y.

From inclusion-exclusion,

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + x.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - y, so:

195 + 367 + 562 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + x = 900 - y.

So,

1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + x = 900 - y.

Rearranging,

(|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) = 1124 - (900 - y) + x = 224 + y + x.

But from earlier, the exactly two equation:

(|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) = 437 + 3x.

So,

437 + 3x = 224 + y + x → 2x = 224 + y - 437 → 2x = y - 213 → y = 2x + 213.

Now, let's think about the counts.

The number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S is:

(|D| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| - |D∩G∩S|)) + similar terms for G and S.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

Number owning exactly one = |D| - (number owning D and another) - x.

Wait, alternatively, the number owning exactly one is:

(|D| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| - x)) + (|G| - (|D∩G| + |G∩S| - x)) + (|S| - (|D∩S| + |G∩S| - x)).

But that might get complicated.

Alternatively, since the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S is equal to:

(|D| - (number owning D and G or D and S or all three)) + similar for G and S.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the variables we have.

Wait, the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S is equal to:

(|D| - (number owning D and G only + D and S only + D, G, S)) + similar for G and S.

Which is:

(|D| - ( (|D∩G| - x) + (|D∩S| - x) + x )) + (|G| - ( (|D∩G| - x) + (|G∩S| - x) + x )) + (|S| - ( (|D∩S| - x) + (|G∩S| - x) + x )).

Simplifying each term:

For D:

|D| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| - 2x + x) = |D| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| - x)

Similarly for G and S.

So, the total number of people owning exactly one is:

(|D| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| - x)) + (|G| - (|D∩G| + |G∩S| - x)) + (|S| - (|D∩S| + |G∩S| - x)).

Which simplifies to:

(|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2(|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + 3x.

But from earlier, we had:

(|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) = 437 + 3x.

Substituting that in:

(|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2*(437 + 3x) + 3x.

Which is:

195 + 367 + 562 - 874 - 6x + 3x.

Calculating:

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

1124 - 874 = 250.

So, 250 - 3x.

So, the number of people owning exactly one is 250 - 3x.

Now, the total number of people is:

Exactly one + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four.

Which is:

(250 - 3x) + 437 + 234 + x = 900.

Calculating:

250 - 3x + 437 + 234 + x = 900.

Adding the constants:

250 + 437 = 687; 687 + 234 = 921.

So, 921 - 2x = 900.

Solving:

921 - 2x = 900 → 21 = 2x → x = 10.5.

Wait, that can't be right. x has to be an integer because it's the number of people.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculations.

Let me check my steps again.

I had:

Number owning exactly one = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2*(|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + 3x.

Which I substituted as:

(|D| + |G| + |S|) is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.

(|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) = 437 + 3x.

So,

Number owning exactly one = 1124 - 2*(437 + 3x) + 3x = 1124 - 874 - 6x + 3x = 250 -3x.

Then, total people:

(250 -3x) + 437 + 234 + x = 900.

Adding up 250 + 437 + 234 = 921.

So,

921 - 2x = 900 → 21 = 2x → x = 10.5.

That's not possible because x must be an integer. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of people owning exactly one.

Let me go back to that part.

Earlier, I thought that the number owning exactly one is 250 - 3x. But that leads to a non-integer x, which is impossible. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Let me try another approach.

We have:

Exactly two: 437 = (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) - 3x.

Exactly three: 234 = x.

Wait, no, because if x is the number owning all three, then the number owning exactly three is x. So, perhaps 234 = x.

Wait, but that would mean x=234.

But then, substituting into the exactly two equation:

437 = (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) - 3*234 → 437 = (sum of pairwise intersections) - 702 → sum of pairwise intersections = 437 + 702 = 1139.

Now, let's use the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - (sum of pairwise) + |D∩G∩S|.

Which is:

195 + 367 + 562 - 1139 + 234.

Calculating:

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

1124 - 1139 = -15.

-15 + 234 = 219.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 219.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S. Since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900, so the number who own only C is 900 - 219 = 681.

But let's check if this makes sense with the other data.

We have:

Exactly two: 437.

Exactly three: 234.

Exactly four: x = 234.

So, sum of exactly two, exactly three, exactly four is 437 + 234 + 234 = 905, which is more than 900. That can't be right. So, there's a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in setting exactly three = x. Because in reality, when we have four items (C, D, G, S), exactly three would include C and two others, so the number of people owning exactly three is 234, which includes C. So, perhaps the number owning exactly three of the four things is 234, but the number owning all three of D, G, S is less than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the counts for three things in the four-item context with the three-way intersection in the three-set problem.

Let me clarify:

In the problem, "exactly three of these things" refers to exactly three out of the four: C, D, G, S. So, that includes owning C plus any two of D, G, S. So, the number of people owning exactly three is 234, which includes all combinations where they have C and exactly two of the others.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly four is the number of people who have C, D, G, and S, which is what we're trying to find, let's call it x.

So, the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which includes C and exactly one other. So, they have C plus one of D, G, S.

So, the counts are:

Exactly two: C + any one of D, G, S → 437.

Exactly three: C + any two of D, G, S → 234.

Exactly four: C + D + G + S → x.

And exactly one: C only → y = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the number owning exactly one is y. So, y = 229 - x.

Now, let's model the ownership of D, G, S:

The number owning D is 195. This includes:

- Those who have D and nothing else (but since everyone has C, this is those who have C and D only, which is part of exactly two, so count is a).

- Those who have D and G only (part of exactly two, count is (D∩G) - x).

- Those who have D and S only (count is (D∩S) - x).

- Those who have D, G, and S (count is x).

So, total D owners:

a + (D∩G - x) + (D∩S - x) + x = a + D∩G + D∩S - x.

But a is part of exactly two, so a = (C∩D only) = (D only) = number of people with exactly two things (C and D only). Similarly for G and S.

Wait, maybe it's better to express the number owning D as:

Number owning D = (number with exactly two things including D) + (number with exactly three things including D) + (number with exactly four things).

So,

Number owning D = a (C and D) + (d + e) (where d is C, D, G; e is C, D, S) + x (C, D, G, S).

But wait, in our earlier variables, exactly two things include those with C and D, C and G, C and S. So, a is C and D only, which is part of exactly two.

Similarly, the number of people with exactly three things including D would be those with C, D, G and C, D, S, which are d and e, respectively.

And those with all four is x.

So,

195 = a + d + e + x.

Similarly for G:

367 = b + d + f + x.

And for S:

562 = c + e + f + x.

We also know:

a + b + c = 437 (exactly two things).

d + e + f = 234 (exactly three things).

And the total number of people is:

a + b + c + d + e + f + x = 900.

We can substitute the known sums:

437 + 234 + x = 900 → 671 + x = 900 → x = 229.

Wait, so x=229. But let's check if this fits into the equations for D, G, S.

From D's equation:

195 = a + d + e + 229.

But this implies a + d + e = 195 - 229 = -34, which is impossible because you can't have negative people.

Hmm, this indicates a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when we're considering the number of people owning D, it's not just the sum of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four with D, because in the four-item context, exactly three would mean they have C plus two of D, G, S. So, when considering the number of people owning D, they could have:

- Exactly two: C and D.

- Exactly three: C, D, G; C, D, S.

- Exactly four: C, D, G, S.

So, the number of D owners is a + d + e + x.

Similarly, the number of G owners is b + d + f + x.

And the number of S owners is c + e + f + x.

So, perhaps substituting x=229 would make these equations:

195 = a + d + e + 229 → a + d + e = -34. Impossible.

So, perhaps I made an error in assuming x=229.

Wait, where did x=229 come from?

From the total equation:

a + b + c + d + e + f + x = 900.

We know a + b + c = 437.

d + e + f = 234.

So,

437 + 234 + x = 900 → x = 229.

But this leads to a problem in the D equation. So, perhaps the data is inconsistent?

Wait, but the problem states that there are 437 with exactly two, 234 with exactly three, and asks for exactly four. So, perhaps the data is correct, and my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should try a different approach using the inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the number of people owning exactly two of the four things (including C) is 437, which includes C and one other. So, the number of people owning exactly two is equal to the sum over each pair involving C.

So, exactly two: C&D, C&G, C&S.

Similarly, exactly three: C&D&G, C&D&S, C&G&S.

Exactly four: C&D&G&S.

So, the number of people owning exactly two is (C&D - exactly four) + (C&G - exactly four) + (C&S - exactly four) = 437.

Similarly, the number owning exactly three is (C&D&G - exactly four) + (C&D&S - exactly four) + (C&G&S - exactly four) = 234.

So, let me denote:

Let a = C&D only → exactly two.

b = C&G only.

c = C&S only.

d = C&D&G only → exactly three.

e = C&D&S only.

f = C&G&S only.

g = C&D&G&S → exactly four.

So, the number of people owning exactly two is a + b + c = 437.

Exactly three is d + e + f = 234.

Exactly four is g = ?

Now, the number of people owning D is a + d + e + g = 195.

Similarly, the number owning G is b + d + f + g = 367.

The number owning S is c + e + f + g = 562.

We have equations:

1. a + b + c = 437.

2. d + e + f = 234.

3. a + d + e + g = 195.

4. b + d + f + g = 367.

5. c + e + f + g = 562.

We need to find g.

Let me express a, b, c from equation 1 as:

a = 437 - b - c.

Similarly, from equation 2:

d = 234 - e - f.

Now, substitute these into equations 3, 4, 5.

Equation 3:

(437 - b - c) + (234 - e - f) + e + g = 195.

Simplify:

437 - b - c + 234 - e - f + e + g = 195.

Combine like terms:

(437 + 234) + (-b - c) + (-f) + g = 195.

671 - b - c - f + g = 195.

Rearranged:

-b - c - f + g = 195 - 671 = -476.

Equation 4:

b + (234 - e - f) + f + g = 367.

Simplify:

b + 234 - e - f + f + g = 367.

Which becomes:

b + 234 - e + g = 367.

Rearranged:

b - e + g = 367 - 234 = 133.

Equation 5:

c + e + f + g = 562.

Now, from equation 3 substitution, we have:

-b - c - f + g = -476 → Let's call this equation 3a.

From equation 4 substitution, we have:

b - e + g = 133 → equation 4a.

Equation 5: c + e + f + g = 562 → equation 5.

Now, let's try to solve these equations.

From equation 4a: b = 133 + e - g.

From equation 3a: -b - c - f + g = -476.

Substitute b from 4a into 3a:

-(133 + e - g) - c - f + g = -476.

Which simplifies:

-133 - e + g - c - f + g = -476.

Combine like terms:

-133 - e - c - f + 2g = -476.

Rearranged:

- e - c - f + 2g = -476 + 133 = -343.

So,

- e - c - f + 2g = -343 → equation 3b.

From equation 5: c + e + f = 562 - g.

Let me denote this as equation 5a.

Now, let's substitute c + e + f from equation 5a into equation 3b.

Equation 3b: - e - c - f + 2g = -343.

Which becomes:

- (c + e + f) + 2g = -343.

From 5a, c + e + f = 562 - g.

So,

- (562 - g) + 2g = -343.

Simplify:

-562 + g + 2g = -343 → -562 + 3g = -343.

Adding 562 to both sides:

3g = 562 - 343 = 219.

So,

g = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, the number of people owning all four things is 73.

Let me check if this makes sense.

So, g=73.

From equation 5a: c + e + f = 562 - 73 = 489.

From equation 2: d + e + f = 234 → d = 234 - e - f.

From equation 3b: -e - c - f + 2g = -343.

We have g=73, so:

-e - c - f + 146 = -343 → -e - c - f = -489.

Which is consistent with equation 5a since c + e + f = 489.

So,

-e - c - f = - (c + e + f) = -489.

So, that's correct.

Now, let's find other variables.

From equation 4a: b = 133 + e - g = 133 + e -73 = 60 + e.

From equation 3a: -b - c - f + g = -476.

We know g=73, so:

-b - c - f = -476 -73 = -549.

But b =60 + e.

So,

-(60 + e) - c - f = -549 → -60 - e - c - f = -549.

Which simplifies to:

-e - c - f = -549 +60 = -489.

Which again matches with c + e + f =489.

So, everything is consistent.

Now, from equation 5: c + e + f =489.

From equation 2: d =234 - e - f.

So, d =234 - (e + f).

But since c + e + f =489, e + f =489 -c.

So,

d =234 - (489 - c) =234 -489 + c = c -255.

So, d = c -255.

But since d is the number of people owning exactly three things (C,D,G), it must be non-negative. So,

c -255 ≥ 0 → c ≥255.

Similarly, from equation 1: a + b + c =437.

We have b=60 + e.

So,

a =437 - b - c =437 - (60 + e) - c =377 - e - c.

We also have from equation 3: a + d + e + g =195.

We can substitute a=377 - e - c, d= c -255, g=73.

So,

(377 - e - c) + (c -255) + e +73 =195.

Simplify:

377 -e -c +c -255 +e +73 =195.

The e and c terms cancel out:

377 -255 +73 =195.

Calculate:

377 -255 =122 → 122 +73=195. Which matches.

So, the calculations are consistent.

Now, to find c, we can use the fact that d =c -255 ≥0 → c ≥255.

Also, since a=377 - e - c must be non-negative, and e is non-negative.

But without more information, we can't find exact values for a, b, c, d, e, f. But since the problem only asks for g, which is 73, that's our answer.


The number of residents of Aimeville who own all four items is **73**.
