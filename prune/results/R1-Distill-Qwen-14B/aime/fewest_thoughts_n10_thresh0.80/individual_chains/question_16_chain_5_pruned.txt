Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: 

Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Hmm. So the task is twofold. First, find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Then, using that prime, find the smallest positive integer \( m \) where \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Alright, let me start by understanding what's being asked. I need to find a prime \( p \) where \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \) for some \( n \). Then, find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \).

I think I should first check small primes to see if any satisfy this condition. The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let me check each one.

Starting with \( p = 2 \). Let's see if there's an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \). Let's compute \( n^4 \mod 4 \).

For \( n \) even: Let's say \( n = 2k \), then \( n^4 = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \). So \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), which isn't 0.

For \( n \) odd: Let's say \( n = 2k + 1 \). Then \( n^4 = (2k+1)^4 \). Let's compute \( (2k+1)^4 \mod 4 \). The expansion will have terms with factors of 2 or 4, except the last term, which is 1. So \( n^4 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \), which isn't 0 either. So \( p = 2 \) doesn't work.

Next, \( p = 3 \). Let's see if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 9 \) is possible.

Compute \( n^4 \) modulo 9 for \( n = 1, 2, ..., 8 \).

Compute each:

1: \(1^4 = 1 \mod 9\)
2: \(16 \mod 9 = 7\)
3: \(81 \mod 9 = 0\)
4: \(256 \mod 9\). 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, so 256-252=4. So 4 mod 9.
5: \(5^4 = 625 \mod 9\). 625 /9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod9.
6: \(6^4=1296. 1296/9=144, so 0 mod9.
7: \(7^4=2401\). 2401/9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7. So 7 mod9.
8: \(8^4=4096\). 4096/9: 9*455=4095, 4096-4095=1. So 1 mod9.

Looking for \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 9 \), which is equivalent to \( n^4 \equiv 8 \mod 9 \). But in our computations, none of the residues are 8. So \( p =3 \) also doesn't work.

Next prime is 5. Let's check if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 25 \). So \( n^4 \equiv 24 \mod 25 \).

To check if such an \( n \) exists, let's compute \( n^4 \mod 25 \) for \( n = 1 \) to 24.

Wait, that's a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that for primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p^2, certain conditions on p must hold. For example, if p ≡ 1 mod 8, then -1 is a quadratic residue, but for quartic residues, the conditions are more restrictive.

Alternatively, perhaps I can check if x^4 ≡ -1 mod 5 first, then lift using Hensel's lemma.

Wait, let me first check modulo 5. Does \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod 5 \) have a solution?

Compute \( x^4 \mod5 \):

1^4=1
2^4=16≡1
3^4=81≡1
4^4=256≡1 mod5.

So all x^4 ≡1 mod5. So -1 mod5 is 4, so no solution. Hence, no solution mod5, so certainly no solution mod25. So p=5 can't be the prime.

Next prime is 7.

Check if \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod7 \) has a solution.

Compute x^4 mod7 for x=1 to 6:

1^4=1
2^4=16≡2
3^4=81≡4
4^4=256≡4
5^4=625≡2
6^4=1296≡1 mod7.

So possible residues are 1,2,4. We're looking for -1 mod7, which is 6. Since none of the residues are 6, there's no solution mod7. So p=7 also can't be the prime.

Next prime is 11.

But wait, maybe I can recall that primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p must satisfy p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, and for -1 to be a quartic residue, the order of -1 must divide (p-1)/4.

Wait, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. The element -1 has order 2. So for -1 to be a quartic residue, the equation x^4 ≡ -1 must have a solution.

So the multiplicative order of x^4 would be a divisor of (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p implies that x^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of x divides 8 and also divides p-1. So 8 must divide p-1, meaning p ≡1 mod8.

So, primes p
