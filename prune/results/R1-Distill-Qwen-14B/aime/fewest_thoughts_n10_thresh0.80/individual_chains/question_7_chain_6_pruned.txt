Okay, so I have this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue with a 50-50 chance. So, each coloring is equally likely. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. So, the denominator of our probability will probably be 256.

Now, the problem is about rotating the octagon so that all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, we're looking for colorings where this is possible. Let me think about what that implies.

When we rotate the octagon, the coloring is shifted. So, for each rotation, the colors move to new positions. We need a rotation such that after the shift, every blue vertex is now on a red vertex. That is, the set of blue vertices is mapped to the set of red vertices via some rotation.

Wait, so if the octagon can be rotated to achieve this, then the set of blue points must be a rotation of the set of red points. But since red and blue are complements, the set of blue points is the complement of red points. So, the blue set must be a rotation of the red set, which is the same as saying the blue set is a shifted version of itself under some rotation.

But wait, that might not always be possible. So, the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a rotation (shift) of the set of red vertices. Since the octagon is regular, the rotations correspond to shifting by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.

So, for a given coloring, we need the blue set to be a shifted version of the red set. Since the red set is the complement of the blue set, this would mean that the blue set is fixed under some rotation, or more precisely, that the blue set is a union of orbits under some rotation.

But wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the coloring being symmetric under some rotation. So, for some rotation, the coloring is preserved when that rotation is applied. But
