Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder, respectively, when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Alright, so N is a four-digit number. The first thing I notice is that it's the greatest such number with a specific property. So, the plan is to find the largest four-digit number where changing any single digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7.

Let me break this down. Let's denote N as a four-digit number, which we can write as N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A being the thousands digit, B the hundreds, C the tens, and D the units digit.

The key property here is that if we replace any one of these digits with 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 should result in a number that's a multiple of 7.

So, for example, changing A to 1 gives us 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such four-digit number, we probably want N to be as large as possible. That suggests starting from 9999 and working our way down until we find a number that satisfies this condition. However, that might take a while, so maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about how changing each digit affects divisibility by 7. Remember that a number is divisible by 7 if, when you subtract twice the last digit from the rest of the number, the result is divisible by 7. Alternatively, we can use modular arithmetic to express the conditions.

First, let's express N as 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

When we change a digit to 1, let's see how that affects the number modulo 7.

For each digit position, replacing it with 1 gives a new number. Let's write equations for each case:

1. Replacing A with 1: The new number is 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's denote this as N1.

2. Replacing B with 1: The new number is 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Let's denote this as N2.

3. Replacing C with 1: The new number is 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Denote this as N3.

4. Replacing D with 1: The new number is 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1. Denote this as N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7. So, each must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me write out the congruences:

1. N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. N2 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. N3 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (1000A + 100B + 10 + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. N4 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Now, let's express N itself in terms of mod 7. Let's denote N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N ≡ 0 mod 7 is not necessarily required, but the modified numbers must be ≡ 0 mod 7.

Wait, but perhaps we can express these conditions in terms of N and see how each digit relates to others modulo 7.

Let me compute each N1, N2, N3, N4 in terms of N:

1. N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A)/1000 * something? Hmm, maybe that's not the easiest way.

Alternatively, note that:

N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Therefore, N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

Similarly, N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = 1000A + (N - 100B - 10C - D) + 100 + 10C + D = Not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute each modified number in terms of N and the digit being changed.

Let me think.

Changing A to 1: N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (100B + 10C + D).

But 100B + 10C + D = N - 1000A.

So, N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

Similarly, N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + (10C + D).

But 10C + D = (N - 1000A - 100B)/10.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me instead compute each N1, N2, N3, N4 modulo 7.

Because if N1 ≡ 0 mod 7, N2 ≡0 mod7, etc., then we can set up congruences.

So, let's compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod7.

Compute:

1000 / 7: 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So, 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 /7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So, 100≡2 mod7.

10/7=1*7=7, so 10≡3 mod7.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1 mod7.

So, let's write each N1, N2, N3, N4 mod7.

1. N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

N1 mod7 = (6 + 2B +3C + D) mod7 ≡0.

2. N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

N2 mod7 = (6A + 2 +3C + D) mod7 ≡0.

3. N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

N3 mod7 = (6A + 2B +3 + D) mod7 ≡0.

4. N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C +1.

N4 mod7 = (6A + 2B +3C +1) mod7 ≡0.

So, we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7  --> Equation (1)

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (2)

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (3)

4. 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (4)

Additionally, since N is as large as possible, let's aim for A=9, then B=9, etc., but we have constraints.

So, our goal is to find A, B, C, D (each from 0-9, A≠0) such that all four equations above are satisfied, and N is as large as possible.

Since we're looking for the largest N, we can start from 9999 and check each number, but since that's time-consuming, we can try to find constraints on the digits.

Let's see if we can express some variables in terms of others.

Let me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6A + 2 +3C + D) - (6 +2B +3C +D) = 6A +2 +3C +D -6 -2B -3C -D = 6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A - 2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as 6A -2B =4 +7k, for some integer k.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation (3) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(6A +2 +3C + D) - (6A +2B +3 +D) = 6A +2 +3C +D -6A -2B -3 -D = -2B +3C -1 ≡0 mod7.

So, -2B +3C -1 ≡0 mod7.

Which can be rewritten as 3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (3):

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6A +2B +3 +D) =6A +2B +3C +1 -6A -2B -3 -D = 3C -2 -D ≡0 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Let me note all the derived equations:

From Equation (2)-(1): 6A -2B ≡4 mod7. --> Equation (5)

From Equation (2)-(3): -2B +3C ≡1 mod7. --> Equation (6)

From Equation (4)-(3): 3C - D ≡2 mod7. --> Equation (7)

Also, let's see Equation (1): 6 +2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7. --> Equation (1)

And Equation (4):6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7. --> Equation (4)

Maybe we can express variables in terms of others.

Let me consider Equation (7): 3C - D ≡2 mod7 → D ≡3C -2 mod7.

Since D is a digit (0-9), D can be expressed as (3C -2) mod7, but we need to ensure that D is between 0 and 9.

Similarly, Equation (6): -2B +3C ≡1 mod7 → 3C ≡2B +1 mod7 → C ≡ (2B +1)/3 mod7. Wait, division in mod7. Since 3 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 3 mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So, C ≡5*(2B +1) mod7.

Compute 5*(2B +1) =10B +5 ≡3B +5 mod7. So, C ≡3B +5 mod7.

So, C = (3B +5) mod7. Since C is a digit (0-9), this gives possible values for C based on B.

Similarly, Equation (5): 6A -2B
