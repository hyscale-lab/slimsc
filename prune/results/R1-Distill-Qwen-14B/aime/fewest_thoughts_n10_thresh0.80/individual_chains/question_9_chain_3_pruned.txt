Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^(4y) is also equal to 10. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll write down the given equations to make it clearer:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember some logarithm properties that might help here. One of them is that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So, I can rewrite both equations using that property.

Starting with the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I think it might be helpful to express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other. I remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So substituting A into the equations:

1. x * A = 10
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

Now, I have a system of two equations with two variables, x and y, and the parameter A.

From equation 1, I can solve for x:

x = 10 / A.

From equation 2, let's solve for y:

4y * (1/A) = 10
=> 4y / A = 10
=> y = (10 * A) / 4
=> y = (5A)/2.

So, now I have expressions for x and y in terms of A:

x = 10/A
y = (5A)/2

But wait, I also have that A is log_x(y). Since A is log_x(y), I can write:

A = log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x)

But since I have expressions for x and y in terms of A, I can substitute them into this equation.

Let's substitute x = 10/A and y = (5A)/2 into A = ln(y)/ln(x):

A = ln( (5A)/2 ) / ln(10/A )

Hmm, this looks complicated, but perhaps I can manipulate it further.

Let me write it out:

A = ln( (5A)/2 ) / ln(10/A )

Let me denote B = A for simplicity, so:

B = ln( (5B)/2 ) / ln(10/B )

I can rewrite the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: ln( (5B)/2 ) = ln(5B) - ln(2) = ln(5) + ln(B) - ln(2)
Denominator: ln(10/B ) = ln(10) - ln(B)

So, the equation becomes:

B = [ln(5) + ln(B) - ln(2)] / [ln(10) - ln(B)]

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation in terms of B, which might be tricky to solve algebraically. Maybe I can find a substitution or see if I can find B such that both sides are equal.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of another approach without involving natural logarithms. Let's see.

Wait, another thought: since x and y are expressed in terms of A, maybe I can find a relationship between x and y that doesn't involve A.

From earlier, x = 10/A and y = (5A)/2.

Let me multiply x and y:

x * y = (10/A) * (5A/2) = (10 * 5 * A ) / (A * 2 ) = 50 / 2 = 25.

Oh! Wait, x * y is 25. Is that the answer? Let me verify if this makes sense.

Wait, but is that possible? Because I derived it without considering the equation A = ln(y)/ln(x). Did I make a mistake?

Wait no, wait a second. Because I substituted x and y in terms of A, but I also have another equation that relates x and y through A. So perhaps x * y is indeed 25, regardless of the value of A.

But let me think again. Let me check.

x = 10/A

y = (5A)/2

So, xy = (10/A) * (5A/2) = (10 * 5 * A ) / (2A ) = 50/2 =25.

Yes, the A's cancel out, so xy is 25. So, regardless of what A is, the product is 25. So, the answer is 25. But wait, I need to make sure that this is consistent with the original equations, and that such x and y exist.

But perhaps I should check if this holds. Let me try to see.

So, suppose xy =25.

Let me see if I can find x and y such that both log_x(y^x)=10 and log_y(x^{4y})
