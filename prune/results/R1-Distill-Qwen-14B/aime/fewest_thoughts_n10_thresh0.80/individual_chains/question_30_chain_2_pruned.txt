Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning that ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, the powers of ω cycle every 13 steps. That might be useful later.

The product is given by ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, this is a product of 13 terms because k goes from 0 to 12. Let me see if I can simplify each term or find a pattern.

Looking at each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Maybe I can factor it or express it in a different form. Let me rewrite it:

Let me denote x = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². So, it's a quadratic in x: x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, I can try to factor this or find its roots.

The quadratic equation x² - 2x + 2 = 0 has discriminant D = 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are (2 ± 2i)/2 = 1 ± i. So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). That's useful. So, each term in the product can be written as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), where x = ω^k.

So, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Wait, since we're multiplying over all k from 0 to 12, perhaps we can separate the two factors:

∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) * ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, it's the product of two products. Each product is over all ω^k, where ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. So, the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) is known in complex analysis as the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at a specific point. Specifically, I remember that the product ∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - ω^k) is equal to x^n - 1, since the roots of x^n - 1 are exactly the nth roots of unity. So, perhaps I can use that here.

In this case, n = 13, so ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if I set x = (1 + i), then ∏_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, ∏_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - i) - ω^k) = (1 - i)^13 - 1.

But wait, in our case, the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) because (ω^k - a) = - (a - ω^k). Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. So, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = - ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = - (a^13 - 1).

So, that means:

First product: ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = - ((1 + i)^13 - 1)

Second product: ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = - ((1 - i)^13 - 1)

Therefore, the original product is:

[- ((1 + i)^13 - 1)] * [- ((1 - i)^13 - 1)] = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]

So, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let's compute that. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctangent(1/1) = π/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}

Let me compute (sqrt(2))^13:

sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the exponents:

13 * π/4 = (12 + 1) * π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π/4 + 3π. But since e^{iθ} is periodic with period 2π, 3π is equivalent to π, so e^{i(13π/4)} = e^{i(π/4 + 2π * 1 + π)} = e^{i(π/4 + π)} = e^{i5π/4}.

Similarly, e^{-i13π/4} = e^{-i(π/4 + 3π)} = e^{-i(π/4 + π)} = e^{-i5π/4}.

Wait, let me think again:

13π/4 is the same as 13π/4 - 2π * 1 = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, -13π/4 is the same as -13π/4 + 2π * 2 = -13π/4 + 16π/4 = 3π/4.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: let's see, e^{iθ} is periodic with period 2π, so adding or subtracting multiples of 2π doesn't change its value.

So, 13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π/4 + 3π. But 3π is equal to π + 2π, which is equivalent to π modulo 2π. So, 13π/4 ≡ π/4 + π = 5π/4. Similarly, -13π/4 is the same as -5π/4, but adding 2π gives 3π/4.

Wait, let me compute e^{i13π/4}:

13π/4 = 3π + π/4, which is the same as π/4 + π, so it's π/4 in the third quadrant. So, e^{i13π/4} = cos(13π/4) + i sin(13π/4) = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, e^{-i13π/4} = cos(-13π/4) + i sin(-13π/4) = cos(13π/4) - i sin(13π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute (1 + i)^13 directly.

Alternatively, since (1 + i) has modulus sqrt(2) and angle π/4, raising it to the 13th power gives modulus (sqrt(2))^13 and angle 13*(π/4). As we saw, modulus is 2^{13/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle is 13π/4, which is 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to π/4 in the third quadrant. So, the angle can be represented as π/4 + π = 5π/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So, e^{i13π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, e^{-i13π/4} = cos(-13π/4) + i sin(-13π/4) = cos(13π/4) - i sin(13π/4) = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

Wait
