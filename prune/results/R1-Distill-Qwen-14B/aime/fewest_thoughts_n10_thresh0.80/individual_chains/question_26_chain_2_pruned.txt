Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

We have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, we have to find m + n.

Alright, so let's try to visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, drawing a line from A through D to intersect the circle again at P. We need to find AP.

Hmm, okay. So, first, maybe I should draw a rough sketch to see the problem. But since I can't draw here, I'll try to imagine it.

I remember that the tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if ω is the circumcircle of ABC, then the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center of ω. Similarly for the tangent at C. So, the point D is the intersection of two tangents at B and C.

Wait, so D is the ex-pole of BC? Or is it the ex-similicenter or something? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe D is the ex-pole related to BC because it's the intersection of two tangents. Alternatively, D is the ex-pole of the circle with respect to the line BC, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that D is called the ex-pole of BC, and BD and CD are tangents from D to the circle. So, BD = CD because they are both tangents from D to ω.

Wait, no, actually, BD is the tangent at B, and CD is the tangent at C, so they are both tangents from D to the circle, but since they are tangents at specific points, BD and CD are both equal in length because the lengths of tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, BD = CD.

So, triangle BDC is an isosceles triangle with BD = CD.

Hmm, okay. So, D is a point outside the circle ω, from which two tangents are drawn to ω at points B and C.

Now, line AD is drawn from A through D and intersects ω again at P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with ω, and we need to find AP.

So, AP is the length from A to P, which is a point on the circumcircle.

I think I can approach this with power of a point or perhaps some properties of similar triangles or harmonic division.

Let me recall that the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 (or DC^2, since they're equal). Also, since AD passes through D and intersects ω at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω is DP * DA = DB^2.

So, power of point D: DP * DA = DB^2.

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate DA and DP.

But wait, AP is the segment from A to P, so AP = AD - DP? Or is it AD + DP? Wait, no, actually, point D is outside the circle, and AD passes through D and intersects the circle at A and P. So, the order is A, then P, then D. So, AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, AP = AD - PD.

Wait, but if that's the case, then using power of a point, we have DP * DA = DB^2.

But AP = AD - PD. Let me denote AP as x, so PD = AD - x.

Wait, but power of point: DP * DA = DB^2.

So, (AD - x) * AD = DB^2.

Hmm, but I don't know AD or DB yet. So, maybe I need to find AD and DB.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express AD in terms of something else.

Wait, maybe using triangle ABC, I can find some angles or other lengths.

Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, so triangle ABC has sides 5,9,10.

First, maybe I should compute the circumradius of triangle ABC because ω is its circumcircle.

The formula for circumradius R is (a b c)/(4 Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So, sides a=5, b=9, c=10.

First, compute the area Δ using Heron's formula.

s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[12*42] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt[504]. Let me factor 504.

504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is not integer.

Wait, 504 divided by 8 is 63, which is 9*7. So, 504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 *7 = 2^3 * 3^2 *7.

So sqrt[504] = sqrt[2^3 * 3^2 *7] = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14).

Wait, let me check that again.

sqrt(2^3) is 2*sqrt(2); sqrt(3^2) is 3; sqrt(7) is sqrt(7).

So, sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Yes, that's correct.

So Δ = 6*sqrt(14).

Then, the circumradius R is (a b c)/(4 Δ) = (5 *9 *10)/(4 *6*sqrt(14)).

Compute numerator: 5*9=45, 45*10=450.

Denominator: 4*6=24, 24*sqrt(14).

So R = 450/(24*sqrt(14)).

Simplify 450/24: 450 ÷ 6 = 75; 24 ÷6=4. So 75/4.

So R = (75/4)/sqrt(14) = 75/(4*sqrt(14)).

Rationalize the denominator: 75*sqrt(14)/(4*14) = 75*sqrt(14)/56.

So R = (75√14)/56.

Hmm, I wonder if that's correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should do R = (a b c)/(4 Δ) again.

a=5, b=9, c=10.

a*b*c = 5*9*10 = 450.

Δ = 6√14.

So 4Δ = 24√14.

So R = 450/(24√14) = (450/24)/√14.

450 divided by 24: let's see, 24*18 = 432, 450-432=18, so 18.75? No, wait, 24*18=432, 24*19=456, which is larger. So 450 = 24*18 + 18, which is 18 and 18/24, which is 18.75? Wait, no, 18 + 18/24 is 18 + 3/4 = 18.75. Hmm, but 24*18.75=24*(18 + 0.75)=432 + 18=450. Yes, right.

So 450/24 = 18.75 = 75/4.

So R = (75/4)/√14 = 75/(4√14) = (75√14)/56.

Yes, correct.

So R is 75√14 /56.

Okay, that's the circumradius.

Now, back to the problem.

We have the tangents from D to ω at B and C, so D lies on the tangent lines at B and C, so BD is tangent at B, CD is tangent at C.

Therefore, DB = DC, as they are both tangents from D.

Power of D with respect to ω is DB^2 = DC^2 = (distance from D to center)^2 - R^2.

But we don't know where D is exactly, so perhaps it's better to find coordinates.

Maybe assigning coordinates to the triangle ABC might help. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B somewhere in the plane, and point A somewhere else.

Given that AC=10, BC=9, AB=5.

Wait, if C is at (0,0), then point A can be at (10,0) since AC=10. Then point B is somewhere else.

We can compute coordinates of B using the distances.

So, let's set coordinate system with C at (0,0), A at (10,0), and B at (x,y). Then, AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

So, distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 9 => x² + y² = 81.

Distance from A to B is 5: sqrt( (x -10)^2 + y^2 ) =5 => (x-10)^2 + y²=25.

Subtract the first equation from the second:

(x-10)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) =25 -81 => x² -20x +100 + y² -x² - y² = -56 => -20x +100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x=156/20=39/5=7.8.

So x=7.8, which is 39/5.

Then, from first equation, x² + y²=81, so y²=81 - x²=81 - (39/5)^2.

Compute (39/5)^2 = (1521)/25=60.84.

So y²=81 -60.84=20.16=504/25.

So y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504=16*31.5? No, 16*31=496, 496+8=504, so 16*31.5=504.

Wait, 504=16*31.5, but 31.5 is not integer. Alternatively, 504= 4*126=4*9*14= 4*9*14, so sqrt(504)=sqrt(4*9*14)=2*3*sqrt(14)=6√14.

So y=6√14 /5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates:

C=(0,0), A=(10,0), B=(39/5, 6√14/5).

Now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

Wait, the tangent at C is easy because C is at (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. But wait, O is the circumradius center, which I need to find.

Wait, maybe instead of finding O, since I have coordinates of A, B, and C, I can find the equation of the tangent at B and tangent at C, then find their intersection point D.

Yes, that might be a way.

So, first, let's find the equation of tangent at C.

Since C is (0,0), the radius OC is from O to C, which is just the vector from O to (0,0). But since we don't have O's coordinates, perhaps we can find the equation of the tangent at C differently.

Wait, alternatively, the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. But without knowing O, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, alternatively, I can find the equation of the tangent at C. Since the tangent at C is perpendicular to the line OC, and C is on the tangent.

Wait, maybe using the condition that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

But without knowing O, perhaps another method is better.

Wait, perhaps parametric equations or using the condition that the tangent line satisfies a certain condition.

Alternatively, since I know three points on the circle (A, B, C), maybe I can find the equation of the circle, then find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then find their intersection D.

Yes, that sounds feasible.

So, let's find the equation of the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

We have three points: A=(10,0), B=(39/5, 6√14/5), C=(0,0).

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Since C=(0,0) is on the circle, substituting into the equation: 0 + 0 + 0 +0 + c =0 => c=0.

So the equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy =0.

Now, plug in point A=(10,0):

10² +0 +2g*10 +0 =0 => 100 +20g=0 => 20g= -100 => g= -5.

So the equation is x² + y² -10x + 2fy=0.

Now, plug in point B=(39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + 2f*(6√14/5) =0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

10*(39/5)= 78.

2f*(6√14/5) = (12√14 f)/5.

So putting them together:

1521/25 +504/25 -78 + (12√14 f)/5 =0.

Compute 1521 +504 = 2025.

So 2025/25 = 81.

So equation becomes: 81 -78 + (12√14 f)/5 =0.

Simplify: 3 + (12√14 f)/5 =0.

So (12√14 f)/5 = -3.

Multiply both sides by 5: 12√14 f = -15.

Divide both sides by 12√14: f= (-15)/(12√14) = (-5)/(4√14).

Rationalize denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14.

f= (-5√14)/(4*14) = (-5√14)/56.

So f= -5√14/56.

So the equation of the circle ω is:

x² + y² -10x + 2*(-5√14/56)y =0.

Simplify: x² + y² -10x - (10√14/56)y =0.

Simplify the coefficient of y: 10√14/56 = 5√14/28.

So equation: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Alternatively, write it as:

x² -10x + y² - (5√14/28)y =0.

Now, to find the tangent at point C=(0,0).

The tangent at C is the line perpendicular to the radius OC. But since C is at (0,0), the radius OC is from center (g, f) to (0,0). Wait, in the general equation, the center is at (-g, -f). Wait, wait, in the general equation x² + y² +2gx + 2fy +c=0, the center is
