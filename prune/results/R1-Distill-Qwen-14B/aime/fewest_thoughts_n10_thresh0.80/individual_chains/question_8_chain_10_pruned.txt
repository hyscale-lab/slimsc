Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let me try to break it down.

First, let's understand what we're dealing with. We have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both. Since all are nonnegative integers, maybe symmetry can help here.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that it's symmetric in a, b, c. Each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. So maybe I can factor or rewrite this expression in a way that relates to the first equation.

Let me think about expanding (a + b + c)². I know that's equal to a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). But wait, in the second equation, I have a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. That looks like a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Let me write that out:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others.

So the expression becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So the entire expression is equal to 6,000,000.

Putting it all together:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 300:

(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000

Wait, that doesn't seem very helpful. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can express c as 300 - a - b, and substitute into the second equation. Let's try that.

Let c = 300 - a - b.

Substitute into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Expanding each term:

a²b + a²(300 - a - b) + b²a + b²(300 - a - b) + (300 - a - b)^2 a + (300 - a - b)^2 b = 6,000,000

That's a bit messy, but let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute a²b + a²c:

a²b + a²c = a²b + a²(300 - a - b) = a²b + 300a² - a³ - a²b = 300a² - a³

Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²a + b²(300 - a - b) = b²a + 300b² - a b² - b³ = 300b² - b³

Now, the other two terms: c²a + c²b = a c² + b c² = c²(a + b) = (300 - a - b)^2 (a + b)

Let me compute (300 - a - b)^2:

(300 - a - b)^2 = 300^2 - 2*300*(a + b) + (a + b)^2 = 90000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b²

So, c²(a + b) = [90000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b²] * (a + b)

Let me denote S = a + b. Then, c = 300 - S.

So, c²(a + b) = (90000 - 600S + a² + 2ab + b²) * S

But a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)^2 = S². So this becomes:

(90000 - 600S + S²) * S = 90000S - 600S² + S³

Putting it all together, the entire second equation becomes:

[300a² - a³] + [300b² - b³] + [90000S - 600S² + S³] = 6,000,000

Wait, let's write all the terms:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 90000S - 600S² + S³ = 6,000,000

But S = a + b, so let's substitute S:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 90000(a + b) - 600(a + b)^2
