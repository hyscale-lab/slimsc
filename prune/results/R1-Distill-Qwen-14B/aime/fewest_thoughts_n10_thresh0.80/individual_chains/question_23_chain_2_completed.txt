Alright, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right. The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that's less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. But wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, no, wait—actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Okay, so that's correct.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the diagonals are the lines along which the vertices of the rhombus lie. So, points A and C lie on one diagonal, and points B and D lie on the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, if A is (p, q), then C must be (-p, -q). Similarly, if B is (r, s), then D is (-r, -s).

But wait, since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, this makes sense. So, all four points are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if A is (p, q), then C is (-p, -q), and similarly for B and D.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the sides can be calculated using the lengths of the diagonals.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the diagonals. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the area is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Each side is equal to sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). But since all sides are equal, that's the length of each side.

But in our problem, we need to find BD², which is the square of the length of the diagonal BD. Wait, but BD is one of the diagonals, right? So, if BD is one diagonal, then its length squared is BD². So, I need to find the maximum lower bound for BD² across all such rhombi. The greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Wait, so perhaps I need to find the infimum of BD², or maybe the minimal possible BD²? Or maybe it's the supremum of something else?

Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that is, find the maximum lower bound for BD². So, it's like the infimum of BD², but as a real number that is strictly less than BD² for all rhombi. So, essentially, the minimal possible BD² is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is that infimum.

Wait, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a matter of parametrizing the points on the hyperbola and then imposing the rhombus conditions.

Let me try that approach.

So, let's parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola.

Since the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, let's use hyperbola parametrization.

For hyperbola, a standard parametrization is (a secθ, b tanθ). So, here, a² = 20, so a = sqrt(20), and b² = 24, so b = sqrt(24). So, points can be written as (sqrt(20) secθ, sqrt(24) tanθ).

But since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps we can consider points in the first quadrant and then reflect them.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use coordinates (x, y) that satisfy the hyperbola equation.

Let me denote point A as (x, y). Then, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B can be (u, v), so point D is (-u, -v).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider vectors.

Let me think in terms of vectors. Let me denote vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors OA and OB should satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, OA · OB = 0? Because the diagonals are perpendicular.

Wait, no, wait. The diagonals are AC and BD. So, vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). Wait, but the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and from B to D. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, AC · BD = 0.

So, AC is (C - A) = (-2x, -2y), BD is (D - B) = (-2u, -2v). So, their dot product should be zero.

Dot product: (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 4xu + 4yv = 0. So, xu + yv = 0.

So, that's one condition.

Another condition is that all sides of the rhombus are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc.

But perhaps it's easier to use vectors. Since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same length and the angle between them should be such that the figure closes properly. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since the sides are equal, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude.

Wait, let me think.

Point A is (x, y), point B is (u, v), point C is (-x, -y), point D is (-u, -v).

So, the sides are:

AB: from A to B: (u - x, v - y)

BC: from B to C: (-x - u, -y - v)

CD: from C to D: (-u + x, -v + y)

DA: from D to A: (x + u, y + v)

In a rhombus, all these vectors should have the same magnitude.

So, |AB| = |BC| = |CD| = |DA|.

So, let's compute |AB|² and |BC|².

|AB|² = (u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2

|BC|² = (-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2

Setting |AB|² = |BC|²:

(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2

Expanding both sides:

Left: u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y²

Right: u² + 2ux + x² + v² + 2vy + y²

Subtracting left from right:

( u² + 2ux + x² + v² + 2vy + y² ) - ( u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y² ) = 4ux + 4vy = 0

So, 4ux + 4vy = 0 ⇒ ux + vy = 0

But earlier, we had from the diagonals being perpendicular: xu + yv = 0.

So, that's consistent. So, the condition from the sides being equal gives the same condition as the diagonals being perpendicular.

So, that condition is necessary, but is it sufficient? Probably, since the sides being equal and diagonals perpendicular should define a rhombus.

So, we have that xu + yv = 0.

Additionally, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

So, let me recap.

We have points A(x, y) and B(u, v) on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

They satisfy xu + yv = 0.

We need to find BD², which is the square of the distance between B and D. But D is (-u, -v), so BD is the distance between (u, v) and (-u, -v). So, BD is sqrt( (u - (-u))² + (v - (-v))² ) = sqrt( (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 ) = 2 sqrt(u² + v²). So, BD² = (2 sqrt(u² + v²))² = 4(u² + v²).

So, BD² = 4(u² + v²).

So, our goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi, which implies we need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi, and then take the greatest number less than that infimum.

Wait, no. Wait, if the question is asking for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi, that would be the infimum of BD². Because for all rhombi, BD² is greater than or equal to some number, and that number is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is the infimum.

So, we need to find the minimal possible value of BD², which is 4(u² + v²), given the constraints.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing 4(u² + v²) subject to:

1. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

2. xu + yv = 0

And since point A is (x, y) on the hyperbola, x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Hmm, so we have two points on the hyperbola, A(x, y) and B(u, v), such that xu + yv = 0.

We need to find the minimal BD², which is 4(u² + v²). So, the minimal value of u² + v², times 4.

So, let's think about how to minimize u² + v², given that u²/20 - v²/24 = 1 and xu + yv = 0, with x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

This seems like a constrained optimization problem. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola and use the condition xu + yv = 0.

Let me try parametrizing points A and B.

Let me use the parametrization for hyperbola: (sqrt(20) secθ, sqrt(24) tanθ). So, A can be (sqrt(20) secθ, sqrt(24) tanθ), and B can be (sqrt(20) secφ, sqrt(24) tanφ). Then, the condition xu + yv = 0 becomes:

sqrt(20) secθ * sqrt(20) secφ + sqrt(24) tanθ * sqrt(24) tanφ = 0.

Simplify that:

20 secθ secφ + 24 tanθ tanφ = 0.

So,

20 secθ secφ = -24 tanθ tanφ

Divide both sides by secθ secφ:

20 = -24 (sinθ sinφ)/(cosθ cosφ) * (cosθ cosφ)/(1)

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, let me write tanθ = sinθ / cosθ, and secθ = 1 / cosθ.

So, 20 * (1 / cosθ cosφ) + 24 * (sinθ sinφ) / (cosθ cosφ) = 0.

Multiply both sides by cosθ cosφ:

20 + 24 sinθ sinφ = 0

So,

24 sinθ sinφ = -20

So,

sinθ sinφ = -20/24 = -5/6.

Hmm, interesting. So, sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Now, our goal is to find u² + v², which for point B is (sqrt(20) secφ)^2 + (sqrt(24) tanφ)^2.

Compute that:

20 sec²φ + 24 tan²φ.

We can write this in terms of sinφ and cosφ.

Recall that sec²φ = 1 + tan²φ, so:

20(1 + tan²φ) + 24 tan²φ = 20 + 44 tan²φ.

So, u² + v² = 20 + 44 tan²φ.

We need to minimize this expression subject to sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Wait, but we have two variables θ and φ, and a relation between them. So, perhaps we can express tan²φ in terms of θ.

Alternatively, maybe find a relationship between θ and φ.

We know that sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Let me denote that as equation (1): sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

We also know that points A and B are on the hyperbola, so their parameters θ and φ are related.

Wait, but perhaps we can express sinφ in terms of sinθ, then write tan²φ in terms of sinθ.

Alternatively, let's express tan²φ = (sin²φ)/(cos²φ) = (sin²φ)/(1 - sin²φ).

From equation (1), sinφ = (-5)/(6 sinθ).

So, sin²φ = 25/(36 sin²θ).

Hence, tan²φ = [25/(36 sin²θ)] / [1 - 25/(36 sin²θ)].

Simplify:

tan²φ = [25/(36 sin²θ)] / [ (36 sin²θ -25)/(36 sin²θ) ) ] = 25 / (36 sin²θ -25).

So, tan²φ = 25 / (36 sin²θ -25).

So, u² + v² = 20 + 44 * [25 / (36 sin²θ -25) ].

So, that's 20 + (44*25)/(36 sin²θ -25) = 20 + 1100/(36 sin²θ -25).

So, now, we have u² + v² expressed in terms of sin²θ.

So, let me denote t = sin²θ.

Since sinθ is real, t ∈ (0,1], because θ is a real parameter.

So, t ∈ (0,1].

So, u² + v² = 20 + 1100/(36 t -25).

Wait, but 36 t - 25 must be positive because in the expression for tan²φ, the denominator 36 sin²θ -25 must be positive because tan²φ is positive (as squared).

So, 36 t -25 > 0 ⇒ t > 25/36 ≈ 0.6944.

So, t must be greater than 25/36.

So, t ∈ (25/36, 1].

So, now, we have u² + v² = 20 + 1100/(36 t -25), where t ∈ (25/36, 1].

We need to find the minimum value of u² + v².

So, since 1100 is positive, and the denominator (36 t -25) is positive, the second term is positive. So, u² + v² is 20 plus a positive term.

To minimize u² + v², we need to minimize the second term, which is 1100/(36 t -25). To minimize that, we need to maximize the denominator, because it's positive. So, maximizing 36 t -25 will minimize the fraction.

The denominator 36 t -25 is maximized when t is maximized, which is t=1.

So, when t =1, denominator is 36*1 -25 =11, so u² + v² = 20 + 1100/11 = 20 + 100 = 120.

On the other hand, when t approaches 25/36 from above, the denominator approaches 0, so the fraction 1100/(36 t -25) approaches infinity, making u² + v² approach infinity.

So, the minimal value of u² + v² is 120.

So, BD² = 4(u² + v²) = 4 * 120 = 480.

Wait, but wait. Hold on a second. Because the minimal u² + v² is 120, so BD² is 480. But the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, is 480 the minimal BD²? Because if that's the minimal, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, since BD² can be as small as 480. But wait, no, because the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if the minimal BD² is 480, then any number less than 480 would be less than all BD². But the greatest such number would be 480 itself, but since it's not less than BD² for all rhombi (since BD² can be equal to 480), the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum, which is 480, but since it's attainable, it's the minimum.

Wait, but hold on. If BD² can be as small as 480, then the infimum is 480. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, but since BD² can be equal to 480, that's not "less than." So, perhaps the infimum is 480, but it's not attained; perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in our calculation, when t=1, u² + v²=120, which gives BD²=480. So, BD² can be 480. So, the infimum is 480, meaning that BD² is always at least 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is the infimum, which is 480, but since BD² can be equal to 480, then 480 is not less than BD² for all rhombi because for the rhombus where BD²=480, it's equal. So, perhaps the answer is 480, but since we need a number less than BD² for all rhombi, the answer is 480. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 480 is attainable. So, perhaps the infimum is 480, but the problem asks for the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, which would be 480, but since it's attainable, it's not less than all BD². Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me double-check.

We had u² + v² = 20 + 1100/(36 t -25), with t ∈ (25/36,1]. So, when t=1, u² + v²=20 + 1100/(36*1 -25)=20 + 1100/11=20+100=120. So, BD²=4*(120)=480. So, yes, BD² can be as small as 480.

But, can BD² be smaller? Let me think. If t approaches 25/36 from above, then 36 t approaches 25, so 36 t -25 approaches 0, so 1100/(36 t -25) approaches infinity, making u² + v² approach infinity, so BD² approaches infinity. When t increases, approaching 1, BD² approaches 480.

So, the minimal BD² is 480, so the infimum is 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, but since BD² can be equal to 480, that's not less than all BD². So, perhaps the answer is 480, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be as small as 480, and can be larger, then for all rhombi, BD² is at least 480. So, 480 is the infimum. So, any number less than 480 would be less than BD² for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 480 itself. But since BD² can be exactly 480, 480 is not less than BD² for that particular rhombus. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is the infimum, which is 480, but since we can't have a number greater than 480 that's less than all BD², the answer must be 480.

Wait, but that can't be. Because if BD² can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD² for that rhombus. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi must be less than 480, but approaching 480 from below.

Wait, but I think my reasoning was that BD² is minimized at 480, so any number less than 480 would be less than BD² for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is approaching 480. However, since 480 is attainable, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480. But wait, that contradicts because for the rhombus with BD²=480, the number we choose must be less than 480.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me check.

Wait, is BD²=480 attainable? Let me see.

When t=1, sin²θ=1, so sinθ=±1. So, θ=π/2 or 3π/2.

So, point A would be (sqrt(20) sec(π/2), sqrt(24) tan(π/2)).

Wait, but sec(π/2) is undefined, as cos(π/2)=0. So, that's a problem.

So, t=1 corresponds to θ=π/2 or 3π/2, but then point A would be at infinity, which isn't allowed because hyperbola points are finite.

Wait, so perhaps t cannot be 1. So, t must be less than 1, but approaching 1. So, the minimal BD² is approaching 480, but not actually reaching it. So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never actually reaching it. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but if BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480, then 480 is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480. But since BD² can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less, then 480 is the greatest lower bound.

Wait, but actually, if BD² can approach 480 from above, then the infimum is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480. Because any number greater than 480 would not be less than BD² for some rhombus where BD² is just above 480. But since BD² can be as close to 480 as we like, the number must be 480. But no, 480 is not less than BD² for all rhombi, because for some rhombi, BD² is exactly 480. Wait, but if BD² cannot be less than 480, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Given that BD² can be as small as 480 and as large as infinity, then the minimal value is 480. So, any number less than 480 is less than BD² for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 480. However, since BD² can be exactly 480, 480 is not less than BD² for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is the infimum, which is 480, but since it's attainable, the number has to be less than 480. But how?

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the minimal BD² is 80, not 480. Let me check my earlier steps.

Wait, when t approaches 25/36 from above, u² + v² approaches infinity, so BD² approaches infinity. When t approaches 1, u² + v² approaches 120, so BD² approaches 480.

Wait, but if t can't be 1, because that would make point A go to infinity, then the minimal BD² is just above 480. So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, the minimal BD² is 480, but it's not actually achieved.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but never less than 480. So, any number less than 480 is less than BD² for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 480.

Wait, but if BD² is always at least 480, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be any number less than 480. But the question is asking for the greatest such number, so that's 480. But since BD² can be exactly 480, 480 is not less than BD² for that particular rhombus.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that t can approach 1. Let me check.

When t approaches 1, sinθ approaches 1, which would mean that point A approaches (sqrt(20) secθ, sqrt(24) tanθ). But as θ approaches π/2, secθ approaches infinity, and tanθ approaches infinity. So, point A would be at infinity, which is not allowed. So, t cannot reach 1, so t is strictly less than 1. Therefore, the minimal BD² is approached as t approaches 1, but never actually reaches 480. So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained.

Therefore, BD² can be as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because for any ε > 0, there exists a rhombus with BD² < 480 + ε, but BD² is always at least 480.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the infimum is 480, so BD² ≥ 480 for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD² just above 480, making the number not less than BD² for all rhombi. But since BD² is always ≥480, the number 480 is the greatest lower bound.

But the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, since BD² is always ≥480, the number 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, the answer is 480.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that t cannot reach 1, so BD² cannot reach 480. So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, BD² is always greater than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because BD² is always greater than 480, and 480 is the infimum.

So, I think the answer is 480.


The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all rhombi \( ABCD \) inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:
   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin and symmetric about both axes.
   - The rhombus \( ABCD \) has its vertices on the hyperbola and diagonals intersecting at the origin.
   - In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

2. **Parametrization of Points**:
   - Points \( A \) and \( B \) on the hyperbola can be parametrized as \( A(x, y) \) and \( B(u, v) \), satisfying \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1 \).
   - The condition for perpendicular diagonals gives \( xu + yv = 0 \).

3. **Expression for \( BD^2 \)**:
   - The length of diagonal \( BD \) is \( 2\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} \), so \( BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2) \).
   - Using the parametrization, \( u^2 + v^2 = 20 + 44 \tan^2\phi \), where \( \phi \) is the parameter for point \( B \).

4. **Optimization**:
   - The condition \( \sin\theta \sin\phi = -\frac{5}{6} \) relates the parameters \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) of points \( A \) and \( B \).
   - Minimizing \( u^2 + v^2 \) leads to the minimal value of \( 120 \), achieved as \( \theta \) approaches \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The minimal \( BD^2 \) is \( 4 \times 120 = 480 \).
   - Since \( BD^2 \) can be arbitrarily close to \( 480 \) but never less than it, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is \( 480 \).

\boxed{480}
