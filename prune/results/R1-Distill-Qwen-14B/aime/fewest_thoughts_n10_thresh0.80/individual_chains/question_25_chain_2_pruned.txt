Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we're dealing with a set of residents in Aimeville, and we're given information about how many own different items. The goal is to find how many own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. 

First, let me list out all the given numbers to get a clear picture. There are 900 residents in total. 

- Number of residents owning a diamond ring (let's call this D) is 195.
- Number owning a set of golf clubs (G) is 367.
- Number owning a garden spade (S) is 562.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so that's 900.

Wait, so C is universal here. Every resident owns C. That's an important point. So, the bag of candy hearts is something everyone has. So, in terms of sets, C is the universal set.

Now, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're to find the number who own all four.

Hmm, so I think this is an inclusion-exclusion problem. Since we're dealing with multiple sets and their intersections, I should recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. But wait, since everyone has the candy hearts, maybe we can model this as three sets (D, G, S) within the universal set C.

Wait, but let's think in terms of the principle. The inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is a bit complex, but perhaps since we have some information about exactly two and exactly three, we can approach it differently.

Let me denote:
- a = number of people owning exactly two items.
- b = number owning exactly three items.
- c = number owning all four items.

We know that a = 437, b = 234, and we need to find c.

Wait, but how does this fit into the inclusion-exclusion formula? Let me recall that the formula for the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But wait, in our case, C is the universal set. So, every resident owns C. So, that simplifies things a bit because any intersection involving C would just be the other set. For example, D ∩ C is just D, since all D owners also own C. Wait, but wait, actually, no. Because in reality, not everyone who owns D necessarily owns C. Wait, no, the problem states that everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, C is the universal set. So, every resident is in C.

Okay, that's a crucial point. So, C is the universal set. So, any intersection with C is just the other set. So, D ∩ C is D, G ∩ C is G, S ∩ C is S, and so on.

Wait, but that might not affect the formula much. Let me think. Alternatively, since C is universal, perhaps it's better to model this as the three sets D, G, S, all within the universal set C.

But let me think again. Let's think about the problem in terms of the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets (since C is universal, perhaps we can ignore it for now, but we have to factor it in when considering the fourth item). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe it's better to represent it as four sets but with C being universal. So, the total number of residents is 900, which is the size of C.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the problem in terms of the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets D, G, S, each within the universal set C. So, the formula would be:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But since C is universal, the total number of people not owning any of D, G, or S would be zero because everyone owns C. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because D, G, S are subsets of C, so the union D ∪ G ∪ S could be less than C. Wait, but in our problem, some people might not own D, G, or S, but they still own C. So, the total number of people in C is 900, which includes everyone, regardless of D, G, S.

So, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S would be |D ∪ G ∪ S|, which is less than or equal to 900. But actually, because all residents own C, the people not owning D, G, or S would be 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S|.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Let me think about the given data. We have the total number of residents who own exactly two items and exactly three items. So, perhaps we can use that to calculate the required overlaps.

Wait, let me think about the formula for exactly two and
