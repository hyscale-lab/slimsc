Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, arranged such that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram to understand the setup. So, rectangles ABCD and EFGH. Let me recall that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles.

So, rectangle ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. Given that BC = 16 and AB = 107, so rectangle ABCD has sides of length 16 and 107. Similarly, EF = 184 and FG = 17, so rectangle EFGH has sides 184 and 17.

Wait, but EF and FG are sides of rectangle EFGH, so if EF = 184, then GH = 184 as well, and FG = 17, so EH = 17. Similarly, in ABCD, AB = 107, so CD = 107, and BC = 16, so AD = 16.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line. Let me think about how these rectangles are positioned. Since D and C are adjacent vertices of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are adjacent vertices of EFGH, maybe the rectangles are placed such that this line D-E-C-F is a common side or something?

Wait, no. Because D, E, C, F being collinear suggests that they lie on a straight line in that order. So, point D is connected to E, then E to C, then C to F. Hmm.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That might come into play with some cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Coordinates might help me visualize the problem better.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC = 16, AB = 107, then the coordinates can be assigned as follows:

- Point D: (0,0)
- Point C: (16,0) because BC = 16
- Point B: (16,107) because AB = 107
- Point A: (0,107)

Wait, no. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if AB is 107, and BC is 16, then ABCD should be arranged such that AB is vertical or horizontal? Hmm, depends on how we place it.

Wait, perhaps
