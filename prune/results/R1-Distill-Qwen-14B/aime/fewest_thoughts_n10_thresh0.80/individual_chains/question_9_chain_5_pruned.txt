Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. Then, I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.

First, I remember that logarithms can be rewritten using the change of base formula or by converting them into exponential form. Maybe that would help here. Let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think I can simplify both equations by using logarithm properties. Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x). I recall that log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a). So, this can be written as x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, because the exponent is x, so it comes out as a multiplier.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) can be simplified. That would be 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, these look a bit similar. I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other because of the logarithm reciprocal property. That is, log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, if I let log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k.

Let me substitute that into the equations. Let me denote log_x(y) as k. Then, the first equation becomes:

x * k = 10. So, x = 10 / k.

The second equation becomes 4y * (1/k) = 10. So, that's (4y) / k = 10. Then, 4y = 10k, so y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

Now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of k. I can now relate them. Since I know that log_x(y) = k, I can write that in exponential form. Remember that log_x(y) = k implies that x^k = y.

So, substituting the expressions for x and y in terms of k into this equation: x^k = y.

From earlier, x = 10/k and y = (5k)/2. So, substituting into x^k = y:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me take both sides to some power or manipulate the exponents.

Alternatively, maybe taking natural logarithms on both sides would help. Let's do that.

Take the natural log of both sides:

ln[(10/k)^k] = ln[(5k)/2].

Using the logarithm power rule, this becomes:

k * ln(10/k) = ln(5k/2).

Let me expand ln(10/k) as ln(10) - ln(k). So:

k * [ln(10) - ln(k)] = ln(5k/2).

Let's distribute the k:

k * ln(10) - k * ln(k) = ln(5k) - ln(2).

Wait, ln(5k/2) is ln(5k) - ln(2).

So, now the equation is:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5k) - ln(2).

Hmm, this is a bit messy, but maybe I can rearrange terms. Let me bring all terms to one side.

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5k) + ln(2) = 0.

Let me see if I can factor some terms. Let's look at the terms involving k:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5k).

Hmm, I can factor out a k from the first two terms and the third term is -ln(5k). Let me write that:

k [ln(10) - ln(k)] - ln(5k) + ln(2) = 0.

Wait, that's similar to the original expression. Maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write ln(5k) as ln(5) + ln(k). So:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - [ln(5) + ln(k)] + ln(2) = 0.

Expanding that:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0.

Combine like terms:

k ln(10) - (k + 1) ln(k) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation in k, which might not have a straightforward algebraic solution. Maybe I can make a substitution or look for a value of k that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an earlier substitution that's more complicating things. Let me go back and see if there's another way.

Wait, another thought: since x and y are both greater than 1, and we have expressions for x and y in terms of k, perhaps I can find k numerically or see if it's a nice integer.

Let me think about possible integer values for k.

Let me try k=2. Let's see
