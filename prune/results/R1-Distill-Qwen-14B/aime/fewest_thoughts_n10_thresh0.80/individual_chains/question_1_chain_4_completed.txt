Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

So numerator is x y z, denominator is x² y² z². So the entire product is (x y z) / (x² y² z²) = 1/(x y z). 

So left side is 1/(x y z).

Right side: 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute the exponent:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12

1/3 = 4/12

1/4 = 3/12

So sum is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 over 12, so 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12).

Putting it together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies that x y z = 2^(-13/12)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me denote that as equation (4):

x y z = 2^(-13/12)  ...(4)

So the product of x, y, z is 2^(-13/12). Cool.

Now, I have equations (1a), (2a), (3a), and equation (4). I need to find x, y, z.

Alternatively, perhaps take equations (1a), (2a), (3a), and solve for the ratios of x, y, z.

Let me think: from equation (1a): x = 2^(1/2) y z

From equation (2a): y = 2^(1/3) x z

From equation (3a): z = 2^(1/4) x y

So perhaps I can substitute these into each other.

Let me substitute equation (2a) into equation (1a):

x = 2^(1/2) y z

But y = 2^(1/3) x z, so substitute that:

x = 2^(1/2) * [2^(1/3) x z] * z

Simplify:

x = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) * x * z^2

Which is:

x = 2^(5/6) x z²

Divide both sides by x (since x is positive, can't be zero):

1 = 2^(5/6) z²

So z² = 2^(-5/6)

So z = 2^(-5/12) since z is positive.

Alright, so z is known now: z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, let's use equation (3a): z = 2^(1/4) x y

We know z, so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) 

= 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) [since 1/4 is 3/12]

= 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3)

From equation (4): x y z = 2^(-13/12)

We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

x y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-13/12)

But x y is 2^(-2/3) = 2^(-8/12), so:

2^(-8/12) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-13/12), which checks out. Good.

Now, let's get back to equation (2a): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

y = 2^(1/3) * x * 2^(-5/12)

Simplify exponents:

2^(1/3) = 2^(4/12), so:

y = 2^(4/12) * x * 2^(-5/12) = 2^( -1/12 ) x

So y = x * 2^(-1/12)  ...(5)

Similarly, from equation (1a): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12)

Simplify exponents:

2^(1/2) = 2^(6/12), so:

x = 2^(6/12) * y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/12) y

So x = y * 2^(1/12)  ...(6)

Wait, equation (5) is y = x * 2^(-1/12), and equation (6) is x = y * 2^(1/12). These are consistent because if x = y * 2^(1/12), then y = x / 2^(1/12) = x * 2^(-1/12). So that's consistent.

Now, since x y = 2^(-2/3), and from equation (5): y = x * 2^(-1/12), substitute into x y = 2^(-2/3):

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) ) = 2^(-2/3)

Which is x² * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x² = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12) 

Let me compute the exponent: -2/3 is -8/12, plus 1/12 is -7/12

So x² = 2^(-7/12)

Thus x = 2^(-7/24) since x is positive.

Wait, wait: square root of 2^(-7/12) is 2^(-7/24).

Yes, because (2^a)^2 = 2^(2a), so solving for a: 2a = -7/12 => a = -7/24.

So x = 2^(-7/24)

Then, from equation (5): y = x * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12)

Convert 1/12 to 2/24: so 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y = 2^(-3/8)

And z is already known as 2^(-5/12)

So now I have x, y, z expressed in terms of exponents of 2.

Let me note them:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me check if these satisfy all the original equations.

First equation: log₂(x / (y z)) 

Compute x/(y z):

x/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)]

Simplify exponents:

Denominator: (-3/8) + (-5/12) = (-9/24 - 10/24) = (-19/24)

So x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^( (-7 +19)/24 ) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2). So log₂(2^(1/2)) = 1/2. Correct.

Second equation: log₂(y / (x z))

Compute y/(x z):

y/(x z) = [2^(-3/8)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12)]

Simplify denominator exponents:

-7/24 + (-5/12) = -7/24 -10/24 = (-17/24)

So y/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24)

Convert -3/8 to -9/24:

2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^( (-9 + 17)/24 ) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3). So log₂(2^(1/3)) = 1/3. Correct.

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) 

Compute z/(x y):

z/(x y) = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)]

Simplify denominator exponents:

-7/24 + (-3/8) = -7/24 -9/24 = (-16/24) = (-2/3)

So z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-2/3)

Convert -2/3 to -8/12:

2^(-5/12) / 2^(-8/12) = 2^( ( -5 +8 ) /12 ) = 2^(3/12) = 2^(1/4). So log₂(2^(1/4)) = 1/4. Correct.

Great, so all equations are satisfied.

Now, the goal is to compute |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²):

= log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) 

= 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z

We have x, y, z as powers of 2, so log₂x is just the exponent.

log₂x = -7/24

log₂y = -3/8 = -9/24

log₂z = -5/12 = -10/24

So:

4 log₂x = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6

3 log₂y = 3*(-9/24) = (-27)/24 = -9/8

2 log₂z = 2*(-10/24) = (-20)/24 = -5/6

Now, sum them:

-7/6 - 9/8 -5/6

First, find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have LCM 24.

Convert each:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 3.

-75 ÷ 3 = -25; 24 ÷3=8. So -25/8.

But the question is |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|, so absolute value.

| -25/8 | = 25/8

So the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m=25, n=8. So m + n = 33.

Wait, just to double-check all steps, especially the calculations, because I might have made a mistake in the arithmetic.

Let me recheck the sum:

4 log₂x: 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6 ≈ -1.1667

3 log₂y: 3*(-9/24)= (-27)/24 = -9/8 = -1.125

2 log₂z: 2*(-10/24) = (-20)/24 = -5/6 ≈ -0.8333

Sum: -1.1667 -1.125 -0.8333 = approximately -3.125

Which is -25/8, because 25/8=3.125. So yes, correct.

So the absolute value is 25/8. m=25, n=8, so m + n=33.


We are given the system of equations involving logarithms:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Converting each equation to exponential form:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\),
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\),
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\).

Multiplying all three equations together:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}.
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{1}{x y z}.
\]

The right side exponent is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{x y z} = 2^{13/12} \implies x y z = 2^{-13/12}.
\]

Expressing each variable in terms of the others and substituting, we find:

\[
x = 2^{-7/24}, \quad y = 2^{-3/8}, \quad z = 2^{-5/12}.
\]

We need to compute \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
4(-7/24) + 3(-9/24) + 2(-10/24) = -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}.
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}.
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
