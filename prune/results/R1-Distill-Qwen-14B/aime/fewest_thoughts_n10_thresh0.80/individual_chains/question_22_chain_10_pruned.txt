Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon, ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Interesting. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA, right? Since it's equilateral, all the sides are equal in length. Let me denote the side length as 's'. So, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length 's' of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. So, let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's kind of like a regular hexagon but maybe not regular because the triangle formed by extending those sides has sides of different lengths. So, it's an irregular convex hexagon but equilateral.

I remember that in such hexagons, each pair of opposite sides is both equal and parallel. So, maybe this hexagon can be thought of as being formed by translating each side over to create the next side. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. Similarly, if I extend BC, DE, and FA, would they form another triangle? Probably, but the problem gives the side lengths of the first triangle as 200, 240, and 300. So, let me focus on that.

I think I can model this hexagon as being inside a larger triangle, where each side of the hexagon is a segment that's parallel to the sides of this larger triangle. So, the sides of the hexagon are like smaller, equal-length segments cutting the sides of the larger triangle.

Wait, so maybe the hexagon is similar to the triangle? Or is it similar to another triangle inside? Hmm.

Alternatively, I recall that in such cases, the hexagon can be considered as a "truncated" triangle, where each corner is cut off by a line segment. But in this case, since it's equilateral and all opposite sides are parallel, perhaps the truncation is done in such a way that each side is cut proportionally.

Wait, maybe it's better to model
