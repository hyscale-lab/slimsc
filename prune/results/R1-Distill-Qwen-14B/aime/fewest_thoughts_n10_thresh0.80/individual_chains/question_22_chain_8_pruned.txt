Alright, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon, ABCDEF. All the opposite sides are parallel, which probably means it's something like a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all sides equal except in the equilateral part. Wait, the problem says it's equilateral, so all sides are equal in length. But it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal.

The problem mentions that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, I should visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel. Since it's equilateral, each side is the same length, say 's'.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Hmm, that's interesting. So, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I'm trying to figure out how this relates to the side length 's' of the hexagon.

I remember that in such a hexagon, the extensions of the sides will form a triangle similar to the original hexagon's structure. Maybe the sides of this triangle are proportional to the sides of the hexagon in some way.

Wait, maybe I should think about the concept of similar triangles or affine transformations. Since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, it's a centrally symmetric hexagon, right? So it's similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in some directions.

Another thought: in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the sides can be thought of as vectors. So, each pair of opposite sides are equal vectors. So, AB = ED, BC = FE, CD = AF, but in the opposite direction.

If I model the hexagon as a closed polygon, the sum of all the vectors should be zero. So, AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 0. Since opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, this simplifies to AB + BC + CD - AB - BC - CD = 0, which checks out.

But how does this help? Maybe I should think about the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, these lines will intersect at three points forming a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300.

I think I need to relate the side lengths of this triangle to the side length 's' of the hexagon. Maybe using similar triangles or some proportionality.

Wait, another approach: in such a hexagon, the sides can be thought of as part of a larger triangle. The triangle formed by the extensions is larger, and the hexagon is inscribed within it. Perhaps each side of the hexagon corresponds to a segment on the sides of the triangle.

Wait, maybe it's similar to how a regular hexagon can be inscribed in a triangle with each side divided into equal parts. But since this hexagon is equilateral but not necessarily regular, the way it's inscribed is different.

I think I should consider the ratios of the sides. The triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. So, maybe the hexagon's side is a portion of these. Let me see if I can find a ratio or something.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon and try to express the triangle in terms of that.

Let me consider the triangle as the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it, touching each side. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each side of the hexagon will be tangent to the sides of the triangle in some way.

Wait, maybe similar to the concept of a triangle with
