Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward—it's the sum of the three variables. The second equation looks more complex. Let me see if I can simplify it or factor it somehow.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one of which is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let me try to group the terms differently.

Wait a minute, I can factor out a from the first two terms: a²(b + c). Similarly, from the next two terms, I can factor out b²: b²(a + c). And from the last two terms, I can factor out c²: c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me try that.

So substituting, the expression becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

Wait, that's interesting. So the second equation simplifies to:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this. Maybe I can write this as a function of each variable. Let me define a function f(x) = x²(300 - x). Then the equation becomes f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

So, f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000, and a + b + c = 300. Now, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, I might need to find all triples where the sum of their individual f(x) values equals 6,000,000.

But this still seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can find a relationship between a, b, and c. Let me consider the case where two of the variables are zero. For example, if b = 0 and c = 0, then a = 300. Let's see what the second equation gives in that case.

If a=300, b=0, c=0, then f(a)=300²*(300 - 300)=0, and f(b)=0, f(c)=0. So the sum is 0, which is way less than 6,000,000. So that doesn't work. So maybe all of a, b, c can't be too small.

Wait, perhaps the variables have to be such that each of them contributes a significant amount to the total 6,000,000. Let me think about the function f(x) = x²(300 - x). Let me analyze this function.

Since x is nonnegative, and up to 300 because a + b + c = 300,
