Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's being asked. Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the coffee shop time.

Alright, let me break this down. I think the problem is setting up two equations based on the information given. The first scenario says when she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. The second scenario is when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, also including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, so the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. So, from both scenarios, I can set up equations where the walking time plus the coffee time equals the total time given.

Let me write this out. 

In the first case:
Walking speed = s km/h
Total time = 4 hours = 4*60 = 240 minutes
Coffee shop time = t minutes
So, the time she actually spends walking is (240 - t) minutes. But wait, her speed is in km per hour, so I should probably convert everything into hours to make it consistent.

Wait, maybe I should stick with hours instead of minutes. Let me think.

The total time in the first case is 4 hours, which includes walking and t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. Hmm, but t is in minutes, so I might need to convert that.

Wait, let me convert t into hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours. So, the walking time in the first case is 4 - (t/60) hours.

Similarly, the distance she walks is 9 km. So, using the formula distance = speed × time, we have:

9 = s × (4 - t/60)

That's equation one.

In the second scenario:
Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time = 2 hours and 2
