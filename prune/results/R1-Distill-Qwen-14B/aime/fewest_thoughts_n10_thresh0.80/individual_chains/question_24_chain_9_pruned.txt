Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The list of positive integers has three properties:
1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them all up, it should equal 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number in the list. Also, it's unique, meaning no other number can have the same frequency as 9.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is an integer, and it's not present in the list. So the list must have an even number of elements because if it were odd, the median would be one of the elements, right? Because for an odd-length list, the median is the exact middle number, which is part of the list.

Wait, no. Wait, if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So if those two middle numbers are different, their average might not be an integer. But in this case, the median is a positive integer, so the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer, meaning the two middle numbers must be both even or both odd, so their sum is even, and thus the average is an integer. Also, importantly, this median integer does not appear in the list. So the two middle numbers can't be the same as the median, otherwise, the median would be in the list.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the list has even length, say 2n elements. The median would be the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements. If the two middle numbers are both equal to the same integer, then the median would be that integer. But in this case, the median is not in the list. So that means the two middle numbers must not be equal to each other, because if they were, the median would be that number, which would be in the list. So the two middle numbers must be different, and their average is an integer. So, for example, if the middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer and not in the list.

Wait, but if the list is such that the two middle numbers add up to an even number, but they are different. So their average is an integer, and that integer is the median. But that median is not present anywhere else in the list.

So, putting it all together, the list must be arranged such that the two middle numbers add up to twice the median, which is an integer, but that median isn't present in the list.

Alright, so let's start structuring the problem.

First, let's consider the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So how many times does 9 appear? Let's thinkâ€”since it's the mode, it's the most frequent. Let's denote the number of 9s as k. Then, all other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

Also, the sum of all numbers is 30. So, if I have m numbers in the list, the sum is 30.

Now, I need to find the configuration that meets all these conditions. Let me think about possible lengths of the list.

Let me consider possible lengths. The median is a positive integer, and it's not in the list. So the list must have an even number of elements because, for an odd-length list, the median would be an element in the list, which can't be the case here. So, the number of elements must be even. Let's denote the number of elements as 2n. So n is a positive integer.

So, the list has 2n elements. The median is (a_n + a_{n+1}) / 2, which is an integer not in the list.

Also, the unique mode is 9, which is appearing more times than any other number.

So let's think about the minimal case where the list has the least number of elements. Let me try small n first.

Wait, but the sum is 30, and the numbers are positive integers. So the minimal number of elements is when the numbers are as large as possible. The maximum possible number is 30 (if the list has only one element). But with multiple elements, it's smaller.

Wait, but for our problem, let's consider possible lengths. Since the list is even in length, let's try 4 elements. Let's see if that's possible.

Wait, 4 elements: the two middle numbers are the 2nd and 3rd elements. The median is their average. Let's see:

Suppose the list is [a, b, c, d], ordered. The median is (b + c)/2, which must be an integer not present in the list.

Also, the mode is 9, which must appear more than any other number. So in a list of 4 elements, 9 could appear twice, and others appear once each. But wait, is that the minimum? Let's see.

If I have
