Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for primes, certain conditions must hold for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². I think I should start by checking small primes and see if any of them satisfy this condition. Maybe I'll begin with p=2, then p=3, 5, 7, etc., until I find the smallest one that works.

Let me start with p=2. If p=2, then n⁴ + 1 must be divisible by 4. Let's test n=1: 1⁴ +1 = 2, which is 2 mod 4, not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4 again. Wait, maybe n=0? But n has to be positive. Hmm, seems like for p=2, n⁴ +1 is never divisible by 4. So p=2 isn't suitable.

Next, p=3. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 because modulo 9 cycles every 9 numbers.

n=1: 1⁴=1 => 1 mod9
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: 256 mod9. Let's see, 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9.
n=5: 625 mod9. 625 /9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod9.
n=6: 6⁴=1296, which is 0 mod9.
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod9.
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, 1+9=10, 1+0=1. So 1 mod9.

Looking for n⁴ ≡8 mod9 (since -1 mod9 is 8). From the above, n=2 gives 7 mod9, n=7 gives 7 mod9 as well. No n makes n⁴ ≡8 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Moving on to p=5. Let's compute n⁴ mod25 and see if any n satisfies n⁴ ≡24 mod25 (since -1 mod25 is 24). Let's try n from 1 to 24, but maybe I can find a pattern.

First, note that for modulo 25, Euler's theorem says that n^φ(25)=n^20≡1 mod25 if n and 25 are coprime. So n^4 cycles every 5 exponents (since 20/4=5). Let's see.

n=1: 1 mod25
n=2: 16 mod25
n=3: 81 mod25=6
n=4: 256 mod25=6 (since 25*10=250, 256-250=6)
n=5: 0 mod25
n=6: 6⁴=1296. 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21. So 21 mod25.
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401-25*96=2401-2400=1. So 1 mod25.
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 - 25*163=4096-4075=21. So 21 mod25.
n=9: 9⁴=6561. 6561 divided by 25: 25*262=6550, 6561-6550=11. So 11 mod25.
n=10: 0 mod25
n=11: 11⁴=14641. 14641 -25*585=14641-14625=16. So 16 mod25.
n=12: 12⁴=20736. 20736 -25*829=20736 - 20725=11. 11 mod25.
n=13: 13⁴=28561. 28561-25*1142=28561-28550=11. So 11 mod25.
Wait, maybe I made a mistake. 13 squared is 169, then 13^4 is (169)^2. 169 mod25 is 19, so 19^2=361 mod25. 361-25*14=361-350=11. So yes, 11 mod25.

n=14: 14⁴=(14²)^2=196². 196 mod25=21, so 21²=441 mod25. 441-25*17=441-425=16. So 16 mod25.
n=15: 0 mod25
n=16: 16⁴=65536. 65536 mod25. Well, 16 mod25=16, 16²=256 mod25=6, 6²=36 mod25=11. So 11 mod25.
n=17: 17⁴. 17 mod25=17. 17²=289 mod25=14, 14²=196 mod25=21. So 21 mod25.
n=18: 18⁴. 18 mod25=18. 18²=324 mod25=24, 24²=576 mod25=1. So 1 mod25.
n=19: 19 mod25=19. 19²=361 mod25=11, 11²=121 mod25=21. So 21 mod25.
n=20: 0 mod25
n=21: 21⁴. 21 mod25=21. 21²=441 mod25=16, 16²=256 mod25=6. So 6 mod25.
n=22: 22 mod25=22. 22²=484 mod25=9, 9²=81 mod25=6. So 6 mod25.
n=23: 23 mod25=23. 23²=529 mod25=4, 4²=16 mod25=16. So 16 mod25.
n=24: 24 mod25=24. 24²=576 mod25=1, 1²=1 mod25=1. So 1 mod25.

Wait, looking through all these, I don't see any n where n⁴ ≡24 mod25. Hmm, maybe p=5 doesn't work either. But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check.

Wait, when n=7, n⁴=7⁴=2401 mod25=1. So that's 1 mod25. What about n=18: 18⁴=104976. 104976 mod25: 104976 divided by 25 is 4199.04, so 4199*25=104975. 104976-104975=1. So 1 mod25.

Wait a second, maybe p=5 isn't the prime we're looking for. Let's try p=13? Wait, no, maybe I should check p=5 more carefully. Wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation.

Wait, let's try n=2: 2⁴=16 mod25=16. Not 24. n=3: 81 mod25=6. n=4: 256 mod25=6. n=7: 1 mod25. Hmm, maybe n= sqrt(-1) mod25? Wait, but is -1 a quartic residue mod25?

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider the equation n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². For this to have a solution, certain conditions must be met. I remember that for primes p, n² ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution if and only if p ≡ 1 mod4. So maybe for n^4 ≡ -1, p must be 1 mod8? Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the multiplicative order. If n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p^2. So the order of n modulo p^2 divides 8. But also, since n^4 ≡ -1, the order can't be 4 because then n^4 would be 1. So the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 must divide φ(p²) if such an n exists.

φ(p²) = p² - p = p(p-1). So 8 divides p(p-1). For primes p>2, p is odd, so p-1 must be even, which it is. So 8 divides p(p-1) when either p ≡1 mod8 or p=2. Wait, but p=2 didn't work earlier. So maybe the smallest prime p ≡1 mod8 is p=17? Wait, but 17 is larger than 5. Wait, let me check. Let me check p=13 or p=17, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check p=17. But wait, before that, maybe I should check p=5 again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations earlier. Maybe n= 2^4 mod25 is 16, which is not 24. n=3: 81 mod25=6. n=4: 256 mod25=6. n=5: 0. n=6: 1296 mod25. 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21. So 21. Hmm.

Wait, maybe p=5 doesn't work, so let's try p=13. Let me compute n⁴ mod169 for p=13. Wait, 13²=169. So I'm looking for n where n⁴ ≡-1 mod169, which is 168 mod169.

This could take a while. Maybe instead of checking each n, I can find a pattern or use some properties. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2 implies that n^8 ≡1 mod p^2. So the multiplicative order of n mod p² is 8, which means that 8 divides φ(p²) which is p(p-1). So p must satisfy that 8 divides p(p-1).

So for p>2, since p is odd, p-1 must be divisible by 8. So p ≡1 mod8. So the smallest primes that are 1 mod8 are 17, 41, 73, etc. Wait, but 17 is the first after 2. Wait, but maybe I'm wrong because 5 is 1 mod4 but not 1 mod8. Hmm.

Wait, could there be a prime p=5 where n^4 ≡-1 mod25? Because 5 is 1 mod4.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about using Hensel's lemma or lifting solutions from mod p to mod p².

So, first, for p=5, let's check if n^4 ≡-1 mod5 has a solution. Let's compute n^4 mod5.

n=1:1 mod5
n=2:16 mod5=1
n=3:81 mod5=1
n=4:256 mod5=1
n=0:0.

Wait, so for p=5, n^4 mod5 is 0,1. So -1 mod5 is 4, but n^4 mod5 is either 0 or 1. So no solution exists for n^4 ≡-1 mod5. Therefore, p=5 cannot be the prime because even mod5, there's no solution. So p cannot be 5.

Hmm, that's interesting. So p must be a prime where -1 is a quartic residue mod p. So for that to happen, -1 must be a fourth power in the multiplicative group mod p. The multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So for -1 to be a fourth power, the order of -1 in the multiplicative group must divide (p-1)/4. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the multiplicative group mod p, the element -1 has order 2. For -1 to be a fourth power, the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution. So the multiplicative group must have an element of order 8, because (x^4)^2 ≡1, so x^8≡1. So the multiplicative group must have an element of order 8, which implies that 8 divides p-1, so p ≡1 mod8.

Wait, this makes sense. So the primes p where n^4 ≡-1 mod p has a solution must satisfy p≡1 mod8. So the smallest such primes are 17, 41, 73, etc. So the smallest prime p where such a solution exists is p=17.

Wait, but earlier I thought p=5 didn't work, and p=13 isn't 1 mod8. Let me check p=17. So p=17 is 1 mod8, so it's a candidate.

Now, let's check if p=17 is indeed the least prime where there's an n with n^4 ≡-1 mod17²=289.

Wait, but before that, let me check p=13, which is 5 mod8. So perhaps p=13 doesn't work, but maybe p=17 is the next possibility.

But before moving on, maybe I should check if p=2 is possible, but earlier I saw that it's not, because n^4 +1 is 2 mod4, which isn't divisible by 4.

Wait, so maybe p=17 is the least prime. So now, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

So first, let's check if there's an n with n^4 ≡-1 mod17. Then, using Hensel's lemma, we can lift that solution to mod17²=289.

So let's find n where n^4 ≡-1 mod17. Let's compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 8 (since it's symmetric beyond that).

n=1: 1 mod17
n=2: 16 mod17
n=3: 81 mod17. 17*4=68, 81-68=13. So 13.
n=4: 256 mod17. 17*15=255, 256-255=1. So 1.
n=5: 625 mod17. Let's compute 17*36=612, 625-612=13. So 13 mod17.
n=6: 6^4=1296 mod17. Let's compute 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4. So 4 mod17.
n=7: 7^4=2401 mod17. Let's compute 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4. So 4 mod17.
n=8: 8^4=4096 mod17. Let's see, 17*241=4097, so 4096 is -1 mod17. Oh, so n=8: 8^4=4096≡-1 mod17.

Great! So n=8 mod17 is a solution to n^4 ≡-1 mod17. Now, we can try to lift this solution to modulo 17²=289 using Hensel's lemma.

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡0 mod p^k and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there's a unique lift to mod p^{k+1}.

Here, f(n)=n^4 +1. We have f(8) ≡0 mod17, since 8^4 ≡-1 mod17. Now, compute f'(n)=4n^3. At n=8, f'(8)=4*(8)^3.

Compute 8^3=512. 512 mod17: 17*30=510, 512-510=2. So f'(8) =4*2=8 mod17. 8 is not 0 mod17, so Hensel's applies. Thus, there's a unique lift of 8 mod17 to mod289.

So let me find m =8 +17t, where t is an integer between 0 and 16, such that m^4 ≡-1 mod289.

So m =8 +17t. Let's compute m^4 +1 mod289.

First, expand (8 +17t)^4 using binomial theorem.

(8 +17t)^4 =8^4 +4*8^3*(17t) +6*8^2*(17t)^2 +4*8*(17t)^3 + (17t)^4.

Compute each term mod289. Since 17²=289, terms with (17t)^k where k>=2 will be 0 mod289. So we can ignore the last three terms. So:

(8 +17t)^4 ≈8^4 +4*8^3*(17t) mod289.

Compute 8^4=4096. 4096 mod289: 289*14=4046. 4096-4046=50. So 8^4≡50 mod289.

Next term:4*8^3*(17t). 8^3=512. 512 mod289: 289*1=289, 512-289=223. So 8^3≡223 mod289.

So 4*223=892. 892 mod289: 289*3=867. 892-867=25. So 4*8^3≡25 mod289.

Multiply by 17t: 25*17t=425t. 425 mod289: 289*1=289, 425-289=136. So 425t≡136t mod289.

So the expansion is 50 +136t mod289.

We want this to be ≡-1 mod289. So 50 +136t ≡288 mod289.

So 136t ≡238 mod289. (Because 288-50=238.)

Now, solve for t: 136t ≡238 mod289.

First, let's compute the GCD of 136 and289. 289 ÷136=2 with remainder 17 (136*2=272, 289-272=17).

Then, 136 ÷17=8 with remainder 0. So GCD is 17. Since 17 divides 238 (238 ÷17=14), there are solutions.

Let me compute 136t ≡238 mod289.

Divide both sides by17: 136/17=8, 238/17=14, 289/17=17.

So 8t ≡14 mod17.

Solve 8t ≡14 mod17.

Find the inverse of 8 mod17. 8*x ≡1 mod17.

Try x=15: 8*15=120 mod17. 17*7=119, 120-119=1. So inverse is15.

So t≡14*15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, 210-204=6. So t≡6 mod17.

So t=6 +17k, but since t is between0 and16 (as we're working mod17), t=6.

So m=8 +17*6=8+102=110.

Wait, let me check if m=110 indeed satisfies m^4 +1 ≡0 mod289.

Compute 110^4 +1 mod289.

Alternatively, since 110 ≡8 mod17, and we've done the lifting, it should work. But let me compute it to be sure.

Compute 110^4 mod289.

But 110 mod289=110.

110^2=12100. 12100 mod289: Let's find how many times 289 fits into 12100.

289*41=289*40=11560 +289=11849. 12100-11849=251. So 12100 ≡251 mod289.

Then, 251^2=63001. Now, 63001 mod289: Let's compute 289*217=?

Well, 289*200=57800, 289*17=4913. So 57800+4913=62713. 63001-62713=288. So 251² ≡288 mod289.

So 110^4 ≡288 mod289. Thus, 110^4 +1 ≡289≡0 mod289. Perfect.

So m=110 is the least positive integer where m^4 +1 is divisible by17²=289.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there a smaller m?

Because when I solved for t, I found t=6 mod17, but t ranges from0 to16, so the smallest t is6. So m=8+17*6=110.

But maybe there's a smaller m. Because sometimes when you lift solutions, there might be multiple solutions, but Hensel's lemma says the lift is unique in this case because the derivative is non-zero mod p. So 110 is the smallest positive solution.

Wait, but let me check m=110 is indeed the smallest. Let me check m=8: 8^4=4096, 4096+1=4097. 4097 divided by289 is 14.16, which isn't integer. 289*14=4046, 4097-4046=51. So 4097≡51 mod289.

m=25: Let me compute 25^4+1. 25²=625, 625²=390625. 390625 +1=390626. Now, 390626 ÷289: 289
