Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that ties into this product.

Looking at the product, each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern. Let me denote z = ω^k for simplicity. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z². Let me factor this quadratic:

2 - 2z + z² = z² - 2z + 2.

Hmm, does this quadratic factor? Let me compute its discriminant: D = (−2)^2 − 4(1)(2) = 4 − 8 = -4. So the roots are complex, which makes sense because ω is a root of unity on the unit circle.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate this quadratic to some polynomial whose roots are ω^k. Since ω is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is Φ₁₃(x), which is the cyclotomic polynomial as I mentioned earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can relate the product over k of (z² - 2z + 2) as z runs through all 13th roots of unity except 1. Because when k=0, ω^0 =1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 +1 = 2 - 2 +1 =1. Hmm, so maybe the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, but when k=0, the term is 1. So the entire product is the product over all z=ω^k (k=0,...,12) of (z² - 2z + 2).

But wait, the problem specifies the product from k=0 to 12, which includes all 13th roots, including 1. So that's consistent with my thought.

So, the product is the product over all roots z of x¹³ -1 =0 of (z² - 2z + 2). Because x¹³ -1 factors into (x -1)(x¹² +x¹¹ + ... + x +1), and the roots are 1, ω, ω², ..., ω¹².

So, the product is the product over all roots z of x¹³ -1 of (z² - 2z + 2). Which is the same as evaluating the resultant or something
