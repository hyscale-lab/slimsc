Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where we have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus has two diagonals that bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, hold on. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's correct. So, for a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

So, in this case, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That means that points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, same with B and D. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

So, all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, substituting each point into the hyperbola equation:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

For point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

And similarly for points C and D, which would give the same equations because they are just negatives of A and B.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are equal.

But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, perhaps it's easier to work with vectors or coordinates.

Let me think about the coordinates. Let me denote:

A = (x1, y1)

B = (x2, y2)

C = (-x1, -y1)

D = (-x2, -y2)

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint.

Now, since it's a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, etc., are all equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.

So, let's calculate the distance between A and B. Using the distance formula:

AB² = (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²

Similarly, BC² = ( -x1 - x2 )² + ( -y1 - y2 )²

Since AB² = BC², we have:

(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)² = (-x1 - x2)² + (-y1 - y2)²

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²
= x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1²

Right side: (-x1 - x2)² + (-y1 - y2)²
= (x1 + x2)² + (y1 + y2)²
= x1² + 2x1x2 + x2² + y1² + 2y1y2 + y2²

Setting left and right equal:

x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1² = x1² + 2x1x2 + x2² + y1² + 2y1y2 + y2²

Simplify both sides by subtracting x1², x2², y1², y2²:

-2x1x2 - 2y1y2 = 2x1x2 + 2y1y2

Bring all terms to one side:

-2x1x2 - 2y1y2 - 2x1x2 - 2y1y2 = 0

Combine like terms:

-4x1x2 - 4y1y2 = 0

Divide both sides by -4:

x1x2 + y1y2 = 0

Hmm, okay, so that's one condition. So, the product of the coordinates of A and B must satisfy x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

But wait, another condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, points A and B must satisfy:

x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1

x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1

So, now we have these three equations:

1. x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1
2. x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1
3. x1x2 + y1y2 = 0

We need to find BD². Let me figure out which points B and D are. Since D is (-x2, -y
