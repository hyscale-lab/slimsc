Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the plane of the circle but doesn't intersect it. The problem says the radius of the original circle is 3, and the distance from the center of that circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus has a big radius R = 6 and a small radius r = 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. So, when the torus rests inside the sphere, they are internally tangent along a circle, and when it's outside, they're externally tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference, which will be a fraction m/n. Finally, I have to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm. Let me start by understanding the geometry of the situation. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus touches the sphere at some circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is smaller, so the torus touches along another circle.

Wait, no. Wait, S has radius 11. When T is inside S, T is entirely inside S, and they are tangent along a circle. When T is outside S, T must be enclosing S, so S is inside T, and they are tangent along another circle. Hmm, is that right? Or maybe when T is resting on the outside of S, does it mean T is outside S and just touching it? I think that's correct.

So, in both cases, the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle. The radius of that circle from the center of the sphere will be different in each case.

I need to find r_i and r_o, which are the radii of these circles of tangency as measured from the center of the sphere S.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first.

Internal Tangency:

The sphere S has radius 11. The torus T has a tube radius of 3 and a center distance of 6 from the axis, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus is 6. Wait, no, maybe that's not the right way to think about it.

Perhaps I should model the torus as a surface of revolution. The torus can be represented parametrically, but maybe I can find the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface at the point of tangency.

Wait, let's consider the cross-section. When the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency will be where the sphere just touches the outermost part of the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere will touch the innermost part of the torus.

Wait, maybe that's not exactly correct. Let me think again.

The sphere S is of radius 11. The torus T is inside S when resting on the inside, so the torus must be entirely inside S, touching it at a single circle. Similarly, when T is outside, S is entirely inside T, and they touch at a single circle.

So, for the internal case, the maximum distance from the center of S to any point on T is 11. For the external case, the minimum distance from the center of S to any point on T is 11.

Wait, but the center of the torus's generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the axis. Hmm, maybe I should model this with coordinates.

Let me set up a coordinate system where the center of the sphere S is at the origin (0,0,0). The torus T is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of that circle. Let's assume the axis is along the z-axis for simplicity. So, the generating circle lies in the plane z
