Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions like this, it's often helpful to represent z in polar form. Since the magnitude of z is 4, I can write z as 4 times e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can express it as z = 4 cosθ + 4i sinθ. That might make it easier to handle.

So, let me write z as 4 e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4) e^{-iθ}, since the reciprocal of a complex number in polar form is just the reciprocal of the magnitude and the negative of the angle. So, 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Now, substituting these into the expression, I get:

(75 + 117i) * 4 e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4 e^{iθ}.

Let me compute (75 + 117i) * 4 first.

75 * 4 = 300.

117i * 4 = 468i.

So, the first term becomes (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Compute (96 + 144i) * (1/4):

96/4 = 24.

144i /4 = 36i.

So, the second term becomes (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

So, putting it all together, the expression is:

(300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, since e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ} are complex exponentials, I can express this as a sum. But perhaps it's better to expand these using Euler's formula.

Euler's formula says e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let me expand both terms.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Multiply this out:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

But i^2 = -1, so that last term becomes -468 sinθ.

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiply this out:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 is -1, so the last term becomes +36 sinθ.

Now, let's combine all these terms.

First, the first term expanded:

300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

Similarly, the second term:

24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

So, combining the real parts and the imaginary parts:

Real parts:

300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i.

Simplify the real parts:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

That's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

[300 sinθ + 468 cosθ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ] i.

Combine like terms:

(300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ.

That's 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So, the expression becomes:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i.

But the problem asks for the real part of this expression. So, I just need the real part, which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. I need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

That's a function of θ. Let me denote this as R(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

To find the maximum value of R(θ), I can recall that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be written as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), and φ is some angle. The maximum value of this is then C, since the maximum of cosine is 1.

Wait, but in this case, R(θ) is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is similar to a cosθ + b sinθ, but with a negative sign. So, to find the maximum, I can treat it similarly.

Let me compute C = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let's compute that.

324 * 324: Let's break it down. 300^2 = 90000. 24^2 = 576. Then, 2*300*24 = 14400. So, (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute that. 400^2 = 160000, 32^2 = 1024, and 2*400*32=25600. So, (400+32)^2=400^2 +2*400*32 +32^2=160000 +25600 +1024=160000+25600=185600 +1024=186,624.

So, 324^2 is 104,976, and (-432)^2 is 432^2=186,624.

So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What is sqrt(291,600)? Let me see. 500^2 is 250,000. 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250k, 40^2=1600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, 540^2= (500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So, C=540.

Therefore, R(θ) can be written as 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of R(θ) is then 540, since the maximum of cosine is 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm. Because in the standard form, a cosθ + b sinθ is equal to C cos(θ - φ), where C = sqrt(a² + b²), and φ = arctan(b/a) or something like that. But in our case, R(θ)=324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which is like a cosθ + b sinθ with a=324, b=-432. So, C is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(
