Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges have these specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). The question is about finding the distance from a special point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This distance is equal for all faces, and I need to express it in a particular form and then find the sum m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius.

So, the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron is related to its volume and its surface area. I think the formula is something like inradius = 3 * volume / surface area. Let me check that. Yeah, for a tetrahedron, the volume is (1/3) * base area * height, so if I have the volume and the total surface area, the inradius should be 3 times volume divided by the total surface area. That makes sense because the inradius times the surface area would give me the volume scaled by 3, which accounts for the three dimensions.

So, first, I need to find the volume of this tetrahedron. Then, I need to find the areas of each of its four faces and sum them up for the surface area. Once I have those two numbers, I can compute the inradius.

But wait, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edge lengths? I think it's possible using something called the Cayley-Menger determinant. I vaguely remember that formula. Let me try to recall.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by a determinant of a matrix. The formula is:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The matrix for the Cayley-Menger determinant for four points in 3D space is a 5x5 matrix. Let me write it down.

The matrix is:

0   1    1    1    1
1   0   AB² AC² AD²
1  AB²  0   BC² BD²
1  AC² BC²  0   CD²
1  AD² BD² CD²  0

So, plugging in the given lengths. Let me assign the edges:

AB = sqrt(41) => AB² = 41
AC = sqrt(80) => AC² = 80
AD = sqrt(89) => AD² = 89
BC = sqrt(89) => BC² = 89
BD = sqrt(80) => BD² = 80
CD = sqrt(41) => CD² = 41

So, the matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me double-check the placement. The first row is 0,1,1,1,1. Then each subsequent row starts with 1, followed by the squared distances from that point to the others.

So, row 1 corresponds to point A, so AB², AC², AD² are the distances from A to B, C, D.

Similarly, row 2 is point B, distances BA², BC², BD².

Row 3 is point C, CA², CB², CD².

Row 4 is point D, DA², DB², DC².

So, yes, that seems correct.

Now, let's compute the determinant of this matrix. That's going to be a bit involved, but let's see.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:

| 0 1 1 1 1 |
| 1 0 41 80 89|
| 1 41 0 89 80|
| 1 80 89 0 41|
| 1 89 80 41 0 |

Calculating the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is going to be tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry here that can help simplify the computation.

Looking at the matrix, I notice that it's symmetric except for the order of some elements. Let me see if it's a persymmetric matrix or has some other symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a circulant matrix or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, meaning all edges are symmetric? But in this case, the edges come in pairs: AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the edges AB and CD are equal, edges AC and BD are equal, edges AD and BC are equal. So, this suggests that the tetrahedron is "edge-transitive" but not necessarily regular. It's called a disphenoid.

Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, in this case, ABCD is a disphenoid.

I remember that in a disphenoid, there are some properties that can help in computing the volume and other things more easily.

For a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

Volume = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c²) )) / (6 * sqrt(2))

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up some formulas. Maybe it's better to stick with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Alternatively, I recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can also be expressed using the edge lengths. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: since it's a disphenoid, perhaps it can be embedded in a coordinate system in a
