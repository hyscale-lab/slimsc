Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make Bob the winner, assuming he plays optimally.

Hmm, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing. A winning position means the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, Alice starts, and Bob is the second player. We need to find the values of n where Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves. That implies that for those n, Alice is in a losing position.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe I can create a table for small n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's start with n=0. Well, if there are no tokens, the game is already over. So the player who is supposed to move loses. But in our problem, the person who takes the last token wins, so n=0 would mean the previous player took the last token and won. So n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take the last one and win. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from n=2, she leaves 1 for Bob, and Bob can take 1 and win. So Alice would prefer not to do that. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So she can only take 1, but that leads to her losing. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. When n=2, it's Alice's turn. She can only take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take that 1 and win. So Alice has no good move; she can't force a win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which is a winning position for Bob.

Wait, but in game terms, the positions are from the perspective of the current player. So n=2: current player can only take 1, leading to n=1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player. Wait, so if n=2 is a losing position, then if Alice is faced with n=2, she loses. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, maybe I should rephrase: a position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent.

Let me try to make a table for n from
