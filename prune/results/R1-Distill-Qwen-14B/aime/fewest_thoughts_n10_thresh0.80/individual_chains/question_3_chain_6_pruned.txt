Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and make sure I understand each part before moving on.

The problem is about a lottery that Jen is entering. She picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen ones.

The question is asking for the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. They tell us this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so we need to compute a conditional probability. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event that Jen wins the grand prize, and B is the event that she wins a prize.

But wait, in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must also have won a prize because getting all four numbers correct means she certainly has at least two correct. So, event A is a subset of event B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the conditional probability simplifies to P(A) / P(B).

So, our goal is to compute P(A) and P(B), then divide them.

Let me first calculate P(A). This is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the randomly chosen four numbers.

The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10,4). So, the total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for A is just 1, because only one specific combination of four numbers would match Jen's numbers. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

What is C(10,4)? Let me calculate that. C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, onto P(B). P(B) is the probability that Jen wins a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, this can happen in a few different ways: exactly 2 correct, exactly 3 correct, or exactly 4 correct. Wait, but exactly 4 correct is the grand prize, which is event A.

So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of having exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 correct numbers. So, P(B) = P(2 correct) + P(3 correct) + P(4 correct).

We already know P(4 correct) is P(A) = 1/210. So, we need to compute P(2 correct) and P(3 correct).

Let me recall how to compute such probabilities. In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k correct numbers from Jen's 4 and the remaining (4 - k) from the other 6 numbers not chosen by Jen.

Wait, actually, the total set S has 10 numbers. Jen picks 4, so the remaining 6 numbers are the ones she didn't pick. So, when the lottery draws 4 numbers, the number of correct numbers Jen has can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But in this case, we are considering the cases where it's 2, 3, or 4 correct.

So, the number of ways to have exactly k correct numbers is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k
