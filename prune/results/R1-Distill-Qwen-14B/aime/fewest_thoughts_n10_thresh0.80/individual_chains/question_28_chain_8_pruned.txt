Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in such a way that AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. Each pair of opposite edges are equal. Interesting. So, AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. 

The question is about finding the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its four faces. This point I is the incenter, I think, because it's equidistant from all the faces. In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point where the four bisectors meet, and it's equidistant to each face. That distance is called the inradius. 

The answer needs to be in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.

First, I need to figure out how to find the inradius of a tetrahedron. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius r is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume, and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.

But wait, how do I find the volume given these edge lengths? Hmm. Maybe I can use coordinates. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices ABCD, then I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.

But setting up coordinates for a tetrahedron can be tricky. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral or something. Or perhaps it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of its edge lengths. There's a formula called the Cayley-Menger determinant that allows you to compute the volume given all the edge lengths.

Wait, that's right! The Cayley-Menger determinant is a way to compute the volume of a tetrahedron when all six edge lengths are known. The formula is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is given by the determinant of a 5x5 matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC²  0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD²  0  |

So, I can plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant and compute it. Then, take the square root of the absolute value divided by 288 to get the volume.

Let me write down the edge lengths:

AB = √41 ⇒ AB² = 41

AC = √80 ⇒ AC² = 80

AD = √89 ⇒ AD² = 89

BC = √89 ⇒ BC² = 89

BD = √80 ⇒ BD² = 80

CD = √41 ⇒ CD² = 41

So, the matrix for the Cayley-Menger determinant is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me make sure I have this right. Each row corresponds to a point, with the first row being for point A, the second for B, etc. The diagonal elements (excluding the first element) should be the squared distances between points.

Wait, actually, the Cayley-Menger matrix is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and column are all 1s except for the (0,0) entry which is 0, and the other entries are the squares of the distances between the points.

Wait, actually, no. Let me double-check the structure:

The Cayley-Menger matrix for n points in (n-1)-dimensional space is a (n+2)x(n+2) matrix. For a tetrahedron (n=4), it's a 6x6 matrix? Wait, no, I think for 3D space, it's a 5x5 matrix.

Wait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me look up the Cayley-Menger determinant structure. Oh, right, for four points in 3D space, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is:

The Cayley-Menger determinant is a determinant of a (d+2)x(d+2) matrix, where d is the dimension of the space. For 3D, it's 5x5. So for four points in 3D, the determinant is 5x5.

The matrix is constructed as follows:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD²

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD²

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD²

Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0

Yes, that's correct.

So, plugging in the squared distances:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Hmm, interesting. Now, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix.

Computing a 5x5 determinant by hand can be quite tedious, but maybe there's some symmetry here that can help. Let me look at the matrix:

Let me denote the matrix as M.

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

I notice that rows 1, 2, 3, 4 have a sort of symmetry. Let me see if I can exploit any patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant step by step.

But this might take a while. Alternatively, is there a way to find the volume another way? Maybe by using the fact that the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way.

Wait, given that opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is "equifacial" or something similar. But no, equifacial tetrahedrons have all faces congruent, which isn't necessarily the case here.

Alternatively, maybe all faces are congruent triangles? Let me check.

Each face is a triangle with sides of length:

For face ABC: AB=√41, BC=√89, AC=√80.

For face ABD: AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89.

Similarly, for face ACD: AC=√80, CD=√41, AD=√89.

And for face BCD: BC=√89, CD=√41, BD=√80.

So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89 in some order. So, actually, all four faces are congruent triangles. So ABCD is an isohedral tetrahedron, meaning all faces are congruent. That's an important property.

If all four faces are congruent, then the tetrahedron is isohedral, and so it might have some nice symmetry, which could help in computing the inradius.

But maybe it's better to just compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the volume using another method, like Heron's formula for the area of a face and then using some relation for the volume.

But since all faces are congruent, maybe the area of each face is the same.

Wait, so each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. Let's compute its area.

Using Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

But computing this would be messy, and I'm not sure if it would help me find the volume.

Alternatively, maybe I can set coordinates.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Let me place point A at (0,0,0). Then, let me place point B at (x, 0, 0). Point C at (a, b, 0). Point D at (c, d, e).

But this might become too complicated, but perhaps if I take advantage of the symmetry, I can set coordinates such that the centroid is at the origin or something.

Wait, given the edge lengths, maybe it's a symmetrical tetrahedron, so the coordinates could be symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assign coordinates to points such that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide or something.

Wait, another approach: in such a tetrahedron, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps it can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric.

Specifically, maybe the points are arranged such that each coordinate is either (a, b, c) and (-a, -b, -c), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is orthocentric, meaning that all four altitudes intersect at a single point. But I don't know if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the volume using the following formula: V = (1/3) * base area * height. But without knowing the height, that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can find vectors for the edges and compute the scalar triple product.

Wait, let me try assigning coordinates:

Let me let point A be at (0, 0, 0).

Let me let point B be at (x, 0, 0).

Let me let point C be at (0, y, 0).

Let me let point D be at (0, 0, z).

Wait, is this possible? Let's see.

Then, AB would be the distance from A to B, which is sqrt(x²) = |x| = √41 ⇒ x = √41.

AC is the distance from A to C, which is sqrt(y²) = |y| = √80 ⇒ y = √80.

AD is the distance from A to D, which is sqrt(z²) = |z| = √89 ⇒ z = √89.

Now, let's compute the distances between other points:

BC is the distance from B to C, which is sqrt( (x - 0)^2 + (0 - y)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41 + 80) = sqrt(121) = 11. But in the problem, BC is sqrt(89). Hmm, that's a problem because 11 is not equal to sqrt(89).

So, that coordinate system doesn't work because BC is supposed to be sqrt(89). So, this approach doesn't assign the points correctly.

Wait, maybe I need a different coordinate system. Maybe not placing all points along the axes.

Alternatively, perhaps place point A at (0,0,0), point B at (a, 0, 0), point C at (0, b, 0), and point D at (0, 0, c). Then, compute the distances.

So, AB = a = sqrt(41)

AC = b = sqrt(80)

AD = c = sqrt(89)

BC: distance from B to C is sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt
