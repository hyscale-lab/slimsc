Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. There are 900 residents total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, and then they might own other things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, or a garden spade. 

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring,
- 367 own a set of golf clubs,
- 562 own a garden spade,
- And everyone owns a bag of candy hearts.

So, each resident has at least the candy hearts, and some have more. The problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find the number of residents who own all four items.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and Venn diagrams. The principle of inclusion-exclusion might come into play here. Let me recall how that works.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is a bit complicated, but since we're given specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three, maybe I can use that to find the number who have all four.

Wait, let's think about the total number of residents and how they are distributed among the different ownership categories.

So, each resident can be categorized based on how many items they own:
1. Own exactly one item (only candy hearts, since every resident owns that),
2. Own exactly two items,
3. Own exactly three items,
4. Own all four items.

But wait, actually, since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, the possible ownership counts are 1, 2, 3, or 4. But the problem says 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we need to find those who own all four.

Let me denote:
- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only candy hearts),
- b = exactly two items,
- c = exactly three items,
- d = exactly four items.

Given:
- b = 437,
- c = 234,
- Total residents = a + b + c + d = 900.

Our goal is to find d.

But we also have information about the number of people owning each of the other three items. That is, ownership of diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Wait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are a given for everyone. So, the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade are the other three items. So, the four items are candy hearts, diamond, golf, and garden spade.

Wait, no. Wait, let me read again: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three."

So, "these things" refers to the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, each resident owns at least the candy hearts, and some own additional items.

So, the four things are: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (
