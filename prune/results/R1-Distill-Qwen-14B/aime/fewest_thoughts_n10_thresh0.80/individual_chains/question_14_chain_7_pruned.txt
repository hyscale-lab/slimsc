Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special thing about N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I need to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient Q and the remainder R.

Alright, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the greatest such number with that particular property. Let's think about what that property means.

The property is: changing any single digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, if N is, say, a four-digit number ABCD, then changing A to 1 (resulting in 1BCD), changing B to 1 (AB1CD?), wait no, ABCD is four digits, so changing any one digit to 1. So, for ABCD, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD. Changing B to 1 gives A1CD. Changing C to 1 gives AB1D. And changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, N is such that when any one digit is replaced by 1, the number is a multiple of 7. And N is the greatest four-digit number with this property.

Hmm. So, maybe I should consider N as a four-digit number with digits A, B, C, D. So N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we replace A with 1, we get 1BCD, which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Replacing C with 1 gives AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Replacing D with 1 gives ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, for each of these modified numbers, when divided by 7, the remainder is zero.

So, let me write down the four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

I need to find A, B, C, D such that all four of these are true, with N being the largest possible four-digit number.

Since N is the largest possible, we should probably start from 9999 and go downwards, checking for this condition. But that's impractical to do manually, so I need a smarter approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can model these congruencies and solve for A, B, C, D.

First, let's compute each of these expressions modulo 7.

But before that, perhaps compute what 1000, 100, 10, and 1 are modulo 7.

10 mod 7 = 3

100 mod 7: 100 /7 is 14*7=98, so 100 -98=2 → 100 ≡2 mod7.

1000 mod7: Let's compute 1000 divided by7. 7*142 = 994, 1000-994=6 → 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 10000 mod7: 10000 /7=1428*7=9996, 10000-9996=4 → 10000≡4 mod7. But maybe I don't need that here.

So, 1000 ≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1 mod7.

So, let's rewrite each condition.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡0 mod7 → 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. 1000A +100 +10C + D ≡0 mod7 → 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. 1000A +100B +10 + D ≡0 mod7 → 6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. 1000A +100B +10C +1 ≡0 mod7 → 6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, now we have four congruences:

(1) 2B +3C + D ≡ -6 mod7 → 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1).

(2) 6A +3C + D ≡ -2 mod7 → 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

(3) 6A +2B + D ≡ -3 mod7 → 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

(4) 6A +2B +3C ≡ -1 mod7 →6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, this is a system of four congruences with four variables: A, B, C, D. Each variable is a digit, so A is from 1-9 (since it's a four-digit number), and B, C, D from 0-9.

Let me see if I can express these equations in terms that can be substituted or eliminated.

Let me write them again:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7. (Equation 1)
2. 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7. (Equation 2)
3. 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7. (Equation 3)
4. 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7. (Equation 4)

Hmm. Let's see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

First, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation2 - Equation1: (6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) ≡5 -1 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, Equation3 - Equation1: (6A +2B + D) - (2B +3C + D) ≡4 -1 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

So, now we have two new equations:

5. 6A -2B ≡4 mod7. (Equation5)
6. 6A -3C ≡3 mod7. (Equation6)

Also, Equation4 is 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7. (Equation4)

Let me see if I can express B and C in terms of A.

From Equation5: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

I can write this as 2B ≡6A -4 mod7.

Similarly, since 6 ≡6 mod7, and 2 has an inverse modulo7. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So, multiply both sides by 4:

B ≡ (6A -4)*4 mod7.

Compute (6A -4)*4:

6A*4 =24A ≡3A mod7 (since 24/7=3*7=21, 24-21=3)
-4*4 =-16 ≡-16 +21=5 mod7.

So, B ≡3A +5 mod7. (Equation7)

Similarly, from Equation6: 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Factor out 3: 3(2A - C)≡3 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. The inverse of 3 is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

So, C ≡2A -1 mod7. (Equation8)

Now, let's substitute Equations7 and 8 into Equation4.

Equation4: 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Substitute B=3A+5 mod7 and C=2A -1 mod7.

So,

6A + 2*(3A +5) +3*(2A -1) ≡6 mod7.

Compute each term:

6A + 6A +10 +6A -3 ≡6 mod7.

Combine like terms:

(6A +6A +6A) + (10 -3) ≡6 mod7.

18A +7 ≡6 mod7.

18A mod7: 18/7=2*7=14, 18-14=4 →18≡4 mod7. So 4A +7≡6 mod7.

But 7 mod7 is 0, so:

4A ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod7. The inverse of 4 is 2, since 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, A ≡6*2=12 ≡5 mod7.

Thus, A≡5 mod7.

Since A is a digit from 1-9, possible values for A are 5 and 12, but 12 is not a digit, so A=5.

So, A=5.

Now, let's find B and C using Equations7 and 8.

From Equation7: B ≡3A +5 mod7.

A=5, so 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So, B≡1 +5=6 mod7.

Thus, B≡6 mod7. Since B is a digit (0-9), possible values are 6 and 13, but 13 is invalid. So B=6.

From Equation8: C≡2A -1 mod7.

2*5=10≡3 mod7, so C≡3 -1=2 mod7.

So, C≡2 mod7. Possible values are 2 and 9 (since 2+7=9). So C can be 2 or 9.

So, now we have A=5, B=6, and C=2 or 9. Let's see how that affects D.

From Equation1: 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Substituting B=6, C=2 or 9.

Case 1: C=2.

Then, 2*6 +3*2 +D ≡1 mod7.

12 +6 + D ≡1 mod7.

18 + D ≡1 mod7.

18 mod7: 18-14=4, so 4 + D ≡1 mod7 → D ≡-3 ≡4 mod7.

So, D=4 or 11. But D is a digit, so D=4.

Case 2: C=9.

Compute 2*6 +3*9 + D ≡1 mod7.

12 +27 + D ≡1 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5; 27 mod7: 27-3*7=27-21=6. So, 5 +6 + D ≡1 mod7.

11 + D ≡1 mod7. 11 mod7 is 4, so 4 + D ≡1 mod7 → D ≡-3 ≡4 mod7.

Again, D=4 or 11, but D must be a digit. So D=4.

So, in both cases, D=4.

Wait, so regardless of whether C=2 or 9, D=4.

So, possible numbers are:

If C=2: N=5 6 2 4 →5624

If C=9: N=5 6 9 4 →5694

But wait, we're supposed to find the greatest such four-digit number N. So between 5694 and 5624, 5694 is larger.

But wait, hold on. Let me confirm that both numbers satisfy all four conditions.

Wait, let me check for N=5694.

Changing A to 1: 1694. Is 1694 divisible by7?

Compute 1694 ÷7. 7*242=1694. Yes, because 242*7=1694. So that's good.

Changing B to 1: 5194. Is 5194 divisible by7?

Compute 5194 ÷7. 7*742=5194? Let's see: 7*700=4900. 5194-4900=294. 294 ÷7=42. So 700+42=742. So yes, 7*742=5194. Good.

Changing C to1: 5614. 5614 ÷7.

Compute 7*802=5614. 7*800=5600, 5614-5600=14. 14 ÷7=2. So yes, 802*7=5614. Correct.

Changing D to1: 5691. Is 5691 divisible by7?

Compute 5691 ÷7. 7*813=5691. Let's see: 7*800=5600, 5691-5600=91. 91 ÷7=13. So 800+13=813. Yes, 7*813=5691. Correct.

So N=5694 satisfies all conditions.

Now check N=5624.

Changing A to1:1624. 1624 ÷7=232. So yes, 7*232=1624.

Change B to1:5124. 5124 ÷7. 7*732=5124? 7*700=4900, 5124-4900=224. 224 ÷7=32. So 700+32=732. 7*732=5124. Correct.

Change C to1:5614. As above, 5614 ÷7=802. Correct.

Change D to1:5621. Is 5621 ÷7 an integer?

Compute 5621 ÷7. 7*800=5600, 5621-5600=21. 21 ÷7=3. So 800+3=803. 7*803=5621. Correct.

So N=5624 also satisfies all conditions.

But since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, we need to choose the larger of the two, which is 5694.

Wait, but is 5694 the largest possible, or could there be a larger N with a different A, B, C, D?

Wait, in our earlier steps, we found A must be 5 mod7. Since A is a digit from 1-9, A=5 is the only possibility because the next would be 5+7=12, which is invalid. So A=5 is fixed.

Wait, but is that correct? Because when we solved Equation4, we found A≡5 mod7, so A=5 or 12, but 12 is invalid, so A=5. So no, A has to be 5.

So, the maximum possible A is 5. So, with A=5, can we have higher N?

Wait, N=5694 is the higher one between 5694 and 5624. But wait, maybe there are other combinations where C is 2 or 9, but with higher B or D? Wait, but in our case, B is fixed to 6 mod7, so B=6 is the only possible digit (since 6+7=13 is invalid). So B=6 is fixed.

Thus, the only variables are C and D. And from our earlier steps, C can be 2 or 9, leading to D=4 in both cases.

So, if N=5694 is the higher value, then that's our candidate. But wait, is there a larger N when C=9 and D=4, so 5694, which is higher than 5624.

Wait, but let's think if we can have higher N with the same A=5, B=6, but higher C and D.

Wait, but according to our equations, C can only be 2 or 9 because C≡2 mod7. So, possible Cs are 2 and 9. So 5694 is the higher one.

Is there a way to get a higher N than 5694? Let's see, like 5794 or something.

But wait, according to our system, A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4. So N=5694.

Wait, is 5694 indeed the greatest possible?

Wait, maybe I can try a higher C, like 9, but then D=4. So 5694 is the highest possible in that case.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution earlier. Let me re-examine the equations.

Wait, when I substituted, I found that A must be 5 mod7, so A=5. Then B=6, and C can be 2 or 9, leading to D=4.

Wait, but perhaps there are other possibilities when C=9, but D is 11, but D must be a single digit, so D=4.

So, I think 5694 is the maximum possible.

Wait, but let me test N=5694. Let me check all four conditions.

1. Change A to 1: 1694. 1694 ÷7=242, so yes.

2. Change B to 1: 5194. 5194 ÷7=742, yes.

3. Change C to1: 5614. 5614 ÷7=802, yes.

4. Change D to1: 5691. 5691 ÷7=813, yes.

So all four are divisible by7, and N=5694 is the maximum possible four-digit number with this property.

Now, we need to compute Q and R when N is divided by1000.

N=5694.

Dividing by 1000: 5694 ÷1000=5 with a remainder of 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Therefore, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let me make sure that 5694 is indeed the maximum. Because perhaps there is a higher N where changing any digit to1 also gives a number divisible by7.

Wait, for example, let's consider N=5794.

Wait, but for N=5794, let's check the four conditions.

Change A to1:1794. Is 1794 divisible by7? 7*256=1792, 1794-1792=2. So remainder 2, not divisible by7. So N=5794 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Similarly, let's think about N=5695.

Wait, N=5695.

Change D to1:5691. Which is divisible by7.

Change C to1:5615. 5615 ÷7=802.142... No, it's not divisible by7. 7*802=5614, so 5615 is 5614+1, which is not divisible by7.

So, N=5695 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, let's think about N=5694. It works, as we saw.

Wait, what about N=5694, is there a higher number where all four modified numbers are divisible by7?

Wait, perhaps N=5794 didn't work, so let's check N=5704.

Wait, N=5704.

Change A to1:1704. 1704 ÷7=243.428... Not divisible by7. So no.

Change B to1:5104. 5104 ÷7=729.142... Not an integer.

Thus, N=5704 doesn't satisfy.

Hmm, perhaps 5694 is indeed the largest.
