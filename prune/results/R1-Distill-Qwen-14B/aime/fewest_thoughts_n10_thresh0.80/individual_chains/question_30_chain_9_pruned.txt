Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

Hmm, roots of unity, products... I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Maybe I can relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at a certain point.

First, let's write out the product P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Wait, maybe I can factor the expression inside the product. Let's see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me try substituting y = ω^k. Then the expression becomes y² - 2y + 2. So, each term is y² - 2y + 2, which is a quadratic in y. So the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (y² - 2y + 2), where y = ω^k.

Wait, but ω^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12. So, the product is the product of (y² - 2y + 2) for each y being a 13th root of unity.

But how do I compute such a product? I remember that for polynomials, the product over roots can be related to evaluating the polynomial at certain points.

Wait, more precisely, if I have a polynomial f(y) = y^13 - 1, since the roots are the 13th roots of unity.
