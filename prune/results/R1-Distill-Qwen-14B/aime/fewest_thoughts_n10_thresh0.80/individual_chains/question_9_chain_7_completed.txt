Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product xy, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1, and they satisfy two logarithmic equations: log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be manipulated using various properties. Maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me recall the logarithm property: log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, if I apply that to both equations, I can convert them into exponential equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying the property, this should be equivalent to x^10 = y^x. Got that. So, x to the power of 10 equals y to the power of x. Let me write that down:

Equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same property, this becomes y^10 = x^{4y}. So, y to the power of 10 equals x to the power of 4y. Writing that down as Equation 2:

Equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Alright, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find xy. Hmm. Maybe I can express y in terms of x from one equation and substitute it into the other. Let's see.

From Equation 1: x^10 = y^x. Taking both sides to the power of (1/x) might help. So, (x^10)^(1/x) = y. Simplifying the left side, that would be x^(10/x) = y. So, y = x^(10/x). Let me note that down.

So, y is equal to x raised to the power of (10/x). That's Equation 3: y = x^(10/x).

Now, let's substitute this expression for y into Equation 2. Equation 2 is y^10 = x^{4y}. Substituting y, we get:

(y)^10 = (x^(10/x))^10 = x^(100/x) on the left side.

And the right side is x^{4y} = x^{4 * x^(10/x)}.

So, the equation becomes:

x^(100/x) = x^{4 * x^(10/x)}.

Since the bases are the same (both are base x), their exponents must be equal. So, we can set the exponents equal to each other:

100/x = 4 * x^(10/x).

Hmm, okay. So, 100/x equals 4 times x^(10/x). Let me write this as:

100/x = 4 * x^(10/x).

I can simplify this equation. Let's divide both sides by 4 to make it simpler:

25/x = x^(10/x).

So, 25/x equals x^(10/x). Hmm. Let me denote t = x^(1/x). Then, x^(10/x) would be (x^(1/x))^10 = t^10. Let me see if this substitution helps.

Wait, perhaps taking natural logarithms on both sides would make this manageable. Let's try that.

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(25/x) = ln(x^(10/x)).

Simplify the right side: ln(x^(10/x)) = (10/x) * ln(x).

So, the equation becomes:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Let me write that down:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Hmm. Let me denote ln(x) as a variable, say, let’s let z = ln(x). Since x > 1, z will be positive. So, substituting:

ln(25) - z = (10/x) * z.

But wait, x is e^z because z = ln(x), so x = e^z. Therefore, 10/x is 10 e^{-z}.

So, substituting that in, the equation becomes:

ln(25) - z = (10 e^{-z}) * z.

So, ln(25) - z = 10 z e^{-z}.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have a straightforward algebraic solution. Maybe I can rearrange terms to see if I can find a way to express it differently.

Let me move all terms to one side:

ln(25) - z - 10 z e^{-z} = 0.

Hmm, that doesn't look too promising. Maybe another approach. Let me think about the original substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution t = x^(1/x) would be better. Let me try that.

Let’s define t = x^(1/x). So, x = t^x.

Wait, that might not be helpful directly, but let's see.

Wait, earlier I had Equation 3: y = x^(10/x) = (x^(1/x))^10 = t^10.

So, y = t^10.

But from Equation 2, y^10 = x^{4y}.

Wait, let me write down Equation 2 again: y^10 = x^{4y}.

If y = t^10 and x = t^x, then substituting into Equation 2:

(t^10)^10 = (t^x)^{4 * t^10}.

Simplify the left side: t^{100}.

Right side: t^{x * 4 t^10}.

So, t^{100} = t^{4 x t^{10}}.

Since the bases are the same and t > 1 (because x > 1, so t = x^(1/x) > 1^(1/1)=1), we can equate the exponents:

100 = 4 x t^{10}.

So, 100 = 4 x t^{10}.

Hmm, but t = x^(1/x), so t^{10} = (x^(1/x))^{10} = x^{10/x}.

From Equation 3, y = x^{10/x}, so t^{10} = y.

So, substituting back into 100 = 4 x t^{10}:

100 = 4 x y.

Wait, that's perfect because we're trying to find xy. Let me write that down:

100 = 4 x y.

So, dividing both sides by 4:

25 = x y.

So, xy = 25.

Oh, that's the answer! So, the product of x and y is 25.

But wait, let me double-check my steps because that was a bit quick. Let me go through the substitution again.

We set t = x^(1/x), so x = t^x.

Then y = x^(10/x) = (x^(1/x))^{10} = t^{10}.

From Equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Substituting y = t^{10} and x = t^x:

(t^{10})^{10} = (t^x)^{4 * t^{10}}.

Calculates to t^{100} = t^{x * 4 t^{10}}.

Therefore, exponents must be equal: 100 = 4 x t^{10}.

But t^{10} is (x^(1/x))^{10} = x^{10/x} = y.

So, 100 = 4x y, which leads to xy = 25.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the product xy is 25.


To solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into exponential form using the property \(\log_b(a) = c \implies b^c = a\).

1. From \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\), we get \(x^{10} = y^x\).
2. From \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we get \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\).

Next, we express \(y\) in terms of \(x\) from the first equation:

\[
y = x^{10/x}.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation:

\[
(y)^{10} = (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{100/x},
\]
\[
x^{4y} = x^{4 \cdot x^{10/x}}.
\]

Equating the exponents since the bases are the same:

\[
100/x = 4 \cdot x^{10/x}.
\]

Let \(t = x^{1/x}\), so \(x^{10/x} = t^{10}\). Substituting back:

\[
100/x = 4t^{10}.
\]

Since \(t = x^{1/x}\), we have \(t^{10} = y\). Thus:

\[
100 = 4xy.
\]

Solving for \(xy\):

\[
xy = \frac{100}{4} = 25.
\]

The product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
