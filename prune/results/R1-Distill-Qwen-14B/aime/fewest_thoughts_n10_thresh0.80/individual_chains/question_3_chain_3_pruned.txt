Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The problem is about a lottery where Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.

Alright, so first, let's understand the problem. We're dealing with conditional probability here. The probability we need is P(Grand Prize | Prize). Using the formula for conditional probability, that would be:

P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize and Prize) / P(Prize)

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize (since the grand prize requires all four numbers to match, which certainly means at least two match). So, P(Grand Prize and Prize) is just P(Grand Prize). Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

P = P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize)

So, we need to compute two probabilities: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize. Then, we divide the first by the second.

Let's first calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That will be the denominator in our probabilities because it's the total possible outcomes.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10,4), which is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!)). Let me compute that.

C(10,4) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210.

So, the total number of possible sets is 210.

Now, let's compute P(Grand Prize). For the grand prize, Jen has to pick exactly the 4 numbers that are chosen. Since Jen's numbers are fixed, there's only 1 favorable outcome. So, the probability is 1/210.

Wait, hold on, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, let me think.

Wait, no. The total number of possible outcomes for the lottery is C(10,4) = 210. So, the probability that the 4 randomly chosen numbers match Jen's 4 numbers is 1/210. That seems correct because only one specific combination is the winning one.

Now, let's compute P(Prize), the probability that Jen wins at least two numbers. So, she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. This means she could have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers matching. So, we need to compute the number of favorable outcomes for each of these cases and sum them up.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute the probability of the complementary event (i.e., the probability that she doesn't win a prize) and subtract it from 1. The complementary event is that Jen has fewer than two numbers matching, which means she has 0 or 1 numbers matching. So, P(Prize) = 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match).

Let me compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

First, P(0 matches): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S such that none of them are in Jen's 4 numbers. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 6. So, the number of ways
