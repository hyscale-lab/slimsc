Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand all the conditions. The problem says:

"A list of positive integers has the following properties:
- The sum of the items in the list is 30.
- The unique mode of the list is 9.
- The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list."

Alright, so I need to figure out what the list of numbers looks like and then calculate the sum of their squares.

Let me break down the conditions one by one.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them all up, they must equal 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number. And it's the unique mode, meaning no other number can have the same frequency as 9. So 9 must appear at least twice, and more than any other number.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is an integer not in the list. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, but if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. For that average to be an integer that's not in the list, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number (so their average is integer), and that integer must not be present in the list.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which would be an integer. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So that can't happen if the list has an odd number of elements because the median is one of the elements. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements so that the median is an average of two numbers, which might not be present.

Wait, but let me think. For example, if the list has an even number of elements, say 4 numbers,
