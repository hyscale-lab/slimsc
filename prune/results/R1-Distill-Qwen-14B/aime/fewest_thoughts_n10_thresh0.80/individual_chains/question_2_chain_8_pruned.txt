Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC² where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the points given are O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis at a point that's sqrt(3)/2 up, which is about 0.866. So, the triangle OAB is a right triangle with legs OA and OB, each of length 1/2 and sqrt(3)/2, respectively.

Wait, actually, no. Hold on, OA is from (0,0) to (1/2,0), so its length is 1/2. OB is from (0,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), so its length is sqrt(3)/2. So, OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2. That makes triangle OAB a right triangle with legs of 1/2 and sqrt(3)/2, and hypotenuse AB.

Let me calculate the length of AB to confirm. Using the distance formula between A(1/2,0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2):

AB = sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1.

So, AB is a segment of length 1. Interesting.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, such that the length of PQ is 1.

So, for any such PQ, the distance between P(p,0) and Q(0,q) must satisfy sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, p² + q² = 1.

So, the family F is all line segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So, each such segment is a line from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, other than A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, C is only on AB and no other PQ in F. I need to find OC².

So, my goal is to find such a point C on AB, compute OC², express it as a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

Let me visualize this. The first quadrant has the x-axis and y-axis. O is at the origin. A is halfway along the x-axis towards (1,0), and B is up the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB connects these two points and has length 1.

Now, the family F consists of all unit-length segments PQ from the x-axis to the y-axis. So, these are like lines from (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² = 1.

Each such PQ is a line segment in the first quadrant, and they form a sort of envelope or family of curves. The point C is on AB such that it's only on AB and not on any other PQ from F.

So, C is a point on AB that is not intersected by any other segment PQ in F except AB itself. So, C is the unique point where AB is the only PQ in F that passes through it.

I think this point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope, then it only touches the envelope at that single point, which would be C.

What's the envelope of the family F? Each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1.

So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, since it's a line intercepting the x-axis at p and y-axis at q.

Since p² + q² = 1, I can write the equation of PQ as x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

To find the envelope, I can use the method of solving for the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope is found by solving the system:

F(p, q, x, y) = x/p + y/q - 1 = 0

and

dF/dλ = 0,

where λ is a parameter. Wait, but in this case, the parameter is related to p and q. Since p² + q² = 1, perhaps I can parameterize p and q using an angle.

Let me think. Since p² + q² = 1, I can set p = cosθ and q = sinθ for some θ between 0 and π/2. Then, the equation of PQ is x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1.

So, the family of lines is x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1, for θ in (0, π/2).

The envelope can be found by solving:

x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1

and

d/dθ (x/cosθ + y/sinθ - 1) = 0.

So, let's compute the derivative with respect to θ:

d/dθ (x/cosθ + y/sinθ - 1) = x sinθ / cos²θ - y cosθ / sin²θ = 0.

So, x sinθ / cos²θ = y cosθ / sin²θ.

Multiplying both sides by cos²θ sin²θ to eliminate denominators:

x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

So,

x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

Let me write this as x = y (cos³θ)/(sin³θ) = y cot³θ.

So, x = y cot³θ.

Now, from the original equation:

x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1.

Substituting x from the above into this equation:

(y cot³θ)/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1.

Simplify each term.

First term: (y cot³θ)/cosθ.

Cotθ is cosθ/sinθ, so cot³θ = cos³θ / sin³θ.

Thus, (y cos³θ / sin³θ) / cosθ = y cos²θ / sin³θ.

Second term: y / sinθ.

So, the equation becomes:

y cos²θ / sin³θ + y / sinθ = 1.

Factor out y / sinθ:

y / sinθ (cos²θ / sin²θ + 1) = 1.

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

cos²θ / sin²θ + 1 = (cos²θ + sin²θ) / sin²θ = 1 / sin²θ.

So, the equation becomes:

y / sinθ * (1 / sin²θ) = 1.

So,

y / sin³θ = 1.

Hence, y = sin³θ.

Similarly, from x = y cot³θ,

x = sin³θ * (cosθ/sinθ)^3 = sin³θ * (cos³θ / sin³θ) ) = cos³θ.

So, x = cos³θ and y = sin³θ.

Therefore, the envelope of the family F is the curve defined parametrically by x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ for θ in (0, π/2).

This is known as the astroid curve. The astroid can also be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Now, the problem states that the point C is on AB and is the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB itself. So, C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

Therefore, to find C, I need to find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, let's find the equation of AB first.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2).

Simplify:

y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, to find the point of tangency C on AB and the astroid.

We need to find the point (x, y) lying on both AB and the astroid, and such that AB is tangent to the astroid at that point.

So, the point (x, y) is on both AB and the astroid, and the derivative of the astroid at that point is equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

First, let's write the equation of the astroid in Cartesian form: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

To find the derivative, we can differentiate implicitly.

Differentiating both sides with respect to x:

(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0.

Solving for dy/dx:

dy/dx = - [x^(-1/3) / y^(-1/3)] = - [y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)].

So, the slope of the astroid at any point (x, y) is - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).

At the point of tangency, this slope must equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

Therefore,

- (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).

Simplify:

y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) = sqrt(3).

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(y / x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3 * sqrt(3).

So,

y = 3*sqrt(3) x.

But wait, AB has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, set y = 3*sqrt(3) x equal to y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So,

3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Bring all terms to one side:

3*sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2 = 0.

Factor sqrt(3):

sqrt(3) (4x - 1/2) = 0.

Since sqrt(3) ≠ 0,

4x - 1/2 = 0 => 4x = 1/2 => x = 1/8.

So, x = 1/8.

Then, y = 3*sqrt(3) * (1/8) = 3*sqrt(3)/8.

Wait, but wait a second, let's verify this. Because if y = 3*sqrt(3) x, then plugging x = 1/8, y = 3*sqrt(3)/8.

But AB's equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Plugging in x = 1/8:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, that's consistent. So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Wait, but let me check if this point lies on the astroid.

Compute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):

( (1/8) )^(2/3) + ( (3 sqrt(3)/8) )^(2/3 )

= ( (1/8) )^(2/3) + ( (3 sqrt(3)/8) )^(2/3 )
