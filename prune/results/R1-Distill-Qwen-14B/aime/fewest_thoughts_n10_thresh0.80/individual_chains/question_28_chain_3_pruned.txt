Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter to each face. Hmm, I remember that the incenter is like the 3D version of the incenter in a triangle, right? So it's the point equidistant from all the faces, and that distance is the inradius.

Let me jot down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Wait, so each pair of opposite edges are equal. That might imply some symmetry in the tetrahedron. Maybe it's isohedral or something? Not sure, but perhaps I can use that symmetry to find the volume and then find the inradius.

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius r can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to find both V and S.

But first, maybe I should figure out if this tetrahedron has a specific name or properties. Since opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron, I think. Or maybe a disphenoid? Yeah, a disphenoid has opposite edges equal. So yes, this is a disphenoid.

In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me see. In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, so the faces opposite each other should be congruent. So each face should be congruent to its opposite. So each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, and √89? Wait, no, that can't be right because each face is a triangle formed by three edges. Let me think.

Wait, no, each face is a triangle with edges from the given lengths. For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, and AC. So AB is √41, BC is √89, and AC is √80. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, and AD. AB is √41, BD is √80, AD is √89. So each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Wait, so all four faces are congruent triangles. That's interesting. So that means each face has the same area. That might make things easier because then the total surface area is four times the area of one face.

So first, let me compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

Wait, but to compute the area, I can use Heron's formula. So first, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

Compute s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2. Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can find the area another way.

Alternatively, perhaps using the coordinates. Maybe it's easier to assign coordinates to the points and compute the volume and surface area that way.

Yes, assigning coordinates might help since the tetrahedron is symmetric. Let me try that approach.

In a disphenoid, it's possible to place the points such that the coordinates are symmetric. Let me recall that in a disphenoid, the coordinates can be (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c) for some a, b, c. That might give the necessary symmetry.

Wait, let me see. Let's assign points such that:

A = (x, y, z)
B = (-x, -y, z)
C = (-x, y, -z)
D = (x, -y, -z)

This way, the edges AB, AC, AD will have certain lengths, and edges BC, BD, CD will have others. Let me compute the distances.

Compute AB: distance between A and B.

A = (x,y,z), B = (-x,-y,z)

AB distance squared: (x + x)^2 + (y + y)^2 + (z - z)^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x² + 4y².

Given AB = √41, so 4x² +4y² =41. So x² + y² =41/4. (1)

Similarly, compute AC: A = (x,y,z), C = (-x,y,-z)

AC squared: (x +x)^2 + (y - y)^2 + (z + z)^2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 =4x² +4z².

Given AC = √80, so 4x² +4z²=80 → x² + z²=20. (2)

Similarly, compute AD: A = (x,y,z), D = (x,-y,-z)

AD squared: (x -x)^2 + (y + y)^2 + (z + z)^2 =0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2=4y² +4z².

Given AD =√89, so 4y² +4z²=89 → y² + z²=89/4. (3)

Now, from equations (1), (2), (3):

We have:

1) x² + y² =41/4

2) x² + z² =20

3) y² + z² =89/4

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (x² + z²) - (x² + y²) =20 -41/4 → z² - y² =20 -41/4 = (80 -41)/4=39/4.

From equation (3): y² + z²=89/4.

So, now we have:

z² - y² =39/4

z² + y²=89/4

Let me add them:

2z²= (39+89)/4=128/4=32 → z²=16 → z=4 or z=-4. Let's take z=4.

Then, subtract the two equations:

(z² + y²) - (z² - y²)=89/4 -39/4 → 2y²=50/4=25/2 → y²=25/4 → y=5/2 or y=-5/2. Let's take y=5/2.

From equation (1): x² + y²=41/4 → x² +25/4=41/4 → x²=16/4=4 → x=2 or x=-2. Let's take x=2.

So the coordinates are:

A = (2,5/2,4)

B = (-2,-5/2,4)

C = (-2,5/2,-4)

D = (2,-5/2,-4)

Okay, so now I have coordinates for all four points. Now, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.

The formula for the volume given coordinates is V = |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.

Let me compute vectors BA, CA, DA.

Wait, actually, vectors from A to B, A to C, A to D.

Wait, no, the vectors are from A to B, A to C, A to D? Wait, no, the volume is computed using vectors from the same point. So if I take vectors AB, AC, AD, then the
