Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to understand what's going on. Every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the coffee shop time. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, let's break down the information. The first scenario says when she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. The second scenario says when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes at the coffee shop.

I think I need to set up some equations based on this information. Since the walk distance is constant at 9 km, I can use the formula: time = distance / speed. But wait, the time given includes the coffee shop time, so the walking time is the total time minus the coffee shop time.

Let me formalize that. Let's denote t as the time in minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, in the first case, the total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. The walking time would be 240 - t minutes. Similarly, in the second case, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes. So the walking time is 144 - t minutes.

Wait, but speed is in km per hour, so I need to convert these walking times into hours to be consistent. Alternatively, I can convert the speed into km per minute. Hmm, maybe it's better to convert the walking times into hours.

So, for the first scenario: walking time is (240 - t)/60 hours. Because t is in minutes, so (240 - t) minutes is (240 - t)/60 hours.

Similarly, the second scenario: walking time is (144 - t)/60 hours.

Now, using the formula time = distance / speed, the walking time is 9 km divided by the speed.

So, for the first scenario: (240 - t)/60 = 9 / s.

Similarly, for the second scenario: (144 - t)/60 = 9 / (s + 2).

Now I have two equations:

1. (240 - t)/60 = 9 / s
2. (144 - t)/60 = 9 / (s + 2)

I can rewrite these equations to make them easier to work with. Let's multiply both sides by 60 to eliminate the denominators.

Equation 1 becomes: 240 - t = (9 * 60) / s = 540 / s

Equation 2 becomes: 144 - t = 540 / (s + 2)

So now I have:

240 - t = 540 / s  --> Equation A

144 - t = 540 / (s + 2)  --> Equation B

Hmm, I can subtract Equation B from Equation A to eliminate t.

(240 - t) - (144 - t) = (540 / s) - (540 / (s + 2))

Simplify the left side: 240 - t -144 + t = 96

Right side: 540 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] 

So 96 = 540 [ (s + 2 - s) / (s(s + 2)) ) ]

Simplify the numerator in the brackets: s + 2 - s = 2

So, 96 = 540 * (2) / [s(s + 2)]

Which simplifies to 96 = (1080)
