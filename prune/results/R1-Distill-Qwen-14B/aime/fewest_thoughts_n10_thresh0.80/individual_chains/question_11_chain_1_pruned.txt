Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers and their properties. I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then z can be written as r times e^(iθ), where θ is the argument of z. Since the modulus is 4, z = 4e^(iθ).

Wait, maybe I should express z in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let me think. Let z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, and x² + y² = 16 because |z| =4.

So, the expression is (75 + 117i)(x + yi) + (96 + 144i)/(x + yi). Hmm, that looks a bit messy, but maybe I can simplify it.

First, let's compute (75 + 117i)(x + yi). Multiplying complex numbers: (75x - 117y) + (75y + 117x)i. Right, because (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i.

Next, compute (96 + 144i)/(x + yi). To simplify this, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is x - yi. So:

(96 + 144i)(x - yi) / (x² + y²). Since x² + y² =16, denominator is 16.

So expanding numerator: 96x + 144y i -96yi -144x i². Wait, i² is -1, so this becomes 96x + 144y i -96yi +144x.

Combine like terms: (96x +144x) + (144y -96y)i = 240x + 48y i.

So, (96 +144i)/(x + yi) = (240x + 48y i)/16 = (15x + 3y i).

Putting it all together, the entire expression is:

[(75x -117y) + (75y +117x)i] + [15x +3y i] 

Combine real parts and imaginary parts:

Real part: 75x -117y +15x = 90x -117y

Imaginary part: 75y +117x +3y = 117x +78y

So the expression is (90x -117y) + (117x +78y)i.

We are only interested in the real part, which is 90x -117y. So, we need to maximize 90x -117
