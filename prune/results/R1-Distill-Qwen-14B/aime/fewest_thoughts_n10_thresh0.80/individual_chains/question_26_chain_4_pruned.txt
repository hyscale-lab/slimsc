Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then give m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let's visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.

Tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the exsimilicenter of ω with respect to points B and C? Or wait, since it's the intersection of tangents, D is called the exsymmedian point or something like that? Maybe I should recall that the point where two tangents meet is called the external homothety center or something.

Wait, no, more accurately, D is the ex-pole of line BC with respect to circle ω. Alternatively, since the tangents from D to ω touch at B and C, D is the ex-pole. Another way: D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC? Maybe not exactly, but perhaps it's related.

But perhaps more straightforward: since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, then BD and CD are both tangents to ω, so BD = CD because the lengths from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, triangle BDC is isoceles with BD = CD.

But I'm not sure if that's directly useful yet.

We're told that line AD intersects ω again at point P. So, point P is the second intersection point of AD with ω. Our goal is to find AP.

Given the sides of triangle ABC, maybe we can compute some lengths or angles first. Wait, but the triangle sides are 5, 9, 10. Let me check if it's a right-angled triangle.

Let me compute 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is less than 10² = 100? Wait, 10² is 100. Wait, 5² + 9² = 106 > 10². So, it's an acute triangle. So, angle at A is acute.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, because point D is related to the tangents, and knowing the circumradius might help.

The formula for the circumradius R is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So, first, let's compute the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula.

Given sides a=5, b=9, c=10.

Wait, hold on: Wait, in triangle ABC, sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

So, sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, the sides opposite to A, B, C are a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, side a is opposite to angle A, which is BC, which is 9. Side b is opposite to angle B, which is AC=10. Side c is opposite to angle C, which is AB=5.

So, sides: a=9, b=10, c=5.

Then, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9+10+5)/2 = 24/2 =12.

Then, the area Δ = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = sqrt[12*(12-9)*(12-10)*(12-5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt(504). Let's factor 504: 504 = 16 * 31.5, but wait, 504 is 16 * 31.5? No, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504. Wait, but 16 * 31.5 is 504, but that's not helpful. Let me factor 504 properly.

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷ 2 = 126
