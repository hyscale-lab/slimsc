Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but I think I can work through it step by step.

Let me write down the given equations to make it clearer. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10, and the second is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. I remember that logarithms can be manipulated using certain properties, so maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms to simplify them.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which states that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a), I can bring the exponent x down. So, log_x(y^x) becomes x * log_x(y). Therefore, the first equation simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Wait a minute, I have two equations now:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I think I can express both equations in terms of log_x(y) or log_y(x), which might allow me to set them equal or find a relationship between x and y. Let me recall that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is the reciprocal of log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier, say let’s call it k. Then log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So, let’s set k = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) = 1/k.

Substituting into the equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. 4y * (1/k) = 10

So now, equation 1: x * k = 10, equation 2: 4y / k = 10.

From equation 1, I can express x as x = 10 / k.

From equation 2, I can express y as y = (10 * k) / 4, which simplifies to y = (5k)/2.

Now, since k is log_x(y), and I've expressed x and y in terms of k, perhaps I can substitute these expressions back into the definition of k to solve for k.

So, k = log_x(y). But wait, x is 10/k and y is (5k)/2. So, substituting, we have:

k = log_{10/k} (5k/2)

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but let me see if I can express this logarithm in terms of natural logarithms or something more manageable. Remember that log_a(b) = ln(b) / ln(a). So, applying that here:

k = ln(5k/2) / ln(10/k)

Let me write that out:

k = [ln(5k/2)] / [ln(10/k)]

Hmm, this looks like an equation involving k that I might need to solve algebraically. Let me simplify the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, the numerator: ln(5k/2) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2). Or wait, actually, ln(5k/2) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2), but that's not the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, I can write it as ln( (5/2) * k ) = ln(5/2) + ln(k).

Similarly, the denominator: ln(10/k) = ln(10) - ln(k).

So substituting back, we have:

k = [ln(5/2) + ln(k)] / [ln(10) - ln(k)]

Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe cross-multiplying can help. Let me multiply both sides by the denominator to eliminate the fraction:

k * [ln(10) - ln(k)] = ln(5/2) + ln(k)

Expanding the left side:

k * ln(10) - k * ln(k) = ln(5/2) + ln(k)

Now, let's bring all terms to one side:

k * ln(10) - k * ln(k) - ln(5/2) - ln(k)
