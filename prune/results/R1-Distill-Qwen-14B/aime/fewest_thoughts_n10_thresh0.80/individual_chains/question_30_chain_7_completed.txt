Alright, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this. First, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because ω ≠ 1, so it's not the trivial root. That means ω^13 = 1, and all the powers of ω from k=0 to 12 are distinct and cover all the 13th roots of unity.

The expression I need to evaluate is the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That's a product over all the 13th roots of unity, each term being (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1. So plugging that in, the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So the first term is 1. That might not complicate things too much.

But for k=1 to 12, these are the non-trivial roots. Hmm.

I wonder if there's a way to rewrite the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} in a more manageable form. Let me factor or manipulate it.

Let me write it as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k, so the expression becomes x^2 - 2x + 2.

So for each x = ω^k, which is a root of x^13 = 1, the term is x^2 - 2x + 2.

Therefore, the product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x runs through all the 13th roots of unity, including x=1.

Wait, but since x^13 = 1, for each x, the equation x^13 - 1 = 0. So the minimal polynomial for ω is the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x), which is of degree 12. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet.

But I know that the product over all roots x of a polynomial P(x) is related to the constant term of P(x), but here we're taking a product of expressions evaluated at each root.

Wait, perhaps I can relate this product to a polynomial whose roots are x^2 - 2x + 2 evaluated at each 13th root of unity. Or wait, maybe I can think of the product as evaluating a certain polynomial at x=0 or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (x - a_k) is equal to x^13 - 1, since the a_k are the 13th roots of unity. But here, the terms are quadratic in x, so maybe I need to construct a polynomial whose roots are the terms (x^2 - 2x + 2) for each x being a 13th root.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think differently. Let's consider the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1. The roots are the 13th roots of unity. Then, perhaps I can evaluate f( something ) in a way that relates to the given product.

Alternatively, since each term is x^2 - 2x + 2, maybe I can express this as a quadratic in x and relate it to f(x). Hmm, perhaps not directly.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote y = x - 1. Then, x = y + 1. Substitute into the quadratic expression:

x^2 - 2x + 2 = (y + 1)^2 - 2(y + 1) + 2 = y^2 + 2y + 1 - 2y - 2 + 2 = y^2 + (2y - 2y) + (1 - 2 + 2) = y^2 + 1.

So, x^2 - 2x + 2 = y^2 + 1, where y = x - 1.

That's interesting. So, for each x being a 13th root of unity, the term becomes y^2 + 1, with y = x - 1.

So, the product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (y^2 + 1), where y = x - 1 and x are the 13th roots of unity. So x runs through ω^0, ω^1, ..., ω^{12}.

But y = x - 1, so y ranges over the values x=1: y=0; x=ω: y=ω - 1; x=ω^2: y=ω^2 - 1; etc.

So the product is Π_{k=0}^{12} ( (ω^k - 1)^2 + 1 ). Wait, because y = ω^k -1, so y^2 + 1 is (ω^k -1)^2 +1.

Wait, but (ω^k -1)^2 +1 = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 1 +1 = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k +2, which matches the original expression. So that substitution worked.

So, the product is Π_{k=0}^{12} [ (ω^k -1)^2 + 1 ].

Hmm, perhaps another way. Let me consider that for each root ω^k, (ω^k -1)^2 +1 is the same as (ω^{k} - 1)^2 + 1.

Wait, so [ (ω^k -1)^2 + 1 ] = (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

So, going back to the product, perhaps I can express this as the product over all 13th roots of x of (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x = ω^k.

But I'm not sure how to compute that product yet.

Wait, another thought: The product over all x (13th roots of unity) of (x^2 - 2x + 2) can be thought of as evaluating the product when x runs through all the roots. Since x^13 = 1, perhaps we can relate this polynomial to x^13 -1.

Wait, if I have a polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, then the product over all roots x of (f(x)) would be the product of f(x) for each x being a root of x^13 -1 = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the product is equal to the resultant or something, but I might be getting into more complicated territory.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the product as the value of another polynomial evaluated at a certain point. Let me think: Let’s say I have a polynomial P(y) = Π_{k=0}^{12} (y - f(ω^k)), where f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then, the product I need is P(0) because it's the product of (-f(ω^k)) for each k.

Wait, no. Wait, P(y) = Π_{k=0}^{12} (y - f(ω^k)). So, P(0) would be Π_{k=0}^{12} (-f(ω^k)) = (-1)^13 * Π f(ω^k) = -Π f(ω^k). So not exactly the product we need, but it's related.

But maybe I can find P(y) as some other polynomial, perhaps related to the minimal polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find that the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to something when x runs through all 13th roots.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that the product over k=0 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x=ω^k is equal to the product of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2) for each k.

Wait, but that's exactly the same as the product given in the problem. So, perhaps I can think of this product as the product over all 13th roots x of (x^2 - 2x + 2).

Hmm, perhaps if I can find a polynomial Q(x) whose roots are the values of x^2 - 2x + 2 for each 13th root x.

Wait, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can express x^2 - 2x + 2 in terms of (x - a)(x - b) for some a and b, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me compute the roots of x^2 - 2x + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i. So, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, the product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) where x=ω^k.

Wait, that's the same as Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Hmm, so the product is Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) * Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)).

But since ω^k are the roots of x^13 -1 = 0, the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1.

Wait, yes! So, Π_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1.

Therefore, Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = a^13 - 1, because if I substitute x = a into x^13 -1, I get a^13 -1, but the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 -1. But since I have (ω^k - a) = -(a - ω^k), so the product becomes (-1)^13 * Π (a - ω^k) = - (a^13 - 1).

Wait, so Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^{13} * (a^13 - 1) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.

So, for each a, Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = 1 - a^13.

Therefore, applying this to a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i, the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^13, and similarly Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^13.

So, the original product is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].

So now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract each from 1, and then multiply the results.

Hmm, okay. Let's compute (1 + i)^13 first.

I know that (1 + i) can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Raising this to the 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the exponent in the exponential is 13*(π/4) = (13π)/4. Let's reduce that modulo 2π:

13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = 3π + π/4. Since 3π is more than 2π, subtract 2π: 3π - 2π = π, so 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

Wait, no. Wait, 13π/4 divided by 2π is (13/4) / 2 = 13/8, which is 1 and 5/8. So, subtracting 2π once: 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

So, e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i * 5π/4}.

And 5π/4 is in the third quadrant, so cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).

Compute that: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13. Let's compute that.

1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

Raising this to 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Again, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64*sqrt(2).

The angle is -13π/4. Let's reduce this modulo 2π.

-13π/4 + 4π = (-13π + 16π)/4 = 3π/4. Because adding 4π (which is 2 full rotations) brings it to a positive angle.

So, e^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{i * 3π/4}.

3π/4 is in the second quadrant, so cos(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3π/4) = sqrt(2)/2.

So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4)] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

Factor out sqrt(2)/2: 64*sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 * (-1 + i) = 64 * (2)/2 * (-1 + i) = 64 * 1 * (-1 + i) = -64*(1 - i).

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2, right? So, 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) for the real part and 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) for the imaginary part.

So, for real part: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2/2) = -64.

Imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(2/2) = 64.

So, (1 - i)^13 = (-64) + 64i = -64(1 - i).

Wait, that doesn't match what I thought earlier. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle.

Wait, let me recast 1 - i as sqrt(2) e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i*(13π/4)}.

Now, 13π/4 is the same as 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to π/4 in the third revolution, but when negative, it's like rotating clockwise. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the angle modulo 2π.

-13π/4 is equivalent to -13π/4 + 4π = (-13π +16π)/4 = 3π/4.

So, e^{-i*(13π/4)} = e^{i*(3π/4)}. So, the angle is 3π/4, so cos(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3π/4) = sqrt(2)/2.

Thus, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4)).

(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

So, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].

Compute each part:

64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1) = 64*(2)/2*(-1) = 64*1*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) i = 64*(2)/2 * i = 64*1*i = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i = -64(1 - i). Wait, no, because 64i is separate. So, it's -64 + 64i = -64(1 - i), right? Because 64i = 64*(i), so -64 + 64i = 64*(-1 + i) = 64*(-(1 - i)).

Wait, yeah, that seems correct.

So, now, we can go back to the product:

Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - [ -64(1 + i) ] = 1 +64(1 + i) = 65 + 64i.

Similarly, Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - [ -64(1 - i) ] = 1 +64(1 - i) = 65 - 64i.

So, the original product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i).

Which is 65^2 - (64i)^2 = 65^2 - (64^2)(i^2) = 65^2 - (64^2)(-1) = 65^2 + 64^2.

Compute 65^2: 4225.

Compute 64^2: 4096.

So, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Hmm, so the product is 8321.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that multiplication.

(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65*65 + 65*(-64i) + 64i*65 + 64i*(-64i).

Simplify each term:

65*65 = 4225.

65*(-64i) = -4160i.

64i*65 = 4160i.

64i*(-64i) = -4096 i^2 = -4096*(-1) = 4096.

So, adding up all the terms:

4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.

The -4160i and +4160i cancel out, leaving 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct.

So the product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this is divided by 1000.

So, 8321 divided by 1000: 8*1000 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321.

So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in earlier steps.

Let me recap:

We started with the product from k=0 to12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

We noticed that when k=0, the term is 1, so that's okay.

We rewrote each term as x^2 - 2x +2, where x=ω^k.

Then, we made a substitution y = x -1, leading to x^2 -2x +2 = y^2 +1, where y = x -1.

Wait, but perhaps that wasn't necessary because we found another approach by factoring.

Wait, in any case, we then realized that the product over all x (13th roots of unity) of (x^2 -2x +2) equals the product over x of (x - (1 +i))(x - (1 -i)).

Then, using the fact that the product over x of (x - a) is a^13 -1, but with a sign change because we have (x - a) = -(a - x), so the product becomes (-1)^13*(a^13 -1) = 1 - a^13.

So, for a =1 +i and a=1 -i, we computed (1 +i)^13 and (1 -i)^13, which were -64(1 +i) and -64(1 -i), respectively.

Then, 1 - (1 +i)^13 = 1 +64(1 +i) =65 +64i.

Similarly, 1 - (1 -i)^13 =65 -64i.

Multiplying these gives 65^2 +64^2 =8321.

Then, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Yes, that all seems correct.

I think the answer is 321.


The product is calculated by recognizing that each term can be expressed as a quadratic in the 13th roots of unity, leading to a product involving complex numbers. After simplifying, the product is found to be 8321. The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:

\boxed{321}
