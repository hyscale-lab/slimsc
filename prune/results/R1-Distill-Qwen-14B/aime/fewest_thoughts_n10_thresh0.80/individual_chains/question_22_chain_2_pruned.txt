Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon, ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That means AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Also, it's equilateral, so all the sides are equal in length. Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'.

The problem says that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length 's' of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal. So, it's like a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all sides and angles equal, only that opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, it's equilateral but not necessarily regular.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. That must mean that these three sides meet when extended, forming a larger triangle outside the hexagon. Since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, their extensions would create lines that intersect to form this triangle.

Let me think about similar triangles and proportions. Maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the hexagon's sides in some way.

Wait, in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the sides can be thought of as being part of three larger parallelograms. Since each pair of opposite sides is parallel and equal, the hexagon can be inscribed in a way that these sides form three parallelograms around a central triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle formed by AB, CD, EF is similar to the triangle formed by their extensions. If that's the case, the sides of the triangle would be scaled versions of the hexagon's sides.

But I'm not sure if they are similar. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the sides of the triangle are related to the side length 's' of the hexagon through some proportional relationships.

Let me consider the directions of the sides. Since opposite sides are parallel, the sides AB, CD, EF must be in the same direction, each pair opposite. Wait, but in a hexagon, each consecutive side is a rotation of 60 degrees? No, wait, in a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees, but in this case, the hexagon is equilateral but
