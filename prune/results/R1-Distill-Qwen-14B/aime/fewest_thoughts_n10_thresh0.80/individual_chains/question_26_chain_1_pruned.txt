Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We’re given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. Alright, let's visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. It's inscribed in a circle, so ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, I think D is called the exsimilicenter or something. But maybe more importantly, D is the intersection of the two tangents.

AD is drawn and it meets the circle again at P. So, AP is part of AD inside the circle, and PD is the external part. We need to find AP.

Hmm, okay, so first, maybe I should find some properties of triangle ABC. Since we know all three sides, maybe compute some key elements like the circumradius, or maybe use similar triangles, or power of a point.

Wait, the Power of a Point theorem might be useful here because D is outside the circle, and we have tangents from D to the circle. Remember, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 = DC^2 because DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω. So, DB = DC.

So, point D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC? Or maybe on the A-symmedian? Wait, not necessarily, since symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Power of a Point. Since D is outside the circle, the power of D is DB^2 = DC^2 = DP * DA. So, if I can find DB, then I can express DP in terms of DA. But I don't know DA yet, but maybe if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and thus AP.

Wait, but how do I find DA or DB?

Alternatively, maybe use coordinate geometry or trigonometry. Since the sides are given, perhaps I can compute some angles or use the Law of Cosines.

Let me try to compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. Maybe that will help. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Area). So, first, I need the area.

Given sides a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

Using Heron's formula: s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 +5)/2 = 24/2 =12.

Area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) = sqrt(12*(12-9)*(1
