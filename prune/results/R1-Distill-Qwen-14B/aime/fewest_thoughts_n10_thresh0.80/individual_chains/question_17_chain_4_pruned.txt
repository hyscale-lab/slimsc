Okay, so I have this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me understand the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The radius of this sphere will vary depending on the dimensions of the box, but since the surface area and volume are fixed, there must be a way to express the dimensions in terms of variables and then find the maximum necessary sphere radius.

Wait, but actually, since the sphere must contain all possible boxes in set B, the radius has to be the maximum possible distance from the center of the sphere to any corner of the boxes. So the sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box. So for each box, the space diagonal is sqrt(l² + w² + h²), and the radius r would be half of that. Therefore, r² would be (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So my goal is to minimize the maximum possible space diagonal for boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Alternatively, since r² is proportional to the space diagonal squared, I can just find the maximum value of (l² + w² + h²), and then divide by 4 to get r².

Wait, but wait a minute, isn't the space diagonal the same regardless of the box's orientation in the sphere? So the sphere's radius must be at least half of the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the minimal enclosing sphere for each box has radius equal to half the space diagonal, and the maximum such radius over all boxes in B would be the radius r we're looking for.

So, to find r², I need to find the maximum possible value of (l² + w² + h²)/4 for boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.

So, let me write down the constraints:

Surface area S = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54.

Volume V = lwh = 23.

We need to find the maximum of l² + w² + h² given these constraints.

So, let me set up the problem. Let me denote the dimensions as x, y, z for simplicity.

So,

2(xy + xz + yz) = 54 => xy + xz + yz = 27.

xyz = 23.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

Hmm. So, how can I approach this? Maybe using the method of Lagrange multipliers since we're dealing with optimization under constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Let me consider that for fixed surface area and volume, the shape
