Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis. Hmm, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so a bit less than 1 unit up on the y-axis.

Then, we're given a family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1. Also, all these segments are in the first quadrant, so p and q are positive.

The problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB.

The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is a segment in F. So, C is a point on AB that's not on any other segment from F. So, except for AB itself, none of the other segments in F pass through C.

We need to find OC^2, where O is the origin, and then express it as p/q with p and q coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, so I need to figure out the coordinates of point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment from family F except AB. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's parametrize segment AB. Since it's from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), any point on AB can be written as (1/2 - t/2, 0 + t*sqrt(3)/2) where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, parametric equations:

x = 1/2 - (t/2)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) * t

Alternatively, using a parameter s from 0 to 1, the point can be written as:

x = (1 - s) * (1/2) + s * 0 = (1 - s)/2
y = (1 - s) * 0 + s * (sqrt(3)/2) = s * sqrt(3)/2

So, C is a point on AB, so its coordinates are ((1 - s)/2, s*sqrt(3)/2) for some s between 0 and 1, not equal to 0 (which would be A) or 1 (which would be B). 

Now, we need to find s such that C is not on any other segment PQ from F besides AB. So, if we can find C with coordinates (x, y) on AB, such that there's no other segment PQ (from F) that passes through (x, y), except AB itself.

Wait, but since all the segments in F are of unit length from the x-axis to y-axis, each such segment is from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1, because the length is 1.

So, each segment is the line between (p, 0) and (0, q), and we can write the equation of such a line.

The equation of the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. Since p^2 + q^2 = 1, because the length is 1.

So, for a point (x, y) to lie on such a segment PQ, it must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1, where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

But we want the point C to lie only on AB and no other such PQ.

So, if I can find a (x, y) on AB such that the only solution to x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2=1 is when (p, q) corresponds to AB itself.

Wait, AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), so p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2. Let me verify that p^2 + q^2 = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1, yes, so AB is in F.

So, if for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2=1 has only one solution, which is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, then C is the point we are looking for.

Alternatively, if for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has more than one solution (p, q) with p^2 + q^2=1, then C lies on multiple segments in F, which we don't want. So we need the point C where the equation x/p + y/q =1 and p^2 + q^2=1 have exactly one solution, which is when p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2.

So, how do we find such a point? Let me think.

We can think of the system:

x/p + y/q =1

p^2 + q^2=1

We can try to solve for p and q in terms of x and y. Then, to have only one solution (p, q), the system must have a unique solution.

So, let's set up the system.

x/p + y/q =1 --> equation (1)

p^2 + q^2 =1 --> equation (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for, say, q in terms of p.

From equation (1), x/p + y/q =1 --> y/q = 1 - x/p --> q = y / (1 - x/p )

But that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe we can manipulate the equations.

Let me write equation (1) as:

x q + y p = p q

So,

x q + y p - p q =0

Hmm, perhaps we can express this differently. Let me factor:

q(x - p) + y p =0

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps express q from equation (1):

From equation (1), x/p + y/q =1 --> y/q = 1 - x/p --> q = y / (1 - x/p )

Then substitute into equation (2):

p^2 + [y/(1 - x/p)]^2 =1

But this seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.

Let me let’s denote t = p. Then,

q = y / (1 - x/t )

So, equation (2) becomes:

t^2 + [ y / (1 - x/t ) ]^2 =1

Let me compute that:

t^2 + [ y^2 ] / (1 - x/t )^2 =1

Hmm, that's a quartic in t, which might be messy. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution variables.

Let me consider u = p and v = q. Then, equation (1) is x/u + y/v =1, and equation (2) is u^2 + v^2 =1.

We can think of this as a system in u and v. So, the problem is, for given x and y, how many solutions (u, v) in positive real numbers exist for this system.

If the point (x, y) is such that this system has only one solution (u, v), then that's the point C we need.

So, to find C on AB such that the system has only one solution (u, v) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, perhaps to find x and y such that the system has exactly one solution.

So, how can we analyze the number of solutions to this system.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the problem as the envelope of all the lines in F. The point C would lie on the envelope. Wait, that's a thought. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.

In this case, the family F consists of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2=1. So, the envelope of this family might be a curve that is tangent to each of these lines.

So, maybe point C is the point of tangency where the envelope touches AB. Because, if a point is on the envelope, then it's on only one line from the family, which would be the tangent line at that point.

So, if we can find the envelope of F, then find where it intersects AB, that should give us the point C.

So, let's compute the envelope of the family F.

To find the envelope of the family of curves F: x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.

The envelope can be found using the method of solving for p and q in terms of x and y, such that the system has a solution, and the Jacobian determinant is zero.

Alternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers because of the constraint p^2 + q^2=1.

Let me try the Lagrange multipliers approach.

We can consider F: x/p + y/q =1 with constraint G: p^2 + q^2=1.

We can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x/p + y/q - λ(p^2 + q^2 -1)

Taking partial derivatives with respect to p, q, and λ, and setting them to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂p = -x/p^2 - 2λ p =0
Compute ∂L/∂q = -y/q^2 - 2λ q =0
Compute ∂L/∂λ = -(p^2 + q^2 -1) =0

So, from the first equation: -x/p^2 - 2λ p =0 --> x/p^2 = -2λ p --> λ = -x/(2 p^3 )

Similarly, from the second equation: -y/q^2 -2λ q =0 --> y/q^2 = -2λ q --> λ = -y/(2 q^3 )

Set the two expressions for λ equal:

-x/(2 p^3 ) = -y/(2 q^3 )

Simplify:

x / p^3 = y / q^3 --> (x / y) = (p^3 / q^3 ) --> (x/y) = (p/q)^3

So,

p/q = (x/y)^(1/3 )

Let me denote (x/y)^(1/3 ) = k.

So, p = k q

Now, from the constraint p^2 + q^2 =1:

(k q)^2 + q^2 =1 --> q^2 (k^2 +1 ) =1 --> q^2 = 1/(k^2 +1 )

So, q=1/sqrt(k^2 +1 )

Similarly, p = k / sqrt(k^2 +1 )

But k = (x/y)^(1/3 )

So, let's write:

q = 1/ sqrt( (x/y)^(2/3 ) + 1 )

p = (x/y)^(1/3 ) / sqrt( (x/y)^(2/3 ) +1 )

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps manageable.

Now, from the envelope condition, we can express the envelope curve.

But perhaps we can express this in terms of x and y.

Wait, alternatively, we can write the equation of the envelope by eliminating p and q.

We have:

From the envelope conditions:

p = k q

And from the original equation: x/p + y/q =1

So, substituting p =k q into x/p + y/q =1:

x/(k q) + y/q =1 --> (x/k + y)/q =1 --> q = x/k + y

But from p =k q, and p^2 + q^2 =1:

(k q)^2 + q^2 =1 --> q^2 (k^2 +1 )=1 --> q^2 =1/(k^2 +1 )

So, q = 1/sqrt(k^2 +1 )

But from above, q = x/k + y --> 1/sqrt(k^2 +1 ) = (x/k + y )

So,

1/sqrt(k^2 +1 ) = (x/k + y )

Let me square both sides:

1/(k^2 +1 ) = (x/k + y )^2

Expanding the right side:

= x^2 /k^2 + 2 x y /k + y^2

So,

1/(k^2 +1 ) = x^2 /k^2 + 2 x y /k + y^2

Multiply both sides by (k^2 +1 ):

1 = (x^2 /k^2 + 2 x y /k + y^2 ) (k^2 +1 )

Let me compute the right-hand side:

= x^2 /k^2 * k^2 + x^2 /k^2 *1 + 2 x y /k * k^2 + 2 x y /k *1 + y^2 *k^2 + y^2 *1

Simplify each term:

1. x^2 /k^2 * k^2 = x^2
2. x^2 /k^2 *1 = x^2 /k^2
3. 2 x y /k *k^2 = 2 x y k
4. 2 x y /k *1 = 2 x y /k
5. y^2 *k^2 = y^2 k^2
6. y^2 *1 = y^2

So, adding all together:

x^2 + x^2 /k^2 + 2 x y k + 2 x y /k + y^2 k^2 + y^2 = 1

Hmm, this is getting quite complicated. Maybe I can collect like terms.

Let me group terms by powers of k:

Terms with k^2: x^2 /k^2 + 2 x y k + y^2 k^2

Wait, no, more carefully:

Wait, let's see:

Looking at each term:

x^2 is a constant term.

x^2 /k^2 is a term with 1/k^2.

2 x y k is a term with k.

2 x y /k is a term with 1/k.

y^2 k^2 is a term with k^2.

y^2 is a constant term.

So, grouping:

Constant terms: x^2 + y^2

1/k^2 terms: x^2 /k^2

k terms: 2 x y k

1/k terms: 2 x y /k

k^2 terms: y^2 k^2

So, we have:

x^2 + y^2 + x^2 /k^2 + 2 x y k + 2 x y /k + y^2 k^2 =1

Hmm, perhaps factor this expression.

Let me try to write it as:

(x^2 + y^2) + (x^2 /k^2 + y^2 k^2 ) + 2 x y (k + 1/k ) =1

Hmm, perhaps recognizing that x^2 /k^2 + y^2 k^2 = (x/k)^2 + (y k)^2, which is similar to terms in the equation.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps let me set t = k + 1/k. Then, t^2 = k^2 + 2 + 1/k^2, so k^2 +1/k^2 = t^2 -2.

Similarly, x^2 /k^2 + y^2 k^2 = (x^2 + y^2)(k^2 +1/k^2 ) - 2 x y (k - 1/k )

Wait, maybe that's pushing it.

Alternatively, let me consider that perhaps the entire equation can be written as (something)^2.

Wait, let's see:

Suppose I think of the equation as:

[ sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ] + [ sqrt(x^2 /k^2 + y^2 k^2 ) ] + [ 2 x y (k + 1/k ) ] =1

But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can write the equation as:

(x^2 + y^2) + (x^2/k^2 + y^2 k^2 ) + 2 x y (k +1/k ) =1

Let me denote u = k + 1/k, then k^2 +1/k^2 = u^2 -2.

So,

(x^2 + y^2) + (x^2/k^2 + y^2 k^2 ) + 2 x y u =1

But x^2/k^2 + y^2 k^2 = (x/k)^2 + (y k)^2.

Wait, perhaps using Cauchy-Schwarz
