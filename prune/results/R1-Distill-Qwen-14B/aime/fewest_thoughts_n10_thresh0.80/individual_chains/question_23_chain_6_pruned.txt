Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right because the positive term is with x².

Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, so BD is one of the diagonals, and I need to find a lower bound for BD squared, but the question is phrased a bit differently—it's asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, it's essentially the infimum of BD², but phrased as the greatest number less than BD² for all cases.

Let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, that's a square. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular? Or are they? Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, I think I might be confusing. Let me check: In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A, B, C, D are the vertices of the rhombus, then the coordinates of the points must be such that the origin is their midpoint.

Let me assign coordinates to these points. Let's say that point A is (x, y), then point C, being opposite, would be (-x, -y), because the origin is the midpoint. Similarly
