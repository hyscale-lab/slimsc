Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I know that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So any path will consist of a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. 

But the catch here is that the path must change direction exactly four times. Changing direction would mean switching from an R to a U or from a U to an R. So, starting from the first step, if I go right, the next change would be to up, and so on.

Wait, so if the path changes direction four times, how many segments will the path have? Each direction change marks the end of one segment and the start of another. So, if you change direction four times, you'll have five segments in total. Because the first segment is just the initial direction without a prior change. For example, if the path starts with right and then changes direction four times, it'll have segments: right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up. Wait, that's four changes and five segments. So, each direction change adds a new segment.

So, the path is divided into five segments, each consisting of consecutive steps in the same direction. Each segment is either all R's or all U's.

Now, since the grid is 8x8, the total number of R steps is 8 and the total number of U steps is 8. So, in our five segments, the sum of the lengths of the R segments must be 8, and the same for the U segments.

But since the path alternates between R and U, the number of R segments and U segments must differ by at most one. Because you start with either R or U, and each change alternates the direction. So, with five segments, if we start with R, the number of R segments would be three and U segments would be two, or vice versa.

Wait, let's think. If the path starts with R, then the segments are R,
