Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right without any restrictions usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, the total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for right (or up), which is C(16,8). But this problem is more specific because it's about paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction four times... So, each time you change direction, you switch from moving right to up or vice versa. So, the number of direction changes is related to the number of times you switch between right and up moves.

Let me think. If a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that translate into the number of segments of right and up moves? Let's consider that each time you change direction, you start a new segment. So, if you change direction four times, you must have five segments in total. How?

Because, for example, if you start by moving right, then change direction to up, that's one change. Then change back to right, that's two changes, and so on. So, four changes would mean five segments. Each segment is a consecutive series of right or up moves.

So, the path is divided into five segments, alternating between right and up. Now, since the grid is 8x8, each path must consist of 8 right moves and 8 up moves. Therefore, these five segments must be divided into right and up moves in such a way that the total for each is 8.

But since the path starts at the lower left, which is (0,0), and ends at (8,8), the first move could be either right or up. Let me clarify: do all paths have to start with a right move, or can they start with an up move? Wait, in a grid, any path can choose to move right or up first. So, the starting direction can be either right or up. But in our case, since the grid is symmetric, perhaps the number of paths starting with right and those starting with up would be the same. So, maybe I can compute the number for one case and then double it.

Wait, no. Because when the number of segments is odd or even, the starting direction affects how the segments are alternated. Let's see: if a path has five segments, which is odd, then it must start with one direction, then alternate, ending with the other direction. So, for example, if it starts with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if it starts with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up
