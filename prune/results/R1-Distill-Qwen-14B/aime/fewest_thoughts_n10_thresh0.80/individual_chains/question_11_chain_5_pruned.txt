Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression: 

\[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]

where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be represented in polar form as \( z = re^{i\theta} \), where \( r \) is the modulus (which is given as 4 here) and \( \theta \) is the argument. Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( r = 4 \), so \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \).

Now, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, I can rewrite the expression as:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying each term:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} \)
Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4} (96 + 144i) e^{-i\theta} \)

So, the entire expression becomes:

\[
4(75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i) e^{-i\theta}
\]

Let me compute the coefficients numerically.

First coefficient: \(4(75 + 117i)\)
4 * 75 = 300
4 * 117 = 468
So, that's \(300 + 468i\).

Second coefficient: \( \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i) \)
96 / 4 = 24
144 / 4 = 36
So, that's \(24 + 36i\).

So now the expression is:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

I need to find the real part of this expression. Remember, the real part of a complex number \( a + bi \) is \( a \). So, to find the real part, I can write each term as a sum of real and imaginary parts and then add them together, keeping only the real parts.

Alternatively, since both terms involve \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \), perhaps I can express them in terms of cosine and sine, which might make it easier to find the real part.

I know that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me write each term using this:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Now, I'll expand both terms.

Starting with the first term:
\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Multiply term by term:
= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta
But \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta

Grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
Imaginary: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i

Now the second term:
\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
Multiply term by term:
= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2 \sin\theta
Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta

Grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
Imaginary: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i

Now, adding the two expanded terms together:

Real parts:
(300cosθ - 468sinθ) + (24cosθ + 36sinθ)
= (300 + 24)cosθ + (-468 + 36)sinθ
= 324cosθ - 432sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300sinθ + 468cosθ + (-24sinθ + 36cosθ))i
= (300 -24)sinθ + (468 +36)cosθ
= 276sinθ + 504cosθ

But since we only care about the real part of the entire expression, the imaginary parts can be ignored for the purpose of maximizing the real part. So the real part is:

324cosθ - 432sinθ

So now the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324cosθ - 432sinθ, where θ is a real number (since z can be any complex number on the circle of radius 4).

I remember that an expression of the form \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( C\cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \phi \) is some phase shift. The maximum value of this expression is \( C \), because the maximum of cosine is 1.

Wait, but in our case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which is similar to \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \), but with a negative sign. So, perhaps we can write it as \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) with \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \). Then, the maximum value is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \).

So, let's compute \( C = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Calculating 324^2:

324 * 324: Let's compute step by step.
300^2 = 90000
24^2 = 576
Then, cross term 2*300*24 = 14400
So, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2:

400^2 = 160,000
32^2 = 1,024
Cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600
So, 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 = 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

But since B is -432, B^2 is the same as 432^2, so 186,624.

Now, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600)

What's sqrt(291,600)?

Well, 500^2 = 250,000, 600^2=360,000, so it's between 500 and 600.

540^2 = (500 +40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2 =250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600.

Yes, so sqrt(291,600)=540.

So, the maximum value of 324cosθ -432sinθ is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

Wait, but let me just double-check if I've considered all the steps correctly.

We started by writing z in polar form, substituted it into the expression, expanded both terms, collected real parts, and then recognized the real part as a linear combination of sin and cos. Then, we converted that into an amplitude form, calculated the amplitude which gave us the maximum value.
