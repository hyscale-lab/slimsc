Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant to all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n/p, and then I have to find m + n + p. Hmm, tetrahedrons can be a bit tricky, but let me try to break this down.

First, let me list out the given edge lengths:
- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That's interesting. It seems like the tetrahedron is "isohedral" in some way, but I'm not entirely sure what that implies. Maybe it's a symmetrical tetrahedron, which could help in calculations.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, how do I find the volume of this tetrahedron? Since it's a general tetrahedron, maybe I can use coordinates to model it. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices, I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product or something similar.

Let me try that approach. Let's place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system. I'll place vertex A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, I can place vertex B along the x-axis, so B is at (x, 0, 0). Vertex C can be in the xy-plane, so C is at (a, b, 0). Finally, vertex D will be in 3D space at (c, d, e). 

But with this setup, I need to satisfy all the given edge lengths. Let's write down the distances:

AB = √41 = distance between A(0,0,0) and B(x,0,0). So, AB = √(x²) = x. Therefore, x = √41. So, B is at (√41, 0, 0).

AC = √80 = distance between A(0,0,0) and C(a,b,0). So:

√(a² + b²) = √80 => a² + b² = 80.

AD = √89 = distance between A(0,0,0) and D(c,d,e). So:

√(c² + d² + e²) = √89 => c² + d² + e² = 89.

Similarly, BC = √89 = distance between B(√41, 0, 0) and C(a,b,0). So:

√[(a - √41)² + b²] = √89. Therefore, (a - √41)² + b² = 89.

But we already have a² + b² = 80. Let me subtract these equations to find a.

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(a - √41)² + b² - (a² + b²) = 89 - 80

Expanding (a - √41)²: a² - 2a√41 + 41

So, a² - 2a√41 + 41 + b² - a² - b² = 9

Simplify: -2a√41 + 41 = 9

So, -2a√41 = -32 => 2a√41 = 32 => a = (32)/(2√41) = 16/√41. Rationalizing the denominator: a = (16√41)/41.

Now, substitute a back into a² + b² = 80.

a² = (256 * 41) / (41²) = 256/41.

So, 256/41 + b² = 80 => b² = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 - 256)/41.

Calculate 80*41: 80*40=3200, 80*1=80, so 3280.

3280 - 256 = 3024.

So, b² = 3024/41.

Therefore, b = √(3024/41) = √(3024)/√41. Let's see if 3024 can be simplified.

3024 ÷ 16 = 189. So, √(3024) = √(16*189) = 4√189.

189 = 9*21 = 9*3*7. So, √189 = 3√21. Thus, √3024 = 4*3√21 = 12√21.

So, b = 12√21 / √41. Rationalizing: b = 12√(21*41)/41.

Wait, maybe that's not necessary right now. Let me just note that b = (12√21)/√41. Hmm.

So, point C is at (16√41/41, 12√21/√41, 0).

Now, moving on to point D. It's at (c, d, e) in 3D space.

We know CD = √41, which is the distance between C and D. So:

√[(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + (e - 0)^2] = √41.

So, (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 41.

Also, BD = √80. Point B is at (√41, 0, 0), so distance BD is:

√[(c - √41)^2 + (d - 0)^2 + (e - 0)^2] = √80.

So, (c - √41)^2 + d² + e² = 80.

Similarly, AD is given as √89, which is the distance from A(0,0,0) to D(c,d,e):

√(c² + d² + e²) = √89 => c² + d² + e² = 89.

Hmm, okay, let me write down all three equations:

1. (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 41. [From CD = √41]
2. (c - √41)^2 + d² + e² = 80. [From BD = √80]
3. c² + d² + e² = 89. [From AD = √89]

Let me try to subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

Equation 2: (c - √41)^2 + d² + e² = 80.

Equation 3: c² + d² + e² = 89.

Subtracting 3 - 2: [c² - 2c√41 + 41 + d² + e²] - [c² + d² + e²] = 80 - 89.

Simplify: -2c√41 + 41 = -9.

So, -2c√41 = -50 => 2c√41 = 50 => c = 50/(2√41) = 25/√41. Rationalizing: c = 25√41 / 41.

So, c = 25√41 / 41.

Now, let's substitute c into equation 3: c² + d² + e² = 89.

c² = (625 * 41) / (41²) = 625/41.

So, 625/41 + d² + e² = 89 => d² + e² = 89 - 625/41 = (89*41 - 625)/41.

Calculate 89*41: 80*41=3280, 9*41=369. So, 3280 + 369 = 3649.

3649 - 625 = 3024.

So, d² + e² = 3024 / 41.

Now, let's go back to equation 1: (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 41.

We know c and a, so let's compute (c - a)^2.

c = 25√41 / 41, a =16√41 /41.

c - a = (25√41 -16√41)/41 = 9√41 /41.

So, (c - a)^2 = (81 * 41)/ (41²) = 81/41.

Similarly, (d - b)^2: Let's hold onto that for a moment.

So, equation 1 becomes:

81/41 + (d - b)^2 + e² = 41.

Wait, but from equation 3, we have d² + e² = 3024/41.

So, let me substitute d² + e² = 3024/41 into equation 1.

Equation 1: 81/41 + (d - b)^2 + e² = 41.

But (d - b)^2 = d² - 2bd + b².

Therefore, equation 1 becomes:

81/41 + d² - 2bd + b² + e² = 41.

But d² + e² = 3024 /41, so substituting:

81/41 + (3024/41) - 2bd + b² = 41.

Combine the constants:

(81 + 3024)/41 = 3105/41.

So, 3105/41 - 2bd + b² = 41.

Now, 41 is 41/1, so convert it to 41*41/41 = 1681/41.

So, 3105/41 + b² - 2bd = 1681/41.

Bring 3105/41 to the other side:

b² - 2bd = 1681/41 - 3105/41 = (-1424)/41.

So, b² - 2bd = -1424/41.

We can write this as:

-2bd = -1424/41 - b².

Divide both sides by -2:

bd = (1424/41 + b²)/2.

Hmm, I need to know b and d to solve this. Wait, but I know what b is.

Earlier, I found that b = 12√21 / √41.

Wait, actually, let me check: When I found b, I had:

b² = 3024/41.

Wait, is that correct? Let me re-examine.

Earlier, from a² + b² =80, and a=16√41/41:

a² = (256*41)/(41²) = 256/41.

So, 256/41 + b² =80 => b²=80 - 256/41.

80 is 3280/41, so 3280/41 - 256/41 = 3024/41. Yes, correct. So, b²=3024/41.

So, b=√(3024/41) = √3024 / √41.

As I did before, 3024=16*189=16*9*21=16*9*3*7. So, √3024=4*3*√21=12√21.

So, b=12√21 / √41. Rationalizing, b=12√(21*41)/41.

But perhaps it's better to just keep it as b=12√21 / √41.

So, let's get back to the equation: bd = (1424/41 + b²)/2.

Plugging in b=12√21 / √41, let's compute the numerator:

1424/41 + b² =1424/41 + 3024/41 = (1424 + 3024)/41 = 4448/41.

So, 4448 divided by 41: Let's compute that.

41*108=41*(100+8)=4100 + 328=4428.

4448 -4428=20. So, 4448/41=108 + 20/41=108 +20/41=108.4878...

But perhaps we can keep it as 4448/
