Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let's try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem mentions two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles are right angles. So, ABCD has sides BC=16 and AB=107. That means in rectangle ABCD, the sides AB and CD are 107 units long, and the sides BC and AD are 16 units long. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG=17 and EF=184. So, EF and GH are 184 units, and FG and EH are 17 units.

Next, the problem states that points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means all four points lie on a straight line. So, I can imagine points D and C from rectangle ABCD, and points E and F from rectangle EFGH all lying on the same straight line. 

Also, it's given that points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting because four points lying on a circle means they are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. This might imply that certain properties like cyclic quadrilaterals apply here, which could help in finding lengths or angles.

So, my goal is to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize or maybe sketch a rough diagram in my mind. 

Let me denote the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let's assign coordinates to the points to model this scenario. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (16,0) because DC is 16. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to A is upwards along the y-axis, so A should be at (0,107). Similarly, point B would then be at (16,107).

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, point E and F lie on the line passing through D and C. The line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (16,0). So, E and F must also lie somewhere on the x-axis. Since E is part of rectangle EFGH, it must be either to the left or right of D or C. Similarly, F is another point on this line.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's D, E, C, F that are collinear. So, their order is important. Let's think about the order. It says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, starting from D, going through E, then C, then F. So, the order is D-E-C-F on the line. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Wait, but if E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, but considering the rectangle EFGH, the positions of E and F might be such that EFGH is another rectangle attached in some way.

Wait, but if E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, then EFGH would have E and F on the x-axis, with F at (16 + something, 0). Let me figure out the exact coordinates.

So, let's assign coordinates systematically.

Let me set D at (0,0). Then, since DC is 16, C is at (16,0). AB is 107, so A is at (0,107), and B is at (16,107). Now, since EFGH is another rectangle, and E and F are on the x-axis. 

The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E is between D and C, so E must be somewhere between (0,0) and (16,0). Let me denote
