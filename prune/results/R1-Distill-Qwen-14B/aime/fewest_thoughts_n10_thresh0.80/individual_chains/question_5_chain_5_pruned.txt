Okay, so I have this problem here about a triangle ABC with some circles tangent to its sides. Let me try to understand the setup.

First, there are eight circles, each with radius 34, arranged sequentially tangent. That means each circle is touching the next one in a straight line. Also, two of these circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of the triangle. So, probably these circles are sitting in the corners where AB and BC meet, each touching their respective side and the next circle in the sequence.

Then, the problem mentions that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. I think that means that if we scaled down the configuration by a factor, replacing the big circles with small ones, we'd fit 2024 of them. So, perhaps the inradius of the triangle ABC relates to both the size of the circles and this scaling factor.

The goal is to find the inradius of triangle ABC expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. Let me recall that the inradius (r) of a triangle is related to its area (A) and semi-perimeter (s) by the formula r = A/s. So maybe I can find A and s somehow.

But first, I need to figure out the relationship between the circles and the triangle. The eight circles are sequentially tangent, so their centers form a straight line, each separated by twice the radius, so 68 units apart. Wait, no, if they are tangent, the distance between centers is the sum of their radii, but since they're all the same radius, 34, the distance between centers is 34 + 34 = 68.

So, the centers of the eight circles are spaced 68 units apart, forming a straight line. But two of them are tangent to sides AB and BC. So, triangle ABC must have two sides, AB and BC, each having a circle of radius 34 tangent to them.

Wait, maybe these circles are similar to the incircle or excircle, but given that two circles are tangent to two sides, perhaps they are mixtilinear incircles? Or maybe just regular incircles, but in this case, it's two circles each tangent to two sides.

Wait, but each circle is only tangent to one side. Because the problem says "two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC respectively." So, one circle is tangent to AB, another is tangent to BC, and the rest are just in a line? Hmm, that's a bit unclear.

Wait, let me re-read the problem: "Eight circles of radius 34 are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC of triangle ABC, respectively." So, I think the eight circles are arranged in a straight line, each tangent to the next, and two of them are also tangent to sides AB and BC. So, the first circle in the sequence is tangent to AB, the next seven are just in a chain, and the last circle is tangent to BC. So, in total, the arrangement spans from AB down to BC, with a chain of circles in between.

If that's the case, then the length from AB to BC would be the
