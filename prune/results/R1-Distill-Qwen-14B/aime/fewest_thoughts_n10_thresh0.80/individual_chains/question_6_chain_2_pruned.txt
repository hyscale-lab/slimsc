Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what the functions f and g are. The problem says f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So, both f and g are compositions of absolute value functions. I remember that absolute value functions create V-shapes, and when you have nested absolute values, the graph can become more complex, maybe even piecewise linear with multiple segments.

Let me sketch out f(x) and g(x) to visualize them. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:

- The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with its vertex at (0,0).
- Then subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2 unit. So, the vertex would now be at (0, -1/2). But since we're taking the absolute value again, ||x| - 1/2|, any negative values will be flipped above the x-axis.

So, let's analyze f(x):

- When |x| - 1/2 >= 0, which is when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2.
- When |x| - 1/2 < 0, which is when |x| < 1/2, f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) is a V-shape that has its minimum at x=0, where f(0) = 1/2, and it decreases until |x|=1/2, where it reaches 0, and then increases again beyond that.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|:

- The inner part is |x| - 1/4.
- Taking the absolute value again will reflect any negative parts.

So, let's break it down:

- When |x| - 1/4 >= 0, which is |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.
- When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|.

So, g(x) has its minimum at x=0, where g(0) = 1/4, then it decreases until |x|=1/4, reaching 0, and then increases beyond that.

Alright, so now I have f and g defined. Next, I need to understand the compositions and transformations applied to them.

The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a bit of a chain. Let me parse it step by step:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function with 2πx as its argument will have a period of 1, since the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k. So, sin(2πx) has a period of 1, oscillating between -1 and 1.

2. Apply f to it: f(sin(2πx)). So, f is applied to the sine function's output, which ranges between -1 and 1. Let me think about what f does to this range.

Since f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, let's plug in the sine function's range. The sine function gives values from -1 to 1, so |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1. Then, |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 would range from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value again, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|, so it ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, let me check that. If |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1, subtracting 1/2 gives between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, the output of f(sin(2πx)) is between 0 and 1/2. So, the range of f(sin(2πx)) is [0, 1/2].

Then, g is applied to that: g(f(sin(2πx))). Since g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, and the input here is between 0 and 1/2, let's see what happens.

Let me denote h(x) = f(sin(2πx)) which is in [0, 1/2], then g(h(x)) = ||h(x)| - 1/4|. But since h(x) is non-negative, it's just |h(x) - 1/4|.

So, when h(x) = 0, g(h(x)) = 1/4. When h(x) = 1/4, g(h(x)) = 0. When h(x) is greater than 1/4 (i.e., h(x) > 1/4), g(h(x)) = h(x) - 1/4. When h(x) is less than 1/4, g(h(x)) = 1/4 - h(x).

So, the function g(f(sin(2πx))) will output values between 0 and 1/4.

Then, multiplying by 4: 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) will scale this range. The minimum is 0, and the maximum is 4*(1/4) = 1. So, y ranges from 0 to 1.

Similarly, for the other equation, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let me analyze this one too:

1. Start with cos(3πy). The cosine function has a range of [-1,1], and with 3πy as the argument, its period is 2/(3π) * 2π = 2/3? Wait, no. Wait, the period of cos(k y) is 2π / k. So, here k is 3π, so the period is 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3, oscillating between -1 and 1.

2. Apply f to it: f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. As before, |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, so subtracting 1/2 gives between -1/2 and 1/2, and absolute value makes it [0, 1/2].

3. Then apply g to that result: g(f(cos(3πy))) = ||f(cos(3πy)) - 1/4|. Since f(cos(3πy)) is in [0, 1/2], as before, g(f(cos(3πy))) will be in [0, 1/4].

4. Multiply by 4: 4g(f(cos(3πy))) will scale to [0,1].

So, both equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) have outputs in [0,1]. So, we're looking for points (x,y) where x and y are in [0,1], and where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Wait a minute, but x and y are both in [0,1], right? Because the functions 4g(f(...)) output between 0 and 1. But x and y could be any real numbers, but in this case, since we're dealing with functions that output between 0 and 1, the intersections would occur within this square [0,1]
