Okay, so I'm trying to solve this game problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how these types of games usually work. It reminds me of the classic Nim game, but with specific move options. Maybe I can model this using the concept of winning and losing positions.

A winning position is when the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is when no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the key is to figure out for each n, whether it's a winning or losing position. If n is a losing position, then Bob can win if he's the second player because Alice would be forced into a losing position on her first move.

Let's start by analyzing small n and see if we can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for the first player.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob then takes the last one and wins. Or, could Alice take 4? No, because there are only 2 tokens. So Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who can win. Wait, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which means Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player.

Wait, no. Wait, let me re-examine that. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So if Alice leaves n=1, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So for n=2, the second player can win. Hence, n=2 is a losing position for the first player.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving n=2. From our previous analysis, n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So Bob would be in a losing position if Alice leaves him with n=2. So Alice can force Bob into a losing position, meaning n=3 is a winning position for Alice.

Wait, so n=3 is a winning position for the first player.

n=4: Alice can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So n=4 is a winning position.

n=5: Alice can take 1 token, leaving n=4. Then Bob can take 4 and win. Alternatively, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving n=1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob as the second player.

Wait, so n=5: Bob can win, so it's a losing position for the first player.

Wait, let me make a table
