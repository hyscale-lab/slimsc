Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The probability is expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The probability we need is the probability of the grand prize (all four numbers matching) given that she has at least two numbers matching. So, in probability terms, it's P(grand prize) / P(prize), because the conditional probability P(A|B) is equal to P(A âˆ© B)/P(B), but since A is a subset of B (if she wins the grand prize, she definitely won a prize), it's just P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute two things: the probability that she wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize (at least two numbers matching). Then, I'll divide them to get the conditional probability.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways 4 numbers can be chosen from S. Since S has 10 elements, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). I can compute that as 10!/(4!6!) = 210. So, total possible lottery draws are 210.

Now, let's compute the probability of the grand prize. That would be the probability that all four numbers Jen picked are the ones chosen. Since she picked 4 specific numbers, there's only one favorable outcome. So, P(grand prize) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find the probability that Jen wins a prize. Winning a prize means she has at least two numbers matching. So, that includes the cases where she has exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers matching. But wait, since the grand prize is already considered when all four match, maybe I should handle that separately, but in this case, since we're computing P(prize), it includes all those possibilities except for maybe none or one matching.

Wait, actually, the prize is given if at least two numbers match. So, P(prize) is the probability that two, three, or four numbers match. So, to compute this, I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes for exactly two matches, exactly three matches, and exactly four matches, sum them up, and then divide by the total number of possible combinations, which is 210.

Alternatively, it might be easier to compute the probability of NOT winning a prize (i.e., having 0 or 1 matches) and subtract that from 1. But maybe that's more complicated. Let's try both ways.

First, let's compute the number of ways she can have exactly k matches, where k is 2, 3, or 4.

When k=4, it's the grand prize case. There's exactly 1 way.

When k=3, she has 3 numbers matching and 1 not matching. So, how many ways can this happen? She's choosing 3 numbers from her 4, and 1 number from the remaining 6 numbers in S (since S has 10, and she picked 4). So, the number of ways is C(4,3) * C(6,1). That's 4 * 6 = 24.

Similarly, when k=2, she has exactly 2 numbers matching and 2
