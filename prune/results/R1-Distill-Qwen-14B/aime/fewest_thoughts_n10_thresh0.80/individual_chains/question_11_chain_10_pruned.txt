Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then z can be written as r times e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Since |z| is 4 here, z = 4e^{iθ}. That might come in handy later.

The expression I need to maximize the real part of is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me write that down more clearly:

E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since |z| = 4, 1/z is (1/z) = (1/(4e^{iθ})) = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, 1/z is just the conjugate of z divided by |z|^2, but maybe using exponentials is easier here.

Let me substitute z as 4e^{iθ} into the expression E. Then, 1/z becomes (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, E becomes:

E = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately. First, (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Calculating (75 + 117i) * 4: 75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468. So that's 300 + 468i. So, the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) = 24 + 36i. So, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can rewrite it in terms of sine and cosine to separate real and imaginary parts.

Alternatively, I can express each term as a complex number multiplied by e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}, then expand them using Euler's formula.

Euler's formula says e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's expand each term:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Multiplying this out:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Expanding this:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

Now, adding both terms together for E:

E = [ (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) ] + [ (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) ] i.

Simplify the real part:

Real part: 300 cosθ + 24 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 36 sinθ.

= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

= (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ.

= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So, E is equal to (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ).

But we are interested in the real part of E, which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Let me denote Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of Re(E) as θ varies.

So, Re(E) is a linear combination of cosθ and sinθ. I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²) and tanφ = b/a (or something like that). Wait, actually, it's R cos(θ - φ), but the exact form depends on the coefficients.

Wait, more precisely, a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²), and φ = arctan(b/a) if a ≠ 0. Or sometimes it's written as R sin(θ + φ)... Hmm, I need to get that right.

Wait, let's recall: a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²), and φ = arctan(b/a). Alternatively, it can also be written as R sin(θ + φ'), depending on the phase shift.

Wait, let me check with a simple example. If a = 1, b = 1, then 1 cosθ +1 sinθ = sqrt(2) cos(θ - 45°), since cos(θ - 45°) = cosθ cos45 + sinθ sin45, which is (cosθ + sinθ)/sqrt(2
