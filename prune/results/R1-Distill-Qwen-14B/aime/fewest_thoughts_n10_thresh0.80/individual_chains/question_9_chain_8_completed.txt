Okay, so I've got this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me write down the two equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I'll start with the first one. So, log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a), I can bring the exponent x in front. That would make it x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, no, let me think. Actually, the exponent is already x, so applying the power rule gives me log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10. So that equation is x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, okay.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same power rule, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, both equations equal 10, so maybe I can set them equal to each other or find a relationship between them. Also, I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are related. I remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A, then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So, substituting that into the equations:

1. x * A = 10
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

So now I have two equations with x, y, and A. Maybe I can solve one equation for a variable and substitute into the other.

From equation 1: x = 10 / A.

From equation 2: 4y / A = 10, so 4y = 10A, which implies y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2.

Now I have x and y in terms of A. Maybe I can relate x and y through another equation, perhaps using the fact that log_x(y) = A.

Wait, let's see. Since log_x(y) = A, that means y = x^A. Because if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c.

So, from that, y = x^A.

But I also have expressions for x and y in terms of A.

From equation 1: x = 10 / A.

And from equation 2: y = (5A)/2.

Since y = x^A, substituting x and y:

(5A)/2 = (10/A)^A.

Hmm, that's an equation involving A. This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can find A by testing some integer values or see if A is a nice number.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take logarithms on both sides to simplify this. Let me try taking the natural logarithm of both sides.

ln[(5A)/2] = A * ln(10/A).

Wait, but that might not directly help. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe I can express both sides in terms of exponents and see if I can find a value for A. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can express A in terms of x or y. Let me see.

Wait, since log_x(y) = A, which implies y = x^A, and we also have y = (5A)/2 from equation 2.

So, x^A = (5A)/2.

But from equation 1, x = 10 / A. So substituting x into x^A:

(10/A)^A = (5A)/2.

Hmm. Maybe I can write this as (10/A)^A = (5A)/2.

This equation looks a bit daunting, but perhaps I can find a value for A that satisfies it.

Let me try plugging in some integer values for A. Let's see.

First, let's try A=2.

Left side: (10/2)^2 = 5^2 =25.

Right side: (5*2)/2 = 10/2 =5.

25 ≠5, so A=2 doesn't work.

How about A=3?

Left side: (10/3)^3 ≈ (3.333)^3 ≈ 37.037.

Right side: (5*3)/2 = 15/2 =7.5.

Not equal.

A=1?

Left: (10/1)^1=10.

Right: (5*1)/2=2.5.

Nope.

A=4?

Left: (10/4)^4 = (2.5)^4 = 39.0625.

Right: (5*4)/2=10.

Nope, not equal.

Hmm, maybe A is a fraction. Let's try A=5.

Left: (10/5)^5=2^5=32.

Right: (5*5)/2=25/2=12.5. Not equal.

A=5: 32 vs 12.5. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe A=10?

Wait, A=10 would make x=10/10=1, but x has to be greater than 1, so no.

Wait, maybe A= something else.

Wait, perhaps A= something like 5/2=2.5?

Let me try A=2.5.

Left side: (10/2.5)^(2.5) = 4^2.5 = 4^(2 + 0.5) = 4^2 * sqrt(4) = 16 * 2 =32.

Right side: (5*2.5)/2 = 12.5/2=6.25.

32 ≠6.25. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A= something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take log on both sides of (10/A)^A = (5A)/2.

Let me take ln of both sides:

A * ln(10/A) = ln( (5A)/2 )

So, A * ( ln(10) - ln(A) ) = ln(5A/2)

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps try to express it as:

(10/A)^A = (5A)/2.

Let me write (10/A) as (10/A) = 10/A.

Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, cross-multiplied:

2*(10/A)^A =5A.

Hmm, but I don't see an obvious way to solve this algebraically. Maybe I can assume that A is an integer, but that didn't work for A=2,3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps A is 10? Let me try A=10, but as I thought before, x would be 10/10=1, which is invalid because x must be greater than 1.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can take natural logs as I did before and see if I can find a substitution.

So, equation: A ( ln(10) - ln(A) ) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

Because ln(5A/2) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

So, let me write that as:

A ( ln(10) - ln(A) ) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

Bring all terms to left side:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) - ln(5) - ln(A) + ln(2) = 0.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can factor some terms.

Let me group terms with ln(A):

= A ln(10) - (A +1) ln(A) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution, let me set t = ln(A). Then A = e^t.

Wait, substituting:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

So:

A ln(10) = A ln(A) + ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

Hmm, maybe I can factor A:

A [ ln(10) - ln(A) ] = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

But this is the same as before.

Wait, maybe I can try to find an approximate value for A numerically.

I can use trial and error or maybe Newton-Raphson method.

Let me try to see the behavior of the function f(A) = A (ln(10) - ln(A)) - [ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)].

We can evaluate f(A) for various A and see where it crosses zero.

We know A must be positive and greater than 0, but since x and y are greater than 1, and from equation 1, x =10/A, so A must be less than 10 (since x >1, so 10/A >1 implies A <10).

Similarly, from equation 2, y=5A/2 >1, so A> 2/5=0.4.

So A is between 0.4 and 10.

Let me try A=1. Let's compute f(1):

f(1) = 1*(ln(10) - ln(1)) - [ln(5) + ln(1) - ln(2)] = ln(10) - [ln(5) - ln(2)].

Compute numerically:

ln(10) ≈2.302585

ln(5) ≈1.609437

ln(2)≈0.693147

So f(1)=2.302585 - (1.609437 -0.693147)=2.302585 -0.91629=1.386295>0.

So f(1)=1.386>0.

Try A=2:

f(2)=2*(ln(10)-ln(2)) - [ln(5)+ln(2)-ln(2)].

Wait, ln(5)+ln(2)-ln(2)=ln(5).

So f(2)=2*(ln(10)-ln(2)) - ln(5).

Compute:

ln(10)=2.302585, ln(2)=0.693147, ln(5)=1.609437.

So 2*(2.302585 -0.693147)=2*(1.609438)=3.218876.

Subtract ln(5)=1.609437: 3.218876 -1.609437≈1.609439>0.

f(2)=1.609>0.

Hmm, still positive.

Try A=3:

f(3)=3*(ln(10)-ln(3)) - [ln(5)+ln(3)-ln(2)].

Compute ln(3)≈1.098612.

So 3*(2.302585 -1.098612)=3*(1.203973)=3.611919.

Then [ln(5)+ln(3)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.098612 -0.693147≈1.609437+1.098612=2.708049 -0.693147≈2.014902.

So f(3)=3.611919 -2.014902≈1.597017>0.

Still positive. Hmm.

Try A=4:

f(4)=4*(ln(10)-ln(4)) - [ln(5)+ln(4)-ln(2)].

ln(4)=2*ln(2)=1.386294.

So 4*(2.302585 -1.386294)=4*(0.916291)=3.665164.

Then [ln(5)+ln(4)-ln(2)]=1.609437 +1.386294 -0.693147≈1.609437+1.386294=3.0 -0.693147≈2.306853.

So f(4)=3.665164 -2.306853≈1.358311>0. Still positive.

A=5:

f(5)=5*(ln(10)-ln(5)) - [ln(5)+ln(5)-ln(2)].

ln(5)=1.609437.

So 5*(2.302585 -1.609437)=5*(0.693148)=3.46574.

Then [ln(5)+ln(5)-ln(2)] =2*1.609437 -0.693147≈3.218874 -0.693147≈2.525727.

f(5)=3.46574 -2.525727≈0.940013>0.

Still positive.

A=6:

f(6)=6*(ln(10)-ln(6)) - [ln(5)+ln(6)-ln(2)].

ln(6)=ln(2)+ln(3)=0.693147 +1.098612≈1.791759.

So 6*(2.302585 -1.791759)=6*(0.510826)=3.064956.

Then [ln(5)+ln(6)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.791759 -0.693147≈(1.609437+1.791759)=3.401196 -0.693147≈2.708049.

So f(6)=3.064956 -2.708049≈0.356907>0.

Still positive, but getting smaller.

A=7:

f(7)=7*(ln(10)-ln(7)) - [ln(5)+ln(7)-ln(2)].

ln(7)=1.945910.

So 7*(2.302585 -1.945910)=7*(0.356675)=2.496725.

Then [ln(5)+ln(7)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.945910 -0.693147≈(1.609437+1.945910)=3.555347 -0.693147≈2.8622.

So f(7)=2.496725 -2.8622≈-0.365475<0.

So f(7) is negative.

So between A=6 and A=7, f(A) goes from positive to negative, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a root somewhere between 6 and 7.

Wait, but let's check A=6.5.

f(6.5)=6.5*(ln(10)-ln(6.5)) - [ln(5)+ln(6.5)-ln(2)].

Compute ln(6.5)=ln(6.5)= approx?

Well, ln(6)=1.791759, ln(7)=1.945910.

So ln(6.5) is around (let me compute 6.5):

Compute ln(6.5) ≈1.871798.

So 6.5*(2.302585 -1.871798)=6.5*(0.430787)=approx 6.5 *0.430787≈2.7501155.

Then [ln(5) + ln(6.5) - ln(2)]=1.609437 +1.871798 -0.693147≈(1.609437+1.871798)=3.481235 -0.693147≈2.788088.

So f(6.5)=2.7501155 -2.788088≈-0.0379725<0.

So f(6.5) is approximately -0.038, which is negative.

So between A=6 and A=6.5, f(A) goes from positive to negative.

Now let's try A=6.25.

f(6.25)=6.25*(ln(10) - ln(6.25)) - [ln(5)+ln(6.25)-ln(2)].

Compute ln(6.25)= ln(25/4)=ln(25)-ln(4)=3.218876 -1.386294≈1.832582.

So 6.25*(2.302585 -1.832582)=6.25*(0.470003)=approx 6.25*0.470003≈2.937519.

Then [ln(5)+ln(6.25)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.832582 -0.693147≈(1.609437+1.832582)=3.442019 -0.693147≈2.748872.

So f(6.25)=2.937519 -2.748872≈0.188647>0.

So f(6.25)=0.1886>0.

So between A=6.25 and A=6.5, f(A) crosses zero.

Let me try A=6.375 (midpoint between 6.25 and 6.5).

Compute ln(6.375). Hmm, 6.375= 51/8, but maybe approximate. Let's see, ln(6)=1.791759, ln(6.375) is about... Let me compute 6.375.

Alternatively, I can compute ln(6.375) as ln(6)+ln(1.0625). Because 6.375=6*(1+0.0625). So ln(6.375)= ln(6) + ln(1.0625).

ln(1.0625)≈0.060625 (since ln(1+x)≈x -x^2/2 +x^3/3... for small x. Here x=0.0625, so ln(1.0625)≈0.0625 - (0.0625^2)/2 + ... ≈0.0625 -0.001953≈0.060547. So ln(6.375)≈1.791759 +0.060547≈1.852306.

So f(6.375)=6.375*(2.302585 -1.852306) - [ln(5)+ln(6.375)-ln(2)].

Compute the first part: 6.375*(0.450279)≈6.375*0.450279≈approx 6 *0.45=2.7, plus 0.375*0.45≈0.16875, so total≈2.86875.

Wait, more accurately:

0.450279 *6.375:

Compute 6*0.450279=2.701674

0.375*0.450279≈0.375*0.45=0.16875, plus 0.375*0.000279≈0.000104, so total≈0.16875+0.000104≈0.168854.

So total≈2.701674 +0.168854≈2.870528.

Now compute the second part: [ln(5)+ln(6.375)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.852306 -0.693147.

1.609437 +1.852306=3.461743 -0.693147=2.768596.

So f(6.375)=2.870528 -2.768596≈0.101932>0.

Still positive. So between A=6.375 and A=6.5, f(A) goes from positive to negative.

Now let me try A=6.4375.

Compute ln(6.4375). Let me compute this as follows: 6.4375=6 + 0.4375=6 +7/16.

Alternatively, using ln(6.4375)= ln(6.4) + a small delta.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute using a calculator approximation.

But perhaps I can proceed numerically.

Let me try A=6.4375.

ln(6.4375)= let's see, 6.4375 is e^1.862?

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as:

ln(6.4375)= ln(6.4) + ln(1 + 0.0375/6.4). Since 6.4375=6.4*(1 + 0.0375/6.4)=6.4*(1 + 0.005859375).

So ln(6.4375)= ln(6.4) + ln(1.005859375).

Compute ln(6.4)= approx 1.856849.

ln(1.005859375)= approx using expansion: 0.005859375 - (0.005859375)^2/2 + ...≈0.005859375 - 0.00001697≈0.0058424.

So ln(6.4375)≈1.856849 +0.0058424≈1.862691.

Now, compute f(6.4375):

First part: 6.4375*(2.302585 -1.862691)=6.4375*(0.439894).

Calculate 6 *0.439894=2.639364, 0.4375*0.439894≈0.4375*0.4=0.175, 0.4375*0.039894≈0.017435. So total≈0.175+0.017435≈0.192435. So total first part≈2.639364 +0.192435≈2.8318.

Second part: [ln(5)+ln(6.4375)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.862691 -0.693147.

1.609437 +1.862691=3.472128 -0.693147=2.778981.

So f(6.4375)=2.8318 -2.778981≈0.052819>0.

Still positive. Hmm.

Now let's try A=6.46875 (midpoint between 6.4375 and 6.5).

Compute ln(6.46875). Let's compute it as ln(6.46875)= ln(6.4) + ln(1.0078125).

Wait, 6.46875=6.4*(1 + 0.078125/6.4)=6.4*(1+0.01220703125). So, ln(6.46875)= ln(6.4) + ln(1.01220703125).

ln(6.4)=1.856849.

ln(1.01220703125)≈0.01215 (using expansion: ln(1+x)≈x -x^2/2).

So, approx 0.01220703125 - (0.012207)^2 /2≈0.012207 -0.000077≈0.01213.

So ln(6.46875)=approx 1.856849 +0.01213≈1.86898.

Now compute f(6.46875):

First part:6.46875*(2.302585 -1.86898)=6.46875*(0.433605).

Compute 6*0.433605=2.60163, 0.46875*0.433605≈0.46875*0.4=0.1875, 0.46875*0.033605≈0.015759.

So total≈0.1875 +0.015759≈0.203259.

Total first part≈2.60163 +0.203259≈2.804889.

Second part: [ln(5)+ln(6.46875)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.86898 -0.693147.

1.609437 +1.86898≈3.478417 -0.693147≈2.78527.

So f(6.46875)=2.804889 -2.78527≈0.019619>0.

Still positive.

Now, try A=6.484375 (midpoint between 6.46875 and 6.5).

Compute ln(6.484375). Let's compute this as ln(6.484375)= ln(6.4) + ln(1.01625).

Wait, 6.484375=6.4*(1 + 0.01625). So ln(6.484375)=ln(6.4) + ln(1.01625).

ln(1.01625)≈0.01612 (using expansion: 0.01625 - (0.01625)^2/2≈0.01625 -0.000131≈0.016119.

So ln(6.484375)=1.856849 +0.016119≈1.872968.

Now compute f(6.484375):

First part:6.484375*(2.302585 -1.872968)=6.484375*(0.429617).

Calculate 6*0.429617=2.577702.

0.484375*0.429617≈0.484375*0.4=0.19375, 0.484375*0.029617≈approx 0.01426.

Total≈0.19375+0.01426≈0.20801.

Total first part≈2.577702 +0.20801≈2.785712.

Second part: [ln(5)+ln(6.484375)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.872968 -0.693147.

1.609437 +1.872968≈3.482405 -0.693147≈2.789258.

So f(6.484375)=2.785712 -2.789258≈-0.003546<0.

So f(6.484375)≈-0.003546, which is just below zero.

So now, the root lies between A=6.46875 and A=6.484375, since f(6.46875)=0.0196>0, and f(6.484375)=-0.003546<0.

Let me try A=6.478515625 (midpoint between 6.46875 and 6.484375).

Compute ln(6.478515625). Let's compute this as ln(6.478515625)= ln(6.4) + ln(1.01220703125).

Wait, 6.478515625=6.4*(1 + 0.078125/6.4)=6.4*(1+0.01220703125). So ln(6.478515625)=ln(6.4) + ln(1.01220703125).

ln(1.01220703125)≈approx 0.01215 as before.

So ln(6.478515625)≈1.856849 +0.01215≈1.868999.

Now compute f(6.478515625):

First part:6.478515625*(2.302585 -1.868999)=6.478515625*(0.433586).

Calculate 6*0.433586≈2.601516.

0.478515625*0.433586≈approx 0.478515625*0.4=0.19140625, and 0.478515625*0.033586≈approx 0.016084.

Total≈0.19140625 +0.016084≈0.20749.

Total first part≈2.601516 +0.20749≈2.809006.

Second part: [ln(5)+ln(6.478515625)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.868999 -0.693147.

1.609437 +1.868999≈3.478436 -0.693147≈2.785289.

So f(6.478515625)=2.809006 -2.785289≈0.023717>0.

Hmm, positive again. So the root is between 6.478515625 and 6.484375, where f(A) goes from +0.0237 to -0.0035.

Let me try A=6.4814453125 (midpoint between 6.478515625 and 6.484375).

Compute ln(6.4814453125). Let me compute this as ln(6.4814453125)= ln(6.4) + ln(1.012734375).

Because 6.4814453125=6.4*(1 + 0.012734375).

ln(1.012734375)≈0.01265.

So ln(6.4814453125)≈1.856849 +0.01265≈1.8695.

Now compute f(6.4814453125):

First part:6.4814453125*(2.302585 -1.8695)=6.4814453125*(0.433085).

Compute 6*0.433085≈2.59851.

0.4814453125*0.433085≈approx 0.481445*0.4=0.192578, 0.481445*0.033085≈approx 0.01595.

Total≈0.192578+0.01595≈0.208528.

Total first part≈2.59851 +0.208528≈2.807038.

Second part: [ln(5)+ln(6.4814453125)-ln(2)] =1.609437 +1.8695 -0.693147.

1.609437 +1.8695≈3.478937 -0.693147≈2.78579.

So f(6.4814453125)=2.807038 -2.78579≈0.021248>0.

Still positive. Hmm, maybe I need to take more iterations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that A is approximately 6.48 and proceed.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, let me go back to the original equations.

We have:

Equation 1: x log_x(y) =10.

Equation 2:4y log_y(x) =10.

Let me note that log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), as I did before.

Let me denote log_y(x) as k. Then log_x(y) =1/k.

So equation 1 becomes: x*(1/k)=10.

Equation 2 becomes:4y*k=10.

So from equation 1: x =10k.

From equation 2:4y k=10 → y=10/(4k)=5/(2k).

Now, since log_y(x)=k, that implies x = y^k.

So substituting x=10k and y=5/(2k), we get:

10k = [5/(2k)]^k.

So, 10k = (5/(2k))^k.

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of k.

Let me write this as:

10k = (5/(2k))^k.

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(10k) = k * ln(5/(2k)).

Simplify RHS: k*(ln5 - ln(2k))=k*(ln5 - ln2 - lnk).

So, equation becomes:

ln(10k) =k*(ln5 - ln2 - lnk).

Let me expand ln(10k) as ln10 + lnk.

So:

ln10 + lnk =k*(ln5 - ln2 - lnk).

Hmm, let me bring all terms to one side:

ln10 + lnk -k*(ln5 - ln2 - lnk)=0.

Alternatively, factor:

ln10 + lnk - k ln5 +k ln2 +k lnk=0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps we can rearrange terms:

ln10 + lnk +k ln2 =k ln5 -k lnk.

Hmm, not obviously helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me set t=lnk.

Then k= e^t.

So equation becomes:

ln10 + t +k ln2 =k ln5 -k t.

Hmm, but k= e^t, so substituting:

ln10 + t + e^t * ln2 = e^t * ln5 - e^t * t.

Hmm, that's a complicated equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as:

ln10 + lnk =k*(ln5 - ln2 - lnk).

Wait, let me try plugging in k=2.

Then left side: ln10 + ln2≈2.302585 +0.693147≈3.0.

Right side:2*(ln5 - ln2 - ln2)=2*(1.609437 -0.693147 -0.693147)=2*(1.609437 -1.386294)=2*(0.223143)=0.446286.

Nope, not equal.

k=1: left side: ln10 +0≈2.302585.

Right side:1*(ln5 - ln2 -0)=ln5 - ln2≈1.609437 -0.693147≈0.91629.

Not equal.

k=3:

Left: ln10 + ln3≈2.302585 +1.098612≈3.401197.

Right:3*(ln5 - ln2 - ln3)=3*(1.609437 -0.693147 -1.098612)=3*(1.609437 -1.791759)=3*(-0.182322)= -0.546966.

Nope.

k=0.5:

Left: ln10 + ln0.5≈2.302585 -0.693147≈1.609438.

Right:0.5*(ln5 - ln2 - ln0.5)=0.5*(1.609437 -0.693147 - (-0.693147))=0.5*(1.609437 -0.693147 +0.693147)=0.5*(1.609437)=0.8047185.

Not equal.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't getting me anywhere. Maybe I should try to find an approximate value for k numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the equation 10k = (5/(2k))^k.

Let me try plugging in k=2:

10*2=20. (5/(2*2))^2=(5/4)^2=25/16≈1.5625. 20≠1.5625.

k=1:

10*1=10. (5/(2*1))^1=5/2=2.5. 10≠2.5.

k=3:

10*3=30. (5/(2*3))^3=(5/6)^3≈0.137174. 30≠0.137.

k=4:

10*4=40. (5/8)^4≈ (0.625)^4≈0.152588. 40≠0.152.

k=0.5:

10*0.5=5. (5/(2*0.5))^0.5=(5/1)^0.5=√5≈2.236. 5≠2.236.

k=5:

10*5=50. (5/(2*5))^5=(5/10)^5=(0.5)^5=0.03125. 50≠0.03125.

Hmm, perhaps k is between 0.5 and 1.

Wait, when k=0.5: 5≈2.236, which is less than 5.

Wait, wait, but 10k=5, and (5/(2k))^k≈2.236. So 5≈2.236? No, not equal.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the equation wrong. Wait, the equation is 10k = (5/(2k))^k.

Wait, when k=0.5: 10*0.5=5, and (5/(2*0.5))^0.5=(5/1)^0.5=√5≈2.236. So 5≈2.236? No.

Alternatively, perhaps k= something else.

Wait, maybe k=0.25:

10*0.25=2.5.

(5/(2*0.25))^0.25=(5/0.5)^0.25=10^0.25≈1.778.

So 2.5≈1.778? No.

k=0.75:

10*0.75=7.5.

(5/(2*0.75))^0.75=(5/(1.5))^0.75≈(3.3333)^0.75≈approx e^{0.75*ln(3.3333)}.

ln(3.3333)≈1.20397.

So 0.75*1.20397≈0.90298.

e^0.90298≈2.466.

So 7.5≈2.466? No.

Hmm, perhaps k is between 0.5 and 1.

Wait, when k=0.6:

10*0.6=6.

(5/(2*0.6))^0.6=(5/1.2)^0.6≈(4.1667)^0.6≈approx?

Compute ln(4.1667)=1.427.

0.6*1.427≈0.8562.

e^0.8562≈2.356.

So 6≈2.356? No.

k=0.4:

10*0.4=4.

(5/(2*0.4))^0.4=(5/0.8)^0.4=(6.25)^0.4≈approx?

ln(6.25)=1.83258.

0.4*1.83258≈0.733.

e^0.733≈2.08.

So 4≈2.08? No.

Hmm, this trial and error might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that A is approximately 6.48, as I found earlier.

Wait, but earlier when I tried A=6.48, the function f(A) was crossing zero.

But perhaps instead of continuing with the numerical methods, I can accept that A is approximately 6.48, and then find x and y from there.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Let me try another angle.

From equation 1: x * log_x(y) =10.

Which implies log_x(y) =10/x.

But log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x)=10/x.

Similarly, equation 2:4y*log_y(x) =10 → log_y(x)=10/(4y).

But log_y(x) = ln(x)/ln(y)=10/(4y).

So, we have two equations:

1. ln(y)/ln(x) = 10/x → equation (a)
2. ln(x)/ln(y) = 10/(4y) → equation (b)

Notice that equation (a): ln(y)/ln(x) =10/x.

Equation (b): ln(x)/ln(y)=10/(4y).

Multiplying equation (a) and equation (b):

(ln(y)/ln(x)) * (ln(x)/ln(y)) )= (10/x)*(10/(4y)).

Simplify left side: 1.

Right side: (100)/(4xy)=25/(xy).

So, 1=25/(xy) → xy=25.

Wait, that's a much simpler approach! I should have thought of that earlier.

So, by multiplying the two equations, I get 1=25/(xy), so xy=25.

Wow, that's much easier. I was overcomplicating it before.

So, the product xy is 25.


To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

Using the logarithm power rule, we rewrite these as:

1. \(x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10\)
2. \(4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10\)

Let \(A = \log_x(y)\). Then, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{A}\), since \(\log_b(a) = \frac{1}{\log_a(b)}\). Substituting these into the equations, we get:

1. \(x \cdot A = 10 \implies x = \frac{10}{A}\)
2. \(4y \cdot \frac{1}{A} = 10 \implies y = \frac{5A}{2}\)

From the definition of logarithms, \(y = x^A\). Substituting \(x = \frac{10}{A}\) into this, we get:

\[
\frac{5A}{2} = \left(\frac{10}{A}\right)^A
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{5A}{2}\right) = A \cdot \ln\left(\frac{10}{A}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln(5) + \ln(A) - \ln(2) = A \cdot (\ln(10) - \ln(A))
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\ln(10) + \ln(A) = A \cdot (\ln(5) - \ln(2) - \ln(A))
\]

To solve this equation numerically, we find that \(A \approx 6.48\). Substituting \(A\) back into the expressions for \(x\) and \(y\):

\[
x = \frac{10}{6.48} \approx 1.543
\]
\[
y = \frac{5 \cdot 6.48}{2} \approx 16.2
\]

Finally, multiplying \(x\) and \(y\):

\[
xy \approx 1.543 \cdot 16.2 = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
