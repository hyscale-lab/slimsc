Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC² where C is a specific point on segment AB. Hmm, let me try to parse the problem step by step.

First, the points given are O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis, a bit higher up since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. 

Next, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p and q positive, and the length of PQ is 1. Since it's in the first quadrant, both p and q must be positive.

I remember that the distance between two points (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²). So, for PQ to be of unit length, we have sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which implies p² + q² = 1. Therefore, each segment PQ is a hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs p and q, and hypotenuse 1. 

So, the family F is all such segments PQ where p and q are positive real numbers satisfying p² + q² = 1. That makes sense. So, F is a set of line segments from the x-axis to the y-axis, each of length 1.

Now, the next part says that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, C is on AB, and it's not on any other segment PQ from the family F except AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Let's check: A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the length of AB to confirm.

The length of AB is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a segment of length 1, so it belongs to the family F. 

Therefore, AB is one of these segments PQ, with P=A and Q=B. So, the point C is on AB, and it's not on any other PQ in F except for AB itself. So, for all other segments PQ in F, point C is not on them. 

The problem is asking for OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, OC² is equal to p/q, where p and q are coprime positive integers, and we need to find p + q.

So, my goal is to find point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment from F except AB. Then, compute OC².

Let me try to visualize this. The family F consists of all segments PQ from the x-axis to the y-axis of length 1. So, each such segment is a line connecting (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² = 1. So, these are lines with equation x/p + y/q = 1, since they intercept the x-axis at p and y-axis at q.

The set of all such lines for p² + q² =1 would form a sort of envelope or boundary. The point C is the point on AB that is not on any other such line except AB itself. So, it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of these lines.

Wait, is that correct? If a point is on AB and not on any other PQ in F, that suggests that AB is the only such segment passing through C. So, C is the point where AB is the only segment in F passing through it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is the only PQ in F that contains C. So, for all other PQ in F, C is not on them. So, maybe the envelope of F touches AB at point C, making it a unique intersection point.

So, perhaps I should find the envelope of the family F and find its intersection with AB.

To find the envelope, I can use calculus. The envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system of equations given by the family and its derivative with respect to the parameter.

But first, I need to parameterize the family F. Since each segment PQ has endpoints (p,0) and (0,q) with p² + q² =1, I can let p be a parameter, then q would be sqrt(1 - p²), since p and q are positive.

Therefore, the equation of each line PQ is x/p + y/q =1, which is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1.

So, the family is parameterized by p, where p is in (0,1). So, for each p in (0,1), we have a line L_p: x/p + y
