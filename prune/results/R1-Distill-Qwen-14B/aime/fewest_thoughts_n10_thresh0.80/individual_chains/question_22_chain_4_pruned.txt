Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, the problem says it's a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, that means AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Since it's equilateral, all the sides are equal in length. But the problem asks for the side length, so I need to figure out how to find that.

Then, there's a triangle mentioned. This triangle is formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. My goal is to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm. I remember that in such problems, similar triangles often come into play, especially when dealing with parallel sides and extensions. Since AB, CD, and EF are all extended to form a triangle, maybe I can relate the triangle's sides to the hexagon's sides using similarity or some proportion.

Let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's kind of like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or skewed. But since all sides are equal, it's equilateral but not necessarily regular. The opposite sides being parallel suggests that it's a special type of hexagon, perhaps a "centrosymmetric" one, meaning it has a center of symmetry.

Wait, convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. That might be a type of hexagon where each pair of opposite sides is not only parallel but also equal in length. But since it's equilateral, all sides are equal. So, all pairs of opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, AB = CD = EF = BC = DE = FA. Wait, no, that can't be because in a regular hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is parallel, but in this case, since it's equilateral but not necessarily regular. Hmm, maybe all sides are equal, but opposite sides are parallel. So, it's an equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, for example, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA, but the angles can be different.

So, how does extending AB, CD, and EF form a triangle? Let me think. If I extend AB, CD, and EF until they meet, each pair of these extended lines will form the sides of a triangle. So, the triangle is formed by these three extensions.

Now, let me denote the triangle as XYZ, with sides opposite to vertices X, Y, Z being 200, 240, and 300 respectively. Wait, but actually, the triangle's side lengths are given as 200, 240, and 300. So, triangle XYZ has sides XY = 200, YZ = 240, and XZ = 300. Or maybe they are in a different order. Not sure yet.

But how do the sides of the triangle relate to the hexagon? Since the hexagon's sides are extensions of AB, CD, EF to form the triangle, and the hexagon is convex,
