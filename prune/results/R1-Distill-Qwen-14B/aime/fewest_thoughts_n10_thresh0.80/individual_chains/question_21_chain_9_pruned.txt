Okay, so I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

For example, they gave 81 as a 13-eautiful number because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, I need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions. 

Let me try to break down the problem.

First, let's consider how a two-digit number in base b is structured. A two-digit number in base b is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero, right? So d1 must be at least 1. Also, in any base b, the digits d1 and d0 must satisfy 0 ≤ d0, d1 < b.

So, the number n can be written as n = d1 * b + d0, where 1 ≤ d1 < b and 0 ≤ d0 < b.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, d1 + d0, equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = d1 + d0. Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

n = (d1 + d0)^2.

But n is also equal to d1 * b + d0. So, combining these two equations:

d1 * b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2.

Let me write that as:

d1 * b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange this equation to solve for b in terms of d1 and d0. Let's see:

d1 * b = (d1 + d0)^2 - d0
b = [(d1 + d0)^2 - d0] / d1

Simplify the numerator:

(d1 + d0)^2 - d0 = d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0.

So,

b = [d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0] / d1
= d1 + 2*d0 + (d0^2 - d0)/d1.

Hmm, since b must be an integer, (d0^2 - d0) must be divisible by d1. That gives us a condition on d0 and d1.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation as:

b = (d1 + d0)^2 / d1 - d0 / d1.

Wait, let me see:

From the equation d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2,

We can write:

b = [(d1 + d0)^2 - d0] / d1

= [d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0] / d1

= d1 + 2*d0 + (d0^2 - d0)/d1.

So, for b to be an integer, (d0^2 - d0) must be divisible by d1. So (d0^2 - d0) mod d1 = 0.

Which is equivalent to d0*(d0 - 1) ≡ 0 mod d1.

So, d1 divides d0*(d0 - 1).

Given that d1 is at least 1 and less than b, and d0 is between 0 and b-1.

This seems a bit abstract. Maybe I should fix d1 and d0 and find possible b's.

But perhaps another approach is to consider that n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must satisfy b ≤ n < b^2.

Wait, because the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b which is equal to b in decimal, and the largest two-digit number is (b-1)(b-1)_b which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1.

So n is in [b
