Okay, I have this problem to solve: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it's a root of the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x), which is x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

The product is from k=0 to 12, so that's 13 terms. Each term is of the form 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Wait, maybe I can factor that or find a pattern.

Let me think about each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can rewrite this expression. Let's factor out 2: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me consider it as a quadratic equation: ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Let me denote z = ω^k. Then the term becomes z² - 2z + 2. Wait, can I factor this quadratic?

The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors into (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, each term is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Which can be rewritten as [product from k=0 to 12 (ω^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product from k=0 to 12 (ω^k - (1 - i))].

But wait, since ω^k runs through all the 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12, the product over (ω^k - a) for some a is the same as evaluating the polynomial x¹³ - 1 at x = a, because the product of (x - ω^k) over k=0 to 12 is x¹³ - 1.

Wait, but in this case, the product is over (ω^k - a) instead of (x - ω^k). Wait, hold on, maybe I can think of it as evaluating the polynomial at x = a. Let's see:

The product for k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x¹³ - 1. So, if I plug x = a, I get product (a - ω^k) = a¹³ - 1. Similarly, product (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a - ω^k) = - (a¹³ - 1).

Because x - ω^k = -(ω^k - x), so product (ω^k - a) = product (-1)(a - ω^k) = (-1)^13 product (a - ω^k) = - product (a - ω^k) = -(a¹³ - 1).

So, product (ω^k - a) = -(a¹³ - 1). Therefore, in our case, the two products are:

Product (ω^k - (1 + i)) = -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 )

and

Product (ω^k - (1 - i)) = -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 )

So, the total product is [ -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

Simplify the negatives: (-1) * (-1) = 1, so it's [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].

Now, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2), and its argument is π/4. Similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4.

So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n π/4}.

So, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

First, (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

The argument for (1 + i)^13 is 13 * π/4. Let's compute 13 * π/4 modulo 2π.

13 divided by 8 is 1 with remainder 5, so 13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4. But 3π is the same as π modulo 2π, so (1 + i)^13 has an angle of π + π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13: argument is 13*(-π/4) = -13π/4. Let's compute that modulo 2π. Since -13π/4 is equivalent to adding multiples of 2π until it's positive. Let's see: 2π is 8π/4. So, -13π/4 +
