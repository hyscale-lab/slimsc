Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, since it's a convex equilateral hexagon, all sides are equal in length. Also, all opposite sides are parallel, which probably means it's some kind of regular hexagon but maybe not necessarily regular because it's just equilateral and opposite sides are parallel. Wait, actually, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel, so maybe this is similar.

But the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. So, the hexagon is inside this triangle, and the sides of the triangle are created by extending the sides of the hexagon. Hmm, so maybe the hexagon is like a smaller, similar figure inside the triangle?

Wait, no. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's likely a centrally symmetric hexagon. So, if I imagine the hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is not only parallel but also equal in length. Since it's equilateral, all sides are equal, so opposite sides are equal and parallel.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF. Let me think about how that would look. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, these are three non-consecutive sides of the hexagon. So, when extended, they form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300.

I think this triangle is called the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it. So, maybe the sides of the outer triangle are proportional to the sides of the hexagon. Wait, but the hexagon is equilateral, so all its sides are the same length, say 's'. So, I need to find 's'.

I remember something about similar triangles and perhaps using ratios. Since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, EF form a triangle. Maybe the triangle is divided into smaller sections by the hexagon, each proportional in some way.

Alternatively,
