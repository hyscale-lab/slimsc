Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville and what they own. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, it's about sets and their intersections, right? I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles from my classes.

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each owns some combination of four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Oh, wait, actually, the candy hearts are owned by all residents because it says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So that means every single person owns the candy hearts. That's important.

Now, let's list out the numbers given:

- Number of diamond ring owners (let's call this D) = 195
- Number of golf clubs owners (G) = 367
- Number of garden spade owners (S) = 562
- Number of candy hearts owners (C) = 900 (since everyone has it)
  
Next, it mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four. Hmm, okay, so the problem is about finding the number of people who own all four items, given these other statistics.

Wait, so in set terms, we're dealing with four sets: D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal (everyone has it), maybe it's easier to think in terms of the other three, with C being automatically included.

But maybe I should approach it more methodically. Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets is a bit complicated, but maybe I can use some relationships here.

Wait, but the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three items. That might help. Let me think about how to model this.

Each resident owns 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of these items. But since everyone has the candy hearts, no one owns zero items. So the possible numbers are 1, 2, 3, or 4 things.

Let me denote:

- a = number of people owning exactly 1 item
- b = number owning exactly 2 items = 4
