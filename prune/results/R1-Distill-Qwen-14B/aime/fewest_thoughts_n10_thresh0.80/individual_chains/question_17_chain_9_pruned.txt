Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a set of rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then find r² expressed as a reduced fraction p/q, and finally, compute p+q.

First, let's understand the problem. We're dealing with rectangular boxes, which I assume are rectangular prisms. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can enclose any of these boxes. The radius of this sphere will depend on the dimensions of the box. Since all boxes in set B have the same surface area and volume, I think the sphere's radius might be the same for all of them, but I'm not entirely sure yet.

Wait, no. Actually, the sphere has to enclose each box, so for each box, the sphere must have a radius at least equal to half the space diagonal of the box. But since we need the smallest sphere that can contain each box, we need to find the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in set B, and then the radius will be half of that. So, our goal is to maximize the space diagonal of such boxes, and then take half of that maximum value as r.

But is that right? Because for a given box, the space diagonal is sqrt(l² + w² + h²), where l, w, h are the length, width, height. So, the sphere's radius is half the space diagonal, which would be (1/2)*sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, we need to find the maximum possible value of this expression given that the surface area is 54 and volume is 23.

Therefore, we can model this as an optimization problem. We need to maximize l² + w² + h² subject to the constraints:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 (surface area)
2. lwh = 23 (volume)

So, variables l, w, h are positive real numbers.

We can approach this using methods of multivariable calculus, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers. Alternatively, since all variables are symmetric, maybe we can assume that the maximum occurs when the box is as "stretched out" as possible, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider symmetric cases or use substitutions.

Wait, let me think about the problem again. Since the surface area and volume are fixed, the dimensions l, w, h can vary but must satisfy both constraints. The space diagonal is a function of l, w, h, and we need to find its maximum value.

So, perhaps we can set up the problem with l, w, h as variables, subject to the two constraints.

Let me denote:

Let’s denote S = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 => lw + lh + wh = 27

And V = lwh = 23

We need to maximize l² + w² + h².

Hmm, I remember that for symmetric functions, we can sometimes use the method of Lagrange multipliers or perhaps use AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

But since we have two constraints, perhaps we can use substitution.

Alternatively, let's consider variables x = l, y = w, z = h.

We have:

x y + x z + y z = 27

and

x y z = 23

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

I think it's helpful to note that the expression we want to maximize is related to the squares of the variables, and we have symmetric constraints.

Wait, another approach: we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area.

We know that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx)

We have xy + yz + zx = 27, so:

(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2*27 => x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize (x + y + z)^2, since 54 is a constant.

Therefore, our problem reduces to maximizing (x + y + z)^2, which is equivalent to maximizing x + y + z.

So, now our problem is to maximize x + y + z, given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure if that's correct, but let's proceed.

Wait, but if we're trying to maximize x + y + z, given that the product xyz is fixed, and the sum of products xy + yz + zx is fixed, perhaps we can think in terms of symmetric functions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. Let’s denote the function to maximize as f(x,y,z) = x + y + z.

Subject to the constraints:

g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + zx - 27 = 0

h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0

We can set up the Lagrangian as:

L = x + y + z - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 1 - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 1 - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx = 27

xyz = 23

So, we have a system of equations:

1) 1 = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)

2) 1 = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)

3) 1 = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)

And the two constraints.

Since the equations are symmetric, perhaps we can assume that x = y = z, but wait, let's test that.

If x = y = z, then:

From the surface area:

3x² = 27 => x² = 9 => x = 3

Volume would be x³ = 27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube with surface area 54 has volume 27, but our case has a smaller volume, 23. So, the cube is not the case here, so x, y, z are not all equal.

Therefore, the maximum occurs when the box is not a cube.

Hmm, perhaps the maximum occurs when one of the dimensions is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible, subject to the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let me assume that x = y ≠ z.

So, let me set x = y. Then, we can express everything in terms of x and z.

So, from the surface area:

x² + 2xz = 27

From the volume:

x² z = 23

We can solve for z in terms of x from the volume equation:

z = 23 / x²

Substituting into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27

Simplify:

x² + (46 / x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

We can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Test x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠ 0

x=2: 8 - 54 +46 = 0 → 8 -54 is -46, +46 gives 0. So x=2 is a root.

So, (x - 2) is a factor.

Divide the polynomial by (x - 2):

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46 (constant)

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 2 → add to next coefficient: 0 +2=2

Multiply by 2:4 → add to next coefficient: -27 +4= -23

Multiply by 2: -46 → add to 46: 0

So, the polynomial factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0.

Thus, the roots are x=2, and the roots of x² + 2x -23=0.

Which are x=(-2 ± sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

Since x must be positive, x= -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898

So, x=2, and x≈3.898.

So, in the case where x=y=2, what is z?

From z=23/x²=23/4=5.75.

So, dimensions would be 2,2,5.75.

But wait, let's compute the sum x + y + z: 2 +2 +5.75=9.75.

Alternatively, when x= -1 + 2*sqrt(6)≈3.898, then z=23/(x²)=23/( ( -1 + 2√6 )² )

Compute x²: (-1 + 2√6)² = 1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6.

So, z=23/(25 -4√6). Let's rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/(25² - (4√6)^2 )=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529

Simplify 23/529=1/23.

So, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Then, x + y + z=2*(-1 +2√6)+ (25 +4√6)/23.

Wait, wait, no: x is equal to y, each is -1 +2√6.

So, x + y + z= 2*(-1 +2√6) + (25 +4√6)/23.

Wait, let's compute this numerically to see if it's larger than 9.75.

Compute -1 +2√6≈-1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, 2*3.898≈7.796.

z≈(25 +4*2.449)/23≈(25 +9.796)/23≈34.796/23≈1.513.

So, x + y + z≈7.796 +1.513≈9.309.

Which is less than 9.75.

So, the sum is 9.309 when x=y≈3.898, and 9.75 when x=y=2.

Therefore, when x=y=2, the sum x+y+z=9.75 is larger than the other case.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is such that it's 5.75.

But wait, is that the maximum possible?

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when one of the variables is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible, but still positive.

Wait, the volume is fixed at 23, so if one variable increases, another must decrease to keep the volume fixed.

Perhaps to maximize x + y + z, we can have two variables as small as possible, but given that they need to be positive.

But since the surface area is fixed, we can't have two variables approaching zero because that would require the third to approach infinity, but the surface area would then also approach infinity, which is not the case here.

Wait, but in our case, the surface area is fixed at 54, so if two sides get smaller, the third must adjust to keep the surface area the same.

Wait, perhaps to maximize x + y + z, we need to set two variables equal, as in the case above, but perhaps the maximum is when two variables are equal.

Wait, in the case where x=y=2, z=5.75, the sum is 9.75.

Is that the maximum possible?

Alternatively, let's consider another case where all three variables are different.

But without symmetry, it's harder to calculate. Maybe we can see if 9.75 is indeed the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming symmetry.

So, going back to the Lagrangian:

From the partial derivatives:

1 = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)

1 = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)

1 = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)

Let me subtract the first equation from the second:

0 = λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz)

Simplify: 0 = λ(y - x) + μ(z(y - x))

Factor: 0 = (y - x)(λ + μ z)

Similarly, subtract the second equation from the third:

0 = λ(x + y - x - z) + μ(xy - xz)

Simplify: 0 = λ(y - z) + μ(x(y - z))

Factor: 0 = (y - z)(λ + μ x)

So, from these, either y = x, or λ + μ z = 0,

and similarly, either y = z, or λ + μ x = 0.

Case 1: y = x and y = z.

If y = x = z, then the box is a cube, but as before, the volume would be x³ =23, which is not 27. So, that's not possible because in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, this case is not possible.

Case 2: y = x but y ≠ z.

From the first subtraction, since y ≠ x, then we must have λ + μ z = 0.

Similarly, from the second subtraction, if y ≠ z, then λ + μ x = 0.

So, from λ + μ z = 0 and λ + μ x = 0,

We get μ z = -λ,

μ x = -λ,

So, μ z = μ x → Since μ ≠0 (otherwise, λ would be zero, but then 1 = 0 from the original equations, which is impossible), so z = x.

But we already assumed y = x and y ≠ z, which would imply x ≠ z, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, this case cannot hold.

Case 3: y ≠ x and y ≠ z.

In this case, we must have λ + μ z =0 and λ + μ x=0.

So, from λ + μ z =0 and λ + μ x=0,

We get μ z = -λ = μ x → μ z = μ x.

Assuming μ ≠0, we get z = x.

Similarly, from subtracting other pairs, we might get similar conditions.

Wait, if z =x, then from the earlier equations:

From λ + μ z =0 → λ = -μ z = -μ x.

Similarly, from the third equation, subtracting the first:

Wait, perhaps it's better to substitute z =x into the original Lagrangian equations.

So, with z =x, let's write the partial derivatives:

From ∂L/∂x = 1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

But z =x, so:

1 - λ(y + x) - μ(y x) = 0 → Equation A

From ∂L/∂y =1 - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) =0

But z=x, so:

1 - λ(x +x) - μ(x *x) =0 → 1 - 2λ x - μ x²=0 → Equation B

From ∂L/∂z =1 - λ(x + y) - μ(x y) =0 → Equation C

But z =x, so Equation C is same as Equation A.

So, Equations A and C are the same, and Equation B is a separate equation.

So, now we have:

Equation A:1 - λ(y + x) - μ(x y) =0

Equation B:1 - 2λ x - μ x²=0

Also, our constraints:

xy + yx + xz=27 → 2xy +x²=27

x y z =23 →x y x=23 →x² y=23 →y=23/(x²)

So, substituting y=23/(x²) into Equation A and B.

Equation A:

1 - λ(23/(x²) + x) - μ*(x*(23/(x²))) =0

Simplify:

1 - λ*(x + 23/(x²)) - μ*(23/x) =0 → Equation A'

Equation B:

1 - 2λ x - μ x²=0 → Equation B'

We have two equations (A' and B') with variables λ and μ.

Let me write them as:

Equation A': 1 = λ*(x + 23/(x²)) + μ*(23/x)

Equation B': 1 = 2λ x + μ x²

We can write this as a system:

λ*(x + 23/x²) + μ*(23/x) =1

2λ x + μ x² =1

We can solve this system for λ and μ.

Let me denote:

Let’s let’s write it in matrix form:

[ (x + 23/x²)   (23/x) ] [λ]   = [1]

[    2x          x²     ] [μ]     [1]

We can solve this using Cramer's rule or substitution.

Let me denote the first equation as:

a λ + b μ = 1

c λ + d μ =1

where,

a = x + 23/x²,

b=23/x,

c=2x,

d=x².

The determinant of the coefficient matrix is:

Δ = a d - b c = (x +23/x²)(x²) - (23/x)(2x) = [x^3 +23] - [46] =x^3 +23 -46 =x^3 -23

So, determinant Δ= x^3 -23.

Assuming Δ ≠0, we can solve for λ and μ.

Using Cramer's rule:

λ = (Δ_λ)/Δ,

μ = (Δ_μ)/Δ,

Where Δ_λ is the determinant when replacing the first column with [1,1], and Δ_μ is when replacing the second column.

Compute Δ_λ:

|1   23/x|

|1   x² |

=1*x² -1*(23/x) =x² -23/x.

Similarly, Δ_μ:

|x +23/x²   1|

|2x         1|

= (x +23/x²)*1 - 2x*1 =x +23/x² -2x= -x +23/x².

So,

λ = (x² -23/x) / (x^3 -23)

μ = (-x +23/x²) / (x^3 -23)

Now, let's see if we can find a relationship between λ and μ.

Alternatively, perhaps substitute λ and μ into one of the equations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find expressions for λ and μ in terms of x, then set them back into the equations.

Wait, but perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps instead of dealing with Lagrange multipliers, which is getting complicated, we can use the method of substitution since we have some relations.

Earlier, we assumed that two variables are equal, which gave us possible candidates for maximum.

We saw that when x=y=2, the sum x+y+z=9.75, which is 39/4.

When x=y≈3.898, the sum is ≈9.309.

So, 9.75 is larger, so perhaps the maximum sum is 39/4.

But wait, 39/4 is 9.75, which is the case when x=y=2, z=5.75.

But is that indeed the maximum?

Wait, perhaps we can see if making x and y unequal can give a higher sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is as above.

Wait, but without doing more complicated calculus, perhaps 39/4 is the maximum sum.

But let me test another case. Let me assume that x=1.

Then, from the volume constraint, y z=23.

From the surface area constraint, xy + xz + yz=27 → y + z +23=27 → y + z=4.

So, y + z=4, y z=23.

But wait, y and z are positive numbers. The equation would be t² -4t +23=0.

Discriminant: 16 -92= -76 <0, which means no real solutions. So, x cannot be 1.

Similarly, try x=3.

Then, volume constraint: 3 y z=23 → y z=23/3≈7.6667.

Surface area: 3 y +3 z + y z=27 →3(y + z) + y z=27.

We know y z≈7.6667, so 3(y + z) +7.6667≈27 →3(y + z)≈19.3333 →y + z≈6.4444.

So, let's see if real y and z exist such that y + z≈6.4444 and y z≈7.6667.

The discriminant: (6.4444)^2 -4*7.6667≈41.53 -30.666≈10.86>0, so real roots exist.

So, x=3 is possible.

Then, the sum x+y+z≈3 +6.4444≈9.4444, which is less than 9.75.

So, 9.75 is larger.

Another test: x=1.5.

Volume:1.5 y z=23 → y z≈15.3333.

Surface area:1.5 y +1.5 z + y z=27 →1.5(y + z) +15.3333≈27 →1.5(y + z)≈11.6667 →y + z≈7.7778.

So, y + z≈7.7778 and y z≈15.3333.

Check discriminant: (7.7778)^2 -4*15.3333≈60.5 -61.333≈-0.8333, which is negative, so no real solutions. So, x=1.5 is not possible.

So, perhaps x cannot be less than 2.

Wait, earlier when x=2, it worked, but when x=1.5, it didn't.

So, maybe x must be ≥2.

Wait, let's think about it.

From the volume constraint, x y z=23.

If x decreases, y z must increase to keep the volume fixed.

But the surface area is fixed, so 2(xy + yz + zx)=54 →xy + yz + zx=27.

If x decreases, then y and z must both increase, but their product increases as well.

But when x is too small, the sum y + z might not satisfy the constraints.

Wait, perhaps 2 is the minimum x can be.

Wait, when x approaches zero, y z approaches infinity, but then y + z would also approach infinity, which would make the surface area term xy + yz + zx approach infinity as well, which is not possible since it's fixed at 27.

So, perhaps the feasible region for x is between
