Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be in the form m√n/p, and then I have to find m + n + p. 

First, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, the edges are paired in a symmetric way. AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. So, AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. This seems like a symmetric tetrahedron, maybe something called a "disphenoid." I remember that a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which seems to be the case here. So, maybe this tetrahedron has some nice properties because of its symmetry.

The point I is the incenter, which is the point inside the tetrahedron where the distances to all four faces are equal. In a tetrahedron, the incenter can be found using the formula similar to that in a triangle, but extended to three dimensions. In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In a tetrahedron, the inradius is the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the faces divided by 3, right? So, maybe the formula is:

distance = (3 * volume) / (sum of the areas of the four faces)

Yes, I think that's correct. So, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of each of its four faces.

But wait, since the tetrahedron is symmetric, maybe all the faces are congruent? Let me check. Each face is a triangle with sides from the given edge lengths. Let's see:

Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC. So AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80.

Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD. AB = √41, BD = √80, AD = √89.

Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD. AC = √80, CD = √41, AD = √89.

Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD. BC = √89, CD = √41, BD = √80.

So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. That simplifies things because all the face areas are equal. So, each face has the same area, which I can calculate once and multiply by four for the total surface area.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the area of one face (they’re all the same).
2. Calculate the volume of the tetrahedron.
3. Use the formula: distance = (3 * volume) / (4 * face area) since all four faces have the same area.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is distance = (3 * volume) / (sum of face areas). Since all four faces have the same area, it's (3 * volume) / (4 * face area). So, yes, that's correct.

So, step 1: compute the area of one face.

Each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = √41, b = √80, c = √89.

I can use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter s.

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

But Heron's formula might be messy because of these square roots. Maybe there's a better way, perhaps by using the coordinates?

Wait, perhaps I can find the area in another way. Alternatively, if I can find the volume of the tetrahedron, maybe I can relate it to the areas somehow.

But no, I think it's better to compute the face area first.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, the volume can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix.

Yes, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a way to compute the volume given all the edge lengths. The formula is:

Volume = √[ CM / 288 ], where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.
