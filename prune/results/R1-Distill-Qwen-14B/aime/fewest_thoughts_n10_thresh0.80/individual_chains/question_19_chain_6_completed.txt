Okay, I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. They tell me that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, let me recall what I know about circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that gives me a right angle at I between IA and OI. That might be useful for applying the Pythagorean theorem somewhere.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Wait, let me check that formula again. I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, plugging the given values, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me calculate that: 169 - 2*78 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but in this case, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at I. Therefore, IA² + OI² = OA². Since OA is the circumradius, which is 13, so OA² is 169.

I know that IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. Wait, but IA isn't necessarily the inradius. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, not to a vertex. So IA must be something else.

Wait, I think there's a formula for the length of AI in terms of the triangle's sides. Let me recall. The formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is AI = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A.

Alternatively, another formula is AI = (2R sin(A/2)). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, in the right triangle OIA, I can write IA² + OI² = OA². So IA² = OA² - OI² = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

So, IA is 2*sqrt(39). Now, I need to relate this to the sides of the triangle.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles. Let me recall the formula. I think AI = (r) / sin(A/2). So, AI = 6 / sin(A/2). But we just found that AI is 2*sqrt(39). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, because sqrt(39) is sqrt(13*3), so 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13. So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Now, from trigonometry, I know that cos(A) can be expressed in terms of sin(A/2). Since cos(A) = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2). So, cos(A) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / 13² = 7/13.

So, cos(A) = 7/13. That means angle A has cosine 7/13, so angle A is arccos(7/13). But I might not need the angle itself, but rather the sides.

I need to find AB * AC. Let me denote AB as c and AC as b. Then, AB * AC = b * c.

I know that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, area = (1/2)*b*c*sin(A). So, if I can find the area in another way, perhaps in terms of the inradius, I can relate it.

The area of the triangle can also be expressed as r*s, where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter. So, area = 6*s.

So, setting the two expressions for area equal: (1/2)*b*c*sin(A) = 6*s. So, b*c = (12*s) / sin(A).

Wait, but I might need another approach because I don't know s, the semi-perimeter, yet.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Cosines. Since I know cos(A), I can relate the sides. Law of Cosines says that a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos(A), where a is the side opposite angle A, which would be BC.

But I don't know the lengths of any sides yet, so maybe I need another formula.

Wait, another formula: The distance from the incenter to vertex A is AI = (r) / sin(A/2), and we also had AI = 2*sqrt(39). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39), which gave us sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Alternatively, I can find expressions involving the sides. Let me think about the semi-perimeter, s.

In triangle ABC, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. The inradius formula is r = area / s, so area = r*s = 6s.

Also, using the formula for the circumradius R: R = (a*b*c) / (4*area). So, 13 = (a*b*c)/(4*6s) => 13 = (a*b*c)/(24s).

So, a*b*c = 13*24s = 312s.

Hmm, but I have a*b*c = 312 s.

But I don't know s yet. Maybe I can find s in terms of the sides.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for AI in terms of the sides. Let me recall that.

I think AI = (r) / sin(A/2), which we have as 2*sqrt(39). Also, another formula for AI is ( (b + c)/2 ) * (1 + cos(A)), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the formula for AI.

Wait, upon some recollection, AI = (2R sin(A/2)), but wait, earlier I thought AI = r / sin(A/2). Let me confirm this.

Wait, I think the correct formula is AI = r / sin(A/2). So, since we have AI = 2*sqrt(39) and r = 6, then:

AI = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39) ⇒ sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, that's consistent with what I found earlier. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, which I used to find cos(A) = 7/13.

Okay, so angle A has cos(A) = 7/13, sin(A) = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

So, sin(A) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

Now, going back to the area formula: area = (1/2)*b*c*sin(A) = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13.

But also, area = r*s = 6s.

So, 6s = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13. Therefore, b*c = (6s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78s)/sqrt(30).

Hmm, but I need to find b*c. So, if I can express s in terms of the sides, maybe using the Law of Cosines.

Wait, Law of Cosines says a² = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13). So, a² = b² + c² - (14/13) bc.

But without knowing a, it's hard to use this.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the semi-perimeter in terms of the sides: s = (a + b + c)/2. But again, without knowing a, not helpful directly.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semi-perimeter and the formula in terms of sides and angles.

Alternatively, perhaps using another formula that relates the sides with the inradius and the circumradius.

Wait, there's a formula: R = (abc)/(4K), where K is the area, and we know r = K/s.

So, R = (abc)/(4*(r s)) = (abc)/(4*6s) = (abc)/(24s). So, 13 = abc/(24s) ⇒ abc = 312 s.

So, abc = 312 s.

But we also have area K = (b c sin A)/2 = (b c (2 sqrt(30)/13))/2 = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

But K is also equal to r s = 6 s.

So, (b c sqrt(30))/13 = 6 s ⇒ b c = (6 s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

So, bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

But from abc = 312 s, we can write a = (312 s)/(b c).

Substituting bc from above: a = (312 s) / (78 s / sqrt(30)) ) = (312 s * sqrt(30)) / (78 s) = (312 /78 ) * sqrt(30) = 4 * sqrt(30).

So, a = 4 sqrt(30). That's the length of side a, which is BC.

Now that I know a, I can plug back into the Law of Cosines.

Law of Cosines: a² = b² + c² - 2 bc cos A.

We have a = 4 sqrt(30), so a² = 16 *30 = 480.

Also, cos A = 7/13, so 2 bc cos A = 2 bc *7/13 = (14 bc)/13.

So, 480 = b² + c² - (14 bc)/13.

Hmm, that equation relates b and c. We need another equation to solve for bc.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

But since a is known, s = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

But we might not have enough info yet.

Alternatively, perhaps using the area formula K = 6 s = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

So, 6 s = (b c sqrt(30))/13 ⇒ s = (b c sqrt(30))/(78).

But s is also (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So, (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 = (b c sqrt(30))/78.

Let me write that as:

(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = (2 b c sqrt(30))/78 = (b c sqrt(30))/39.

So,

4 sqrt(30) + b + c = (b c sqrt(30))/39.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can express b + c in terms of bc.

Alternatively, let's denote bc = x. Then, we can write the equation in terms of x.

From earlier, 480 = b² + c² - (14 x)/13.

But I also know that (b + c)^2 = b² + c² + 2 bc. So, b² + c² = (b + c)^2 - 2x.

Plugging into the previous equation:

480 = (b + c)^2 - 2x - (14 x)/13.

Simplify: 480 = (b + c)^2 - (2x + 14x/13) = (b + c)^2 - (26x +14x)/13 = (b + c)^2 - (40x)/13.

So,

(b + c)^2 = 480 + (40x)/13.

But from the other equation, 4 sqrt(30) + b + c = (x sqrt(30))/39 ⇒ b + c = (x sqrt(30))/39 - 4 sqrt(30).

So, let's square both sides of this:

(b + c)^2 = [ (x sqrt(30))/39 - 4 sqrt(30) ]².

Expanding this:

= [ (x sqrt(30))/39 ]² - 2*(x sqrt(30))/39 *4 sqrt(30) + (4 sqrt(30))².

Calculate each term:

First term: (x² * 30) / (39²) = (30 x²) / 1521 = (10 x²)/507.

Second term: 2*(x sqrt(30)/39)*(4 sqrt(30)) = 8*(x * 30)/39 = 240 x /39 = 80 x /13.

But since it's subtracted, the second term is -80x/13.

Third term: (16 * 30) = 480.

So, putting it all together,

(b + c)^2 = (10 x²)/507 - (80 x)/13 + 480.

But earlier, we had (b + c)^2 = 480 + (40x)/13.

So, set them equal:

(10 x²)/507 - (80 x)/13 + 480 = 480 + (40x)/13.

Subtract 480 from both sides:

(10 x²)/507 - (80 x)/13 = (40x)/13.

Bring all terms to the left:

(10 x²)/507 - (80x)/13 - (40x)/13 = 0 ⇒

(10x²)/507 - (120x)/13 = 0.

Factor out x/13:

x/13 [ (10x)/39 - 120 ] = 0.

So, either x=0, which is impossible for a triangle, or:

(10x)/39 - 120 = 0 ⇒ 10x = 120 *39 ⇒ x= (120 *39)/10 = 12*39= 468.

So, x=468. But x was bc, so bc=468.

Therefore, AB * AC = bc = 468.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me recap:

We had:

From the area: bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

From the Law of Cosines: 480 = b² + c² - (14 bc)/13.

Expressed b² + c² in terms of (b +c)^2 and substituted.

Set up an equation for (b +c)^2 in two different ways and ended up with x=468.

Yes, that seems consistent. So, the product AB * AC is 468.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). Given that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2 \).

Using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \), we find:
\[
OI^2 = 13^2 - 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \quad \Rightarrow \quad OI = \sqrt{13}.
\]
In the right triangle \( OIA \), we have:
\[
IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad IA^2 = 13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 \quad \Rightarrow \quad IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}.
\]
The distance from the incenter to vertex \( A \) is given by \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \). Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
\]
Using the identity \( \cos(A) = 1 - 2\sin^2(A/2) \), we find:
\[
\cos(A) = 1 - 2\left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{78}{169} = \frac{91}{169} = \frac{7}{13}.
\]
The area of the triangle can be expressed in two ways: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}bc\sin(A) \) and \( \text{Area} = r \cdot s \), where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter. Equating these:
\[
\frac{1}{2}bc\sin(A) = 6s \quad \Rightarrow \quad bc = \frac{12s}{\sin(A)}.
\]
Using \( \sin(A) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(A)} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{7}{13}\right)^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \), we get:
\[
bc = \frac{12s \cdot 13}{2\sqrt{30}} = \frac{78s}{\sqrt{30}}.
\]
The circumradius formula \( R = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot \text{Area}} \) gives:
\[
13 = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 6s} \quad \Rightarrow \quad abc = 312s.
\]
Substituting \( a = 4\sqrt{30} \) (found using the Law of Cosines and solving for \( a \)), we find:
\[
bc = 468.
\]
Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is \( \boxed{468} \).
