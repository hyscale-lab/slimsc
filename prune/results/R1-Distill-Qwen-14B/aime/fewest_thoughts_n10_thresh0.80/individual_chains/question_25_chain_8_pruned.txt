Okay, so I have this math problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. It's about sets and maybe using some principles from set theory to figure out how many people own all four items. Hmm, let me read the problem again.

Alright, so there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Then, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Wait, and then it says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are like a given for everyone, right? So, every resident has at least that.

Now, the next part says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things and 234 who own exactly three of them. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things. So, we have four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since everyone has the candy hearts, maybe that's the universal set here.

I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this. Let me recall what that is. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering all possible intersections. But in this case, we're dealing with the exact number of people owning exactly two or three items, so maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, the problem is about the number of residents owning exactly two or three things. And we need to find those owning all four. Hmm. Let me jot down the given numbers:

Total residents, N = 900.

Number owning diamond ring, D = 195.

Number owning golf clubs, G = 367.

Number owning garden spade, S = 562.

Number owning candy hearts, C = 900 (since every resident has this).

Number owning exactly two things: exactly two = 437.

Number owning exactly three things: exactly three = 234.

We are to find the number owning all four, which is exactly four, let's call that x.

I think the key here is to use the formula that relates the total number of elements in the union of sets to the sum of individual sets, minus the sum of all pairwise intersections, plus
