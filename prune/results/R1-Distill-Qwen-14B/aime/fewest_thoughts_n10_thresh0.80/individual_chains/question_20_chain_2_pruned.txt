Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. The chips are either white or black, and each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are a bit specific: all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for each column. Plus, any additional chip would break these rules. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

First, I think the key here is that each row and each column must have chips of the same color. So, for every row, I can choose either white or black, and similarly for each column. But wait, there's a catch because the colors of rows and columns aren't independent. If I choose a row to be white, then all the columns that intersect this row must also be white, right? Because if a column has a white chip in a white row, then that column can't have any other color elsewhere, otherwise, we'd have two different colors in the same column, which isn't allowed.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think. If I have a row colored white, then all the chips in that row are white. But each column that intersects this row must have all their chips as the same color. So, for each column, if it has a white chip in the white row, then all other chips in that column must be white. Alternatively, if the column doesn't have a chip in that white row, it's free to choose its color.

Hmm, actually, that might complicate things. Maybe a better way to approach this is to model the grid as a bipartite graph, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of selecting monochromatic rows and columns and making sure that the intersections don't violate the conditions.

Wait, let's consider the problem statement again. It says that all chips in the same row and same column have the same color. So each row is uniformly colored, and each column is uniformly colored. But there's no restriction on the row and column colors themselves, except that they can't conflict with each other.

However, the second condition says that if you add any additional chip, it would violate the first two conditions. So the placement is maximal in the sense that you can't add any more chips without causing a row or
