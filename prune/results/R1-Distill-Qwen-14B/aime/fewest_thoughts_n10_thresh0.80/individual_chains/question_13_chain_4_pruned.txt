Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's walking and coffee shop time. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop. There are two scenarios given regarding her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop.

In the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, and the total time taken is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. Wait, but 4 hours is 240 minutes, right? So the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals 240 minutes.

In the second scenario, she walks at a speed of 's + 2' kilometers per hour, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that into minutes as well. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes total. So again, the walking time at this increased speed plus the same coffee shop time 't' equals 144 minutes.

Wait, so the coffee shop time 't' is the same in both scenarios because she stops at the same coffee shop each time, right? So that means I can set up equations with 't' as a constant and solve for 's' first.

Let me try to write down these equations.

For the first scenario:
Walking speed = s km/h
Total time including coffee shop = 4 hours = 240 minutes
Time taken to walk 9 km = total time - coffee shop time
So, time = (distance)/(speed) = 9/s hours. But wait, time is usually in hours when speed is km/h. But the total time given is in hours, which includes coffee shop time. So maybe I should convert everything to hours instead of minutes to avoid confusion.

Let me think again.

First scenario:
Total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes
Time walking = (9 km) / (s km/h) = 9/s hours
Then, coffee shop time = total time - walking time = 4 - (9/s) hours.

But the coffee shop time is given in minutes as 't' minutes. So 4 hours is 240 minutes, and walking time is 9/s hours
