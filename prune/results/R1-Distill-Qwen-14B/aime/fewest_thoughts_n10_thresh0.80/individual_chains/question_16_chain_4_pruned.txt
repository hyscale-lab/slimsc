Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. Once I have that p, I need the smallest m making m⁴ + 1 divisible by p².

I remember that primes where -1 is a quartic residue are important here. A quartic residue modulo p means there exists some x such that x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. So, for primes where this holds, maybe p² can divide some n⁴ +1.

Wait, but for a prime p, if -1 is a quartic residue mod p, does that mean that there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p²? Or do I need more conditions?

I think I remember something about Hensel's lemma, which allows lifting solutions from mod p to mod p² under certain conditions. So, if there's a solution mod p, and the derivative of the polynomial doesn't vanish at that solution, then there's a unique lift mod p².

The polynomial here is f(n) = n⁴ + 1. Its derivative is f'(n) = 4n³. So, for Hensel's lemma, if f(a) ≡ 0 mod p and f'(a) not ≡ 0 mod p, then we can lift the solution.

So, for a prime p, if -1 is a quartic residue mod p, and the derivative at that point isn't 0 mod p, then we can lift the solution, meaning there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, p² divides n⁴ +1.

So, I need to find the smallest prime p where -1 is a quartic residue mod p, and the derivative 4a³ ≢ 0 mod p, where a is a solution to a⁴ ≡ -1 mod p.

Let me think about the conditions for -1 being a quartic residue. Since the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, -1 is a quartic residue iff the order of -1 divides (p-1)/4. Wait, maybe another way: -1 is a quadratic residue if p ≡ 1 mod 4. But for quartic residues, the conditions are stricter.

Wait, in general, the number of quartic residues is (p-1)/4. So, for -1 to be a quartic residue, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution.

Let me recall that -1 is a quartic residue mod p if and only if 8 divides the order of -1 in the multiplicative group. Wait, not exactly. Let me think differently.

If x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then x^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So, the order of x mod p divides 8. But since x⁴ ≡ -1, x^8 ≡ 1, so the order of x must be 8. Therefore, 8 must divide p-1 because the multiplicative group mod p has order p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, no, because the multiplicative group is cyclic, so if 8 divides p-1, then there exists an element of order 8, which means that x^8 ≡ 1 has a solution. But we need x^4 ≡ -1. So, does that mean that 8 divides p-1?

Yes, because the multiplicative group has order p-1. So, for x^4 ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, the multiplicative group must have an element of order 8. So, 8 divides p-1. Therefore, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, the primes p where -1 is a quartic residue are primes ≡1 mod 8.

So, the smallest such primes are 17, 97, etc. Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait: 17 is 1 mod 16, but 8 divides 16? Wait, no, 17 is 1 mod 16, which is also 1 mod 8. But the first few primes ≡1 mod 8 are 17, 97, 113, etc. Wait, no, is 17 the smallest?

Wait, 2 is 2 mod 8, 3 is 3, 5 is 5, 7 is 7, 11 is 3, 13 is 5, 17 is 1. So, yes, 17 is the first prime ≡1 mod 8.

So, the primes p must be ≡1 mod 8. So, 17 is the first candidate.

But wait, let me check p=2. For p=2, does there exist n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4? Let's see. n⁴ mod 4: for any n, n is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 mod 4.

If n is even, n=2k, n⁴=16k⁴ ≡0 mod4. Then n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod4, which isn't 0. If n is odd, n=2k+1, n⁴ = (1)^4=1 mod4, so n⁴+1=2 mod4, which isn't 0. So, for p=2, no solution.

Similarly, p=3: Let's see n⁴ mod9. n runs from 0 to 8 mod9.

n=0: 0+1=1
n=1:1+1=2
n=2:16+1=17≡8
n=3:81+1=82≡1
n=4:256+1=257≡257-28*9=257-252=5
n=5:625+1=626; 626-69*9=626-621=5
n=6:1296+1=1297≡1297-144*9=1297-1296=1
n=7: same as n=2 because 7≡-2 mod9: 7^4= (-2)^4=16≡7 mod9? Wait, 7^2=49≡4 mod9, 7^4= (7^2)^2= 16≡7 mod9. So, 7+1=8 mod9. So, same as n=2.

n=8: same as n=-1, so (-1)^4=1, then 1+1=2 mod9.

So, n⁴ +1 mod9: 1,2,8,1,5,5,1,8,2. So, does any n⁴+1≡0 mod9? 0 isn't in the list. So, p=3 doesn't work.

p=5: Let's compute n⁴ mod25.

But wait, maybe I can think smarter. For primes p≡1 mod4, -1 is a quadratic residue. But for quartic residues, it's more restrictive, requiring p≡1 mod8.

Wait, but 5 is 5 mod8. So, 5≡5 mod8, so p=5, which is 5 mod8. So, does it have a solution to x^4 ≡-1 mod5?

Compute x^4 mod5 for x=0,1,2,3,4.

x=0:0
x=1:1
x=2:16≡1
x=3:81≡1
x=4:256≡1

Wait, all x^4 ≡0 or 1 mod5. So, x^4 +1 ≡1 or 2 mod5. So, never 0. So, p=5 doesn't work.

Similarly, p=7: Let me see if x^4 ≡-1 mod7 has a solution.

x^4 mod7: Compute for x=0-6.

x=0:0
x=1:1
x=2:16≡2
x=3:81≡4
x=4:256≡256-36*7=256-252=4
x=5:625≡625-89*7=625-623=2
x=6:1296≡1296-185*7=1296-1295=1

So, x^4 mod7 is 0,1,2,4,4,2,1. So, x^4 +1 is 1,2,3,5,5,3,2. So, no 0 mod7. So, p=7 doesn't work.

Next prime is 11. 11≡3 mod8. Let's see x^4 mod11.

But maybe it's easier to see whether 8 divides p-1. So, for 11, p=11, p-1=10. 8 doesn't divide 10, so p=11 shouldn't have x^4 ≡-1 mod11.

Wait, maybe I should compute it anyway.

x=0:0
x=1:1
x=2:16≡5
x=3:81≡4
x=4:256≡256-23*11=256-253=3
x=5:625≡625-56*11=625-616=9
x=6:1296≡1296-117*11=1296-1287=9
x=7:2401≡2401-218*11=2401-2398=3
x=8:4096≡4096-372*11=4096-4092=4
x=9:6561≡6561-596*11=6561-6556=5
x=10:10000≡10000-909*11=10000-9999=1

So, x^4 mod11 gives 0,1,5,4,3,9,9,3,4,5,1. So, x^4 +1 is 1,2,6,5,4,10,10,4,5,6,2. No zero. So, p=11 doesn't work.

Next prime is 13, which is 5 mod8. So, p=13. Let's see x^4 mod13.

x=0:0
x=1:1
x=2:16≡3
x=3:81≡3
x=4:256≡256-19*13=256-247=9
x=5:625≡625-48*13=625-624=1
x=6:1296≡1296-99*13=1296-1287=9
x=7:2401≡2401-184*13=2401-2392=9
x=8:4096≡4096-315*13=4096-4095=1
x=9:6561≡6561-504*13=6561-6552=9
x=10:10000≡10000-769*13=10000-9997=3
x=11:14641≡14641-1126*13=14641-14638=3
x=12:20736≡20736-1595*13=20736-20735=1

Wait, so x^4 mod13 is 0,1,3,3,9,1,9,9,1,9,3,3,1.

So, x^4 +1 is 1,2,4,4,10,2,10,10,2,10,4,4,2. No zeros. So, p=13 doesn't work.

Next prime is 17, which is 1 mod8. So, p=17.

Let me check if x^4 ≡-1 mod17 has a solution.

Compute x^4 mod17:

x=0:0
x=1:1
x=2:16
x=3:81≡13
x=4:256≡1
x=5:625≡625-36*17=625-612=13
x=6:1296≡1296-76*17=1296-1292=4
x=7:2401≡2401-141*17=2401-2397=4
x=8:4096≡4096-241*17=4096-4097= -1≡16
x=9:6561≡6561-386*17=6561-6562= -1≡16
x=10:10000≡10000-588*17=10000-9996=4
x=11:14641≡14641-861*17=14641-14637=4
x=12:20736≡20736-1220*17=20736-20740= -4≡13
x=13:28561≡28561-1680*17=28561-28560=1
x=14:38416≡38416-2259*17=38416-38403=13
x=15:50625≡50625-2978*17=50625-50626= -1≡16
x=16:16^4=65536≡65536 mod17. Wait, 16 ≡-1 mod17, so 16^4 = (-1)^4=
