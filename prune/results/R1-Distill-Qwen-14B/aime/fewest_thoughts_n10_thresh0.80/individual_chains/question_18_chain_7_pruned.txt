Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees. So, the figure is pretty symmetric, which should help in counting the rectangles.

The problem mentions that each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, I need to figure out how these rectangles are formed. I think the key is to consider the diagonals and sides as lines that can form the sides of rectangles. But how?

Maybe I should think about the properties of a rectangle. A rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles are 90 degrees. So, in the context of a dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned in such a way that their angles are 90 degrees relative to each other.

Wait, but the dodecagon isn't a square, so the diagonals and sides won't naturally form right angles. Maybe the rectangles are formed by selecting four points on the dodecagon such that the lines connecting them form a rectangle.

Alternatively, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon, meaning they are either sides or diagonals. So, maybe each side of the rectangle is a chord of the dodecagon, and the rectangle is formed by four such chords that meet at right angles.

But how do I find all such rectangles? Maybe I should think in terms of selecting four points on the dodecagon that form a rectangle. But not any four points will form a rectangle; they need to satisfy the properties of a rectangle.

I remember that in a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed by selecting pairs of points that are symmetric with respect to the center. So, maybe each rectangle is determined by two pairs of opposite points, each pair being symmetric.

Wait, but a regular dodecagon has 12 points, so perhaps the rectangles are determined by selecting two distinct diameters (lines passing through the center) and then using those as the diagonals of the rectangle. Because if two diameters intersect at the center, they would form a rectangle
