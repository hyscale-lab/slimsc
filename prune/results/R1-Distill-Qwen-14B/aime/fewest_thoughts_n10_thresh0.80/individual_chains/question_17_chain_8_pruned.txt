Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I need to find p + q. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, let me recall some basics. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, and z. The surface area (SA) of such a box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) and the volume (V) is xyz. 

So, according to the problem, SA = 54 and V = 23. Therefore, I can write the equations:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27  
xyz = 23

Now, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius (r) of the sphere is half of that, so r = d/2. Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimal r², which is equivalent to finding the minimal value of (x² + y² + z²)/4. Since 4 is a constant, it's the same as minimizing x² + y² + z².

So, I need to minimize x² + y² + z² given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.

This looks like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers for this, but since it's symmetric in x, y, z, maybe I can assume that the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when x = y = z? Wait, but if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x = 3, so x = y = z = 3. Then the volume would be 3*3*3 = 27. But in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27, so a cube isn't possible here. So, the minimal sphere must be for a box that's not a cube. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let me assume that x = y ≠ z. Maybe that will help.

Let me set x = y. Then, from the volume equation: x * x * z = x² z = 23 → z = 23/(x²). 

From the surface area: xy + yz + xz = x² + 2xz = 27. Substituting z = 23/(x²), we have:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27  
x² + (46/x) = 27  
Multiply both sides by x:  
x³ + 46 = 27x  
x³ -27x +46 = 0

Hmm, so I need to solve this cubic equation: x³ -27x +46 = 0. Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠ 0  
x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 → 8 -54 is -46 +46 = 0. So x=2 is a root. Great.

So, factor the cubic: (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0. So the roots are x=2, and x² +2x -23=0. Solving this quadratic: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4√6]/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

Since x must be positive, x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.899 ≈ 3.899. So the roots are x=2, and x ≈3.899.

Now, let's consider these cases.

Case 1: x=2, so since x=y, y=2. Then z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, x=y=2, z=5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z²: 2² + 2² + (23/4)^2 = 4 +4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625, which is 41.0625 = 657/16. So r² = (657/16)/4 = 657/64 ≈10.265625.

Case 2: x = -1 + 2√6 ≈3.899. Then y=x≈3.899, z=23/(x²). Let me compute x²: ( (-1 + 2√6) )² = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24 = 25 -4√6.

So z=23/(25 -4√6). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] = 23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6) = 23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96) = 23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify: 23 cancels with 529 (which is 23²), so z=(25 +4√6)/23.

So z≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

Now, x² + y² + z² = 2x² + z².

We already have x²=25 -4√6. So 2x² = 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

z² = [ (25 +4√6)/23 ]² = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529 = (721 + 200√6)/529.

So total x²+y²+z² = (50 -8√6) + (721 + 200√6)/529.

Let me compute this:

First, write 50 as 50*529/529 and -8√6 as (-8√6)*
