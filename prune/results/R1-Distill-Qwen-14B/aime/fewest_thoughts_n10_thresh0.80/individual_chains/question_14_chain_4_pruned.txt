Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the solution step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

Let me try to break that down. So, N has four digits: let's denote them as D1, D2, D3, D4. So, N = D1 D2 D3 D4 in decimal digits.

The condition is that if I change any one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, changing D1 to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Similarly, changing D2, D3, or D4 to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

So, for example, changing the thousands digit (D1) to 1 gives a number 1D2D3D4, which is divisible by 7. Similarly, changing D2 to 1 gives D1 1 D3 D4, which is divisible by 7, and so on for D3 and D4.

Our goal is to find the largest such four-digit number N, then compute Q and R when N is divided by 1000 (so Q is the thousands digit, and R is the last three digits). Then sum Q + R.

Alright, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find N such that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, it's likely that N is as large as possible, so probably 9999 or near it, but with specific digits that satisfy the conditions.

Let me consider that N is the four-digit number ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change A to 1, we get 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D, which must be divisible by 7.

Changing C to 1 gives AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D, which must be divisible by 7.

Changing D to 1 gives ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1, which must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. Therefore, each of them mod 7 must be 0.

So, let me write down these conditions mathematically.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

And the original number N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D must be the greatest four-digit number, so we want to maximize N, so maximize A, then B, then C, then D.

So, since we're looking for the greatest N, we can start checking from 9999 downwards, but considering the constraints.

But maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about each condition.

First, note that 1000 ≡ something mod 7. Let me compute 1000 mod 7.

7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, and 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let me rewrite each condition.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, that's a system of four congruences with variables A, B, C, D, each digit from 0-9, with A ≥ 1 since it's a four-digit number.

We need to find the maximum N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D that satisfies all four conditions.

Let me see if I can find relationships between these equations.

Let me denote the four equations as:

Equation 1: 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod 7

Equation 2: 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod 7

Equation 3: 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod 7

Equation 4: 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod 7

Wait, perhaps subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let me try subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1: (6A + 3C + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡ (-2) - (-6) mod 7

So, 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7

Which simplifies to 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7.

We can write this as 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7, by dividing both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, so 2 has an inverse mod 7, which is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So multiplying both sides by 4:

(6A - 2B)*4 ≡ 4*4 mod7 => 24A - 8B ≡ 16 mod7.

But 24 mod7 is 3 (7*3=21, 24-21=3), and 8 mod7 is 1, so 3A - B ≡ 16 mod7.

16 mod7 is 2, so 3A - B ≡ 2 mod7.

So Equation 2 - Equation 1 gives us 3A - B ≡ 2 mod7. Let's call this Equation 5.

Similarly, let's compute Equation 3 - Equation 1:

Equation3: 6A +2B + D ≡ -3 mod7

Equation1: 2B +3C + D ≡ -6 mod7

Subtract Equation1 from Equation3: (6A + 2B + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡ (-3) - (-6) mod7

So, 6A - 3C ≡ 3 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Factor out 3: 3(2A - C) ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3: 2A - C ≡1 mod7 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, so inverse of 3 mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So multiply both sides by 5: 3*5*(2A - C) ≡3*5 mod7 => 15(2A - C) ≡15 mod7, which is (15 mod7)(2A - C) ≡15 mod7.

But 15 mod7 is 1, so 1*(2A - C) ≡1 mod7 => 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Let me call this Equation6: 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, compute Equation4 - Equation3:

Equation4: 6A +2B +3C ≡-1 mod7

Equation3:6A +2B + D ≡-3 mod7

Subtract Equation3 from Equation4: (6A +2B +3C) - (6A +2B + D) ≡ (-1) - (-3) mod7

So, 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Let me call this Equation7: 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So, now, let's list the equations we have:

Equation5: 3A - B ≡2 mod7

Equation6: 2A - C ≡1 mod7

Equation7: 3C - D ≡2 mod7

And the original four equations.

But perhaps let's see if we can express B, C, D in terms of A.

From Equation5: 3A - B ≡2 mod7 => B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Since B is a digit (0-9), once we know A, we can compute B ≡3A -2 mod7. So B is in 0-9, so possible values are (3A -2) mod7, plus or minus 7 to get into 0-9.

Similarly, from Equation6: 2A - C ≡1 mod7 => C ≡2A -1 mod7.

So C is determined mod7 as 2A -1.

From Equation7: 3C - D ≡2 mod7 => D ≡3C -2 mod7.

But since we know C in terms of A, we can write D in terms of A.

So, let me try to express B, C, D in terms of A.

Let me denote:

B ≡3A -2 mod7, so B = (3A -2) +7k, where k is an integer such that B is between 0 and9.

Similarly, C ≡2A -1 mod7, so C=(2A -1) +7m, where m is integer, 0 ≤ C ≤9.

Similarly, D ≡3C -2 mod7, so D=3C -2 +7n, where n is integer, 0 ≤ D ≤9.

But this might get complicated, but perhaps we can proceed step by step.

Since we want the maximum N, which is 1000A +100B +10C + D, so to maximize N, we need to maximize A first, then B, then C, then D.

So, let's start with A=9, the maximum possible. Let's see if that works.

Case 1: A=9.

Compute B: B ≡3*9 -2 mod7 => 27 -2=25 mod7. 25 /7=3*7=21, 25-21=4. So B≡4 mod7. Since B is a digit, possible values are 4 and 11, but 11 is invalid, so B=4.

Wait, wait, 4 mod7 is 4, but B can be 4 or 4+7=11, but 11 is not a digit, so B=4.

So for A=9, B=4.

Then compute C: C ≡2*9 -1 mod7=18-1=17 mod7. 17-14=3, so C≡3 mod7. Possible values: 3 and 10, but 10 is invalid, so C=3.

Wait, wait, 2A=18, 18-1=17. 17 mod7 is 3. So C=3 or 3+7=10. But C must be a single digit, so C=3.

Then compute D: D ≡3*C -2 mod7. C=3, so 3*3=9-2=7. 7 mod7=0. So D≡0 mod7. So D=0 or 7.

But D must be 0,7.

So, possible D=0 or 7.

So let me check whether with A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or 7, the original number N=9430 or 9437 satisfies all four conditions.

Wait, but we need to check whether changing each digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

So, let me compute N=9430.

Changing the first digit to 1: 1430. Let's check if 1430 is divisible by7: 1430/7. 7*200=1400, 1430-1400=30. 30/7 is about 4.28, so no. 1430 is not divisible by7. So N=9430 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Similarly, N=9437: changing first digit to1: 1437. Check 1437/7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. So remainder 2, not divisible. So N=9437 also doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, so A=9 doesn't work because when we change the first digit to 1, the resulting number isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that with A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7, the resulting number satisfies all four conditions.

Wait, but perhaps I should go back and check each condition.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all four conditions for N=9430 and N=9437.

Wait, but in the problem, when you change any one digit to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by7. So, for N=9430, changing A to1: 1430. Is 1430 divisible by7? Let me compute 1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. So remainder 2. So no, it's not divisible by7. So N=9430 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Same for N=9437: first digit change: 1437. 1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. So remainder 2. Not divisible.

So, A=9 seems not to work. So, perhaps I need to try A=8.

Case 2: A=8.

Compute B: B≡3*8 -2 mod7=24-2=22 mod7. 22-21=1, so B≡1 mod7. So possible B=1 or 1+7=8.

Since we want the maximum N, let's pick the largest possible B, which is 8.

Wait, but wait
