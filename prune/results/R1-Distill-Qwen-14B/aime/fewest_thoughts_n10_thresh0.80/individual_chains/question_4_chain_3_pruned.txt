Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Alice and Bob token game problem. Let me try to understand it step by step. The game is as follows: there's a stack of n tokens, and two players, Alice and Bob, take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make it so that Bob has a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm. So this is a classic combinatorial game theory problem. The key is to determine for each n whether the starting player (Alice) can force a win or if the second player (Bob) can. The numbers where Bob can force a win are called losing positions for Alice, or in other words, winning positions for Bob.

I remember that in such games, we can model the positions as either winning or losing. A position is a losing position if every move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position is one where there's at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

So, let's try to model this. Let's define a function f(n) where f(n) is true if the current player can force a win, and false otherwise. We need to find for which n, f(n) is false (meaning Bob can win if he's the second player).

Base cases: 
- If n=0, the game is over, so the current player can't make a move. So, f(0) is false because the player to move loses.
Wait, but in our case, the player who takes the last token wins. So, if n=0, the previous player took the last token and won. So, the current player can't move and loses. So, f(0) is false.

Wait, maybe I should think about n=1: the current player can take 1 token and win. So, f(1)=true.

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. Then the opponent can take 1 and win. So, wait, that's bad. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because n=2, so can't take 4. So, the only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then win. So, f(2)=false? Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. If the current player takes 1 from n=2, leaving 1, then the opponent can take that 1 and win. So, the current player at n=2 is in a losing position, so f(2)=false.

Wait, no, wait. When n=1, the current player can take 1 and win. So if it's your turn when n=1, you can win. So, for n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So the current player at n=2 is in a losing position, so f(2)=false.

Wait, let me correct that. If I'm at n=
