Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many of these paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay.

First, let me visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So, moving from the lower left (let's say point (0,0)) to the upper right (point (8,8)), the path can only move right or up. Each step is either right or up, and the total number of steps is 16 because to go from (0,0) to (8,8), you need 8 rights and 8 ups, totaling 16 steps.

Wait, but the problem mentions paths of length 16. So that makes sense because each move is a unit step either right or up. So the total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time (for the right moves), which is C(16,8). But here, we have a restriction: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, changing direction four times. So, what does that mean? Well, each time you change direction, you switch from moving right to up or up to right. So, in a path, you alternate between right and up moves. For example, if the first move is right, then the second direction would be up, then right, then up, and so on.

But wait, how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of "runs" or consecutive steps in the same direction? Oh right, each time you change direction, a new run starts. So, if a path changes direction four times, that means there are five runs in total. Because each direction change marks the end of one run and the start of another. So, starting with the initial direction, each change adds another run.

So, the number of runs is four plus one, which is five. So, the path is divided into five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves.

Now, these runs can be either all right moves or all up moves. So, the path alternates between right and up runs. So, the first run can be either right or up, and then it alternates.

Wait, but do the runs alternate strictly, or can they be in any order? For example, can you have a run of right, then right again without changing direction? No, because each change of direction creates a new run. So, if you have a run of right, then another run must be up, then right, etc. So, the runs alternate between right and up.

So, the path consists of five runs, alternating between right and up. Since the starting direction can be either right or up, we have two cases: starting with right or starting with up.

Each run must consist of at least one step. Because you can't have a run of zero steps. So, each run has at least one step. Now, we need to distribute the total right steps and
