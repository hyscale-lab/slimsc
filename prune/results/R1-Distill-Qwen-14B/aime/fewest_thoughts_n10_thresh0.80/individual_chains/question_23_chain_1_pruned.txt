Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, hold on, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think—no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Hmm, wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, no, wait, I think I confused it with a kite. Let me recall: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. Because a rhombus is a type of kite where all sides are equal, and in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular if it's a rhombus. So, yes, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.

So, in our case, the rhombus ABCD has diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, if A is (x, y), then the opposite vertex C will be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D will be (-u, -v). 

But since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are equal. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, their slopes should be negative reciprocals of each other.

Wait, but since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and are perpendicular, maybe we can parameterize the points on the hyperbola such that the diagonals satisfy these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that since the points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Let me denote the coordinates:

Let’s say point A is (x1, y1), then point C is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, point B is (x2, y2), so point D is (-x2, -y2).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe we can use the property that the product of their slopes is -1.

But maybe another approach: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, which is the origin here, so that's already satisfied.

So, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.

Let me compute the slopes of AC and BD.

But wait, AC is from (x1, y1) to (-x1, -y1), so its slope is ( -y1 - y1 ) / ( -x1 - x1 ) = (-2y1)/(-2x1) = y1/x1.

Similarly, BD is from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2), so its slope is (-y2 - y2)/(-x2 - x2) = (-2y2)/(-2x2) = y2/x2.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So,

(y1/x1) * (y2/x2) = -1.

That's one equation.

Now, since A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy:

x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1,

x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1.

So, that's two equations.

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal. Let's compute AB²:

AB² = (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)².

Similarly, BC² = ( -x1 - x2 )² + ( -y1 - y2 )².

Since AB = BC, AB² = BC²:

(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)² = (-x1 - x2)² + (-y1 - y2)².

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)² = (x2² - 2x1x2 + x1²) + (y2² - 2y1y2 + y1²).

Right side: (-x1 - x2)² + (-y1 - y2)² = (x1² + 2x1x2 + x2²) + (y1² + 2y1y2 + y2²).

Set them equal:

(x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1²) = (x1² + 2x1x2 + x2² + y1² + 2y1y2 + y2²).

Subtract the right side from both sides:

(-2x1x2 - 2y1y2) - (2x1x2 + 2y1y2) = 0.

Which simplifies to:

-4x1x2 -4y1y2 = 0.

Divide both sides by -4:

x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

So, that's another equation: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

Wait, that might be useful.

So, to recap, we have the following equations:

1. (y1/x1)*(y2/x2) = -1 => y1y2 = -x1x2.

2. x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

From equation 1: y1y2 = -x1x2.

Substitute into equation 2: x1x2 + (-x1x2) = 0 => 0=0.

Hmm, so equation 2 is redundant given equation 1. So, that doesn't give us new information.

So, perhaps I need another condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the vectors. Let me consider the vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since the rhombus is formed by points A, B, C, D, with C and D being the other points.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so OA ⊥ OB.

Wait, because the diagonals are AC and BD, and their midpoints are O. So, OA and OC are vectors along diagonal AC, and OB and OD are vectors along diagonal BD.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, OA and OB must be perpendicular vectors. So, their dot product is zero.

So, OA · OB = 0 => x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

Which is the same as equation 2. So, that's consistent.

So, now, we have that x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

But since both A and B lie on the hyperbola, we have x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1 and x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1.

So, we have three equations:

1. x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

2. x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1.

3. x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1.

Hmm, so perhaps I can parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola such that their dot product is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the parametric equations of the hyperbola. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, a parametrization can be (
