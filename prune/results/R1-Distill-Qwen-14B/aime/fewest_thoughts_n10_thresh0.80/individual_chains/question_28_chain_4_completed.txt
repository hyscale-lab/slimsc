--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

inradius = 3 * (volume) / (surface area)

Wait, no, actually, in 3D, the formula is similar to the 2D case. For a tetrahedron, the inradius r is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. But wait, is it 3 times the volume over the total surface area? Let me think. In 2D, the inradius is area / semiperimeter. In 3D, it should be 3 times volume divided by the total surface area. Yeah, that sounds right because volume is like the 3D area, and surface area is like the perimeter in 2D.

So, my plan is to calculate the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, then compute r = 3V / S.

But how do I find the volume? Hmm. The tetrahedron has all opposite edges equal, which might mean it's a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure of the exact term. But perhaps I can use coordinates to compute the volume.

Yes, using coordinates might be the way to go. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that calculations are easier.

Let me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Then, I can place vertex B at (a, 0, 0), vertex C at (0, b, 0), and vertex D at (0, 0, c). Wait, but in this case, the opposite edges AB and CD would be sqrt(a² + 0 + 0) = a and sqrt(0 + b² + c²) respectively. But in our case, AB = CD = sqrt(41). So, a = sqrt(41), and sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(41). So, b² + c² = 41.

Similarly, AC is sqrt(80). AC is from (0,0,0) to (0, b, 0), so its length is b. So, b = sqrt(80). Wait, no: AC is from (0,0,0) to (0, b, 0), so length is b. So, b = sqrt(80). Wait, but the given length is sqrt(80), so yes, that works.

Similarly, BD is sqrt(80). BD is from (a, 0, 0) to (0, 0, c). So, the distance is sqrt((a)^2 + (0)^2 + (c)^2) = sqrt(a² + c²). So, sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80). So, a² + c² = 80.

But earlier, from AB = sqrt(41), a = sqrt(41), so a² = 41. And from CD = sqrt(41), sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(41), so b² + c² = 41.

We have:

From AC: b = sqrt(80), so b² = 80.

From BD: a² + c² = 80. But a² is 41, so 41 + c² = 80 ⇒ c² = 39 ⇒ c = sqrt(39).

So, now let's check CD. CD is from (0, b, 0) to (0, 0, c). The distance is sqrt((0)^2 + (b)^2 + (c)^2) = sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(80 + 39) = sqrt(119). Wait, but CD should be sqrt(41). That's a problem.

Hmm, that doesn't match up. So maybe my coordinate system is not appropriate. I assumed A at (0,0,0), B at (a,0,0), C at (0,b,0), D at (0,0,c). But with this setup, CD is sqrt(b² + c²), which comes out to sqrt(80 + 39) = sqrt(119), but in the problem CD is sqrt(41). So that's a conflict. So, my coordinate system doesn't work.

I need a different approach. Maybe using vectors or another coordinate system. Alternatively, perhaps this tetrahedron is a kind of "equifacial" tetrahedron where all faces are congruent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, it might be a kind of "edge-transitive" tetrahedron. Maybe it's a tetrahedron that can be inscribed in a rectangular box? I think I remember something about that.

Yes, for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be embedded in a box such that each edge corresponds to a face diagonal of the box. So, perhaps I can model this tetrahedron as formed by connecting opposite edges of a rectangular box.

Let me try that approach. Let me denote the edges of the box as x, y, z. Then, the opposite edges of the tetrahedron would be the face diagonals.

In this setup, the edges of the tetrahedron correspond to the face diagonals of the box. So, each pair of opposite edges of the tetrahedron would be the diagonals of opposite faces of the box.

Given that, let's assign the edges:

- AB and CD are face diagonals on opposite faces, so their lengths would be sqrt(x² + y²) and sqrt(y² + z²). But in our problem, AB and CD are both sqrt(41). So, sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41) and sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(41).

Similarly, AC and BD are face diagonals on another pair of opposite faces. So, sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80) and sqrt(z² + y²) = sqrt(80). Wait, no, because in the box, each face has two diagonals. So, perhaps AC is sqrt(x² + z²) and BD is sqrt(y² + z²). But wait, we have AC = sqrt(80), BD = sqrt(80). So, both diagonals on the same axis? Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Wait, maybe the edges are as follows:

Let me think of the tetrahedron as having vertices at (0,0,0), (x,0,0), (0,y,0), and (0,0,z). Then, the opposite edges would be:

AB: from (0,0,0) to (x,0,0): length x.

Wait, no, that's not correct because if I do it that way, the edges of the tetrahedron would be x, y, z, which are the edges of the box. But in our problem, the edges of the tetrahedron are face diagonals. So perhaps AB is the diagonal of the face in the x-y plane, so length sqrt(x² + y²). Similarly, CD would be another diagonal of the opposite face, which would also be sqrt(y² + z²) or something else.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign the edges as follows:

Let me denote the edges of the box as a, b, c. Then, the edges of the tetrahedron would be the face diagonals. So:

AB: sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41)

AC: sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80)

AD: sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89)

Wait, wait. Let me see: If the tetrahedron is formed by the four vertices of the box (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c), then the edges of the tetrahedron would be:

AB: from (0,0,0) to (a,0,0) → length a

AC: from (0,0,0) to (0,b,0) → length b

AD: from (0,0,0) to (0,0,c) → length c

But in this case, the opposite edges of the tetrahedron would be:

AB and CD: CD is from (a,0,0) to (0,b,0) → sqrt(a² + b²)

AC and BD: BD is from (a,0,0) to (0,0,c) → sqrt(a² + c²)

AD and BC: BC is from (0,b,0) to (0,0,c) → sqrt(b² + c²)

Wait, that's better. So in the problem, the opposite edges are equal. So, AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC.

Given that, AB is a, CD is sqrt(a² + b²). But according to the problem, AB = CD. So, a = sqrt(a² + b²). Hmm, that can't be because sqrt(a² + b²) is bigger than a. So, that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I assigned the edges incorrectly. Maybe the edges of the tetrahedron aren't the edges of the box, but the face diagonals. Let me try again.

Let me model the tetrahedron as a "space diagonal" tetrahedron. So, the vertices are at (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c). Then, the edges of the tetrahedron are the face diagonals.

Wait, the edges of the tetrahedron would be the distances between these four points. So, AB is from (0,0,0) to (a,0,0): length a.

AC is from (0,0,0) to (0,b,0): length b.

AD is from (0,0,0) to (0,0,c): length c.

BC is from (a,0,0) to (0,b,0): sqrt(a² + b²).

BD is from (a,0,0) to (0,0,c): sqrt(a² + c²).

CD is from (0,b,0) to (0,0,c): sqrt(b² + c²).

In the problem, AB = CD = sqrt(41), so a = sqrt(b² + c²).

Similarly, AC = BD: b = sqrt(a² + c²).

AD = BC: c = sqrt(a² + b²).

Wait, let's write down these equations:

1. a = sqrt(b² + c²) → a² = b² + c².

2. b = sqrt(a² + c²) → b² = a² + c².

3. c = sqrt(a² + b²) → c² = a² + b².

Wait, that can't be. Because from equation 1: a² = b² + c².

From equation 2: b² = a² + c².

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2: b² = (b² + c²) + c² → b² = b² + 2c² → 0 = 2c² → c²=0 → c=0. That's impossible because c is a length.

So, this approach leads to a contradiction. So, maybe the way I'm assigning the coordinates is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the edges of the tetrahedron are not the face diagonals but the space diagonals of the box. Let me try that.

If the tetrahedron's edges are the space diagonals of a box with edges a, b, c, then each edge of the tetrahedron would be sqrt(a² + b² + c²). But in our problem, the edges are different, so that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps this tetrahedron is "equifacial," meaning all its faces are congruent. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a "isosceles tetrahedron," where all opposite edges are equal.

Yes, I think such a tetrahedron is called isosceles, where all opposite edges are equal. For such a tetrahedron, the volume can be computed using the formula involving the lengths of the edges.

I found a formula online before (but since I can't look it up now, I need to recall) that for an isosceles tetrahedron, the volume V can be calculated using the formula:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps using Heron's formula in 3D.

Wait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is orthocentric, which means that all four altitudes intersect at a single point. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, allowing us to compute the volume via coordinates.

Wait, maybe it's better to try to assign coordinates in a different way. Let me try to place the tetrahedron such that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin or something.

Wait, let's consider that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the midpoints of the three pairs of opposite edges are the same point. So, that point is the centroid, and perhaps the incenter as well.

But maybe I can model the tetrahedron as having its centroid at the origin, with coordinates assigned symmetrically.

Let me denote the coordinates as follows:

Let A = (x, y, z)

B = (-x, -y, z)

C = (-x, y, -z)

D = (x, -y, -z)

This way, the midpoints of AB, AC, AD, etc., are all at the origin. So, this might make the opposite edges equal.

Let me check the distances:

AB: distance between (x,y,z) and (-x,-y,z). So, sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 ) = 2 sqrt(x² + y²). Similarly, CD is between (-x,y,-z) and (x,-y,-z): sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 ) = same as AB. So, AB = CD.

Similarly, AC is between (x,y,z) and (-x,y,-z): sqrt( (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 ) = 2 sqrt(x² + z²). Similarly, BD is between (-x,-y,z) and (x,-y,-z): sqrt( (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 ) = same as AC. So, AC = BD.

Similarly, AD is between (x,y,z) and (x,-y,-z): sqrt(0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 ) = 2 sqrt(y² + z²). Similarly, BC is between (-x,-y,z) and (-x,y,-z): sqrt(0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 ) = same as AD. So, AD = BC.

Perfect! So, this coordinate system satisfies that opposite edges are equal.

Given that, the lengths are:

AB = CD = 2 sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41). So,

2 sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41) → sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41)/2 → x² + y² = 41/4.

Similarly, AC = BD = 2 sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80). So,

2 sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80) → sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80)/2 → x² + z² = 80/4 = 20.

And AD = BC = 2 sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(89). So,

2 sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(89) → sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(89)/2 → y² + z² = 89/4.

So now, we have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41/4.

2. x² + z² = 20.

3. y² + z² = 89/4.

We can solve these equations for x², y², z².

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = 20 - 41/4.

So, z² - y² = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.

From equation 3, y² + z² = 89/4.

So, now I have:

z² - y² = 39/4,

z² + y² = 89/4.

Adding these two equations:

2 z² = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 → z² = 16 → z = 4.

Subtracting the two equations:

2 y² = (89 - 39)/4 = 50/4 = 25/2 → y² = 25/4 → y = 5/2.

From equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4 → x² + 25/4 = 41/4 → x² = 16/4 = 4 → x = 2.

So, x = 2, y = 5/2, z = 4.

So, the coordinates of the tetrahedron are:

A = (2, 5/2, 4)

B = (-2, -5/2, 4)

C = (-2, 5/2, -4)

D = (2, -5/2, -4)

Now, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume.

The volume V of a tetrahedron with vertices at A, B, C, D can be calculated using the scalar triple product formula:

V = | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6

First, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

But wait, let me make sure: in the formula, it's the vectors from a common vertex. Let's take vertex A as the common point.

So, vectors:

AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)

AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)

AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)

Now, compute the cross product AC × AD.

Let me denote AC = (-4, 0, -8) and AD = (0, -5, -8).

The cross product is:

|i   j   k |
|-4   0   -8|
|0   -5   -8|

= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i component: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40

j component: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 - 0] = -32

k component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20

So, AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, compute AB · (AC × AD):

AB = (-4, -5, 0)

Dot product with (-40, -32, 20):

= (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320

So, V = |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.

So, volume V = 160/3.

Now, I need the total surface area S.

Each face is a triangle. Since all opposite edges are equal, I think all faces are congruent, but let me verify.

Wait, let me calculate the area of one face and then multiply by 4 if they're all congruent.

Let me compute the area of face ABC.

Wait, face ABC: points A, B, C.

Compute vectors AB and AC.

AB = (-4, -5, 0) as before.

AC = (-4, 0, -8) as before.

The area is (1/2) |AB × AC|.

Compute AB × AC.

AB = (-4, -5, 0)

AC = (-4, 0, -8)

Cross product:

|i   j   k|
|-4   -5   0|
|-4   0   -8|

= i*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))

Compute each component:

i: 40 - 0 = 40

j: - [32 - 0] = -32

k: 0 - 20 = -20

So, AB × AC = (40, -32, -20)

The magnitude is sqrt(40² + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).

Simplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024.

3024 ÷ 16 = 189.

So, sqrt(3024) = 4 sqrt(189).

189 factors into 9 * 21 = 9 * 3 *7.

So, sqrt(189) = 3 sqrt(21).

Thus, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21).

So, the area of face ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).

Similarly, since all faces are congruent (because the tetrahedron is isohedral), each face has area 6 sqrt(21). So, total surface area S = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).

Wait, but wait a minute, is that correct? Because all faces might not necessarily be congruent. Let me check another face to be sure.

Let's compute the area of face ABD: points A, B, D.

Vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AD = (0, -5, -8).

Compute AB × AD.

AB = (-4, -5, 0)

AD = (0, -5, -8)

Cross product:

|i   j   k|
|-4   -5   0|
|0   -5   -8|

= i*(-5*(-8) - 0*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - (-5)*0 )

Compute each component:

i: 40 - 0 = 40

j: - [32 - 0] = -32

k: 20 - 0 = 20

So, AB × AD = (40, -32, 20)

The magnitude is sqrt(40² + (-32)^2 +20²) = sqrt(1600 +1024 +400) = sqrt(3024) same as before.

So, the area is (1/2)*sqrt(3024) = 6 sqrt(21). So yes, each face is congruent, so the total surface area is indeed 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).

So, now, we have V = 160/3 and S = 24 sqrt(21).

But wait, the formula for inradius is r = 3V / S.

Wait, let me double-check: In 3D, for a tetrahedron, inradius r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. Yes, that's correct.

So, plugging in:

r = (3 * (160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (20) / (3 sqrt(21)).

To rationalize the denominator:

r = (20) / (3 sqrt(21)) * (sqrt(21)/sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.

Simplify numerator and denominator: 20 and 63 have no common factors, so this is the simplest form.

So, r = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.

Expressed as m sqrt(n)/p, m=20, n=21, p=63.

But wait, check if m and p are coprime. 20 and 63: factors of 20 are 2,4,5,10,20; factors of 63 are 3,7,9,21,63. No common factors, so yes, they are coprime. Also, n=21 is square-free (21=3*7, no squares).

So, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63. So, m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum m + n + p = 20 +21 +63=104.

Wait, but wait, hold on: I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the cross product for the area of the face. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed AB × AC earlier, I got (40, -32, -20), and its magnitude was sqrt(40² + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024). Then, 3024 factors: 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 *7. So, sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*9*21)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21). Therefore, the area is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21). So that's correct.

Wait, but 3024 is 16 * 189, right? 16*189=3024. So, sqrt(3024)=4 sqrt(189). Wait, but 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(189)=3 sqrt(21). So, sqrt(3024)=4*3 sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21). Correct.

Wait, but 4*3 is 12, yes. So, yes, the area is 6 sqrt(21). So, that's correct.

So, inradius r = 3V/S = 3*(160/3)/(24 sqrt(21)) )= 160/(24 sqrt(21)) )= 20/(3 sqrt(21)) = 20 sqrt(21)/63. Correct.

Thus, the answer is 20 +21 +63=104.

Wait, but I thought the formula was r = 3V / S? Let me confirm.

Wait, in 3D, the formula for the inradius is r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. So, that's correct. So, yes, that's how I got r = 20 sqrt(21)/63.

But wait, I just realized that the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each face, which is what the problem is asking for. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure that the incenter is indeed the point equidistant to all faces in a tetrahedron. Yes, in a tetrahedron, the inradius is the radius of the inscribed sphere tangent to all four faces, and the incenter is the center of that sphere. So, yes, the distance is r = 3V/S.

Therefore, the answer should be 20 +21 +63=104.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me retrace the steps.

1. Assigned coordinates correctly, solved for x, y, z, got x=2, y=5/2, z=4.

2. Computed vectors AB, AC, AD correctly.

3. Cross product AC × AD: correct, got (-40, -32, 20).

4. Dot product with AB: (-4, -5, 0) · (-40, -32, 20) = 160 + 160 +0=320. So, V=320/6=160/3.

5. Surface area: each face area 6 sqrt(21), total 24 sqrt(21).

6. r=3V/S= 3*(160/3)/(24 sqrt(21))=160/(24 sqrt(21))=20/(3 sqrt(21))=20 sqrt(21)/63.

7. Sum m +n +p=20+21+63=104.

Yes, everything seems consistent.


To solve the problem, we consider a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with given edge lengths: \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\). We aim to find the distance from the incenter \(I\) to each face, expressed in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\), and then compute \(m + n + p\).

### Step 1: Assigning Coordinates
We model the tetrahedron using a coordinate system where the vertices are symmetrically placed:
- \(A = (2, \frac{5}{2}, 4)\)
- \(B = (-2, -\frac{5}{2}, 4)\)
- \(C = (-2, \frac{5}{2}, -4)\)
- \(D = (2, -\frac{5}{2}, -4)\)

This ensures that the opposite edges are equal, satisfying the given conditions.

### Step 2: Calculating the Volume
Using the scalar triple product, we calculate the volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron:
- Vectors from \(A\): \(\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\), \(\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\), \(\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)\)
- Cross product \(\overrightarrow{AC} \times \overrightarrow{AD} = (-40, -32, 20)\)
- Dot product \(\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot (\overrightarrow{AC} \times \overrightarrow{AD}) = 320\)
- Volume \(V = \frac{1}{6} |320| = \frac{160}{3}\)

### Step 3: Calculating the Surface Area
Each face of the tetrahedron is congruent. We compute the area of one face and multiply by 4:
- Vectors \(\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\) and \(\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\)
- Cross product \(\overrightarrow{AB} \times \overrightarrow{AC} = (40, -32, -20)\)
- Magnitude of the cross product: \(\sqrt{40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2} = 12\sqrt{21}\)
- Area of one face: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12\sqrt{21} = 6\sqrt{21}\)
- Total surface area \(S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}\)

### Step 4: Calculating the Inradius
The inradius \(r\) is given by \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\):
- \(r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\)

### Step 5: Simplifying and Summing
The distance is expressed as \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\), where \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\). These values satisfy the conditions: \(m\) and \(p\) are coprime, and \(n\) is square-free.

Thus, \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

### Final Answer
\boxed{104}
