Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite typically involves moving right and up. So, in an 8x8 grid, to go from (0,0) to (8,8), you need 8 right moves and 8 up moves. The total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time for either right or up. That's C(16,8), which is 12870. But this problem is more specific.

Wait, the problem specifies that the paths change direction exactly four times. So, how does that work? Let me think. Each direction change would be from moving right to up or up to right. So, if you change direction four times, how does that break down in terms of runs of right and up moves?

Let me model this. Suppose I have a sequence of moves, each either right (R) or up (U). The path starts with either R or U. Each time the direction changes, it alternates between R and U. So, if a path changes direction four times, how many segments (or runs) of R and U does it have?

Let's see. If the path starts with R, then the directions would go R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U. That would be four direction changes, resulting in five segments. Wait, no. Wait, each direction change increments the number of segments by one. So starting with R, one change takes it to U (two segments), another change back to R (three), and so on. So four changes would mean five segments. But since the path starts with either R or U, the number of segments depends on the starting direction.

Wait, actually, let's clarify. Each direction change adds one segment. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. So, if the path changes direction exactly four times, it has five segments. So, if it starts with R, the sequence
