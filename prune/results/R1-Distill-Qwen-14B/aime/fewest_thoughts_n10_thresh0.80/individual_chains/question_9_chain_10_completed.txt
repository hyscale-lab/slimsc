Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, alright, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember some logarithm properties. The logarithm log_b(a) is equal to (ln a)/(ln b), right? So maybe I can use that to rewrite both equations in terms of natural logarithms. Let me write down the two given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Let me start with the first equation. Using the property that log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a), this simplifies the first equation. So, log_x(y^x) becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I think I can express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other. Remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me let log_y(x) = k. Then log_x(y) = 1/k.

Substituting into the first equation: x * (1/k) = 10.

And the second equation becomes 4y * k = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x / k = 10 => x = 10k
2. 4y * k = 10 => y = (10)/(4k) = (5)/(2k)

So now I have x and y in terms of k. But I need to find a relationship between x and y to find k.

I also remember that log_y(x) = k. Let's write that in terms of natural logs: log_y(x) = (ln x)/(ln y) = k.

So, (ln x) = k * (ln y).

But from above, x = 10k and y = 5/(2k). Let's substitute these into this equation.

So, ln(10k) = k * ln(5/(2k)).

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can expand the logs. Let's do that.

ln(10k) = ln(10) + ln(k)

Similarly, ln(5/(2k)) = ln(5) - ln(2k) = ln(5) - (ln 2 + ln k).

So, putting it back into the equation:

ln(10) + ln(k) = k * [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(k)]

Let me write this out:

ln(10) + ln(k) = k * [ln(5) - ln(2)] - k * ln(k)

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have a straightforward algebraic solution. Maybe I can rearrange terms to see if I can find a substitution or something.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

ln(10) + ln(k) + k * ln(k) - k * [ln(5) - ln(2)] = 0

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me compute the constants first. Let's compute ln(10), ln(5), and ln(2):

ln(10) ≈ 2.302585
ln(5) ≈ 1.609438
ln(2) ≈ 0.693147

So, ln(5) - ln(2) ≈ 1.609438 - 0.693147 ≈ 0.916291.

So, the equation becomes:

2.302585 + ln(k) + k * ln(k) - k * 0.916291 ≈ 0

Let me simplify the terms:

2.302585 + ln(k) + k * ln(k) - 0.916291 * k ≈ 0

I can write this as:

[ln(k) + k * ln(k)] + [2.302585 - 0.916291 * k] ≈ 0

Hmm, perhaps factor out ln(k) from the first group:

ln(k) * (1 + k) + [2.302585 - 0.916291 * k] ≈ 0

So,

ln(k) * (1 + k) ≈ 0.916291 * k - 2.302585

This still looks complicated, but maybe I can make a substitution. Let me let t = k. Then, the equation becomes:

ln(t) * (1 + t) ≈ 0.916291 * t - 2.302585

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Another approach might be to consider if k is an integer or a simple fraction, maybe I can guess and check.

Wait, let's see, x and y are both greater than 1, so k = log_y(x) must be positive. Also, since x = 10k and y = 5/(2k), both x and y must be greater than 1, so:

10k > 1 => k > 1/10 = 0.1

5/(2k) > 1 => 5/(2k) > 1 => 2k < 5 => k < 5/2 = 2.5

So k is between 0.1 and 2.5.

Let me try k=1:

Plug into the equation: ln(1) * (1 +1) = 0, while 0.916291*1 -2.302585 ≈ -1.3863. So 0 ≈ -1.3863? No.

k=2:

ln(2)*(1+2) ≈ 0.6931 * 3 ≈ 2.0794

0.916291*2 -2.302585 ≈ 1.832582 - 2.302585 ≈ -0.470003

So 2.0794 ≈ -0.4700? No.

k=1.5:

ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055, so 0.4055*(1+1.5)=0.4055*2.5≈1.01375

0.916291*1.5 ≈ 1.374437; 1.374437 -2.302585 ≈ -0.928148

So 1.01375 ≈ -0.9281? No.

k=0.5:

ln(0.5)≈-0.6931, so (-0.6931)*(1+0.5)= (-0.6931)*1.5≈-1.03965

0.916291*0.5≈0.4581455; 0.4581455 -2.302585≈-1.84444

So equation is -1.03965 ≈ -1.84444? Not close.

k=1. Let's check the previous attempt.

Alternatively, maybe the equation is solvable with substitution.

Let me write the equation again:

ln(10k) = k * ln(5/(2k))

Let me substitute m = k, so:

ln(10m) = m * ln(5/(2m))

Hmm. Maybe express this as:

ln(10) + ln(m) = m [ ln(5) - ln(2m) ]

Which is:

ln(10) + ln(m) = m [ ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(m) ]

So,

ln(10) + ln(m) = m ln(5) - m ln(2) - m ln(m)

Rearranging,

ln(10) + ln(m) + m ln(m) - m ln(5) + m ln(2) = 0

Wait, same as before.

Another approach: Maybe assume that k is a rational number, perhaps 2, or 1/2, but we saw k=1,2,1.5,0.5 don't work.

Alternatively, perhaps take exponentials on both sides.

Starting from ln(10k) = k ln(5/(2k)).

Exponentiating both sides:

10k = (5/(2k))^k

So,

10k = (5/(2k))^k

Let me write 5/(2k) as (5/2) * (1/k). So,

10k = [ (5/2) * (1/k) ]^k = (5/2)^k * (1/k)^k = (5/2)^k / k^k

So,

10k = (5/2)^k / k^k

Multiply both sides by k^k:

10k * k^k = (5/2)^k

Hmm, that's 10k^{k+1} = (5/2)^k

Maybe take natural logs again:

ln(10) + (k +1) ln(k) = k ln(5/2)

Which is,

ln(10) + (k +1) ln(k) = k (ln5 - ln2)

Wait, but this is the same as the earlier equation we had. So, this approach just brings us back.

Hmm, so maybe we need to solve this numerically.

Let me consider f(k) = ln(10k) - k * ln(5/(2k)) = 0

We can use methods like Newton-Raphson to approximate k.

But since it's a bit involved, perhaps I can make a substitution.

Let me let k = 2. Wait, no, k=2 didn't work earlier.

Alternatively, maybe k= sqrt(something), but not sure.

Wait, let me think about the original equations again.

From the first equation, x = 10k

From the second, y = 5/(2k)

So, x = 10k and y = 5/(2k)

So, x * y = (10k) * (5/(2k)) = (10*5)/(2) * (k/k) = 50/2 * 1 =25.

Wait, wait a minute! That seems too straightforward. Did I do that right?

Let me compute x times y.

x =10k, y=5/(2k)

So, x * y = (10k) * (5/(2k)) = (10 *5)/(2) * (k/k) = 50/2 * 1 =25.

Wow, so xy is 25, regardless of the value of k? So, regardless of what k is, as long as x and y satisfy those two logarithmic equations, their product is 25.

Wait, that's actually brilliant. I didn't have to go through all the complicated logarithmic equations because the product simplifies nicely.

So, the answer is 25.

Wait, but let me confirm that. Let me see: x =10k, y=5/(2k). Multiply them: x*y = (10k)*(5/(2k)) = (10*5)/(2) * (k/k) = 50/2 * 1 =25. Yep, that's correct.

So, regardless of the value of k, the product xy is always 25. Therefore, the answer is 25.

I think I overcomplicated it by trying to solve for k, but it turns out the product doesn't depend on k at all. So, xy =25.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( xy \) is \boxed{25}.


Given the equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

We start by using the properties of logarithms to rewrite these equations. 

For the first equation, we use the property \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\):

\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

For the second equation, we similarly rewrite it:

\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Next, we use the change of base formula and properties of logarithms. Let \(k = \log_y(x)\). Then, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{k}\). Substituting these into the equations, we get:

1. \(x \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 10 \implies x = 10k\)
2. \(4y \cdot k = 10 \implies y = \frac{10}{4k} = \frac{5}{2k}\)

We then find the product \(xy\):

\[
xy = (10k) \left(\frac{5}{2k}\right) = \frac{10k \cdot 5}{2k} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
