Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down the given equations first to make it clearer. The first equation is:

log_x(y^x) = 10

And the second equation is:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Alright, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help here. One key property is that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So maybe I can use that to simplify both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. So,

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait a second, log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x. There's another logarithm property that says log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me write that down.

So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say, letâ€™s let a = log_y(x). Then, log_x(y) would be 1/a.

Substituting back into the first equation, we have:

x * (1/a) = 10.

So, x / a = 10. Which implies that x = 10a.

Okay, got that. Now let's look at the second equation:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

But wait, log_y(x) is just a, as I defined earlier. So,

4y * a = 10.

So, 4a y = 10.

From the first equation, I have x = 10a. Maybe I can express y in terms of a as well from this second equation.

Let me rearrange 4a y = 10:

y = 10 / (4a) = (5) / (2a).

So, y = 5/(2a).

Now, I have expressions for both x and y in terms of a. Let's write them down:

x = 10a,

y = 5/(2a).

Hmm, but I need another equation because right now I have two variables, x and y, both expressed in terms of a. But I know that x and y are related through their logarithms, so perhaps I can find another relationship.

Wait, earlier I set a = log_y(x). Let me write that again:

a = log_y(x).

But log_y(x) is the logarithm of x with base y, which is equal to log(x)/log(y), if I convert it to natural logarithms or any common base, say base 10. But maybe I can express this in terms of x and y.

Alternatively, since a = log_y(x), then by definition, y^a = x.

Yes, because if log_y(x) = a, then y^a = x.

So, y^a = x.

But I have x =10a and y =5/(2a). So, substituting these into y^a = x:

(5/(2a))^a = 10a.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate it.

Let me write that equation again:

(5/(2a))^a = 10a.

Take natural logarithm on both sides to make it easier to handle exponents.

ln[(5/(2a))^a] = ln(10a).

Using the power rule for logarithms, the left side becomes a * ln(5/(2a)).

So,

a * ln(5/(2a)) = ln(10a).

Hmm, this equation has a in both the base and the exponent. It's a transcendental equation, which might be difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe I can try to find a substitution or see if a is a nice number.

Let me see if I can express the left side in another way.

First, let's expand ln(5/(2a)):

ln(5) - ln(2a) = ln(5) - (ln 2 + ln a).

So, the left side becomes:

a [ln5 - ln2 - ln a].

So, the equation is:

a (ln5 - ln2 - ln a) = ln10a.

Again, ln10a = ln10 + ln a.

So, substituting that in:

a (ln5 - ln2 - ln a) = ln10 + ln a.

Hmm, let's collect terms:

a (ln5 - ln2 - ln a) - ln a = ln10.

Factor out ln a:

a (ln5 - ln2) - a ln a - ln a = ln10.

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, maybe I can let t = a, and then write the equation as:

t (ln5 - ln2 - ln t) = ln10 + ln t.

So, t (C - ln t) = D + ln t, where C = ln5 - ln2 and D = ln10.

Hmm, this is still complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I
