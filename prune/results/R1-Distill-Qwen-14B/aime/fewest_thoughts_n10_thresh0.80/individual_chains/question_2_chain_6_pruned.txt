Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let's see, the points given are O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and point B is on the y-axis at sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. 

The family of segments F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ has length 1, P is (p, 0), and Q is (0, q), such that sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1. 

Then, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, not equal to A or B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, point C is on AB, and it's only on AB from family F, and not on any other segment from F. I need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

Hmm. So, first, maybe I should find the equation of the line AB. Let me find the coordinates of A and B. A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the line AB can be found using these two points. Let's calculate the slope first. Slope m = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). 

So, the equation of AB can be written in point-slope form. Let's use point A(1/2, 0). So, y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation for AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, any point C on AB can be parameterized. Maybe I can represent point C as a point moving along AB. Let's let t be a parameter between 0 and 1, where t=0 is at A and t=1 is at B. So, the coordinates of C can be written as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) * t

Wait, let me check that. When t=0, x should be 1/2, y=0, which is correct for point A. When t=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. So, yes, that seems right.

So, point C is ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t) for t in [0,1].

Now, the point C is on AB, and we need to find C such that it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for point C, if we can find a t such that it's only on AB from F and not on any other PQ, then that C is the one we need.

Alternatively, maybe the point C is the point where the envelope of the family F touches the line AB at only one point, which is C. So, the envelope of the family of lines PQ is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. The point C is the point where this envelope is tangent to AB, so AB is tangent to the envelope at C, and C is the only point shared between AB and the envelope.

So, perhaps I need to find the envelope of the family F, then find where AB is tangent to this envelope. The point of tangency would be C.

So, how do I find the envelope of the family F?

Each segment PQ has endpoints P(p,0) and Q(0,q), with p² + q² =1. So, the equation of line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1, since it's a line intercepting the x-axis at p and y-axis at q. So, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² =1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves. For each curve in the family, the envelope satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero. 

But in this case, the family is parameterized by p (since q can be expressed in terms of p as q = sqrt(1 - p²), but we can also parameterize it using a parameter, say, θ, such that p = cosθ and q = sinθ, since p² + q² =1. So, θ would vary from 0 to π/2, as P moves from (1,0) to (0,1) on the axes.

So, using θ, the equation of PQ is x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1.

So, to find the envelope, we need to find the curves that satisfy both F_θ(x,y) = 0 and dF_θ/dθ = 0.

So, F_θ(x,y) = x / cosθ + y / sinθ -1 = 0

Compute dF_θ/dθ:

dF/dθ = (x sinθ)/cos²θ - (y cosθ)/sin²θ = 0

So, setting this equal to zero:

(x sinθ)/cos²θ - (y cosθ)/sin²θ = 0

Let me rearrange this equation:

(x sinθ)/cos²θ = (y cosθ)/sin²θ

Multiply both sides by cos²θ sin²θ to eliminate denominators:

x sin³θ = y cos³θ

So, x sin³θ = y cos³θ

From the original equation, F_θ = 0:

x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1 => x = cosθ (1 - y / sinθ)

Wait, maybe I can express x and y in terms of θ. Let me try that.

From x sin³θ = y cos³θ, we have:

y = x (sin³θ / cos³θ) = x tan³θ

So, substituting into F_θ:

x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1

Substitute y = x tan³θ:

x / cosθ + (x tan³θ) / sinθ = 1

Simplify tan³θ, which is (sinθ / cosθ)^3 = sin³θ / cos³θ

So,

x / cosθ + x (sin³θ / cos³θ) / sinθ = 1

Simplify denominator:

= x / cosθ + x (sin²θ / cos³θ) =1

Factor x:

x [ 1 / cosθ + sin²θ / cos³θ ] =1

Combine terms:

x [ (cos²θ + sin²θ) / cos³θ ] =1

Since cos²θ + sin²θ =1,

x [1 / cos³θ ] =1

So, x = cos³θ

Then, from y = x tan³θ,

y = cos³θ * (sin³θ / cos³θ ) = sin³θ

So, parametric equations for the envelope are:

x = cos³θ

y = sin³θ

So, the envelope is the astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1. Because if we raise both sides to 2/3,

x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos²θ + sin²θ =1.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Okay, so now, the envelope is an astroid. Now, the line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. I need to find the point C where this line is tangent to the astroid. That point C is the only point shared between AB and the envelope, so it's the point where AB touches the astroid.

To find the tangent point, I can parametrize the astroid as (cos³θ, sin³θ) and find where the line AB is tangent to it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use calculus to find the tangent line to the astroid at a general point and set it equal to AB's equation.

Let me try that.

The astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Let me differentiate implicitly with respect to x to find the slope of the tangent at any point (x,y):

(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0

So,

dy/dx = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3))

So, the slope of the tangent at point (x,y) on the astroid is m = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).

But the line AB has slope m = -sqrt(3). So, set these equal:

- (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) ) = -sqrt(3)

Simplify:

(y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) ) = sqrt(3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(y) / (x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3)

So, y = 3*sqrt(3) x

But, also, the point (x,y) lies on the astroid:

x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1

Substitute y = 3*sqrt(3) x into this:

x^(2/3) + (3*sqrt(3) x)^(2/3) =1

Compute (3*sqrt(3))^(2/3):

3*sqrt(3) is 3^(3/2), so (3^(3/2))^(2/3) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) )=3^1=3.

So, (3*sqrt(3) x)^(2/3) = 3 x^(2/3)

So, equation becomes:

x^(2/3) + 3 x^(2/3) =1 => 4x^(2/3)=1 => x^(2/3)=1/4

So, x = (1/4)^(3/2) = (1/4)^(1.5) = (1/(2^2))^(3/2) = (2^(-2))^(3/2) )=2^(-3)=1/8.

So, x=1/8.

Then, y=3*sqrt(3) x=3*sqrt(3)*(1/8)= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, the point of tangency is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). But wait, we need to verify if this point lies on AB.

Because the astroid is in the first quadrant, and AB is in the first quadrant as well. So, this point should lie on both AB and the astroid.

So, let's check if (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) lies on AB.

Equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Plug in x=1/8:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) )= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

Which matches the y-coordinate. So yes, point C is on AB.

So, OC^2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.

Compute that:

(1/64) + (27/64) = (28)/64 = 7/16.

Wait, 28/64 reduces to 7/16, yes. So, OC^2=7/16.

So, p=7, q=16. So, p+q=23.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

x=1/8, so x²=1/64.

y=3 sqrt(3)/8, so y²= (9*3)/64=27/64.

Sum: 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16. Yes, correct.

So, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.


To solve the problem, we first determine the equation of line \( AB \). Points \( A \) and \( B \) are given as \( \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \) and \( \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \), respectively. The slope of \( AB \) is calculated as \( -\sqrt{3} \), leading to the equation \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

Next, we find the envelope of the family of segments \( \overline{PQ} \). Each segment \( \overline{PQ} \) has endpoints on the axes and a unit length, so their equations are \( \frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1 \) with \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \). Parameterizing with \( p = \cos\theta \) and \( q = \sin\theta \), the equation becomes \( \frac{x}{\cos\theta} + \frac{y}{\sin\theta} = 1 \). 

To find the envelope, we solve the system:
\[
\frac{x}{\cos\theta} + \frac{y}{\sin\theta} = 1,
\]
\[
\frac{x \sin\theta}{\cos^2\theta} - \frac{y \cos\theta}{\sin^2\theta} = 0.
\]
This leads to the parametric equations of the envelope, which forms an astroid \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \).

The line \( AB \) is tangent to this astroid at point \( C \). To find \( C \), we set the slope of the tangent to the astroid equal to the slope of \( AB \), which is \( -\sqrt{3} \). Solving, we find \( C \) at \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

Finally, we calculate \( OC^2 \):
\[
