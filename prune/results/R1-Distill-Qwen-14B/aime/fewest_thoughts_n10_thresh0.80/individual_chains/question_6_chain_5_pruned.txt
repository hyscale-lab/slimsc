Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me write down what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem says:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

So, both f and g are absolute value functions, each subtracting a constant and then taking another absolute value. That usually creates a V-shaped graph, but with these transformations, they might look a bit different.

I think I should first understand what f(x) and g(x) look like on their own. Maybe that will help me figure out the composite functions later.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's break this down. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2. This would shift the graph down by 1/2 unit. But since we're taking the absolute value of that, it will flip any negative parts back up. So, f(x) is the absolute value of |x| - 1/2. 

Let me think about what this looks like. When |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So, f(x) is a V-shape with vertices at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. Wait, no. Let me plot some points.

At x = 0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

At x = 1/2: f(1/2) = | |1/2| - 1/2 | = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.

At x = 1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

Similarly, at x = -1/2: same as x = 1/2, it's 0.

So, f(x) is a graph that has a W shape? Wait, no. Wait, when x is between -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, which is a V upside down, so a peak at (0, 1/2), and at x = ±1/2, it's 0. Then for |x| > 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V shape increasing as x moves away from 0, but starting at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So, f(x) looks like a W, but with the central peak being 1/2, and the valleys at x = ±1/2, y=0.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this. The inner part is |x|, subtract 1/4, then absolute value again.

At x=0: g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4.

At x=1/4: g(1/4) = |1/4 - 1/4| = 0.

At x=1/2: g(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4.

So, similar to f(x), but with different constants. So, g(x) is a V shape with a central peak at (0, 1/4), valleys at x=±1/4, y=0, and then increasing as |x| increases beyond 1/4.

So, now, f(x) and g(x) are both piecewise linear functions with peaks at 0 and valleys at ±1/2 and ±1/4 respectively.

Now, moving on to the composite functions. Let's consider the first one: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the innermost function is sin(2πx). The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 1 because the coefficient is 2π. So, sin(2πx) has a period of 1, going from 0, up to 1 at x=1/4, back to 0 at x=1/2, down to -1 at x=3/4, and back to 0 at x=1. So, it's a sine wave with peaks every 1 unit.

Next, f is applied to this: f(sin(2πx)). So, since f is defined as ||x| - 1/2|, let's substitute x with sin(2πx). So, f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

Let me think about this. Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Then, taking absolute value, f(sin(2πx)) would be:

If |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, then f(...) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2.

If |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, then f(...) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So, f(sin(2πx)) is a function that oscillates, but with a different shape. Let's think about when |sin(2πx)| is greater than or equal to 1/2. That occurs when sin(2πx) is between -1 and -1/2 or between 1/2 and 1. So, the sine function is above 1/2 or below -1/2.

So, in those regions, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2, which would be a V-shape subtracting 1/2. In the regions where |sin(2πx)| is less than 1/2, f(...) is 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|, which is an upside-down V.

So, f(sin(2πx)) will have a more complex waveform, with peaks and valleys.

Then, g is applied to that. So, g(f(sin(2πx))) = || f(sin(2πx)) | - 1/4 |.

Wait, but f(sin(2πx)) is already an absolute value, so f(...) is non-negative. Hence, | f(...) | is just f(...). So, g(f(...)) = | f(...) - 1/4 |.

Since f(...) is non-negative, we can think of this as:

If f(...) >=
