Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, let's understand the problem. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, right? Let's denote them as x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume is xyz. So according to the problem, 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), so the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, which is (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. Therefore, r squared is (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, my goal is to minimize (x² + y² + z²)/4, which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z².

So, I need to find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, how do I approach this? It seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers? Or perhaps there's a way to relate this to symmetric functions.

Wait, since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, maybe the minimal value occurs when x = y = z? But wait, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if a cube can satisfy the given surface area and volume.

If it's a cube, then surface area is 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, so x = 3. Then, the volume would be 3³ = 27, but the volume here is 23, which is less than 27. So a cube isn't the case here. Therefore, the minimal sphere might not correspond to a cube. So, I can't assume x = y = z.

Hmm, okay, so I need to find the minimum of x² + y² + z² given 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23. Maybe I can use substitution or elimination.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz, and Q = xyz. So, according to the problem, 2P = 54, so P = 27, and Q = 23.

I remember that x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + xz) = S² - 2P. Since P is 27, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54. So, minimizing x² + y² + z² is equivalent to minimizing S², since 54 is a constant.

So, if I can find the minimal S², then subtract 54 and divide by 4 to get r².

Alternatively, maybe I can express S in terms of P and Q, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. Let me define f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which I need to minimize. The constraints are g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, the Lagrangian would be L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23).

Taking partial derivatives:

dL/dx = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

dL/dy = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

dL/dz = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54

xyz = 23

Hmm, this gives me a system of equations. Let me write them out:

1) 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz = 0

2) 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz = 0

3) 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy = 0

4) 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54

5) xyz = 23

This seems complicated, but maybe I can find some symmetry or ratios between x, y, z.

Assuming that x, y, z are all different, but perhaps we can find ratios between them.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

[2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz] - [2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz] = 0

Simplify:

2y - 2x - 2λ(x + z - y - z) - μ(xz - yz) = 0

Simplify term by term:

2(y - x) - 2λ(x - y) - μ z(x - y) = 0

Factor out (y - x):

[2 + 2λ + μ z](y - x) = 0

So either y = x, or 2 + 2λ + μ z = 0. Similarly, if I subtract equation 1 from equation 3, I might get another condition.

But if I suppose that x = y = z, we saw earlier that it's not possible because the volume would be 27, not 23. So, perhaps two variables are equal, and the third is different.

Let me assume WLOG that x = y ≠ z. So, let's set x = y = a, and z = b.

Then, the constraints become:

2(a² + ab + ab) = 54 → 2(a² + 2ab) = 54 → a² + 2ab = 27.

And the volume is a² b = 23.

So now, I can express this system with two variables: a and b.

From the volume: a² b = 23 → b = 23 / a².

Substitute into the surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23 / a²) = 27

Simplify:

a² + (46 / a) = 27

Multiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:

a³ + 46 = 27a

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ -27a +46 = 0

Hmm, now I have a cubic equation. Let me try to find rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test a=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 → 8-54= -46 +46=0. Yes, a=2 is a root.

So, we can factor the cubic as (a - 2)(a² + 2a -23) = 0.

So, solutions are a=2, or a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] /2 = [-2 ±4√6]/2 = -1 ±2√6.

Since a is a length, it must be positive. So a=2 or a = -1 +2√6 (approx 3.916). Let's check a=2.

If a=2, then from the volume, b = 23 / (2)^2 = 23/4 = 5.75.

So, x = y =2, z=5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (23/4)^2 = 8 + (529/16) = (128 +529)/16 = 657/16. So, r² is 657/(16*4) = 657/64. Wait, no, wait. Earlier, we have x² + y² + z² = S² -54, which is (x+y+z)^2 -54. Alternatively, in this case, it's just 4 +4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625, which is 657/16.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2P, which is S² -54. So, if I compute it as 657/16, which is approximately 41.0625, then S² = x² + y² + z² +54 = 657/16 + 54 = 657/16 + 864/16 = 1521/16, so S = sqrt(1521/16) = 39/4 =9.75. Which is correct because x + y + z =2 +2 +5.75=9.75.

But wait, we have another possible solution for a: a= -1 + 2√6. Let's compute that.

Compute a= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

Then, b=23/(a²)=23/( (-1 +2√6)^2 ). Let's compute (-1 +2√6)^2:

=1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, b=23/(25 -4√6). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

b=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25 -4√6)(25+4√6)] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529=1/23. So, b=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, x = y = a= -1 +2√6, z= (25 +4√6)/23.

Compute x² + y² + z². Since x=y, it's 2a² + z².

Compute a²: (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, 2a²=2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

z²=( (25 +4√6)/23 )^2= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529 = (721 +200√6)/529.

So, total x² + y² + z²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

This seems messy. Let me convert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6 is -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So, adding all together:

(26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6)/529

Combine like terms:

26450 +721 =27171

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4232 +200)√6= -4032√6

So, numerator is 27171 -4032√6.

Therefore, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hmm, that's approximately:

27171 ≈27171

4032√6≈4032*2.449≈4032*2.4≈9677, so 4032√6≈9871

So, numerator≈27171 -9871≈17300

Denominator=529.

So, approx 17300/529≈32.7.

But earlier, when a=2, x² + y² + z²≈41.06, so this is smaller. So, perhaps this is the minimal value.

Wait, but which one is smaller? Wait, 32.7 is less than 41.06, so this would be a smaller value. So, if x = y = -1 +2√6 and z=(25 +4√6)/23, that gives a smaller x² + y² + z².

So, that would be the minimal value? Or is there a possibility that even smaller exists?

Wait, but in this case, we assumed that x=y, but maybe the minimal occurs when all are different. But handling the general case is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when x=y=z, but as we saw, this doesn't satisfy the volume constraint. So, perhaps the minimal is when two variables are equal, and the third is different.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal is when x=y, as in the above case.

So, let's compute x² + y² + z² for a= -1 +2√6.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly.

Compute numerator: 27171 -4032√6.

Let me check if that's correct.

Wait, 2a² = 2*(25 -4√6) =50 -8√6.

z²= (25 +4√6)^2 /23²= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529=(721 +200√6)/529.

So, 2a² + z²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So, adding:

26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6=26450 +721=27171; -4232√6 +200√6= (-4232 +200)√6= -4032√6.

Thus, numerator=27171 -4032√6.

So, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hmm, I wonder if this can be simplified. Let me see if 27171 and 4032 have a common factor with 529.

Wait, 529 is 23². Let's check if 23 divides 27171 or 4032.

27171 divided by 23: 23*1000=23000. 27171-23000=4171. 23*180=4140. 4171-4140=31. So, 23*1181=27163, which is close but not exact. Wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, 23*1180=23*(1000 +180)=23000 +4140=27140. 27171 -27140=31. So, 27171=23*1180 +31. So, 23 doesn't divide 27171.

Similarly, 4032 divided by 23: 23*175=4025. 4032-4025=7, so remainder 7. So, 4032=23*175 +7. So, 23 doesn't divide 4032 either.

So, the fraction (27171 -4032√6)/529 cannot be simplified further. So, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Wait, but this is a messy expression. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it numerically to see if it's indeed the minimal.

Wait, when I set x=y=a, we found two solutions: a=2 and a= -1 +2√6. The a=2 gives x² + y² + z²=657/16≈41.06, while the a= -1 +2√6 gives x² + y² + z²≈32.7, which is smaller. Therefore, perhaps that's the minimal.

But how do I know that this is indeed the minimal? Maybe the minimal occurs when all x, y, z are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different, which is what I assumed.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of symmetric equations.

Wait, another approach: let me denote variables such that x ≤ y ≤ z.

I need to minimize x² + y² + z², given 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of substitution. Let me set variables as follows.

Let me define u = x + y + z, v = xy + yz + xz =27, w=xyz=23.

I know that for three variables, the relation between u, v, w is that they are the elementary symmetric sums.

But I'm not sure how that helps me. Maybe I can use inequalities.

I recall that for positive real numbers, x² + y² + z² ≥ ( (x + y + z)^2 ) /3 by Cauchy-Schwarz. But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, but in our case, x, y, z are positive real numbers because they are dimensions of a box.

So, x² + y² + z² ≥ (u²)/3.

But we have x² + y² + z² = u² - 2v = u² -54.

So, u² -54 ≥ u²/3.

Multiply both sides by 3: 3u² -162 ≥ u² → 2u² -162 ≥0 → u² ≥81 → u ≥9.

So, the minimal possible u is 9.

Wait, but u is the sum x + y + z.

So, if u can be as small as 9, but let's see if it's possible to reach u=9.

If u=9, then x² + y² + z²=81 -54=27.

But can u=9 with our constraints?

If u=9, then v=27, w=23.

So, the variables x, y, z would be the roots of the equation t³ -9t² +27t -23=0.

Let me try to find if this cubic has positive real roots.

Compute t³ -9t² +27t -23=0.

Testing t=1: 1-9+27-23= -4≠0

t=2:8 -36 +54 -23=3≠0

t=3:27 -81 +81 -23=4≠0

t=4:64 -144 +108 -23=5≠0

t=5:125 -225 +135 -23=12≠0

t=6:216 -324 +162 -23= 216-324= -108 +162=54-23=31≠0

Hmm, maybe it has one real root and two complex roots.

Alternatively, perhaps u cannot be as low as 9. So, maybe the minimal u is larger than 9.

Wait, but how can I find the minimal u?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inequality between the arithmetic mean and geometric mean.

AM ≥ GM: (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3). So, u/3 ≥ (23)^(1/3). Compute cube root of 23≈2.843. So, u ≥3 *2.843≈8.529.

But earlier, from the Cauchy-Schwarz, u must be at least 9. Since 8.529 <9, the minimal u is 9.

But wait, that's conflicting because AM gives a lower bound of ~8.529, but Cauchy-Schwarz gives a lower bound of 9. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the minimal u is 9, as per the Cauchy-Schwarz, but the AM gives a lower bound that is lower, so 9 is larger than the AM lower bound, so it's possible that u cannot be lower than 9.

But in reality, perhaps u can be lower than 9. Hmm, maybe my approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for given v and w, the minimal u² is achieved when x = y = z, but that's not possible here as the volume is 23, which is less than 27.

Wait, but maybe when variables are unequal, the sum could be less than 9?

Wait, I think I need a different approach. Maybe using the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but this time, perhaps assuming that two variables are equal.

Wait, earlier, when I assumed x = y, I found a solution where x = y = -1 +2√6≈3.898, z≈(25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

Wait, but in this case, the sum x + y + z≈3.898 +3.898 +1.513≈9.309, which is more than 9, so u≈9.309.

Earlier, when I tried to get u=9, I saw that the cubic equation didn't have positive real roots. So, perhaps the minimal u is higher than 9.

So, in that case, when x=y= -1 +2√6, u≈9.309, which is higher than 9. So, maybe this is the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a lower u.

Wait, perhaps I can consider using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

Wait, another approach: the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when x, y, z are as close as possible to each other. Since the volume is fixed, making the sides as equal as possible would minimize the sum of squares.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. For a given volume, the shape that minimizes the surface area is the cube. But in our case, the surface area is fixed, and we're given a lower volume, so perhaps making the sides as equal as possible would minimize the sum of squares.

Wait, but in our case, the surface area is fixed at 54, which is higher than the surface area of a cube with volume 23. Wait, no, the surface area would actually be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, given a fixed surface area, the volume is maximized when the shape is a cube. But in our case, the volume is fixed at 23, which is less than the maximal volume for surface area 54 (which would be the cube volume 27). So, perhaps the minimal sum of squares occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible given the constraints.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of substitution.

Let me consider the variables x, y, z, and fix two variables, express the third in terms of the others.

But that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of substitution with two variables.

Wait, let me try to express z in terms of x and y.

From the surface area equation: 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 → xy + yz + xz=27.

So, z(x + y) + xy =27 → z= (27 - xy)/(x + y).

From the volume equation: xyz=23 → x y [(27 -xy)/(x + y)] =23.

Let me denote t = xy. Then, the equation becomes t*(27 - t)/(x + y) =23.

Hmm, but I still have x + y in there, which complicates things.

Wait, maybe I can let s =x + y, and t =xy. Then, z=(27 - t)/s.

So, the volume is t*z=23 → t*(27 - t)/s =23.

Also, from the surface area, we have that:

We already used that, so moving on.

Additionally, x² + y² + z² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy + z² = s² - 2t + z².

But z²= [(27 - t)/s]^2.

So, x² + y² + z² = s² - 2t + (27 -t)^2/s².

So, our function to minimize is f(s, t)=s² -2t + (27 -t)^2/s².

But we have the constraint from the volume: t*(27 -t)/s =23 → t(27 -t)=23s.

Let me express t in terms of s or vice versa.

From t(27 -t)=23s →27t -t²=23s → s=(27t -t²)/23.

So, s is expressed in terms of t. Now, substitute this into f(s, t):

f(t)=s² -2t + (27 -t)^2/s²

But s=(27t -t²)/23, so s²=(27t -t²)^2/(23)^2.

Similarly, (27 -t)^2 is just (27 -t)^2.

So, f(t)= [ (27t - t²)^2 ] / (23)^2 - 2t + [ (27 - t)^2 ] / [ (27t -t²)^2 / (23)^2 ]

Simplify the third term:

[ (27 -t)^2 ] * (23)^2 / (27t -t²)^2.

So, putting it all together:

f(t)= [ (27t -t²)^2 ] / 529 -2t + [ (27 -t)^2 * 529 ] / (27t -t²)^2.

This seems complicated, but maybe I can set u=27t -t² to simplify.

Let u=27t -t² → du/dt=27 - 2t.

Then, f(t)= u²/529 -2t + (27 -t)^2 *529 /u².

But this substitution doesn't seem to help much. Maybe I can consider f(t) as a function and take its derivative with respect to t to find the minimum.

But this might get very messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that t is a variable and find f(t) as a function, then find its minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the minimal x² + y² + z² is achieved when the variables are in a certain proportion.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that x = y, as I did earlier, leading to a feasible solution. Then, perhaps that is the minimal value.

Earlier, when I assumed x=y, I found that x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529≈32.7.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution.

Wait, maybe I can use the AM-QM inequality. The QM is sqrt( (x² + y² + z²)/3 ). The AM is (x + y + z)/3.

But I'm not sure how it would help.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the minimal x² + y² + z² given the constraints.

Wait, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers, but treating x, y, z as variables, but it's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a different way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can write x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

We know that x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) = u² -54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize u².

So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal u², given that 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

Hmm, perhaps I can use the inequality between u and v.

I know that for positive real numbers, u³ ≥ 27w, by AM ≥ GM.

Since u/3 ≥ (w)^(1/3). So, u ≥3*(23)^(1/3)≈3*2.843≈8.529.

But we also have another constraint: v=27.

Hmm, perhaps using the inequality that relates u, v, w.

I recall that for three variables, the following inequality holds:  u³ ≥ 27w, but also, there's another inequality involving u, v, and w.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inequality that (x + y + z)^3 ≥ 27xyz, which is the AM ≥ GM inequality. Which gives u³ ≥27*23=621. So, u≥ cube root of 621≈8.529.

But earlier, from Cauchy-Schwarz, I had u≥9.

So, which one is the correct lower bound?

Wait, the Cauchy-Schwarz gave u² -54 ≥ u²/3 → 2u²/3 ≥54 → u² ≥81 →u≥9.

So, that suggests that u cannot be less than 9, which is a stricter condition than u≥8.529.

So, perhaps the minimal u is 9, but as I saw earlier, when I tried u=9, the equation t³ -9t² +27t -23=0 didn't seem to have positive real roots.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me try solving t³ -9t² +27t -23=0 numerically.

Using the rational root theorem didn't find any roots, so perhaps it has one real root and two complex roots.

Let me compute f(t)=t³ -9t² +27t -23.

Compute f(2)=8 -36 +54 -23=3.

f(3)=27 -81 +81 -23=4.

f(1)=1 -9 +27 -23= -4.

f(0)=-23.

f(4)=64 -144 +108 -23=5.

f(5)=125 -225 +135 -23=12.

Hmm, seems like f(t) crosses zero between t=1 and t=2, since f(1)=-4 and f(2)=3.

So, there's a real root between 1 and 2. Let me approximate it.

Using Newton-Raphson:

f(t)=t³ -9t² +27t -23.

f'(t)=3t² -18t +27.

Take t0=2: f(2)=3, f'(2)=12 -36 +27=3.

Next approximation: t1=2 - f(t0)/f'(t0)=2 -3/3=1.

f(1)= -4, f'(1)=3 -18 +27=12.

t2=1 - (-4)/12=1 +1/3≈1.333.

f(1.333)= (2.37) - (16.99) + (36.99) -23≈(2.37 -16.99)= -14.62 +36.99=22.37 -23≈-0.63.

f'(1.333)=3*(1.777) -18*(1.333) +27≈5.333 -24 +27≈8.333.

t3=1.333 - (-0.63)/8.333≈1.333 +0.075≈1.408.

f(1.408)= (1.408)^3 -9*(1.408)^2 +27*(1.408) -23.

Compute 1.408³≈2.81 (exact: 1.408 *1.408=1.982; 1.982 *1.408≈2.801).

9*(1.408)^2=9*1.982≈17.838.

27*1.408≈37.999.

So, f(t)=2.801 -17.838 +37.999 -23≈(2.801 -17.838)= -15.037 +37.999≈22.962 -23≈-0.038.

f'(1.408)=3*(1.408)^2 -18*(1.408) +27≈3*(1.982)=5.947 -25.344 +27≈(5.947 -25.344)= -19.397 +27≈7.603.

Next approximation: t4=1.408 - (-0.038)/7.603≈1.408 +0.005≈1.413.

Compute f(1.413):

1.413³≈2.82.

9*(1.413)^2≈9*(1.996)=17.964.

27*1.413≈38.151.

So, f=2.82 -17.964 +38.151 -23≈(2.82 -17.964)= -15.144 +38.151≈23.007 -23≈0.007.

Close enough. So, the real root is approximately 1.413.

So, the cubic equation t³ -9t² +27t -23=0 has one real root at t≈1.413 and two complex roots.

Therefore, when u=9, x + y + z=9, and the variables x, y, z include one real number≈1.413 and two complex numbers, which are not acceptable because we need all x, y, z to be positive real numbers.

Therefore, u cannot be 9, as it would require complex dimensions, which is impossible.

Therefore, the minimal u must be greater than 9.

So, going back, when I assumed x=y, the sum u≈9.309, which is feasible, as all variables are positive real numbers.

So, perhaps the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal, as we found earlier.

Hence, the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Now, let me compute r², which is (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But wait, let me compute this fraction.

Wait, 27171 divided by 2116: let me see.

Wait, 2116 *13=27508, which is higher than 27171. 2116*12=25392. 27171-25392=1779.

So, 27171=2116*12 +1779.

Similarly, 4032 divided by 2116: 2116*1=2116, 4032-2116=1916.

So, 4032=2116*1 +1916.

Hmm, but I don't see a common factor. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.

But the numerator is 27171 -4032√6, which can't be factored with denominator 2116.

Wait, 2116=46².

Wait, let me check if 27171 and 4032 have any common factors with 46.

46=2*23.

Check if 27171 is divisible by 23: 23*1181=27163, which is close to 27171, but 27171-27163=8, so no.

4032 divided by 23: 23*175=4025, 4032-4025=7, so remainder 7. So, not divisible.

So, the fraction is already in simplest terms.

Thus, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But wait, the problem states that r² can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers.

But the numerator here is 27171 -4032√6, which includes a radical, which is irrational. So, that can't be expressed as a fraction of integers.

Wait, that suggests that I made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, maybe my earlier assumption that two variables are equal is not the correct path. Because if I end up with an irrational expression for r², which can't be expressed as p/q, then perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that the minimal sphere enclosing the box will have a diameter equal to the space diagonal, so the minimal r is half of that. So, r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4. But to minimize r², I need to minimize x² + y² + z².

But in the case where x, y, z are all equal, that's a cube, but the volume is 27, which is higher than 23, so that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when the box is a cube scaled down, but with some sides longer.

Wait, but since I can't have a cube, maybe the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal, but perhaps I need to find a way to express this without radicals.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the minimal x² + y² + z² is achieved when the box is a cube scaled by some factor, but considering the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can use the method of substitution with variables.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote x = a, y = a, z = b, as before.

We have 2(a² + 2ab) =54 → a² + 2ab=27.

And a² b=23.

From a² +2ab=27, solve for b: b=(27 -a²)/(2a).

Substitute into a² b=23:

a²*(27 -a²)/(2a)=23 → a*(27 -a²)/2=23 → a(27 -a²)=46.

So, 27a -a³=46 → a³ -27a +46=0.

Earlier, we saw that a=2 is a solution, so factor it as (a -2)(a² +2a -23)=0.

So, a=2, or a=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 ±4√6)/2= -1 ±2√6.

As before, a must be positive, so a=2 or a= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, for a=2, we have z=(27 -4)/(4)=23/4=5.75.

Thus, x=y=2, z=5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z²=4 +4 + (23/4)^2=8 + (529/16)= (128 +529)/16=657/16.

So, r²= (657/16)/4=657/64.

Wait, 657 and 64: 657 factors into 3*219=3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. No common factors, so 657/64 is in simplest terms.

So, p=657, q=64. p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered a= -1 +2√6, I got a more minimal x² + y² + z²≈32.7, which is smaller than 657/16≈41.06. But when I tried that, I ended up with an expression involving √6, which couldn't be expressed as a fraction p/q.

But wait, perhaps in that case, the minimal occurs at x=y= -1 +2√6, z=(25 +4√6)/23, leading to x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529, which is approximately 32.7.

But the problem states that r² can be written as p/q, which suggests that r² is a rational number. Therefore, the minimal must occur at a=2, leading to r²=657/64, which is rational.

Hmm, perhaps the assumption that x=y= -1 +2√6 is not valid, because it leads to an irrational r², which contradicts the problem statement.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal occurs at a=2, leading to r²=657/64.

But wait, why is that? Because when I assumed x=y, I found two solutions, one leading to a rational r² and another leading to an irrational one.

But the problem states that the sphere must contain each of the boxes in set B. Therefore, the radius must be the maximum minimal radius over all possible boxes in B. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sphere must contain each box, so the radius must be the maximum of the minimal enclosing spheres for each box.

Wait, no, wait, the sphere must be the smallest one that can contain every box in B. So, it's the minimal radius such that all boxes in B can fit inside the sphere.

Wait, but each box in B has surface area 54 and volume 23, but different dimensions. The sphere must be large enough to contain the largest possible box in B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I misread the problem. It says: "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B."

So, the sphere must contain every box in B. So, it's the minimal sphere that contains all possible boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.

Hmm, that changes things. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain any possible box with surface area 54 and volume 23.

Therefore, the radius r must be at least as large as the maximum space diagonal of any box in B.

Therefore, r is the maximum of (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2 over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.

Therefore, I need to find the maximum value of x² + y² + z² given 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

Wait, earlier I was minimizing x² + y² + z², but now I need to find its maximum.

Ah, that's the key. Since the sphere must contain every box, the radius must be determined by the box with the largest space diagonal.

So, my goal is to find the maximum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints.

That's a different problem. So, I need to maximize x² + y² + z², which is equivalent to maximizing the space diagonal.

Hmm, how do I approach this?

So, given 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23, find the maximum of x² + y² + z².

This is now an optimization problem where I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² with the given constraints.

Perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers again.

Set up the function f(x, y, z)=x² + y² + z².

Constraints: g(x, y, z)=2(xy + yz + xz)-54=0 and h(x, y, z)=xyz -23=0.

Set up the Lagrangian: L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) -54) - μ(xyz -23).

Take partial derivatives:

dL/dx = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ yz =0

Similarly,

dL/dy = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ xz=0

dL/dz = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ xy=0

And constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz)=54

xyz=23

So, same as before, but now looking for maximum.

Assuming that the maximum occurs when variables are unequal.

Alternatively, perhaps when one variable is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible.

Let me consider that as one dimension increases, others decrease, given the fixed volume and surface area.

So, perhaps the maximum x² + y² + z² occurs when one variable is maximum, and the others are minimum.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can fix two variables and express the third.

Let me suppose that x approaches 0, but then the volume xyz=23 would require y or z to approach infinity, but surface area is fixed at 54, which would not allow that. So, variables cannot approach zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the maximum when one variable is as large as possible.

Wait, but given the constraints, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different.

Wait, let me try to assume x=y, as before.

So, x=y=a, z=b.

Then, 2(a² + 2ab)=54 → a² +2ab=27.

And a² b=23.

From a² +2ab=27, express b=(27 -a²)/(2a).

Substitute into a² b=23:

a²*(27 -a²)/(2a)=23 → a(27 -a²)=46 →27a -a³=46 →a³ -27a +46=0.

We already solved this equation earlier, and found a=2 and a= -1 ±2√6.

Since a must be positive, a=2 or a= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, for a=2, z= (27 -4)/(4)=23/4=5.75.

x² + y² + z²=4 +4 + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625=657/16.

For a= -1 +2√6≈3.898, z=(27 - (25 -4√6))/(2*(-1 +2√6)).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when a= -1 +2√6, then a²= (25 -4√6).

So, b=(27 - (25 -4√6))/(2a)= (2 +4√6)/(2a)= (1 +2√6)/a.

But a= -1 +2√6, so b=(1 +2√6)/(-1 +2√6).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 -2√6):

b=(1 +2√6)(-1 -2√6)/[(-1 +2√6)(-1 -2√6)].

Denominator: (-1)^2 - (2√6)^2=1 -24= -23.

Numerator: (1)(-1) + (1)(-2√6) + (2√6)(-1) + (2√6)(-2√6)= -1 -2√6 -2√6 -24= (-1 -24) + (-4√6)= -25 -4√6.

So, b= (-25 -4√6)/(-23)= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, x=y= a= -1 +2√6≈3.898, z= (25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

Then, x² + y² + z²= 2a² + z²=2*(25 -4√6) + (25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2.

Compute 2a²=50 -8√6.

z²=(625 + 200√6 +96)/529=(721 +200√6)/529.

So, total x² + y² + z²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert to a common denominator:

50=50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So, adding together:

26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6=26450 +721=27171; -4232√6 +200√6= -4032√6.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529≈32.7.

Wait, but earlier, when a=2, x² + y² + z²≈41.06, which is larger than 32.7.

Wait, but I thought I was maximizing x² + y² + z². So, why is a=2 giving a larger value?

Ah, because when a=2, the box is more "spread out", with larger z, leading to a larger space diagonal. Whereas when a= -1 +2√6, the box is more cube-like, leading to a smaller space diagonal.

Therefore, the maximum occurs when a=2, leading to x² + y² + z²=657/16≈41.06.

Therefore, r²=(657/16)/4=657/64≈10.265625.

So, p=657, q=64. Are they coprime?

657 ÷ 3=219, 64 ÷3= not integer. 657 ÷2=328.5, not integer. So, yes, 657 and 64 share no common factors besides 1.

Therefore, p + q=657 +64=721.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius \( r \) is half the space diagonal of the box, so \( r^2 \) is one-fourth of the sum of the squares of the box's dimensions \( x, y, z \). Thus, we aim to maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) under the given constraints.

### Key Steps:

1. **Constraints**:
   - Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \) ⟹ \( xy + yz + xz = 27 \).
   - Volume: \( xyz = 23 \).

2. **Objective**:
   - Maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \).

3. **Assumption**:
   - Assume \( x = y = a \) and \( z = b \) to simplify the problem.

4. **Substitution**:
   - From the surface area constraint: \( a^2 + 2ab = 27 \) ⟹ \( b = \frac{27 - a^2}{2a} \).
   - From the volume constraint: \( a^2 b = 23 \) ⟹ \( a^2 \cdot \frac{27 - a^2}{2a} = 23 \) ⟹ \( a(27 - a^2) = 46 \) ⟹ \( a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0 \).

5. **Solving the Cubic Equation**:
   - The cubic equation \( a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0 \) has solutions \( a = 2 \) and \( a = -1 \pm 2\sqrt{6} \). Only positive solutions are considered, so \( a = 2 \) and \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \approx 3.898 \).

6. **Calculating \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \)**:
   - For \( a = 2 \), \( b = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \):
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2(2)^2 + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = \frac{657}{16}.
     \]
   - For \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \), \( b = \frac{25 + 4\sqrt{6}}{23} \approx 1.513 \):
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2a^2 + b^2 \approx 32.7.
     \]
   - The maximum value of \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) is \( \frac{657}{16} \).

7. **Calculating \( r^2 \)**:
   - \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} = \frac{657}{64} \).

8. **Simplifying**:
   - \( r^2 = \frac{657}{64} \), where 657 and 64 are coprime.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( p + q \) is \( 657 + 64 = 721 \).

\boxed{721}
