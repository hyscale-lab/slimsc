Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and I need to place some of them in a 5x5 grid. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Additionally, any extra chip I try to place would break one of these rules. Hmm, okay.

Let me start by understanding the problem. Each row must have chips of the same color, and each column must also have chips of the same color. So, for example, if I decide that the first row is all white, then every chip in that row must be white. Similarly, if the first column is all black, then every chip in that column must be black. 

Wait a minute, but if I have a grid where each row and each column is monochromatic, how do the colors interact where the rows and columns intersect? For example, if row 1 is white and column 1 is black, then the cell at (1,1) must be both white and black, which is impossible. So, that can't happen. Therefore, the color assignments for rows and columns must be consistent with each other.

This suggests that the entire grid's color configuration is determined by the colors of its rows and columns. But since each row and column must be homogeneous, the color of the entire grid is determined by the color assignments of the rows and columns, but with the constraint that whenever a row is colored, all its cells must be of that color, and similarly for columns. 

Wait, but if I choose colors for the rows and columns independently, that might lead to conflicts. For example, if row i is white and column j is black, then the cell at (i,j) can't be both. So, perhaps the color assignments must be such that for any cell (i,j), the color of row i and the color of column j must agree. 

That is, if I let R_i be the color of row i (either white or black) and C_j be the color of column j, then for every cell (i,j), R_i must equal C_j. Otherwise, there's a conflict. So, that would imply that all R_i's and C_j's must be the same. Wait, no, because maybe all R_i's are white, and all C_j's are white, then no problem. Or all R_i's are black and C_j's are black. But if some R_i's are white and some C_j's are black, then at their intersection, there's a conflict.

Wait, no. Because if a row is white, then every cell in that row must be white, regardless of the column's color. Similarly, if a column is black, every cell in that column must be black, regardless of the row's color. So, if a cell is in a white row and a black column, you have a conflict. Therefore, the only way for the grid to be consistent is that all the rows and all the columns are of the same color. Because if even one row is white and one column is black, their intersection would be impossible.

Wait, no. Hmm, maybe not necessarily all rows and all columns, but perhaps all rows and all columns have to be monochromatic, but they can independently choose their color, but with the constraint that for any cell, the row and column colors must match. So, the grid has to be such that all the row colors and column colors are the same. Because otherwise, you'd have a conflict. 

Wait, let me think of a small example. Suppose I have a 2x2 grid. Let's say row 1 is white, row 2 is black, column 1 is white, column 2 is black. Then, cell (1,1) is white (okay), cell (1,2) is black (but row 1 is white, so that cell should be white, but column 2 is black, conflict). So that's impossible. Therefore, in order for there to be no conflicts, whenever a row is white, all columns must be white, and vice versa.

Alternatively, if all rows are white, then all columns must be white as well. Similarly, if all rows are black, all columns must be black. Or, perhaps, there's another way. Wait, maybe I can have some rows white and others black, but all columns must be the same as the rows. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Suppose I have some rows white and others black. Then, for each column, if I have a white row and a black row, the column must be white in the white row and black in the black row, but that's impossible because the column can only be one color. Thus, each column must be the same color as every row. Therefore, if any
