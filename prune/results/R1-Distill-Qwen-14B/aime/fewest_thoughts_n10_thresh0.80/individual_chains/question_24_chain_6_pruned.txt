Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in this list.

Hmm, let me break this down. I'll take each property one by one and think about what they imply.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers are in the list, when you add them all up, you get 30. That's straightforward.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, so 9 appears more times than any other number. So in the list, 9 must occur more often than any other number.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. So if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer, which means either the single middle number or the average of two middle numbers must be an integer, and importantly, that integer isn't present in the list.

Alright, so I need to find such a list and then compute the sum of the squares of all the items. Let's figure out the structure of this list.

Let me consider the mode first. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice, but more than any other number. So, how many times does 9 appear? Let's think: if 9 appears only twice, then no other number can appear more than once. But if 9 appears three times, then others can appear at most twice. Wait, but the problem says "unique mode," so 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. So if another number appears the same number of times as 9, that would make it multimodal, which contradicts the unique mode.

So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So for example, if 9 appears three times, others can appear at most twice. If 9 appears twice, others can appear at most once. But wait, let's think about the minimal case. Let's see.

Also, the median not being in the list suggests that the median is either between two numbers in the list or, if the list has an odd number of elements, the middle number is not in the list. That's a bit tricky.

Let me consider the possible lengths of the list. The sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers. The minimum length of the list depends on the numbers. For example, if all numbers are 1, the list would have 30 elements. If they are all 15, it would have 2 elements. But since 9 is the mode, it must appear more times than others, so the list can't be too short.

Wait, let's think about the minimal number of elements. Since 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. So the minimal length is 2. But let's check if that's possible.

If the list has two elements, both 9, then the sum is 18, which is less than 30. So that's not possible. So maybe three elements. If the list has three elements, all 9s: 9,9,9. Sum is 27. Remaining sum is 3, but we need three numbers, but wait, that's already three numbers. So that's not possible because 27 is less than 30. So maybe two 9s and another number. Let's try.

Two 9s: sum is 18. Remaining sum is 12, which needs to be split into one
