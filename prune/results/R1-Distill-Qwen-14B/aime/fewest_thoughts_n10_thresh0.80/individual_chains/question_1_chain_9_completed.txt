Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y and z in terms of x, and then plug back into one of the equations.

But let me see: I have x = 2^(-7/24). Let me compute 2^(-7/24) as (2^(1/24))^(-7) or something, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.

Let me go back to equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

2^(-7/24) = 2^(1/2) y z

Divide both sides by 2^(1/2):

y z = 2^(-7/24 - 1/2)

Compute exponent: -7/24 - 1/2 = -7/24 - 12/24 = -19/24

So y z = 2^(-19/24)

Similarly, from equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-7/24) * z

Combine exponents: 1/3 is 8/24, so 8/24 -7/24 = 1/24. So:

y = 2^(1/24) z

So y is expressed in terms of z. Now, from equation (1), we have y z = 2^(-19/24). Let me substitute y = 2^(1/24) z into y z:

(2^(1/24) z) * z = 2^(-19/24)

Which is 2^(1/24) z^2 = 2^(-19/24)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/24):

z^2 = 2^(-19/24 - 1/24) = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square roots:

z = 2^(-5/12)

Since z is positive.

Now that I have z, I can find y from y = 2^(1/24) z.

z is 2^(-5/12), so:

y = 2^(1/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/24 - 5/12)

Convert 5/12 to 10/24:

1/24 -10/24 = -9/24 = -3/8

So y = 2^(-3/8)

Now, we have x, y, z.

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me double-check these exponents to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

From equation (3), let's verify:

z / (x y) should be 2^(1/4)

Compute z/(x y) = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)]

First, compute denominator exponents:

-7/24 + (-3/8) = -7/24 -9/24 = -16/24 = -2/3

So denominator is 2^(-2/3)

Then z/(x y) = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(-2/3)] = 2^(-5/12 + 2/3) = 2^(-5/12 +8/12)=2^(3/12)=2^(1/4)

Which is correct. So that checks out.

Similarly, from equation (2):

y/(x z) should be 2^(1/3)

Compute y/(x z)= [2^(-3/8)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12)]

Denominator exponents: -7/24 + (-5/12)= -7/24 -10/24= -17/24

So y/(x z)=2^(-3/8 +17/24). Let's convert exponents to 24 denominator:

-3/8 = -9/24, so:

-9/24 +17/24=8/24=1/3

So it's 2^(1/3). Correct.

Equation (1): x/(y z) should be 2^(1/2)

x/(y z)= [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)] 

Denominator exponents: -3/8 + (-5/12) = -9/24 -10/24= -19/24

So x/(y z)=2^(-7/24 +19/24)=2^(12/24)=2^(1/2). Correct.

Okay, so the values are correct.

Now, I need to compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let's compute the exponent first.

Compute 4 log x +3 log y +2 log z, since log(a^b)=b log a.

But since x, y, z are all powers of 2, it's easier to compute exponents:

x =2^(-7/24) → log₂x= -7/24
y=2^(-3/8) → log₂y= -3/8
z=2^(-5/12) → log₂z= -5/12

So, compute:

4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)

Let's compute each term:

4*(-7/24)= (-28)/24 = -7/6

3*(-3/8)= (-9)/8

2*(-5/12)= (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

Now, sum them up:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, get a common denominator. Let's see 6, 8. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each term:

-7/6 = (-28)/24

-9/8 = (-27)/24

-5/6 = (-20)/24

So, total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify:

-75/24 can be reduced. Divide numerator and denominator by 3.

-25/8.

So, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)= -25/8.

But the problem asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | =25/8.

Thus, m=25 and n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.

So m +n=25+8=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

we rewrite these equations in exponential form:

1. \(2^{1/2} = \frac{x}{yz}\)
2. \(2^{1/3} = \frac{y}{xz}\)
3. \(2^{1/4} = \frac{z}{xy}\)

Expressing each variable in terms of the others, we get:

1. \(x = 2^{1/2} \cdot yz\)
2. \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\)
3. \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy\)

By substituting these expressions into each other, we find:

1. From equation (3), substituting \(y\) from equation (2): \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot x \cdot (2^{1/3} \cdot xz)\)
2. Simplifying, we find \(z = 2^{7/12} \cdot x^2 \cdot z\), leading to \(x^2 = 2^{-7/12}\) and \(x = 2^{-7/24}\).

Using \(x = 2^{-7/24}\), we substitute back to find \(y\) and \(z\):

1. From equation (1): \(yz = 2^{-19/24}\)
2. From equation (2): \(y = 2^{1/24} \cdot z\)
3. Substituting \(y = 2^{1/24} \cdot z\) into \(yz = 2^{-19/24}\), we solve for \(z\) and find \(z = 2^{-5/12}\).
4. Substituting \(z\) back, we find \(y = 2^{-3/8}\).

Now, we compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

1. Calculate the exponents:
   - \(4 \log_2 x = 4 \cdot (-7/24) = -7/6\)
   - \(3 \log_2 y = 3 \cdot (-3/8) = -9/8\)
   - \(2 \log_2 z = 2 \cdot (-5/12) = -5/6\)

2. Summing these: \(-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6\)
3. Converting to a common denominator (24):
   - \(-28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8\)

Taking the absolute value, we get \(| -25/8 | = 25/8\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
