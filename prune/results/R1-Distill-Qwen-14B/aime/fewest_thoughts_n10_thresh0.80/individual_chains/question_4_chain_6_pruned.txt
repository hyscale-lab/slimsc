Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the game mechanics. So, each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The goal is to take the last token, so the player who takes it wins. That means if you're forced to make a move when there's only one token left and it's your turn, you can take it and win. If there are four tokens, you can take all four and win. But if you have to make a move when there are, say, two tokens left, you can only take one, leaving one for the opponent who then takes it and wins.

I think this is a classic combinatorial game problem, probably involving the concept of "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite: no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, for this problem, we need to determine for each n whether it's a winning position for the first player (Alice) or the second player (Bob). If n is a winning position for Alice, then Bob can't guarantee a win. But if n is a losing position for Alice, then Bob can ensure his victory.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). We can start from small n and work our way up, looking for a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Alice can win, meaning this is a W position.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes that 1 and wins. Or Alice can take 4, but she can't because there are only 2 tokens. So Alice's only option is to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which is a W position for Bob. Wait, no. Wait, in this case, Alice has to make a move, and any move she makes allows Bob to win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is an L for Alice and W for Bob.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of whether the current player can force a win. So for n=1: current player takes 1 and wins, so W.

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So current player can't force a win, so n=2 is L.

n=3: current player can take 1, leaving 2 for the opponent, which is L. So opponent is in a losing position, meaning current player can force a win. So n=3 is W.

n=4: current player can take 4 and win, so W.

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving 1 (W for opponent). So whatever current player does, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.

n=6: current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L for opponent). So current player can force a win. So n=6 is W.

n=7: current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W), or take 4, leaving 3 (W). So opponent can win regardless. So n=7 is L.

n=8: current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L) for opponent. So current player can win. So n=8 is W.

n=9: current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W), or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if the player takes 4, opponent is left with 5, which is a losing position. So current player can force a win. So n=9 is W.

Wait, but n=5 was L. So if current player takes 4, opponent gets n=5 (L), so opponent can't win. So n=9 is W.

n=10: current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). So opponent can win either way. So n=10 is L.

Hmm, let me list these out so far:

n | winner (if starting player can force win)
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10| L

Wait, so the pattern seems to have a cycle. Let's see:

Looking at the sequence: W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L...

So the positions where it's L are n=2,5,7,10,...

Wait, let's see the differences between L positions: 2,5,7,10.

So from 2 to 5 is 3, 5 to 7 is 2, 7 to 10 is 3. Hmm, maybe it's a cycle of 3, 2, 3, 2.

Wait, let's check more terms to see if the pattern holds.

n=11: current player can take 1, leaving 10 (L). So opponent is left with L, so current player can win. So n=11 is W.

n=12: current player can take 1, leaving 11 (W), or take 4, leaving 8 (W). So opponent can win. So n=12 is L.

n=13: current player takes 1, leaving 12 (L). So n=13 is W.

n=14: current player can take 1, leaving 13 (W), or take 4, leaving 10 (L). So if they take 4, opponent is at 10 (L), which is losing. So current player can win by taking 4. So n=14 is W.

n=15: current player can take 1, leaving 14 (W), or take 4, leaving 11 (W). So opponent can win either way. So n=15 is L.

n=16: current player takes 1, leaving 15 (L). So n=16 is W.

n=17: current player takes 1, leaving 16 (W), or takes 4, leaving 13 (W). So opponent can win. So n=17 is L.

Wait, no. Wait, n=17: if current player takes 4, leaving 13, which is W. So opponent can win. If current player takes 1, leaving 16, which is W. So opponent can win either way. So n=17 is L.

n=18: current player takes 1, leaving 17 (L). So n=18 is W.

n=19: current player can take 1, leaving 18 (W), or take 4, leaving 15 (L). So if current player takes 4, opponent is at 15 (L), so current player can force a win. So n=19 is W.

n=20: current player can take 1, leaving 19 (W), or take 4, leaving 16 (W). So opponent can win either way. So n=20 is L.

Okay, so let's list these:

n | winner
11| W
12| L
13| W
14| W
15| L
16| W
17| L
18| W
19| W
20| L

So the L positions up to n=20 are 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20.

Hmm, looking for a pattern. Let me see the differences between consecutive L positions:

2,5: +3
5,7: +2
7,10: +3
10,12: +2
12,15: +3
15,17: +2
17,20: +3

So alternately adding 3 and 2. So the L positions follow 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25, etc. So the pattern is every 5 numbers? Let me see:

Wait, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,
