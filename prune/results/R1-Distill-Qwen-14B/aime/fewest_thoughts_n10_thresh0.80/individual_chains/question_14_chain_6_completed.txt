Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me. It says:

Let \( N \) be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let \( Q \) and \( R \) be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when \( N \) is divided by 1000. Find \( Q + R \).

Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find \( N \), I have to divide it by 1000, get the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \), and add them together.

Alright, so focusing on the main part: finding \( N \). Let's denote \( N \) as a four-digit number, which means it can be represented as \( N = a b c d \), where each letter represents a digit, and \( a \) is not zero since it's a four-digit number.

The key property here is that changing any one of the digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in \( N \), if I replace it with 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

So, let's think about what this implies.

First, let's consider each digit position and what replacing it with 1 does to the number.

Let me denote the four-digit number as \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).

If we change the thousands digit \( a \) to 1, the number becomes \( 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \), which must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, if we change the hundreds digit \( b \) to 1, the number becomes \( 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \), which must be divisible by 7.

Same goes for the tens digit \( c \): changing it to 1 gives \( 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \), which is divisible by 7.

And finally, changing the units digit \( d \) to 1 gives \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \), which must also be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four modified numbers must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let me denote the original number as \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \). Then, the modified numbers are:

1. \( N_1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \)
2. \( N_2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \)
3. \( N_3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \)
4. \( N_4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \)

Each \( N_i \) is divisible by 7. So, \( N_i \equiv 0 \mod 7 \) for \( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

I can write each of these congruences:

1. \( N_1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \) → \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
2. \( N_2 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \) → \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
3. \( N_3 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \) → \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
4. \( N_4 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \) → \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

So, four congruences.

But also, the original number \( N \) must be as large as possible. So, we're looking for the maximum \( N \) satisfying these conditions.

Hmm. Maybe I can express each of these congruences in terms of the original number \( N \), and then find relations between the digits.

Let me try that.

First, I can note that \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).

So, \( N_1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + (N - 1000a) \).

Similarly, \( N_2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + (N - 1000a - 100b) \) → Wait, perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, since \( N_1 \) is changing the thousands digit, \( N_1 = 1100b + 10c + d + 1000 - 1000a + 1000a \)? No, perhaps another approach.

Wait, maybe I can write each \( N_i \) as \( N - x + 1 \times 10^k \), where x is the original digit in position k, and k is the digit position. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the difference between N and each Ni.

Wait, let's think about this: each N_i is N with one digit replaced by 1. So, for each digit position, we can express N_i as N - (original digit) * 10^k + 1 * 10^k.

So, for example, changing the thousands digit:

N1 = N - a*1000 + 1*1000.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit:

N2 = N - b*100 + 1*100.

Changing the tens digit:

N3 = N - c*10 + 1*10.

Changing the units digit:

N4 = N - d + 1.

So, each N_i = N - digit * 10^k + 1 * 10^k.

Which can be written as N_i = N + (1 - digit) * 10^k.

So, N_i ≡ 0 mod 7.

But N is the original number, which is congruent to some value mod7, say r.

So, N ≡ r mod7.

Thus, N_i = N + (1 - digit) * 10^k ≡ 0 mod7.

Which implies that:

r + (1 - digit) * 10^k ≡ 0 mod7.

So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 leads to N_i ≡0 mod7, which gives:

(1 - digit) * 10^k ≡ -r mod7.

But since this is true for each digit, we can write four equations:

For each digit position k:

(1 - digit_k) * 10^k ≡ -r mod7.

Hmm, but since r is the same for all four, this suggests that:

The term (1 - digit_k) * 10^k must be congruent to the same value mod7, namely -r.

Wait, but each equation is for a different digit position, so each has a different 10^k term.

Wait, 10^k mod7 cycles every 6 because 10 ≡ 3 mod7, 10^2=100≡2 mod7, 10^3=1000≡6 mod7, 10^4=10000≡4 mod7, etc. Wait, let's compute 10^k mod7 for k=0,1,2,3.

10^0 mod7 = 1.

10^1 mod7 = 3.

10^2 mod7 = 2.

10^3 mod7 = 6.

Because 10 ≡3 mod7,

10^2 = 3^2=9≡2,

10^3=3^3=27≡6,

10^4=3^4=81≡4,

10^5=3^5=12≡5,

10^6=3^6=15≡1, and then it repeats every 6.

So, for four-digit number, digits are at positions 3,2,1,0 (since thousands is 10^3, hundreds 10^2, tens 10^1, units 10^0).

So, 10^k mod7 for k=3,2,1,0 is 6,2,3,1 respectively.

So, each N_i corresponds to a different 10^k mod7.

Given that, for each digit position k (k=3,2,1,0), we have:

(1 - digit_k) * (10^k mod7) ≡ -r mod7.

Since r is the same for all four, so:

(1 - a)*6 ≡ -r mod7,

(1 - b)*2 ≡ -r mod7,

(1 - c)*3 ≡ -r mod7,

(1 - d)*1 ≡ -r mod7.

So, each of these expressions must be congruent to the same value mod7, which is -r.

Let me denote this common value as t. So,

(1 - a)*6 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - b)*2 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - c)*3 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - d)*1 ≡ t mod7.

So, all four expressions equal to t mod7.

So, each of these gives a relation between the digit and t.

Now, since t is the same for all four, perhaps we can set up equations to solve for t, a, b, c, d.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, since r is the remainder when N is divided by7, and N ≡ r mod7, then N_i = N + (1 - digit_k)*10^k ≡ r + (1 - digit_k)*(10^k mod7) ≡0 mod7.

So, for each k, (1 - digit_k)*(10^k mod7) ≡ -r mod7.

Which brings us back to the same point.

I think perhaps I can express each digit in terms of t:

From each equation:

1 - a ≡ t * 6^{-1} mod7,

1 - b ≡ t * 2^{-1} mod7,

1 - c ≡ t * 3^{-1} mod7,

1 - d ≡ t * 1^{-1} mod7.

I need to find the modular inverses of 6,2,3,1 mod7.

Let me compute them:

6^{-1} mod7: since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so 6^{-1}=6 mod7.

2^{-1} mod7: 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so 2^{-1}=4 mod7.

3^{-1} mod7: 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so 3^{-1}=5 mod7.

1^{-1} mod7 is 1.

So, substituting:

1 - a ≡ t *6 mod7,

1 - b ≡ t *4 mod7,

1 - c ≡ t *5 mod7,

1 - d ≡ t *1 mod7.

So, we can write:

a ≡1 -6t mod7,

b ≡1 -4t mod7,

c ≡1 -5t mod7,

d ≡1 -t mod7.

Since each of a,b,c,d is a digit (0-9), their values must be consistent with these congruences.

But since a is the thousands digit, it can't be zero. So, a is between 1 and 9.

Similarly, b,c,d are between 0 and 9.

But t is something we can vary from 0 to 6, as mod7.

So, let's consider possible values of t (0 to6) and see what digits a,b,c,d we get.

But we need to find the maximum N, which is a four-digit number. So, to maximize N, we need a as large as possible, then b, c, d as large as possible.

So, perhaps we can try t from 0 to6 and see for each t, what would be the digits a,b,c,d, and find which combination gives the largest N.

But t must satisfy that all digits are between 0 and9. So, let's check for each t:

t =0:

a ≡1 -0=1 mod7 → a=1,8,15… but a is a digit, so a=1 or8.

But wait, a is the thousands digit, so it can be 1 or 8.

Similarly,

b ≡1 -0=1 mod7 → b=1 or8.

c≡1 -0=1 mod7 → c=1 or8.

d≡1 -0=1 mod7 → d=1 or8.

But in this case, if t=0, then when we change any digit to1, the number becomes N_i ≡0 mod7.

But wait, if t=0, then r = -t mod7=0.

So, N ≡0 mod7.

But the problem says that changing any digit to 1 makes the number divisible by7. So, if N is already divisible by7, then changing a digit to 1 might or might not preserve that.

Wait, but the original N is not necessarily divisible by7. Because when we change a digit to1, the new number is divisible by7. But N itself could be anything.

Wait, but from the earlier equations, N ≡ r mod7, and the N_i ≡0 mod7. So, each N_i = N + delta ≡0 mod7, so delta ≡-r mod7.

But regardless, the key is that t is the same for all four equations.

So, back to t=0:

Digits:

a=1 or8,

b=1 or8,

c=1 or8,

d=1 or8.

Wait, but if all digits are 1 or8, that might be a possible N. But I need to maximize N, so I would want a=8, b=8, c=8, d=8.

But let's see if that's possible.

Wait, but if all digits are 8, then changing any digit to1 would give a number where that digit is 1 instead of8. Let's test whether each such number is divisible by7.

But let's check:

If N=8888,

Then N1=1888,

N2=8188,

N3=8818,

N4=8881.

Are all these numbers divisible by7?

Let me check N1=1888 ÷7.

7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5, so remainder5. Not divisible.

So, t=0 is invalid because N1 is not divisible by7.

Wait, but according to our earlier equations, with t=0, N_i should be 0 mod7. So, perhaps my reasoning is flawed.

Wait, maybe let me think again.

We have N ≡ r mod7.

Each N_i = N + (1 -digit_k)*10^k.

So, N_i ≡ r + (1 -digit_k)*(10^k mod7) ≡0 mod7.

So, for each k, (1 -digit_k)*(10^k mod7) ≡ -r mod7.

Which is the same as t = -r mod7.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when t=0, r=0, so N ≡0 mod7.

Then, each N_i = N + (1 -digit_k)*10^k ≡0 + (1 -digit_k)*10^k mod7.

But for each N_i to be 0 mod7, each (1 -digit_k)*10^k ≡0 mod7.

Which would require that either digit_k=1, or 10^k ≡0 mod7, which is impossible because 10^k mod7 is 6,2,3,1 for k=3,2,1,0.

So, the only way (1 -digit_k)*10^k ≡0 mod7 is if digit_k=1, because 10^k is not 0 mod7.

But in the case where t=0, digits a,b,c,d can be 1 or8 (as 1 mod7). But if a=8, which is 1 mod7, because 8 ≡1 mod7.

Wait, digits are 0-9, but their congruence mod7 can be 0-6.

So, if digit_k ≡1 mod7, then digit_k can be 1 or8.

So, in N, each digit is either1 or8, because t=0.

But when you change a digit to1, the new digit is 1, so the change is 1 - digit_k = 0, so N_i = N +0= N, which must be ≡0 mod7.

But N is ≡0 mod7, so that's okay. But wait, changing a digit from1 to1 is no change, so of course it's still divisible by7. But in the problem statement, it says "when one of its digits is changed to1". So, if the digit was already1, changing it to1 again doesn't change the number, so it's still divisible by7.

But if the digit is 8, changing it to1 would give a number that is N + (1 -8)*10^k = N -7*10^k.

Since N ≡0 mod7, 7*10^k is also 0 mod7, so N_i ≡0 mod7.

So, in the case where t=0, N must have all digits either1 or8, and N must be ≡0 mod7.

So, in this case, the maximum N would be 8888.

But earlier, I checked N1=1888, which is 8888 with a=1, but 1888 is not divisible by7. Wait, but according to this, changing a digit to1 would result in a number that is N -7*10^k, which is 8888 -7*1000=8888-7000=1888, which should be 0 mod7.

But 1888 ÷7 is 269.714..., which isn't an integer. Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, let's compute 1888 ÷7.

7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. So, 1888 ≡5 mod7.

But according to the earlier equations, if N=8888 ≡0 mod7, and N1=1888= N -7000, which should be 0 mod7.

But 7000 is 0 mod7, so N -7000 ≡0 -0=0 mod7. But 1888 is not 0 mod7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps my earlier conclusion was wrong. Let me verify.

Wait, 8888 ÷7: 7*1269=8883, 8888-8883=5, so 8888 ≡5 mod7. So, N ≡5 mod7.

But earlier, when t=0, the equations suggested that N ≡0 mod7. So, perhaps my initial assumption that t=0 leads to N ≡0 mod7 is incorrect.

Wait, let me go back.

We have:

Each (1 - digit_k)*10^k ≡ -r mod7.

And r is the remainder of N when divided by7, so r = N mod7.

Thus, for t, we have t = -r mod7.

So, if t=0, then r=0.

But in the case where N=8888, N mod7 is 5, so r=5, so t=-5 mod7=2 mod7.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because I set t=-r, but for each equation, t is the same.

So, perhaps I should think of t as (1 - digit_k)*10^k ≡ -r mod7 for all k.

Thus, for N=8888, r=5, and t would be (1 -8)*10^k mod7.

Wait, let's compute for k=3:

(1 -8)*10^3 mod7.

1-8 = -7.

-7*6 mod7: -7 is 0 mod7, so this is 0.

Similarly, for k=2:

(1-8)*100 mod7.

-7 *2 mod7=0.

Same for k=1 and k=0: all digits are8, so (1-8)=-7≡0 mod7, multiplied by any 10^k mod7 is still 0.

So, all four equations reduce to 0 ≡ -r mod7.

Which implies that r=0.

But in reality, N=8888 mod7 is5, which is not zero. So, that's a contradiction.

So, perhaps t cannot be zero.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Let me try a different angle.

We have four equations:

(1 - a)*6 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - b)*2 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - c)*3 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - d)*1 ≡ t mod7.

Let me denote t as a variable that is common to all four equations.

So, each equation is:

(1 - a)*6 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - b)*2 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - c)*3 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - d) ≡ t mod7.

So, perhaps I can express each digit in terms of t.

Let me do that.

From the first equation:

(1 - a)*6 ≡ t mod7 → Multiply both sides by 6^{-1}=6.

1 - a ≡6t mod7 → a ≡1 -6t mod7.

Similarly, second equation:

(1 - b)*2 ≡ t mod7 → multiply by 4 (2^{-1}=4 mod7).

1 - b ≡4t mod7 → b ≡1 -4t mod7.

Third equation:

(1 - c)*3 ≡ t mod7 → multiply by5 (3^{-1}=5 mod7).

1 - c ≡5t mod7 → c ≡1 -5t mod7.

Fourth equation:

(1 - d) ≡ t mod7 → d ≡1 -t mod7.

So, now we have:

a ≡1 -6t mod7,

b ≡1 -4t mod7,

c ≡1 -5t mod7,

d ≡1 -t mod7.

Since a, b, c, d are digits (0-9), their values must satisfy these congruences.

We can consider t from 0 to6, and for each t, compute a, b, c, d mod7, then find possible digits.

Our goal is to find the maximum N, so we want the largest possible a, then b, c, d.

So, let's go through t=0 to t=6 and see which gives the largest N.

t=0:

a ≡1 -0=1 mod7 → a=1 or8.

Since we want the largest a, choose a=8.

b ≡1 -0=1 mod7 → b=1 or8. Choose b=8.

c ≡1 -0=1 mod7 → c=1 or8. Choose c=8.

d ≡1 -0=1 mod7 → d=1 or8. Choose d=8.

So, N=8888.

But earlier, we saw that N=8888 is ≡5 mod7, which conflicts with our equations. Wait, but in this case, t=0 implies that r= -t mod7=0, so N should be ≡0 mod7.

But 8888 mod7 is5, so this is a problem.

So, perhaps t=0 is not acceptable because it doesn't satisfy N_i ≡0 mod7.

Wait, but according to the equations, if t=0, then each N_i would be N + (1 - digit_k)*10^k ≡0 mod7.

But in N=8888, which is ≡5 mod7, changing a digit to1 would make N_i = N -7*10^k ≡5 -0=5 mod7, which is not 0. So, this suggests that t=0 is invalid.

Hence, t cannot be zero.

Proceeding to t=1.

t=1:

a ≡1 -6*1=1-6=-5≡2 mod7. So, a=2 or9.

Choose a=9 (since we want maximum N).

b ≡1 -4*1=1-4=-3≡4 mod7. b=4 or11→ but b is a digit, so 4.

c ≡1 -5*1=1-5=-4≡3 mod7. c=3 or10→3.

d ≡1 -1=0 mod7. d=0 or7.

Choose d=7 (since 7 is allowed as a digit, but 0 is smaller).

So, a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7. So, N=9437.

Wait, let's check if this N satisfies the condition.

Compute N mod7: 9437 ÷7.

7*1348=9436, so 9437 ≡1 mod7.

Now, check each N_i:

N1: change a to1 →1437.

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2 → 1437≡2 mod7. Not 0. So, t=1 is invalid.

Hmm, so t=1 gives N=9437, but N1 is not 0 mod7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, according to our equations, when t=1, r= -t mod7= -1 mod7=6. So, N ≡6 mod7.

But our N=9437 is ≡1 mod7, which doesn't match. So, perhaps my earlier approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute r as -t mod7, so for t=1, r=6.

But N=9437 ≡1 mod7, which is not 6. So, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I should compute N as per the digits and then compute r.

Wait, N=9437. Let me compute 9437 mod7.

Compute 9437 ÷7:

7*1348 =9436, so 9437=7*1348 +1 →9437≡1 mod7.

But according to our equations, r= -t mod7= -1=6 mod7. So, N should be ≡6 mod7, but it's 1. So, something's wrong.

Perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that t is the same across all four equations, but r is a fixed value, so t must be consistent across all digits.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find a t such that all digits a,b,c,d are consistent with their congruences, and N ≡ r mod7, where r= -t mod7.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should proceed step by step.

Let me assume t=1 and see.

From t=1, as above, a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7.

So, N=9437.

Compute N mod7:

Compute 9437 ÷7:

Well, 7*1340=9380.

9437-9380=57.

57 ÷7=8*7=56, remainder1.

So, 9437≡1 mod7.

But from earlier, r= -t= -1 mod7=6. So, N should be ≡6 mod7, but it's 1. So, this is inconsistent.

Hence, t=1 is invalid.

So, perhaps t=1 is not acceptable.

Proceeding to t=2.

t=2:

a ≡1 -6*2=1-12=-11≡-11+14=3 mod7. So, a=3 or10→3.

b ≡1 -4*2=1-8=-7≡0 mod7. b=0 or7.

c ≡1 -5*2=1-10=-9≡-9+14=5 mod7. c=5.

d ≡1 -2= -1≡6 mod7. d=6 or13→6.

So, a=3 or10→3.

To maximize N, we need a as large as possible. So, a=3 is the only option here.

b=0 or7. To maximize, choose b=7.

c=5.

d=6.

So, N=3 7 5 6 → 3756.

Check N mod7:

3756 ÷7.

7*536=3752, 3756-3752=4 →3756≡4 mod7.

r= -t= -2 mod7=5.

But N=3756≡4 mod7≠5. So, inconsistent.

Thus, t=2 invalid.

t=3:

a ≡1 -6*3=1-18=-17≡-17+21=4 mod7. So, a=4 or11→4.

b ≡1 -4*3=1-12=-11≡-11+14=3 mod7. b=3 or10→3.

c ≡1 -5*3=1-15=-14≡0 mod7. c=0 or7.

d ≡1 -3= -2≡5 mod7. d=5 or12→5.

To maximize N: a=4, b=3, c=7, d=5.

So, N=4375.

Compute N mod7:

4375 ÷7= 625, because 7*625=4375. So, 4375≡0 mod7.

r= -t= -3 mod7=4.

But N=4375≡0 mod7≠4. So, inconsistent.

Thus, t=3 invalid.

t=4:

a ≡1 -6*4=1-24=-23≡-23+28=5 mod7. So, a=5 or12→5.

b ≡1 -4*4=1-16=-15≡-15+21=6 mod7. b=6 or13→6.

c ≡1 -5*4=1-20=-19≡-19+21=2 mod7. c=2 or9.

d ≡1 -4= -3≡4 mod7. d=4 or11→4.

Maximize N: a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

So, N=5694.

Compute N mod7:

5694 ÷7.

7*813=5691, 5694-5691=3 →5694≡3 mod7.

r= -t= -4 mod7=3. So, r=3.

But N=5694≡3 mod7, which matches r=3. So, that's consistent.

Now, check if each N_i is divisible by7.

Compute N1: change a to1 → 1694.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. So, yes, divisible by7.

N2: change b to1 →5194.

5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Yes.

N3: change c to1 →5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Yes.

N4: change d to1 →5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Yes.

So, all N_i are divisible by7. So, t=4 gives a valid N=5694.

But is this the maximum possible?

Wait, let's see if we can get a larger N.

t=5:

a ≡1 -6*5=1-30=-29≡-29+35=6 mod7. So, a=6 or13→6.

b ≡1 -4*5=1-20=-19≡-19+21=2 mod7. b=2 or9.

c ≡1 -5*5=1-25=-24≡-24+28=4 mod7. c=4 or11→4.

d ≡1 -5= -4≡3 mod7. d=3 or10→3.

Maximize N: a=6, b=9, c=4, d=3.

N=6943.

Compute N mod7:

6943 ÷7.

7*991=6937, 6943-6937=6 →6943≡6 mod7.

r= -t= -5 mod7=2.

But N=6943≡6 mod7≠2. So, inconsistent.

Thus, t=5 invalid.

t=6:

a ≡1 -6*6=1-36=-35≡0 mod7. a=0 or7→0 invalid as thousands digit. So, a=7.

b ≡1 -4*6=1-24=-23≡-23+28=5 mod7. b=5 or12→5.

c ≡1 -5*6=1-30=-29≡-29+35=6 mod7. c=6 or13→6.

d ≡1 -6= -5≡2 mod7. d=2 or9.

Maximize N: a=7, b=5, c=6, d=9.

So, N=7569.

Compute N mod7:

7569 ÷7.

7*1081=7567, 7569-7567=2 →7569≡2 mod7.

r= -t= -6 mod7=1.

But N=7569≡2 mod7≠1. So, inconsistent.

Thus, t=6 invalid.

So, the only valid t we found so far is t=4, which gives N=5694.

Wait, but is this the only valid one? Let me check t=0 again.

Earlier, t=0 gave N=8888, which didn't satisfy the condition, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let me recompute N=8888 mod7.

Compute 8888 ÷7:

7*1269=8883, 8888-8883=5 →8888≡5 mod7.

So, r=5.

Then, t= -r mod7= -5=2 mod7.

Wait, but earlier, I thought t=0, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the equations are:

(1 - a)*6 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - b)*2 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - c)*3 ≡ t mod7,

(1 - d) ≡ t mod7.

And t = -r mod7.

So, for N=8888, r=5, so t= -5 mod7=2.

So, t=2.

Let me compute the left-hand sides for t=2:

(1 - a)*6 mod7: for a=8, 1-8=-7≡0 mod7 →0*6=0≡t=2? No, 0≡2 mod7? No.

So, t=2≠0. So, N=8888 with t=2 doesn't satisfy the first equation.

Hence, N=8888 is invalid.

So, the only valid t is t=4, giving N=5694.

But wait, 5694 is a four-digit number, but is it the largest possible?

Wait, perhaps there are other t values that give valid N with a larger value.

Wait, when t=4, we got N=5694.

But when t=2, we had N=3756, which is smaller.

t=1 gave 9437, but it didn't satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in t=1.

Wait, when t=1, a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7. So, N=9437.

Compute N mod7:9437 ÷7.

We can compute 9437 mod7.

Compute 9437 ÷7:

Well, 7*1348=9436, so 9437=7*1348 +1 →9437≡1 mod7.

But r= -t= -1 mod7=6.

So, N=9437≡1≠6 mod7. So, invalid.

Thus, t=1 is invalid.

Wait, but earlier when t=4, N=5694, which worked.

Is there a higher N possible?

Wait, let's think about t=3.

t=3:

a=4, b=3, c=7, d=5 →N=4375.

Check N=4375 mod7: 4375 ÷7=625 →4375≡0 mod7.

r= -t= -3 mod7=4.

But N=4375≡0≠4 mod7. So, invalid.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check for other t values where N could be larger than 5694.

Wait, when t=5, N=6943, but it didn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, let me check t=5 again.

t=5:

a=6, b=9, c=4, d=3 →N=6943.

Compute 6943 mod7.

Compute 6943 ÷7:

7*991=6937, 6943-6937=6 →6943≡6 mod7.

r= -t= -5 mod7=2.

But N=6943≡6≠2 mod7. So, invalid.

t=6:

N=7569.

7569 mod7=2.

r= -t= -6 mod7=1.

2≠1→invalid.

So, the only valid t is t=4, which gives N=5694.

Wait, but is there a larger N with t=4?

Wait, when t=4, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

Wait, but perhaps I can choose a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which gives N=5694.

Is there a way to get a larger N with t=4?

Wait, a=5 is the maximum possible for t=4, as a ≡5 mod7, so a=5 or12→5.

b=6 is maximum.

c=9 is maximum.

d=4 is maximum.

So, 5694 is the maximum for t=4.

But wait, is there another way to get a larger N? Let's think.

Wait, maybe t=4 can lead to a higher N if we can have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 as above, but perhaps higher digits in other positions.

Wait, but a=5 is fixed as the maximum for t=4.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there's a t that gives a higher a.

Wait, t=4 gives a=5, but maybe another t gives a=9.

Looking back, t=0 would give a=8, but it didn't work.

t=1 gives a=9, but N=9437 didn't work.

t=2 gives a=3, which is lower.

t=3 gives a=4.

t=4 gives a=5.

t=5 gives a=6.

t=6 gives a=7.

So, the highest a is 9, but only for t=1, which gave invalid N.

So, the next highest a is7 for t=6, but N=7569 didn't satisfy the condition.

So, the highest valid a seems to be5 for t=4.

Thus, N=5694 is the highest possible.

Wait, but wait a second. What if we can find a larger N with t=4 by adjusting digits differently?

Wait, t=4 gives a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

But perhaps if we adjust some digits to higher values while keeping the congruences.

Wait, but according to the congruences, for t=4:

a ≡5 mod7 →a=5 or12→5.

b ≡6 mod7→6 or13→6.

c≡2 mod7→2 or9→9.

d≡4 mod7→4 or11→4.

So, digits are fixed as a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

Thus, N=5694 is the only possible for t=4.

But let me think, is there a way to have a higher N with a different t?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming t must be the same across all four equations. Maybe I should consider that each digit change leads to N_i ≡0 mod7, but perhaps the way I set up t is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for each digit, changing it to1 must make N_i divisible by7.

So, for each digit position, the difference between N and N_i is (digit -1)*10^k.

So, N - N_i = (digit -1)*10^k.

But N_i ≡0 mod7, so N ≡(digit -1)*10^k mod7.

So, N ≡ (digit_k -1)*10^k mod7 for each k=3,2,1,0.

Which implies that each digit_k ≡1 + (N /10^k) mod7, but this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, for each digit position k, (digit_k -1)*10^k ≡N mod7.

But N is the same for all four, so each (digit_k -1)*10^k ≡ same value mod7.

So, let me denote s = N mod7.

Then, for each k, (digit_k -1)*10^k ≡s mod7.

So, for k=3:

(digit_3 -1)*6 ≡s mod7.

k=2:

(digit_2 -1)*2 ≡s mod7.

k=1:

(digit_1 -1)*3 ≡s mod7.

k=0:

(digit_0 -1)*1 ≡s mod7.

So, we have four equations:

1. (a -1)*6 ≡s mod7.

2. (b -1)*2 ≡s mod7.

3. (c -1)*3 ≡s mod7.

4. (d -1)*1 ≡s mod7.

Now, s is fixed for the number N.

So, all four expressions must be congruent to the same s mod7.

So, let's solve these equations.

From equation4: d ≡1 + s mod7.

From equation3: (c-1)*3 ≡s mod7 → c ≡1 + (s *3^{-1}) mod7.

Similarly, equation2: (b-1)*2 ≡s mod7 → b ≡1 + (s *2^{-1}) mod7.

Equation1: (a-1)*6 ≡s mod7 → a ≡1 + (s *6^{-1}) mod7.

As before, 3^{-1}=5, 2^{-1}=4, 6^{-1}=6.

So:

d ≡1 + s mod7.

c ≡1 +5s mod7.

b ≡1 +4s mod7.

a ≡1 +6s mod7.

Now, s can be 0 to6.

We can try each s from0 to6 and find the maximum N for each s, then pick the maximum N.

Let's proceed.

s=0:

d=1+0=1.

c=1+0=1.

b=1+0=1.

a=1+0=1.

So, N=1111. But we can have higher digits.

But since we want maximum N, let's see for each s:

s=0:

a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1. N=1111.

s=1:

d=1+1=2.

c=1+5*1=6.

b=1+4*1=5.

a=1+6*1=7.

So, a=7, b=5, c=6, d=2. N=7562.

s=2:

d=1+2=3.

c=1+5*2=11→4.

b=1+4*2=9.

a=1+6*2=13→6.

So, a=6, b=9, c=4, d=3. N=6943.

s=3:

d=1+3=4.

c=1+5*3=16→2.

b=1+4*3=13→6.

a=1+6*3=19→5.

So, a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4. N=5624.

s=4:

d=1+4=5.

c=1+5*4=21→0.

b=1+4*4=17→3.

a=1+6*4=25→4.

So, a=4, b=3, c=0, d=5. N=4305.

s=5:

d=1+5=6.

c=1+5*5=26→5.

b=1+4*5=21→0.

a=1+6*5=31→3.

So, a=3, b=0, c=5, d=6. N=3056.

s=6:

d=1+6=7.

c=1+5*6=31→3.

b=1+4*6=25→4.

a=1+6*6=37→2.

So, a=2, b=4, c=3, d=7. N=2437.

Now, among all these N values:

s=0:1111,

s=1:7562,

s=2:6943,

s=3:5624,

s=4:4305,

s=5:3056,

s=6:2437.

The maximum among these is 7562 when s=1.

Wait, but earlier when t=4, we had N=5694, which was valid, but here, s=1 gives N=7562, which might be higher.

Wait, but need to check if N=7562 satisfies the condition that changing any digit to1 results in a number divisible by7.

Let me check:

N=7562.

Check N1: change a to1 →1562.

1562 ÷7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1 →1562≡1 mod7≠0. So, invalid.

Thus, N=7562 is invalid.

Wait, so my earlier approach of fixing s and computing N gives N=7562, but it doesn't satisfy the condition. So, perhaps this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, going back, the equations are:

For each digit position k:

(digit_k -1)*10^k ≡s mod7, where s=N mod7.

So, for N=7562, s=7562 mod7.

Compute 7562 ÷7:

7*1080=7560, 7562-7560=2 →7562≡2 mod7.

Thus, s=2.

So, for each digit:

digit_3 -1=7-1=6 →6*6=36≡1≡s=2? No, 36 mod7=1≡s=2? No. So, 1≡2 mod7? No. So, invalid.

Thus, N=7562 is invalid.

So, the approach where s is fixed and digits are computed accordingly might not work because the values don't satisfy the conditions.

So, perhaps the only valid N is 5694.

Wait, but earlier when s=1, N=7562 didn't work, but when s=4, N=5694 worked.

So, perhaps the only valid N is 5694.

But wait, let's check s=2, N=6943.

Compute N=6943 mod7: 6943 ÷7=991*7=6937, 6943-6937=6 →6943≡6 mod7.

So, s=6.

Check each digit:

digit_3=6 → (6-1)*6=5*6=30≡2 mod7. s=6→2≡6? No.

Thus, invalid.

Similarly, N=5694 mod7=5694-7*813=5694-5691=3→s=3.

Check each digit:

digit_3=5 →(5-1)*6=4*6=24≡3 mod7→s=3. Correct.

digit_2=6 →(6-1)*2=5*2=10≡3 mod7→s=3. Correct.

digit_1=9→(9-1)*3=8*3=24≡3 mod7→s=3. Correct.

digit_0=4→(4-1)*1=3≡3 mod7→s=3. Correct.

So, all digits satisfy the condition, thus N=5694 is valid.

Now, is there a higher N that satisfies the condition?

Looking back, when s=4, we had N=5694. What's the next possible s that could give a higher N?

Wait, when s=4, N=5694. What's the maximum a possible? When s=4, a=5. Could we have a=6 and another s?

Wait, from earlier, when s=5, a=6, but N=6943 didn't work.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another N where a=9, but that would require s such that a=9 ≡1 +6s mod7.

So, 9 ≡1 +6s mod7 →8≡6s mod7 →6s≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by6^{-1}=6:

s≡6*1=6 mod7.

So, s=6.

Then, for s=6:

a=1+6*6=37≡2 mod7→a=2 or9.

Wait, a=9 is possible.

So, for s=6:

a=9,

b=1+4*6=25≡4 mod7→b=4 or11→4.

c=1+5*6=31≡3 mod7→c=3 or10→3.

d=1+6=7.

So, N=9437.

But earlier, N=9437 mod7=1, which should be s=1, but according to s=6, it should be s=6.

Conflict. So, invalid.

Thus, perhaps the only valid N is 5694.

Thus, the answer is N=5694.

So, Q is the quotient when N is divided by1000, which is 5, and R is the remainder, 694.

Thus, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let me confirm:

N=5694 ÷1000=5 with remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694. 5+694=699.

So, the answer is 699.


The greatest four-digit number \( N \) satisfying the given condition is 5694. When \( N \) is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 5 and the remainder \( R \) is 694. Therefore, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

\boxed{699}
