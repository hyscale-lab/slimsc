Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all rhombuses ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola (x²/20) - (y²/24) = 1. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, okay.

First, I should remember what a rhombus is. It's a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, wait, actually, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Right, that's a property of a rhombus. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, in this problem, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.

So, the rhombus ABCD is such that points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, if points A and C are on the hyperbola, then points B and D must also be on the hyper
