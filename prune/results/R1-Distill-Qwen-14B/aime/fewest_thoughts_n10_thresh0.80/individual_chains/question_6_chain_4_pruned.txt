Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. It's about finding the number of intersections between two graphs defined by some functions involving absolute values and trigonometric functions. Hmm, this might get a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. We're given two functions:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

We need to find how many times these two graphs intersect. That is, find all pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations.

Let me first understand what f and g are.

Given:
- f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |
- g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |

Alright, so both f and g are functions that take an absolute value, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. That structure seems to create a V-shaped graph with possible multiple segments.

Let me maybe sketch out what f(x) and g(x) look like.

Starting with f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. So, the vertex goes from (0,0) to (0, -1/2). Now, taking the absolute value of that: | |x| - 1/2 |.

So, when |x| - 1/2 is negative, taking absolute value reflects it upwards. So, the function f(x) will have a V-shape, but with a change in slope at points where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 and x = -1/2.

Let me find the expression for f(x) in different intervals.

Case 1: |x| ≥ 1/2. Then |x| - 1/2 ≥ 0, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

Case 2: |x| < 1/2. Then |x| - 1/2 < 0, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) is a piecewise function:
- For |x| ≥ 1/2: f(x) = |x| - 1/2
- For |x| < 1/2: f(x) = 1/2 - |x|

So, it's a V-shape with a dip in the middle. The vertex is at (0, 1/2), and it slopes up on either side, reaching 0 at x = ±1/2.

Similarly, let's analyze g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.

Same structure: inner absolute value, subtract 1/4, then absolute value again.

So, again, let's find the expression in different intervals.

g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.

The inner function |x| - 1/4 is zero when |x| = 1/4, i.e., x = ±1/4.

So, for |x| ≥ 1/4: g(x) = |x| - 1/4

For |x| < 1/4: g(x) = 1/4 - |x|

So, the graph of g(x) is another V-shape, with a dip in the middle. Vertex at (0, 1/4), slopes up on either side, reaching zero at x = ±1/4.

Alright, so now both f and g are understood. Now, let's see what 4g(f(...)) would look like.

Given that f is applied first, then g, and then scaled by 4.

Let me first consider the composition f(sin(2πx)).

Wait, the function is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's see.

Similarly, the other equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So both equations involve these compositions of f and g, applied to sine and cosine functions, and then scaled by 4.

Hmm, this seems complex, but perhaps we can analyze it by breaking down the functions step by step.

First, let's consider the innermost functions: sin(2πx) and cos(3πy).

Sin(2πx) has a period of 1, since the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k. So here, 2πx has k=2π, so period is 1.

Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2π/(3π) = 2/3.

Wait, so sin(2πx) varies between -1 and 1, as does cos(3πy).

Next, f is applied to these sine and cosine functions. Let's see what f does to a variable.

Given f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

The input to f is sin(2πx) for the first equation and cos(3πy) for the second.

Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are both between -1 and 1, let's see what f does to a value in [-1,1].

Let me compute f(z) for z in [-1,1].

Given that z is between -1 and 1, |z| is between 0 and 1.

So, |z| - 1/2 can be negative or non-negative.

So, for |z| >= 1/2, f(z) = |z| - 1/2.

For |z| < 1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - |
