Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape, right? The sphere has a radius of 11. 

The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

First, let me visualize this. A torus is a surface of revolution, so it has two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, the generating circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from its center to the axis is 6. So, R = 6 and r = 3.

The sphere has a radius of 11, so its center is at some point, and the torus can be inside or outside of it.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent internally, the sphere is larger, so the point of tangency is on the inner side of the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is smaller, but wait, no, the sphere has a fixed radius of 11. Wait, no, when the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, it's externally tangent, meaning the sphere is inside the torus?

Wait, actually, the sphere is fixed with radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere from the inside, and when it's outside, it's touching from the outside. Hmm, but the torus is a surface, so when it's inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the point of contact would be on the outer part of the torus's tube, and when it's outside, the sphere is inside the torus's hole? Wait, no, the sphere is 11, the torus's major radius is 6, so the sphere is larger than the torus's major radius. So, when the torus is inside, it's like a donut sitting inside a bigger sphere, touching at a certain circle. When it's outside, the sphere is inside the donut's hole, touching along another circle.

Wait, but the torus is made by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So the major radius is 6, minor radius is 3. The sphere has radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, their surfaces are tangent, and the point of contact is a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, they are tangent along another circle.

I need to find the radii of these two circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

I think I can
