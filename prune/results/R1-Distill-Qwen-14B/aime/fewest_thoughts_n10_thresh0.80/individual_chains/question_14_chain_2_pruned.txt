Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. 

Let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. I need the greatest such number, so I should start checking from 9999 downwards, but that might take too long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. Since N is four digits, let's denote N as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A ≠ 0 (since it's a four-digit number).

So, if I replace A with 1, the number becomes 1BCD, and this should be divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, which is divisible by 7. Replacing C gives AB1D, and replacing D gives ABC1, all of which must be divisible by 7.

Hmm. So each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7. Let me write this out mathematically.

First, let me express N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we replace A with 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this number N1.

Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Let's call this N2.

Replacing C with 1 gives 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Let's call this N3.

Replacing D with 1 gives 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod7, N2 ≡0 mod7, N3≡0 mod7, N4≡0 mod7.

I can set up equations for each:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

Hmm, maybe I can express each of these modulo 7 and see what constraints they impose on A, B, C, D.

First, let's compute the values of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7 because these coefficients are important.

Compute 1000 mod7: 1000 divided by 7 is 142*7=994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 /7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, because 10 -7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So now, let's rewrite each equation modulo7.

Equation 1: 1000 + 100B +10C + D ≡ 0 mod7
→ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation 2: 1000A +100 +10C + D ≡0 mod7
→ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation3: 1000A +100B +10 + D ≡0 mod7
→6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation4: 1000A +100B +10C +1 ≡0 mod7
→6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So now, we have four equations:

1. 6 + 2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7. → (2B +3C + D) ≡1 mod7. (since 6 ≡ -1, so -1 + (2B +3C +D) ≡0 → 2B +3C +D ≡1)

Wait, no, wait: 6 + ... ≡0 → ... ≡-6 mod7 → ... ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7). So equation1: 2B +3C +D ≡1 mod7.

Equation2: 6A +2 +3C +D ≡0 → 6A +3C + D ≡-2 mod7 → which is 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7 (since -2 ≡5 mod7).

Equation3:6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 →6A +2B + D ≡-3 mod7 →6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7 (since -3=4 mod7).

Equation4:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 →6A +2B +3C ≡-1 mod7 →6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 (since -1=6 mod7).

So now the four equations are:

1. 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7. (eq1)
2. 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7. (eq2)
3. 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7. (eq3)
4. 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7. (eq4)

Hmm. Maybe I can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let me see if I can find relationships between these equations.

First, let's look at eq1 and eq2.

From eq1: 2B +3C + D ≡1.

From eq2:6A +3C + D ≡5.

If I subtract eq1 from eq2:

(6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) ≡5-1 →6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Simplify 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

I can factor 2: 2(3A - B) ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7).

So multiply both sides by 4:

(3A - B) ≡4*4=16≡2 mod7.

So 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Let me note this as equation5: 3A - B ≡2 mod7. (eq5)

Similarly, let's look at eq3 and eq4.

From eq3:6A +2B + D ≡4.

From eq4:6A +2B +3C ≡6.

Subtract eq3 from eq4:

(6A +2B +3C) - (6A +2B + D) ≡6 -4 →3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So equation6:3C - D ≡2 mod7. (eq6)

Now, from eq1: 2B +3C + D ≡1.

But from eq6, D ≡3C -2 mod7.

Let me substitute D into eq1.

So eq1 becomes: 2B +3C + (3C -2) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify: 2B +6C -2 ≡1 →2B +6C ≡3 mod7.

We can factor 2B +6C → 2B +6C = 2(B +3C).

So 2(B +3C) ≡3 mod7.

Again, multiply both sides by inverse of 2, which is 4.

So (B +3C) ≡3*4=12≡5 mod7.

Thus, equation7: B +3C ≡5 mod7. (eq7)

From equation5: 3A - B ≡2 mod7 → B ≡3A -2 mod7.

From equation7: B +3C ≡5 mod7. Substitute B from equation5 into equation7.

So (3A -2) +3C ≡5 mod7 →3A +3C ≡5 +2=7≡0 mod7.

So 3A +3C ≡0 mod7 → 3(A + C) ≡0 mod7.

Since 3 and 7 are coprime, this implies A + C ≡0 mod7.

So equation8: A + C ≡0 mod7. (eq8)

So A + C is a multiple of 7. Since A and C are digits (0-9), A + C can be 0,7,14, etc. But since A is at least 1 (as it's a four-digit number), the possible sums are 7 or 14.

But if A + C =7, then C=7 -A.

If A + C=14, then C=14 -A. But since A is a digit (1-9), 14 -A would mean C=14 -A, which for A=5, C=9; A=6, C=8; A=7, C=7; A=8, C=6; A=9, C=5. But if A is 10 or above, but it can't be. So possible for A from 5 to 9, C=14 -A.

Wait, but A is from 1 to9, so if A + C=14, then A can be 5 to9, since 5+9=14, 6+8=14, etc. For A=4, C=10 which is invalid. So only A>=5.

So, equation8: Either A + C=7 or A + C=14.

So that's a constraint.

Let me see if I can relate other equations to find more relationships.

From equation5: B=3A -2 mod7. So B ≡3A -2 mod7.

But B is a digit from 0 to9, so perhaps I can write B= (3A -2) +7k, where k is integer such that B remains between 0 and9.

Similarly, from equation6: D=3C -2 mod7. So D= (3C -2) +7m, where m is integer such that D is between0 and9.

Also, from equation7: B +3C=5 mod7. But from equation5, B=3A -2 mod7, so substituting, (3A -2) +3C ≡5 mod7 →3A +3C ≡7≡0 mod7, which is equation8.

So, let's proceed.

Given that equation8, either A + C=7 or 14.

Let me consider both cases separately.

Case1: A + C=7.

Case2: A + C=14.

Let me start with Case1: A + C=7.

From equation5: B=3A -2 mod7.

So, B can be expressed as 3A -2, but since B is a digit (0-9), and 3A can be 3,6,9,... up to 27 (if A=9, 3*9=27). So 3A -2 could be from 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25.

But since B must be between0 and9, we can have B= (3A -2) mod7. Wait, because the equation was B ≡3A -2 mod7, so B can be equal to 3A -2 plus a multiple of 7, but it must be 0-9.

So for example, if 3A -2 is say 10, then B can be 3 (10-7=3) or 10, but 10 is invalid because B is a single digit. So B=3.

Similarly, if 3A -2=13, then B=6 (13-7=6) or 13, which is invalid. So B=6.

So for each A from1 to9 (since A + C=7, C=7 -A, so A can be 1 to7, because C can't be negative or more than9. Wait, if A=1, C=6; A=2, C=5; ... A=7, C=0. So A can be from1 to7.

So for each A from1 to7, let's compute B= (3A -2) mod7, and then choose the smallest non-negative residue, but also considering that B must be a digit (0-9). So let's compute B for each A:

A=1: B=3*1 -2=1 →1 mod7=1. So B=1.

A=2: 3*2 -2=4 →4 mod7=4. B=4.

A=3: 3*3-2=7 →7 mod7=0. B=0.

A=4: 3*4-2=10 →10 mod7=3. So B=3.

A=5:3*5-2=13→13 mod7=6. So B=6.

A=6:3*6-2=16→16 mod7=2. So B=2.

A=7:3*7-2=19→19 mod7=5. So B=5.

So for each A in 1-7, B is 1,4,0,3,6,2,5 respectively.

Also, from equation6: D=3C -2 mod7.

C=7 -A, so:

For each A=1 to7, C=6,5,4,3,2,1,0.

Compute 3C -2 for each:

A=1: C=6 →3*6 -2=16 →16 mod7=2 →D=2.

A=2: C=5→3*5-2=13→13 mod7=6→D=6.

A=3: C=4→3*4-2=10→10 mod7=3→D=3.

A=4: C=3→3*3 -2=7→7 mod7=0→D=0.

A=5: C=2→3*2 -2=4→4 mod7=4→D=4.

A=6: C=1→3*1 -2=1→1 mod7=1→D=1.

A=7: C=0→3*0 -2= -2 →-2 mod7=5→D=5.

So for each A=1 to7, D is 2,6,3,0,4,1,5 respectively.

So now, in case1, where A + C=7, for each A from1 to7, we have B and D determined.

So the number N is ABCD, with A from1 to7, B as above, C=7-A, D as above.

Now, our goal is to find the largest such N.

So we need to maximize N, which is a four-digit number, so higher A is better.

So in case1, A can be up to7.

Let me check for A=7.

A=7: B=5, C=0, D=5.

So N=7505
