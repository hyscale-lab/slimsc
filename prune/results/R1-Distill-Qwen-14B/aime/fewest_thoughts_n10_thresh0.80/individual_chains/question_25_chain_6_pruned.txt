Okay, so I've got this math problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is a given. So that's one item everyone has. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. 

Additionally, it mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these four items, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four. Hmm, this sounds like a problem that involves sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

I remember that the inclusion-exclusion principle helps in calculating the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. But wait, in this problem, we have more information about the number of people owning exactly two or exactly three items. Maybe I can use that instead of dealing with all the intersections directly.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Total residents (n) = 900

- Number owning a diamond ring (D) = 195

- Number owning a set of golf clubs (G) = 367

- Number owning a garden spade (S) = 562

- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so n(C) = 900.

- Number of people owning exactly two items = 437

- Number of people owning exactly three items = 234

We need to find the number of people owning all four items, which is n(D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C). 

But wait, since everyone owns C, maybe it's easier to think of everything in terms of C. Since C is universal (everyone has it), the problem reduces to finding those who have D, G, S, and C (which is all four items). But since C is already owned by everyone, the problem is effectively about the intersection of D, G, S, and C. 

Alternatively, since C is included in all, the four-item ownership is just the intersection of the other three. But maybe I should model it using inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since C is everyone, perhaps it's better to model D, G, S with the context that everyone has C.

In any case, let's try to structure this with what we know. 

Let me denote the number of people who own exactly k items as follows:

- Let a = number who own exactly 1 item (but wait, everyone owns C, so no one owns exactly 0 items without C. Wait, but all four items include C, so the other items are optional. So if someone owns exactly one item, it must be C? No, wait, because C is already given to everyone. Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, hold on. The problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So C is universal.
