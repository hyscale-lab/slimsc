Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The first graph is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and the second is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem says f(x) is ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So both are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract 1/2 or 1/4, and then take the absolute value again. That means these functions are piecewise linear and will have corners where the inner absolute value expressions change sign.

Let me sketch what f(x) and g(x) look like. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:

- When |x| >= 1/2, the inner absolute value |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.
- When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So f(x) is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at |x|=1/2, going upwards on either side. The minimum value is 0 at x=±1/2, and it increases as |x| moves away from 1/2.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|:

- When |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.
- When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So g(x) has a V-shape with its vertex at |x|=1/4, minimum value 0 at x=±1/4, and increasing as |x| moves away.

Now, f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(sin(2πx))) would involve composing these functions. Let's take it step by step.

First, consider sin(2πx). The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and since it's sin(2πx), it has a period of 1. So as x increases, the function sin(2πx) completes a full cycle every interval of length 1.

So, sin(2πx) will vary between -1 and 1. Then, when we apply f to it, we have f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

Wait, so first, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then, subtract 1/2. So when |sin(2πx)| is >= 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So, f(sin(2πx)) will have a wave-like pattern, but modulated by the absolute value functions. Similarly, g(f(sin(2πx))) would take this output and apply g to it.

Since g takes whatever input it gets and applies ||input| - 1/4|, let's see: if the input to g is between -1/4 and 1/4, g(input) = 1/4 - |input|. Otherwise, it's |input| - 1/4.

But in our case, the input to g is f(sin(2πx)), which we can figure out from the above. Let's think about the range of f(sin(2πx)):

f(sin(2πx)) is || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

The inner |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | is between 0 and 1/2. How?

- When |sin(2πx)| is 1, f(sin(2πx)) is |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- When |sin(2πx)| is 0, f(sin(2πx)) is |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- When |sin(2πx)| is 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) is 0.

So, f(sin(2πx)) varies between 0 and 1/2. So, the input to g is between 0 and 1/2. Therefore, when we compute g(f(sin(2πx))), since the input to g is between 0 and 1/2 (so |input| is same as input, since it's positive), then:

g(input) = |input - 1/4|. Because for input >= 1/4, it's input - 1/4, and for input < 1/4, it's 1/4 - input.

So, g(f(sin(2πx))) is:

- If f(sin(2πx)) >= 1/4, which would be when || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 | >= 1/4. Hmm, that's a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the entire expression 4*g(f(sin(2πx))).

Since the input to g is between 0 and 1/2, and g is |input - 1/4|, which is either (1/4 - input) if input < 1/4, or (input - 1/4) if input >= 1/4.

So, 4*g(...) would be:

- 4*(1/4 - input) = 1 - 4*input when input < 1/4.
- 4*(input - 1/4) = 4*input - 1 when input >= 1/4.

So, 4*g(f(sin(2πx))) is a piecewise function:

- When f(sin(2πx)) < 1/4, it's 1 - 4*f(sin(2πx)).
- When f(sin(2πx)) >= 1/4, it's 4*f(sin(2πx)) - 1.

Hmm, okay. So, for the first graph, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), which is 4*g(f(...)), which we just analyzed.

So, perhaps I can write y as a function of x, and then set that equal to x (since the other equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))), but wait, no, the other equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Wait, so we have two equations:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

We need to find the number of intersection points between these two graphs. That is, points (a, b) where b = 4 g(f(sin(2πa))) and a = 4 g(f(cos(3πb))).

So, for such a point (a, b), both equations must hold. So, we have:

b = 4 g(f(sin(2πa)))
a = 4 g(f(cos(3πb)))

So, substituting the second into the first, perhaps? Or maybe find a relationship between a and b.

This seems a bit tricky because it's a system of equations with both a and b defined in terms of each other.

Alternatively, perhaps think of it as a mapping: for each x, compute y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), and for each y, compute x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). The intersections would be where x and y satisfy both equations.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can analyze the possible ranges and periodicity.

First, let's consider the functions involved.

The function y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) is periodic with period 1, because sin(2πx) has period 1. Similarly, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) depends on cos(3πy), which has period 2/3 because cos(3πy) completes a cycle every 2/3 in y.

So, perhaps the system has a period of 1 in x and 2/3 in y, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to consider the ranges of the functions.

Let me find the possible values of y and x.

For y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))):

We already have f(sin(2πx)) between 0 and
