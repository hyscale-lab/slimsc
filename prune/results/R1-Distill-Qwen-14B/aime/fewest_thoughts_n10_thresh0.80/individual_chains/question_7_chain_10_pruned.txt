Okay, so I have this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention the probability is m/n, and I need to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each of which is colored red or blue independently. So each vertex has two choices, leading to a total of 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. That's the denominator of our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation (by some multiple of 45 degrees, since 360/8=45) such that when we rotate the octagon, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. In other words, the set of blue vertices is mapped to the set of red vertices by some rotation.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so rotations can align the colorings in different ways. So each rotation corresponds to a cyclic shift of the vertices. Let me think about group theory for a moment. The rotational symmetries of the octagon form a cyclic group of order 8, generated by a rotation of 45 degrees. Each element of this group is a rotation by k*45 degrees for k=0,1,...,7.

So for a given coloring, we need to check if there's some rotation (i.e., some group element) that transforms the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. But wait, the set of blue and red vertices must form a partition of the octagon's vertices. So if the blue vertices are mapped to the red ones, that implies that the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices? Because each blue is mapped to a red, so the size must be the same. Therefore, the number of blue vertices is equal to the number of red vertices. So the coloring must have exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices.

Wait, because if you have a rotation that maps blue to red, then the number of blue must equal the number of red. Otherwise, the mapping can't be bijective. Because if, say, you had 5 blue and 3 red, you can't have a bijection between them. So
