Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter what Alice does.

Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So the goal is to determine for each n whether it's a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Since Alice goes first, if the starting position is a losing position for her, Bob can win with the right strategy.

I think the way to approach this is to model the game and find a pattern or formula that determines whether a position is a winning or losing one. Let's start by examining small values of n and see if we can spot a pattern.

Let's list out n from 0 upwards and mark whether each is a winning (W) or losing (L) position. Wait, n=0 would be an empty stack, so the game is over. But in this case, the last token was taken by the previous player, so n=0 would be a losing position for the player about to move because they can't move. So n=0 is a losing position.

Wait, but in our problem, n is the number of tokens before the game starts. So when the game starts, if n=0, the game is already over, so that's probably not relevant here. Let's consider n starting from 1.

n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice. So Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 token. Then Bob is forced to take that 1 token and win. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if Alice takes 1 from n=2, leaving 1, then Bob can take that 1 and win. But if Alice takes 4 tokens, she can't because there are only 2. So Alice's only move from n=2 is to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Alice would lose. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which means it's a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who can then take it and win. So Alice loses. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice (Bob's win). So that would be a position where Bob can win.

Wait, let me clarify: when we say a position is a losing position for
