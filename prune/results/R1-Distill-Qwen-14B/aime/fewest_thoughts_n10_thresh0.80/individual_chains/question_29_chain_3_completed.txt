Okay, let's see. I have this geometry problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. I'm given the lengths BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, first, I'll try to visualize the problem. There are two rectangles. Let me draw them out mentally. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC=AD=16 and AB=CD=107. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. So EF=184 and FG=17, meaning EF=GH=184 and FG=EH=17.

Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So these four points lie on a straight line. Let me try to sketch this mentally. So, point D is part of rectangle ABCD, and point E is part of rectangle EFGH. Similarly, C and F are other points.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. Maybe this implies some properties related to cyclic quadrilaterals, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees, or maybe something about power of a point.

But let's start by trying to figure out the positions of these rectangles. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the line they lie on must be one of the sides of the rectangles. Wait, but D is a corner of ABCD, and E is a corner of EFGH. So perhaps the line is a side for both rectangles? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's an extension of a side.

Let me clarify the notation. In rectangle ABCD, the order of the letters implies that AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, etc. So, points are arranged as A-B-C-D, forming a rectangle. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with points E-F-G-H.

Wait, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, in order, it's D-E-C-F on a line. So, the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. So, these four points are on a straight line in that order.

So, point D is connected to E, which is connected to C, which is connected to F. So, DE, EC, and CF are consecutive segments on this line.

I think I should assign coordinates to these points to make things clearer. Let me place the points on a coordinate system to model the problem.

Let's let point D be at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB=107, BC=16, then:

- Point D is (0,0)
- Point C, which is adjacent to D, would be at (16, 0) because BC is 16. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so if AB is 107 and BC is 16, then AB is one side and BC is another.

Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are AB and BC, so AB is length 107, BC is length 16. So, starting from A, moving to B, then to C, then to D, and back to A.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates more systematically. Let me consider point A at (a, b), then since ABCD is a rectangle, point B would be at (a + AB, b) because AB is a horizontal side. Then point C would be at (a + AB, b + BC), and point D would be at (a, b + BC).

Wait, but if I place point D at (0,0), then point C would be at (16, 0) because DC is equal to AB, which is 107, but that doesn't make sense because DC would be 107. Wait, maybe I got the sides mixed up.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So if AB is 107 and BC is 16, then CD is 107 and DA is 16. So, the rectangle is 107 units long and 16 units high.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates so that D is at (0,0). Then, since DA is 16, point A would be at (0, 16). Then AB would be 107, so point B would be at (107, 16). Then point C would be at (107, 0), because BC is 16 downward from B, which is at (107,16) so moving down 16 units to (107, 0). Wait, that makes DC 107 units, which seems correct, but let me check.

Wait, in this setup, the rectangle ABCD would have points:

- A: (0,16)
- B: (107,16)
- C: (107,0)
- D: (0,0)

Yes, that makes sense because AB is 107 (from (0,16) to (107,16)), BC is 16 (from (107,16) to (107,0)), CD is 107 (from (107,0) to (0,0)), and DA is 16 (from (0,0) to (0,16)). So this is correct.

Now, rectangle EFGH. The problem says that E, F, G, H are the vertices of another rectangle. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, lying on a straight line in that order. So, D is at (0,0), E is somewhere on the line beyond D, then C is at (107,0), and F is beyond C on the same line.

Wait, but in my current coordinate system, point C is at (107,0), which is on the x-axis. So the line D-E-C-F is the x-axis itself.

Wait, but then point E is on the x-axis. So, rectangle EFGH must have E on the x-axis.

But let me think about rectangle EFGH. The sides EF and FG are given as 184 and 17, respectively. So, EF is 184 and FG is 17.

Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular, so if EF is 184, then FG is 17, which is perpendicular to EF. So, EF is a horizontal side of length 184, and FG is a vertical side of length 17.

Wait, but in our coordinate system, if E is on the x-axis, then F would be either above or below E. But since in the problem, F is after C on the same line D-E-C-F, which is the x-axis, then F must be on the x-axis as well.

Wait, that can't be, because if E is on the x-axis, and EFGH is a rectangle, then F would be either above or below E, not on the same line unless the rectangle is degenerate, which it's not.

Wait, perhaps I've made a wrong assumption. Maybe the line D-E-C-F isn't the x-axis. Alternatively, maybe I should place the points differently.

Wait, perhaps I should adjust the coordinate system. Let me try a different approach.

Let's place point D at (0,0) as before. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB=107, BC=16, then points would be:

- A: (0, 16)
- B: (107, 16)
- C: (107, 0)
- D: (0, 0)

So, the rectangle ABCD is placed with the base DC along the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0), and height DA is 16 units up to (0,16).

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line. If I assume that this line is the x-axis, then E is to the left of D at (x,0) for some x < 0, and F is to the right of C at (107 + y, 0) for some y > 0.

But then, the rectangle EFGH must have E and F on the x-axis, and H and G somewhere else. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is one of its sides, with EF=184, so the distance between E and F is 184 units.

Wait, but in this setup, if E is at (x,0) and F is at (x + 184, 0), but since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), then E must be to the left of D, and F to the right of C.

Wait, but the line D-E-C-F has points in the order D, E, C, F. Wait, no, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, but it doesn't specify the order. Wait, actually, the problem says: "D,E,C,F are collinear." So, the order is D first, then E, then C, then F. So, the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. So, the order is D-E-C-F along the line.

Wait, but that would mean that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. But in our coordinate system, D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). So, E would have to be between D and C, so E is at some point (e, 0) where 0 < e < 107, and F is at (f, 0) where f > 107.

Wait, but then EF would be the distance from E to F, which is f - e. And the problem states that EF=184. So, f - e = 184.

But in this case, E is between D and C, so e is between 0 and 107, and F is beyond C at f = e + 184. So, for example, if e=0, then F would be at 184, but since C is at 107, that's possible. Alternatively, if e=10, then F would be at 194, etc.

But then, rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. So, FG is the next side of the rectangle, which would be perpendicular to EF. So, if EF is along the x-axis, then FG would be vertical, either upwards or downwards.

So, point F is at (f, 0), then point G would be at (f, 17) or (f, -17). Similarly, point E is at (e, 0), so point H would be at (e, 17) or (e, -17). Since it's a rectangle, the sides must be at right angles, so both H and G would be either above or below the line EF.

But the problem also states that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), and H and G are points of rectangle EFGH. So, let's see.

If H is at (e, 17) and G is at (f,17), then points A, D, H, G would be: A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17). Do these four points lie on a circle?

Alternatively, if H and G are below the x-axis, they would be at (e, -17) and (f, -17), but then the circle would have to pass through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,-17), G(f,-17). Let me check both possibilities.

But first, let's assume that the rectangle EFGH is above the x-axis, so H is at (e,17) and G is at (f,17).

Wait, but then point H is at (e,17), and G is at (f,17). So, the line HG is horizontal at y=17, and EF is at y=0.

Now, the four points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17) lie on a circle. Let me see if that's possible.

To find if four points lie on a circle, we can use the condition that the determinant of the following matrix is zero:

|x   y   x²+y²   1|
|0   16   0²+16² 1|
|0   0    0²+0²  1|
|e   17   e²+17² 1|
|f   17   f²+17² 1|

Wait, but that's a 5x4 matrix; perhaps I should set up the equation for the circle passing through three points and see if the fourth lies on it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, and H, and then check if G lies on it.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Since point A(0,16) lies on the circle:

0² + 16² + 2g*0 + 2f*16 + c = 0 → 256 + 32f + c = 0 → Equation (1): 32f + c = -256.

Point D(0,0) lies on the circle:

0² + 0² + 2g*0 + 2f*0 + c = 0 → 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 → c = 0.

Wait, that's a problem because from Equation (1), 32f + c = -256, but c=0 → 32f = -256 → f = -8.

So, the equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx - 16y = 0.

Now, check point H(e,17):

e² + 17² + 2g*e -16*17 = 0 → e² + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0 → e² + 2g e + 17 = 0 → Equation (2): e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Similarly, point G(f,17) must lie on the circle as well:

f² + 17² + 2g f -16*17 = 0 → f² + 289 + 2g f -272 = 0 → f² + 2g f + 17 = 0 → Equation (3): f² + 2g f +17 = 0.

Now, from Equations (2) and (3), we have:

e² + 2g e +17 = 0,

f² + 2g f +17 = 0.

Subtracting these two equations gives:

e² - f² + 2g (e - f) = 0 → (e - f)(e + f + 2g) = 0.

So, either e = f, which would mean E and F are the same point, which is impossible, or e + f + 2g = 0.

So, e + f + 2g = 0 → 2g = -(e + f) → g = -(e + f)/2.

Now, since E and F are points on the line D-E-C-F, which is the x-axis, and EF = 184, we have f = e + 184.

So, f = e + 184.

Now, from equation (2):

e² + 2g e +17 = 0.

Substituting g = -(e + f)/2 = -(e + (e + 184))/2 = -(2e + 184)/2 = -(e + 92).

So, g = -(e + 92).

Substituting into equation (2):

e² + 2*(-(e + 92)) * e +17 = 0 → e² - 2e(e + 92) +17 = 0.

Expanding:

e² - 2e² - 184e +17 = 0 → -e² -184e +17 = 0 → Multiply both sides by -1:

e² + 184e -17 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in e: e² + 184e -17 = 0.

Hmm, let's solve for e using the quadratic formula.

e = [-184 ± sqrt(184² + 4*17)] / 2.

Calculate discriminant:

184² = (180 +4)^2 = 180² + 2*180*4 +4² = 32400 + 1440 +16 = 32400 +1440=33840 +16=33856.

4*17=68.

So, discriminant = 33856 +68=33924.

sqrt(33924) = let's see, 184^2=33856, 185^2=34225, so sqrt(33924) is between 184 and 185.

Let me compute 184.5^2: 184^2 + 2*184*0.5 +0.5^2 =33856 + 184 +0.25= 34040.25, which is higher than 33924.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute:

184^2 =33856.

33924 -33856=68.

So, sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924).

Let me see if 184.2^2 is 33924.

184.2^2 = (184 + 0.2)^2 =184^2 + 2*184*0.2 +0.2^2 =33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64, which is higher than 33924.

Hmm, 184.1^2=?

184.1^2= (184 +0.1)^2=184^2 +2*184*0.1 +0.1^2=33856 +36.8 +0.01=33892.81.

Which is less than 33924.

The difference is 33924-33892.81=31.19.

Each 0.1 increment adds about 36.8 + (previous term) but perhaps I can compute how much more beyond 184.1.

Wait, maybe it's not a whole number, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, in the equation, when I substituted g into equation (2), I had:

e² + 2g e +17 = 0,

where g = -(e + f)/2,

and since f = e +184,

g = -(e + e +184)/2 = -(2e +184)/2 = -(e +92).

So,

e² + 2*(-(e +92)) * e +17 = 0 → e² -2e(e +92) +17=0 → e² -2e² -184e +17=0 → -e² -184e +17=0 → e² +184e -17=0.

Yes, that's correct. So, the quadratic equation is e² +184e -17=0.

So, e = [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*1*17)] / 2.

Compute discriminant: 184^2=33856, 4*17=68 → sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924).

Now, sqrt(33924) = let me see, 184*184=33856, then 184*184 +68=33924.

Wait, perhaps 184.1^2=33856 + 2*184*0.1 +0.1^2=33856 +36.8 +0.01=33892.81.

Then 184.2^2=33892.81 + (36.8 + 0.2) + 0.01=33892.81 +37 +0.01=33929.82.

Hmm, 33924 lies between 33892.81 and 33929.82.

Compute 184.1 + x)^2 =33924, where x is small.

Approximate:

(184.1 + x)^2 ≈184.1^2 + 2*184.1*x.

Set equal to 33924:

33892.81 + 368.2 x ≈33924 → 368.2 x ≈33924 -33892.81=31.19 → x≈31.19 /368.2≈0.0847.

So, sqrt(33924)≈184.1 +0.0847≈184.1847.

So, e = [ -184 ±184.1847 ] /2.

We need to find e such that E is between D and C on the x-axis. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), E must be at some point between them, so e must be between 0 and 107. But let's compute the roots.

First, e = [ -184 +184.1847 ] /2 ≈ (0.1847)/2 ≈0.09235.

Second, e = [ -184 -184.1847 ] /2 ≈ (-368.1847)/2≈-184.09235.

The second root is negative, so E would be at x≈-184.09, but that's to the left of D at (0,0), which would place E before D on the line, but the problem says the order is D-E-C-F, so E should be after D but before C. So, the positive root e≈0.09235 is acceptable.

So, e≈0.09235. Then f = e +184≈0.09235+184≈184.09235.

So, points:

E: (e, 0) ≈(0.09235, 0)

F: (f, 0)≈(184.09235, 0)

H: (e, 17)≈(0.09235,17)

G: (f,17)≈(184.09235,17)

Wait, but then point G would be at (184.09235,17), which is far to the right of point C at (107,0). But let's see if this makes sense with the circle passing through A, D, H, G.

Wait, but with these coordinates, let's check if A, D, H, G lie on a circle. But earlier, we set up the equation based on that condition, so this should satisfy it. Let me confirm.

From earlier, the equation of the circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0, with c=0, f=-8, and g=-(e +92).

With e≈0.09235, g≈-(0.09235 +92)= -92.09235.

So, the equation is x² + y² - 2*(92.09235)x -16y =0 → x² + y² -184.1847x -16y=0.

Now, let's check point G: (f,17)= (184.09235,17).

Substitute into the circle equation:

(184.09235)^2 + (17)^2 -184.1847*(184.09235) -16*(17) ≈ ?

Compute each term:

(184.09235)^2 ≈ (184.09235)^2≈ let's compute 184^2=33856, plus 2*184*0.09235 + (0.09235)^2≈33856 + 34.114 +0.0085≈33890.1225.

(17)^2=289.

-184.1847*(184.09235)= -(184.1847 * 184.09235). Let's compute this as approximately -(184^2 + 0.1847*184 + 184*0.09235 + 0.1847*0.09235). Wait, perhaps it's better to approximate 184.1847 * 184.09235 ≈ (184 + 0.1847)(184 +0.09235)=184^2 +184*(0.1847 +0.09235) +0.1847*0.09235≈33856 +184*(0.27705) +0.0171≈33856 +51.0502 +0.0171≈33907.0673.

So, -33907.0673.

Then, -16*17= -272.

Now, sum all terms:

33890.1225 + 289 -33907.0673 -272 ≈

33890.1225 +289 = 34179.1225,

34179.1225 -33907.0673≈272.0552,

272.0552 -272≈0.0552.

Hmm, that's approximately zero, which makes sense, considering some rounding errors. So, this checks out.

Now, back to the problem. I need to find CE, which is the distance between points C and E.

Point C is at (107,0), and point E is at (e,0)= (0.09235,0).

So, the distance CE is |107 - e|=107 -0.09235≈106.90765.

But since the problem is likely designed to have integer values, perhaps my assumption that the rectangle is above the x-axis is incorrect, and maybe it's below, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should consider the rectangle EFGH being below the x-axis, so points H and G are at (e, -17) and (f, -17).

Let me try this scenario.

If H is at (e, -17) and G is at (f, -17), then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,-17), G(f,-17) lie on a circle.

Let me go through the same steps.

General circle equation: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.

Point A(0,16):

0 + 256 +0 +32f +c=0 → 256 +32f +c=0 → Equation (1): 32f +c= -256.

Point D(0,0):

0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 → c=0.

From Equation (1): 32f = -256 → f= -8.

So, the equation becomes x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Point H(e,-17):

e² + (-17)^2 +2g e -16*(-17)=0 → e² + 289 +2g e +272=0 → e² +2g e +561=0 → Equation (2): e² +2g e +561=0.

Point G(f,-17):

f² + (-17)^2 +2g f -16*(-17)=0 → f² +289 +2g f +272=0 → f² +2g f +561=0 → Equation (3): f² +2g f +561=0.

Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (2):

e² - f² +2g(e - f)=0 → (e - f)(e + f +2g)=0.

Again, since e ≠ f, we have e + f +2g=0 → 2g= -(e +f) → g= -(e +f)/2.

Since EF=184, and E is at (e,0), F is at (f,0), with f = e +184.

So, f = e +184.

Substitute into equation for g: g= -(e +e +184)/2= -(2e +184)/2= -(e +92).

Now, substitute g into equation (2):

e² +2*(-(e+92)) *e +561=0 → e² -2e(e +92) +561=0 → e² -2e² -184e +561=0 → -e² -184e +561=0 → Multiply by -1: e² +184e -561=0.

Now, solve this quadratic equation: e² +184e -561=0.

Using quadratic formula:

e = [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*561)] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

184^2=33856,

4*561=2244,

sqrt(33856 +2244)=sqrt(36100)=190.

So, e = [-184 ±190]/2.

Two solutions:

1. e=( -184 +190 )/2=6/2=3.

2. e=( -184 -190 )/2= (-374)/2= -187.

We can discard the negative solution because E must lie between D(0,0) and C(107,0), so e must be between 0 and 107. So, e=3.

So, e=3, f=3+184=187.

Now, check if this setup satisfies the circle condition.

So, points:

E: (3,0),

F: (187,0),

H: (3,-17),

G: (187,-17).

Now, the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), and G(187,-17).

Let me confirm this.

The equation of the circle is x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0.

From earlier, c=0, f=-8, and g= -(e +92)= -(3 +92)= -95.

So, the equation is x² + y² -190x -16y=0.

Let's check point G(187,-17):

187² + (-17)^2 -190*187 -16*(-17) = ?

Compute each term:

187² = (200 -13)^2 = 200² -2*200*13 +13²=40000 -5200 +169=40000-5200=34800 +169=34969.

(-17)^2=289.

-190*187= let's compute 190*187: 190*(180+7)=190*180=34200, 190*7=1330 → total 34200+1330=35530. So, -35530.

-16*(-17)=272.

So, total:34969 +289 -35530 +272.

Compute step by step:

34969 +289=35258.

35258 -35530= -272.

-272 +272=0.

Perfect, so it lies on the circle.

Now, the problem states that A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which is satisfied.

So, with this configuration, E is at (3,0), C is at (107,0), so CE is the distance between (107,0) and (3,0), which is |107 -3|=104.

So, CE=104.

Wait, that's an integer, which makes sense for the problem.

Earlier, when I assumed the rectangle was above the x-axis, I got CE≈106.9076, which is not an integer, so likely incorrect. The correct configuration is when the rectangle EFGH is below the x-axis, making CE=104.

So, the length of CE is 104.


To solve the problem, we start by assigning coordinates to the points of rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$. Place $D$ at the origin $(0,0)$, $C$ at $(107,0)$, $B$ at $(107,16)$, and $A$ at $(0,16)$. Points $D$, $E$, $C$, and $F$ are collinear on the x-axis, with $E$ between $D$ and $C$, and $F$ beyond $C$.

Given $EF = 184$, $E$ is at $(e,0)$ and $F$ is at $(e+184,0)$. The problem states that $A$, $D$, $H$, and $G$ lie on a circle. Assuming $EFGH$ is below the x-axis, $H$ is at $(e,-17)$ and $G$ is at $(e+184,-17)$.

The circle passing through $A(0,16)$, $D(0,0)$, $H(e,-17)$, and $G(e+184,-17)$ satisfies the equation $x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$. Substituting these points, we find $c = 0$, $f = -8$, and $g = -(e + 92)$. Substituting into the circle equation, we solve for $e$ and find $e = 3$. Thus, $F$ is at $(187,0)$.

Finally, the distance $CE$ is the distance between $C(107,0)$ and $E(3,0)$, which is $|107 - 3| = 104$.

$\boxed{104}$
