Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about the probability that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices.

Hmm, let me try to parse this. So initially, all vertices are either red or blue. After some rotation, the blue ones should align with the previously red positions. That probably means that the set of blue vertices must be a rotated version of the set of red vertices. Or maybe another way to think about it is that the blue and red sets are rotationally equivalent.

Wait, so if I imagine the octagon, it's regular, so it has rotational symmetry. So the coloring needs to be such that the blue vertices can be rotated to match the red ones. That is, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the red vertices.

But another way to think about it is that the entire coloring is symmetric in such a way that the blue and red sets can be rotated into each other. So perhaps the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices? Because otherwise, you can't rotate them to match.

Wait, but the octagon has 8 vertices. So if there are k blue vertices, there are 8 - k red ones. For the rotation to make all blue vertices align with red positions, the number of blue and red vertices must be the same, so k must be 4. Because if you have, say, 3 blue and 5 red, you can't rotate to make all blue ones match the red ones, since 3 â‰  5. So that suggests that the number of blue vertices must be 4.

Wait, but is that necessarily the case? Suppose we have a different number, say 2 blue and 6 red. Could the two blue vertices be arranged in such a way that a rotation moves them to two red positions? But the original number of red and blue vertices would have to be equal for that to happen, right? Because if you rotate, the number of blue vertices doesn't change. So if you need all blue vertices to be on red positions, then the number of blue must be equal to the number of red, so 4 each.

So that gives me a starting point. The probability we're looking for is conditional on the number of blue vertices being exactly 4. Because otherwise
