Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The problem defines two functions, f(x) and g(x), and then uses them to create these two equations:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

I need to figure out how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let's write down what f(x) and g(x) are:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

So both f and g are absolute value functions with some transformations. I think I should first understand what these functions look like.

Starting with f(x):

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|

The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2, which shifts the graph down by 1/2. But then taking the absolute value of that, so wherever |x| - 1/2 is negative, it becomes positive. So the graph will have a V-shape that's "folded" at the point where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = ±1/2. Let me sketch this mentally:

- For |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.
- For |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that has its vertex at (0, 1/2), then decreases until x = ±1/2, where it reaches 0, and then increases again beyond that.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this:

Again, starting with |x|, subtracting 1/4, then taking the absolute value.

- For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.
- For |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So the graph of g(x) is a V-shape with vertex at (0, 1/4), decreasing until |x|=1/4, then increasing beyond that.

Now, the functions inside the equations involve compositions of f and g. Let's take the first function:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

Let's parse this step by step.

First, compute sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1, since the argument is 2πx. So sin(2πx) will oscillate between -1 and 1 as x varies.

Then, apply f to this: f(sin(2πx)).

So f takes the sine value, which is between -1 and 1, and applies the transformation f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Wait, let's think about what f does to sin(2πx). Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

So, let's compute f(sin(2πx)):

Case 1: |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2. Then f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2.

Case 2: |sin(2πx)| < 1/2. Then f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So the output of f(sin(2πx)) will be in the range [0, 1/2], because:

- When |sin(2πx)| is 1, f(sin(2πx)) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.
- When |sin(2πx)| is 0, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2.
Wait, that can't be right. Wait, when |sin(2πx)| is 0, it's 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 1, it's 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Hmm, interesting. So the function f(sin(2πx)) is always between 0 and 1/2?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, let's recheck.

Suppose |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1.

Then f(sin(2πx)) is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

So the expression inside is |t - 1/2| where t is between 0 and 1.

So when t is in [0, 1/2], |t - 1/2| = 1/2 - t, which goes from 1/2 to 0.

When t is in [1/2, 1], |t - 1/2| = t - 1/2, which goes from 0 to 1/2.

So overall, f(sin(2πx)) varies between 0 and 1/2, as t moves from 0 to 1.

So the output is always between 0 and 1/2.

Then, g is applied to this. So g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(t), where t is between 0 and 1/2.

But g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|.

So since t is between 0 and 1/2, |t| is t, so g(t) = |t - 1/4|.

So for t in [0, 1/4], |t - 1/4| = 1/4 - t.

For t in [1/4, 1/2], |t - 1/4| = t - 1/4.

So g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that starts at g(0) = 1/4, decreases to 0 at t=1/4, then increases back to 1/4 - 1/2 = ?

Wait, wait, let's compute g(t):

g(t) = |t - 1/4|.

So when t is 0: g(0) = 1/4.

At t=1/4: g(1/4)=0.

At t=1/2: g(1/2)=1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

So the graph of g(t) is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, starting at 1/4 when t=0, going down to 0 at t=1/4, then going back up to 1/4 at t=1/2.

So g(f(sin(2πx))) is then scaled by 4 in the first equation:

y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))

So 4 times g(t), where t is between 0 and 1/2. So the maximum value of g(t) is 1/4, so 4 * (1/4) = 1. So y ranges between 0 and 1.

So for each x, y is determined by this expression.

Now, the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Similarly, let's break this down.

First, compute cos(3πy). The cosine function has a period of 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So as y varies, cos(3πy) will oscillate between -1 and 1 with a period of 2/3.

Then, apply f to this: f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|.

Again, |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, so f(cos(3πy)) is ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|, which as before, is between 0 and 1/2.

Then, apply g to that: g(f(cos(3πy))) = | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 - 1/4 |? Wait, no. Wait, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|.

Wait, no: g(f(cos(3πy))) = | | [f(cos(3πy))] | - 1/4 |. Wait, f(cos(3πy)) is already non-negative because it's an absolute value. So g(f(...)) is | (f(...) - 1/4) |.

But f(cos(3πy)) is between 0 and 1/2, so let's see:

If f(...) is in [0, 1/4], then g(f(...)) = 1/4 - f(...).

If f(...) is in [1/4, 1/2], then g(f(...)) = f(...) - 1/4.

So, similar to the previous function, g(f(cos(3πy))) will vary between 0 and 1/4.

Then, multiply by 4: 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) will vary between 0 and 1.

So x is determined by this expression.

So both equations map x to y and y to x, each ranging between 0 and 1.

So now, the problem is to find the number of points (x, y) such that:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, to find the intersections, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously.

Hmm, this seems tricky because each equation is a function of the other variable. So perhaps we can write them as a system and try to find solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the period of each function to find how many intersections occur within a certain range and then extrapolate.

Wait, let's think about the periodicity.

For the first equation, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), since sin(2πx) has a period of 1, but x is in the argument of the outer function as well. Let's see:

But 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that has period 1/2, maybe? Let's see:

Because sin(2πx) has period 1, but because inside f, which is symmetric, maybe the overall function has a smaller period.

Wait, f(sin(2πx)) is symmetric about x and x + 1/2?

Wait, perhaps the period is 1, since sin(2π(x + 1)) = sin(2πx + 2π) = sin(2πx). So f(sin(
