Okay, so I have this geometry problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We’re given the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, first, maybe I should draw a rough sketch or at least get the triangle's properties clear. Let me note that in triangle ABC, AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. So, sides are 5, 9, 10. Is this a right-angled triangle?

Let me check using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's see: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10² = 100. So, no, it's not a right-angled triangle. Okay, so just a scalene triangle.

Since ABC is inscribed in circle ω, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. So, ω has all three vertices A, B, C on its circumference.

Now, the tangents at B and C meet at D. Tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if I let O be the center of ω, then OB is perpendicular to the tangent at B, and similarly, OC is perpendicular to the tangent at C.

So, the point D lies at the intersection of these two tangents. Therefore, D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents from B and C.

AD intersects ω again at P, so starting from A, going through D, and hitting the circle again at P. We need to find AP.

I remember that when a tangent and a secant (or another tangent) are involved, there are some theorems that relate lengths, like the power of a point.

Power of a Point says that for point D outside the circle ω, the power is equal to DB² = DC², since both are tangents from D to ω.

Wait, right, because the lengths of tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, DB = DC.

So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Also, point D lies on the tangents at B and C, so it's the external point from which tangents are drawn to ω.

Now, looking at point A, which is on ω, and line AD passes through D and intersects ω again at P. So, AD is a secant of the circle ω, and D is outside the circle.

So, by the Power of a Point theorem for point D with respect to circle ω, we can write:

DB² = DA * DP

Because the power of D is equal to the product of the lengths from D to A and D to P along the secant line.

So, DB² = DA * DP.

But since we need AP, which is the length from A to P, we can write AP = AD - DP or AD + DP, depending on the positions.

Wait, actually, since AD is a line from A passing through D and then hitting the circle again at P, the order of points is A, then D outside, then P. Wait, no. Wait, A is on the circle, and D is outside. So, when we draw AD, starting from A, it goes outside to D, then goes back into the circle at P? Wait, that can't be. Or does it? Wait, no, because D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, so if you draw AD from A, it goes through D, which is outside the circle, so the intersection with the circle again would be on the other side of D from A.

Wait, maybe I should think about the order: A is on the circle, then moving along AD, you exit the circle at A, go towards D, which is outside, then enter the circle again at P. Hmm, but that's not possible because A is already on the circle. Wait, no, actually, the secant would start at A, go through D, and then intersect the circle again at P. So, the order would be A, then D, then P. Wait, but D is outside the circle, so the line AD passes through A (on the circle), then exits the circle, goes to D, and then... Wait, but once you leave the circle, you can't enter again the same way. So perhaps P is between A and D? That doesn't make sense because D is outside.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Let's say point A is on the circle. The line AD starts at A, goes through D (which is outside the circle), and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the order is A, then D, then P? No, that can't be because P is another intersection point on the circle. Wait, maybe the order is D, then A, then P? Because if you start from D, the line DA would first intersect the circle at A, then go through to P. So, the points along AD from D are D, then A, then P. So, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which is longer than DA, passing through A.

So, DA is part of DP. So, DP = DA + AP.

Wait, let me clarify: If we have point D outside the circle, and line DP intersects the circle at A and P. So, starting from D, the line goes through A, then P. So, the order is D, A, P along the line AD. So, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DP = DA + AP. Therefore, AP = DP - DA.

But according to the Power of a Point theorem, DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DP, then AP = DP - DA.

Alternatively, since we can write DB² = DA * DP, and if we can find DB, then we can relate DA and DP.

But first, maybe we can find DA.

Wait, but to find DA, we might need more information. So perhaps we can find DA using some other geometric properties.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry or trigonometry.

But before jumping into that, perhaps using properties of triangle ABC.

Given the sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, perhaps we can compute angles or other lengths.

Wait, another thought: Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, perhaps triangle DBC is isoceles with DB=DC, as we said before.

Also, point D lies on the tangents at B and C, so BD and CD are tangents.

Also, point A is on the circle, so perhaps we can use properties of poles and polars or harmonic division or something, but maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, maybe using inversion, but I think that's overkill.

Wait, perhaps using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem?

Wait, perhaps we can find coordinates
