Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. Once I have that p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Alright, let's break this down. Maybe I should start by considering small primes and see if any of them satisfy the condition that p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n.

I know that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes start at 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.

So, the first step is to check each prime starting from the smallest. For each prime p, I need to see if there's an integer n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². If such an n exists, then p is a candidate, and I want the smallest such p.

Let me start with p=2. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4.

Compute n⁴ +1 mod 4:

For n=1: 1 +1 =2 mod4, which is 2, not 0.

n=2: 16 +1=17 mod4=1, not 0.

n=3: 81 +1=82 mod4=2, not 0.

n=4: 256 +1=257 mod4=1, not 0.

Wait, since 4 is 2², we can compute n⁴ mod4 for any n.

But n can be either even or odd.

If n is even, n=2k, then n⁴ =16k⁴, which is 0 mod4. So n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod4.

If n is odd, n=2k+1, then n²=4k²+4k+1≡1 mod4. Then n⁴=(n²)² ≡1²=1 mod4. So n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod4.

So, for p=2, n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2 mod4, never 0. So 2²=4 doesn't divide any n⁴ +1. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is p=3. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9.

Compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod9 repeats every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9; 1+1=2≠0

n=2: 16 mod9=7; 7+1=8≠0

n=3: 81 mod9=0; 0+1=1≠0

n=4: 4⁴=256 mod9: 256 /9=28*9=252, 256-252=4; 4+1=5≠0

n=5: 5⁴=625 mod9: 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4; 4+1=5≠0

n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod9=0; 0+1=1≠0

n=7: 7⁴=2401 mod9. Let's compute 7 mod9 is 7. 7²=49 mod9=4, 7⁴=(7²)²=4²=16 mod9=7. So 7 +1=8≠0.

n=8: 8 mod9=8. 8²=64 mod9=1, so 8⁴=(8²)²=1²=1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0.

So for p=3, no n from 1 to 8 satisfies the condition n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod9. So p=3 is out.

Next prime is 5. Let's check if there exists an n such that n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24 (since mod25 repeats every 25 numbers). But maybe I can find a pattern or use Euler's theorem.

Euler's theorem says that if n and 25 are coprime, then n^φ(25)=n^20≡1 mod25. So n^20≡1 mod25, so n^4 is a 5th root of unity in mod25? Hmm, not sure.

But maybe it's easier to just compute n^4 mod25 for small n.

n=1: 1 mod25; 1+1=2≠0

n=2: 16 mod25; 16+1=17≠0

n=3: 81 mod25=6; 6+1=7≠0

n=4: 256 mod25=256-10*25=256-250=6; 6+1=7≠0

n=5: 0 mod25; 0+1=1≠0

n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod25: 1296 /25=51*25=1275; 1296-1275=21; 21+1=22≠0

n=7: 7⁴=2401 mod25: 2401-96*25=2401-2400=1; 1+1=2≠0

n=8: 8⁴=4096 mod25: 4096 - 163*25=4096-4075=21; 21+1=22≠0

n=9: 9⁴=6561 mod25: 6561 /25=
