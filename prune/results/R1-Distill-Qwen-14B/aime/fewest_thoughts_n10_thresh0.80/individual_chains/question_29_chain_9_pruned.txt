Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because sometimes drawing a diagram helps, but since I can't draw right now, I'll have to imagine it.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic or lie on the same circle, which means they form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184. I need to find CE.

First, let me recall some properties of rectangles. All angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, for rectangle ABCD, AB is equal to CD, and BC is equal to AD. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF is equal to GH, and FG is equal to EH.

Let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16, which is one side of rectangle ABCD. So, since ABCD is a rectangle, AD = BC = 16.
- AB = 107, which is the other side of ABCD. So, AB = CD = 107.
- FG = 17, which is a side of rectangle EFGH, so FG = EH = 17.
- EF = 184, which is the other side of EFGH, so EF = GH = 184.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D and C are from rectangle ABCD, and E and F are from rectangle EFGH. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

I think I need to find some relationship between these rectangles and the cyclic quadrilateral.

Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to model the problem. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then:

- Point C would be at (107,0) because CD = AB = 107. Wait, no, AB is 107, and AB is adjacent to AD. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are AB and BC. So, AB is 107, BC is 16.

Wait, let me clarify the rectangle ABCD. Let me think of it as:

- A is at (0,0)
- B is at (107,0)
- C is at (107,16)
- D is at (0,16)

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if A is at (0,0), then B would be at (107,0). Then, since BC is 16, moving up from B, so C would be at (107,16). Then, D would be at (0,16). So, that's correct.

Wait, but then D is at (0,16). Hmm. But in the problem, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, point D is at (0,16), point C is at (107,16). So, the line DC is horizontal, at y=16.

But E and F are from rectangle EFGH. So, if E and F lie on the same line as D and C, which is y=16, then E and F must also lie on y=16.

Wait, but EFGH is a rectangle. So, let's think about the rectangle EFGH
