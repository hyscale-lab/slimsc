Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, that's interesting. The problem also mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Let me start by recalling some properties of convex equilateral hexagons with opposite sides parallel. I think such hexagons are called "affine regular" or maybe "zonogons." Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric figure. That probably means that if you have a point in one side, the opposite side has a corresponding point such that the center is the midpoint.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me visualize this. If I have a hexagon ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA as sides. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, but the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, these three sides, when extended, meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon's sides.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each side is of equal length, say 's'. Let me denote this length as 's'. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF must somehow relate to the positioning and lengths of these sides.

I think this might involve similar triangles or some proportionality. Maybe the triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides, but scaled up by some factor.

Wait, let's think about the concept of similar triangles here. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a larger triangle. Given that AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, and since the hexagon is convex, these extensions will meet at certain points forming a triangle.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the distances between the opposite sides (the distance between AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA) must be equal. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, I can model it in such a way that the opposite sides are vectors that are negatives of each other.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of translation vectors. Each pair of opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, so the hexagon can be considered as formed by translating each side into the next.

But I'm not entirely sure how to model this. Maybe another approach is needed.

Let me think about the triangle formed by the extensions. Let's denote the triangle as T, with sides 200, 240, and 300. Let's call the sides of T as t1 = 200
