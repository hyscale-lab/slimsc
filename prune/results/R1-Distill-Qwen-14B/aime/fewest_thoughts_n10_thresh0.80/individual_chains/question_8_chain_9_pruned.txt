Okay, so I have this problem to solve: find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me understand the problem. We have three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, which is a fixed number. The second condition is a bit more complex: it's a sum of terms where each term is the square of one variable multiplied by another. So, for example, a²b, a²c, and so on.

I think maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me write it out again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Hmm, I notice that each term has two variables multiplied, with one squared. Maybe I can factor this expression in a clever way. Let me see if I can group terms or factor out common parts.

Looking at the first two terms: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, the next two terms: b²a + b²c = b²(a + c). And the last two terms: c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So putting it all together:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

That seems a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can use that to simplify some of these terms.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300. Then, for example, b + c = S - a = 300 - a.

Similarly, a + c = S - b = 300 - b, and a + b = S - c = 300 - c.

So substituting into the expression:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

So that's equal to 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³.

Which can be written as 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³).

So the equation is:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So maybe I can write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I need to find all triples (a, b, c) such that this equation holds, along with a + b + c = 300.

I wonder if there's a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ to a + b + c. Let's think about known identities.

I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, since a + b + c = 300, this gives:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Which simplifies to:

90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me denote P = ab + bc + ca. Then, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2P.

Similarly, maybe I can find an expression for a³ + b³ + c³. I recall that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, substituting the known values:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3abc.

300³ is 27,000,000. So:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.

Now, let's substitute a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ into the original equation.

We have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expressions:

300*(90,000 - 2P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600P.

Then, subtracting the other part: -(27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = -27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc.

So combining these:

27,000,000 - 600P -27,000,000 + 900P -3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) -3abc = 6,000,000.

So that's:

0 + 300P -3abc = 6,000,000.

So, 300P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100P - abc = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, okay, so now I have 100P - abc = 2,000,000. Let me write that as:

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I can express P in terms of a, b, c as well. Wait, P = ab + bc + ca.

So, the equation is abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can think about variables like x = a, y = b, z = c, but that might not help.

Alternatively, since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can use symmetry or assume some ordering of a, b, c. Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, the number of solutions would be the same regardless of the order, so maybe I can consider cases where a ≤ b ≤ c or something, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another idea: maybe I can set variables such that two are equal, but I don't know if that's necessarily the case. Alternatively, think about specific values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express ab + bc + ca in terms of a + b + c and abc. Wait, no, that's not straightforward.

Wait, let's think about the equation again: 100P - abc = 2,000,000. So, 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this or find a way to express this in terms of a, b, c.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of a, b, c as variables that are all around 100, since 300 divided by 3 is 100. Maybe the solution is when a, b, c are 100 each? Let's test that.

If a = b = c = 100, then:

a + b + c =
