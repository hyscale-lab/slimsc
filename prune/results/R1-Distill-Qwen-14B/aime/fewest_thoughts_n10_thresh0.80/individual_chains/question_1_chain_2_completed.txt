Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let's see.

First, all variables x, y, z are positive real numbers, which is good because logs are defined for positive numbers. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

I need to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. Let me try to solve for x, y, z first using the given equations.

I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in terms of log x, log y, log z.

Let me denote:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

Then, the equations become:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = log₂ x - log₂ y - log₂ z = a - b - c = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = log₂ y - log₂ x - log₂ z = b - a - c = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = log₂ z - log₂ x - log₂ y = c - a - b = 1/4

So now, I have a system of three equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2  ...(1)
2. -a + b - c = 1/3 ...(2)
3. -a - b + c = 1/4 ...(3)

Hmm, let's write these equations clearly:

Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2

Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let's try to add equations or manipulate them.

If I add equations (1) and (2):

(1)+(2): (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Which simplifies to: 0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6 (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 =5/6)

So, -2c =5/6 → c = -5/(12)

Wait, hold on, c is log₂ z, which is a real number, but negative. Since z is positive, log can be negative. That's okay.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's plug c into another equation. Let's take equation (1):

a - b - (-5/12) = 1/2 → a - b +5/12 =1/2

So, a - b = 1/2 -5/12 = (6/12 -5/12) =1/12 → a - b =1/12 ...(4)

Similarly, take equation (2):

- a + b - (-5/12) =1/3 → -a + b +5/12 =1/3

So, -a + b =1/3 -5/12 = (4/12 -5/12)= -1/12 → -a + b = -1/12 ...(5)

Now, equations (4) and (5):

(4): a - b =1/12

(5): -a + b = -1/12

If I add (4) and (5):

(a -a) + (-b +b) =1/12 -1/12 → 0=0. Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe I can solve for a or b.

From (4): a = b +1/12

Plugging into (5):

-(b +1/12) + b = -1/12 → -b -1/12 + b = -1/12 → -1/12 = -1/12. Well, that's an identity, so it doesn't give new info.

So perhaps I need to use equation (3). Let's recall equation (3):

- a - b + c =1/4

We know c is -5/12, so:

- a - b -5/12 =1/4 → -a -b =1/4 +5/12 = 3/12 +5/12=8/12=2/3

So, -a - b =2/3 → a + b= -2/3 ...(6)

But from equation (4): a = b +1/12. Plugging into equation (6):

(b +1/12) + b = -2/3 → 2b +1/12 = -2/3

Subtract 1/12: 2b = -2/3 -1/12 = (-8/12 -1/12)= -9/12= -3/4

So, 2b = -3/4 → b= -3/8

Then from equation (4): a = b +1/12= (-3/8) +1/12

Convert to common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24, and 1/12=2/24. So a= (-9/24 +2/24)= (-7)/24

So a = -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.

So, let me recap:

a = log₂ x = -7/24 → x=2^(-7/24)

b = log₂ y = -3/8 → y=2^(-3/8)

c = log₂ z = -5/12 → z=2^(-5/12)

Wait, but I need to compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²). Let me write that in terms of a, b, c.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) =4 log₂ x +3 log₂ y +2 log₂ z =4a +3b +2c

So plugging a, b, c:

4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24)= (-28)/24= -7/6

3*(-3/8)= (-9)/8

2*(-5/12)= (-10)/12= -5/6

So summing them: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

First, let's find a common denominator. 6,8,6. LCD is 24.

Convert each term:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8

So log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8. Therefore, its absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8.

So the value is 25/8. The problem states it is m/n where m and n are coprime. 25 and 8 are coprime since 25=5² and 8=2³, no common factors.

Thus, m=25, n=8, so m+n=33.

Wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me double-check.

First, solving the system for a,b,c:

Equation (1): a - b -c =1/2

Equation (2): -a + b -c=1/3

Equation (3): -a -b +c=1/4

I added (1)+(2) and got -2c=5/6 → c=-5/12. That seems right.

Then equation (1): a - b =1/2 +c=1/2 -5/12=1/12. So a - b=1/12.

Equation (2): -a +b=1/3 +c=1/3 -5/12= (4/12 -5/12)= -1/12. So -a +b= -1/12.

Then, adding (1) and (2) again, but that didn't help. So I set a =b +1/12.

Then I used equation (3): -a -b +c=1/4. Substitute c=-5/12:

-a -b -5/12=1/4 → -a -b=1/4 +5/12= (3/12 +5/12)=8/12=2/3. So a + b= -2/3.

Then from a =b +1/12 and a + b= -2/3:

Substitute a: (b +1/12) +b= -2/3 → 2b +1/12= -2/3 → 2b= -2/3 -1/12.

Convert to twelfths: -2/3 is -8/12. So 2b= -8/12 -1/12= -9/12= -3/4. So b= -3/8.

Then a= b +1/12= (-3/8) +1/12. Convert to 24ths: -9/24 +2/24= -7/24. Correct.

So a= -7/24, b=-3/8, c=-5/12.

Then computing 4a +3b +2c:

4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6.

3*(-3/8)= -9/8.

2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6.

Adding: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6). Let me compute in fractions.

Convert all to 24ths:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8= -27/24

-5/6= -20/24

Sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24= (-75)/24= -25/8.

So yes, the absolute value is 25/8. So m=25, n=8, m+n=33.

I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the steps.


Let \( x, y, \) and \( z \) be positive real numbers satisfying the given logarithmic equations. We start by expressing the equations in terms of logarithms:

\[
\begin{cases}
\log_2\left(\dfrac{x}{yz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{y}{xz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{z}{xy}\right) = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

Using the properties of logarithms, we rewrite each equation as:

\[
\begin{cases}
a - b - c = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
-b - a - c = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
-c - a - b = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

where \( a = \log_2 x \), \( b = \log_2 y \), and \( c = \log_2 z \). Solving this system:

1. Adding the first two equations: \(-2c = \dfrac{5}{6} \) gives \( c = -\dfrac{5}{12} \).
2. Substituting \( c \) into the first equation: \( a - b = \dfrac{1}{12} \).
3. Substituting \( c \) into the second equation: \( -a + b = -\dfrac{1}{12} \).
4. Adding these two results: \( a = b + \dfrac{1}{12} \).
5. Using the third original equation: \( -a - b = \dfrac{2}{3} \), substituting \( a \) gives \( 2b = -\dfrac{3}{4} \) so \( b = -\dfrac{3}{8} \).
6. Substituting \( b \) back gives \( a = -\dfrac{7}{24} \).

Now, compute \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\dfrac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\dfrac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\dfrac{5}{12}\right) = -\dfrac{7}{6} - \dfrac{9}{8} - \dfrac{5}{6} = -\dfrac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \( \dfrac{25}{8} \). Thus, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), leading to \( m + n = 33 \).

\(\boxed{33}\)
