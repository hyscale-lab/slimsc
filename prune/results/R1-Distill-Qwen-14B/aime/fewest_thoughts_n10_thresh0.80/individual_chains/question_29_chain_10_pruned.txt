Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize it first.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, so they form a cyclic quadrilateral. Hmm, interesting. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Rectangle ABCD: so AB is 107, BC is 16. So, sides AB and CD are 107, and sides BC and AD are 16. Similarly, rectangle EFGH: EF is 184, FG is 17, so sides EF and GH are 184, and sides FG and EH are 17.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order on the line is probably D-E-C-F or something like that. Wait, but since ABCD is a rectangle, point D is a corner, and E is a corner of EFGH. Maybe E is attached to D? Hmm, perhaps they're connected in a way that the sides DE and EF are part of the same line.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, the four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. That probably gives us some properties to work with, like cyclic quadrilateral theorems or something related to power of a point.

Let me write down what I know:

- ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16.

- EFGH is a rectangle, so EF = GH = 184, FG = EH = 17.

- D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F.

- A, D, H, G are concyclic (lie on a circle). So, ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral.

I need to find CE, the distance between points C and E on the line D-E-C-F.

Let me try to figure out the positions of these points. Since ABCD is a rectangle, let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.

Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (AB, BC) = (107, 16). Wait, no, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB is along the x-axis from A to B, BC is vertical from B to C, etc. Wait, maybe not. Let me think carefully.

Wait, no, if I place D at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, the coordinates would be:

- D: (0, 0)

- C: (a, 0), where a is the length DC, which is equal to AB, so 107.

- B: (a, b), where b is BC, which is 16.

- A: (0, b), so (0, 16).

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if D is at (0, 0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to C would be along the x-axis. So, DC = AB = 107. So, C is at (107, 0). Then, from C, moving up BC = 16, so B is at (107, 16). Then, from B, moving left AB = 107, so A is at (0, 16).

Wait, that seems correct. So, rectangle ABCD has coordinates:

- D: (0, 0)

- C: (107, 0)

- B: (107, 16)

- A: (0, 16)

Okay, now rectangle EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, line DC is the same as the line where D, E, C, F lie. Wait, DC is from (0,0) to (107, 0), which is the x-axis. So, E and F are on the x-axis.

Wait, but E is a point on rectangle EFGH. So, rectangle EFGH must be placed such that points E and F are on the x-axis, and the rectangle is either above or below the x-axis.

Since D is at (0,0), and E is next, perhaps E is to the left of D? Or to the right of C?

Wait, the line D-E-C-F: if D is at (0,0), then E would be to the left of D, or to the right of C. But since E is a corner of rectangle EFGH, which must have EF = 184 and FG = 17.

Wait, if E is to the left of D, then F would be on the line beyond E. But if E is to the right of C, then F would be beyond C.

Wait, but if E is to the right of C, then EF would be 184, which is much longer than DC, which is 107. Since EF is 184, that's possible.

Alternatively, E could be to the left of D.

But let me think. If E is to the left of D, then F would be to the right of E, but since D, E, C, F are collinear, and C is at (107, 0), if E is to the left of D, then F would be somewhere between D and C or beyond C.

But in either case, the rectangle EFGH must have sides EF=184 and FG=17.

Wait, but if the line is the x-axis, then EFGH must be a rectangle with sides along the x-axis and vertical lines. So, if E is at (x, 0), then F would be at (x + 184, 0), assuming EF is along the x-axis.

But rectangle EFGH has FG = 17, so from F, moving up or down 17 units to get to G and H.

Wait, but the other rectangle ABCD has points A, D, H, G on a circle. So, A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), and H and G are points of EFGH.

Hmmm.

Wait, so rectangle EFGH: E is on the x-axis, F is 184 units to the right or left. Let me assume E is to the left of D, so E is at (-k, 0) for some k. Then F would be at (-k + 184, 0). Since D is at (0,0), C is at (107, 0), F could be somewhere beyond C if E is to the left.

Wait, but then if E is at (-k, 0), F would be at (-k + 184, 0). The position of F depends on where E is.

But the line passes through D, E, C, F, so E is between D and F or F is beyond C.

Wait, perhaps E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of D. So, order is E, D, C, F on the x-axis.

But then, the distance from E to D is some length, D to C is 107, and C to F is some other length.

Wait, but in that case, E is at (e, 0), and F is at (e + 184, 0). Since D is at (0,0), E must be at (e, 0), and F at (e + 184, 0). But D is on the line between E and F, so E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of D.

So, E is at (e, 0), with e < 0, and F is at (e + 184, 0). Since D is at (0,0), which is between E and F, then we have e < 0 and e + 184 > 0.

So, E is at (e, 0), F is at (e + 184, 0). Now, since C is at (107, 0), which is between D (0,0) and F. So, we need e + 184 > 107.

So, e must satisfy: e < 0, and e + 184 > 107 â‡’ e > -77.

So, e is between -77 and 0.

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively,
