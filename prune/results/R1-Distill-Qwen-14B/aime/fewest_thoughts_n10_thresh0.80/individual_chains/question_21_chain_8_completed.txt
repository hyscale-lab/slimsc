Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to wrap my head around it.

Alright, the problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. They even gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6+3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

So, I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. That means for this minimal b, there are at least 11 numbers n that satisfy the two conditions.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, let's break down what it means for n to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. So, a is at least 1 and at most b-1. Similarly, c can be from 0 to b-1.

So, n = a*b + c. The digits are a and c, and their sum is a + c. The problem says that a + c = sqrt(n). So, putting it together: a + c = sqrt(a*b + c).

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of a, c, and b. I need to find all triples (a, c, b) where a is between 1 and b-1, c is between 0 and b-1, and a + c equals the square root of (a*b + c).

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimal b where there are more than ten such n's. So, for each b, I need to count how many n's satisfy the condition, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express the condition mathematically and then find a relationship between a, c, and b.

Given that a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). Let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c.

Let me rearrange this equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe group terms in terms of a and c.

Let me try to collect like terms:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in a. So, for given b and c, we can solve for a.

But wait, a has to be a positive integer between 1 and b-1, and c has to be between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, for each b, I can iterate through possible a and c values and check if the equation holds. But since b can be potentially large, this might not be efficient. I need a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe express this in terms of c:

From the equation a + c = sqrt(a*b + c), square both sides:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c.

Let me rearrange this:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0.

So, this is a quadratic in a. For each b and c, maybe we can find a.

But since a must be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square.

The quadratic in a is: a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0.

The discriminant D is:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c^2 - c)

= 4c^2 -4b c + b^2 -4c^2 +4c

= (-4b c) + b^2 +4c

= b^2 -4b c +4c.

Hmm, this discriminant must be a perfect square for a to be integer.

Let me factor this:

b^2 -4b c +4c = b^2 -4c(b -1).

Hmm, that might not help much.

Alternatively, write D = b^2 -4c(b -1) = (b - 2c)^2 - (4c^2) + 4c(b -1)

Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps D = (2c - b)^2 -4*(c^2 -c) = 4c^2 -4b c + b² -4c² +4c = b² -4b c +4c.

So, discriminant D = b² -4c(b -1).

Wait, so D must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = k^2, where k is an integer.

So, b² -4c(b -1) = k².

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that approach is the easiest. Maybe I can approach the problem differently.

Let me consider that n = a*b + c, and a + c = sqrt(n) = m, where m is an integer because n is a perfect square (since a + c is integer).

So, m = a + c, and n = m².

So, m² = a*b + c.

But since a and c are digits in base b, a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is at least 0 and at most b-1.

So, let's express c as m - a. Because m = a + c => c = m - a.

Substituting into n = a*b + c:

m² = a*b + (m - a)

Simplify:

m² = a*b + m - a

Bring all terms to one side:

m² - m = a*(b -1)

So, a = (m² - m)/(b -1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (m² - m) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result of the division must be an integer a in [1, b-1].

Moreover, c = m - a must be between 0 and b-1, so:

0 ≤ m - a ≤ b -1

Since a is positive, m must be at least a + 0, which is a, but m is also a + c, and c can be up to b-1. So, m can be as large as a + (b-1). But since a is at least 1, m is at least 1, and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b -2. So m ranges from 1 to 2b -2.

But since m² = n = a*b + c, which is at least a*1 + 0 = a ≥1, and at most (b-1)*b + (b-1) = (b-1)(b +1) = b² -1. So, m² ≤ b² -1 => m ≤ sqrt(b² -1) < b. So, m is actually less than b.

Wait, that's an important point. Because m² = a*b + c ≤ (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² -1. So, m is less than b. Therefore, m ranges from 1 to b-1.

So, m is in [1, b-1], and a is in [1, b-1]. Also, c = m - a must be ≥0 and ≤ b-1.

So, c = m - a ≥ 0 => a ≤ m.

And c = m -a ≤ b -1 => a ≥ m - (b -1).

But since a ≥1, we have a must be ≥ max(1, m - (b -1)).

So, for each m from 1 to b-1, we can compute a as (m² - m)/(b -1), and check if a is integer, and if a is in [1, m], because a must be ≤ m since c = m -a ≥0, and also a must be ≥1.

Wait, let me step back.

We have a = (m² - m)/(b -1). For a to be integer, (b -1) must divide (m² - m). So, (b -1) | m(m -1).

So, b -1 must be a divisor of m(m -1). Since m and m-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, the factors of m(m-1) are the products of factors of m and factors of m-1.

So, for each m, (b -1) can be any divisor of m(m-1). But since b must be ≥2, b -1 ≥1.

But for each b, we can have multiple m's such that (b -1) divides m(m -1). So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of m's in [1, b-1] such that (b-1) divides m(m-1). And for each such m, a = (m² - m)/(b -1) must be an integer between 1 and m.

Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, no. Because for each m, (b-1) must divide m(m-1), so (b-1) is a divisor of m(m-1). But since m can vary, for each b, we can count how many m's in [1, b-1] satisfy (b-1) divides m(m-1).

But let's think about what (b-1) divides m(m-1) implies.

Since m and m -1 are coprime, their product is m(m -1). So, (b -1) must divide m(m -1). Because m and m -1 are coprime, (b -1) must be a product of a divisor of m and a divisor of m -1.

But maybe it's better to think in terms of factors. For each m in [1, b-1], check if (b-1) divides m(m -1). If yes, then a is (m² - m)/(b -1), which must be an integer between 1 and m.

Wait, but for each b, the number of such m's is the number of b-eautiful numbers. So, our goal is to find the minimal b such that the count of m's in [1, b-1] where (b-1) divides m(m-1) is greater than 10.

Hmm, this seems promising. Because if I can find for each b, the number of such m's, then I can find when that count exceeds ten.

So, the problem reduces to: find the smallest integer b ≥2 such that the number of integers m in [1, b-1] with (b -1) divides m(m -1) is greater than 10.

Wait, but let me think again. Because for each m, (b-1) must divide m(m -1). So, for each b, the number of such m is equal to the number of m's in [1, b-1] where m(m-1) is a multiple of (b-1). So, this is equivalent to m(m-1) ≡0 mod (b-1).

Which is equivalent to m ≡0 mod (b-1) or m ≡1 mod (b-1). Because m(m-1) is zero mod (b-1) if either m ≡0 or m ≡1 mod (b-1).

So, for m in [1, b-1], the solutions to m(m-1) ≡0 mod (b-1) are m ≡0 or 1 mod (b-1). But since m is between 1 and b-1, the only possible m's that satisfy this are m=1 and m=b-1.

Wait, that can't be. Because, for example, take b=13 as in the example. Then b-1=12. So, m must be 1 or 12 in [1,12]. But in the example, m was 6+3=9. So, 9 is neither 1 nor 12. Hmm, so my previous reasoning must be flawed.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that m(m-1) ≡0 mod (b-1) implies m≡0 or 1 mod (b-1). But that's only true if (b-1) is prime, right? Because if (b-1) is composite, m(m-1) can be 0 mod (b-1) even if m isn't 0 or 1 mod (b-1), as long as m is congruent to a factor of (b-1) or m-1 is congruent to a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider that (b-1) divides m(m-1). So, the equation is m(m-1) = k*(b -1), where k is an integer. So, for each m in [1, b-1], m(m-1) must be a multiple of (b-1). Thus, k must be such that k = m(m-1)/(b-1) is integer.

But for each b, the number of m's where (b-1) divides m(m-1) is the number of divisors of (b-1) in the range [1, b-1], but that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that (b-1) divides m(m-1). So, m(m-1) ≡0 mod (b-1). This can be written as m ≡0 mod d or m ≡1 mod d, where d is a divisor of (b-1). Wait, no, perhaps not exactly.

Alternatively, think about the factors of (b-1). Let me denote (b-1) as D. So, D = b-1. Then, for m(m-1) to be divisible by D, the product m(m-1) must have all the prime factors of D. Since m and m-1 are coprime, each prime factor of D must divide either m or m-1.

So, for each prime power in the factorization of D, that prime must divide either m or m-1. So, the number of solutions m in [1, D] is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of D. Because for each prime, you can choose whether it divides m or m-1.

Wait, but m is in [1, D], so m can be 1 or D, but in this case, m is from 1 to D, so 1 ≤ m ≤ D.

Wait, let's test with the example where D=12 (b=13). The number of solutions m should be 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of 12. 12 factors into 2^2 *3^1, so k=2. So, number of solutions is 2^2=4.

In the example, m was 9, which is one of the solutions. Let's see what the four solutions are.

Wait, but m can be 1, 3, 4, 9, 12? Wait, no, for D=12, the possible m's where m(m-1) is divisible by 12 are m=1, m=4, m=9, m=13. But wait, m has to be ≤ D=12, so m=13 is excluded. So, the solutions are m=1,4,9,12.

Wait, let me check:

- m=1: 1*0=0, which is divisible by 12.
- m=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 12.
- m=9:9*8=72, which is 6*12, divisible by 12.
- m=12:12*11=132, which is 11*12, divisible by 12.

So yes, four solutions. So, for D=12, we have 4 m's, which corresponds to 4 b-eautiful numbers for b=13.

But in the problem statement, 81 is 13-eautiful, which corresponds to m=9. So, the other three m's would correspond to a= (1² -1)/12=0, which is invalid since a must be ≥1; a=(4² -4)/12= (16-4)/12=12/12=1; a=(9² -9)/12=(81-9)/12=72/12=6; a=(12² -12)/12=(144-12)/12=132/12=11.

So, for m=1: a=0 invalid.

m=4: a=1. Then c=4-1=3. So, n= a*b + c = 1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4, which is correct.

m=9: a=6, c=3. n=6*13 +3=81. sqrt(81)=9. Correct.

m=12: a=11, c=1. n=11*13 +1=143 +1=144. sqrt(144)=12.

So, for b=13, we have three valid b-eautiful numbers: 16,81,144. Wait, but earlier I thought there were four m's, but only three of them give a valid a (since m=1 gives a=0, which is invalid). So, for b=13, there are three b-eautiful numbers.

Hmm, that's different from my initial thought. So, the number of m's where (b-1) divides m(m-1) is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of (b-1)=D. But some of these m's may lead to a=0, which is invalid, so we need to subtract those cases.

So, in the example, with D=12=2^2*3^1, k=2, so 4 m's, but one leads to a=0, so three valid numbers.

So, the general approach is:

1. For each b, compute D = b-1.

2. Find the number of distinct prime factors of D, say k.

3. The number of m's is 2^k, but some may lead to a=0, which are invalid.

4. So, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 2^k minus the number of m's where a=0.

Wait, but when does a=0? When (m² - m)/D =0, which implies m² -m=0. So, m(m -1)=0. So, m=0 or m=1. But m is in [1, D], so m=1.

So, when m=1, a=(1² -1)/D=0. So, only m=1 gives a=0, which is invalid.

Therefore, the number of valid b-eautiful numbers is (number of m's where m(m -1) divisible by D) minus 1 (for m=1).

But wait, in the example, D=12, which had 4 m's (1,4,9,12). For each, a was computed as:

- m=1: a=0 invalid

- m=4: a=1

- m=9: a=6

- m=12: a=11

So, 3 valid numbers. So, 4 m's, subtract 1 invalid, gives 3.

So, if the number of m's is 2^k, then the number of valid numbers is 2^k -1.

Wait, but wait. For D=12, k=2, 2^2=4. 4-1=3, which matches.

Another example: Let's take D=6, which factors into 2*3, so k=2. So, 2^2=4 m's. What are they?

m=1: 1*0=0, divisible by 6.

m=2: 2*1=2, not divisible by 6.

m=3:3*2=6, divisible by 6.

m=4:4*3=12, divisible by 6.

m=5:5*4=20, not divisible by 6.

m=6:6*5=30, divisible by 6.

So, m's are 1,3,4,6. So, four m's. Then a for each m:

m=1: a=0 invalid.

m=3: a=(9-3)/6=6/6=1

m=4: a=(16-4)/6=12/6=2

m=6: a=(36 -6)/6=30/6=5

So, three valid numbers: m=3,4,6, leading to a=1,2,5. So, three numbers. So, 4 m's, minus 1 invalid, gives 3.

So, the formula holds.

Wait, but in this case, k=2, so 2^2=4, minus 1=3. So, it's consistent.

Another test case: D=4, which factors into 2^2, so k=1.

Number of m's is 2^1=2. The m's are 1 and 4 (since m(m-1) must be divisible by 4). Let's check:

m=1: 0, which is divisible.

m=2: 2*1=2, not divisible by 4.

m=3:3*2=6, not divisible by 4.

m=4:4*3=12, which is divisible by 4.

So, m=1 and 4. So, 2 m's.

Compute a for each:

m=1: a=0 invalid.

m=4: a=(16 -4)/4=12/4=3. So, a=3. Then c=4-3=1.

So, n=3*5 +1=16. sqrt(16)=4, correct.

So, only one valid number. So, 2 m's minus 1 invalid gives 1.

So, the formula holds.

Wait, but for D=4, 2^1=2, minus 1=1.

So, seems the pattern is that for D, the number of valid m's is 2^{k} -1, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of D.

Wait, but in the case where D is a prime power, say D=p^e, then k=1, so number of valid m's is 2^1 -1=1. But let's check.

Take D=8=2^3. k=1.

So, the number of m's where m(m-1) is divisible by 8.

m must be such that either m ≡0 mod 8 or m ≡1 mod 8.

In [1,8], m=1,8.

Compute a:

m=1: a=0 invalid.

m=8: a=(64 -8)/8=56/8=7. Then c=8 -7=1.

So, n=7*9 +1=63 +1=64. sqrt(64)=8. Correct.

So, only one valid number.

Thus, formula holds: 2^1 -1=1.

Another example: D=9=3^2, k=1. So, 2^1 -1=1.

m's where m(m-1) divisible by 9 are m=1 and m=9.

a for m=1: 0 invalid.

m=9: a=(81 -9)/9=72/9=8.

c=9 -8=1.

n=8*10 +1=81. sqrt(81)=9. Correct.

So, only one valid number. So, formula holds.

So, in general, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 2^{k} -1, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of D = b-1.

Wait, but wait: When D is 1, which would be b=2, D=1. Then, number of m's? Let's see.

b=2, D=1. Then m can be 1. So, m=1.

a=(1-1)/1=0 invalid. So, no valid numbers. So, 0 b-eautiful numbers.

But according to the formula, k=0 (since D=1 has no prime factors), so 2^0=1, minus 1=0. Which matches.

Another test: D=2, which is prime. k=1.

So, 2^1 -1=1. So, one valid number.

Check:

b=3, D=2.

m's where m(m-1) divisible by 2.

In [1,2], m=1: 0, which is divisible.

m=2:2*1=2, divisible.

So, m=1 and 2.

a for m=1:0 invalid.

m=2: a=(4 -2)/2=2/2=1.

c=2 -1=1.

n=1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2. Correct.

So, one valid number. So, formula holds.

So, if I can accept that for each D=b-1, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 2^{k} -1, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of D, then I can proceed.

So, my goal is to find the smallest b >=2 such that 2^{k} -1 >10.

So, 2^{k} -1 >10 => 2^{k} >11 => 2^{k} >=12.

So, 2^{k} >=12.

Find k such that 2^{k} >=12.

Compute:

k=4: 2^4=16 >=12.

k=3:8 <12.

So, k must be at least 4.

Therefore, the minimal b is such that D=b-1 has at least four distinct prime factors.

Because for k=4, 2^4 -1=15>10.

Wait, but wait: The number of b-eautiful numbers is 2^{k} -1, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of D=b-1.

So, to have 2^k -1 >10, we need 2^k >11, so k>=4, because 2^4=16>11, while 2^3=8<11.

Therefore, the minimal D must have at least four distinct prime factors.

So, the minimal D is the product of the first four primes: 2*3*5*7=210.

Thus, D=210, so b=D+1=211.

Wait, but wait: Let's check if D=210 is indeed the minimal D with four distinct prime factors.

Yes, because the next possible D with four distinct primes would be 2*3*5*7=210, then 2*3*5*11=330, etc.

So, the minimal D is 210, leading to b=211.

But wait, is this correct?

Wait, let's think. When D has four distinct prime factors, k=4, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 15, which is more than ten. So, b=211 would be the minimal b where there are 15 b-eautiful numbers.

But before jumping to this conclusion, let me verify if perhaps a smaller D with k=4 exists, or if D with four distinct prime factors is indeed 210.

Wait, 2*3*5*7=210 is the minimal number with four distinct primes. So, yes, D=210 is minimal.

But wait, perhaps there's a smaller D which is not square-free but has four prime factors with multiplicity? Wait, no, because k is the number of distinct prime factors.

Wait, in our formula, k is the number of distinct prime factors of D. So, if D has, say, a prime factor raised to a higher power but with the same number of distinct primes, it won't increase k.

So, to have k=4, D must have four distinct primes. So, the smallest such D is 210.

Hence, the minimal b is 210 +1=211.

But before finalizing this answer, let me test it.

So, for b=211, D=210. The number of b-eautiful numbers is 2^4 -1=15>10.

Is 211 indeed the minimal b? Let's see if perhaps a smaller D with k=4 exists. But as I thought, 210 is the smallest D with four distinct primes.

But wait, is there a D smaller than 210 that's not square-free but has four distinct prime factors? No, because 210 is the product of the first four primes, so any other D with four distinct primes would be larger or equal.

Wait, no, 2*3*5*7=210, which is the minimal D with four distinct primes. So, yes, 210 is the minimal D. So, the minimal b is 211.

Wait, but let's check for b=211, whether the number of b-eautiful numbers is indeed 15.

Each m corresponds to a solution where m(m-1) is divisible by 210. So, m must satisfy m ≡0 or 1 mod each prime factor. Since 210=2*3*5*7, the number of solutions is 2^4=16. But we subtract 1 for the case m=1, which gives a=0. So, 15 solutions.

So, yes, 15 b-eautiful numbers for b=211.

But wait, is there a smaller b where D has four distinct prime factors?

Wait, let me think. For example, D=105=3*5*7. It has three distinct primes, so k=3, which gives 7 b-eautiful numbers. Not enough.

D=165=3*5*11. Still three primes.

D=210 is the first with four primes.

Wait, another thought: What if D has a higher power but same number of primes? For example, D=2^4=16, which has k=1. Then, number of b-eautiful numbers is 1. Not enough.

Similarly, D=2^2*3=12, which has k=2, number of b-eautiful numbers=3.

So, no, the only way to get k=4 is to have four distinct primes.

Therefore, the minimal b is 211.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \), and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding \( b \)-eautiful Numbers**:
   - A two-digit number in base \( b \) is of the form \( n = a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) (i.e., \( 1 \leq a \leq b-1 \) and \( 0 \leq c \leq b-1 \)).
   - The sum of the digits \( a + c \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \).

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - Let \( m = a + c \). Then \( m = \sqrt{n} \), so \( n = m^2 \).
   - Substituting \( n = a \cdot b + c \) and \( c = m - a \), we get:
     \[
     m^2 = a \cdot b + (m - a)
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     m^2 - m = a \cdot (b - 1)
     \]
     Thus, \( a = \frac{m^2 - m}{b - 1} \) must be an integer.

3. **Conditions for \( a \)**:
   - \( a \) must be an integer between 1 and \( b - 1 \).
   - This implies \( b - 1 \) must divide \( m(m - 1) \).

4. **Number of Solutions**:
   - For each \( b \), let \( D = b - 1 \). The number of valid \( m \) values is determined by the number of distinct prime factors of \( D \).
   - If \( D \) has \( k \) distinct prime factors, the number of valid \( m \) values is \( 2^k - 1 \) (subtracting the case where \( m = 1 \), which leads to \( a = 0 \)).

5. **Finding the Minimal \( b \)**:
   - We need \( 2^k - 1 > 10 \), which simplifies to \( 2^k > 11 \). The smallest \( k \) satisfying this is \( k = 4 \).
   - The smallest \( D \) with 4 distinct prime factors is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 210 \).
   - Therefore, the smallest \( b \) is \( D + 1 = 211 \).

### Conclusion:
The least integer \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is \( \boxed{211} \).
