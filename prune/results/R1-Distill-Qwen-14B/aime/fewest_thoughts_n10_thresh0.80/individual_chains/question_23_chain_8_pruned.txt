Okay, so I've got this problem here about points on a hyperbola forming a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step.

First, the hyperbola equation is given as (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The a² is 20, so a is sqrt(20), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5). The b² is 24, so b is sqrt(24) or 2*sqrt(6).

Now, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at any angle, not necessarily right angles, unless it's a square. But in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect the vertex angles.

But in this problem, it says the diagonals intersect at the origin. So the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin, so if the rhombus is centered at the origin, the diagonals would cross there.

So the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, meaning that the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, actually wait, no: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, sorry, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square? No, that's not right. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me get this straight.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, yes, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's correct. So they intersect at 90 degrees and bisect each other. So that must mean that in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each diagonal passes through the origin, and they are perpendicular.

So, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular to each other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can represent the points as follows: suppose that point A is (x,
