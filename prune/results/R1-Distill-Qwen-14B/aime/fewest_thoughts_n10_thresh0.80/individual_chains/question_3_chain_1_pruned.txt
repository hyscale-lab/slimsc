Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), but in this case, if A is winning the grand prize, then A is a subset of winning a prize, right? Because if she wins the grand prize, she definitely wins a prize. So, A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A), which is the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Then, divide them to get the conditional probability.

First, let's compute P(A). Winning the grand prize means all four of her numbers are chosen. Since she picks 4 distinct numbers, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers, the number of ways this can happen is just 1. Specifically, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (the exact set she picked). The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is C(10,4). So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, let me check: C(10,4) is 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, onto P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, how do we calculate this?

Well, in probability, sometimes it's easier to compute the complement and subtract from 1. The complement of winning a prize is winning nothing or winning exactly one number.

So, P(B) = 1 - [P(winning 0 numbers) + P(winning exactly 1 number)].

Let me compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210, as before.

P(winning 0 numbers): This means none of her 4 numbers are chosen. So, all 4 lottery numbers are chosen from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4) = 15. So, the probability is 15 / 210.

P(winning exactly 1 number): This means exactly one of her numbers is chosen, and the other three are from the remaining 6. The number of ways to choose 1 number from her 4 is C(4,1) = 4. The number of ways to choose the remaining 3 numbers from the 6 non-picked numbers is C(6,3) = 20. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, the probability is 80 / 210.

So, putting it together:

P(B) = 1 - [15/210 + 80/210] = 1 - [95/210] = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Simplify that: 115 and 210 can both be divided by 5. 115 ÷ 5 = 23, 210 ÷5 = 42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, let me double-check these calculations because that seems a bit high. Is 115 correct? Let's see: 15 (for 0 matches) + 80 (for 1 match) = 95. So, 210 - 95 = 115, yes. So, that's 115/210. Simplify: 23/42. Okay, that's right.

So now, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42. So, P(A|B) is (1/210) / (23/42).

Dividing fractions: multiply by reciprocal, so (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210 * 23). Simplify 42/210: both are divisible by 42. 42 ÷42=1, 210 ÷42=5. So, it becomes 1/(5 * 23) = 1/115.

Wait, that doesn't make immediate sense. Let me compute it numerically:

(1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). 42 and 210 have a common factor: 42 is 6*7, 210 is 42*5. So, 42/210 is 1/5. So, (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m is 1 and n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, because 115 is 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with them.

So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because 1/115 seems a bit low. Let me go through the steps once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, P(A) is correct: only one possible winning combination, so 1/C(10,4)=1/210.

For P(B), which is the probability of at least two matches. So, we can compute it as 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match). 

P(0 matches): C(6,4)/C(10,4) = 15/210.

P(1 match): C(4,1)*C(6,3)/C(10,4) = 4 * 20 = 80, so 80/210.

So, 15 + 80 = 95. 210 - 95 = 115. So, 115/210 is correct, which simplifies to 23/42.

Then, P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Yes, that seems correct. So, 1/115 is the probability, so m + n is 116.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize divided by the number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize.

Number of favorable for grand prize: 1.

Number of favorable for winning a prize: total number of ways where at least two numbers match.

So, how many combinations have at least two matches? That's C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Wait, that's another way to compute the number of favorable outcomes for B.

Yes, let's compute that:

At least two matches: can be 2, 3, or 4 matches.

Number of ways for exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). Because choose 2 from Jen's 4, and 2 from the remaining 6.

Similarly, for exactly 3
