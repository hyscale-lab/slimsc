Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω isn't equal to 1. Hmm, that seems pretty involved, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, let's recall that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. That means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the expression we're dealing with is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let's denote this product as P. So,

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, I need to compute this product. Since it's a product over all 13th roots of unity, maybe there's a clever way to express this product using properties of cyclotomic polynomials or something similar.

Let me consider evaluating this product as a value of a polynomial evaluated at a certain point. For instance, I know that products over roots of unity can sometimes be linked to the values of polynomials at specific points. 

Looking at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me rewrite this as a quadratic in ω^k. Let's let z = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2z + z², which is z² - 2z + 2. So, each term is a quadratic in ω^k.

Therefore, the entire product becomes the product over all z = ω^k (including k=0, which gives z=1) of (z² - 2z + 2). So,

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

But since ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the 13th roots of unity, this product is essentially evaluating the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for each 13th root of unity z.

Wait a second, the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of unity can sometimes be connected to cyclotomic polynomials. Specifically, if we have a polynomial f(z), the product over all roots of unity of f(z) is equal to the resultant of f(z) and the cyclotomic polynomial, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the product as f(z) over all z being the roots of Φ₁₃(x).

Wait, but in this case, z are all 13th roots of unity, which includes both primitive and non-primitive roots. But since ω is primitive, and we're taking k from 0 to 12, we're indeed covering all 13th roots. However, the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots, so it's (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1.

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Let me think differently.

The product we have is ∏_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2). So, that's the product over all z where z is a 13th root of unity of (z² - 2z + 2).

Wait, that seems like evaluating the product f(z) where f(z) = z² - 2z + 2, for each z^13=1. There's a formula for such products. Specifically, ∏_{z^n=1} f(z) = Res(f, x^n -1), the resultant of f and x^n -1, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, I remember that the product of f(z) over all n-th roots of unity is equal to the product of f(ζ_{n}^k) for k=0,...,n-1, where ζ_n is a primitive n-th root.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that the product ∏_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2) is equal to the resultant of f(z) = z² - 2z + 2 and z¹³ - 1. Alternatively, it can be connected to evaluating f(z) at all roots of z¹³ - 1 = 0.

Wait, another thought: if f(z) is a polynomial, then the product of f(z) over all roots z of another polynomial g(z) is equal to the resultant of f and g. But I'm not exactly sure how that works.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use complex conjugates or other properties. Let me consider that each term in the product is (z² - 2z + 2) = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), since the roots of z² - 2z + 2 = 0 are 1 ± i.

Yes, that's right: solving z² - 2z + 2 = 0 gives z = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i.

So, each term factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the entire product P becomes:

P = ∏_{z^13=1} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) = ∏_{z^13=1} (z - (1 + i)) * ∏_{z^13=1} (z - (1 - i)).

But wait, each of these products is the product of (z - a) over all z^13=1, which is simply the evaluation of the polynomial z¹³ - 1 at z = a, right? Because the product of (z - a) for all z being the roots of z^13 = 1 is equal to z^13 - 1 evaluated at z = a.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: If I have a polynomial f(z) = z^n - 1, which has roots at all n-th roots of unity. Then, the product of (z - a) for each root z is f(a). Hmm, no, actually, the product over (z - root) is f(z), but if I evaluate f(a), it's the product over (a - root). So, f(a) = product_{roots} (a - root).

Wait, yes, that's correct. So, more precisely, for f(z) = z^13 - 1, the product over all roots z of (a - z) is equal to f(a). Therefore, the product over all roots z of (z - a) is equal to (-1)^13 * f(a) = -f(a), because each term is (z - a) = -(a - z).

So, for our case, ∏_{z^13=1} (z - a) = (-1)^13 * (a^13 - 1) = - (a^13 - 1).

Thus, each product ∏_{z^13=1} (z - (1 ± i)) = - ((1 ± i)^13 - 1).

Therefore, going back to our expression for P:

P = [ - ((1 + i)^13 - 1) ] * [ - ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ].

Simplify this:

P = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

So, P = [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].

Now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

First, let's compute (1 + i)^13. Let me recall that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Similarly, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n π/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i 13 π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i 13 π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Next, let's compute the exponentials:

e^{i 13 π/4} and e^{-i 13 π/4}.

Simplify 13 π/4: since 13 divided by 4 is 3*4 +1, so 13 π/4 = 3π + π/4. But 3π is more than 2π, so subtract 2π to get it within [0, 2π):

13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

So, e^{i 13 π/4} = e^{i 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).

Similarly, e^{-i 13 π/4} = e^{-i 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) ].

Let me compute that:

64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2
