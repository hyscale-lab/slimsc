Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 give Bob a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, right, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, first, let's try to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The losing positions are the ones where the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, meaning whatever they do, the opponent can respond in a way to win.

The base case is when there are 0 tokens left. But wait, the game ends when the last token is taken, so if it's your turn and there are 0 tokens, you can't make a move, so you lose. So, n=0 is a losing position.

But in our problem, the game starts at n≥1, so the player who takes the last token wins. Therefore, n=0 is a losing position, and n=1,2,3,4 are positions where the current player can take all tokens and win. So n=1,2,3,4 are all winning positions.

Wait, but let me clarify: if n=1, you take 1 and win. If n=2, same thing. So any n from 1 to 4, the current player can take all tokens and win. So n=1,2,3,4 are all W.

What about n=5? Let's see. The player can take 1 or 4 tokens. If they take 1, leaving 4, then the next player can take all 4 and win. If they take 4, leaving 1, then the next player takes 1 and wins. So regardless of what the current player does at n=5, the next player can win. Therefore, n=5 is an L position.

So n=5 is losing. Let's make a table to track:

n | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...
W/L| L W W W W L ? ? ? ? ?...

Now, n=6. The current player can take 1 or 4. Let's see the options:

- Take 1: leaves 5. We just saw that 5 is L, which means the next player will lose. So if the current player leaves the opponent at L, then current player can win. Therefore, n=6 is W.

Wait, because if you take 1, leaving n=5 (L), which means the opponent can't force a win from there. So the current player can force a win by taking 1. So n=6 is W
