Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each of the faces. The answer needs to be in the form m√n/p, and then I have to find m + n + p. 

First, I should probably visualize the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and an incenter is a point equidistant from all four faces. That distance is what I'm looking for, often called the inradius. 

The given edge lengths are AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. Hmm, I notice that the edges are paired: each pair has two edges of the same length. That suggests that the tetrahedron might have some symmetry. Maybe it's a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure about the exact term. But this symmetry might help simplify the problem.

Since all the opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is called a "equifacial" tetrahedron, or maybe a "disphenoid." I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, yes, that's probably the case here. Disphenoids have some nice properties, like all faces being congruent triangles, but wait, in this case, are the faces congruent? Let me check.

Wait, the edges are AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. So each pair of opposite edges is equal, but does that mean all four faces are congruent? Let's see. Each face is a triangle with sides from each pair. For example, face ABC has edges AB=√41, BC=√89, and AC=√80. Similarly, face ABD has AB=√41, BD=√80, and AD=√89. So each face has the same set of side lengths. So yes, all four faces are congruent triangles. So that means the tetrahedron is a regular-faced tetrahedron, but not necessarily regular since the edges themselves aren't all equal.

So now, since all the faces are congruent, that might mean that the inradius can be found by some formula related to the volume and the surface area. I remember that for any polyhedron, the volume can be expressed as (1/3) times the surface area times the inradius. Wait, no, actually, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area.

So, if I can find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, then I can compute r = 3V / S.

So, let's plan the steps:

1. Find the volume V of the tetrahedron.
2. Find the total surface area S.
3. Compute r = 3V / S.

First, I need to find V. Since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, I remember there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid. The volume V can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c²) )) / (6√2)

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some formulas. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use coordinates to compute the volume. Let's try that.

Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, I can place it in a coordinate system such that the coordinates are symmetric. I think placing the points as follows might work:

Let’s assign coordinates such that:

- Point A is at (x, y, z)
- Point B is at (-x, -y, z)
- Point C is at (-x, y, -z)
- Point D is at (x, -y, -z)

This is a common way to assign coordinates to a disphenoid to exploit symmetry. Let me check if this works. Let's compute the distances:

Compute AB: distance between A and B.

A is (x, y, z), B is (-x, -y, z).

AB² = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2 = 4x² + 4y².

Given AB = √41, so AB² = 41.

Similarly, compute AC: distance between A and C.

A is (x, y, z), C is (-x, y, -z).

AC² = (2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2 = 4x² + 4z².

Given AC = √80, so AC² = 80.

Similarly, compute AD: distance between A and D.

A is (x, y, z), D is (x, -y, -z).

AD² = 0^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y² + 4z².

Given AD = √89, so AD² = 89.

So now, we have three equations:

1. 4x² + 4y² = 41
2. 4x² + 4z² = 80
3. 4y² + 4z² = 89

Let me write these equations as:

Equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4.

Equation 2: x² + z² = 80/4 = 20.

Equation 3: y² + z² = 89/4.

So now, I have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41/4
2. x² + z² = 20
3. y² + z² = 89/4

I can solve these equations for x², y², z².

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(Equation 2) - (Equation 1) = (x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = z² - y² = 20 - 41/4 = (80 - 41)/4 = 39/4.

So z² - y² = 39/4.

From Equation 3, we have y² + z² = 89/4.

So now, we have two equations:

4. z² - y² = 39/4
5. z² + y² = 89/4

Adding equations 4 and 5:

2z² = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32.

So z² = 16 → z = 4 or z = -4, but since it's a coordinate, we can take z=4.

Then, from equation 5: z² + y² = 89/4.

z² = 16, so y² = 89/4 - 16 = 89/4 - 64/4 = 25/4 → y = 5/2 or y = -5/2.

Similarly, from equation 2: x² + z² = 20 → x² = 20 - 16 = 4 → x = 2 or x = -2.

So now, x = ±2, y = ±5/2, z=±4.

So the coordinates of the points are:

A = (2, 5/2, 4)

B = (-2, -5/2, 4)

C = (-2, 5/2, -4)

D = (2, -5/2, -4)

Wait, let me confirm the coordinates:
