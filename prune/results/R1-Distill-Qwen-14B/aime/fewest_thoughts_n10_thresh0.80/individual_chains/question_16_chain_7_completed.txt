Okay, I'm trying to solve this math problem. So, the problem is asking for the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, let me break this down. I think I should first find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I have that p, I can find the smallest m that satisfies the condition.

I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue modulo p are important here. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod p². So, I need primes p where -1 is a fourth power residue mod p².

Wait, but maybe I should start by checking small primes and see if any of them satisfy the condition.

Let me list the small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4.

n can be 1: 1⁴ +1 = 2, which is not divisible by 4.
n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4.
n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4.
n=4: 256 +1=257, which is 1 mod 4.
Wait, maybe n=0? 0⁴ +1=1, which is 1 mod 4. So, no n with n⁴ +1 divisible by 4. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. Let's check if there's an n with n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 9.

Compute n⁴ for n=1: 1, so 1+1=2 mod9≠0.
n=2: 16 mod9=7, 7+1=8≠0.
n=3: 0 mod9, 0+1=1≠0.
n=4: 256 mod9. Let me compute 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4+1=5≠0.
n=5: 625 mod9. 625-69*9=625-621=4, so same as n=4: 4+1=5≠0.
n=6: 1296 mod9=0, 0+1=1≠0.
n=7: 7⁴=49²=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod9. 7+1=8≠0.
n=8: 4096 mod9. 4+0+9+6=19→1+9=10→1 mod9. So 1+1=2≠0.
n=9: 6561 mod9=0, same as 0+1=1≠0.
So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next prime, p=5. Let's see if n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

Alternatively, maybe it's faster to compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 12 (since mod25 is periodic every 25 numbers, but for residues, 1 to 12 would cover distinct cases).

Wait, let's try n=1: 1 mod25, 1+1=2≠0.
n=2: 16, 16+1=17≠0.
n=3: 81 mod25=6, 6+1=7≠0.
n=4: 256 mod25. 25*10=250, 256-250=6, so 6+1=7≠0.
n=5: 0 mod25, 0+1=1≠0.
n=6: 1296 mod25. 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21, 21+1=22≠0.
n=7: 7⁴=49²=2401. 2401 - 25*96=2401 - 2400=1, so 1+1=2≠0.
n=8: 8⁴=4096 mod25. 4096 - 25*163=4096-4075=21, 21+1=22≠0.
n=9: 9⁴= (81)². 81 mod25=6, so 6²=36 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.
n=10: 10⁴=0 mod25, same as n=5.
n=11: 11⁴. 11²=121 mod25=21, so 21²=441 mod25. 441-25*17=441-425=16, 16+1=17≠0.
n=12: 12⁴. 12²=144 mod25=19, 19²=361 mod25=11, 11+1=12≠0.

Hmm, so none of n=1 to 12 satisfy n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25. Maybe I made a mistake? Or perhaps I need to check higher n? Or maybe p=5 doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe using properties of primes where -1 is a quartic residue.

I remember that for an odd prime p, -1 is a quartic residue mod p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because the multiplicative order of a quartic residue must divide (p-1)/4. So, perhaps for p ≡1 mod 8, -1 can be a fourth power.

Wait, but that's for modulo p, not p². So maybe for primes p where p² divides n⁴ +1, we need higher conditions.

Another approach: I recall that if p is an odd prime and p divides n² +1, then p ≡1 mod4. But here, we're dealing with n⁴ +1, which factors as (n² + i)(n² - i) in Gaussian integers, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I should use Hensel's lemma or lifting the exponent lemma (LTE) to see when a solution mod p can be lifted to mod p².

So, first, find a prime p where -1 is a quartic residue mod p. That is, there exists some n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Then, check if this can be lifted to a solution mod p².

So, first, find the smallest prime p where -1 is a quartic residue. Since -1 is a quadratic residue when p ≡1 mod4. But for quartic, perhaps p ≡1 mod8.

Wait, for example, p=17. 17 ≡1 mod8. Let me check if -1 is a quartic residue mod17.

Compute n⁴ mod17.

n=1:1, 2:16, 3:81 mod17=13, 4:256 mod17=1.

Wait, maybe I should find if any n⁴ ≡16 mod17, since 16≡-1 mod17.

n=2: 2⁴=16. So yes, n=2: 2⁴=16≡-1 mod17. So p=17 is such a prime where -1 is a quartic residue.

So, now, we have p=17. Let me check if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod17²=289.

To find such an n, perhaps I can use Hensel's lemma. Since we know that n=2 is a solution mod17, let's see if it can be lifted to mod289.

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) = n⁴ +1, and f'(n) ≠0 mod p, then the solution can be lifted uniquely mod p².

Compute f'(n) = 4n³. At n=2 mod17, n=2, so f'(2)=4*8=32≡15 mod17. Since 15≠0 mod17, Hensel's applies, so there's a unique lift of n=2 mod17 to a solution mod289.

So, the solution is n=2 +17k for some k. Plug into f(n) =0 mod289.

Compute (2 +17k)^4 +1 ≡0 mod289.

Using the binomial theorem, expand (2 +17k)^4:

= 2⁴ + 4*2³*(17k) + 6*2²*(17k)² + 4*2*(17k)³ + (17k)^4.

But since we're mod289=17², any term with 17² or higher will be 0 mod289.

So, terms beyond (17k)² and higher can be ignored.

So,

= 16 + 4*8*17k + 6*4*(17k)^2.

Compute each term:

16 remains as is.

4*8*17k = 32*17k = 544k. 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255, so 544k≡255k mod289.

6*4*(17k)^2 = 24*(289k²). Since 289k² is 0 mod289, this term is 0.

So, f(n) ≡16 +255k mod289.

Set f(n) ≡0 mod289:

16 +255k ≡0 mod289.

So, 255k ≡-16 mod289.

Compute 255 mod289 is 255. So, 255k ≡273 mod289 (since -16=273 mod289).

We can write this as 255k ≡273 mod289.

We can solve for k by finding the inverse of 255 mod289.

First, find gcd(255,289). 289=17²=289, 255=15*17. So, gcd(255,289)=17.

Wait, but 273 is divisible by 17? Let's check: 273/17=16.05... Wait, 17*16=272, so 273=17*16 +1. So 273≡1 mod17. Therefore, 255k ≡273 mod289.

But since 255 and 289 share a gcd of 17, and 17 divides 255 and 289, but 273 mod17 is 1, which is not 0. So, 17 doesn't divide 273. Therefore, the equation 255k ≡273 mod289 has no solution.

Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, I thought Hensel's lemma would work, but maybe I made a computational error.

Let me check my calculation again.

f(n) = (2 +17k)^4 +1.

Expanding,

=2^4 +4*(2^3)*(17k) +6*(2^2)*(17k)^2 +4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

As mod289, terms with (17k)^2=289k² are 0 mod289, so higher terms vanish.

So,

=16 +4*8*17k +6*4*(0) +0 +0.

Which is 16 + 544k.

Wait, 4*8=32, 32*17=544. So, 544 mod289.

Wait, 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So yes, 544k≡255k mod289.

So f(n)=16 +255k mod289.

Set to 0: 255k ≡ -16 mod289.

Which is 255k ≡273 mod289.

But since 255 and 289 share a gcd of 17, and 273 is 273 mod17=273-16*17=273-272=1. So 255k ≡273 mod289.

But gcd(255,289)=17. For the equation to have a solution, 17 must divide 273. But 273/17=16.058... So 17 doesn't divide 273. Hence, no solution.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, even though p=17 satisfies that -1 is a quartic residue mod17, there's no solution mod17². So, perhaps I need to check the next prime.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the next prime where -1 is a quartic residue is p=97. Because I remember that primes where -1 is a quartic residue are primes where p ≡1 mod8. The next primes after 17 are 41, 73, 97, etc.

Wait, let me check p=97.

Is there an n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod97?

Well, let me compute n=15: 15²=225≡225-2*97=225-194=31. 31²=961. 961 mod97: 97*9=873, 961-873=88. 88≡-9 mod97. Not -1.

n=10: 10²=100≡3 mod97. 3²=9≡9 mod97. Not -1.

n=13: 13²=169≡169-97=72. 72²=5184. Let's compute 5184 mod97. 97*53=5141, 5184-5141=43. 43≠96≡-1.

n=18: 18²=324. 324 mod97: 97*3=291, 324-291=33. 33²=1089. 1089 mod97: 97*11=1067, 1089-1067=22. Not -1.

n=5: 5²=25, 25²=625 mod97. 97*6=582, 625-582=43. 43≠96.

Hmm, maybe I should think of a better way to check if -1 is a quartic residue mod97.

Alternatively, perhaps p=257. But wait, 257 is 2^8 +1, which is 257≡1 mod8. Hmm, but let's check if there's a solution mod257²=65536.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should look for primes p where the multiplicative order of some element is 8, which would imply that -1 is a quartic residue.

Wait, perhaps I should check p=17 again. Since n=2 satisfies n⁴ ≡-1 mod17, but when I tried to lift it to mod17², it didn't work. So, perhaps I need to try the next prime where -1 is a quartic residue mod p.

Wait, let me list primes p≡1 mod8: 17, 41, 73, 97, 113, etc.

Let me try p=41.

Check if -1 is a quartic residue mod41.

Compute n⁴ ≡40 mod41.

Let me try n=3: 3⁴=81≡81-2*41=81-82=-1≡40 mod41. So, yes, n=3 satisfies 3⁴≡-1 mod41.

So, p=41 is a candidate. Now, let's see if there's a solution mod41²=1681.

Again, using Hensel's lemma. Since f(n)=n⁴ +1, and f'(n)=4n³.

At n=3 mod41, f'(3)=4*27=108. 108 mod41: 41*2=82, 108-82=26. So, 26≡ f'(3) mod41. Since 26≠0 mod41, Hensel's applies.

So, there's a unique lift of n=3 mod41 to mod41².

So, let me write n=3 +41k. Plug into f(n)=0 mod1681.

Compute (3 +41k)^4 +1 mod1681.

Again, expand using the binomial theorem up to terms that might affect mod1681.

(3 +41k)^4 = 3^4 +4*3^3*(41k) +6*3^2*(41k)^2 +4*3*(41k)^3 + (41k)^4.

Modulo 41²=1681, terms with (41k)^2 and higher are 0. So,

= 81 + 4*27*41k + 6*9*(41²k²).

But 41²k² is 0 mod1681, so only the first two terms matter.

Compute each term:

81 is 81.

4*27=108, 108*41=4428. 4428 mod1681: Let's compute how many times 1681 goes into 4428.

1681 * 2=3362; 4428-3362=1066.

So, 4428k ≡1066k mod1681.

So, f(n) ≡81 +1066k mod1681.

Set this equal to -1 mod1681:

81 +1066k ≡-1 mod1681 → 1066k ≡-82 mod1681.

Which is 1066k ≡1599 mod1681.

Now, we can solve for k.

First, compute the inverse of 1066 mod1681.

But to find the inverse, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(1066, 1681).

1681 ÷1066 = 1 with remainder 615.

1066 ÷615 = 1 with remainder 451.

615 ÷451 =1 with remainder 164.

451 ÷164=2 with remainder 123.

164 ÷123=1 with remainder 41.

123 ÷41=3 with remainder 0.

So, gcd is 41.

Check if 41 divides 1599.

1599 ÷41: 41*39=1599. So yes, 41 divides 1599.

Therefore, the equation 1066k ≡1599 mod1681 has solutions.

Since gcd(1066,1681)=41, and 41 divides 1599, we can divide the equation by 41:

(1066/41)k ≡1599/41 mod1681/41.

Compute 1066/41=26, 1599/41=39, 1681/41=41.

So, 26k ≡39 mod41.

Now, solve 26k ≡39 mod41.

Find the inverse of 26 mod41.

26x ≡1 mod41.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

41 =1*26 +15

26=1*15 +11

15=1*11 +4

11=2*4 +3

4=1*3 +1

3=3*1 +0.

Now, backtracking:

1=4 -1*3

=4 -1*(11 -2*4) =3*4 -11

=3*(15 -1*11) -11 =3*15 -4*11

=3*15 -4*(26 -1*15) =7*15 -4*26

=7*(41 -1*26) -4*26 =7*41 -11*26.

So, inverse of 26 mod41 is -11, which is 30 mod41.

So, k ≡39*30 mod41.

39*30=1170.

1170 ÷41: 41*28=1148, 1170-1148=22.

So, k≡22 mod41.

So, the solution is k=22 +41m, where m is an integer.

But since we're working mod41, the smallest positive k is 22.

So, n=3 +41*22=3 +902=905.

Wait, but we're working mod1681, so n=905 mod1681.

But let's check if 905⁴ +1 is indeed divisible by1681.

Compute 905 mod41: 41*22=902, so 905-902=3, so 905≡3 mod41, which makes sense.

But perhaps there's a smaller n. Wait, I'm looking for the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Since p=41 is the least prime where p² divides m⁴ +1, and m=3 +41k, the smallest positive m would be 3 +41k, where k=0 gives 3, but 3⁴ +1=81 +1=82, which is 82 mod1681≠0. So, k=22 gives m=905, which is a solution. But maybe there's a smaller m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

We have k≡22 mod41, so the smallest positive k is 22. So, n=3 +41*22=3 +902=905.

But maybe I can check if a smaller k works, like k=22 -41= -19, but that would give n=3 -41*19=3 -779=-776, which is negative, but mod1681, that's 1681-776=905. So, same as before.

So, the smallest positive integer m is 905.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought p=17 was a candidate, but the lifting didn't work because the equation had no solution. So, the next prime is p=41, which works, and the minimal m is 905.

Wait, but that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check if p=17 can't be made to work somehow.

Wait, when I tried p=17, I got to the equation 255k ≡273 mod289. Since 255 and 289 have a gcd of 17, and 273 is 273 mod17=1, which is not 0, so 17 doesn't divide 273, hence no solution. So, p=17 can't be used.

Thus, the next prime is p=41, and the minimal m is 905.

Wait, but 905 seems quite big. Maybe I can check a smaller p that I might have missed.

Wait, what about p=257? Let me check if p=257 is smaller than 41. No, 41 is smaller, so 41 is the first prime after 17 where -1 is a quartic residue mod p, and p²=1681.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a prime smaller than 41 that works. Let me check p=5, 13, etc.

Wait, earlier I checked p=5 and p=13, but perhaps I need to check again.

Wait, for p=5, n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25. Let me compute n=2: 16 +1=17≡17 mod25≠0.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod25: 2400 is 96*25, so 2401≡1 mod25. 1+1=2≠0.

n=12: 12⁴=20736. 20736 mod25: 20735 is 829*25, so 20736≡1 mod25. 1+1=2≠0.

Hmm, so p=5 doesn't work.

p=13: Let's check if there's an n with n⁴ ≡-1 mod13.

Compute n=5: 5²=25≡12≡-1, so 5⁴=(5²)²=(-1)²=1≡1 mod13. Not -1.

n=6: 6²=36≡10, 10²=100≡9 mod13. Not -1.

n=7: 7²=49≡10, same as n=6, so 7⁴=100≡9 mod13.

n=8:8²=64≡12≡-1, so 8⁴=(-1)^2=1≡1 mod13.

n=10:10²=100≡9, 9²=81≡3 mod13.

n=11:11²=121≡4, 4²=16≡3 mod13.

n=12:12²=144≡1, 1²=1 mod13.

Hmm, none of these give n⁴ ≡-1 mod13. So p=13 doesn't work.

So, the next prime is p=17, which didn't work for mod17², then p=41 worked.

So, the least prime p is 41, and the minimal m is 905.

Wait, but 905 seems quite big. Let me check if I did the Hensel's lemma correctly for p=41.

We had f(n) =n⁴ +1, f'(n)=4n³.

At n=3 mod41, f(n)=0 mod41, f'(3)=4*27=108≡26 mod41.

Then, (3 +41k)^4 ≡81 +4*27*41k mod41².

Wait, 4*27=108, 108*41=4428.

4428 mod1681: 1681*2=3362, 4428-3362=1066.

So, the expansion is 81 +1066k mod1681.

Set to 0: 81 +1066k ≡0 mod1681 → 1066k ≡-81 mod1681.

Wait, earlier I thought -1 mod1681 was 1680, but in the problem statement, I set f(n)=0 mod1681, which is n⁴ +1 ≡0 → n⁴≡-1 mod1681.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. When I set f(n)=0, it's (3 +41k)^4 +1 ≡0 mod1681, which is (3 +41k)^4 ≡-1 mod1681.

But in the calculation, I expanded (3 +41k)^4 as 81 +1066k, and set 81 +1066k ≡-1 mod1681.

So, 1066k ≡-82 mod1681.

Wait, that's correct. So, 1066k ≡1599 mod1681, since -82=1599 mod1681.

Then, I tried to solve 1066k ≡1599 mod1681.

We found that gcd(1066,1681)=41, and 1599=41*39, so the equation reduces to 26k≡39 mod41, which has solution k=22 mod41.

So, the solution is n=3 +41*22=3 +902=905.

So, m=905 is the minimal positive integer for p=41.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smaller m for p=41.

Wait, maybe I can find a smaller k that satisfies the equation 26k ≡39 mod41.

We found the inverse of 26 mod41 is 30, so k=39*30 mod41=1170 mod41=22 mod41.

So, k=22 is the smallest positive solution.

Thus, n=3 +41*22=905.

So, the minimal m is 905.

Wait, that seems correct.


To solve the problem, we first need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Primes Where \( -1 \) is a Quartic Residue Modulo \( p \):**
   - For an odd prime \( p \), \( -1 \) is a quartic residue modulo \( p \) if \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \). This is because the multiplicative order of a quartic residue must divide \( (p-1)/4 \), implying \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).

2. **Check Small Primes \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \):**
   - The smallest primes \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) are 17, 41, 73, 97, etc.
   - **For \( p = 17 \):**
     - \( n = 2 \) satisfies \( 2^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \).
     - Using Hensel's Lemma to lift this solution to modulo \( 17^2 = 289 \):
       - Solve \( (2 + 17k)^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 289 \).
       - After expansion and simplification, the equation reduces to \( 255k \equiv 273 \mod 289 \).
       - However, \( \gcd(255, 289) = 17 \), and since 17 does not divide 273, there is no solution modulo \( 289 \).
   - **For \( p = 41 \):**
     - \( n = 3 \) satisfies \( 3^4 \equiv -1 \mod 41 \).
     - Using Hensel's Lemma to lift this solution to modulo \( 41^2 = 1681 \):
       - Solve \( (3 + 41k)^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 1681 \).
       - After expansion and simplification, the equation reduces to \( 1066k \equiv 1599 \mod 1681 \).
       - Solving, we find \( k \equiv 22 \mod 41 \), so the smallest \( k \) is 22.
       - Thus, \( n = 3 + 41 \times 22 = 905 \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The smallest prime \( p \) for which there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is \( p = 41 \).
   - The smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 41^2 = 1681 \) is \( m = 905 \).

### Final Answer:
The least positive integer \( m \) is \(\boxed{905}\).
