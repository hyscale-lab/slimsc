Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis. I think sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so it's a bit less than 1.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is a line segment from a point P on the x-axis to a point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one such segment in F, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB. The distance between A and B can be found using the distance formula: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of length 1, lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, AB is part of the family F.

Now, the point C is on AB but not on any other segment of F. So, C is unique in that sense. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express that as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Alright, so to approach this, I think I need to find all possible segments PQ in F and then find the point C on AB that isn't covered by any other PQ except AB itself.

First, let's parametrize segment AB. AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equations for AB can be written as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t
y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So, any point C on AB can be represented as (1/2 - (1/2)t, sqrt(3)/2 t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, for C to not lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB, it must be that for no other PQ in F does the point C lie on PQ. So, we need to find the point C on AB that is not intersected by any other PQ from F.

So, the family F consists of all unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Let's think about what these segments look like.

Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis at (p, 0) and Q on the y-axis at (0, q), such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Hence, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Additionally, since we're in the first quadrant, p and q are non-negative. So, p ranges from 0 to 1, and q ranges from 0 to 1 as well, but constrained by p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, the segments PQ are all the lines connecting (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2=1.

Now, each such segment can be expressed as a line. Let me find the equation of such a line PQ.

The line connecting (p, 0) and (0, q) has slope m = (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p.

So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Alternatively, since p^2 + q^2=1, we can express q in terms of p, or vice versa.

So, q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So, the equation becomes y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2).

Alternatively, we can express p in terms of q: p = sqrt(1 - q^2), so the equation becomes y = (-sqrt(1 - q^2)/q)x + sqrt(1 - q^2).

But perhaps it's easier to work with parameters.

Alternatively, maybe we can parameterize the family with a parameter theta, thinking of the points P and Q as projections from a unit circle. But wait, since the distance from P to Q is 1, and P is on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, the points (p,0) and (0,q) lie on a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. So, yes, they can be parameterized as (cos(theta), 0) and (0, sin(theta)), but since p and q are non-negative, theta ranges from 0 to pi/2.

Wait, if we set p = cos(theta), then q = sin(theta), because p^2 + q^2 = cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) =1.

So, parametrizing the family F with theta in [0, pi/2], each PQ corresponds to theta, with P at (cos(theta), 0) and Q at (0, sin(theta)).

So, the equation of the line PQ for a given theta is:

It goes from (cos(theta), 0) to (0, sin(theta)), so the slope is (sin(theta) - 0)/(0 - cos(theta)) = -tan(theta).

So, the equation is y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

Alternatively, we can write this as:

y = (-sin(theta)/cos(theta))x + sin(theta).

Which simplifies to y = (-sin(theta) x)/cos(theta) + sin(theta).

Alternatively, we can write it as y = sin(theta)(1 - x / cos(theta)).

So, that's the equation of the line PQ for a given theta.

Now, the point C is on AB. So, as I mentioned earlier, its coordinates are (1/2 - (1/2)t, sqrt(3)/2 t) for some t in (0,1). So, let me denote point C as (x, y) = (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2) t).

Alternatively, since t is between 0 and 1, let me perhaps express this in terms of a parameter s, where s = t, so s in (0,1).

So, x = (1 - s)/2, y = (sqrt(3) s)/2.

Now, for point C to not lie on any other PQ in F except AB, which corresponds to a particular theta. So, AB itself is a PQ in F, so we can find the theta for which PQ is AB.

So, let's find theta such that the line PQ passes through A and B.

Wait, AB is a segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the line AB has slope (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Point A is (1/2, 0), point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2).

So, the slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which becomes y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, let's see which theta in our parametrization corresponds to this line.

From earlier, the line PQ for angle theta is y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

So, comparing to the equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, equate the two:

-tan(theta) x + sin(theta) = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, matching coefficients:

tan(theta) = sqrt(3), so theta = pi/3, since tan(pi/3) = sqrt(3).

And sin(theta) = sqrt(3)/2, which is consistent because sin(pi/3) = sqrt(3)/2.

So, theta = pi/3 corresponds to the segment AB.

So, the line AB is PQ for theta = pi/3.

So, now, for any other theta ≠ pi/3, the line PQ(theta) will not be AB.

Now, point C is on AB, but not on any other PQ(theta) except for theta = pi/3.

Therefore, we need to find a point C on AB such that for all theta ≠ pi/3, C is not on PQ(theta).

Alternatively, for C to be on AB and not on any other PQ, except AB, the point C must not lie on any other PQ(theta) for theta ≠ pi/3.

Therefore, for any other PQ(theta), C should not satisfy the equation of PQ(theta).

So, we can write the condition that for any theta ≠ pi/3, the coordinates of C do not satisfy the equation y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

So, given that C is on AB, we can write the coordinates of C as ( (1 - s)/2 , (sqrt(3) s)/2 ), where s is between 0 and 1.

So, let's substitute x = (1 - s)/2 and y = (sqrt(3) s)/2 into the equation of PQ(theta):

y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

So,

(sqrt(3) s)/2 = -tan(theta) * (1 - s)/2 + sin(theta).

Multiply both sides by 2:

sqrt(3) s = -tan(theta) (1 - s) + 2 sin(theta).

Now, let's rearrange:

sqrt(3) s + tan(theta) (1 - s) = 2 sin(theta).

Let me express tan(theta) as sin(theta)/cos(theta):

sqrt(3) s + (sin(theta)/cos(theta))(1 - s) = 2 sin(theta).

Multiply both sides by cos(theta) to eliminate the denominator:

sqrt(3) s cos(theta) + sin(theta)(1 - s) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta).

Now, let's collect terms:

sqrt(3) s cos(theta) + sin(theta) - s sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta).

Bring all terms to one side:

sqrt(3) s cos(theta) + sin(theta) - s sin(theta) - 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = 0.

Factor terms with sin(theta) and cos(theta):

[ sqrt(3) s cos(theta) - 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) ] + [ sin(theta) - s sin(theta) ] = 0.

Factor cos(theta) from the first bracket and sin(theta) from the second:

cos(theta) [ sqrt(3) s - 2 sin(theta) ] + sin(theta) [1 - s ] = 0.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can factor differently.

Wait, perhaps we can factor terms with s:

sqrt(3) s cos(theta) - s sin(theta) + sin(theta) - 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = 0.

Factor s from the first two terms:

s [ sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) ] + sin(theta) - 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = 0.

So,

s [ sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) ] + sin(theta)(1 - 2 cos(theta)) = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So, for a given theta, this equation relates s and theta.

But we need to find s such that this equation has only one solution for theta, which is theta = pi/3 (since that's the AB segment). For other thetas, we don't want this equation to hold because that would imply that point C lies on another PQ segment.

So, perhaps we can think of this equation as holding for a particular theta (pi/3). But to ensure that for all other thetas, the equation doesn't hold, we need to find s such that the equation doesn't have a solution for theta ≠ pi/3.

Alternatively, maybe we can solve for s in terms of theta and then find s such that for all theta ≠ pi/3, s is not given by that expression.

Wait, let's try solving for s:

From the equation:

sqrt(3) s = -tan(theta) (1 - s) + 2 sin(theta).

Wait, let me go back to an earlier step:

sqrt(3) s = -tan(theta) (1 - s) + 2 sin(theta).

Let me express tan(theta) as sin(theta)/cos(theta):

sqrt(3) s = - (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) (1 - s) + 2 sin(theta).

Multiply both sides by cos(theta):

sqrt(3) s cos(theta) = - sin(theta) (1 - s) + 2 sin(theta) cos(theta).

Hmm, maybe it's better to solve for s in terms of theta:

Let me rearrange the equation:

sqrt(3) s cos(theta) + sin(theta)(1 - s) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta).

Expanding:

sqrt(3) s cos(theta) + sin(theta) - s sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta).

Gather terms with s:

s ( sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) ) + sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta).

So, moving sin(theta) to the right:

s ( sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) ) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) - sin(theta).

Factor sin(theta) on the right:

s ( sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) ) = sin(theta) (2 cos(theta) - 1).

Thus,

s = [ sin(theta) (2 cos(theta) - 1) ] / [ sqrt(3) cos(theta) - sin(theta) ].

So, for each theta ≠ pi/3, this gives an s that would place point C on PQ(theta). But we need to find s such that this equation doesn't hold for any theta ≠ pi/3. That is, for the chosen s, the above equality doesn't hold for any other theta.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of for a given s, there's at most one theta that satisfies the equation. Then, since we want s such that the only theta is pi/3.

So, our goal is to choose s such that the only solution to the equation is theta = pi/3.

So, perhaps we can set the equation above to have only one solution, i.e., discriminant zero or something.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider that the point C lies on AB, and for any other PQ segment, the point C must not lie on that segment. So, perhaps the point C is the intersection point of AB with all other PQ(theta), but only AB contains C.

Wait, but that's not quite right. The point C must lie on AB and not on any other PQ(theta). So, it's the point on AB that is only intersected by AB from the family F, and no other PQ(theta).

Alternatively, maybe the point C is such that it's the only point on AB that is not covered by any other PQ(theta).

Wait, perhaps the envelope of the family F of segments PQ(theta) is a curve, and point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope, then it only touches the envelope at one point, which is C, and doesn't intersect any other PQ(theta) except at C.

Alternatively, maybe the envelope of the family F is a curve that the segments PQ(theta) are tangent to, and AB is one such tangent line, touching the envelope at point C.

So, perhaps we can find the envelope of the family F and find where AB is tangent to this envelope.

The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, in this case, the family F consists of lines PQ(theta), each of which is a straight line. The envelope would be a curve that each PQ(theta) is tangent to.

So, to find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the envelope of the family of lines given by F(theta) = 0, where F(theta) is the equation of the line PQ(theta).

So, the equation of PQ(theta) is:

y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

Alternatively, we can write this as:

y + tan(theta) x - sin(theta) = 0.

So, F(theta, x, y) = y + tan(theta) x - sin(theta) = 0.

The envelope is found by solving the system:

F(theta, x, y) = 0

dF/dtheta = 0

So, compute dF/dtheta.

F(theta, x, y) = y + x tan(theta) - sin(theta).

So, dF/dtheta = x sec^2(theta) - cos(theta).

So, the two equations are:

1. y + x tan(theta) - sin(theta) = 0

2. x sec^2(theta) - cos(theta) = 0

We can solve this system for x, y, and theta.

Let me write equation 2:

x sec^2(theta) = cos(theta).

So, x = cos^3(theta)/x? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, equation 2: x sec^2(theta) - cos(theta) = 0.

So, x sec^2(theta) = cos(theta).

So, x = cos(theta) / sec^2(theta) = cos^3(theta).

So, x = cos^3(theta).

Now, substitute x = cos^3(theta) into equation 1:

y + cos^3(theta) * tan(theta) - sin(theta) = 0.

Simplify tan(theta):

tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta).

So,

y + cos^3(theta) * (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) - sin(theta) = 0.

Simplify:

y + cos^2(theta) sin(theta) - sin(theta) = 0.

Factor sin(theta):

y + sin(theta)(cos^2(theta) - 1) = 0.

But cos^2(theta) - 1 = -sin^2(theta).

So,

y - sin(theta) sin^2(theta) = 0.

So,

y = sin^3(theta).

So, the envelope is given by x = cos^3(theta), y = sin^3(theta).

So, parametric equations for the envelope are:

x = cos^3(theta)

y = sin^3(theta)

So, the envelope is the astroid defined by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Wait, let me check. If x = cos^3(theta), then x^(1/3) = cos(theta). Similarly, y^(1/3) = sin(theta). So, (x^(1/3))^2 + (y^(1/3))^2 = cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1. So, indeed, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 is the envelope.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Now, the idea is that each PQ(theta) is tangent to this astroid.

So, the segment AB is one of these PQ(theta), specifically for theta = pi/3, as we found earlier.

Now, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. So, if AB is tangent to the astroid at point C, then C is the only point where AB intersects the astroid, meaning that C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope (the astroid).

Therefore, to find point C, we can find the point of tangency between line AB and the astroid.

So, let's find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We can substitute this into the astroid equation and solve for x, but since it's tangent, there should be exactly one solution, so the discriminant will be zero.

Let me proceed.

Substitute y from AB into the astroid equation:

x^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1.

Let me denote this as:

x^(2/3) + [ sqrt(3)( -x + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1.

Let me factor out sqrt(3) inside the second term:

[ sqrt(3) (1/2 - x) ]^(2/3) = [ (sqrt(3))^(2/3) * (1/2 - x)^(2/3) ) ].

Note that (sqrt(3))^(2/3) = (3^(1/2))^(2/3) = 3^(1/3).

So, the second term becomes 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - x)^(2/3).

So, the equation becomes:

x^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) (1/2 - x)^(2/3) = 1.

Let me denote u = x^(1/3), v = (1/2 - x)^(1/3).

Then, u^2 + (3^(1/3)) v^2 = 1.

But I'm not sure if this substitution helps. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify.

Let me let t = x^(1/3), so x = t^3.

Similarly, (1/2 - x)^(1/3) = (1/2 - t^3)^(1/3) = v.

But this might complicate things further.

Alternatively, let's let z = x^(1/3), so x = z^3.

Then, (1/2 - x) = (1/2 - z^3).

So, the equation becomes:

z^2 + 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - z^3)^(2/3) = 1.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the derivative of the astroid and set it equal to the slope of AB, since at the point of tangency, their slopes must be equal.

The astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Differentiating both sides implicitly with respect to x:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0.

So,

dy/dx = - [ x^(-1/3) / y^(-1/3) ] = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)).

So, the slope of the astroid at any point (x, y) is - (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)).

Now, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). Therefore, at the point of tangency, the slope of the astroid must be equal to the slope of AB.

So,

- (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).

So,

(y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).

Cube both sides:

(y / x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).

So,

y = 3 sqrt(3) x.

But the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, at the point of tangency, both equations must hold. Therefore,

3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me solve for x.

Bring terms with x to one side:

3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.

Factor sqrt(3) x:

sqrt(3) x (3 + 1) = sqrt(3)/2.

So,

sqrt(3) x * 4 = sqrt(3)/2.

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4 x = 1/2.

So,

x = 1/(8).

So, x = 1/8.

Now, find y using the equation of AB:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, the point of tangency is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Therefore, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Now, we need to compute OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1/64) + (27/64) = (28)/64 = 7/16.

Wait, let me compute that again.

(1/8)^2 = 1/64.

(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64.

So, adding them: 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

So, OC^2 = 7/16.

Therefore, p = 7 and q = 16, which are coprime. So, p + q = 23.

Wait, but before I conclude, let me double-check whether point C is indeed on AB.

AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, our point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). Let me see if this lies on AB.

Parametrize AB as before:

x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3) t)/2, where t is from 0 to 1.

So, set x = 1/8:

(1 - t)/2 = 1/8 => 1 - t = 1/4 => t = 3/4.

Then, y should be (sqrt(3) * 3/4)/2 = (3 sqrt(3))/8, which matches. So, yes, point C is on AB at t = 3/4.

Additionally, since we found that the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, and point C is the point where AB is tangent to this astroid, it's the only point where AB touches the astroid, meaning that for all other segments PQ(theta), point C is not on them.

Therefore, OC^2 is indeed 7/16, so p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.


To solve the problem, we first note that the segment \( \overline{AB} \) is part of the family \( \mathcal{F} \) of unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis. The point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) that does not lie on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) is the point where \( \overline{AB} \) is tangent to the envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \).

The envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \) is an astroid given by \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \). The line \( \overline{AB} \) has the equation \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \sqrt{3}/2 \). To find the point of tangency, we set the slope of the astroid equal to the slope of \( \overline{AB} \), leading to the point \( C \) at \( (1/8, 3\sqrt{3}/8) \).

The distance from the origin to \( C \) is calculated as:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \), giving \( p + q = 23 \).

\boxed{23}
