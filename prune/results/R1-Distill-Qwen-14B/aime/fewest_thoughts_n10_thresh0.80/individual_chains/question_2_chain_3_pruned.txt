Okay, I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and point B is somewhere along the y-axis, a bit more than halfway since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Then, we have this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. Point P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, with the length of PQ being 1. 

The problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one such segment in F, right? Because AB connects A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB to confirm it's a unit length.

Calculating AB's length: the distance between (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). Using the distance formula, sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yes, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, the family F consists of all possible unit-length segments connecting the x-axis and y-axis points in the first quadrant. Each such segment PQ can be represented parametrically. Since P is on the x-axis, let's denote P as (p, 0), and Q as (0, q) on the y-axis. The condition is that PQ has length 1, so sqrt[p^2 + q^2] = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Thus, all such segments PQ can be described by p and q satisfying p^2 + q^2 = 1, with p > 0 and q > 0 because we're in the first quadrant.

Now, the point C is on AB, different from A and B. So, AB is the segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me parametrize AB. I can write parametric equations for AB.

Let me let t be a parameter between 0 and 1. When t=0, we're at A (1/2, 0), and when t=1, we're at B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the coordinates of any point on AB can be written as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, for t in [0,1], we have the entire segment AB.

So, point C is somewhere on AB, so its coordinates can be written as ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1.

The key point is that C is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, we need to find such a point C on AB that it's only on AB and no other PQ.

So, our goal is to find the coordinates of point C such that it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ in F.

Hmm, how can we approach this? Maybe we can think of the envelope of all the segments in F and see where AB is tangent to this envelope. The point of tangency would be the point C, which is only on AB and no other PQ.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the set of all segments PQ in F and find their common intersection with AB, and then find the point C on AB that isn't intersected by any other PQ except AB.

Wait, but the problem states that C is on AB and isn't on any other PQ. So, perhaps for every other PQ in F, the line PQ doesn't pass through C.

So, perhaps we can model this as: For point C on AB, we need that no other PQ in F passes through C. So, for all other unit segments PQ (except AB), the line PQ does not pass through C.

So, if we can find such a point C, it must satisfy that for any other PQ in F, the line PQ doesn't pass through C.

Alternatively, the point C is such that the only PQ in F that passes through it is AB.

So, how can we model this? Let's think algebraically.

Let me denote C as (x, y), lying on AB. So, since C is on AB, we have the equation of line AB.

Wait, equation of AB: It connects (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's find its equation.

The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, equation: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but that seems incorrect because when x=0, y should be sqrt(3)/2, but plugging x=0 gives y = sqrt(3)/2, which is correct. When x=1/2, y= -sqrt(3)(1/2) + sqrt(3)/2 = 0, which is correct. So, the equation is correct.

So, any point C on AB is of the form (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).

Now, for any other segment PQ in F, which connects (p, 0) to (0, q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1, the line PQ must not pass through C.

So, for point C, the line PQ must not pass through it. So, the equation of PQ can be written as:

It goes from (p, 0) to (0, q). The slope is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p.

So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Wait, because when x=0, y=q, and when x=p, y=0.

So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

So, if we substitute the coordinates of C into this equation, it shouldn't hold unless PQ is AB.

So, for point C = (x, y) on AB, substituting into PQ's equation: y = (-q/p)x
