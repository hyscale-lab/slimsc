Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, looking at the product: ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That looks like a product over all the 13th roots of unity, but I need to handle each term carefully.

Wait, for k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that first term is 1. For the other terms, when k=1 to 12, I guess I can factor or find some symmetry.

Let me see if I can rewrite the term 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe factor something out. Let's write it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, maybe that's a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set z = ω^k. Then each term becomes z² - 2z + 2.

So the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (z² - 2z + 2), where z = ω^k. But since ω is a primitive 13th root, as k goes from 0 to 12, z goes through all the 13th roots of unity. So the product is essentially the product of (z² - 2z + 2) evaluated at each 13th root of unity z.

Wait a second, if z is a root of unity, then the product over all z (13th roots) of (z² - 2z + 2) is equal to the resultant when we consider the polynomial f(z) = z² - 2z + 2 evaluated at each z, and multiplied together. So, the product would be the same as evaluating the product of f(z) for all z being the 13th roots of unity.

But how do I compute that product? I remember that for a polynomial P(z), the product over all roots of another polynomial Q(z) is related to the resultant or something like that. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as evaluating the resultant of f(z) and the minimal polynomial of z.

Since the minimal polynomial for z is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1, but I'm not sure how that connects.

Wait, another approach: The product of (z - a) for all roots z of Q(x) is equal to Q(a). So if I have a polynomial Q(x) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k), which is x¹³ - 1 because all 13th roots of unity are the roots. So, if I have another polynomial f(z) = z² - 2z + 2, then the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) is equal to the product of f(z) evaluated at each root z of x¹³ - 1 = 0.

But I think there's a formula for this. If I have a polynomial P(x) = x^n - 1, then the product of (a - ω^k) for k=0 to n-1 is equal to P(a). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think.

Alternatively, suppose I have a polynomial F(z) = z² - 2z + 2. Then the product over all z (the 13th roots of unity) of F(z) is equal to the resultant of F(z) and the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(z). Or maybe it's related to evaluating F(z) at all z and multiplying together.

Wait, another idea: The product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z - ω^k) = z¹³ - 1. So, if I have another polynomial G(z) = something, then the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} G(ω^k) is equal to the resultant of G(z) and z¹³ - 1. But I'm not too familiar with resultants. Maybe a better approach is to use the fact that for any polynomial P(z), the product over k of (a - ω^k) is equal to P(a), where P(z) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are ω^k. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps an even better approach is to think about the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z² - 2z + 2) where z = ω^k. So, for each ω^k, I plug it into z² -
