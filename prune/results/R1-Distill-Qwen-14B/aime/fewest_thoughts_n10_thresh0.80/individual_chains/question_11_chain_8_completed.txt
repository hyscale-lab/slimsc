Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z|=4. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that z is a complex number, and it's given that its magnitude is 4. So, |z| = 4. That means z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can express z as 4(cosθ + isinθ). Maybe that will come in handy later.

The expression we're dealing with is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote this expression as E. So, E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since we're interested in the real part of E, let's denote Re(E) as the real part. So, Re(E) = Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z].

I think I can break this down into two parts: Re[(75 + 117i)z] and Re[(96 + 144i)/z], and then add them together.

Let me first handle Re[(75 + 117i)z]. Since z is a complex number, multiplying it by another complex number (75 + 117i) will result in another complex number. Similarly, dividing (96 + 144i) by z will also give another complex number. So, I need to compute both real parts and sum them up.

But since z has magnitude 4, maybe we can use that to simplify things. Let me represent z as 4e^{iθ}, as I thought earlier. Then, 1/z will be (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression, E becomes:

E = (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (1/4)*(96 + 144i)*e^{-iθ}.

Now, let me compute the coefficients:

First term's coefficient: 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

Second term's coefficient: (1/4)*(96 + 144i) = 24 + 36i.

So, E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, now I can write e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

Let me substitute these into the expression:

E = (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Now, I'll expand each product.

First, expand (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ):

= 300*cosθ + 300*i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

Similarly, expand the second term (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ):

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

Now, add both expanded terms together to get E.

Adding the real parts:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Adding the imaginary parts:

(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i = [300 sinθ - 24 sinθ + 468 cosθ + 36 cosθ] i.

= (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i.

So, E has real part Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, and imaginary part Im(E) = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But since we're only interested in Re(E), which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, we can focus on that.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, this is a linear combination of cosθ and sinθ. I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is R.

So, let's compute R for Re(E).

Given a = 324 and b = -432.

Then, R = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Calculating 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.

324^2:

Well, 300^2 = 90,000.

24^2 = 576.

And cross term 2*300*24 = 14,400.

So, (300 + 24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2.

Let me compute 400^2 = 160,000.

32^2 = 1,024.

Cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600.

So, (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What is sqrt(291,600)?

Well, 540^2 is 291,600 because 54^2=2916, so 540^2=291600. So, R = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of Re(E) is R, which is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure. The expression is a cosθ + b sinθ, which is equal to R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²). So the maximum value is indeed R.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations for R.

a = 324, b = -432.

Compute a²: 324^2 = 104,976.

b²: (-432)^2 = 186,624.

Sum: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

sqrt(291600) = 540, because 540 * 540 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. Yep, that's correct.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because when you have a cosθ + b sinθ, the maximum value is indeed sqrt(a² + b²). So, in this case, 540 is the maximum value.

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

I think that's the answer. Let me recap:

1. Express z as 4e^{iθ}.

2. Substitute into the expression and expand.

3. Combine real parts and imaginary parts.

4. Notice that Re(E) is a linear combination of cosθ and sinθ.

5. Find its amplitude (R) to get the maximum value.

Everything seems to check out. So, the maximum real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting \(z\) into the expression, we have:

\[
E = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}.
\]

Simplifying each term:

1. \((75 + 117i) \cdot 4 = 300 + 468i\),
2. \(\frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i\).

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
E = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Expanding using \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\):

\[
E = (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta).
\]

Combining real and imaginary parts:

\[
\text{Re}(E) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta,
\]
\[
\text{Im}(E) = 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta.
\]

To find the maximum real part, we rewrite \(\text{Re}(E)\) as \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) with \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\). The maximum value is given by the amplitude \(R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\):

\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
