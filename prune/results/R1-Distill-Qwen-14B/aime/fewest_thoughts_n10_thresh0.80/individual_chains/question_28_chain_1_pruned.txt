Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so it's like the edges are paired with equal lengths. I remember that in such a tetrahedron, it might have some symmetry, maybe like an isosceles tetrahedron or something. 

The question is about finding the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. All these distances are equal, so point I must be the incenter of the tetrahedron, analogous to the incenter of a triangle. The distance we're looking for is the inradius, and it can be expressed in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then we need to find m + n + p.

Alright, so first, I need to recall how to find the inradius of a tetrahedron. I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius r can be found by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So I need to calculate both the volume and the total surface area.

But wait, how do I find the volume of such a tetrahedron? Since all edges are given in pairs, maybe it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such tetrahedrons are sometimes called isosceles tetrahedrons. I recall that in such cases, there's a formula for volume that might relate to the edge lengths, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.

Let me try that approach. If I can assign coordinates to the four vertices, I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product. But how? I need to choose coordinates such that the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Let me think. Let's place vertex A at (0,0,0). Then, maybe place vertex B at (a,0,0), vertex C at (0,b,0), and vertex D somewhere in 3D space, say (0,0,c). Wait, but then I need to ensure that the distances AB, AC, AD, etc., match the given lengths.

Wait, AB is sqrt(41). If A is at (0,0,0) and B is at (a,0,0), then AB distance is |a| = sqrt(41), so a = sqrt(41). So B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).

Similarly, AC is sqrt(80). If C is at (0, b, 0), then AC is |b| = sqrt(80), so b = sqrt(80). So C is at (0, sqrt(80), 0).

Now, AD is sqrt(89). If D is at (0,0
