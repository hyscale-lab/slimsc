Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives us two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. We need to find how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the information given.

First scenario: She walks at a constant speed of s km/h, and the total time taken is 4 hours. This time includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals 4 hours.

Second scenario: She walks at a speed of s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, this includes the same t minutes in the coffee shop.

Our goal is to find the total time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h, which includes t minutes as well.

Wait, so the t minutes are the same in both scenarios, right? So, the coffee shop time doesn't change; it's always t minutes. That means the difference in total time between the two scenarios is due to the difference in walking speed.

Let me think about how to model this.

In the first scenario, the time she spends walking plus the coffee shop time is 4 hours. Similarly, in the second scenario, walking time plus coffee shop time is 2 hours and 24 minutes.

I should convert all times into the same units to make calculations easier. Let's convert everything into minutes.

So, 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

2 hours and 24 minutes is (2 * 60) + 24 = 120 + 24 = 144 minutes.

So, in the first case: walking time + t = 240 minutes.

In the second case: walking time + t = 144 minutes.

Wait, but the walking time will change with speed. Since the distance is the same, 9 km, the walking time should be less when she walks faster.

Let me define variables more clearly.

Letâ€™s denote:

- Distance walked: D = 9 km

- Speed in first scenario: s km/h

- Speed in second scenario:
