Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem says:

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers, and then find m + n.

Alright, let's visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, from point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, we draw line AD which meets the circumcircle again at P. We need to find AP.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB and DC are equal because they're both tangents from D to ω. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Also, because D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, point D is called the ex-similicenter or something like that? Wait, ex-similicenter is the external homothety center. Hmm, maybe that's a stretch. Alternatively, point D is the pole of BC with respect to the circumcircle ω. Hmm, maybe that's useful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use power of a point. Since D lies outside the circle ω, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². Power of a point is also equal to DA * DP, since AD passes through ω, so Power of D: DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate it to DA and DP, which could help me find AP, since AP = DP - DA or something? Wait, no. Let's think. If AD is a line from A passing through P, and point D is outside, then in terms of power of a point, we have:

Power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DA * DP, because AD intersects ω at A and P, so DA * DP is the power. So, DB² = DA * DP.

But I need AP. If I can find DA, then DP = DB² / DA, so AP = DP - DA? Wait, no. Because AP is the distance from A to P along AD, so if AD is the entire length from A to D, then P is somewhere between A and D. So, AP is the length from A to P, which is less than AD. So, the power formula would be DB² = AP * (AD). So, AP * AD = DB².

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to the square of the tangent from D to ω, which is DB (or DC, since they're equal). So, DB² = DA * DP, where DP is the length from D to P. But DP = DA + AP, because P is between A and D. So, DA * (DA + AP) = DB².

Wait, but I think the formula is that if a line from D intersects the circle at two points, say X and Y, then the power is DX * DY = DB². In our case, the line AD intersects ω at A and P, so the power is DA * DP = DB². So, DA * DP = DB².

So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP as DB² / DA, and then AP = DP - DA. Because AD is from A to D, so P lies between A and D, so AP = DP - DA. Hmm, but wait
