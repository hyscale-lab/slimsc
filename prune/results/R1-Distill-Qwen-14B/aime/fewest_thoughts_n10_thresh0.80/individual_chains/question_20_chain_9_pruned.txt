Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to parse it out step by step.

So, we have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable within their colors. We need to place some of these chips in the 25 cells of a 5x5 grid. The conditions are:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip. That's straightforward—no more than one chip per cell.

2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Hmm, that's interesting. So, each row can only have white or black chips, but not a mix. Same for each column. So, for example, if I have a white chip in the first row, first column, then the entire first row must be white, and the entire first column must be white as well. But wait, that might not necessarily hold because each column also has to have all the same color. So if a column has a white chip, all the chips in that column must be white. So, this could get tricky because the color of a row affects the color of a column and vice versa.

3. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. That means the placement we have is maximal—there's no room to add another chip without breaking the row or column color rules.

So, the problem is asking for the number of ways to place some chips under these conditions.

Alright, let's think about how to model this.

Each row must be all white or all black, but wait, no—because a row can have some chips or none. Wait, no, condition 2 says all chips in the same row have the same color. So that means a row can be either all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or have no chips.

Wait, but condition 2 says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So that implies that if a row has at least one chip, all of its chips must be the same color. Similarly for columns.

But a row can have zero chips, in which case there's no color constraint for that row. Same for
