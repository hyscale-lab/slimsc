Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. 

She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. And she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen ones. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A โฉ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, we need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize, P(A and B) is just P(A). So, it simplifies to P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability of winning the grand prize and the probability of winning any prize. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about how many ways there are to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination C(10,4). The total number of possible outcomes when 4 numbers are chosen is C(10,4).

Calculating that: C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, the total number of possible combinations is 210.

Now, let's find the probability of winning the grand prize. That happens when Jen's 4 numbers are exactly the 4 chosen. Since there's only one such combination, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. So, the probability P(A) is 1/210.

Next, we need to find the probability of winning a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers match the chosen four. Hmm, that can be a bit tricky because "at least two" includes two, three, or four matches. Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1.

The complementary event of winning a prize is when she has fewer than two matches, i.e., zero or one match. So, P(B) = 1 - P(no matches) - P(exactly one match).

So, let's compute P(no matches) and P(exactly one match).

First, P(no matches): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that none of them are in Jen's chosen 4. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). 

Calculating C(6,4) is 15. So, P(no matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Next, P(exactly one match): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers where exactly one is from Jen's 4 numbers and the other three are from the remaining 6 numbers. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3). 

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. So, P(exactly one match) = 80 / 210 = 8/21.

Therefore, P(no matches or exactly one match) = 15/210 + 80/210 = 95/210. Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me double-check that. 15 + 80 is 95. 210 - 95 is 115, so yes, 115/210.

Simplify 115/210: divide numerator and denominator by 5. 115 รท 5 = 23, 210 รท5=42. So, 23/42.

So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, but actually, hold on. Wait, 115/210 simplifies to 23/42, which is correct. Because 115 divided by 5 is 23, and 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, yes.

But earlier, I thought P(B) is the probability of at least two matches, which is 115/210, which is 23/42.

Wait, but in the problem statement, she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, the number of favorable outcomes for event B is the number of 4-number combinations that have at least two overlapping with Jen's 4 numbers.

So, let me confirm the numbers. The total possible is 210.

Number of combinations with exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2). C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.

Number with exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 *6=24.

Number with exactly 4 matches: 1.

So, total number of favorable for event B is 90 +24 +1 =115. So, yes, 115/210, which is 23/42.

So, P(B) is 23/42.

And P(A) is the probability of exactly 4 matches, which is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, is that correct? Because P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210. So, when you take (1/210) divided by (115/210), the 210s cancel out, giving 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115, which are coprime. So
