Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm. Let me recall some properties of circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius R is given as 13, so that's the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. The inradius r is 6, so that's the radius of the inscribed circle.

The condition given is IA perpendicular to OI. So, the line segment from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line segment from the incenter I to the circumcenter O.

I think it might help to draw a diagram, but since I can't draw, I'll try to visualize it. So, triangle ABC, with O somewhere outside or inside? Hmm, depends on the triangle. But since both O and I are defined, it's a valid triangle.

Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. Hmm, maybe I can express this using coordinates or vectors. But maybe there's a property or theorem that relates these?

I remember that in triangle geometry, there are relations between the inradius, circumradius, and other elements. One formula that comes to mind is the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me confirm that. Yes, that's a standard formula where OI squared equals R times (R minus twice the inradius). So OI² = R(R - 2r).

Given that R is 13 and r is 6, let's compute OI.

OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Wait, that's interesting.

But we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IOA is a right triangle at I. Wait, is that true? Because IA is perpendicular to OI, which would mean that the angle at I between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So yes, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

So in triangle IOA, we have sides IO, IA, and OA. OA is the circumradius, which is R=13. So OA = 13, IO is sqrt(13), and IA is the length from inradius to A, which I need to find.

Wait, IA is the distance from the inradius I to vertex A. Is there a formula for that? I think the length of the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me set up a coordinate system with point I at the origin. Then, OI is along some axis, say the x-axis. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, IA would be
