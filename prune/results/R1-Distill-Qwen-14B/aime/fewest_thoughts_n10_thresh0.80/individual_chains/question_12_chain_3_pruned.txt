Okay, so I've got this problem here about filling a 2x3 grid with digits. The goal is to have the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right equal 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom equal 99. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, let's visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Each cell will contain a single digit from 0 to 9. Let me denote the grid as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, the first row is a, b, c; the second row is d, e, f.

Now, when we read left to right, the first number is formed by the top row, which is abc, and the second number is formed by the bottom row, which is def. So, the sum is abc + def = 999. 

When we read top to bottom, each column forms a number. So, the first column is ad, the second column is be, and the third column is cf. Their sum should be ad + be + cf = 99.

So, the problem is to find the number of possible digit arrangements in the grid that satisfy both these conditions.

Let me write out the equations based on these observations.

First, the sum of the two numbers (from left to right):

The top row, abc, is a three-digit number, which is 100a + 10b + c.

The bottom row, def, is another three-digit number, which is 100d + 10e + f.

So, 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999. Let's call this Equation (1).

Second, the sum of the three numbers (from top to bottom):

Each column is a two-digit number. The first column ad is 10a + d.

The second column be is 10b + e.

The third column cf is 10c + f.

So, (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Let's call this Equation (2).

Our goal is to find the number of integer solutions (a, b, c, d, e, f) where each variable is a digit (0-9) satisfying both equations.

Let me reorganize both equations:

Equation (1):
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation (2):
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Hmm, perhaps I can express Equation (1) in terms that relate to Equation (2). Let's see.

Let me subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1). Let me see what that gives.

Equation (1) - Equation (2):

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99.

Simplify the left side:

100a -10a = 90a,

10b -10b = 0,

c remains,

100d -d = 99d,

10e -e = 9e,

f -f = 0.

So, the left side is 90a + c + 99d + 9e.

Right side is 900.

So, 90a + c + 99d + 9e = 900.

Let me factor 9 out of some terms:

90a = 9*10a,

99d = 9*11d,

9e = 9*e,

c remains.

So, 9*(10a + 11d + e) + c = 900.

Let me write this as:

c + 9*(10a + 11d + e) = 900. Equation (3).

Now, c is a single digit (0-9), so c can be from 0 to 9. Let's consider that.

I can rearrange Equation (3) as:

c = 900 - 9*(10a + 11d + e).

But c must be between 0 and 9, inclusive.

So, 0 ≤ 900 - 9*(10a + 11d + e) ≤ 9.

Let me rewrite this as:

900 - 9*(10a + 11d + e) ≥ 0 → 9*(10a + 11d + e) ≤ 900 → 10a + 11d + e ≤ 100.

And,

900 - 9*(10a + 11d + e) ≤ 9 → 900 - 9 ≤ 9*(10a + 11d + e) → 891 ≤ 9*(10a +11d +e) → 99 ≤ 10a +11d +e.

So, we have:

99 ≤ 10a +11d +e ≤ 100.

Because 10a +11d +e is an integer (since a, d, e are integers), the possible values for 10a +11d +e are 99 and 100.

So, two cases:

Case 1: 10a +11d + e = 99.

Then, c = 900 - 9*99 = 900 - 891 = 9.

Case 2: 10a +11d + e = 100.

Then, c = 900 - 9*100 = 900 - 900 = 0.

So, either c=9 or c=0, depending on whether 10a +11d +e is 99 or 100.

Let me note that down.

Now, let's handle each case separately.

Starting with Case 1: 10a +11d +e = 99 and c=9.

And Case 2: 10a +11d +e = 100 and c=0.

Our variables are a, b, c, d, e, f, each from 0-9, except a and d cannot be zero because they are the first digits of three-digit numbers. Wait, wait: the grid is 2x3, so the numbers formed by left-right are two three-digit numbers. So, the top row is a three-digit number, which requires a ≠ 0, and the bottom row is a three-digit number, so d ≠ 0.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column is a two-digit number, which requires that a, b, c cannot be zero? Wait, no: a is the first digit of the first column ad, so a can't be zero. Similarly, b is the first digit of be, so b can't be zero. Similarly, c is the first digit of cf, so c can't be zero. So, a, b, c must be from 1-9, and d, e, f from 0-9.

Wait, let me confirm.

In the grid:

a b c

d e f

When reading top to bottom, each column is a two-digit number:

First column: ad (so a is the tens digit, d is the units digit). Therefore, a cannot be zero, but d can be zero.

Similarly, second column: be (b cannot be zero), third column: cf (c cannot be zero).

So, the variables a, b, c must be from 1-9 (since they are the first digits of the two-digit numbers in their respective columns). Variables d, e, f can be from 0-9.

But in the left-right reading, the top row is abc, which is a three-digit number, so a cannot be zero, and the bottom row is def, so d cannot be zero.

So, in summary:

a ∈ {1,2,...,9}

b ∈ {1,2,...,9}

c ∈ {1,2,...,9}

d ∈ {1,2,...,9}

e ∈ {0,1,...,9}

f ∈ {0,1,...,9}

So, that's an important point. So, a, b, c, d must be from 1-9, while e and f can be 0-9.

Now, let's proceed.

Starting with Case 1: 10a +11d +e = 99 and c=9.

We also have Equation (2): 10a + d +10b + e +10c + f = 99.

But in this case, c=9, so substituting c=9 into Equation (2):

10a + d +10b + e +90 + f = 99.

Simplify:

10a + d +10b + e + f = 99 -90 = 9.

So, 10a + d +10b + e + f = 9. Equation (2a).

But let's also recall that in Equation (1), we have:

100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f =999.

In this case, c=9, so:

100a +10b +9 +100d +10e +f =999.

Subtract 9:

100a +10b +100d +10e +f = 990.

Simplify:

100a +100d +10b +10e +f =990.

Factor:

10*(10a +10d + b + e) + f =990.

Divide both sides by 10:

10a +10d + b + e + (f/10) =99.

But f is a digit, so f/10 must be an integer or less than 1. But f is between 0 and 9, so f/10 is 0 when f=0, and 0.1, 0.2,... up to 0.9 otherwise. But since the left side must be an integer (because all other terms are integers), f must be 0. Because 10a +10d +b +e is an integer, and adding f/10 must also result in an integer. Therefore, f must be 0.

So, f=0.

Then, Equation (1a):

10a +10d + b + e =99.

But from Equation (2a): 10a +d +10b +e +f =9, and since f=0:

10a + d +10b + e =9. Equation (2b).

So, now we have two equations:

Equation (1a): 10a +10d + b + e =99.

Equation (2b): 10a + d +10b + e =9.

Let me write these down:

10a +10d + b + e =99. (1a)

10a + d +10b + e =9. (2b)

Let me subtract equation (2b) from equation (1a):

(10a +10d + b + e) - (10a + d +10b + e) =99 -9.

Simplify:

(10a -10a) + (10d -d) + (b -10b) + (e -e) =90.

So,

9d -9b =90.

Divide both sides by 9:

d - b =10.

So, d = b +10.

But wait, d and b are digits from 1-9. So, d= b +10 would imply that d is at least 11, which is impossible because d can only be up to 9. So, this is a contradiction.

Hmm, that suggests that in Case 1, where c=9, there's no solution because d - b =10 is impossible. Therefore, Case 1 has zero solutions.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, all possibilities under Case 1 are invalid.

So, we can discard Case 1 and move on to Case 2.

Case 2: 10a +11d +e =100 and c=0.

Again, we have Equation (2):

10a +d +10b +e +10c +f =99.

Since c=0, this becomes:

10a +d +10b +e +f =99.

Equation (2c).

Also, from Equation (1):

100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f =999.

Substituting c=0:

100a +10b +100d +10e +f =999.

Equation (1b).

So, now we have:

Equation (1b): 100a +10b +100d +10e +f =999.

Equation (2c): 10a +d +10b +e +f =99.

Let me subtract Equation (2c) from Equation (1b):

(100a +10b +100d +10e +f) - (10a +d +10b +e +f) =999 -99.

Simplify:

90a +99d +9e =900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a +11d +e =100.

Which is exactly our initial condition for Case 2. So, that's consistent.

So, now, let's see what else we can derive.

Let me write down:

From Equation (2c):

10a +d +10b +e +f =99.

We can express f as f =99 -10a -d -10b -e.

But f must be a digit, so f ∈ {0,1,...,9}.

Thus, 0 ≤99 -10a -d -10b -e ≤9.

Which means:

99 -10a -d -10b -e ≥0 → 10a +d +10b +e ≤99.

And,

99 -10a -d -10b -e ≤9 → 10a +d +10b +e ≥90.

So,

90 ≤10a +d +10b +e ≤99.

Let me note that.

Also, from Case 2, 10a +11d +e =100.

Let me denote equation (2c) as:

10a +d +10b +e +f=99.

But f is determined as above.

So, perhaps I can express e in terms of other variables.

From 10a +11d +e =100, we get e =100 -10a -11d.

Substitute this into Equation (2c):

10a +d +10b + (100 -10a -11d) +f =99.

Simplify:

10a -10a + d -11d +10b +100 +f =99.

So,

(-10d) +10b +100 +f =99.

Which simplifies to:

-10d +10b +f = -1.

Multiply both sides by 1:

10b -10d +f = -1.

Rearranged:

10(b -d) +f = -1.

Hmm, 10(b -d) is a multiple of 10. So, 10*(b -d) is equal to some integer. Let me denote k = b -d.

So, 10k +f = -1.

But f is a digit between 0 and9. So, 10k +f = -1.

Since f is non-negative, 1
