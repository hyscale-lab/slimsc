Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions like this, it's often useful to express z in its polar form. Since |z| = 4, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That way, I can separate the modulus and the angle, which might make things easier to handle.

So, let's write z = 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because the reciprocal of e^{iθ} is e^{-iθ}, and the modulus becomes 1/|z|.

Now, substituting these into the expression:

(75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}
(96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately.

First, (75 + 117i)*4. Let me calculate that. 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468. So, that part becomes (300 + 468i). So, the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Similarly, (96 + 144i)/4 is 24 + 36i. So, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now the original expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

I need to find the real part of this expression. Let's recall that for any complex number a + ib, the real part is a.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

First, I'll compute (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}. Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So, multiplying this by (300 + 468i):

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Grouping like terms:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i

Similarly, compute (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. So:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Grouping terms:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

Now, adding the two results together:

First term's real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Second term's real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Total real part: (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Similarly, the imaginary parts are:

First term: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i
Second term: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i
Total imaginary part: [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ] i
= (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i

But since we're only interested in the real part, let's focus on that. So, the real part of the entire expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, we need to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

This is a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be rewritten in the form R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is R, so I need to compute R here.

Alternatively, another approach is to recognize that any expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, the maximum value is C, and the minimum is -C.

Wait, but in this case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is similar to A cosθ + B sinθ, except B is negative.

So, let me compute C = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Calculating 324^2: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.

324 * 300 = 97,200
324 * 24 = 7,776
So, 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.

Similarly, (-432)^2 is 432^2. Let's compute that.

400^2 = 160,000
32^2 = 1,024
Cross term: 2*400*32 = 25,600
So, 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291600)? Let me see.

I know that 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2 = (500
