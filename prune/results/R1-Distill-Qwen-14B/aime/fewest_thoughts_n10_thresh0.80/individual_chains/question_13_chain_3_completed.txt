Okay, so I've got this problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop stops. Hmm, let me read it again and try to parse it out.

So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She has two different walking speeds, and each time, she includes some time in a coffee shop. The problem gives me two scenarios: one where she walks at a constant speed of 's' km/h and takes 4 hours including 't' minutes in the coffee shop. The other scenario is when she walks at 's + 2' km/h and takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including 't' minutes in the coffee shop. They want to know how long her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Alright, let's break this down. It seems like I need to find the values of 's' and 't' first, and then use those to find the time when her speed is 's + 1/2'.

So, the distance she walks each day is constant at 9 km. The time she takes depends on her walking speed, but both instances include the same amount of time 't' at the coffee shop.

First, let's convert all the times into the same units to make it easier. The first case is 4 hours, but the second is 2 hours and 24 minutes. I'll convert everything into minutes.

4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

2 hours and 24 minutes is (2 * 60) + 24 = 120 + 24 = 144 minutes.

Wait, but the problem says these times include 't' minutes in the coffee shop. So, the time she spends walking is the total time minus 't'.

So, for the first scenario:
Total time = 240 minutes = walking time + t.

Walking time = (240 - t) minutes.

Similarly, for the second scenario:
Total time = 144 minutes = walking time + t.

Walking time = (144 - t) minutes.

Now, since we know the distance and the walking speed, we can relate walking time to speed. Time = distance / speed. But here, the speed is in km/h, and the walking time is in minutes. I should convert the walking time to hours to match the units.

So, for the first scenario:
Walking time in hours = (240 - t)/60 hours.

And since speed = distance/time, we have s = 9 / [(240 - t)/60].

Similarly, for the second scenario:
Walking time in hours = (144 - t)/60 hours.

And the speed is (s + 2) = 9 / [(144 - t)/60].

So now, I have two equations:

1) s = 9 / [(240 - t)/60]
2) s + 2 = 9 / [(144 - t)/60]

I can rewrite these equations to make them easier to handle.

Let me simplify equation 1:
s = 9 * [60 / (240 - t)] = (540) / (240 - t)

Similarly, equation 2:
s + 2 = 9 * [60 / (144 - t)] = (540) / (144 - t)

So now I have:
s = 540 / (240 - t)  ...(1)
s + 2 = 540 / (144 - t)  ...(2)

Now, let's substitute s from equation (1) into equation (2). So equation (2) becomes:

[540 / (240 - t)] + 2 = 540 / (144 - t)

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's try to solve for t.

Let me denote A = 540 for simplicity.

So, equation becomes:
A/(240 - t) + 2 = A/(144 - t)

Let me rearrange this:

A/(240 - t) - A/(144 - t) = -2

Factor out A:

A [1/(240 - t) - 1/(144 - t)] = -2

Compute the difference inside the brackets:

1/(240 - t) - 1/(144 - t) = [(144 - t) - (240 - t)] / [(240 - t)(144 - t)]

Simplify numerator:

144 - t -240 + t = 144 -240 = -96

So, the difference becomes:

(-96) / [(240 - t)(144 - t)]

Putting back into the equation:

A * (-96) / [(240 - t)(144 - t)] = -2

Since A is 540:

540 * (-96) / [(240 - t)(144 - t)] = -2

Let's multiply both sides by [(240 - t)(144 - t)] to eliminate the denominator:

540 * (-96) = -2 * (240 - t)(144 - t)

Simplify both sides:

Left side: 540 * (-96) = Let's calculate that. 540 * 96. Hmm, 500*96=48,000, 40*96=3,840. So total 51,840. But it's negative, so -51,840.

Right side: -2*(240 - t)(144 - t). Let's leave it as is for now.

So:

-51,840 = -2*(240 - t)(144 - t)

Divide both sides by -2:

(-51,840)/(-2) = (240 - t)(144 - t)

Which is 25,920 = (240 - t)(144 - t)

Now, expand the right side:

(240 - t)(144 - t) = 240*144 -240t -144t + t^2 = 240*144 - (240+144)t + t^2

Compute 240*144: Let's see, 200*144 = 28,800; 40*144=5,760. So total 34,560.

And 240 +144 = 384. So:

= 34,560 - 384t + t^2

So, equation becomes:

t^2 -384t +34,560 =25,920

Subtract 25,920 from both sides:

t^2 -384t + 34,560 -25,920 =0

Compute 34,560 -25,920: 8,640.

So equation is:

t^2 -384t +8,640=0

This is a quadratic equation in t: t² -384t +8640 =0

Let me try to solve for t using quadratic formula.

Quadratic equation: at² + bt +c =0; solutions t=(-b ±√(b²-4ac))/2a

Here, a=1, b=-384, c=8640.

So discriminant D = b² -4ac = (-384)^2 -4*1*8640.

Compute (-384)^2: 384*384. Let me compute 400^2=160,000. 384 is 16 less. So (400-16)^2 = 400² - 2*400*16 +16² = 160,000 -12,800 +256= 160,000-12,800=147,200; 147,200 +256=147,456.

So D=147,456 -4*8640.

Compute 4*8640=34,560.

So D=147,456 -34,560= 112,896.

Now, sqrt(112,896). Let me see, 336² is 112,896 because 300²=90,000, 30²=900, so 330²=108,900. 336²= (330+6)^2=330² +2*330*6 +6²=108,900 + 3,960 +36=112,896. Yes!

So sqrt(D)=336.

Thus, t=(384 ±336)/2.

Compute both possibilities.

First, t=(384+336)/2=(720)/2=360.

Second, t=(384-336)/2=48/2=24.

So t=360 or t=24.

Wait, but t is the time spent in the coffee shop. In the first scenario, the total time including t is 240 minutes. So t can't be 360 because that would mean she spent 360 minutes in the coffee shop, which is 6 hours, but her total time was only 4 hours (240 minutes). So 360 is impossible. Thus, t must be 24 minutes.

So t=24.

Now, let's find s.

From equation (1): s=540/(240 - t)=540/(240-24)=540/216.

Simplify 540 divided by 216.

Divide numerator and denominator by 36: 540 ÷36=15, 216 ÷36=6. So 15/6 =2.5.

Wait, 540 ÷ 216 is the same as 540/216. Let me compute that:

540 ÷ 216 = 2.5. Because 216*2=432. 540-432=108. 216*0.5=108. So 2.5.

So s=2.5 km/h.

Wait, that seems quite slow for a walking speed. Hmm, but okay, maybe she walks slowly and spends a lot of time in the coffee shop.

So, now we have s=2.5 km/h, t=24 minutes.

Now, the question is, what is the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

s +1/2 =2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So her speed is 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time, which is walking time + t.

So, first, compute walking time: time = distance/speed =9 km /3 km/h=3 hours.

Convert that to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes.

But wait, the coffee shop time is t=24 minutes. So total time is 180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem says when she walks at s+1/2, find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Yes, so it's the walking time plus t.

Wait, but let me make sure that when she walks at 3 km/h, she only needs 3 hours for the 9 km walk, which is 180 minutes. Then, add the 24 minutes coffee shop time, totaling 204 minutes.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Walking speed: 3 km/h. Distance:9 km.

Time=9/3=3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Plus 24 minutes coffee: 180+24=204.

So, the total time is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make any prior mistakes in solving for s and t.

Earlier, I had t=24 and s=2.5 km/h.

Let me check if these satisfy the initial two scenarios.

First scenario: speed s=2.5 km/h.

Walking time:9/2.5=3.6 hours. 3.6 hours is 3 hours and 36 minutes, which is 216 minutes.

But the total time including t is 240 minutes. So, if walking time is 216 minutes, then t=240-216=24 minutes. That matches.

Second scenario: speed s+2=4.5 km/h.

Walking time:9/4.5=2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

Total time including t is 144 minutes. So, t=144 -120=24 minutes. That also matches.

So, yes, s=2.5 and t=24 are correct.

Thus, when she walks at 3 km/h, the walking time is 3 hours (180 minutes), plus 24 minutes coffee, totaling 204 minutes.

So, the answer should be 204 minutes.


Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. When walking at a speed of \( s \) km/h, her total time, including \( t \) minutes in a coffee shop, is 4 hours (240 minutes). When walking at \( s + 2 \) km/h, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (144 minutes), including the same \( t \) minutes. We need to find the total time when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h.

First, convert the total times into minutes and express the walking times as:
\[
\text{Walking time at } s \text{ km/h} = \frac{9}{s} \text{ hours} = \frac{240 - t}{60} \text{ hours}.
\]
\[
\text{Walking time at } (s + 2) \text{ km/h} = \frac{9}{s + 2} \text{ hours} = \frac{144 - t}{60} \text{ hours}.
\]

From these, we derive two equations:
\[
s = \frac{540}{240 - t},
\]
\[
s + 2 = \frac{540}{144 - t}.
\]

Substituting \( s \) from the first equation into the second:
\[
\frac{540}{240 - t} + 2 = \frac{540}{144 - t}.
\]

Simplify and solve for \( t \):
\[
\frac{540}{240 - t} - \frac{540}{144 - t} = -2,
\]
\[
540 \left( \frac{1}{240 - t} - \frac{1}{144 - t} \right) = -2,
\]
\[
\frac{-96 \cdot 540}{(240 - t)(144 - t)} = -2,
\]
\[
25,920 = (240 - t)(144 - t).
\]

Expanding and solving the quadratic equation:
\[
t^2 - 384t + 8,640 = 0.
\]

Using the quadratic formula:
\[
t = \frac{384 \pm 336}{2}.
\]

This gives \( t = 24 \) minutes (since \( t = 360 \) is not feasible).

Substitute \( t = 24 \) into the first equation to find \( s \):
\[
s = \frac{540}{216} = 2.5 \text{ km/h}.
\]

When walking at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:
\[
\text{Walking time} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes},
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}.
\]

The total time, including coffee shop time, is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
