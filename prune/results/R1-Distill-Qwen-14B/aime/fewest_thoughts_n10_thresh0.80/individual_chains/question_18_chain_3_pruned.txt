Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I know a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length and with equal angles between them. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? But I'm not sure how that helps right now.

The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, I'm thinking that each side of the rectangle must align with one of these lines. Therefore, maybe I need to consider all possible lines (sides and diagonals) and see how they can form rectangles.

Wait, in a regular polygon, the sides are all the same, but the diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, the diagonals can connect to vertices two apart, three apart, etc., up to five apart because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating on the other side.

Wait, let's think. In a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is n(n-3)/2, but each diagonal is counted multiple times depending on the step between vertices. So for a dodecagon (n=12), the number of distinct diagonals would be 12*(12-3)/2 = 54. But each diagonal can be of different lengths based on how many steps apart the vertices are.

But maybe I don't need to count diagonals, but rather think about the possible lines that can form the sides of the rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, a rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel sides, each pair corresponding to the same step of diagonals or sides.

Wait, in a regular polygon, opposite sides are parallel, but the steps between vertices determine the direction of the diagonals.

So, maybe for each possible step size (like 1 step, 2 steps, etc.), the lines with that step can be considered as one set of parallel lines. Then, to form a rectangle, I need two different step sizes, and the lines from these steps must intersect each other.

But how does that translate to the number of
