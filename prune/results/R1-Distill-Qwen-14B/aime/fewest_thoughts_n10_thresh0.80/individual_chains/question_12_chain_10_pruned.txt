Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits. The conditions are that when you read the numbers left to right, the sum is 999, and when you read the numbers top to bottom, the sum is 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8 and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1. So, reading left to right gives 008 + 991 = 999, and reading top to bottom gives 09 + 91 = 99 + 91 = 190, wait, that doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the example says 8 + 991 = 999? Oh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the numbers are formed.

Wait, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. So, when reading left to right, each row forms a number. So, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991. So, 8 + 991 = 999, that works. Then, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a number. So, the first column is 0 and 9, making 09, which is 9. The second column is 0 and 9, making 09 again, which is 9. The third column is 8 and 1, making 81. So, 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. That makes sense now.

So, the problem is essentially about assigning digits to the 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers (top and bottom rows) is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers (each column) is 99.

Let me denote the grid as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the top row is the number abc, which is 100a + 10b + c. The bottom row is def, which is 100d + 10e + f. The sum of these two is:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

So, 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly, the columns are ad, be, cf. So, each is a two-digit number: 10a + d, 10b + e, 10c + f. Their sum is:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Which can be written as 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So, let me write down the two main equations:

1. 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.
2. 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Also, all variables a, b, c, d, e, f are digits, meaning they can be from 0 to 9. But wait, a and d are the first digits of 3-digit numbers. Wait, no, the top row is a 3-digit number, so a can be 0? Because in the example, a is 0. So, yes, a can be 0, making the top row a number like 008. So, a, b, c, d, e, f can all be digits from 0 to 9.

Let me think about the first equation:

100(a + d) + 1
