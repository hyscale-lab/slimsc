Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, p² | n⁴ +1. That means when we divide n⁴ +1 by p², there's no remainder. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that for primes p, if p divides a number, then certain conditions must hold. Maybe I should start by looking at small primes and see if any of them satisfy this condition.

Let's list the primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. I'll check each one to see if p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Starting with p=2: p²=4. Let's see if 4 divides n⁴ +1. Let's try n=1: 1⁴ +1=2. 2 mod 4 is 2, not 0. n=2: 16 +1=17. 17 mod 4 is 1. n=3:81 +1=82, which mod4 is 2. So, seems like for p=2, n⁴ +1 ≡ 2 mod4 for odd n, and 1 mod4 for even n. So 4 never divides n⁴ +1. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3: p²=9. Let's see if 9 divides n⁴ +1. Let's compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since modulo 9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1⁴=1, 1 +1=2 mod9=2
n=2: 16 mod9=7, 7+1=8 mod9=8
n=3: 81 mod9=0, 0+1=1 mod9=1
n=4: (4^4)=256 mod9. Let me compute 256/9=28*9=252, so 256-252=4. So 4+1=5 mod9=5
n=5: 5^4=625. 625 mod9: 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. So 4+1=5 mod9=5
n=6: 6^4=1296. 1296 mod9=0, 0+1=1 mod9=1
n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, but wait, that's for another test. Alternatively, 7 mod9 is 7, 7²=49 mod9=4, 7^4=(7²)^2=4²=16 mod9=7. So 7+1=8 mod9=8.
n=8: 8 mod9=8, 8²=64 mod9=1, so 8^4=(8²)^2=1²=1 mod9. So 1+1=2 mod9=2.

So, for p=3, n⁴ +1 mod9 cycles through 2,8,1,5,5,1,8,2 for n=1 to 8. None of these are 0 mod9. So 9 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5: p²=25. Let's check for n=1 to 12 (since mod25 cycles every 25 numbers). Maybe there's a pattern or perhaps a specific n where n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way than brute force. For p=5, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. So, we can think of this as n⁴ ≡24 mod25.

Looking for n such that n⁴ ≡24 mod25.

Hmm, perhaps we can find n such that n² ≡ something mod25, then square it again.

Alternatively, think of n mod5 first. For n⁴ ≡ -1 mod5, because if p divides n⁴ +1, then n⁴ ≡-1 mod p. So for p=5, n⁴ ≡-1 mod5. But let's see: n^4 mod5.

Fermat's little theorem says n^4 ≡1 mod5 if n not divisible by5. So n^4 mod5 is either 0 (if n is multiple of5) or 1. So 1 ≡-1 mod5 would mean 1 ≡4 mod5? No, because 1-4=-3≡2 mod5≠0. So n⁴ ≡-1 mod5 would require 1≡4 mod5, which is false. Thus, there's no n such that 5 divides n⁴ +1. Therefore, p=5 is out.

Wait, that's a good point. So if p=5 cannot divide n⁴ +1 because n⁴ mod5 is either 0 or 1, so n⁴ +1 mod5 is either 1 or 2. So 5 cannot divide n⁴ +1. So p=5 is not a candidate.

Next prime: p=7. So p²=49. Let's see if 49 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Again, maybe we can check n modulo7 first. Let's see if 7 divides n⁴ +1. So n⁴ ≡-1 mod7.

Compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to6 (since mod7 has 6 residues coprime to7):

n=1: 1 mod7
n=2: 16 mod7=2
n=3:81 mod7. 7*11=77, 81-77=4. So 4 mod7
n=4: 256 mod7. 7*36=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod7
n=5:625 mod7. 7*89=623, 625-623=2. So 2 mod7
n=6: 6^4=1296 mod7. 7*185=1295, 1296-1295=1. So 1 mod7.

Wait, n^4 mod7 for n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:4, n=4:4, n=5:2, n=6:1.

So n^4 ≡1,2,4 mod7. So is -1 mod7=6. So 6 is not in the set {1,2,4}, which means there's no n where
