Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, okay.

Let me start by recalling some concepts. The circumradius (R) of a triangle is the radius of the circumscribed circle, which passes through all three vertices. The inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle, which is tangent to all three sides. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that must form a right angle at point I. So, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle. Maybe I can use some properties or theorems related to this configuration.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me plug in the values here. R is 13, r is 6. So, OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1=13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13). That might be useful later.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle OIA is right-angled. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = OI² + IA². Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA². That simplifies to 169 = 13 + IA². Subtracting 13 from both sides gives IA² = 156, so IA is sqrt(156). Hmm, sqrt(156) can be simplified. 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39)=2*sqrt(39). So, IA is 2*sqrt(39).

But what is IA? IA is the distance from the incenter I to vertex A. There's a formula for the length of the inradius from the incenter to a vertex. Wait, no, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to the sides, not the vertices. So IA is a segment from the inradius to vertex A, which is different.

I think there's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex in terms of the sides of the triangle and other known quantities. Let me recall. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is indeed IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)²), where s is the semiperimeter. So, in this case, IA is
