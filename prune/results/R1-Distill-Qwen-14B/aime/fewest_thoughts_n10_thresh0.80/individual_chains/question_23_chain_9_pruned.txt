Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis length is \(2\sqrt{20}\), which simplifies to \(2 \times 2\sqrt{5}\), so \(4\sqrt{5}\). The conjugate axis is \(2\sqrt{24}\), which is \(2 \times 2\sqrt{6}\), so \(4\sqrt{6}\).

Now, the problem says there's a rhombus ABCD with points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, and they meet at the origin. 

I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Also, all four points lie on the hyperbola.

So, let me think about the properties of the rhombus. The diagonals intersect at the origin, so if one diagonal is AC, then the other is BD. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

Let me denote the points. Let me say that points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are the endpoints of the other diagonal. Since diagonals intersect at the origin, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q). 

Because all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So for point A: \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), and same for point B: \(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1\).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But maybe there's a better way to approach this. Since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin, I can parametrize the points in terms of vectors. Let me think in terms of vectors.

Let me denote vector OA as \(\vec{a}\) and vector OB as \(\vec{b}\). Since the diagonals bisect each other, point A is \(\vec{a}\), point B is \(\vec{b}\), point C is \(-\vec{a}\), and point D is \(-\vec{b}\).

So, the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals must be perpendicular, so vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Vector AC is \(\vec{a} - (-\vec{a}) = 2\vec{a}\), and vector BD is \(\vec{b} - (-\vec{b}) = 2\vec{b}\). So, for these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. 

So, \( (2\vec{a}) \cdot (2\vec{b}) = 0 \). Which simplifies to \(4 (\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}) = 0\). So, \(\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = 0\). That means vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.

Wait, that makes sense since the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors from the origin to points A and B are perpendicular.

So, now, points A and B are on the hyperbola, and their position vectors are perpendicular. So, the coordinates of A are (x, y) and B are (p, q), with \(\vec{a} = (x, y)\) and \(\vec{b} = (p, q)\). So, the dot product is \(x p + y q = 0\).

Additionally, both points satisfy the hyperbola equation:

For A: \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).

For B: \(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1\).

So, we have these two equations, plus the condition \(x p + y q = 0\).

Our goal is to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD squared, but since it's a rhombus, BD is one of the diagonals. So, BD is the distance from B to D, but since D is (-p, -q), BD is the distance between (p, q) and (-p, -q). 

Wait, no. Wait, BD is the diagonal from B to D. Since in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, points B and D are opposite vertices, connected by diagonal BD. So, the length of BD is the distance between B and D, which is the distance between (p, q) and (-p, -q). So, that distance is \(\sqrt{(p - (-p))^2 + (q - (-q))^2}\) which simplifies to \(\sqrt{(2p)^2 + (2q)^2} = 2\sqrt{p^2 + q^2}\). So, BD squared is \((2\sqrt{p^2 + q^2})^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\).

Similarly, AC squared would be \(4(x^2 + y^2)\).

So, our goal is to find the least upper bound for BD squared, which is 4 times the sum of squares of p and q, given that points A and B lie on the hyperbola and their position vectors are perpendicular.

So, we need to maximize \(p^2 + q^2\) given that \(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1\) and \(x p + y q = 0\), with \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).

Hmm, this is getting a bit involved. Maybe I can express x in terms of y or vice versa from the hyperbola equation and then substitute into the dot product condition.

Wait, but I have two points, A and B, each lying on the hyperbola, and
