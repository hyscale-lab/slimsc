Okay, so I have this triangle ABC where O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter. The problem says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c by the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area. The inradius r is related by Δ = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. Here, R is 13 and r is 6. So maybe I can use these relations somehow.

Also, the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI might involve some coordinate geometry or vector analysis. But since I don't have coordinates, maybe I can use properties of triangle centers and their distances.

I recall that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me plug in R=13 and r=6. So OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13). 

Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI, so maybe I can consider the triangle formed by I, O, and A. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle IOA, IA is one leg, OI is the other leg, and OA is the hypotenuse. But OA is the circumradius, so OA = R =13.

So, by Pythagoras theorem, we have (IA)^2 + (OI)^2 = OA^2. Plugging in the known values: IA^2 + (sqrt(13))^2 = 13^2. So IA^2 +13 = 169. Therefore, IA^2 = 156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). 

Hmm, okay, so now I know IA is 2*sqrt(39). But how does that help me find AB·AC?

I remember that in a triangle, the length from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Specifically, IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius. Let me verify that formula.

Yes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2). But we found IA = 2*sqrt(39). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Let me solve for sin(A/2):

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13.

So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Let me compute cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169-39)/169 = 130/169. Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, I remember that in a triangle, the product AB·AC can be expressed in terms of sides and angles. Let me think about the formula for the area. The area Δ = (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A. But I don't know sin A yet. Alternatively, I can express AB and AC in terms of other variables.

Wait, another approach: In any triangle, the product AB·AC can be related to the sides and the semiperimeter. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a. Then, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

I recall that the inradius r = Δ/s, so Δ = r*s = 6s.

Also, the area can be expressed using the formula Δ = (abc)/(4R). So, Δ = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52. But Δ is also 6s. Therefore, (a*b*c)/52 = 6s => a*b*c = 312s.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Let me see if I can find another relation.

Since I know sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), maybe I can find sin A and cos A. Let me compute sin A using the double angle formula: sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).

So sin A = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*(sqrt(39*130))/169.

Let me compute sqrt(39*130). 39*130 = 39*13*10 = 507*10 = 5070. So sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 factors into 10*507, 507 is 13*39, which is 13*13*3, so 5070 = 2*3*13^2*5. So sqrt(5070) = 13*sqrt(30). Because sqrt(2*3*5*13^2) = 13*sqrt(30).

So sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26*sqrt(30))/169 = (2*sqrt(30))/13.

So sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

Now, the area of the triangle is Δ = (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A.

Wait, but also Δ = r*s = 6s. So, 6s = (1/2)*AB*AC*(2*sqrt(30)/13).

Simplify: 6s = (AB*AC*sqrt(3
