Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

The expression I have is a product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that down more clearly:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I need to compute this product. Since ω is a root of unity, maybe I can find a clever way to express this product in terms of cyclotomic polynomials or something else.

Wait, maybe I can factor each term. Let me look at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x². Let me write that as x² - 2x + 2.

So, each term is x² - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k. So, the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) where x is each 13th root of unity except x=1 (when k=0, x=ω^0=1). Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term in the product is 1. Hmm, okay, but for all other k from 1 to 12, x is a primitive 13th root of unity.

So, the entire product is equal to 1 multiplied by the product over k=1 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2), where x = ω^k. So, the product is ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) with x being each primitive 13th root.

But wait, since for each k from 1 to 12, x = ω^k, and ω has order 13, then as k runs from 1 to 12, x runs over all the primitive 13th roots of unity. So, the product is the product over all
