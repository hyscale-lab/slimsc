Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

"A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list."

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I need to find such a list of positive integers that meets all three conditions, and then compute the sum of their squares.

First, let's recall what each term means.

- **Sum of the items**: That's straightforward, the total when you add all the numbers together is 30.
- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently. And it's a unique mode, so only 9 appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, especially if the list has an odd number of elements. So this might mean the list has an even number of elements, making the median an average of two numbers that aren't the same, resulting in a number not in the list.

Let me think about how to structure this list.

First, since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's denote the number of times 9 appears as 'k'. So, k must be greater than the frequency of any other number in the list.

Also, the sum is 30, so the sum of all the numbers is 30. Let me denote the list as L = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], sorted in non-decreasing order. So, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ ... ≤ an.

The median being a positive integer not in the list suggests that n (the number of elements) must be even. Because if n is odd, the median is the middle element, which would have to be in the list. But here, the median isn't in the list, so n must be even. Let's say n = 2m, so the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which is an integer but not present in the list.

Wait, but if the median is an integer, then (a_m + a_{m+1}) must be even, so their sum is even, meaning a_m and a_{m+1} are both even or both odd.

But the median is not in the list. So, for example, if a_m and a_{m+1} are both 8, the median would be 8, which is in the list. So that can't happen. Therefore, a_m and a_{m+1} must be different such that their average is an integer not present in the list.

Let me think of possible values for a_m and a_{m+1}.

Case 1: a_m = 7, a_{m+1} = 9. Then the median is (7+9)/2 = 8. But 8 isn't present in the list. Hmm, that's possible. Let's see.

Case 2: a_m = 8, a_{m+1}=10. Median is 9, but 9 is in the list as the mode. So that's not allowed because the median can't be in the list.

Case 3: a_m = 6, a_{m+1}=10. Then median is 8. Again, not in the list.

But let's go back to case 1: a_m=7, a_{m+1}=9. Then the median is 8, which is not in the list. So that's a possible scenario.

But wait, if the list has a_m=7 and a_{m+1}=9, then 7 comes before 9, so the numbers before a_m must be ≤7, and after, ≥9.

Given that 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. Let's consider how many times 9 appears.

Suppose 9 appears 3 times. Let's see if that's possible.

But before that, let me think about how the list is structured. Let me assume n is even, so n=2m. Let's choose a small n first to see if it's possible.

Wait, let's think about n: the total sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers. So the minimum possible sum for n elements is n (if all are 1). So n must be ≤30.

But to make the sum 30, with a mode of 9, which is relatively large, perhaps the list isn't too long. Let me think of possible n.

Wait, maybe n is 6 or 8? Let me see.

But let's try to structure the list.

Suppose n is 6. Then m=3, so the median is (a3 + a4)/2, which must be an integer not present in the list.

Let's try to make a3=7, a4=9, so median is 8, which is not in the list.

Then, the list is [a1, a2, 7, 9, a5, a6].

But 9 is the mode. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. So in this case, 9 appears at least twice? Or more?

Wait, let's think: the mode is 9, and it's unique. So no other number can appear as many times as 9.

If n=6, and 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice, but perhaps three times.

Wait, but if 9 appears three times, then in the list, the last three elements would be 9. So the positions a4, a5, a6 would be 9, 9, 9.

Wait, but then the list would be [a1, a2, 7, 9, 9, 9].

But then, a4=9, a5=9, a6=9.

Wait, but in this case, the median is (a3 + a4)/2 = (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is not in the list. That's good.

But now, let's check the sum: a1 + a2 + 7 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 30.

So sum so far: 7+9+9+9 = 34. Wait, that's already 34, but the total sum is 30. So that's a problem. So it's impossible for n=6 and 9 appearing three times because the sum would be too large.

So maybe n=6 is too small. Let me think of n=8.

Wait, n=8, so m=4. Then the median is (a4 + a5)/2.

Let me try to have a4=7 and a5=9, so median is 8, which is not in the list.

So the list would be [a1, a2, a3,7,9, a6, a7, a8].

Now, 9 is the mode, so it must appear more than any other number. Let's say 9 appears at least three times.

Wait, but in this case, a5=9, so if 9 appears three times, then maybe a5, a6, a7, a8 are 9s? Wait, no, because a5 is 9, but a6, a7, a8 can be 9s as well. Let's count:

Suppose 9 appears four times: a5, a6, a7, a8=9.

Then the list is [a1, a2, a3,7,9,9,9,9].

Sum so far: 7 + 4*9 = 7 + 36 = 43. But the total sum is 30, which is way too big. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, let's have 9 appear three times. So a5, a6, a7=9.

Wait, but if n=8, and a5=9, then a6, a7, a8 can be 9s. Let me try that.

Wait no, because if a5=9, then a6, a7, a8 must be ≥9. So if 9 is the mode, appearing three times, then perhaps a5, a6, a7=9, and a8= something else? But that would make 9 appear three times. Wait, but a5=9, a6=9, a7=9, a8 could be 9 as well, but that would make four 9s, which would make the sum too big.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears three times in the list. So let's see:

If a5=9, a6=9, a7=9, but a8= something else, say x.

So the list is [a1, a2, a3,7,9,9,9,x].

Now, the sum is a1 + a2 + a3 +7 +9+9+9+x = a1 + a2 + a3 + x + 34 =30.

So a1 +a2 +a3 +x = -4. Wait, that's impossible because all are positive integers. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps n=8 is too big, leading to a sum that's too large.

Wait, maybe n=5? Let's try n=5, which is odd. Then the median is the third element, a3. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So if n is odd, the median is a3, which would have to not be in the list, which is impossible because a3 is part of the list. So n must be even. So n must be even.

Wait, so n can't be odd because then the median would be an element in the list, which violates the condition. So n must be even. So n=6,8, etc.

Wait, but earlier with n=6, having three 9s gives a sum that's too high. So maybe 9 appears twice.

Wait, let's try n=6 again, but with 9 appearing twice.

So list is [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6].

To have the median as (a3 + a4)/2, which is an integer not in the list.

Let me try a3=8 and a4=8. Then the median is (8+8)/2=8, which is in the list. Not allowed.

So a3 and a4 must be different. Let me try a3=7, a4=9. Then median is 8, which is not in the list.

So the list is [a1, a2,7,9,a5,a6].

Now, 9 is the unique mode, so it must appear more times than any other number.

In this list, 9 appears at least twice. Let me say it appears three times. So a4=9, a5=9, a6=9.

Then the list is [a1, a2,7,9,9,9].

Sum so far: 7+9+9+9 =34, which is already 34, but the total sum is 30. So that's impossible.

So 9 can't appear three times here. So maybe 9 appears twice.

So list is [a1, a2,7,9, a5, a6], with a4=9 and a5 and a6 being ≥9. But if 9 is the mode, then 9 must appear more than any other number.

So if a1, a2,7 are all ≤7, but let's say a5 and a6 are 9s, making 9 appear three times. But that leads to sum exceeding.

Alternatively, perhaps a5 and a6 are higher than 9, but then 9 would only appear twice, which might not be sufficient as mode if other numbers appear twice as well.

Wait, let me try this again. Let me suppose 9 appears twice. Then, other numbers can appear at most once. Because if any other number appears twice, 9's count would need to be higher.

So, for example, in n=6, if 9 appears twice, then other numbers can appear at most once.

So let's structure the list as [a1, a2,7,9, a5, a6], with a5 and a6 being ≥9, but not 9.

Wait, but then 9 appears only twice, which is the same as a5 and a6 being, say, 10 each. So 9 appears twice, 10 appears twice. Then mode is not unique. So that's a problem.

Therefore, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So if 9 appears twice, other numbers can appear at most once.

So in n=6, let's have 9 appear twice, and other numbers appear once.

So the list would have six elements: two 9s, and four other distinct numbers.

Wait, but the sum would be 2*9 + sum of four other distinct positive integers.

So 2*9=18, so the sum of the other four numbers is 30-18=12.

So four distinct positive integers adding up to 12, each ≤7 because a3=7.

Wait, the numbers before a3=7 must be ≤7, and after a4=9, the numbers are ≥9. But in this case, a5 and a6 are after a4=9, so they have to be ≥9. But if a5 and a6 are ≥9, then they can't be part of the four numbers that sum to 12.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the four numbers before a3=7 (i.e., a1, a2, a3, and a4?) No, wait, the list is [a1, a2,7,9,a5,a6]. So a5 and a6 are after 9, so they must be ≥9. So a5 and a6 are ≥9, but they can't be part of the four numbers summing to 12 because those would be the first four elements.

Wait, no. Wait, if I have two 9s, then the other four elements must sum to 12, and each is ≤7.

So let's say the list is [a, b,7,9, c, d], where a ≤ b ≤7, c ≥9, d ≥9.

But the sum is a + b +7 +9 + c + d =30 → a + b + c +d =14.

But a, b ≤7, and c, d ≥9.

So a and b are positive integers ≤7, and c and d ≥9.

But 14 = a + b + c + d.

But c and d are at least 9 each, so c + d ≥18.

But a + b + c + d =14 → a + b =14 - (c + d) ≤14 -18= -4, which is impossible because a and b are positive integers. So this is not possible.

Therefore, n=6 with 9 appearing twice is impossible.

Hmm, maybe n=7? Wait, no, n must be even because the median is not in the list.

Wait, n=8: let's try that.

n=8, so m=4, median is (a4 + a5)/2, which must be an integer not in the list.

Let me try a4=8 and a5=8, but then the median is 8, which is in the list. Not allowed.

So a4 and a5 must be different.

Let me try a4=7 and a5=9, so median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Good.

So the list is [a1, a2, a3,7,9, a6, a7, a8].

Now, 9 must be the unique mode. So it must appear more times than any other number.

Let's say 9 appears three times: a5=9, a6=9, a7=9.

So the list is [a1, a2, a3,7,9,9,9,a8].

Now, the sum is a1 + a2 + a3 +7 +9+9+9 +a8 = a1+a2+a3 + a8 +34 =30.

So a1 +a2 +a3 +a8 =-4. That's impossible because all are positive integers. So 9 can't appear three times in this case.

So 9 must appear two times. Let's try that.

So 9 appears twice: a5=9, a6=9.

Wait, but then a6=9, a7 and a8 must be ≥9.

So the list is [a1, a2, a3,7,9,9, a7, a8].

Now, 9 appears twice. To make 9 the unique mode, no other number can appear twice.

So a1, a2, a3,7 must all appear once.

So the sum is a1 +a2 +a3 +7 +9+9 +a7 +a8 = a1+a2+a3 +a7 +a8 +25=30.

So a1 +a2 +a3 +a7 +a8 =5.

But a3 ≤7, and a7 and a8 are ≥9.

But a7 and a8 are at least 9 each, so a7 +a8 ≥18.

Thus, a1 +a2 +a3 +a7 +a8 ≥ a1 +a2 +1 +9 +9= a1+a2+19.

But 19 is already larger than 5, so that's impossible. So 9 can't appear twice either.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe n=10?

Wait, n=10 would have a larger sum, but let's see.

n=10: m=5, median is (a5 +a6)/2.

Let me set a5=8, a6=10. Then median is (8+10)/2=9, which is in the list as the mode. Not allowed.

Alternatively, a5=7, a6=9. Median is 8, which is not in the list.

So list is [a1, a2, a3, a4,7,9, a7, a8, a9, a10].

In this case, 9 is the mode, so it must appear more than any other number.

Let's say 9 appears three times: a6=9, a7=9, a8=9.

Then the list is [a1, a2, a3, a4,7,9,9,9, a9, a10].

Sum is a1+a2+a3+a4 +7 +9+9+9 +a9+a10 = a1+a2+a3+a4 +a9+a10 +34=30.

So a1+a2+a3+a4 +a9+a10 =-4. Impossible.

So 9 can't appear three times. Let's try two times.

List is [a1, a2, a3, a4,7,9, a7, a8, a9, a10].

9 appears twice: a6=9, a7=9.

But then a8, a9, a10 must be ≥9.

Sum is a1 +a2 +a3 +a4 +7 +9+9 +a8 +a9 +a10 = a1+a2+a3+a4 + a8+a9+a10 +25=30.

So a1+a2+a3+a4 +a8+a9+a10=5.

But a8, a9, a10 are ≥9, so their sum is at least 27 (if all are 9). But 27 >5, so impossible.

This approach doesn't seem to work. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the list has more 9s, but arranged such that the median isn't 9.

Wait, let's think of a list where 9 is the mode, appears, say, four times.

But then the median would have to be an average of two numbers that don't include 9, but 9 is the mode, so perhaps the list is structured with a lot of 9s but the median comes from lower numbers.

Alternatively, maybe the list is longer, with more numbers.

Wait, let me try n=12.

n=12, m=6. Median is (a6 + a7)/2.

Let me set a6=7, a7=9. Then median is 8, not in the list.

So list is [a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,7,9,a8,a9,a10,a11,a12].

Now, 9 must be the unique mode. Let's say 9 appears four times: a7, a8, a9, a10=9.

Wait, but then a8, a9, a10, a11, a12 are ≥9.

Sum of 9s: 4*9=36. But total sum is 30, which is less than 36. Impossible.

So 9 can't appear four times.

Alternatively, 9 appears three times: a7, a8, a9=9.

Sum of 9s:27. Then the rest: a1+a2+a3+a4+a5 +7 +a10+a11+a12=3.

But a10, a11, a12 are ≥9, so their sum is ≥27. So 3= a1+a2+a3+a4+a5 +7 +a10+a11+a12 ≥ a1+a2+a3+a4+a5 +7 +27= a1+...+a5 +34.

But 3= a1+...+a5 +34 → a1+...+a5= -31. Impossible.

This isn't working. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Perhaps I need to consider that the median is an integer not in the list, but the list could have numbers that average to that median without including it.

Wait, let's think of a list where the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, making the median 8, which isn't in the list.

So the list has to be even in length, and the two middle numbers are 7 and 9.

So for n=6, the list is [a1, a2,7,9,a5,a6].

Sum is a1 +a2 +7 +9 +a5 +a6=30 → a1+a2 +a5 +a6=14.

Now, the mode is 9, unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

In this case, 9 appears at least twice (a4=9 and a5=9 would make it three times). Wait, but a5 could be 9 or higher.

Wait, but if a5 is 9, then a6 must be ≥9.

So let's try 9 appearing three times: a4=9, a5=9, a6=9.

Then sum is a1+a2 +7 +9+9+9=30 → a1+a2 +7 +27=30 → a1+a2= -4. Impossible.

So 9 can't appear three times. So 9 appears twice: a4=9, and another 9 somewhere else.

Wait, but in the list [a1, a2,7,9,a5,a6], if 9 appears twice, then either a5=9 or a6=9.

If a5=9, then a6≥9.

So let's have a5=9 and a6=9. Then sum is a1+a2 +7 +9+9+9=30 → a1+a2= -4. Still impossible.

So 9 can't appear three times. So perhaps 9 appears only twice: a4=9 and a5=9, but then a6 could be something else.

Wait, but a6 has to be ≥9 because the list is sorted.

So a6=9 would make it three 9s, which we saw is impossible.

So maybe a6=10.

Then the list is [a1,a2,7,9,9,10].

Sum: a1 +a2 +7 +9+9+10=35 +a1+a2=30 → a1+a2= -5. Impossible.

Wait, maybe a4=9 and a5= something else.

Wait, no, because if a4=9, a5 must be ≥9.

Alternatively, perhaps a4=8 and a5=8, but then the median would be 8, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck with n=6.

Wait, maybe n=4.

n=4: median is (a2 +a3)/2.

Let me set a2=7, a3=9. Then median is (7+9)/2=8, not in the list.

So the list is [a1,7,9,a4].

Sum is a1 +7 +9 +a4=30 → a1 +a4=14.

Now, 9 is the mode, unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

In this list, 9 appears once (a3=9). So to make it the mode, it needs to appear more than any other number.

So a1 and a4 can't appear more than once each, but if a1 and a4 are the same, that would make them appear twice, which would tie with 9. So 9 must appear at least twice.

Wait, but in this list, 9 appears once. So if 9 appears twice, perhaps a4=9.

So list becomes [a1,7,9,9].

Sum is a1 +7 +9 +9=30 → a1=5.

So a1=5.

So the list is [5,7,9,9].

Check the conditions:

- Sum:5+7+9+9=30. Good.

- Mode:9 appears twice, others appear once. So mode is 9, unique. Good.

- Median: (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Good.

So this seems to satisfy all conditions.

Now, compute the sum of squares:5² +7² +9² +9²=25 +49 +81 +81=25+49=74; 74+81=155; 155+81=236.

Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, the list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum is 5+7+9+9=30. Correct.

Mode is 9, appearing twice. Others appear once. Correct.

Median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Correct.

So the sum of squares is 25 +49 +81 +81=25+49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.

Wait, but wait, in this case, n=4, and the list is correct. So the answer is 236.

But wait, earlier I thought n=6 was possible, but it seems n=4 works. So maybe that's the solution.


The list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions is [5, 7, 9, 9]. The sum of the squares of these numbers is 5² + 7² + 9² + 9² = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

$\boxed{236}$
