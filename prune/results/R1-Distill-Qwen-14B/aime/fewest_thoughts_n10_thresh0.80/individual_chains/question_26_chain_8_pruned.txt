Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and it's a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, and we need to find AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

First, I should visualize the problem. We have triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, it's a scalene triangle. Since it's inscribed in a circle, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole of BC, so D lies outside the circle ω.

Now, AD intersects ω again at P, so P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle. We need to find the length AP.

I remember that when dealing with tangents and secants, there are some theorems that might be useful here, like the Power of a Point theorem. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the length of the tangent from D to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points where a secant from D intersects the circle.

In this case, D is the point where the two tangents at B and C meet. So, the lengths of the tangents from D to ω are equal. Let's denote the length of DB and DC as t. Then, according to the Power of a Point theorem:

DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP

Wait, no, actually, the Power of a Point theorem for point D with respect to ω would say that DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe it's that DB^2 = DC^2 = DP * DA, but let's think about it.

Wait, no, the theorem states that for any secant from D intersecting the circle at two points, say X and Y, then DX * DY = DB^2, since DB is the tangent length. So in this case, AD is a secant intersecting ω at A and P. So, applying the theorem, we get:

DB^2 = DA * DP

Similarly, DC^2 = DA * DP.

Since DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω, they are equal in length. So, DB = DC = t, and t^2 = DA * DP.

That gives us one equation. But we need to find AP, which is DP - DA? Wait, actually, if AD intersects ω again at P, then AP is the length from A to P, which is part of AD. So, if we let AD = x, then DP would be the entire length from D to P, which is DA + AP? No, wait, if A is on the circle, then the secant from D passes through A and P. So, point A is on ω, so AD is a secant that starts at D, passes through A, and then goes to P on ω again. So, the Power of a Point theorem would say that DB^2 = DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. So, DP = DA + AP if P is beyond A, but wait, that can't be because P is the second intersection point. Wait, actually, no: in the circle, A is on the circle, so starting from D, the line DA goes from D, through A, and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the length DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which is DA + AP. So, the Power of a Point says DB^
