Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The graphs are given by the equations y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I should probably understand what the functions f(x) and g(x) look like. Let me write them down again:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

These are both absolute value functions with some transformations. I remember that absolute value functions create V-shaped graphs, and when you have absolute values of absolute values, it can create multiple segments or maybe even a W shape or something similar.

Let me start by analyzing f(x). So f(x) is | |x| - 1/2 |. Let's consider the inner part first: |x|. That's a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This would shift the graph down by 1/2 unit. But since it's inside another absolute value, we take the absolute value of that result. 

So, the graph of f(x) will have points where |x| - 1/2 is negative, and the absolute value will flip those parts above the x-axis. Let me think about the critical points where |x| - 1/2 = 0. That happens when |x| = 1/2, so at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So the original |x| - 1/2 graph would have a V-shape that is shifted down, crossing the x-axis at x = ±1/2. Then taking the absolute value of that would reflect any part below the x-axis to above.

So, for | |x| - 1/2 |, when |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. But when |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) has a W shape. Let me plot some points mentally:

- At x=0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- At x=1/2: f(1/2) = | |1/2| -1/2 | = |1/2 -1/2| = 0.
- At x=1: f(1) = |1 -1/2| = 1/2.
Similarly on the negative side.

So the graph is a W shape, symmetric about the y-axis, with minima at x=±1/2 and maxima at x=0, ±1, etc., each point f(x) = 1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Let me analyze g(x) the same way. The inner function is |x| - 1/4. So that's a V-shape shifted down by 1/4. The points where |x| -1/4 = 0 are at x=±1/4. So for |x| >=1/4, g(x) = |x| -1/4. For |x| <1/4, it's 1/4 - |x|.

So, g(x) is also a W-shaped graph, symmetric about the y-axis, with minima at x=±1/4, and maxima at x=0, ±1/2, etc.

Now, I need to consider f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me tackle them one by one.

First, let's consider f(sin(2πx)). Since sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1 (since the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k; here k=2π, so period is 1). The sine function ranges between -1 and 1. But since we're taking the absolute value inside f, let's note that |sin(2πx)| ranges between 0 and 1.

So, f(|sin(2πx)|) = || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, f is defined as ||x| -1/2|. So f(sin(2πx)) is || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Alternatively, since sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So f(sin(2πx)) is || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Let me denote t = |sin(2πx)|, so t is between 0 and 1. Then f(t) = | t - 1/2 |.

So, f(t) is a V-shape shifted down by 1/2, but since t is between 0 and 1, the graph of f(t) would be:

- For t < 1/2: f(t) = 1/2 - t.
- For t >=1/2: f(t) = t - 1/2.

So, the graph of f(sin(2πx)) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, because t = |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1, and f(t) maps t to |t - 1/2|, which ranges from 0 (at t=1/2) to 1/2 (at t=0 and t=1).

Wait, let me test some t values:

- t=0: f(t) = |0 -1/2| =1/2.
- t=1/2: f(t)=0.
- t=1: f(t)=|1 -1/2|=1/2.

So, as t goes from 0 to 1, f(t) goes from 1/2 down to 0 at t=1/2, then back up to 1/2 at t=1. So yes, the function f(sin(2πx)) is a wave that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with a peak at the points where |sin(2πx)| is 0 or 1, and a trough at |sin(2πx)|=1/2.

So, f(sin(2πx)) is a function that is periodic with period 1, oscillating between 0 and 1/2.

But since sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1, the composition f(sin(2πx)) will also have period 1.

Now, let's look at g(f(sin(2πx))). Remember, g(x) = ||x| -1/4|.

Let me denote s = f(sin(2πx)), so s ranges between 0 and 1/2. Then g(s) = | |s| -1/4 |.

But since s is non-negative (as it's an absolute value function), g(s) = |s - 1
