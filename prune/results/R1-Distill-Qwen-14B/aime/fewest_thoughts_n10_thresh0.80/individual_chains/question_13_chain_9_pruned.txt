Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya going for a walk every morning. Let me try to parse it carefully. 

So, Aya walks 9 kilometers each morning. She has two different walking speeds, and each time, she stops at a coffee shop for t minutes. The problem gives me two scenarios: one where she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, taking her 4 hours in total (including t minutes at the coffee shop), and another where she walks faster, at s + 2 km/h, taking her 2 hours and 24 minutes in total, again including t minutes in the coffee shop. 

The question is asking me to find the total time her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop. I need to find the number of minutes this takes.

Hmm. Okay, let's think about how to model this. It seems like a rate, time, distance problem. The formula I remember is distance = rate × time, or D = RT. 

In both scenarios, the distance is the same: 9 km. But the speed and time differ because of the different walking speeds. However, the time includes the coffee shop stop, which is the same t minutes in both cases. So, the time she spends walking is the total time minus t minutes.

Let me write down what I know:

1. First scenario: speed = s km/h, total time = 4 hours, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop. So, walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. But wait, times are in different units. Hmm, this could complicate things. Probably better to convert all times to the same unit, maybe minutes or hours. Let me decide.

Let me try to convert everything to hours because the speed is in km per hour. So, 4 hours is easy. For the second scenario, 2 hours and 24 minutes. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours.

Similarly, t minutes is t/60 hours. So, let's define:

In the first case:

Walking time = total time - coffee time = 4 hours - (t/60) hours.

But the walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed, which is 9 km / s km/h. So, 9/s hours.

So, equation one: 9/s = 4 - (t/60).

Similarly, in the second scenario:

Walking time = 2 hours 24 minutes - t minutes. Converting 2h24m to hours is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. So, walking time is 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

Walking time is also 9/(s + 2) hours.

So equation two: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60).

So now, I have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)

2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1, but maybe it's better to solve for t from one equation and substitute into the other. Let's see.

Let me denote equation 1 as:

9/s = 4 - (t/60) → t/60 = 4 - 9/s → t = 60*(4 - 9/s)

Similarly, equation 2:

9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60) → t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2) → t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s + 2))

Since both expressions equal t, I can set them equal to each other:

60*(4 - 9/s) = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s + 2))

I can divide both sides by 60 to simplify:

4 - 9/s = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

Now, let's rearrange this equation:

4 - 2.4 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

Let me compute the right-hand side:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 9*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 9*( (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) ) = 9*(2/(s(s + 2))) ) = 18/(s(s + 2))

So, 1.6 = 18/(s(s + 2))

Now, we can write:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Compute 18 divided by 1.6:

1.6 is 8/5, so 18 / (8/5) = 18 * (5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Let me expand the left side:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, solving this quadratic equation for s.

Quadratic equation: s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Using the quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=2, c= -11.25

Discriminant D = (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So sqrt(D)=7

Thus, s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:

s = (5)/2 = 2.5 km/h

s = (-9)/2 = -4.5 km/h

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Let's use equation 1:

t = 60*(4 - 9/s)

Compute 9/s: 9 / 2.5 = 3.6

So, 4 - 3.6 = 0.4

Thus, t = 60 * 0.4 = 24 minutes.

Alternatively, using equation 2:

t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s + 2))

s + 2 = 4.5 km/h

9 / 4.5 = 2

So, 2.4 - 2 = 0.4

t = 60 * 0.4 = 24 minutes. Same result. Good.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is: when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h, how much time does she take, including the coffee shop stop?

So, we need to find the total time when her speed is 3 km/h.

Again, using the formula: time = distance / speed.

Walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

But wait, that's the walking time. The total time is walking time plus coffee shop time, which is t =24 minutes.

So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, speed is 3 km/h, distance 9 km. Time is 9/3 = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then, add 24 minutes for coffee, so 204 minutes total.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I should compute the walking time in hours and then convert to minutes. Let me try that.

Walking time: 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 * 60 =
