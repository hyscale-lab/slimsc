Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits so that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999. The second condition is that when I read the numbers top to bottom, their sum is 99. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are 2 rows and 3 columns. Each cell will contain a single digit, right? So each cell can be from 0 to 9. Now, when I read the grid left to right, that means the top row forms a three-digit number, and the bottom row also forms a three-digit number. Their sum should be 999. 

Similarly, when I read the grid top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. There are three columns, so three two-digit numbers, and their sum should be 99. 

Let me represent the grid with variables to make it easier. Let's say the grid looks like this:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, the top row is the number "abc", which is 100a + 10b + c. The bottom row is "def", which is 100d + 10e + f. The sum of these two numbers is 999:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Simplify that equation: 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Hmm, okay, and the other condition is that the sum of the three two-digit column numbers is 99. Each column is "ad", "be", "cf". So:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Simplify that: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So now I have two equations:

1) 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

2) 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Hmm, maybe I can denote some variables to make this easier. Let me call S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f. Then the first equation becomes 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Similarly, let me denote T1 = a + b + c, T2 = d + e + f. Then the second equation is 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

Wait, but from the first equation, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999. Since 999 is a three-digit number, let's think about how 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 can be 999.

But wait, S1, S2, S3 are sums of digits, so each of a, d is a digit (0-9), similarly others. So S1 = a + d can be at most 9 + 9 = 18. Similarly, S2 can be up to 18, and S3 up to 18.

But let's see: 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999. So, 100*S1 has to be less than or equal to 999. So S1 can be 9 at maximum because 100*10=1000 which is over 999. So S1 can be from 0 to 9, but since 100*S1 is part of 999, S1 must be 9 because 100*S1 would be 900, which is the highest multiple of 100 less than 999.

So from equation 1, S1 must be 9. So 100*9 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999 → 900 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999. So 10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Wait, that's interesting because the second equation is 10*T1 + T2 = 99. So from equation 1, after substituting S1=9, we get 10*S2 + S3 = 99. And from equation 2, we have 10*T1 + T2 = 99. So both 10*S2 + S3 and 10*T1 + T2 equal 99. Hmm, but what do S2, S3, T1, and T2 represent?

Wait, S2 is b + e, and S3 is c + f. T1 is a + b + c, and T2 is d + e + f.

Wait, but S1 is a + d =9.

So, from equation 1, 10*S2 + S3 =99.

From equation 2, 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

Wait, but note that a + d =9, so d=9 -a.

Similarly, let's see if we can express T2 in terms of T1 and S1.

T2 = d + e + f = (9 - a) + e + f.

But S3 = c + f.

Also, S2 = b + e.

So, let's express T2: (9 - a) + (S2 - b) + f = 9 -a + S2 - b + f. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of variables. Let's try to express T1 and T2 in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, T1 = a + b + c.

We know that S1 = a + d =9, so d=9 -a.

Similarly, S2 = b + e → e = S2 - b.

S3 = c + f → f = S3 - c.

So, T2 = d + e + f = (9 -a) + (S2 - b) + (S3 - c) = 9 -a + S2 - b + S3 - c.

But T1 = a + b + c.

So, T2 = 9 - T1 + S2 + S3 - 2c - 2b? Hmm, maybe not. Let me compute it step by step.

Wait, T2 = d + e + f.

We know d =9 -a, e = S2 - b, f = S3 - c.

So T2 = (9 -a) + (S2 - b) + (S3 - c) = 9 -a + S2 - b + S3 - c.

So, T2 = 9 + S2 + S3 - (a + b + c).

But a + b + c is T1, so T2 = 9 + S2 + S3 - T1.

From equation 2: 10*T1 + T2 =99.

Substitute T2:

10*T1 + (9 + S2 + S3 - T1) =99.

Simplify:

10*T1 - T1 + 9 + S2 + S3 =99.

So, 9*T1 +9 + S2 + S3 =99.

Subtract 9:

9*T1 + S2 + S3 =90.

But from equation 1, after substitution, we have 10*S2 + S3 =99.

So, let's denote equation 3: 10*S2 + S3 =99.

And equation 4: 9*T1 + S2 + S3 =90.

Hmm, equations 3 and 4.

From equation 3: S3 =99 -10*S2.

Substituting into equation 4:

9*T1 + S2 + (99 -10*S2) =90.

Simplify:

9*T1 + S2 +99 -10*S2 =90.

Combine like terms:

9*T1 -9*S2 +99 =90.

Subtract 99:

9*T1 -9*S2 = -9.

Divide both sides by 9:

T1 - S2 = -1 → T1 = S2 -1.

So, T1 = S2 -1.

But T1 is a + b + c, and S2 is b + e.

But e is S2 - b, from earlier.

Hmm, so T1 = a + b + c = S2 -1.

Wait, let me write that down:

a + b + c = S2 -1.

But S2 = b + e.

So, a + b + c = (b + e) -1 → a + c = e -1.

So, e = a + c +1.

Hmm, interesting. That's a relationship between e and a, c.

I think I need to find all possible values of S2 and S3 that satisfy 10*S2 + S3 =99, and then for each of those, find the possible ways to assign the digits a, b, c, d, e, f such that all the constraints are met.

So, let's first find possible S2 and S3.

From 10*S2 + S3 =99.

Since S2 and S3 are sums of digits, they can be between 0 and 18.

But 10*S2 + S3 =99.

So, possible S2 values are from 0 to 9, since 10*10=100>99.

So, S2 can be 0 to 9.

For each S2, S3=99-10*S2.

But S3 has to be ≥0 and ≤18.

So, let's check which S2 values make S3 valid.

Let me compute S3 for S2=0: 99 → 99, which is more than 18. So invalid.

S2=1: S3=89 → also invalid.

S2=2: 79 → invalid.

S2=3: 69 → invalid.

S2=4:59 → invalid.

S2=5:49→ invalid.

S2=6:39→ invalid.

S2=7:29→ invalid.

S2=8:19→ invalid.

S2=9:9 → S3=99-90=9, which is valid.

Wait, wait a second. So only when S2=9, S3=9 is valid.

Wait, really? Because for S2=9, S3=9. For S2=8, S3=19, which is more than 18, which is the maximum possible sum (9+9=18). So, S2 can only be 9, leading to S3=9.

Hmm, so S2=9 and S3=9.

So, that simplifies things.

So, S2=9, S3=9.

So from equation 1, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, now, let me recap:

S1 = a + d =9.

S2 = b + e =9.

S3 = c + f =9.

Also, from equation 2, 10*T1 + T2=99.

But T1 = a + b + c.

T2 = d + e + f.

But since S1=9, d=9 - a.

Similarly, e=9 - b, f=9 - c.

So, T2 = d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 - b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - T1.

So, equation 2: 10*T1 + (27 - T1) =99.

Simplify:

10*T1 +27 - T1 =99 → 9*T1 +27=99 → 9*T1=72 → T1=8.

So, T1=8.

But T1 = a + b + c =8.

Earlier, we had from T1 = S2 -1, and S2=9, so T1=8, which matches.

So, now, let's summarize the conditions:

a + d =9.

b + e =9.

c + f =9.

Also, a + b + c =8.

But since d =9 - a, e=9 - b, f=9 - c.

So, all the variables are related.

Moreover, a, b, c are digits, so each can be from 0 to9, but with a + b + c=8.

Also, since d=9 -a, d must be a digit, so a can be 0 to9, but since d=9 -a, which must also be a digit (0-9), which it is for a=0 to9.

Same for e and f.

Now, our variables are a, b, c.

Constraints:

1. a + b + c =8.

2. a, b, c are digits (0-9).

3. Additionally, since e=9 -b, and f=9 -c, we need to ensure that e and f are non-negative and ≤9, which they are because b and c are between 0 and9.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, with a, b, c each between 0 and9.

But since 8 is less than 3*9=27, and each of a, b, c is at most 9, the constraints are automatically satisfied because the sum is only 8. So, we don't have to worry about any variable exceeding 9. So, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, which is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2)=45.

Wait, but is that the case? Because in stars and bars, the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8 is indeed (8 +3-1) choose (3-1)=10 choose 2=45.

But wait, in our case, a, b, c are digits, so each can be 0-9, but since 8 is less than 9, all variables will naturally be within 0-8, which is within 0-9, so no problem. So, the total number of solutions is 45.

But wait, wait. Are there any other constraints?

Because when you set a, b, c, you also set d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

But d, e, f must each be digits (0-9). Since a, b, c are digits, d=9 -a is between 0 and9, same with e and f.

So, no additional constraints beyond a + b + c=8 and a, b, c ≥0.

Therefore, the number of possible triplets (a, b, c) is 45.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that the case? Or are there any other constraints?

Wait, the original problem is about a 2x3 grid. Each cell is a digit.

In the given example, the top row is 0 0 8, and the bottom row is 9 9 1. So, the grid is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

Which satisfies the conditions.

But in our analysis, a, b, c can be from 0-9, and the same for d, e, f.

So, if a, b, c are determined, d, e, f are determined as 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c.

So, each triplet (a, b, c) corresponds to exactly one grid.

But wait, in the initial problem statement, it's a grid, so each digit is a single digit (0-9). So, as long as a, b, c are digits, and d, e, f are digits, which they are, as we saw.

Therefore, the number of grids is the same as the number of triplets (a, b, c) satisfying a + b + c=8, which is 45.

Wait, hold on. But wait, in the example given, a=0, b=0, c=8. So, that's one of the 45 possible triplets.

But wait, is that the only condition? Or are there other constraints?

Wait, let me double-check.

The two conditions are:

- The sum of the two three-digit numbers is 999.

- The sum of the three two-digit numbers is 99.

In our analysis, we found that S1=9, S2=9, S3=9, and T1=8, T2=27 - T1=19.

Wait, T1=8, T2=19.

So, 10*8 +19=80 +19=99, which is correct.

But let me check if all the constraints are satisfied.

When a + b + c=8, and d + e + f=19.

But d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

So, d + e + f=27 - (a + b + c)=27 -8=19, which is correct.

So, yes, all the required conditions are satisfied.

Therefore, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of possible triplets (a, b, c) where a, b, c are digits, and a + b + c=8.

Which is C(10, 2)=45.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think if there's another constraint.

Because in the problem statement, the grid is 2x3. So, each of the two three-digit numbers must be a three-digit number. That means the first digit of each row cannot be zero, right? Because otherwise, it would be a two-digit number.

Wait, in the example, the top row is 0 0 8, which is 008. But 008 is just 8, a single-digit number. Similarly, the bottom row is 991. So, the sum is 8 +991=999.

But in that case, the top row is treated as a three-digit number with leading zeros, which is allowed in the problem statement because it's a grid of digits. So, 008 is acceptable as a three-digit number, even though it's numerically equal to 8.

So, does the problem allow leading zeros? The example includes leading zeros, so yes, it's allowed.

Therefore, the first digit of each row can be zero, so all triplets (a, b, c) where a, b, c are digits (including zero) and a + b + c=8 are acceptable.

Therefore, the number of such triplets is 45.

But wait, before I conclude, let me make sure I didn't miss any constraints. For example, in the example given, a=0, b=0, c=8. So, a is zero, which is allowed. Similarly, in other triplets, a, b, c can be zero. So, 45 is the correct count.

But let me think: 45 is the number of solutions to a + b + c=8, where a, b, c are non-negative integers. Each of a, b, c can be from 0 to8, but since 8 is less than 9, they're all digits.

So, yeah, 45 seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. What about the conditions on the column sums? Because in the columns, each column is a two-digit number, and their sum is 99.

But in our analysis, we already considered that condition, which led us to T1=8 and T2=19.

Which, in turn, led us to a + b + c=8 and d + e + f=19.

But d, e, f are 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c.

So, as long as a + b + c=8, all conditions are satisfied.

Therefore, I think 45 is the correct number of grids.

Hmm, but let me think again. In the example given, a=0, b=0, c=8. So, e=9 -b=9, f=9 -c=1.

So, d=9 -a=9. So, the grid is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

Which works. So, that's one possible grid.

Another example: a=1, b=2, c=5. Then d=8, e=7, f=4.

So, the grid would be:

1 2 5

8 7 4

Check the sum of the two rows: 125 +874=999. Correct.

Sum of the columns:

18 (1 and8), 27 (2 and7),54 (5 and4). 18 +27=45; 45 +54=99. Correct.

So, that also works.

Another example: a=8, b=0, c=0. Then d=1, e=9, f=9.

Grid:

8 0 0

1 9 9

Sum of rows: 800 +199=999. Correct.

Sum of columns:81 +09 +09= 81 +9 +9=99. Correct.

So, that works too.

So, seems like each triplet (a,b,c) with a + b + c=8 gives a valid grid.

Hence, the number of such grids is 45.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions. The grid must satisfy two constraints:

1. The sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999.
2. The sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99.

Representing the grid as:

```
a b c
d e f
```

We derive two key equations:

1. The sum of the row numbers:
   \[
   100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
   \]
   Let \( S_1 = a + d \), \( S_2 = b + e \), and \( S_3 = c + f \). Then:
   \[
   100S_1 + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999
   \]
   Since \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are sums of digits, \( S_1 \) must be 9 (as \( 100 \times 9 = 900 \), the largest multiple of 100 less than 999). This gives:
   \[
   10S_2 + S_3 = 99
   \]
   The only valid solution is \( S_2 = 9 \) and \( S_3 = 9 \).

2. The sum of the column numbers:
   \[
   10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
   \]
   Let \( T_1 = a + b + c \) and \( T_2 = d + e + f \). Then:
   \[
   10T_1 + T_2 = 99
   \]
   Substituting \( d = 9 - a \), \( e = 9 - b \), and \( f = 9 - c \), we find:
   \[
   T_2 = 27 - T_1
   \]
   Substituting into the equation:
   \[
   10T_1 + (27 - T_1) = 99 \implies 9T_1 + 27 = 99 \implies T_1 = 8
   \]
   Thus, \( a + b + c = 8 \).

The problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( a + b + c = 8 \), where \( a, b, c \) are digits (0-9). Using the stars and bars method, the number of solutions is:
\[
\binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
\]

Thus, there are 45 valid ways to fill the grid.

\boxed{45}
