Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me see if I can figure this out. It's a bit confusing, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, so there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is kind of a given. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Wait, so each person owns at least the candy hearts, but they might own none, some, or all of the other three. The problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of the things (excluding candy hearts?), and 234 own exactly three. We're supposed to find how many own all four—so that would include candy hearts and the three other items, right?

Hmm, I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles in set theory. Maybe I can use that here. Let me recall. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding up the individual sets, subtracting the pairwise intersections, adding back the triple-wise intersections, and so on.

But wait, in this case, it's a bit different because each resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are like a base set, and the other items are additional. But actually, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but the other items are optional. So, the total number of people is 900, and each owns at least one item—probably the candy hearts.

Wait, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the candy hearts are owned by everyone. The other three items—diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades—are owned by some subset of these 900.

So, the problem is about the overlap between these three items, with some people owning two, some owning three, and we need to find how many own all four. But since everyone owns the candy hearts, owning all four would mean owning all three of the other items plus the candy hearts.

Wait, no. Actually, the candy hearts are a separate thing. So, when it says "each resident owns a bag of candy hearts," it's a given. The other three are separate. So, the four items are: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade.

But the problem doesn't mention anything about people owning all four except through the information given. Hmm. So, the question is about how many people own all four items: candy hearts, diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.

Wait, but the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, all 900 have the candy hearts. Then, the other three items—diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades—are owned by some number of people. So, the problem is about the overlap of these three, considering the candy hearts as a universal set.

Wait, but the question is about the number of people who own all four. Since the candy hearts are already owned by everyone, the number of people who own all four is exactly the number of people who own all three other items: diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.

Wait, but the problem also says that 437 own exactly two of the things, and 234 own exactly three. Does that include the candy hearts? Hmm, the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, when it says 437 own exactly two, does that mean exactly two of the other three, or exactly two including the candy hearts?

Wait, the problem states: "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." The "these things" must refer to the four items, including candy hearts. Because it says "each of the
