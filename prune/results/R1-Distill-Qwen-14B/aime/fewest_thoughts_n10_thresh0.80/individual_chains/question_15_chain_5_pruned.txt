Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, let me visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid, so it's like a chessboard with 8 rows and 8 columns. The path starts from the lower left, which I can consider as (0,0), and ends at the upper right, which is (8,8). The path moves along the grid lines, so each step is either right or up.

Wait, but the problem says the paths have a length of 16. Since it's an 8x8 grid, moving from one corner to the other requires moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So that makes sense.

Each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. But the problem isn't just about any path; it's about paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, so how does changing direction work?

In a path, the direction changes when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. So, for example, a path that goes all the way right first, then all the way up is just one direction change. Similarly, a path that alternates right and up every step changes direction every time, so it would have 15 direction changes, which is probably more than four.

So, the number of direction changes is the number of times the path switches from R to U or U to R. Since the path starts with either R or U, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. Wait, let's think about that.

Suppose the path is made up of segments where each segment is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. Each time the direction changes, a new segment starts. So, if there are k direction changes, the path is made of (k+1) segments. For example, no direction changes (k=0) would mean the entire path is one segment, either all R's followed by all U's or vice versa.

So, if the path has four direction changes, it must consist of five segments. Each segment is either a run of R's or U's. Now, each segment alternates direction. So, the first segment could be R, then U, then R, then U, etc., or it could start with U and alternate.

Wait, but the starting direction is either R or U. So, depending on that, the sequence of segments will be R, U, R, U, ... or U, R, U, R, ... So, for five segments, if it starts with R, the directions would be R, U, R, U, R. Similarly, starting with U would be U, R, U, R, U.

Wait, but since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), the total number of R steps is 8, and the total number of U steps is 8. So, the sum of all R segments must be 8, and the sum of all U segments must be 8.

So, for five segments, if the path starts with R, the sequence of directions is R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments. Each R segment contributes some number of steps, and similarly for U segments.

Similarly, if the path starts with U, the directions would be U, R, U, R, U, so three U segments and two R segments.

But wait, in both cases, the number of segments is five. So, regardless of starting direction, the number of segments is the same, but the number of R and U segments depends on starting direction.

Wait, let me think again. If the number of direction changes is four, that implies five segments. So, if the first segment is R, the segments alternate R, U, R, U, R (total segments: 5). So, 3 R segments and 2 U segments. Similarly, if starting with U, 3 U segments and 2 R segments.

But since the total R steps are 8 and U steps are 8, in both cases, the sum of the R segments is 8, and the sum of the U segments is 8.

So, perhaps I can model this as a composition problem. For the case where the path starts with R, we have three R segments and two U segments. Each R segment must be at least 1 step, and each U segment must be at least 1 step as well. Because you can't have a segment of length zero; a direction change implies a switch, so the previous segment must have at least one step.

Wait, is that right? Because if a direction changes, the previous segment must have at least one step. So, for example, you can't have a segment of zero steps. So, each of the R segments (if starting with R) must be at least 1, same with U segments.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts for R segments and 8 into 2 parts for U segments (if starting with R). Similarly, if starting with U, it's compositions of 8 into 3 parts for U segments and 8 into 2 parts for R segments.

So, the number of such paths would be the number of compositions for R's times the number of compositions for U's, considering both starting with R and starting with U.

Wait, let me formalize that.

Case 1: The path starts with R.

Number of R segments: 3 (since starting with R and five segments total, so R, U, R, U, R)
Number of U segments: 2

We need to find the number of ways to write 8 as the sum of three positive integers (for R segments) and 8 as the sum of two positive integers (for U segments).

The number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts is equal to C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, the number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7.

So, for this case, the number of paths starting with R is 21 * 7 = 147.

Case 2: The path starts with U.

Number of U segments: 3
Number of R segments: 2

Similarly, the number of compositions for U segments is C(7,2)=21, and for R segments, it's C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of paths starting with U is also 21 *7=147.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but hold on. Is that the correct approach? Let me double-check.

Each composition corresponds to the lengths of each segment. For starting with R, each R segment is at least 1, and each U segment is at least 1. So, for 8 R steps divided into 3 segments, it's C(7,2), and 8 U steps divided into 2 segments is C(7,1).

Multiplying these gives the number of ways for the R and U segments when starting with R, and similarly for starting with U.

So, adding both cases gives the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, but wait, let's think again: the number of direction changes is four, which gives five segments. So, for each starting direction, the number of segments is split into R and U.

If starting with R, the segments are R, U, R, U, R: that's three R's and two U's.

Similarly, starting with U, it's three U's and two R's.

So, the number of compositions is as I calculated: (compositions of 8 into 3 parts) * (compositions of 8 into 2 parts), and same for starting with U.

So, 21 *7=147 for each case, summing to 294. That seems correct.

But wait, another angle: the number of direction changes is four, which can be thought of as the number of times the path switches from R to U or U to R. So, for each path, the number of direction changes is equal to one less than the number of segments. So, four changes imply five segments.

Each path is a sequence of five segments, alternating between R and U. So, the number of such paths is 2 * (number of compositions for starting with R).

Wait, but why 2? Because starting with R or starting with U are two different cases. So, for each case, the number of compositions is (compositions of 8 into 3 parts) * (compositions of 8 into
