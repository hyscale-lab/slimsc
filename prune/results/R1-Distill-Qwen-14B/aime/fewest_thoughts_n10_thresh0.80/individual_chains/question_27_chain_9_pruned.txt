Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, when you spin that circle around the axis, it creates this donut-shaped surface.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says the torus rests on the inside of the sphere and is internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Then, when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I should probably recall some properties of tori and spheres.

The torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this problem, R is 6 and r is 3.

So, the surface of the torus is given by the equation in cylindrical coordinates (since it's symmetric around the axis). The standard equation for a torus is:

\[ (R - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 + z^2 = r^2 \]

But maybe I can think about this in terms of spheres. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. These circles are the points where the two surfaces just touch each other.

So, let me consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere. The sphere has radius 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

The torus is inside the sphere, so they touch along a circle. Let's try to find the radius of this circle as seen from the center of the sphere.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so maybe I should model the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus. Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the points where the torus and sphere are tangent.

Let me model the torus as being centered at the origin as well, just like the sphere. So, the torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, and the center of this circle is at (6, 0, 0), right? Because the major radius R is 6, so the center is 6 units away from the axis (the z-axis).

Wait, no. Actually, the torus is centered at the origin if we consider that the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0) and the axis is the z-axis. No, wait, maybe not. If the generating circle is in the plane of the axis, which is the z-axis, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6, then the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0). So, the torus is a surface where each point is the result of rotating that circle around the z-axis.

But the sphere is centered at the origin as well. So, the sphere has equation x² + y² + z² = 11².

When the torus is inside the sphere, the points of tangency are along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the tangency is along another circle. So, I need to find the radii of these circles.

Let me think about the points where the torus and sphere are tangent. At these points, both surfaces share a common tangent plane, so their normals must be colinear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the
