Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let's try to unpack what a b-eautiful number is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. So n must be between b^1 and b^2 - 1 in decimal, right? Because in base b, the first digit is the b's place and the second is the units place. So the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So if the two digits are a and c (where a is the first digit and c is the second digit in base b), then a + c = sqrt(n). Also, since it's a two-digit number in base b, a must be between 1 and b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.

So, putting this together, n in base b is written as (a)(c)_b, which is equal to a*b + c. And we have the condition that a + c = sqrt(n). So substituting n, we get a + c = sqrt(a*b + c).

Let me write that down:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange the equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can group terms:

a^2 - a*b + 2ac + c^2 - c = 0

Not sure if that helps. Maybe factor out a from the first two terms and c from the next two:

a(a - b) + c(2a + c - 1) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps either. Maybe another approach.

Let me think about possible values of a and c. Since a is from 1 to b-1 and c is from 0 to b-1, perhaps I can express n in two ways:

n = a*b + c = (a + c)^2

So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me solve for b:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Simplify the numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c(c - 1)

So, b = [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c] / a = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

But since b must be an integer (base is an integer), the term (c^2 - c)/a must also be an integer because the other terms are integers. So (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

Let me write that as:

(c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. So a divides (c^2 - c). So a | c(c - 1). That's an interesting condition.

So for given a and c, we have that a divides c(c - 1). Also, since a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1, perhaps for each base b, I can find possible a and c that satisfy these conditions.

But since b is expressed in terms of a and c, perhaps it's better to consider a and c as variables and find all possible b that can be formed as above, then for each b, count how many (a,c) pairs satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimal b such that the number of b-eautiful integers is more than ten. So perhaps I need to find, for each b starting from 2 upwards, how many n satisfy the two-digit condition and the sum of digits equals sqrt(n). Once I find the first b where the count exceeds 10, that's my answer.

But this might be time-consuming, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula or a way to count the number of solutions for each b.

Let me try to re-express the equation.

We have n = (a + c)^2 and n = a*b + c.

So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me write this as:

b = (a + c)^2 - c / a

As before.

So, b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

Which simplifies to:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a, as I noted before.

So, a must be a divisor of c(c - 1).

But since a and c are positive integers (a from 1 to b-1, c from 0 to b-1), perhaps I can find possible a and c such that a divides c(c-1).

But let's think about this. For each a, c must be such that c(c-1) is a multiple of a.

Alternatively, for each c, a must divide c(c-1). Hmm.

Wait, but c can be zero. If c is zero, then c(c-1) = 0*(-1) = 0, so a divides 0, which is always true, as any a>0 divides 0.

So when c=0, then b = [a^2 + 2a*0 + 0^2 - 0]/a = a^2 / a = a.

So b = a.

But since a is between 1 and b-1, and b = a, that would require a < a, which is impossible. So c=0 is not allowed because it would lead to b=a, which is invalid since a must be less than b.

Therefore, c must be at least 1.

Wait, if c=0, then n would be a* b + 0, and the sum a + 0 = a, which should equal sqrt(n) = sqrt(a b). So sqrt(a b) = a, which means a^2 = a b => b = a. But then a = b, which is invalid because a must be less than b. So c=0 is invalid. So c must be at least 1.

Similarly, c can be up to b-1, but since a must be at least 1, and c must be at least 1, let's see.

So, given that, c is from 1 to b-1, and a is from 1 to b-1, and a divides c(c-1).

So for given b, we can iterate over possible a and c to find the number of solutions.

But perhaps another approach is better. Since n = (a + c)^2, and n must be a two-digit number in base b, which is n >= b and n <= b^2 - 1.

So, (a + c)^2 >= b and (a + c)^2 <= b^2 - 1.

But n = (a + c)^2 = a*b + c. So:

(a + c)^2 >= b => a + c >= sqrt(b)

and

(a + c)^2 <= b^2 - 1 => a + c <= sqrt(b^2 - 1) â‰ˆ b - 1/(2b) for large b, so approximately a + c <= b - 1.

But since a + c is an integer, a + c <= b -1.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe let's consider that:

n = (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me write this as:

(a + c)^2 - c = a*b

So, a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

Which can be written as:

a*b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

Which simplifies to:

a*b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

So, b = [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c] / a

As before.

Hmm. Maybe I can express this as:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. So a divides c(c - 1).

So, for each a, c must satisfy that a divides c(c - 1). Also, since a is at least 1 and c is at least 1, perhaps I can think about possible a's and c's such that this is true.

Additionally, since n = (a + c)^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which is between b and b^2 - 1.

So, n >= b and n <= b^2 -1.

Which implies that (a + c)^2 >= b and (a + c)^2 <= b^2 -1.

But since n = a*b + c, and n = (a + c)^2, we can write:

(a + c)^2 = a b + c

So, for each possible a and c, we can compute b as:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

And then check if b is an integer and whether a and c are valid digits in base b (i.e., a < b and c < b).

So, perhaps the approach is:

1. For each possible a and c, compute b as above.

2. Ensure that a < b and c < b.

3. Then, for each base b, count how many (a,c) pairs satisfy this.

4. Find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can fix a and c and compute b, then check if a and c are valid for that b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible a and c, compute b, and then collect all possible b's and their corresponding counts.

But since I need to find the minimal b with more than ten solutions, maybe I can find a way to count the number of (a,c) pairs for each b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between a and c for a given b.

Wait, given that a divides c(c - 1), perhaps for each b, I can find the number of pairs (a,c) such that:

- a is from 1 to b-1

- c is from 1 to b-1

- a divides c(c - 1)

And also, when we compute b from a and c, it must equal [(a + c)^2 - c]/a.

Wait, that might not necessarily be the case because when we fix a and c, we can compute b, but b must be consistent with the digits a and c. So, for a given a and c, the computed b must be such that a < b and c < b.

So, perhaps the way to do this is:

For a given b, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to
