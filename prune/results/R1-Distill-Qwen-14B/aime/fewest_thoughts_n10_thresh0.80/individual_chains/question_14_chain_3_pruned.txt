Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. I'm looking for the largest four-digit number N. So N is between 9999 and 1000. And the key property is that if any single digit of N is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So changing the thousands digit to 1, the hundreds digit to 1, the tens digit to 1, or the units digit to 1, in each case, the resulting number should be a multiple of 7.

This seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down. Since N is a four-digit number, let's denote its digits as a, b, c, d, where a is the thousands digit, b the hundreds, c the tens, and d the units. So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Now, if we change any one digit to 1, the new number N' must be divisible by 7. So for each digit position, changing it to 1 should give a number divisible by 7.

Let me list the four possibilities:

1. Changing a to 1: The new number is 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing b to 1: The new number is 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing c to 1: The new number is 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. This must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing d to 1: The new number is 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. This must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

I think the key here is to write down these four conditions and see what constraints they impose on a, b, c, d.

Let me write N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Then, when we change a single digit to 1, the new number can be expressed in terms of N. Let me see:

1. Changing a to 1: (N - a*1000) + 1000*1 = N - a*1000 + 1000. So, N - a*1000 + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which simplifies to: N + (1 - a)*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, for changing b to 1: N - b*100 + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N + (1 - b)*100 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Changing c to 1: N - c*10 + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N + (1 - c)*10 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Changing d to 1: N - d + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N + (1 - d) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So now, I can write these four congruence relations:

1. N + (1 - a)*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N + (1 - b)*100 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N + (1 - c)*10 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N + (1 - d) ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me denote these as equations (1) to (4) respectively.

Since all these are congruent to 0 mod 7, that means N must satisfy each of these conditions.

Alternatively, let's rearrange each equation to express N in terms of the other variables.

From equation (1):

N ≡ - (1 - a)*1000 mod 7

Similarly,

N ≡ - (1 - b)*100 mod 7

N ≡ - (1 - c)*10 mod 7

N ≡ - (1 - d) mod 7

So, all four expressions must be congruent to N modulo 7. Therefore, they must be congruent to each other modulo 7.

So, let me compute each coefficient modulo 7 because 1000, 100, 10, and 1 have different mod 7 values.

Compute 1000 mod 7: Let's see, 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, because 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So,

Equation (1): N ≡ - (1 - a)*6 mod 7

Equation (2): N ≡ - (1 - b)*2 mod 7

Equation (3): N ≡ - (1 - c)*3 mod 7

Equation (4): N ≡ - (1 - d)*1 mod 7

Since all four expressions equal N mod 7, they must equal each other.

So, set equation (1) equal to equation (2):

- (1 - a)*6 ≡ - (1 - b)*2 mod 7

Multiply both sides by -1:

(1 - a)*6 ≡ (1 - b)*2 mod 7

Let me write this as:

6(1 - a) ≡ 2(1 - b) mod 7

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, this is allowed):

3(1 - a) ≡ (1 - b) mod 7

Similarly, let me write equation (1) equal to equation (3):

6(1 - a) ≡ 3(1 - c) mod 7

Divide both sides by 3:

2(1 - a) ≡ (1 - c) mod 7

Equation (1) equal to equation (4):

6(1 - a) ≡ (1 - d) mod 7

So, now I have a set of congruences:

1. 3(1 - a) ≡ (1 - b) mod 7
2. 2(1 - a) ≡ (1 - c) mod 7
3. 6(1 - a) ≡ (1 - d) mod 7

Similarly, I can express each of b, c, d in terms of a.

Let me denote x = 1 - a. Then:

From 1: 3x ≡ (1 - b) mod 7 => 1 - b ≡ 3x mod 7 => b ≡ 1 - 3x mod 7

From 2: 2x ≡ (1 - c) mod 7 => c ≡ 1 - 2x mod 7

From 3: 6x ≡ (1 - d) mod 7 => d ≡ 1 - 6x mod 7

But x = 1 - a, so x = 1 - a mod 7.

But since a is a digit (0-9, but since N is four-digit, a is 1-9), but in modulo 7, a can be considered as a mod 7.

Wait, but a is a digit, so a is between 1
