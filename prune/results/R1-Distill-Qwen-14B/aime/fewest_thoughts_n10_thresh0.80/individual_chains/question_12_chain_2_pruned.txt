Alright, so I've got this problem here about filling a 2x3 grid with digits. The goal is to make sure that when you read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999, and when you read them top to bottom, their sum is 99. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. Each cell will have a single digit (0-9, I assume). So, the first row will form a three-digit number, and the second row will form another three-digit number. When you add these two numbers together, you should get 999. That's one condition.

Then, for the vertical reading, each column will form a two-digit number. The first column gives the tens and units digit of the first two-digit number, the second column the next, and the third column the last. Adding these three numbers should give 99. Got it.

Let me visualize the grid:

a b c
d e f

So, the top row is abc, the bottom row is def. The first vertical number is ad, the second is be, and the third is cf.

So, the conditions are:

1. abc + def = 999
2. ad + be + cf = 99

I need to find the number of such grids.

Let me think about the first condition first. Since abc and def are three-digit numbers, their sum is 999. So, abc + def = 999.

That means def = 999 - abc. So, whatever abc is, def is determined as 999 minus that number. But since def is a three-digit number, abc must be between 0 and 999, but since it's a three-digit number, abc must be at least 100. Wait, no, abc can be a three-digit number starting from 000? Wait, no, because if abc is 000, then def would be 999, but each digit is 0 except the last one. Hmm, wait, but the grid can have leading zeros, so numbers like 000 are allowed as three-digit numbers.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem allows for leading zeros. The example given has 008 and 991, so yes, leading zeros are allowed because the first row is 008, which is 8 as a number, but written as a three-digit number with leading zeros. So, each row is treated as a three-digit number, possibly with leading zeros. So, abc can be anything from 000 to 999, and def would be 999 - abc, so def would also be from 000 to 999.

But wait, def has to be a three-digit number as well, so 999 - abc must also be a three-digit number. So, abc must be such that 999 - abc is between 000 and 999. Which is always true because abc is between 000 and 999. So, no problem there.

So, for each possible abc, def is uniquely determined as 999 - abc. But, we also have the other condition, that the sum of the vertical numbers ad + be + cf = 99.

So, each vertical number is ad, be, and cf. Each is a two-digit number, formed by the digits in each column. So, for each column, the top digit is a, d; b, e; c, f.

So, ad is 10*a + d, be is 10*b + e, cf is 10*c + f.

Adding those together: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Simplify that equation:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Which can be rewritten as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, interesting. So, 10*(sum of the top row digits) + (sum of the bottom row digits) equals 99.

But wait, the sum of the top row digits is a + b + c, and the sum of the bottom row digits is d + e + f.

Let me denote S = a + b + c, and T = d + e + f.

Then, the equation becomes 10*S + T = 99.

So, 10*S + T =99. So, possible values of S and T?

Since S and T are sums of digits, they can only be integers from 0 to 27 (since
