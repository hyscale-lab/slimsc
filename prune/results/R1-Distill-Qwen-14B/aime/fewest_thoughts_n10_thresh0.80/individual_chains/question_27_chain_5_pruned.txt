Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize this. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside and outside of this sphere, and when it does, it's tangent to the sphere along a circle. The radii of these circles are r_i (internal tangent) and r_o (external tangent). I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by understanding what it means for the torus to be tangent to the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it touches along another circle. These circles of tangency must lie on the surface of both the torus and the sphere.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent, their tangent planes at the point of contact must coincide. So, for a sphere and a torus, the point of tangency must satisfy both the equations of the sphere and the torus, and their normals at that point must be the same. Maybe I can use this condition to find the radii of the circles.

Wait, but perhaps there's a better way. Maybe I can model the positions of the centers of these tangent circles relative to the sphere and torus.

Let me recall the equation of a torus. In cylindrical coordinates (r, Î¸, z), where r is the radial distance from the z-axis, the equation of a torus with major radius R and minor radius a is:

(r - R)^2 + z^2 = a^2

But in this case, the torus is created by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, so R = 6 and a = 3.

So, the equation becomes:

(r - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9

Now, the sphere has radius 11, and its equation in Cartesian coordinates is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at the origin, and the torus is resting on the inside. So, the sphere must contain the torus, and they touch along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's externally tangent, so the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

Wait, no. Actually, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the torus is inside the sphere, and when it's resting on the outside, the torus is outside the sphere, right? So, the sphere is fixed in both cases, and the torus moves either inside or outside and touches the sphere along a circle.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the centers of these circles. Let me consider the sphere's center at (0,0,0). The torus is symmetric around the z-axis because it's generated by rotating a circle around the z-axis.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency must lie along the line where the torus is closest to the sphere's center. Similarly, when it's outside, the tangency is where the torus is farthest from the sphere's center.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube.

Wait, the torus is generated by rotating a circle
