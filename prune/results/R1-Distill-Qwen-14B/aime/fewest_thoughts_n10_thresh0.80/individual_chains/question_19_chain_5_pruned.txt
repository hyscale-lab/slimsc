Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let me recall some basic definitions. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. The circumradius is the radius of the circumcircle, which is given as 13. The inradius is the radius of the incircle, given as 6.

The condition IA perpendicular to OI is interesting. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. I think I remember that in some triangles, especially certain special triangles, such a condition might hold, but I'm not exactly sure how that affects the triangle's properties. Maybe I'll need to use some coordinate geometry or vector methods here, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Circumradius (R) = 13
- Inradius (r) = 6
- IA ‚ä• OI
- Need to find AB * AC.

I think I should start by recalling some formulas that relate R, r, and the sides of the triangle. I remember that in any triangle, the area can be expressed in terms of the inradius as Area = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Also, the area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

But wait, I don't know the sides of the triangle. Maybe I can express AB * AC in terms of other variables? Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. Then, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, the area is r*s = 6s, and also (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52. Therefore, we have 6s = (a*b*c)/52, which implies that a*b*c = 6s *52 = 312s.

I'm not sure if that helps me directly, but maybe I can find another equation involving AB * AC.

Another formula I remember is that in a triangle, the length from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Wait, IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A. I think the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is something like IA = r / sin(A/2), where A is the angle at vertex A. Is that correct?

Let me confirm. The inradius is related to the angles: the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed using trigonometric functions. Yes, I think IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2) and IC = r / sin(C/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).

Similarly, the distance from the circumradius to a vertex is just R, which is 13, but that doesn't directly help.

Wait, but we have IA perpendicular to OI. So, vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, which means their dot product is zero. Maybe I can model this using coordinate geometry.

Let me try to set up a coordinate system. Let's place the incenter I at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and IA is a vector from I to A, OI is a vector from I to O. So, if I is at (0,0), then O is at some point (h, k). Then, vector IA is (x, y), and vector OI is (h, k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero: x*h + y*k = 0.

But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Maybe it's better to use vector algebra or coordinate geometry with some alignment.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use properties of triangle centers. I know that in some cases, the Euler line connects the circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter, but the incenter doesn't generally lie on the Euler line unless the triangle has some special properties, like being equilateral. But in this case, the triangle isn't necessarily equilateral, since the inradius and circumradius are different.

Wait, but the condition IA perpendicular to OI might give some relation between the sides or angles.

Another idea: Maybe I can express the vector OI in
