Alright, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, okay. So this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's think in terms of positions. Let's denote a position as losing if the current player cannot force a win, assuming both players play optimally. These are sometimes called "P-positions" (previous player wins) and "N-positions" (next player wins). Wait, actually, I think in standard terminology, P-positions are those where the previous player can force a win, meaning the current player is in a losing position. So if a position is P, the current player cannot force a win, and N is the opposite.

So, let's define the positions:

- If n=0, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So if n=0 is a losing position because there's nothing to do.

Wait, actually, in this case, since the last person to remove a token wins, if the stack is 0, the previous player has already taken the last token. So for n=0, it's an end state where the previous player has won.

So, for n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position (N-position).

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, the current player could take 4, but that's not possible since n=2 <4. So taking 1 leaves the opponent in a winning position. Wait, but if n=1 is a winning position, then n=2: current player takes 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can win. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position (P-position) because whatever the current player does, the opponent can win.

Wait, no. Wait, hold on. If the current player takes 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, and n=1 is a winning position for the opponent, meaning the opponent can take that last token and win. So yes, if n=2 is a P-position, the current player can't force a win.

Wait, but wait again. Let's think step by step.

Let me try to list the positions from 0 upwards and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's list n from 0 to, say, 10, and mark whether each is a P-position (losing for the current player) or N-position (winning).

n=0: Previous player has won. So current player cannot make a move. So n=0 is a P-position.

n=1: Current player takes 1, wins. So N-position.

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take 1 and win. So if I take 1 from 2, opponent can win. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, since 2 <4. So n=2 is a P-position.

n=3: Current player can take 1, leaving 2 (P-position). Since the opponent is now in P, meaning the opponent cannot win, so current player can force a win. Thus, n=3 is N-position.

n=4: Current player can take 4 and win. So N-position.

n=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4 (N-position). If opponent is in N, they can win. Alternatively, take 4, leaving 1 (N-position). Either way, the opponent can win. So is there any move that leaves the opponent in a P-position? Wait, for n=5:

If current player takes 1, opponent gets n=4 (N), so opponent can win.

If current player takes 4, opponent gets n=1 (N), opponent can win.

So n=5 is a P-position because all moves lead to opponent's N-position.

n=6: Let's see. Current player can take 1, leaving 5 (P). If opponent is in P, then current player can win by moving to P. So n=6 is N-position.

Because if you take 1 from 6, leaving 5, which is P, so opponent can't win. So current player can force a win.

n=7: Current player can take 1, leaving 6 (N), or take 4, leaving 3 (N). Wait, that's bad. Wait, but if the current player takes 1, opponent gets 6 (N) which is a winning position for them. If current player takes 4, opponent gets 3 (N), which is also a winning position for them. So all moves from 7 lead to opponent's N-positions, so n=7 is a P-position.

Wait, no. Wait, n=6 is N, so if you have n=7 and take 1, opponent can win. Similarly, taking 4 would leave 3, which is also N. So n=7 is a P-position.

Wait, but wait. Let me make a table:

n | Position (P or N)
--- | ---
0 | P
1 | N
2 | P
3 | N
4 | N
5 | P
6 | N
7 | P
8 | ?

Let's try n=8.

n=8: Current player can take 1, leaving 7 (P). If opponent is in P, that's good for current player. So current player can take 1, leaving opponent in P, so current player can force a win. Therefore, n=8 is N.

n=9: Current player can take 1, leaving 8 (N), or take 4, leaving 5 (P). So current player can choose to leave the opponent in P by taking 4. So n=9 is N.

Wait, n=5 is P, so if you leave opponent at 5, they can't win. So n=9 is N.

n=10: Current player can take 1, leaving 9 (N), or take 4, leaving 6 (N). Both options leave opponent in N, so n=10 is P.

Wait, that's a P-position. Because any move leads to opponent's N.

Wait, so let me make the table up to n=10.

n | Position
0 | P
1 | N
2 | P
3 | N
4 | N
5 | P
6 | N
7 | P
8 | N
9 | N
10| P

Hmm, seeing this, perhaps the P-positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,... The differences between these are 2,3,2,3, etc. So the pattern seems to be adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.

Wait, 0 to 2 is +2, 2 to 5 is +3, 5 to7 is +2, 7 to10 is +3, so next would be 10+2=12, 12+3=15, 15+2=17, 17+3=20, etc.

So the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait no, because 2 mod5 is 2, 5 is 0, 7 is 2, 10 is 0. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the P-positions follow a pattern of 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... So every two steps, the increment alternates between 2 and 3.

So 0, +2=2, +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, etc.

So the P-positions are numbers of the form 5k and 5k+2, perhaps? Let's check:

At n=5: P, yes.

n=7: 5*1 +2=7, yes.

n=10: 5*2=10, yes.

n=12:5*2+2=12? Wait, 5*2=10, 10+2=12, yes.

n=15:5*3=15, yes.

n=17:5*3+2=17, yes.

Yes, that seems to be the pattern. So the P-positions are numbers that are either 0 mod5 or 2 mod5. Because 5k and 5k+2. So numbers like 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...

Wait, let's see:

n=0: 0 mod5=0 → P

n=2: 2 mod5=2 → P

n=5:5 mod5=0 → P

n=7:7 mod5=2 → P

n=10:10 mod5=0 → P

n=12:12 mod5=2 → P

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, the P-positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but wait. Let's check n=15.

n=15: Taking 1 leaves 14, which is 14 mod5=4. So 14 is N.

Taking 4 leaves 11, which is 11 mod5=1. So 11 is N.

So both moves lead to N, so 15 is P.

Similarly, n=17: Taking 1 leaves 16 (16 mod5=1 → N) or taking4 leaves 13 (13 mod5=3 → N). So n=17 is P.

So yes, the P-positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

But wait, n=5 is 0 mod5, n=7 is 2 mod5, n=10 is 0 mod5, etc. So all P-positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

So, if this holds, then for any n ≡0 or 2 mod5, the current player is in a losing position if both play optimally. But wait, in our earlier examples, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, Alice and Bob are taking turns, with Alice starting first. We need to find the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's moves. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, Alice must be starting from a P-position.

Because if Alice starts from a P-position, then no matter what she does, Bob can respond optimally to bring the game back to another P-position, until finally, Bob takes the last token.

Therefore, the values of n where Bob can force a win are the P-positions. So n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, we need to count the number of integers n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Let me compute how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to 0 mod5 and how many are congruent to 2 mod5.

For numbers ≡0 mod5: The sequence is 5,10,15,..., up to the largest multiple of5 ≤2024.

Similarly, for numbers ≡2 mod5: The sequence is 2,7,12,17,... up to the largest number ≤2024.

So, let's compute for each congruence.

First, for n ≡0 mod5:

The maximum k where 5k ≤2024 is floor(2024/5)=404.8 → 404. So 5*404=2020. So the count is 404 numbers.

Wait, but 5*1=5, 5*2=10,...5*404=2020. So 404 numbers.

For n≡2 mod5:

The sequence starts at 2, and each term is 5k +2.

We need to find the maximum k where 5k+2 ≤2024.

So 5k ≤2022 → k ≤2022/5=404.4. So k=404. So 5*404+2=2022.

So the sequence is 2,7,...,2022. How many terms?

The number of terms is k+1, since starting at k=0: 5*0+2=2, k=1:7,...k=404:2022. So total terms is 405.

Wait, wait. Let me check with another approach.

The first term is 2, and the last term is 2022. The common difference is 5.

The number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5) +1= (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

Yes, correct.

Therefore, the total number of n ≡0 or 2 mod5 is 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Total numbers ≡0 mod5: 404.

Total numbers ≡2 mod5:405.

So total is 404 +405=809.

But let me confirm: 2024 divided by5 is 404.8. So the last multiple of5 is 2020, which is 5*404. So 404 terms.

For ≡2 mod5: The maximum is 2022=5*404 +2, so k=404, starting from k=0: 2,7,12,...2022. So that's 405 numbers.

Yes, so 404 +405=809.

So the answer is 809.

Wait, but let me make sure that the initial analysis is correct. The P-positions are n≡0 or 2 mod5, so the count is 809.

But let's test for small n.

n=0: Bob can't make a move, but n=0 isn't positive, so we don't include it.

n=2: Alice is forced to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who can take it and win. So yes, n=2 is a P-position.

n=5: Alice can take 1 or4. If she takes1, leaves4, which is N-position, so Bob can take4 and win. If she takes4, leaves1, which is N, Bob takes1 and wins. So yes, n=5 is P.

n=7: Alice can take1, leaving6 (N), Bob can take1, leaving5 (P) for Alice, but wait, let's see: n=7.

If Alice takes1: leaves6. Bob can take1, leaving5. Now it's Alice's turn with n=5, which is a P-position, so Bob can win.

Wait, no: n=5 is a P-position, which is a losing position for Alice. So Bob's move brings Alice to a losing position.

Alternatively, if Alice takes4, leaving3. Bob can take1, leaving2, which is P, so Alice can't win.

Wait, but n=3 is N, so Bob can take1, leaving2 (P). So yes, regardless of what Alice does, Bob can force the game into a P-position, leading Alice to lose.

Thus, n=7 is indeed P.

Similarly, n=10: Alice can take1, leaving9 (N). Bob can take4, leaving5 (P). Alternatively, Alice takes4, leaving6 (N). Bob can take1, leaving5 (P). So yes, n=10 is P.

Therefore, the pattern seems correct.

So, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where n≡0 or2 mod5 is 809.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{809}


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack, with Alice going first. The player who removes the last token wins.

We classify positions as either winning (N-positions) or losing (P-positions). A position is a P-position if the current player cannot force a win, and an N-position if the current player can force a win. Through analysis, we find that the P-positions follow a specific pattern.

By examining the game from \( n = 0 \) upwards, we determine that the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. This pattern is consistent and can be verified for several values of \( n \).

To find the number of such \( n \) values up to 2024:
1. Count the numbers \( n \) such that \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \). These numbers form the sequence 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. The count is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).
2. Count the numbers \( n \) such that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). These numbers form the sequence 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. The count is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2022 - 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \).

Adding these counts gives the total number of P-positions:
\[ 404 + 405 = 809 \]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{809}\).
