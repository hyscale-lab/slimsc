Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, actually, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's right because all sides are equal, so the diagonals must be perpendicular to each other. So that's an important property.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So if A is a point on the hyperbola, then the opposite point C must be the reflection of A across the origin. Similarly, if B is another point on the hyperbola, then D is the reflection of B across the origin. So, points A and C are opposites, as are B and D.

So, if I denote point A as (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, point B would be (u, v), making point D (-u, -v).

But since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, for points A, B, C, D, their coordinates must satisfy this equation.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B, B to C, C to D, and D to A should be equal. Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other, maybe it's easier to work with the properties of the diagonals.

In a rhomb
