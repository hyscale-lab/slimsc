Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, this looks a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, so the variables a, b, c can take on various nonnegative integer values as long as their sum is 300. But the second equation is a bit more complicated. It's a quadratic expression involving all three variables.

Let me look at that second equation again: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, I notice that each term is a product of one squared variable and another variable. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out some terms. Let me see:

Looking at a²b + a²c, I can factor out a², giving a²(b + c). Similarly, from b²a + b²c, I can factor out b², so that's b²(a + c). And from c²a + c²b, that's c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). So substituting these into the equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, this simplifies the equation a bit. So now each term is a cubic in each variable. Let me write this out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 300:

a² + b² + c² - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Wait, that might not be the most helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation as:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as:
