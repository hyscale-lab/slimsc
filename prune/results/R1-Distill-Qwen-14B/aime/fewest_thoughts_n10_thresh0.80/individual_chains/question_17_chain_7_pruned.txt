Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express the square of this radius as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, understanding the problem: I have a set of rectangular boxes, all with surface area 54 and volume 23. I need to find the smallest sphere that can enclose any such box. The radius of this sphere will vary depending on the box dimensions, but I guess I need the maximum possible radius across all boxes in B. Or wait, no, the sphere has to contain each box, so for each box, its maximum dimension (the space diagonal) will determine the radius needed. So the smallest sphere that can contain all boxes would have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2. Hence, I need to maximize the space diagonal of the boxes given their surface area and volume constraints.

So, the space diagonal of a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). The radius of the sphere would then be half of that, so r = (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, to minimize the radius such that it can contain any box in B, I actually need to find the maximum possible value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) among all boxes in B, and then take half of that as r.

Wait, but how do I find the maximum space diagonal given the surface area and volume constraints? Because the problem is to find the minimal r such that all boxes can fit into a sphere of radius r. So, I think I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in B, because that will be the minimal r needed to enclose the "biggest" box in B.

So, to rephrase, I need to maximize x² + y² + z², given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. Let's write down the constraints.

The surface area S of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. So, xy + yz + zx = 27.

The volume V is xyz = 23.

And I need to maximize x² + y² + z².

Hmm, so I have three variables and two equations: S = 54 and V = 23. To maximize x² + y² + z², I think I can use some optimization techniques, perhaps Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, I know that for a given surface area, the volume is maximized when the box is a cube. But here, the volume is fixed at 23. So, perhaps the box that gives the maximum space diagonal is not a cube.

Wait, maybe I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and volume? Let me think.

I recall that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). Since I know xy + yz + zx is 27, then (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 54. So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. So, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize (x + y + z)^2.

So, if I can find the maximum of x + y + z given the constraints, then I can find the maximum x² + y² + z². Therefore, I need to maximize x + y + z when xyz = 23 and xy + yz + zx = 27.

Wait, but how do I maximize x + y + z? Hmm, perhaps I can use the AM ≥ GM inequality. The AM of x, y, z is (x + y + z)/3, and the GM is (xyz)^(1/3). But since xyz is fixed at 23, the GM is fixed. So, the AM is minimized when x = y = z, but I need to maximize x + y + z.

Wait, but if I fix the product xyz, then to maximize x + y + z, the variables should be as unequal as possible. For example, if two variables are as small as possible, and one is as large as possible given the constraints. But since we also have the constraint on the surface area, which is xy + yz + zx = 27, this complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers to set up the optimization problem. Let me try that.

We have the function to maximize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27,
h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

So, using Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

We need to take the partial derivatives and set them to zero.

Compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0
∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0
∂L/∂λ = -(xy + yz + zx - 27) = 0 → xy + yz + zx = 27
∂L/∂μ = -(xyz - 23) = 0 → xyz = 23

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)
4. xy + yz + zx = 27
5. xyz = 23

This looks complicated, but maybe I can assume some symmetry. Suppose that two variables are equal, say x = y. Let me try that.

Let x = y. Then, let's denote x = y. So, we have:

From equation 1 and 2, since x = y, we have:

2x = λ(x + z) + μ(x z)
2x = λ(x + z) + μ(x z)

Which are the same, so that's consistent.

Equation 3 becomes:

2z = λ(2x) + μ(x²)

So, equation 3: 2z = 2λ x + μ x²

Equation 4: x² + 2x z = 27

Equation 5: x² z = 23

So, from equation 5: z = 23/(x²)

Substitute z into equation 4:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27

Simplify:

x² + (46)/(x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x

So, x³ -27x +46 = 0

Hmm, let me try to solve this cubic equation: x³ -27x +46 = 0.

Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠ 0

x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 → 8-54= -46, -46 +46=0. So x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0

So, the roots are x = 2, and the roots of x² + 2x -23 = 0.

The quadratic equation: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

So, x = 2, x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 2.449, or x = -1 - 2√6 (negative, discard).

So, possible x values: 2 and -1 + 2√6.

But since x is a length, it must be positive. So, x=2 or x=-1 + 2√6 ≈ 2.449.

Let me check which one is valid.

Case 1: x=2

Then z = 23/(x²) = 23/4 = 5.75

So, z = 5.75.

Check equation 3: 2z = 2λ x + μ x²

Plug in x=2, z=5.75:

2*5.75 = 2λ*2 + μ*(4)

11.5 = 4λ + 4μ

So, equation A: 4λ + 4μ = 11.5 → λ + μ = 11.5/4 = 2.875

From equation 1: 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)

But since x=y=2, equation 1 becomes:

4 = λ(2 + 5.75) + μ*(2*5.75)

4 = λ*(7.75) + μ*(11.5)

Similarly, equation 2 is the same as equation 1.

So, we have:

7.75 λ + 11.5 μ = 4

We also have equation A: λ + μ = 2.875

Let me write equation A as:

λ = 2.875 - μ

Substitute into the first equation:

7.75*(2.875 - μ) + 11.5 μ = 4

Compute 7.75 * 2.875:

Well, 7.75 * 2 =15.5, 7.75 *0.875= approx 7.75*(7/8)= approx 6.8125.

So total is approx 15.5 +6.8125=22.3125

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

2.875 is 23/8.

So, 7.75 is 31/4.

So, (31/4)*(23/8) = (713)/(32) ≈22.28125

Similarly, 7.75*(-μ) = -(31/4) μ

So, equation becomes:
