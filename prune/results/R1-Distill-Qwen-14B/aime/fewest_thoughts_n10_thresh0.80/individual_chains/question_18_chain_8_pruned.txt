Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially with an even number of sides, there are symmetries that might help in counting rectangles. A dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a pretty complex shape, but maybe I can break it down.

I think the key is to consider how rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if they are spaced evenly around the polygon. So, perhaps the number of rectangles depends on how many pairs of parallel lines there are in different directions.

Wait, let me clarify. A regular dodecagon has rotational symmetry, so the number of directions in which sides or diagonals can be parallel would correspond to the number of sides or diagonals that are spaced equally. For instance, in a regular polygon, the diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip.

In a dodecagon, the sides can be thought of as diagonals that skip 0 vertices. Diagonals that skip 1 vertex are adjacent, skipping 2, up to skipping 5 vertices because beyond that, they start repeating on the other side due to the polygon's symmetry.

So, for each type of diagonal (based on how many vertices they skip), there are a certain number of lines in that direction. For a regular n-gon, each diagonal direction has n lines, but since each line is shared by two vertices, the number might be n/2 for each direction if considering unique lines.

Wait, maybe that's not quite right. Let me think again. In a regular dodecagon, each vertex connects to 12 others, but each side or diagonal is shared by two vertices. So, the total number of sides and diagonals is (12 * 11)/2 = 66. But that's the total number of lines, but for each direction (i.e., each type of diagonal), how many are there?

For a regular polygon with n sides, the number of distinct directions for diagonals is floor(n/2). Since n=12, which is even, floor(12/2)=6. So, there are 6 distinct directions for sides and diagonals.

Wait, actually, for n even, the number of distinct directions is n/2 - 1. Because sides are considered as diagonals that skip 0 vertices, but the next is skipping 1, up to skipping (n/2 -1). For n=12, that would be 12/2 -1=5. So, 5 distinct diagonal directions. But wait, including the sides as a direction, so 6 directions in total.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight. For a regular polygon, each direction can be determined by the step between vertices. For example, in a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to the next one (step 1), then step 2
