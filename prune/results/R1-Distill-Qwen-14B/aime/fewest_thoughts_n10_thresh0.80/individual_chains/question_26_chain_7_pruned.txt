Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. We're given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, and we need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, then compute m + n.

Hmm, let me start by drawing the triangle ABC with the given side lengths. Alright, AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. So, it's a scalene triangle. Since it's inscribed in a circle, that's the circumcircle, right? So, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.

Now, the problem mentions tangents at B and C intersecting at D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. Also, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB and DC should be equal because D is the point outside the circle from which two tangents DB and DC are drawn. So, DB = DC.

Then, AD intersects the circle ω again at P. So, starting from A, drawing a line through D, which intersects the circle at P. We need to find AP.

I think I can use power of a point here. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB², since DB is a tangent from D to ω. Similarly, DC² is also equal to DB² because DB=DC.

Also, since AD is a secant intersecting the circle at A and P, the power of point D with respect to ω can also be expressed as DA * DP. So, by power of a point, DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA, then I can solve for DP, and hence find AP because AP = AD - DP or something like that? Wait, no, actually, DP = AP + PD, but since P is on the circle, depending on the position, maybe AP is the segment from A to P, and DP is from D to P. Hmm, perhaps I should write the equation properly.

Power of point D: DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I let DA = x, and DP = y, then DB² = x * y. But since P lies on AD, then AP would be equal to DA - DP if D is outside the circle. Wait, but in this case, D is outside the circle because it's the intersection of two tangents. So, AD is a secant starting at A (on the circle) going through D (outside) and intersecting the circle again at P. So, in that case, AP is the part from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, in terms of lengths, AP = AD - PD. Wait, no, because A is on the circle. So, the secant is AD, which starts at A, goes through P, and exits at D. So, the length from A to P is AP, and from P to D is PD. So, the entire length AD = AP + PD.

Wait, but in the power of a point formula, for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the entire secant segment and its external part. So, for point D, if the secant is D-P-A (meaning D is outside, then P, then A inside), but in our case, A is on the circle, so the power of D is DA * DP. Because the formula is: if from D, a secant D-P-A is drawn, then power of D is DP * DA. Alternatively, since A is on the circle, DA is the tangent? No, wait, DA is a secant because it starts at D, goes through P, and ends at A on the circle. So, the power of point D is DP * DA, but
