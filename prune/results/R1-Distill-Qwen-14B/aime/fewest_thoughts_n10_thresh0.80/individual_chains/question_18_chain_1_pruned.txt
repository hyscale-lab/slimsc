Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Since it's regular, it's symmetric, which might help in counting the rectangles.

I also know that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by connecting certain vertices. But wait, a rectangle requires four sides with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, in a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon, how can I form such rectangles?

Let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon, so it's quite a complex shape. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So, if I label the vertices from 0 to 11 in a clockwise manner, each vertex is 30 degrees apart (since 360/12 = 30).

Now, to form a rectangle, I need four points such that the sides are parallel and equal. Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals have specific lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. So, maybe the sides of the rectangle correspond to certain diagonals?

Wait, hold on. The sides of the rectangle lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle must be a line segment that is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

So, each side of the rectangle is a chord of the circle in which the dodecagon is inscribed. And for it to be a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and all angles must be 90 degrees.

Hmm. So, maybe the key is to find four points in the dodecagon such that the distances between them correspond to equal lengths and meet at right angles.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to count all possible rectangles by considering different possible pairs of sides.

Wait, another thought: in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel sides. For example, in a regular hexagon, you can form rectangles by selecting opposite sides.

But in a dodecagon, with more sides, there are more possibilities. So, maybe the number of rectangles is related to the number of pairs of parallel sides or diagonals.

Wait, each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel chords. So, perhaps I can count the number of ways to choose two different directions of parallel chords and then count how many such pairs exist for each direction.

But in a regular dodecagon, how many different directions of parallel chords are there?

Each side of the dodecagon is in a specific direction, determined by the angle it makes with a reference line. Since the dodecagon has 12 sides, the angles between adjacent sides are 30 degrees. So, the sides are at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, ...,
