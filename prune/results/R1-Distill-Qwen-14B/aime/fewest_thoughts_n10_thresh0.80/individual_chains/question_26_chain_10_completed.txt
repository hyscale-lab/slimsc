Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The problem says:

Let triangle ABC be inscribed in circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We’re given AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Alright, first, let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, drawing a line from A through D, which intersects the circumcircle again at P. We need to find the length AP.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point to a circle, that point is called the external point, and the lengths of the tangents from that point to the circle are equal. So, D is the external point, and the lengths DB and DC are equal because they’re both tangents from D to ω.

Wait, that’s right. So, DB = DC. That might come in handy.

Since tangents from a common external point are equal, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Now, AD is a line from A to D, passing through the circle again at P. So, AP is a segment from A to P, and we need its length.

I think I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or perhaps power of a point here.

Wait, power of a point D with respect to ω. The power of D is equal to DB² since D lies on the tangent at B, similarly, DC². Since DB = DC, the power is DB².

Also, since line AD passes through P, which is on ω, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DP * DA.

So, Power of D: DB² = DP * DA.

Let me write that down:

DB² = DP * DA.

But wait, DA is equal to DP + PA? Or is it DP = DA + AP? Wait, no. Let me think: AD is a line from A to D, and P is between A and D, right? Because P is the second intersection point of AD with ω. So, the order is A-P-D. Therefore, DA = DP + PA. So, DP = DA - PA.

Wait, but in terms of segments: DA is the entire length from A to D, and DP is from D to P, so AP is from A to P. So, AP = AD - DP.

Wait, but Power of a Point says that DP * DA = DB². Let me clarify:

When a line passes through a point D outside the circle and intersects the circle at two points, P and A (assuming A is on the circle). Wait, no, A is on the circle because ABC is inscribed in ω. So, AD is a secant that passes through A and P, with A on the circle and P the other intersection point. So, the Power of a Point formula would be DP * DA = DB².

Wait, no, the correct formula is DP * DA = DB². Wait, but in the standard formula, if a secant from D passes through two points on the circle, say X and Y, then DX * DY = DB². But in this case, since A is on the circle, and P is the other intersection, so it should be DP * DA = DB².

Wait, let me double-check. If D is outside the circle, and line DA passes through the circle at A and P, then the power of point D is equal to DA * DP = DB². Hmm, actually, I think when you have a secant that goes through two points on the circle, the formula is DA * DP = DB², where DA is the entire length from D to A, but wait, no, DA is from D to A, which is beyond the circle, but since A is on the circle, DP would be from D to P, where P is the other intersection point. So, the formula is DP * DA = DB². Wait, no, no, let me think again.

Wait, no, the Power of a Point theorem says that for a point D outside the circle, if two secants pass through D and intersect the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = DB², where DB is the length of the tangent. So, in this case, the secant is D-A-P, but since A is on the circle, the two points are A and P. So, the power is DA * DP = DB².

Wait, but DA is from D to A, which is beyond the circle, so DP is from D to P, which is inside the circle? Wait, no. Wait, AD is a line passing through A (on the circle) and extending to D (outside). So, the two points where the secant intersects the circle are A and P. So, the power would be DA * DP = DB². Wait, but DA is the length from D to A, which is outside to on the circle, and DP is from D to P, which is the other intersection. But P is between A and D? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, A is on the circle, and P is another point where AD intersects the circle again. So, starting from D, the line goes through P (which is on the circle), then through A (which is also on the circle). Wait, no, that can't be, because D is outside the circle. So, the line passes through D, then through P, then through A. So, P is between D and A. Therefore, the two points where the secant meets the circle are P and A. So, the power of D would be DP * DA = DB².

Wait, no, if the line passes through D, then P is the first intersection (closer to D), then A is the second intersection (further from D). Therefore, the power is DP * DA = DB².

Wait, but that can't be right because DA is the distance from D to A, which would include DP plus PA. Wait, hold on, maybe I should denote the lengths properly. Let me assign variables:

Let’s let AP = x. Then, since AD is the entire length from A to D, and P is along AD, then AP = x, PD = AD - AP = AD - x. Wait, but according to the Power of a Point, the product is DP * DA = DB².

But wait, actually, the correct formula is DP * DA = DB². Wait, but DP is the length from D to P, and DA is from D to A. So, if P is between D and A, then DA = DP + PA. So, DA = DP + x, where x is AP.

So, DP = DA - x.

But then, the power of point D is DP * DA = DB².

Wait, no, that would be (DA - x) * DA = DB².

But that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should think of it differently.

Wait, the power of D is equal to DP * DQ, where DP and DQ are the lengths from D to the two intersection points. If the line passes through D, then goes through P and A, then DP is the distance from D to P, and DA is the distance from D to A. So, the power is DP * DA = DB².

Wait, no. Wait, the standard formula is if a secant from D passes through the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY = DB². So in this case, the two points are P and A because A is on the circle. So, the distances from D to P and D to A. So, DP * DA = DB².

But if P is between D and A, then DA = DP + PA. So, DA = DP + x. Therefore, DP = DA - x.

So, substituting into the power equation: DP * DA = DB².

So, (DA - x) * DA = DB².

Which gives DA² - DA x = DB².

But I don't know DA or DB yet. So, maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, maybe use coordinate geometry or trigonometry. Since the sides are given, perhaps we can compute coordinates or use the Law of Cosines.

Given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me try to compute some angles or other lengths.

First, perhaps compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, since the points B and C are on ω, and D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

Wait, the distance from D to ω is DB = DC, and D lies on the external homothety axis or something. Alternatively, maybe use coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps use inversion. Hmm, but inversion might be too complicated.

Alternatively, use coordinate geometry: place triangle ABC in a coordinate system, compute the equation of the circumcircle, find the equations of the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find the equation of line AD, find its other intersection point P with the circumcircle, compute AP.

That seems doable, but might take a while.

Let me try that approach.

First, set up coordinate system:

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Let me place point A at (10,0), since AC=10. Then point B will be somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of B.

Given that AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

So, coordinates:

A: (10, 0)

C: (0, 0)

Point B: (x, y)

We have AB = 5, so distance from A(10,0) to B(x,y) is 5:

√[(x -10)^2 + (y)^2] = 5 ⇒ (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 25. (1)

Also, BC = 9, so distance from B(x,y) to C(0,0) is 9:

√(x² + y²) = 9 ⇒ x² + y² = 81. (2)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

x² + y² - [(x -10)^2 + y^2] = 81 - 25 ⇒ x² - (x² -20x +100) = 56 ⇒ x² -x² +20x -100 = 56 ⇒ 20x = 156 ⇒ x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So, x = 39/5 = 7.8.

Then, plugging back into equation (2):

(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81 ⇒ (1521/25) + y² = 81 ⇒ y² = 81 - 1521/25 ⇒ 81 is 2025/25, so 2025/25 -1521/25 = 504/25 ⇒ y = √(504/25) = (√504)/5.

Simplify √504: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Wait, 504 factors: 504 = 16 * 31.5, but that's not helpful. Let me factor 504:

504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 * 7 = 8 * 9 * 7. So, √504 = √(8*9*7) = √(36*14) = 6√14.

So, y = (6√14)/5. So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates:

A: (10, 0)

B: (39/5, 6√14/5)

C: (0,0)

Now, let's find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

We know three points on the circle: A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0). Let me find the equation of the circumcircle.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Plugging in point C(0,0):

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 ⇒ F = 0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.

Plugging in A(10,0):

10² + 0 + D*10 + E*0 = 0 ⇒ 100 + 10D = 0 ⇒ 10D = -100 ⇒ D = -10.

So, equation becomes x² + y² -10x + Ey = 0.

Now, plug in point B(39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)² + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) = 0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

-10*(39/5) = -78.

E*(6√14/5) = (6√14 E)/5.

So, the equation becomes:

(1521/25) + (504/25) -78 + (6√14 E)/5 = 0.

Combine the fractions:

(1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.

So, 81 -78 + (6√14 E)/5 = 0.

Simplify:

3 + (6√14 E)/5 = 0 ⇒ (6√14 E)/5 = -3 ⇒ E = (-3 *5)/(6√14) = (-15)/(6√14) = (-5)/(2√14).

Rationalize the denominator:

E = (-5√14)/(2*14) = (-5√14)/28.

Thus, the equation of the circumcircle is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y = 0.

Alternatively, I can write it as:

x² + y² -10x - (5√14)/28 y = 0.

Now, I need to find the point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

To find the equation of the tangent at a point on a circle, we can use the formula for the tangent to a circle at a given point (x₁,y₁):

xx₁ + yy₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0.

Wait, but since we have the general equation x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0, the tangent at (x₁,y₁) is:

xx₁ + yy₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0.

But I think another way is to use point-slope form. The tangent at point (x₁,y₁) on the circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the slope of the radius is (y₁ - k)/(x₁ - h), where (h,k) is the center. Alternatively, since the general equation is given, perhaps we can compute the tangent lines.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, let's find the center of the circle. The general equation is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y = 0.

Comparing to the standard form (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2,

We can write:

x² -10x + y² - (5√14/28)y = 0.

Complete the squares.

For x:

x² -10x = (x -5)^2 -25.

For y:

y² - (5√14/28)y = [y - (5√14/(2*28))]^2 - (5√14/(2*28))².

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

The coefficient of y is -(5√14)/28. So, half of that is -(5√14)/56. Squaring that gives (25*14)/(56²).

So, (5√14/56)^2 = (25*14)/(56²) = 350/(3136) = 25/224.

So, the equation becomes:

(x -5)^2 -25 + (y - 5√14/56)^2 -25/224 = 0.

Bring the constants to the right:

(x -5)^2 + (y - 5√14/56)^2 = 25 + 25/224.

Compute 25 + 25/224 = (25 *224 +25)/224 = 25*(224 +1)/224 = 25*225/224 = 5625/224.

So, the center is at (5, 5√14/56) and radius squared is 5625/224.

But maybe I don't need the center for finding the tangent lines. Let me think.

Alternatively, the equation for the tangent at point C(0,0):

Since point C is on the circle, the tangent at C can be found using the formula.

Given the circle equation x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y = 0.

The tangent at (0,0) is:

0*x + 0*y + (-10)*(x + 0)/2 + (-5√14/28)*(y + 0)/2 + 0 = 0.

Wait, not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I can use the fact that the tangent at (x₁,y₁) is given by:

xx₁ + yy₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0.

So, for point C(0,0):

x*0 + y*0 + D*(x +0)/2 + E*(y +0)/2 + F = 0 ⇒ (D x)/2 + (E y)/2 + F = 0.

But F is 0, as we found earlier.

So, D x / 2 + E y / 2 = 0.

We have D = -10, E = -5√14/28.

So, substituting:

(-10)x/2 + (-5√14/28)y / 2 = 0 ⇒ (-5)x + (-5√14/56)y = 0.

Multiply both sides by -56 to eliminate denominators:

56*5 x +5√14 y = 0 ⇒ 280x +5√14 y = 0.

Simplify by dividing both sides by 5:

56x + √14 y = 0.

So, the tangent at C is 56x + √14 y = 0.

Similarly, find the tangent at B(39/5, 6√14/5).

Using the same formula:

xx₁ + yy₁ + D*(x +x₁)/2 + E*(y +y₁)/2 + F = 0.

Where x₁ = 39/5, y₁ =6√14/5.

So,

x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 + (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2 + 0=0.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (39/5)x.

Second term: (6√14/5)y.

Third term: (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 = (-10/2)(x +39/5) = -5*(x + 39/5) = -5x -39.

Fourth term: (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2 = (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2 = multiply numerator and denominator:

= (-5√14)(y +6√14/5) / (28*2) = (-5√14)(y + 6√14/5) /56.

Let me compute the numerator:

-5√14 * y -5√14*(6√14)/5.

Simplify each term:

-5√14 y - (5*6*14)/5.

Because √14 * √14 =14, and the 5 in the denominator cancels with the 5 in numerator.

So, that becomes:

-5√14 y - (6*14) = -5√14 y -84.

So, the fourth term is (-5√14 y -84)/56.

Putting it all together:

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5√14 y -84)/56 = 0.

Let me get rid of the denominators by multiplying the entire equation by 56*5=280 to eliminate denominators.

Multiply each term by 280:

280*(39/5)x + 280*(6√14/5)y + 280*(-5x) +280*(-39) +280*(-5√14 y -84)/56 =0.

Compute each term:

280*(39/5)x = (280/5)*39 x =56*39 x =2208x.

280*(6√14/5)y = (280/5)*6√14 y =56*6√14 y =336√14 y.

280*(-5x) = -1400x.

280*(-39) = -10920.

280*(-5√14 y -84)/56 = (280/56)*(-5√14 y -84) =5*(-5√14 y -84) = -25√14 y -420.

So, putting it all together:

2208x +336√14 y -1400x -10920 -25√14 y -420 =0.

Combine like terms:

x terms: 2208x -1400x = 808x.

y terms: 336√14 y -25√14 y = (336 -25)√14 y = 311√14 y.

Constant terms: -10920 -420 = -11340.

So, the equation becomes:

808x +311√14 y -11340 =0.

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, maybe there's a better way to find the tangent at B. Since the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius at B. The radius from center O to B has slope (y_B - k)/(x_B - h), where O is at (5,5√14/56).

Wait, O is center at (5,5√14/56). Point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, the slope of OB is (6√14/5 -5√14/56)/(39/5 -5).

Compute numerator:

6√14/5 -5√14/56 = (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5)/(5*56) = (336√14 -25√14)/280 = (311√14)/280.

Denominator: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5) = (311√14/280)*(5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify: 1555 and 3920 can both be divided by 5: 1555/5=311, 3920/5=784.

So, slope of OB is (311√14)/784.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of that.

So, slope of tangent = -784/(311√14).

Simplify: Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

= -784√14/(311*14) = -784√14/(4354) = Simplify 784 and 4354.

Wait, 784 is 28^2, and 4354 divided by 14 is 311.

Wait, 784/14=56. So, 784√14/(311*14) = 56√14/311.

So, slope is -56√14/311.

Thus, the tangent at B has slope m = -56√14/311.

Now, using point-slope form, the equation of tangent at B is:

y - y_B = m(x -x_B).

Which is:

y - (6√14/5) = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Similarly, the tangent at C is 56x +√14 y =0, as we found earlier.

Now, to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.

So, we have two equations:

1. 56x +√14 y =0.

2. y - (6√14/5) = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Let me solve these two equations.

From equation 1: 56x +√14 y =0 ⇒ y = -56x /√14.

Simplify: y = -56/√14 x = -56√14/14 x = -4√14 x.

So, equation 1 gives y = -4√14 x.

Now, substitute this into equation 2.

Equation 2:

y -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Substitute y= -4√14 x:

-4√14 x -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Let me factor out √14 on both sides:

√14*(-4x -6/5) = √14*(-56/311)(x -39/5).

Divide both sides by √14:

-4x -6/5 = (-56/311)(x -39/5).

Multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

-4x*311 -6/5*311 = -56(x -39/5).

Compute each term:

-4*311 x = -1244x.

-6/5*311 = - (6*311)/5 = -1866/5.

On the right side:

-56(x -39/5) = -56x + (56*39)/5 = -56x + 2184/5.

So, putting it together:

-1244x -1866/5 = -56x + 2184/5.

Bring all terms to the left:

-1244x +56x -1866/5 -2184/5 =0.

Combine like terms:

(-1244 +56)x + (-1866 -2184)/5 =0 ⇒ (-1188)x + (-4050)/5 =0 ⇒ -1188x -810=0.

So, -1188x =810 ⇒ x= -810/1188.

Simplify the fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 18:

810 ÷18=45, 1188 ÷18=66.

So, x= -45/66.

Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:

45 ÷3=15, 66 ÷3=22. So, x= -15/22.

Then, y= -4√14 x ⇒ y= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we have point A at (10,0) and point D at (-15/22, 30√14/11). We need to find the equation of line AD.

First, compute the slope of AD.

Slope m_AD = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D -x_A) = (30√14/11 -0)/(-15/22 -10).

Simplify denominator:

-15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-15 -220)/22 = -235/22.

So, slope m_AD = (30√14/11) / (-235/22) = (30√14/11) * (22/-235) = (30√14 *2)/(-235) = (60√14)/(-235) = -60√14 /235.

Simplify the fraction: 60 and 235 can both be divided by 5.

60 ÷5=12, 235 ÷5=47.

So, slope m_AD = -12√14 /47.

Thus, equation of AD is:

y -0 = (-12√14 /47)(x -10).

So, y = (-12√14 /47)x + (120√14)/47.

Now, we need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle ω.

We have the equation of ω: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

And the equation of AD: y = (-12√14 /47)x + (120√14)/47.

Substitute y into the circle equation:

x² + [(-12√14 /47 x + 120√14/47)]² -10x - (5√14/28)[(-12√14 /47 x + 120√14/47)] =0.

This looks complicated, but let's proceed step by step.

First, compute [(-12√14 /47 x + 120√14/47)]².

Let me denote term1 = (-12√14 /47)x + 120√14/47.

Then, term1² = [(-12√14 x + 120√14)/47]^2 = [√14*(-12x +120)/47]^2 =14*( -12x +120 )² / (47²).

Compute (-12x +120)^2 = 144x² - 2880x +14400.

So, term1² =14*(144x² -2880x +14400)/(47²) = (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209.

Now, expand the circle equation substitution:

x² + term1² -10x - (5√14/28)*term1 =0.

So,

x² + (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209 -10x - (5√14/28)*( (-12√14 /47 x + 120√14/47) )=0.

Simplify term by term.

First term: x².

Second term: (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209.

Third term: -10x.

Fourth term: Let's compute (5√14/28)*( -12√14 /47 x + 120√14/47 ).

Factor out √14:

= (5√14/28)*(√14*(-12x +120)/47) =5*(14)/28*(-12x +120)/47 = (5*14)/28*(-12x +120)/47.

Simplify 5*14=70; 70/28=5/2.

So, fourth term becomes (5/2)*(-12x +120)/47 = (5*(-12x +120))/(2*47) = (-60x +600)/(94).

So, the fourth term is (-60x +600)/94.

But since the equation has - (fourth term), it's + (60x -600)/94.

Now, putting all together:

x² + (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209 -10x + (60x -600)/94 =0.

Multiply all terms by 2209 *94 to eliminate denominators.

Compute 2209 *94: 2209 is 47², 94=2*47. So, 47² *2*47 = 2*47³.

But let me compute 2209 *94:

2209 *94 = 2209*(90 +4) =2209*90 +2209*4.

2209*90= 2209*9*10= 19881*10=198810.

2209*4=8836.

So, total=198810 +8836=207,646.

So, multiply each term by 207,646:

Term1: x² *207646.

Term2: (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209 *207646 = (2016x² -40320x +201600) * (207646/2209).

Compute 207646 /2209: since 2209*94=207,646, then 207646/2209=94.

So, term2 becomes (2016x² -40320x +201600)*94.

Term3: -10x *207646 = -2,076,460x.

Term4: (60x -600)/94 *207646 = (60x -600)*(207646 /94).

207646 /94= 2209, because 94*2209=207,646.

So, term4 becomes (60x -600)*2209.

So, putting all together:

207646 x² + [2016x² -40320x +201600]*94 -2,076,460x + (60x -600)*2209 =0.

This is a quartic equation, but it's actually a quadratic in x because when we substitute y, it's a quadratic equation. However, since we already know that A(10,0) lies on both the line and the circle, x=10 is a root. We need the other root, which will give us x-coordinate of P.

Let me denote the equation as:

A x² + Bx + C =0.

But since it's a quadratic, and x=10 is a root, we can factor it as (x -10)(something)=0.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that in a quadratic equation, the sum of roots is -B/A, and product is C/A.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, expand term2: [2016x² -40320x +201600] *94.

Compute each part:

2016x² *94 = 2016*94 x² = Let's compute 2000*94=188,000 and 16*94=1,504 → total 188,000 +1,504=189,504 x².

-40320x *94= -40320*94 x. Compute 40320*94: 40320*90=3,628,800; 40320*4=161,280 → total 3,628,800 +161,280=3,790,080. So, -3,790,080 x.

201600 *94= Let's compute 200,000*94=18,800,000; 1,600*94=150,400 → total 18,800,000 +150,400=18,950,400.

So, term2 is 189,504 x² -3,790,080 x +18,950,400.

Term4: (60x -600)*2209.

Compute 60x*2209=132,540x.

-600*2209= -1,325,400.

So, term4 is 132,540x -1,325,400.

Now, term1 is 207,646 x².

Term3 is -2,076,460x.

Now, sum all terms:

x² terms:

207,646 x² +189,504 x² = 207,646 +189,504 = 397,150 x².

x terms:

-2,076,460x -3,790,080x +132,540x = (-2,076,460 -3,790,080 +132,540) x.

Compute:

-2,076,460 -3,790,080 = -5,866,540; then +132,540 gives -5,734,000 x.

Constants:

18,950,400 -1,325,400 =17,625,000.

So, the equation becomes:

397,150 x² -5,734,000 x +17,625,000 =0.

We can simplify this by dividing by 50:

397,150 /50=7,943.

5,734,000 /50=114,680.

17,625,000 /50=352,500.

So, equation simplifies to:

7,943 x² -114,680 x +352,500 =0.

This is a quadratic in x: a=7,943; b=-114,680; c=352,500.

We know x=10 is a solution because point A is on both the line and the circle.

So, to find the other root, we can factor it as (x-10)(something)=0.

Alternatively, using the quadratic formula, but since we know one root, perhaps use Vieta's formula.

Sum of roots = 10 + x_p = 114,680 /7,943.

Compute 114,680 ÷7,943.

Let me compute 7,943*14=111, 11, 7,943*14: 7,943*10=79,430; 7,943*4=31,772 → total 111,202.

So, 7,943 *14=111,202. Subtract from 114,680: 114,680 -111,202=3,478.

So, 7,943*14 +3,478=114,680.

So, 114,680 /7,943 =14 +3,478/7,943.

But 3,478 and 7,943: let's see if they share a common factor.

Compute GCD(3478,7943). Let's compute 7943 ÷3478.

3478*2=6956. 7943 -6956=987.

Now, GCD(3478,987).

3478 ÷987=3*987=2961, 3478-2961=517.

GCD(987,517).

987 ÷517=1*517=517, remainder 987-517=470.

GCD(517,470).

517-470=47.

GCD(470,47)=47.

So, GCD is 47.

Thus, 3,478 ÷47=74 (47*74=3,478).

7,943 ÷47=169, since 47*169=7,943.

So, 3,478/7,943=74/169.

Thus, 114,680 /7,943 =14 +74/169= (14*169 +74)/169= (2366 +74)/169=2440/169.

So, sum of roots is 2440/169.

But one root is x=10, so x_p=2440/169 -10=2440/169 -1,690/169=750/169.

So, x_p=750/169.

That's the x-coordinate of P.

Now, find y_p using equation of AD: y = (-12√14 /47)x + (120√14)/47.

So, y_p= (-12√14 /47)*(750/169) + (120√14)/47.

Compute each term:

First term: (-12√14 /47)*(750/169) = (-9000√14)/(47*169).

Second term: (120√14)/47 = (120√14 *169)/(47*169)=20,280√14/(47*169).

So, y_p= [ -9000√14 +20,280√14 ] / (47*169) = (11,280√14)/(47*169).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

11,280 ÷47: Let's compute 47*240=11,280. So, 11,280=47*240.

So, y_p= (47*240√14)/(47*169)=240√14/169.

Thus, point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, we need to find AP. Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Compute the distance between A and P.

Use the distance formula:

AP = √[(750/169 -10)^2 + (240√14/169 -0)^2].

Compute each component:

750/169 -10 =750/169 -1690/169= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.

240√14/169 remains as is.

So,

AP=√[ (-940/169)^2 + (240√14/169)^2 ].

Compute each square:

(-940/169)^2 = (940)^2 / (169)^2 = 883,600 /28,561.

(240√14 /169)^2 = (240² *14)/169².

Compute 240²=57,600. So, 57,600*14=806,400. So, 806,400 /28,561.

Add both terms:

883,600 /28,561 +806,400 /28,561 = (883,600 +806,400)/28,561 = 1,690,000 /28,561.

So, AP=√(1,690,000 /28,561)=√(1,690,000)/√28,561.

Compute √1,690,000: √(1,690,000)=1,300.

√28,561: 28,561 is 169², since 169*169=28,561.

So, AP=1,300 /169.

Simplify 1,300 /169: 169*7=1,183; 1,300 -1,183=117. 169*7=1,183; 117=169*(117/169)=13²*9/(13²)=9/1.

Wait, 1,300 ÷169: 169*7=1,183. 1,300-1,183=117.

117=169*(117/169)= (9*13)/13²)=9/13.

Wait, 117=9*13, 169=13².

So, 117/169=9/13.

So, 1,300 /169 =7 +117/169=7 +9/13= (7*13 +9)/13=91+9=100/13.

Wait, that can't be right because 100/13 is approximately 7.69, but our calculation was 1,300/169.

Wait, 169*7=1,183; 169*7.69= approximately 1,300.

Wait, let me compute 1,300 ÷169.

169 ×7 =1,183.

1,300 -1,183=117.

117 ÷169=9/13.

So, 1,300/169=7 and 9/13=7.6923...

But 7.6923 is 100/13, because 100 ÷13≈7.6923.

Wait, yes, 100/13≈7.6923.

Wait, but 7×13=91; 91+9=100. So, 100/13 is 7 and 9/13.

So, 1,300/169=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

Thus, AP=100/13, which is already in lowest terms since 100 and 13 share no common factors besides 1.

So, m=100, n=13. Therefore, m +n=113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) has sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). We need to find the length \(AP\), where \(P\) is the second intersection point of line \(AD\) with the circumcircle \(\omega\) of triangle \(ABC\).

First, we place the triangle in a coordinate system with \(C\) at the origin \((0,0)\) and \(A\) at \((10,0)\). Using the distance formula, we find the coordinates of \(B\) as \(\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right)\).

Next, we determine the equation of the circumcircle \(\omega\). The general equation of the circle is found to be \(x^2 + y^2 - 10x - \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{28}y = 0\).

We then find the equations of the tangents at points \(B\) and \(C\). The tangent at \(C\) is found to be \(56x + \sqrt{14}y = 0\), and the tangent at \(B\) is derived using the point-slope form. Solving these two tangent equations gives the coordinates of point \(D\) as \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

The equation of line \(AD\) is determined using the slope between points \(A\) and \(D\). Substituting this into the circumcircle equation and solving the resulting quadratic equation gives the \(x\)-coordinate of point \(P\) as \(\frac{750}{169}\). Using the equation of line \(AD\), we find the \(y\)-coordinate of \(P\) as \(\frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\).

Finally, we compute the distance \(AP\) using the distance formula. The result simplifies to \(\frac{100}{13}\). Therefore, \(m = 100\) and \(n = 13\), leading to \(m + n = 113\).

\(\boxed{113}\)
