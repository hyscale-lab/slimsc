Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what’s being asked.

The problem says: Let 𝒜 be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let r be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. We need to find r², express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Alright, so the key points here are:

1. Rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.
2. Find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box.
3. Compute r², which is the square of the radius of this sphere.
4. Express r² as a reduced fraction and sum the numerator and denominator.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me recall that for a rectangular box with sides of length x, y, z, the surface area S is given by:

S = 2(xy + yz + xz)

And the volume V is:

V = xyz

In this case, S = 54 and V = 23.

We can write:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27

And:

xyz = 23

Now, the problem is about finding the minimal enclosing sphere for such boxes. The sphere's diameter should be equal to the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must contain the entire box, and the space diagonal is the longest distance within the box. So, the radius of the sphere would be half of this space diagonal.

The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is given by:

d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)

So, the radius r is d/2, hence r² = (d²)/4 = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Therefore, our goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z², given the constraints that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.

So, the problem reduces to optimizing (minimizing) x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but since it's symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps the minimal occurs when x = y = z? Wait, but if x = y = z, then the box would be a cube.

Let me check: If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x = 3. Then the volume would be 27, but in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box can't be a cube because the volume is less. Therefore, the minimal enclosing sphere doesn't correspond to a cube. So, the minimal x² + y² + z² when the constraints are given must be achieved when the box isn't a cube.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal? Sometimes, in symmetric problems, setting variables equal can lead to extrema. Let me try that approach.

So, let's assume x = y. Then, the constraints become:

xy + yz + xz = x² + 2xz = 27

and

xyz = x² z = 23

So, from the volume equation: z = 23/(x²)

Plugging into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 2
