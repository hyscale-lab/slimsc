Okay, so I have this problem where I need to place chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're all indistinct, meaning I can't tell them apart except by color. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that in any row or column where there are chips, all those chips must be the same color. Also, once I place the chips, adding any additional chip would break one of the previous two rules. I have to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. Each row and each column needs to have all chips of the same color if there are any chips in them. So, for any given row, it can be all white, all black, or empty. Same goes for each column. But wait, there's an additional condition that no additional chip can be placed without violating the rules. That probably means that the configuration is maximal—meaning you can't add any more chips without breaking the color uniformity in some row or column.

So, the first thought is that each row can be either white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be white, black, or empty. But they can't all be empty because the grid has to hold some chips. Wait, no, actually, maybe not. Because the condition is about adding more chips, but if all rows and columns are empty, that's a trivial case, but the problem probably expects at least some chips on the grid. Hmm, but the problem statement says "some" chips, so I think the grid must have at least one chip.

But let me think: if I have a configuration where, say, all rows are empty except one, which is all white, then the columns corresponding to that row would be white if they have a chip. But then, in that case, you could potentially add a black chip to another row or column, but wait, if all the columns have white in that row, adding a black chip in another row would require that the entire column is black. Hmm, maybe not, because each column can have all white, all black, or empty. But if I have a white chip in a column, then to add a black chip to that column, I would have to make all the other cells in that column black, which might not be possible if some cells are already white.

Wait, no. Each column can be either all white, all black, or empty, but if a column has any chips, they must all be the same color. So, if I have a white chip in a column, that column is entirely white. So, you can't add a black chip to that column. So, if I have a configuration where some rows and columns have chips, then adding a chip is only allowed in rows and columns that are currently empty. But wait, if a row is empty, then I can add a chip there, but I have to make sure that any column I add it to is also empty. Because if the column already has chips of another color, I can't add a different color.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as each row and column being either white, black, or empty. But the key is that the entire configuration is maximal, meaning that no more chips can be placed without violating the color uniformity. So, in such a maximal configuration, every empty row and every empty column must have at least one cell that's already occupied by the opposite color or something? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think differently.

Perhaps a better approach is to model this as a bipartite graph. Let's say the rows and columns are two disjoint sets, and a chip placement is an edge between a row and column. Each edge is colored either white or black. The condition is that all edges incident to a row must have the same color, and similarly for columns. So this is equivalent to a bi-edge-coloring where each node (row or column) has edges of only one color or none.

Wait, but no, each row can have edges of only one color, and each column can have edges of only one color. So, in other words, the graph is a collection of complete bipartite graphs where each connected component is a complete bipartite graph between a subset of rows and columns, and each such component is monochromatic—either all white or all black.

Wait, that's an interesting way to think about it. So, each component is a complete bipartite graph (so every row in the subset is connected to every column in the subset) and all edges in the component have the same color. So, the grid can be partitioned into such monochromatic complete bipartite components.

But in our problem, we have 25 white chips and 25 black chips. Wait, no, the problem says "some" chips placed, but the total chips used can't exceed 25 white and 25 black. Wait, actually, the problem says "Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells...", so the number of chips placed can be any number up to 25 white and 25 black, but in such a way that the conditions are satisfied, and adding any more would violate the conditions. So, it's a maximal placement.

But I think the bipartite graph approach could still be useful. So, each such maximal placement would correspond to a set of monochromatic complete bipartite graphs covering the grid without overlapping, such that every row and column is in at most one such component. Because if a row is in one component, it can't be in another, since all its chips are the same color.

Wait, but each row is either white, black, or empty. So, each row can
