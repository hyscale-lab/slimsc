Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because the description is a bit complex.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that means they all lie on a straight line. Hmm, I should probably draw a rough sketch to get a better idea. Let me see, ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. The sides BC and FG are given as 16 and 17 respectively, and AB and EF are 107 and 184. So, AB and EF are the lengths of the rectangles.

Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC is the same as AD, which is 16, and AB is the same as CD, which is 107. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, FG is 17, which would make EH also 17, and EF is 184, so GH is also 184.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, then E is a corner of EFGH, then C is another corner of ABCD, and F is a corner of EFGH, all lying on a straight line. Interesting. Also, it's given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Hmm, so those four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might be useful.

Let me try to sketch this in my mind. Rectangle ABCD: let's assume it's placed with AB horizontal and BC vertical. So, point A is bottom-left, B is bottom-right, C is top-right, D is top-left. Similarly, rectangle EFGH: E is bottom-left, F is bottom-right, G is top-right, H is top-left. Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line goes through D, E, C, F.

Wait, but D is top-left of ABCD, and C is top-right, so D to C is the top side of ABCD. But E and F are points on this line as well. So, E and F must be somewhere along DC. But E is a corner of EFGH, which is another rectangle. So, E is connected to F, which is another corner of EFGH. Since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are 184 and 17, so EF is the base, FG is the height.

Wait, if E and F are on the line DC, then EF is a side of EFGH. So that would mean that EFGH is positioned such that its base EF is along DC, but since E and F are on DC, which is the top side of ABCD. Hmm.

But then, H and G, which are the other two corners of EFGH, must be connected in such a way that EFGH is a rectangle. Since E and F are on DC, and H and G
