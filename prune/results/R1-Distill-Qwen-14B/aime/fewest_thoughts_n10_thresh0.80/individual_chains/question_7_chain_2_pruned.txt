Okay, so I have this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex can be colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the octagon is regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal. So, it has rotational symmetry. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability, so each color has a 1/2 chance for each vertex.

The key here is that after some rotation, all blue vertices must align with the original red positions. So, for a given coloring, we need to check if there's a rotation (by some multiple of 45 degrees, since an octagon has 8 sides) that maps the blue vertices to where the red ones were.

Wait, but actually, the problem is about the probability that such a rotation exists. So, we're looking for colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Since the octagon is regular, the red and blue sets must be rotations of each other.

Let me think about how many such colorings exist. Maybe I should consider the group of rotations of the octagon, which is the cyclic group of order 8. So, for each coloring, we can rotate it by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, and see if any of these rotations map the blue vertices to the red ones.

But how does this apply? Let's denote the original coloring as C. For each rotation r, we can check if r(C_blue) = C_red. Since both C_blue and C_red are subsets of the octagon's vertices, the condition is that C_blue is the image of C_red under some rotation r.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since the octagon has rotational symmetry, this would imply that the number of blue and red vertices must be the same, right? Because if you rotate the blue set, you just permute the positions, so the count remains the same. So, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices.

Wait, but each vertex is colored red or blue independently. So,
