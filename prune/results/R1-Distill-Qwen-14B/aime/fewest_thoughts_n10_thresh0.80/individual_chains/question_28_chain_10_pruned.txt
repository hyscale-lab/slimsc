Okay, I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths. The goal is to find the distance from a special point inside the tetrahedron, called I, to each of its faces. This point I is such that all its distances to the faces are equal, which I think means it's the incenter of the tetrahedron, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance is given in a specific form, and I need to find m + n + p where the distance is m√n / p.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths. AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. So, the edge lengths come in pairs. That seems symmetrical. I wonder if the tetrahedron is isosceles or something like that.

Hmm, in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, it might have some properties similar to a parallelepiped, but not exactly. Maybe it's a kind of 'balanced' tetrahedron.

I remember that in such cases, the inradius can be found by the formula: 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume and the surface area.

Wait, but since all the faces are triangles, the surface area S will be the sum of the areas of each of the four triangular faces.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the areas of each triangular face (they should all be congruent? Wait, not necessarily. Let me check.)

Wait, but no, the edges aren't all equal, just in pairs. So, each face is a triangle with two sides from one pair and one from another, or maybe each face has edges of different lengths.

Wait, let's list all the edges:

AB = √41

BC = √89

CD = √41

DA = √89

AC = √80

BD = √80

So, each face has edges from different pairs.

Wait, let's think about the faces.

Faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.

Face ABC: AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80

Face ABD: AB = √41, BD = √80, AD = √89

Face ACD: AC = √80, CD = √41, AD = √89

Face BCD: BC = √89, CD = √41, BD = √80

So, all four faces are triangles with sides √41, √80, √89. Wait, that's interesting. So, all four faces are congruent triangles?

If that's the case, then all four faces have the same area. That would make things easier.

So, maybe I can compute the area of one face and then multiply by four to get the total surface area S.

Let me verify if all four faces are congruent.
