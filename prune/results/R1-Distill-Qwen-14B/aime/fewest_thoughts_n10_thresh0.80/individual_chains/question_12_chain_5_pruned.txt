Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways there are to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that when you read the numbers left to right in each row, their sum is 999, and when you read the numbers top to bottom in each column, their sum is 99. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Let's label the cells as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So the top row is a, b, c and the bottom row is d, e, f. 

Now, the problem states two conditions:

1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right (so the top row and the bottom row) is 999. That means, the number formed by a, b, c plus the number formed by d, e, f equals 999.

2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom in each column equals 99. So, the number formed by a and d is a two-digit number (since each column has two cells), same with b and e, and c and f. The sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I get the second condition right. Each column has two digits, so top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So column 1 is ad, column 2 is be, column 3 is cf. The sum of these three numbers is 99.

But wait, in the example given, the grid is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

So the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999, which satisfies the first condition. Then, each column:

First column: 0 and 9, so 09 or 90? Wait, no. Wait, when you read top to bottom, each column is a two-digit number, right? So column 1 is '0' and '9' which makes 09 or 90? Hmm, but in the example, the sum is 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Wait, how does that happen? Let me see.

Wait, in the example, the columns are:

First column: 0 (top) and 9 (bottom). So it's a two-digit number 09? But 09 is 9. Second column: 0 and 9, which is 09 (9). Third column: 8 and 1, which is 81. So 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. That's correct.

So each column is a two-digit number where the top digit is the first digit and the bottom is the second. So the first column is 10*a + d, no wait: 'a' is the top, 'd' is the bottom, so it's 10*a +
