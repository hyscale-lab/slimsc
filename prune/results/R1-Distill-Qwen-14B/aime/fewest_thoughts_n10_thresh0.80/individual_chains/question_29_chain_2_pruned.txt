Okay, so I have this geometry problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, all four points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given side lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I'm supposed to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me visualize this first. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So BC is 16, which means AD is also 16. AB is 107, so CD is 107 as well. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, so FG=17 means EH is 17, and EF=184 means GH is 184.

Points D, E, C, F being collinear probably means that they lie on a straight line in that order or some other order. I should draw a rough sketch to get a better idea.

Let me sketch rectangle ABCD. Let me label the vertices in order: A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, D at the top left. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, perhaps the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F? Or maybe another order. I'm not sure yet.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So these four points must be concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.

Wait, A is a corner of rectangle ABCD, D is another corner. H is a corner of EFGH, and G is another corner. So, perhaps the circle passes through A, D, H, G. Since A and D are from ABCD, and H and G are from EFGH, there's some connection here.

Maybe the rectangles are arranged in such a way that one side is along the same line, the line through D, E, C, F. So, perhaps the line is the base or the top of both rectangles?

Let me try to figure out the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC=16, AB=107, so AD is 16, and AB is 107.

Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths. So, if AB is 107, then BC is 16, meaning that the height is 16 and the width is 107. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0), B at (107,16), and A at (0,16). Wait, no, that can't be because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths. Wait, actually, if AD is 16, then since D is at (0,0), A would be at (0,16), and then B would be at (107,16), C at (107,0). Yeah, that makes sense.

So, points:
- D: (0,0)
- C: (107, 0)
- B: (107, 16)
- A: (0, 16)

Now, rectangle EFGH has FG=17 and EF=184. So, sides FG=17 and EH=17, EF=184 and GH=184. So, EFGH is a rectangle that is longer horizontally if EF is 184.

Since points D, E, C, F are collinear, let's see where E and F can be. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0
