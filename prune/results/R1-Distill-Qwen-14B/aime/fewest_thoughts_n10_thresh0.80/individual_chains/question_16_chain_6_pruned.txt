Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p squared divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m with the same property. 

I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue are important here. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod p². So, I'm looking for primes where the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution.

I think I should start by considering small primes and checking whether n⁴ +1 can be divisible by p² for some n. Let's list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Let me check p=2 first. If p=2, then p²=4. So, does there exist an n such that n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod 4?

Compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1: 1⁴=1, 1+1=2 mod4, which is not 0. n=2: 0⁴=0, 0+1=1 mod4. n=3: 3⁴=81≡1 mod4, 1+1=2 mod4. So for p=2, no n exists such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 is not the prime we're looking for.

Next, p=3. p²=9. Let's check n=1: 1+1=2 mod9, not 0. n=2: 16 +1=17≡8 mod9. n=3: 81+1=82≡1 mod9. n=4: 256 +1=257≡257-27*9=257-243=14≡5 mod9. n=5: 625 +1=626≡626-69*9=626-621=5 mod9. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me compute each n⁴ mod9.

Wait, n=0 mod3: n=3k, n⁴=81k⁴≡0 mod9, so n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod9, which isn't 0. For n not divisible by 3, let's compute n⁴ mod9. Since n can be 1,2,4,5,7,8 mod9. Let's compute their fourth powers:

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9 → 1+1=2≠0.
n=2: 2⁴=16≡7 mod9 →7+1=8≠0.
n=4: 4⁴= (4²)²=16²≡7²=49≡4 mod9 →4+1=5≠0.
n=5: 5⁴ = (5²)²=25²≡7²=49≡4 mod9 →4+1=5≠0.
n=7: 7⁴= (7²)²=49²≡4²=16≡7 mod9 →7+1=8≠0.
n=8: 8⁴= (8²)²=64²≡1²=1 mod9 →1+1=2≠0.
So, n⁴ +1 is never 0 mod9. Therefore, p=3 is also not the prime we're looking for.

Next prime is p=5. p²=25. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for various n. Maybe it's faster to find whether -1 is a quartic residue mod25.

Alternatively, I remember that if p is a prime where p ≡1 mod8, then -1 is a quartic residue. Let's check if 5 ≡1 mod8. 5 mod8 is 5, so no. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, I can check n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24 (since 25 is the modulus). Maybe it's tedious, but perhaps I can find a pattern.

Alternatively, note that the multiplicative group mod25 is cyclic of order φ(25)=20. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. Let's see, the order of the group is 20, so the equation x⁴ = -1 is equivalent to x^8 = 1. So, the solutions are elements of order dividing 8. Since 8 divides 20, there should be solutions.

Wait, but to find if -1 is a quartic residue, we can check if (-1)^ ( (p-1)/4 ) ≡1 mod p. Wait, but that's in the field mod p, not mod p². Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 12 (since beyond that, the residues repeat). Let's compute:

n=1: 1⁴=1 →1+1=2 mod25.
n=2: 16 →16+1=17.
n=3: 81 mod2
