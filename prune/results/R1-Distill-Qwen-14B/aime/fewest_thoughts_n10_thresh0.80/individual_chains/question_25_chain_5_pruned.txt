Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, alright, let me break this down.

First, let's list out the information given. There are 900 residents in total. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and every single resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's four different items, and each resident has at least the candy hearts. Interesting.

Now, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But I'm supposed to find out how many own all four. Okay, so it's about overlapping sets and inclusion-exclusion principles.

I remember that the inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding up individual sets, subtracting the intersections, adding back the intersections of three, and so on. But here, the problem isn't directly giving the union; instead, it's telling me about the number of people who have exactly two or exactly three items.

Wait, so let's think. Each resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are like a universal set here. So, any ownership of the other items is in addition to the candy hearts. Hmm, that might simplify things a bit because everyone has the candy hearts. So, when we talk about someone owning two things, it's the candy hearts plus one other, or two others?

Wait, no. The problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, that's an additional item. So, the four things are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, every resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, when someone owns exactly two of these things, it could be the candy hearts plus one of the others, or two of the others but not the candy hearts? No, wait, no. Because they must own the candy hearts, so exactly two would mean candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others, and all four would be candy hearts plus all three other items.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

Each resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, candy hearts are mandatory. So, if someone owns exactly two of the four, that includes the candy hearts and one more. Similarly, exactly three includes candy hearts and two others, and exactly four includes all three others plus the candy hearts.

So, the total number of residents is 900. Let me denote the four items as follows:

- D: diamond ring
- G: golf clubs
- S: garden spade
- C: candy hearts (which everyone has)

So, each resident has at least C. So, the other three can be present or not.

We are told:

- Number of people owning exactly two items: 437
- Number of people owning exactly three items: 234

And we need to find the number of people owning all four items.

Wait, but since C is mandatory, the number of people owning exactly k items is the number of people owning C plus (k-1) other items. So, if someone owns exactly two items, it's C plus one other. Exactly three items is C plus two others. And exactly four is C plus all three others.

So, the counts of exactly two, three, and four are all about how many of the other three items they have.

Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula is:

Total = |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| +
