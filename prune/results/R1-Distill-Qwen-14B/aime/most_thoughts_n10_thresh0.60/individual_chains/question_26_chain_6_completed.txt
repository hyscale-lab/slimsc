Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We're given a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. That means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We need to find the length AP, given that AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, let's start by drawing the triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Since the sides are all different, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle passing through all three points.

Now, the tangents at B and C meet at D. From what I remember, the point where two tangents meet outside a circle is called the external homothety center or something like that. Also, D is the ex-pole of BC with respect to the circle. Hmm, not sure if that term is correct, but I think it relates to pole and polar concepts.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, I know that BD and CD are tangents from D to the circle ω. So, from point D, there are two tangent segments to the circle, which are equal in length, right? So, BD = CD. That might be useful later.

Next, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with the circle. So, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P.

I need to find the length AP. Hmm. So, perhaps I can use some properties related to power of a point, harmonic division, or maybe something with similar triangles.

Let me recall that the power of a point D with respect to circle ω is equal to the square of the tangent from D to ω. Since BD and CD are tangents, the power of D is BD² = CD². Also, power can be expressed as DB * DC, but since DB = DC, it's just DB².

Wait, but the power of point D with respect to ω is also equal to DB² = DC². So, that's consistent.

Now, the line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so by the power of point D, we have:

DA * DP = DB²

So, DA * DP = DB².

Since we're looking for AP, which is DP - DA or DA - DP, depending on the direction. Wait, actually, AP is the length from A to P, so if we have AD, then AP = AD - DP or DP - AD, depending on where P is relative to D.

Wait, no. Let me think. Point A is on the circle, so when we draw AD, starting from A, it goes through D and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the order on the line AD is A, then P, then D. So, AP is the distance from A to P, and PD is the distance from P to D. So, AD = AP + PD.

So, from the power of point D, we have:

DA * DP = DB²

Which is:

(AD) * (DP) = DB²

But AD = AP + PD, so substituting,

(AP + DP) * DP = DB²

Hmm, that leads to (AP + DP) * DP = DB².

But this seems a bit complicated because we have two variables, AP and DP. Is there a better way to express this?

Wait, maybe instead, let's express it as:

DA * DP = DB²

So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, if I let AP = x, then PD would be DA - x. Wait, no, because if A is between P and D, then PD = AD - AP. Wait, no, if P is between A and D, then PD = AD - AP.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to parametrize it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write DA = AP + PD. So, DA = AP + PD.

Then, the power of D is DA * DP = DB².

So, substituting, (AP + PD) * PD = DB².

But I have two variables here, AP and PD. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express PD as something else.

Wait, another approach: maybe use coordinates or trigonometry. But since this is a circle, maybe using inversion or harmonic division could help, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.

Wait, perhaps using power of a point is the way to go. Let's think.

First, I need to find DB. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, and BD = CD.

So, let me compute DB. To compute DB, I can use the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle.

The formula is DB = DC = sqrt(DO² - r²), where DO is the distance from D to the center O of the circle, and r is the radius.

But maybe that's a bit complicated because I don't know where D is located.

Alternatively, maybe I can use triangle properties. Since ABC is a triangle with sides 5, 9, 10, perhaps I can compute its area, circumradius, and then find DB.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC first using Heron's formula.

The sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

Compute the semi-perimeter, s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, area = sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12(12 -5)(12 -9)(12 -10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[12*7*6] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] Wait, 504 factors: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not an integer. Maybe another factor.

Wait, 504 = 7 * 72 = 7 * 9 * 8 = 7 * 9 * 8. So, sqrt(7 * 9 * 8) = 3 * sqrt(7*8) = 3*sqrt(56) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). So, area is 6√14.

Okay, so area K = 6√14.

Now, the circumradius R of triangle ABC can be computed using the formula:

R = (AB * BC * AC) / (4 * K)

So, R = (5 * 9 * 10) / (4 * 6√14) ) = (450) / (24√14) = (75) / (4√14) )

Simplify that by rationalizing the denominator:

R = 75/(4√14) = (75√14)/(4*14) ) = (75√14)/56.

So, R = 75√14 / 56.

Okay, so now, the distance from D to the center O is something we might need, but perhaps it's too involved.

Wait, another approach: the distance from D to O can be found using triangle properties.

Wait, D is the ex-pole of BC. Because tangents at B and C meet at D, so D lies on the polar of BC.

Wait, maybe not necessary. Alternatively, since BD and CD are tangents, and ABC is inscribed in ω, then BD = CD, and angle BDC is equal to the angle BAC. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, angle between two tangents from D is equal to the angle subtended by the chord BC at the center. Hmm, no, that's not exactly right.

Wait, in circle ω, the angle between the tangents from D is equal to twice the angle at the center for the arc BC. Wait, no, the angle at D is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the measure of arc BAC.

Wait, let me recall, the angle between two tangents from an external point D is equal to the measure of the arc BC that's opposite to the angle. Specifically, angle BDC is equal to the measure of arc BAC.

Wait, yes, because the angle between two tangents is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc. So, angle BDC = measure of arc BAC.

Hmm, so if I can find measure of arc BAC, then I can find angle BDC.

But I don't know the measure of arc BAC. Alternatively, maybe I can relate it to the central angles.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC to find angles, then relate them to the arcs.

Let me compute angle BAC. Using the Law of Cosines:

cos(angle BAC) = (AB² + AC² - BC²) / (2 * AB * AC)

So, cos(angle BAC) = (5² + 10² - 9²) / (2 * 5 * 10) = (25 + 100 - 81) / 100 = (44)/100 = 11/25.

So, angle BAC = arccos(11/25). Let's compute its measure:

But maybe I don't need the exact measure. Instead, the measure of arc BAC is twice angle BAC because in the circle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. So, measure of arc BAC = 2 * angle BAC.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the measure of an arc is equal to the central angle subtending it. The angle at the center is twice the inscribed angle. So, angle BAC is an inscribed angle subtended by arc BC. So, angle BAC = (1/2) * measure of arc BC.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So, angle BAC is half the measure of arc BC. Therefore, measure of arc BC = 2 * angle BAC.

Hmm, but we have angle BDC, which is equal to the measure of arc BAC. Wait, no, angle BDC is equal to the measure of the arc that's opposite to D, which is arc BAC. Because when two tangents are drawn from D, the angle between them is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc, but on the opposite side.

Wait, I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me recall the exact theorem.

When two tangents are drawn from an external point D to a circle, the angle between these two tangents (angle BDC) is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the measure of the central angle subtended by arc BC.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the angle between the tangents. The angle between two tangents from D is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the measure of the arc BC. So, angle BDC = 180° - measure of arc BC.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps angle BDC is equal to the measure of the arc BAC. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the properties of the polar line. Since D lies outside the circle and BD and CD are tangents, the polar of D is the line BC.

Wait, yes, the polar of D with respect to ω is BC because D lies on the tangents at B and C. So, the polar of D is BC.

Given that, point A lies on ω, and line AD intersects ω again at P. So, maybe there's a harmonic division or something related.

Alternatively, perhaps use inversion with respect to the circle ω. Inversion might simplify things, but I'm not very familiar with inversion techniques.

Alternatively, maybe use power of a point. Let's see.

We have point D outside the circle, and DA * DP = DB².

But we need to find AP, which is part of DA and DP.

Wait, maybe I can find DA first, and then express DP in terms of DA, and then solve for AP.

So, if I can compute DA, which is the distance from D to A, then I can set up the equation DA * DP = DB², and since AP = DA - DP (if P is between A and D), then I can write DP = DA - AP.

Wait, let's denote AP = x. Then DP = DA - x (since P is between A and D). Substituting into the power of point equation:

DA * (DA - x) = DB²

Which gives DA² - DA * x = DB².

So, rearranged, DA² - DB² = DA * x

So, x = (DA² - DB²) / DA

Hmm, if I can compute DA and DB, then I can find x, which is AP.

So, how can I find DA and DB?

Well, DB is the length of the tangent from D to ω. We know that DB² = DC² = power of D w.r. to ω = DO² - R², where O is the center.

But I don't know the location of D, so perhaps this is not the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can find DB in terms of the sides of the triangle ABC.

Wait, another approach: Let me use coordinates. Let me place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system and compute the coordinates of D, then find DA, and then use the power of point equation.

Let me try that.

Let me set point C at the origin (0,0). Let me set point A at (10, 0), since AC =10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. We know AB=5, BC=9, so let's find the coordinates of point B.

So, coordinates:

C = (0,0)

A = (10, 0)

Let B = (x, y), which we need to find.

We know that AB = 5, so the distance between A(10,0) and B(x,y) is 5:

√[(x -10)^2 + (y -0)^2] =5 → (x -10)^2 + y^2 =25 ...(1)

Also, BC =9, so distance between B(x,y) and C(0,0) is 9:

√[x^2 + y^2] =9 → x² + y² =81 ...(2)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

x² + y² - [(x-10)^2 + y^2] =81 -25

Expand (x-10)^2: x² -20x +100

So,

x² + y² - (x² -20x +100 + y²) =56

Simplify:

x² + y² -x² +20x -100 - y² =56

So, 20x -100 =56 → 20x =156 → x=156/20 = 39/5 =7.8

So, x=7.8, which is 39/5.

Then, substitute x=39/5 into equation (2):

(39/5)^2 + y² =81

Compute (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521, so 1521/25 + y²=81

So, y² =81 -1521/25 = (2025/25 -1521/25) = (504)/25

Thus, y= sqrt(504/25)= (sqrt(504))/5= (sqrt(16*31.5))/5= (4*sqrt(31.5))/5. Wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. Yes. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5). But 31.5=63/2, so sqrt(31.5)=sqrt(63/2)= (3*sqrt(14))/sqrt(2) )= (3*sqrt(28))/2= (3*2*sqrt(7))/2= 3√7. Wait, no:

Wait, 31.5 is 63/2. So, sqrt(63/2) = (sqrt(63))/sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(7))/sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(14))/2. Because sqrt(7)/sqrt(2) is sqrt(7/2) which is sqrt(14)/2.

So, sqrt(31.5)=sqrt(63/2)= (3*sqrt(14))/2.

So, y= (4)*(3*sqrt(14)/2)/5= (12 sqrt(14)/2)/5= (6 sqrt(14))/5.

So, point B has coordinates (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates:

A: (10,0)

B: (39/5, 6√14/5)

C: (0,0)

Now, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

To find D, I can compute the equations of the tangents at B and C, then find their intersection.

First, let me compute the equation of the tangent at C.

Since C is (0,0), the tangent at C can be found using the formula for the tangent to a circle at a given point.

But to do that, I need the equation of the circle ω passing through A, B, C.

Wait, let's find the equation of the circumcircle ω.

We have three points: A(10,0), B(39/5,6√14/5), C(0,0).

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.

Since the circle passes through C(0,0):

0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 → c=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy =0.

Now, plug in point A(10,0):

10² +0 + 2g(10) + 0 =0 → 100 +20g=0 → 20g= -100 → g= -5.

So, equation is x² + y² -10x + 2fy =0.

Now, plug in point B(39/5,6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + 2f*(6√14/5) =0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25

-10*(39/5)= -78

2f*(6√14/5)= (12√14 f)/5

So, putting it all together:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (12√14 f)/5 =0

Combine the first two terms:

(1521 +504)/25 =2025/25=81.

So, 81 -78 + (12√14 f)/5 =0 → 3 + (12√14 f)/5=0 → (12√14 f)/5= -3 → f= (-3 *5)/(12√14)= (-15)/(12√14)= (-5)/(4√14).

Rationalize the denominator:

f= (-5)/(4√14) * (√14/√14)= (-5√14)/(4*14)= (-5√14)/56.

So, f= -5√14/56.

Thus, the equation of the circle ω is:

x² + y² -10x + 2*(-5√14/56)y =0 → x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y=0.

Simplify:

x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Okay, now that I have the equation of the circle, I can find the equation of the tangent at point C(0,0). Since C is on the circle, the tangent at C can be found using the formula for the tangent at (x₁,y₁):

xx₁ + yy₁ + g(x + x₁) + f(y + y₁) + c =0.

Wait, but in the general equation, for a circle x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c=0, the tangent at (x₁,y₁) is xx₁ + yy₁ + g(x +x₁) + f(y + y₁) + c=0.

Wait, let me confirm.

I think the tangent at (x₁,y₁) is given by T: xx₁ + yy₁ + g(x +x₁) + f(y + y₁) + c=0.

Since c=0 in our case, the equation becomes:

x*x₁ + y*y₁ + g(x +x₁) + f(y + y₁)=0.

At point C(0,0):

x*0 + y*0 + g(x +0) + f(y +0)=0 → gx + fy =0.

So, the tangent at C is gx + fy=0.

Given that g= -5, f= -5√14/56.

So, equation is (-5)x + (-5√14/56)y=0 → -5x - (5√14/56)y=0 → Multiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:

-280x -5√14 y=0 → 280x +5√14 y=0.

Divide both sides by 5:

56x +√14 y=0.

So, the tangent at C is 56x +√14 y=0.

Similarly, let's find the equation of the tangent at B.

Point B is (39/5,6√14/5).

Using the same tangent formula:

xx₁ + yy₁ + g(x +x₁) + f(y + y₁) =0.

Substituting x₁=39/5, y₁=6√14/5, g= -5, f= -5√14/56.

So, equation is:

x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-5)(x +39/5) + (-5√14/56)(y +6√14/5) =0.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (39/5)x

Second term: (6√14/5)y

Third term: -5x -5*(39/5)= -5x -39

Fourth term: (-5√14/56)y + (-5√14/56)*(6√14/5)

Compute the fourth term:

(-5√14/56)*(6√14/5)= (-5*6*(√14)^2)/(56*5)= (-30*14)/(280)= (-420)/280= -1.5= -3/2.

So, putting it all together:

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5√14/56)y -3/2=0.

Combine like terms.

First, terms with x:

(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x= (14/5)x.

Terms with y:

(6√14/5)y + (-5√14/56)y.

Let me compute 6/5 -5/56 in terms of √14.

6/5 = (6*56)/(5*56)= 336/280.

5/56= (5*5)/(5*56)= 25/280.

Wait, no. Wait, it's 6√14/5 and -5√14/56.

So, factor out √14:

√14 [6/5 -5/56] y.

Compute 6/5 -5/56:

Find a common denominator, which is 280.

6/5 = (6*56)/280= 336/280.

5/56= (5*5)/280=25/280.

So, 6/5 -5/56= (336 -25)/280= 311/280.

So, the terms with y: √14*(311/280)y.

Constant terms:

-39 -3/2 = -39 -1.5= -40.5= -81/2.

So, putting it all together:

(14/5)x + √14*(311/280)y -81/2 =0.

This is the equation of the tangent at B.

Now, we have the two tangents: tangent at C is 56x +√14 y=0, and tangent at B is (14/5)x + (√14*311/280)y -81/2=0.

We need to find their intersection point D.

So, let me write the equations:

1) 56x +√14 y=0

2) (14/5)x + (311√14/280)y =81/2

Let me solve these two equations for x and y.

From equation 1, we can express y in terms of x.

From equation 1:

√14 y = -56x → y= (-56x)/√14.

Simplify:

y= (-56x)/√14 = (-56/√14) x.

Simplify 56/√14:

56/√14 = (56√14)/14= 4√14.

So, y= -4√14 x.

So, y= -4√14 x.

Now, substitute this into equation 2.

Equation 2:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)y =81/2.

Substitute y= -4√14 x:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)*(-4√14 x) =81/2.

Compute each term.

First term: (14/5)x.

Second term: (311√14/280)*(-4√14 x) = (-4*311*(√14)^2)/(280) x.

Compute (√14)^2=14.

So, second term: (-4*311*14)/280 x = (-1676*14)/280 x.

Compute 14/280=1/20, so 1676/20=83.8.

Wait, wait, maybe compute as fractions.

Let me compute:

-4 *311 *14 = -4 *4354= -17416.

Wait, no:

Wait, 4*311=1244; 1244*14=17416. So, it's -17416.

Denominator:280.

So, second term: (-17416)/280 x.

Simplify:

17416 ÷4=4354; 280 ÷4=70.

4354 ÷2=2177; 70 ÷2=35.

So, -17416/280= -2177/35.

So, the second term is (-2177/35) x.

So, equation becomes:

(14/5)x - (2177/35)x =81/2.

Convert 14/5 to 35 denominator:

14/5 = (14*7)/(5*7)=98/35.

So,

98/35 x -2177/35 x =81/2.

Combine terms:

(98 -2177)/35 x =81/2 → (-2079)/35 x =81/2.

So, x= (81/2) * (-35/2079).

Simplify 81 and 2079: 2079 ÷81=25.666... Wait, 81*25=2025, 2079-2025=54. So, 2079=81*25 +54=81*(25 +54/81)=81*(25 + 2/3). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, 2079 ÷ 81: 81*25=2025, 2079-2025=54. 54=81*(2/3). So, 2079=81*(25 + 2/3)=81*(75/3 +2/3)=81*(77/3). So, 2079=81 *77/3.

So, 2079=27*77.

So, 2079=27 *77.

Therefore, x= (81/2)*(-35/2079)= (81/2)*(-35)/(27*77).

Simplify 81 and 27: 81=3*27.

So, (3*27)/2 * (-35)/(27 *77) )= 3/2 * (-35)/(77).

Simplify 35 and 77: 77=7*11, 35=5*7. So, 35/77=5/11.

Thus, x= (3/2)*(-5/11)= (-15)/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Then, y= -4√14 x= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we have coordinates for A, D, and P lies on AD and on ω.

We need to find the coordinates of point P, which is the second intersection of AD with ω.

First, let's find the equation of line AD.

Point A is (10,0), and point D is (-15/22,30√14/11).

Let me compute the slope of AD.

Slope m= (yD - yA)/(xD -xA)= (30√14/11 - 0)/(-15/22 -10)= (30√14/11)/(-15/22 -220/22)= (30√14/11)/(-235/22)= (30√14/11)*( -22/235 )= (30√14*(-22))/(11*235).

Simplify:

30 and 235: 30 and235 have a GCD of 5. So, 30=5*6, 235=5*47.

22 and 11: 22=2*11, so 22/11=2.

So,

(30√14*(-22))/(11*235) = (5*6*√14*(-2*11))/(11*5*47) )= (6*√14*(-2))/47= (-12√14)/47.

So, slope m= -12√14/47.

Now, the equation of line AD is:

y - yA = m(x -xA)

So, y -0= (-12√14/47)(x -10).

So, y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Now, we need to find the intersection of this line with the circle ω, which already passes through A and P.

The circle equation is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y=0.

So, substitute y from the line equation into the circle equation.

So, let's write y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Substitute into circle equation:

x² + [ (-12√14/47 x + 120√14/47 ) ]² -10x - (5√14/28)(-12√14/47 x + 120√14/47 )=0.

Wow, this is going to be complicated. Let's compute each term step by step.

First, compute y²:

y²= [ (-12√14/47 x + 120√14/47 ) ]²

Let me factor out (√14/47):

y= (√14/47)(-12x + 120).

So, y= (√14/47)(-12x +120).

So, y²= (14/47²)(-12x +120)^2= (14/2209)(144x² - 2880x + 14400).

Compute each term:

144x² *14=2016x².

-2880x *14= -40320x.

14400 *14=201600.

So, y²= (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209.

Now, compute the other terms:

x² is x².

-10x is -10x.

Now, compute the last term:

- (5√14/28)(y)= - (5√14/28)( (-12√14/47 x + 120√14/47 )).

Let me compute this:

= -5√14/28 * [ (-12√14/47 x + 120√14/47 ) ]

= -5√14/28 * [ (-12√14 x + 120√14 ) /47 ]

Factor out √14:

= -5√14/28 * [ √14 (-12x +120)/47 ]

= -5√14/28 * √14 (-12x +120)/47

= -5*(14)/28 * (-12x +120)/47

Because √14 * √14=14.

Simplify:

-5*14/(28*47)= -70/(1276)= -35/638.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, 5√14/28 multiplied by √14 is 5*14/28=5/2.

Wait, let me recompute this:

Wait, the term is:

- (5√14/28) * [ (-12√14 x + 120√14 ) /47 ]

Factor out √14 from the numerator inside the brackets:

= - (5√14/28) * [ √14*(-12x +120) /47 ]

= - (5√14 * √14 )/(28*47) * (-12x +120 )

= - (5*14)/(28*47) * (-12x +120 )

Simplify 5*14=70, 28*47=1276.

70/1276=35/638.

So,

= - (35/638) * (-12x +120 )

= (35/638)*(12x -120 )

= (420x -4200)/638.

So, the last term is (420x -4200)/638.

Now, putting all together into the circle equation:

x² + (2016x² -40320x +201600)/2209 -10x + (420x -4200)/638 =0.

Multiply through by 2209*638 to eliminate denominators. Wait, 2209 is 47², and 638=2*11*29. Hmm, 2209 and 638 are co-prime? Let me check:

2209 ÷ 2= no, it's odd.

2209 ÷11: 11*200=2200, 2209-2200=9, not divisible by 11.

2209 ÷29: 29*76=2204, 2209-2204=5→ not divisible.

So, 2209 and 638 are co-prime. So, LCM is 2209*638.

But this will result in very large numbers, which is tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since A is on both the circle and line AD, we can parametrize line AD and find the other intersection point P.

Let me parametrize line AD.

Let me set a parameter t such that when t=0, we are at A(10,0), and t=1, we reach D(-15/22,30√14/11).

So, the parametric equations:

x=10 + t*(-15/22 -10)=10 + t*(-235/22)

y=0 + t*(30√14/11 -0)= t*(30√14/11)

So, x=10 - (235/22)t

y= (30√14/11)t

Now, substitute into the circle equation:

x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y=0.

Substitute x and y:

[10 - (235/22)t]^2 + [ (30√14/11 t)^2 ] -10[10 - (235/22)t ] - (5√14/28)(30√14/11 t )=0

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: [10 - (235/22)t]^2

=100 - 2*10*(235/22) t + (235/22)^2 t²

=100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t²

Simplify:

4700/22=2350/11, 55225/484 remains.

Second term: [ (30√14/11 t)^2 ]= (900*14)/121 t²= 12600/121 t².

Third term: -10[10 - (235/22)t ]= -100 + (2350/22)t= -100 + 1150/11 t.

Fourth term: - (5√14/28)(30√14/11 t )= - (5*30*14)/(28*11) t= - (2100)/(308) t= - (2100 ÷ 28)/(308 ÷28)= -75/11 t.

So, putting all together:

100 - (2350/11)t + (55225/484)t² + 12600/121 t² -100 + (1150/11)t -75/11 t=0.

Simplify term by term.

Constants:

100 -100=0.

t terms:

- (2350/11)t + (1150/11)t -75/11 t = [ (-2350 +1150 -75)/11 ] t = (-1275/11) t.

t² terms:

(55225/484)t² + (12600/121)t².

Convert 12600/121 to 484 denominator:

12600/121 = (12600*4)/484=50400/484.

So, t² terms: (55225 +50400)/484 t²=105625/484 t².

So, overall equation:

105625/484 t² -1275/11 t =0.

Factor out t:

t (105625/484 t -1275/11 )=0.

Solutions are t=0 and t= (1275/11 ) / (105625/484 )= (1275/11 )*(484/105625 ).

Simplify:

1275 and 105625:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 1275 ÷25=51, 105625 ÷25=4225.

Again, 51 and 4225: 4225 ÷51= 83. So, 51*83=4233, which is more than 4225. Hmm, maybe 4225 ÷51= 83 approx.

Wait, 51*83=4233. So, not exact. Maybe 4225=25*169=25*13². 51=3*17. Not much in common.

So, let me compute:

t= (1275/11)*(484/105625 )

Compute 1275 *484= let's compute 1275*484.

1275 *484:

Compute 1275 *400=510000

1275*80=102000

1275*4=5100

Sum all: 510000 +102000=612000 +5100=617100.

Denominator:11 *105625=11*105625.

Compute 105625 ÷11: 11*9600=105600, 105625-105600=25. So, 105625=11*9600 +25=11*9602 + 3. Wait, no, 11*9602=105622, 105625-105622=3. So, 105625=11*9602 +3.

Wait, maybe I should compute 11*105625.

Wait, 105625 *11: 105625*10=1,056,250 +105,625=1,161,875.

So, t=617100 /1,161,875.

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25:

617100 ÷25=24,684

1,161,875 ÷25=46,475.

So, 24,684 /46,475.

Check if they have common factors.

Compute GCD(24684,46475).

Using Euclidean algorithm:

46475 ÷24684=1, remainder=46475-24684=21791.

24684 ÷21791=1, remainder=24684-21791=2893.

21791 ÷2893=7, remainder=21791-7*2893=21791-20251=1540.

2893 ÷1540=1, remainder=1353.

1540 ÷1353=1, remainder=187.

1353 ÷187=7, remainder=1353-7*187=1353-1309=44.

187 ÷44=4, remainder=187-176=11.

44 ÷11=4, remainder=0.

So, GCD is 11.

So, 24,684 ÷11=2244.

46,475 ÷11=4225.

So, t=2244/4225.

Check if 2244 and 4225 have common factors.

4225=65²=5²*13².

2244: 2244 ÷4=561.

561=3*187=3*11*17.

No common factors with 4225. So, t=2244/4225.

Simplify 2244/4225: divide numerator and denominator by 3:

2244 ÷3=748.

4225 ÷3=1407.5? No, wait, 4225 ÷3=1408.333... No, wait, 3*1400=4200, 4225-4200=25, so 4225=3*1408 +1, so no, can't divide by 3.

Wait, 2244 ÷3=748, yes. 4225 ÷3=1408.333, which is not integer. So, no, GCD is 11 only.

So, t=2244/4225.

Wait, 2244 and 4225: 2244=4*561=4*3*11*17.

4225=5²*13².

No common factors except 1. So, t=2244/4225.

So, t=2244/4225.

Wait, but 2244=4*561, 561=3*11*17, 4225=5²*13².

So, yes, no common factors.

So, t=2244/4225.

But this is the parameter value for point P.

Since t=0 is point A, and t=1 is point D, and t=2244/4225 is point P, which is between A and D.

Now, with t=2244/4225, we can find coordinates of P.

Compute x and y.

x=10 - (235/22) t=10 - (235/22)*(2244/4225).

Simplify:

2244 ÷22=102.

So, (235/22)*(2244/4225)=235*(102)/4225.

Compute 102 and4225: 4225 ÷102=41.421... Not integer.

But let's compute 235*102=235*(100+2)=23500 +470=23970.

So, 23970/4225.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 15: 23970 ÷15=1598, 4225 ÷15=281.666 no, 4225 ÷15=281.666? Wait, 15*281=4215, 4225-4215=10, so 4225=15*281 +10, not divisible.

Wait, 23970 ÷5=4794, 4225 ÷5=845.

4794 and845:

845 ÷5=169, 4794 ÷5=958.8, not integer.

Check if 4794 and845 have common factors.

845=5*13².

4794 ÷13= 368.769, not integer.

So, 23970/4225= (23970 ÷15)/(4225 ÷15)=1598/281.666, which is not helpful.

Wait, perhaps 23970/4225= (23970 ÷10)/(4225 ÷10)=2397/422.5, which is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation earlier.

Wait, let me compute (235/22)*(2244/4225 ).

2244 ÷22=102.

So, 235*102=235*(100+2)=23500 +470=23970.

So, 23970/4225.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 15:

23970 ÷15=1598.

4225 ÷15=281.666... Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, 4225=65²= (5*13)^2=5²*13².

23970: 23970=10*2397=10*3*799=10*3*17*47.

So, no common factors with 5²*13².

So, 23970/4225= (23970 ÷5)/(4225 ÷5)=4794/845.

4794 and845:

845=5*13².

4794 ÷13= 368.769, which isn't integer.

So, it can't be reduced further. So, x=10 -23970/4225.

Wait, 10 is 42250/4225.

So, x= (42250 -23970)/4225=18280/4225.

Simplify 18280/4225.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 3656/845.

Check if reducible: 3656 ÷13=281.23, not integer. 845 ÷13=65.

No common factors. So, x=3656/845.

Similarly, compute y= (30√14/11) t= (30√14/11)*(2244/4225).

Simplify:

2244 ÷11=204.

So, y=30√14 *204 /4225.

Compute 30*204=6120.

So, y=6120√14 /4225.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 15: 6120 ÷15=408, 4225 ÷15=281.666... Not helpful.

Wait, 6120 ÷5=1224, 4225 ÷5=845.

So, y=1224√14 /845.

Check if 1224 and845 have common factors.

845=5*13².

1224 ÷13=94.15, not integer.

So, y=1224√14 /845.

So, point P has coordinates (3656/845, 1224√14/845).

Now, we need to find AP.

Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (3656/845, 1224√14/845).

Compute the distance between A and P.

AP= sqrt[ (10 - 3656/845)^2 + (0 -1224√14/845)^2 ]

First, compute 10 - 3656/845.

10=8450/845.

So, 8450 -3656=4794.

So, 8450 -3656=4794 → 4794/845.

So, 10 -3656/845=4794/845.

Similarly, the y-component is -1224√14/845.

So,

AP= sqrt[ (4794/845)^2 + (1224√14 /845)^2 ]

Factor out 1/845²:

AP= (1/845) sqrt(4794² + (1224√14 )² )

Compute 4794² and (1224√14 )².

Compute 4794²:

4794 *4794:

Compute (4800 -6)^2=4800² -2*4800*6 +6²=23040000 -57600 +36=23040000-57600=22982400 +36=22982436.

And (1224√14 )²=1224² *14.

Compute 1224²:

1224 *1224:

Let me compute 1200²=1,440,000.

2*1200*24=2*1200*24=57,600.

24²=576.

So, (1200+24)²=1,440,000 +57,600 +576=1,498,176.

Multiply by14: 1,498,176 *14.

Compute 1,498,176 *10=14,981,760.

1,498,176 *4=5,992,704.

Total:14,981,760 +5,992,704=20,974,464.

So, now, AP= (1/845) sqrt(22982436 +20,974,464 )

Compute 22982436 +20974464=43956900.

So, sqrt(43956900)=6630.

Because 6630²= (6600+30)^2=6600² +2*6600*30 +30²=43,560,000 +396,000 +900=43,956,900.

Yes, that matches.

So, sqrt(43956900)=6630.

Thus, AP=6630 /845.

Simplify 6630 ÷845.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 6630 ÷5=1326, 845 ÷5=169.

So, 1326/169.

Check if reducible.

169=13².

1326 ÷13=102.

So, 1326=13*102.

102=2*3*17.

So, 1326/169= (13*102)/(13²)=102/13.

So, AP=102/13.

Simplify 102 ÷13=7.84615... But as a fraction, it's already reduced.

So, AP=102/13.

Thus, m=102, n=13, which are coprime.

So, m +n=102 +13=115.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{115}


Given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we need to find the length \(AP\) where \(P\) is the second intersection of line \(AD\) with the circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(ABC\). The tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\).

First, we compute the semi-perimeter \(s\) and area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) using Heron's formula:
\[
s = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]
\[
K = \sqrt{12 \times (12 - 5) \times (12 - 9) \times (12 - 10)} = \sqrt{12 \times 7 \times 3 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]

Next, we find the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{5 \times 9 \times 10}{4 \times 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]

We place the triangle in a coordinate system with \(C\) at the origin, \(A\) at \((10, 0)\), and \(B\) at \((\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5})\). Using the coordinates, we find the equations of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) and their intersection point \(D\).

The coordinates of \(D\) are found to be \(\left( -\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11} \right)\). We then find the equation of line \(AD\) and its intersection with the circumcircle \(\omega\).

Using parametric equations and solving for the parameter \(t\), we find the coordinates of point \(P\). The distance \(AP\) is computed using the distance formula, resulting in:
\[
AP = \frac{102}{13}
\]

Thus, \(m = 102\) and \(n = 13\), leading to \(m + n = 115\).

\[
\boxed{115}
\]
