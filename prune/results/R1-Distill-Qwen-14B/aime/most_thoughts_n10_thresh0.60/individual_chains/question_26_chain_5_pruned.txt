Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of AP in triangle ABC. Let me start by understanding the problem and visualizing it.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C to ω intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We’re given the side lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.

Alright, let me recall some geometry concepts that might help here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsymmedian point or the symmedian point? Hmm, wait, the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. But tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. So BD = CD because they are both tangents from D to ω.

So, BD = CD, which means triangle BDC is isoceles with DB = DC. That might come in handy.

Also, since AD intersects ω again at P, maybe I can use power of a point or some properties related to cyclic quadrilaterals.

Wait, power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D should be equal to DB² (since DB is a tangent). Similarly, DC² is also equal to power of D. Since DB = DC, that makes sense.

Power of a point D: DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Because AD is a secant line intersecting ω at A and P, so DA * DP = DB².

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate it to DA and DP, and since I know DA (if I can compute it), I can find DP, and thus AP = DP - DA? Wait, no, AP is the segment from A to P, so AP = AD + DP? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, A is on ω, and P is the other intersection point. So from A, going through D, which is outside the circle, so AP is actually the part from A to P inside the circle, and DP is the part from D to P outside.

Wait, no. If A is on the circle, and D is outside, then AD passes through A and then goes to D. But since P is the other intersection point, AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So AP is part of AD, specifically, AP = length from A to P, and PD is the part from P to D.

So, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DA * DP. So, if I can compute DB, and find DA, then I can solve for DP.

But I don't know DA yet. Wait, but if I can compute DA, then I can find DP = DB² / DA, and then AP = AD - DP? Wait, no, AP is from A to P. But if AD is from A to D, and P is on AD, then AP is part of AD from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, AD = AP + PD. But since PD = DB² / DA, then AD = AP + (DB² / AD). That might form an equation where I can solve for AP.

Wait, maybe let me write the equation:

Power of D: DB² = DA * DP

But DP = AD - AP.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If A is one point on AD, and P is the other intersection, then AP is the distance from A to P, and PD is the distance from P to D. So, AD is equal to AP + PD. So, PD = AD - AP.

Wait, but the power of a point formula is DB² = DA * DP. So, DB² = DA * (AD - AP). Hmm, that could be a way.

Alternatively, maybe I should use coordinate geometry or trigonometry. But perhaps it's better to find some ratios or use similar triangles.

Wait, another approach: since D is the ex-tangent point, perhaps triangle DBC is isoceles, and maybe some properties of triangle ABC can be used with D.

Alternatively, I can use the concept of harmonic division or use inversion, but that might be too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.

Wait, perhaps using power of a point is the way to go here.

Let me first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. Because once I have the circumradius, I can find DB, which is equal to DC.

To compute the circumradius, I can use the formula:

R = (
