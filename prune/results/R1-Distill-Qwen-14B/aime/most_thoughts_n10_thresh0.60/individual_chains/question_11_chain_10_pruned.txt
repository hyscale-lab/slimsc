Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. It says to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers can sometimes be tricky, but let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number z with |z| = 4 can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, it can also be expressed as z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). This polar form might make things easier because multiplying and dividing complex numbers in polar form is straightforward.

So, let's write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since the magnitude becomes 1/4 and the angle becomes negative. That should help simplify the expression.

Now, let's substitute z into the given expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z

Substituting z = 4e^{iθ} and 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ} into the expression:

= (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}

75 * 4 is 300, and 117i * 4 is 468i. So, this becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second part: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

96*(1/4) is 24, and 144i*(1/4) is 36i. So, this becomes (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, putting it all together, the expression is:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression because the problem is asking for the largest possible real part. Let me denote the expression as E:

E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

To find the real part of E, Re(E), I can write each term in terms of cosine and sine, then separate the real and imaginary parts.

First, let's express each term using Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, expanding the first term:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i + 468(-1) sinθ
= 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i

Similarly, expanding the second term:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + ( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i + 36 sinθ (since i^2 = -1)
= 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

Now, adding these two expanded terms together:

First, the real parts:
[300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i
= [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ] i
= (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i

So, putting it all together, the expression E is:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i

But we are interested in the real part of E, which is:

Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, our goal is to maximize Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is C, and the minimum is -C.

Let me compute the amplitude C for Re(E):

Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, A = 324, B = -432.

The amplitude C is sqrt(A^2 + B^2).

Calculating:

C = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2)

First, compute 324 squared. 324 is 18^2 * 1 (since 18*18=324). Wait, 18^2 is 324, so 324^2 is (18^2)^2 = 18^4. Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute:

324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2
= 90000 + 14400 + 576
= 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2 = 160000, 32^2=1024, and 2*400*32=25600.

So, (400+32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2
= 160000 + 25600 + 1024
= 160000 + 25600 = 185600; 185600 + 1024 = 186624.

So,

C = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600)

What's sqrt(291600? Let's see, 291600 = 2916 * 100, so sqrt(2916)*sqrt(100) = sqrt(2916)*10.

What's sqrt(2916)? Let's compute 50^2 = 2500, 54^2=2916. Because 54*54= (50+4)^2=2500 + 400 + 16=2916. So sqrt(2916)=54. Therefore, C=54*10=540.

So, Re(E) can be written as 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of Re(E) is 540, which occurs when cos(θ + φ) = 1.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing C.

Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, A = 324, B
