Okay, so I've got this complex number problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I know that z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. So, |z| = 4. That means if I write z as re^{iθ}, then r would be 4. So, z = 4e^{iθ}, right? Or alternatively, z can be written as 4(cosθ + isinθ). Maybe that parametrization will help later.

Now, the expression given is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. I need to find the largest possible real part of this expression. Let me denote this expression as E. So,

E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

I think I can rewrite E using the fact that |z| = 4, which means z̄ (the conjugate of z) is 4² / z, since z * z̄ = |z|². So, z̄ = 16/z. Wait, let me confirm that: If |z| = r, then z̄ = r² / z. Yes, that's correct. So, since |z| =4, z̄ = 16/z. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet, but maybe.

Alternatively, maybe I can write z as 4e^{iθ} and then compute E in terms of θ. Let me try that approach.

So, let me set z = 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Substituting into E:

E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = (300 + 46
