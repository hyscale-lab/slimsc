Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, is that right? No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they don't necessarily intersect at right angles unless it's a square. Hmm, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals do intersect at right angles. Let me confirm: Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at 90 degrees.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

Given that, I can think of the rhombus as being formed by two pairs of points symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q). But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, but the rhombus is formed by connecting these points in order. So, the order of the points should be such that the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of vectors.

Let me consider the coordinates. Let me denote the coordinates of points as follows: Let A = (a, b), B = (c, d), C = (-a, -b), D = (-c, -d). Because the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, then they must be symmetric about the origin. Similarly, B and D are symmetric.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, etc. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.

Alternatively, since the sides are equal, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should all have the same magnitude.

Let me think about vectors. Vector AB is (c - a, d - b). Vector BC is (-a - c, -b - d). Vector CD is (-c + a, -d + b). Vector DA is (a + c, b + d). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should use the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if AC is a diagonal, and BD is the other diagonal, then the slopes of AC and BD should multiply to -1.

But let's think about the coordinates. Points A and C are (a, b) and (-a, -b), so the diagonal AC has a slope of ( -b - b ) / ( -a - a ) = (-2b)/(-2a) = b/a. Similarly, the diagonal BD goes from (c, d) to (-c, -d), so its slope is (-d - d)/(-c - c) = (-2d)/(-2c) = d/c. So, the product of these two slopes is (b/a)*(d/c). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, this product should be -1. So, (b/a)*(d/c) = -1.

Therefore, (b d)/(a c) = -1. So, b d = -a c.

Hmm, that seems like a useful condition.

Also, since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, their coordinates must satisfy that equation. So, for point A: a²/20 - b²/24 = 1. Similarly, for point B: c²/20 - d²/24 = 1.

So, now I have a system of equations:

1. b d = -a c
2. a²/20 - b²/24 = 1
3. c²/20 - d²/24 = 1

I need to find BD², which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. The length of BD is the distance between points B and D, which are (c, d) and (-c, -d). So, the distance is sqrt[ (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 ] = 2*sqrt(c² + d²). Therefore, BD² is [2 sqrt(c² + d²)]² = 4(c² + d²).

So, BD² = 4(c² + d²). So, I need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD², or rather, the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, I need to find the minimum value of BD², and then the answer would be that minimum value, but since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi, perhaps it's a supremum or something else. Hmm, wait, maybe I need to find the minimum BD² because the question says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, perhaps BD² can be made as close as we like to some lower bound, but not less than that. So, the lower bound is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum. So, if the infimum is m, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is m.

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of the minimum possible BD², so that the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is the infimum, which is the minimum value, if attainable.

So, perhaps I need to find the minimum value of BD², given the constraints.

So, the plan is:

- Express BD² in terms of c and d, which is 4(c² + d²).

- Use the constraints from the hyperbola equation and the perpendicularity condition to find the minimum value of c² + d².

So, let's write down the equations:

From the hyperbola:

a²/20 - b²/24 = 1 => 24a² - 20b² = 240 => 6a² -5b² = 60. Let me note that as equation (2a).

Similarly, 24c² - 20d² = 240 => 6c² -5d² = 60. Equation (3a).

And from the perpendicularity condition: b d = -a c. Equation (1).

So, the variables are a, b, c, d. But we need to express everything in terms of c and d, perhaps.

Wait, let me see if I can express a and b in terms of c and d.

From equation (1): b d = -a c. So, a = (-b d)/c.

Wait, but I can also express a in terms of b from the hyperbola equation.

From equation (2a): 6a² = 60 +5b² => a² = (60 +5b²)/6 = 10 + (5/6)b².

Similarly, from equation (3a): 6c² = 60 +5d² => c² = 10 + (5/6)d².

So, we can write a in terms of b, and c in terms of d.

Let me attempt to express a and c in terms of b and d:

a = sqrt(10 + (5/6)b²) and c = sqrt(10 + (5/6)d²).

But I have to be careful with the signs. Since the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 =1, it's symmetric in all quadrants, so a and c can be positive or negative, but their squares are positive. Since BD² depends on c² and d², signs might not matter here.

But perhaps it's better to square equation (1) to eliminate the square
