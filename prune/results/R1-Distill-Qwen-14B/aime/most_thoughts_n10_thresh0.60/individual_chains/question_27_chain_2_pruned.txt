Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3.

Then there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of the sphere, meaning it's inside the sphere and tangent along a circle. Similarly, it can rest on the outside, tangent along another circle. We need to find the radii of these tangent circles, r_i (inside) and r_o (outside), and then compute r_i - r_o as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to find the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases.

I remember that for a torus, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation) is R = 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is r = 3. But wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, how does the sphere's radius factor into this?

Hmm. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, so the torus is entirely within the sphere. The point of tangency would be where the sphere touches the outer part of the torus.

Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is inside the torus, and the tangency is where the sphere touches the inner part of the torus.

Wait, but how do I find the radii of these tangent circles? Maybe I need to use some geometry involving the sphere and the torus.

Let me think. The sphere has radius 11, so its center is somewhere. When the torus is resting on the inside, the center of the sphere must coincide with the center of the torus, right? Because otherwise, how would it be tangent along a circle?

Wait, the torus's center is the center of the axis around which the circle is revolved. So, the center of the torus is at a point, and the sphere's center must align with that point.

So, the sphere is centered at the same point as the torus's center. Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the maximum distance from the center to any point on the torus must be less than or equal to the sphere's radius. But wait, the torus has points that are further out. Let me think about the distances.

The distance from the center of the torus to any point on the torus can be found using the major and minor radii. The maximum distance is R + r = 6 +
