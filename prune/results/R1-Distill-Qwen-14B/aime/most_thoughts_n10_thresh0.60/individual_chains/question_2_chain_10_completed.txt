Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

We've got three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and point B is on the y-axis, a bit less than halfway to (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ where each PQ is of unit length, lies in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So for each such segment PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p and q positive real numbers, and the distance between them is 1. So, the condition is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, every segment PQ in this family is a line segment connecting (p,0) to (0,q), where p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So, point C is on AB, but not on any other PQ from F. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from O to C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

So, first, I need to figure out the equation of line AB. Once I have that, point C will lie somewhere on AB, and I need to find its coordinates such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB.

So, let me find the equation of AB. Points A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2) respectively.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3).

Using point-slope form, let's write the equation of AB. Let me use point A (1/2, 0).

y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)
So, y = -sqrt(3) x + (sqrt(3)/2)

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, any point C on AB can be parametrized as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, point C is (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for some x between 0 and 1/2, since AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2).

Now, our goal is to find such a C that it's not on any other segment PQ from F except AB. So, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

To rephrase, the point C is the only point on AB that is not covered by any other PQ from F. So, for all other segments PQ, C is not lying on them.

So, perhaps the point C is where the envelope of all these PQ segments touches AB, or maybe where AB is tangent to some envelope.

Wait, the family F consists of all such segments PQ. So, the collection of all these segments form some sort of curve, maybe a circle or something else. The point C would be where AB is tangent to this envelope, so that it only intersects AB at C and doesn't lie on any other PQ.

Alternatively, maybe the point C is such that the line AB is the only PQ that passes through it. So, for other PQs, when we check whether they pass through C, we find that they don't.

But how can we determine this?

Another approach: For the point C = (x, y) on AB, we can write the equation of PQ in F that passes through C. If C lies on more than one PQ, then it's on multiple segments. But we need C such that it only lies on PQ which is AB itself.

So, we can find the equation for PQ given that it passes through C, and then check if the only PQ that passes through C is AB.

But perhaps a better approach is to find the envelope of the family of lines PQ.

Let me think: Each PQ is a segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² =1. So, the equation of line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1, since it's the intercept form of the line equation.

So, the family of lines is x/p + y/q =1, with p² + q² =1.

But since we have the constraint p² + q² =1, we can parameterize p and q. Let's let p = cosθ and q = sinθ, where θ is in the first quadrant since p and q are positive.

So, the equation of PQ becomes x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) =1.

So, the family of lines is x secθ + y cscθ =1 for θ in (0, π/2).

Now, the envelope of this family is the curve that is tangent to each of these lines. The envelope can be found using the method of solving for θ where the line is tangent to the curve.

The formula for the envelope is found by solving the system:

x secθ + y cscθ =1

and

d/dθ (x secθ + y cscθ -1) =0

So, compute the derivative with respect to θ:

d/dθ (x secθ + y cscθ -1 ) = x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ = 0

So, x secθ tanθ = y cscθ cotθ

Let me write that:

x (secθ tanθ) = y (cscθ cotθ)

Express all terms in sin and cos.

secθ = 1/cosθ, tanθ = sinθ / cosθ

cscθ = 1/sinθ, cotθ = cosθ / sinθ

Plugging in:

x [ (1/cosθ)(sinθ / cosθ) ) ] = y [ (1/sinθ)(cosθ / sinθ) ) ]

Simplify:

x (sinθ / cos²θ ) = y (cosθ / sin²θ )

Multiply both sides by cos²θ sin²θ to eliminate denominators:

x sin³θ = y cos³θ

So, x sin³θ = y cos³θ

Therefore, (x/y) = (cos³θ)/(sin³θ) = (cotθ)^3

So, cotθ = (x/y)^(1/3)

Let me write that as:

cotθ = (x/y)^(1/3)

But from the original equation, x secθ + y cscθ =1.

Express secθ and cscθ in terms of sinθ and cosθ:

x / cosθ + y / sinθ =1

Let me denote t = θ for simplicity.

So, x / cos t + y / sin t =1

And we have cot t = (x/y)^(1/3). Let's solve for t in terms of x and y.

Express cot t = (x/y)^(1/3). So, cot t = (x/y)^{1/3}

We can write this as (cos t)/(sin t) = (x/y)^{1/3}

So, cos t = (x/y)^{1/3} sin t

Let me square both sides to use the identity cos²t + sin²t =1.

cos²t = (x/y)^{2/3} sin²t

So, [1 - sin²t] = (x/y)^{2/3} sin²t

Bring all terms to one side:

1 = (x/y)^{2/3} sin²t + sin²t = sin²t [ (x/y)^{2/3} +1 ]

So,

sin²t = 1 / [ (x/y)^{2/3} +1 ]

Similarly,

cos²t = (x/y)^{2/3} sin²t = (x/y)^{2/3} / [ (x/y)^{2/3} +1 ]

So, cos t = sqrt( (x/y)^{2/3} / [ (x/y)^{2/3} +1 ] )

Similarly, sin t = 1 / sqrt( (x/y)^{2/3} +1 )

But perhaps another approach is better. Let's express sin t and cos t in terms of x and y. Let's denote that.

Wait, let me substitute from cot t = (x/y)^{1/3} into the original equation.

So, from cot t = (x/y)^{1/3}, we have tan t = (y/x)^{1/3}

So, tan t = (y/x)^{1/3}

So, sin t = tan t / sqrt(1 + tan²t) = (y/x)^{1/3} / sqrt(1 + (y/x)^{2/3})

Similarly, cos t = 1 / sqrt(1 + (y/x)^{2/3})

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can express in terms of u = (x/y)^{1/3}

Let me let u = (x/y)^{1/3}, so u^3 = x/y => y = x / u^3

Then, from the original equation:

x sec t + y csc t =1

Express sec t and csc t in terms of u.

But we have tan t = u, so sec t = sqrt(1 + u²), and csc t = 1 / sin t = sqrt(1 + u²)/u

Wait, let me think. If tan t = u, then sin t = u / sqrt(1 + u²), and cos t = 1 / sqrt(1 + u²)

So, sec t = 1 / cos t = sqrt(1 + u²)

csc t = 1 / sin t = sqrt(1 + u²)/u

So, plug into the equation:

x sqrt(1 + u²) + y (sqrt(1 + u²)/u ) =1

Factor out sqrt(1 + u²):

sqrt(1 + u²) [x + y / u ] =1

But remember that y = x / u^3, so substitute that:

sqrt(1 + u²) [x + (x / u^3) / u ] =1

Simplify inside the brackets:

x + (x / u^4) = x (1 + 1/u^4 ) = x (1 + u^{-4}) = x (u^4 +1)/u^4

So, equation becomes:

sqrt(1 + u²) * x (u^4 +1)/u^4 =1

Express x in terms of u:

x = [1] / [ sqrt(1 + u²) * (u^4 +1)/u^4 ]

Simplify:

x = u^4 / [ sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1) ]

Similarly, since y = x / u^3, then:

y = [ u^4 / ( sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1) ) ] / u^3 = u / ( sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1) )

So, now, we have x and y in terms of u.

But point C is on AB, so it must satisfy y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

So, substituting x and y:

u / ( sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1) ) = -sqrt(3) [ u^4 / ( sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1) ) ] + sqrt(3)/2

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1) to eliminate denominators:

u = -sqrt(3) u^4 + (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1 )

Hmm, this seems complicated, but let's try to rearrange it.

Bring all terms to one side:

u + sqrt(3) u^4 = (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1 )

Let me denote s = sqrt(1 + u²). Then, s² = 1 + u², so s² - u² =1.

But maybe not helpful yet.

Alternatively, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root.

But first, let me write the equation as:

u + sqrt(3) u^4 = (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1 )

Let me divide both sides by sqrt(3):

(u)/sqrt(3) + u^4 = (1/2) sqrt(1 + u²) (u^4 +1 )

Now, let me denote left side as A and right side as B.

A = u/sqrt(3) + u^4

B = (1/2) sqrt(1 + u²)(u^4 +1 )

We can square both sides to eliminate the square root:

A² = B²

So,

(u/sqrt(3) + u^4)^2 = [ (1/2) sqrt(1 + u²)(u^4 +1 ) ]^2

Compute left side:

= (u^4 + u/(sqrt(3)))^2

= u^8 + 2*u^4*(u/(sqrt(3))) + (u/(sqrt(3)))^2

= u^8 + 2 u^5 / sqrt(3) + u² / 3

Right side:

= (1/4)(1 + u²)(u^4 +1 )^2

Expand (u^4 +1)^2:

= u^8 + 2 u^4 +1

So, right side becomes:

(1/4)(1 + u²)(u^8 + 2u^4 +1 )

Multiply (1 + u²)(u^8 + 2u^4 +1 ):

= 1*(u^8 + 2u^4 +1 ) + u²*(u^8 + 2u^4 +1 )

= u^8 + 2u^4 +1 + u^{10} + 2u^6 + u²

So, right side:

= (1/4)(u^{10} + u^8 + 2u^6 + 2u^4 + u² +1 )

So, putting it all together:

Left side: u^8 + (2/sqrt(3)) u^5 + (1/3) u²

Right side: (1/4) (u^{10} + u^8 + 2u^6 + 2u^4 + u² +1 )

Bring all terms to left:

u^8 + (2/sqrt(3)) u^5 + (1/3) u² - (1/4) u^{10} - (1/4) u^8 - (1/2) u^6 - (1/2) u^4 - (1/4) u² - 1/4 = 0

Simplify each term:

- (1/4) u^{10} + [1 - 1/4] u^8 + (2/sqrt(3)) u^5 + [ (1/3) - (1/4) ] u² - (1/2) u^6 - (1/2) u^4 - 1/4 =0

Compute coefficients:

1 - 1/4 = 3/4

(1/3 - 1/4) = (4 -3)/12 = 1/12

So,

- (1/4) u^{10} + (3/4) u^8 - (1/2) u^6 - (1/2) u^4 + (2/sqrt(3)) u^5 + (1/12) u² - 1/4 =0

This is a tenth-degree equation, which is quite complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize u and find a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a point where the envelope touches AB, and that would be our point C.

Wait, the envelope of the family F is the curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, the envelope is the curve that touches each PQ at exactly one point.

So, the envelope is the set of points where each PQ is tangent to it.

So, since AB is one of these PQs (specifically, AB is the segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2 ), which is in F because its length is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4 ) = sqrt(1) =1.

So, AB is one of the PQs in F.

Now, the envelope of F is a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, the point C is where this envelope touches AB, and since AB is already a PQ, perhaps C is the point where the envelope is tangent to AB.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Wait, but AB is a member of F, so the envelope would pass through points on multiple PQs. But the unique point C on AB not on any other PQ would be the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F. Because at that point, AB just touches the envelope, and any other PQ in F would intersect AB elsewhere, but only at C.

Alternatively, maybe the envelope of F is a circle, perhaps the unit circle, but scaled.

Wait, let's think: The family F consists of lines x secθ + y cscθ =1. This is similar to the family of lines tangent to a circle. Because the general equation of a tangent to a circle x² + y² = r² at angle θ is x cosθ + y sinθ = r.

But in our case, the lines are x secθ + y cscθ =1, which can be rewritten as x cosθ + y sinθ = cosθ sinθ.

Wait, no: x secθ + y cscθ =1 is x / cosθ + y / sinθ =1.

Multiply both sides by sinθ cosθ:

x sinθ + y cosθ = sinθ cosθ

So, x sinθ + y cosθ = (sinθ cosθ )

Hmm. The left side is the dot product of (x, y) with (sinθ, cosθ), and the right side is (sinθ cosθ )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps this family of lines is tangent to some conic.

Wait, perhaps we can find the envelope by eliminating θ from the two equations:

x secθ + y cscθ =1

and

d/dθ (x secθ + y cscθ ) =0

Which gives:

x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ =0

So, as I did earlier, leading to x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

So, from this, (x/y) = (cosθ / sinθ)^3

Let me define t = tanθ, so cosθ = 1/sqrt(1 + t²), sinθ = t/sqrt(1 + t²)

So, (x/y) = (1/t)^3 => x/y = 1/t^3 => t^3 = y/x => t = (y/x)^{1/3}

So, tanθ = (y/x)^{1/3}

So, sinθ = (y/x)^{1/3} / sqrt(1 + (y/x)^{2/3} )

And cosθ = 1 / sqrt(1 + (y/x)^{2/3} )

But then, using the original equation, x secθ + y cscθ =1

So, x / cosθ + y / sinθ =1

Substitute cosθ and sinθ:

x * sqrt(1 + (y/x)^{2/3}) + y * sqrt(1 + (y/x)^{2/3}) / (y/x)^{1/3} ) =1

Simplify:

sqrt(1 + (y/x)^{2/3}) [ x + y / (y/x)^{1/3} ] =1

Simplify inside the brackets:

x + y * x^{1/3} y^{-1/3} = x + x^{1/3} y^{2/3}

So,

sqrt(1 + (y/x)^{2/3}) [ x + x^{1/3} y^{2/3} ] =1

Let me factor x^{1/3} from the second term:

Wait, x^{1} is x^{3/3}, and x^{1/3} y^{2/3} is x^{1/3} y^{2/3}

So, factor x^{1/3}:

sqrt(1 + (y/x)^{2/3}) [ x^{1/3} (x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}) ] =1

But (y/x)^{2/3} = (y^{2/3}/x^{2/3}), so 1 + (y/x)^{2/3} = (x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}) / x^{2/3}

So, sqrt( (x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}) / x^{2/3} ) = sqrt( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} ) / x^{1/3}

So, putting it all together:

[ sqrt( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} ) / x^{1/3} ] * [ x^{1/3} (x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}) ] =1

Simplify:

sqrt(x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}) * (x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}) ) =1

So,

(x^{2/3} + y^{2/3})^{3/2} =1

Raise both sides to the 2/3 power:

x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1

So, the envelope is the astroid (x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1 )

So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.

So, the astroid is the envelope of all these PQ segments.

Now, the point C is the point on AB where the astroid is tangent to AB. So, since AB is itself a member of F, the envelope (astroid) should be tangent to AB at point C, and that would be the only point where AB meets the astroid, as AB is a PQ.

But wait, AB is a PQ in F, so the astroid is the envelope, so the astroid should be tangent to AB at point C, which would be the only point where AB meets the astroid.

So, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.

So, to find point C, we can find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

So, the system is:

1. y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2

2. x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 2.

So,

x^{2/3} + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^{2/3} =1

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution.

Let me let u = x^{1/3}, so x = u^3, and x^{2/3}=u².

Similarly, let me compute [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^{2/3}.

First, let's factor sqrt(3):

= [ sqrt(3) ( -x + 1/2 ) ]^{2/3}

= (sqrt(3))^{2/3} * ( -x + 1/2 )^{2/3}

= (3^{1/2})^{2/3} * ( -x + 1/2 )^{2/3}

= 3^{1/3} * ( -x + 1/2 )^{2/3}

So, equation 2 becomes:

u² + 3^{1/3} [ ( -u^3 + 1/2 )^{2/3} ] =1

Hmm, this is still complicated. Maybe I can let v = -u^3 + 1/2, so v = 1/2 - u^3.

Then, (v)^{2/3} = (1/2 - u^3)^{2/3}

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, maybe we can let t = x, and write y in terms of t, then plug into the astroid equation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use calculus to find the point of tangency.

Since AB is tangent to the astroid at C, their slopes must be equal at that point.

So, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). The slope of the astroid at point C must also be -sqrt(3).

So, let's compute the derivative of the astroid equation.

We have x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.

Differentiate both sides with respect to x:

(2/3) x^{-1/3} + (2/3) y^{-1/3} dy/dx =0

Solve for dy/dx:

dy/dx = - [ x^{-1/3} / y^{-1/3} ] = - ( y^{1/3} / x^{1/3} )

So, dy/dx = - ( y^{1/3} ) / ( x^{1/3} )

At point C, this slope must equal -sqrt(3):

- ( y^{1/3} ) / ( x^{1/3} ) = -sqrt(3 )

Cancel the negatives:

( y^{1/3} ) / ( x^{1/3} ) = sqrt(3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

y / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3)

So, y = 3*sqrt(3) x

But wait, point C is on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

So, we have two expressions for y:

1. y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

2. y = 3*sqrt(3) x

Set them equal:

3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

Bring terms together:

3*sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2

(4 sqrt(3) ) x = sqrt(3)/2

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4x = 1/2

So, x = 1/8

Then, y = 3*sqrt(3) * (1/8 ) = 3 sqrt(3)/8

So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

Therefore, OC^2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2.

Compute:

(1/64) + (27/64 ) = (1 +27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16

So, OC² =7/16, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

Wait, but let me check if this is correct.

Wait, when I set y = 3 sqrt(3) x and y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2, solving for x:

3 sqrt(3) x = - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

Bring terms together:

3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2

Which is 4 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4x = 1/2 => x = 1/8

Then, y = 3 sqrt(3)*(1/8 ) = 3 sqrt(3)/8

So, yes, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

Compute OC²: (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Thus, OC² =7/16, so p=7, q=16, so p+q=23.

But wait, the problem states that C is on AB, and the only point on AB not lying on any other PQ in F. So, is this point indeed the only such point?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the point where AB is tangent to the envelope is the point C.

But given that AB is a PQ in F, and the envelope is the astroid, which is tangent to AB at C, so C is the only point where AB meets the astroid, so any other PQ in F would not pass through C.

Wait, but AB is a PQ in F, so the astroid is the envelope, which is tangent to each PQ at exactly one point, which is C for AB.

So, that makes sense.

So, the answer is 7/16, so p + q=23.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{23}


Given points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \), we need to find the unique point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) that does not belong to any segment from the family \( \mathcal{F} \) other than \( \overline{AB} \). The family \( \mathcal{F} \) consists of segments \( \overline{PQ} \) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \( P \) on the \( x \)-axis and \( Q \) on the \( y \)-axis.

First, we determine the equation of line \( \overline{AB} \). The slope of \( \overline{AB} \) is calculated as:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using point-slope form with point \( A \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) \), the equation of \( \overline{AB} \) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we consider the family of lines \( \overline{PQ} \) which can be written as \( \frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1 \) with \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \). These lines form an envelope, which is an astroid given by \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \).

To find the point \( C \) where \( \overline{AB} \) is tangent to the astroid, we equate the slopes of \( \overline{AB} \) and the tangent to the astroid at \( C \). The slope of \( \overline{AB} \) is \( -\sqrt{3} \). The derivative of the astroid equation at \( C \) is:
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{y^{1/3}}{x^{1/3}}
\]
Setting this equal to \( -\sqrt{3} \), we get:
\[
\frac{y^{1/3}}{x^{1/3}} = \sqrt{3} \implies \frac{y}{x} = 3\sqrt{3}
\]
Thus, \( y = 3\sqrt{3}x \).

Substituting \( y = 3\sqrt{3}x \) into the equation of \( \overline{AB} \):
\[
3\sqrt{3}x = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
4\sqrt{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies x = \frac{1}{8}
\]
Then, \( y = 3\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \).

Thus, point \( C \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right) \). The distance \( OC \) squared is:
\[
OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}
\]

Therefore, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \) and the sum \( p + q \) is \( 7 + 16 = 23 \).

\[
\boxed{23}
\]
