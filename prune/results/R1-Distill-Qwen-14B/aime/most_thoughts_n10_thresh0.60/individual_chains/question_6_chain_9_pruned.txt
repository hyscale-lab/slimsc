Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me try to read it again and understand what it's asking.

We're given two functions: f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, we have two equations:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

And we need to find the number of intersections of these two graphs.

Hmm, okay. So, an intersection point (a, b) would satisfy both equations. That means when x = a and y = b, both equations hold true.

Let me break this down. Since the first equation is y expressed in terms of x, and the second is x expressed in terms of y, maybe I can set them equal or substitute one into the other. But it's a bit tricky because both are defined in terms of sine and cosine functions with arguments involving π.

First, maybe I should try to understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. Let's start by analyzing f(x) and g(x).

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner function |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 would have vertices at (0, -1/2). Then taking the absolute value of that, ||x| - 1/2|, would reflect any negative parts back up. So, the graph of f(x) would have a W-shape or maybe a series of V-shapes.

Wait, let me think. |x| is V-shaped. Then |x| - 1/2 would shift it down, making it V-shaped but with the vertex at (0, -1/2). Then taking the absolute value of that function would flip the parts below the x-axis up. So, the function f(x) would have a W-shape, with the central dip at x=0, y=-1/2, and then flipping it to make a V again. So, the graph of f(x) would have two minima at x=0, y=1/2, and then it goes up on either side.

Wait no, maybe not exactly. Let's consider f(x) = ||x| - a|, where a is a positive constant. The graph of |x| is V-shaped with vertex at (0,0). Subtracting a shifts the vertex down to (0, -a). Then taking the absolute value of that, so ||x| - a|, would flip any part below the x-axis back up. So, the resulting graph would have two minima at x = ±a, y=0. Wait, is that right?

Wait, let's take specific points. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:

When x ≥ 0, f(x) = |x - 1/2|.

So, when x is between 0 and 1/2, x - 1/2 is negative, so |x - 1/2| = 1/2 - x. So, it's a line decreasing from (0, 1/2) to (1/2, 0).

When x ≥ 1/2, |x - 1/2| = x - 1/2, so it's a line increasing from (1/2, 0) onwards.

Similarly, for x ≤ 0, since |x| = -x, f(x) = | -x - 1/2 | = |x + 1/2|. So, for x ≤ -1/2, |x + 1/2| = -x - 1/2, which is a line increasing as x decreases. Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, for x ≤ 0, f(x) = |-x - 1/2| = |x + 1/2|.

Wait, perhaps I should graph f(x) step by step.

The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Let me first evaluate f(x) for x ≥ 0.

For x ≥ 0, |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|.

Which is a V-shape with vertex at x=1/2, y=0.

Similarly, for x ≤ 0, |x| = -x, so
