Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: Find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, since \( |z| = 4 \), I know that \( z \) lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. That might come in handy later. Maybe I can represent \( z \) in polar form? Yeah, that's a common approach with complex numbers and their magnitudes. So, let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That should make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of \( \theta \).

Wait, but before I jump into that, let me see if I can simplify the expression a bit. The given expression is \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\). Since \( |z| = 4 \), I know that \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \), because the magnitude squared of \( z \) is \( 4^2 = 16 \). So maybe that can help me rewrite the expression.

Let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), so \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{4e^{-i\theta}}{16} = \frac{e^{-i\theta}}{4} \). Hmm, substituting that into the expression, I get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{e^{-i\theta}}{4}
\]

Simplify the constants:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4 = 300 + 468i \), so that's \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 24 + 36i \), so that's \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, the entire expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, okay. Maybe I can express this as a sum of exponentials, which might be easier to handle. Alternatively, perhaps I can use Euler's formula to break this down into sine and cosine terms because we're dealing with \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me denote \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, substituting these into the expression:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me compute each part separately.

Starting with the first term:

Multiply \( (300 + 468i) \) with \( (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \):

Using distributive property:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta

But \( i^2 = -1 \), so:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta

Combine like terms:

Real parts: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i \)

So, first term simplifies to:

\( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) \)

Now, the second term:

Multiply \( (24 + 36i) \) with \( (\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \):

= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \):

= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta

Combine like terms:

Real parts: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i \)

So, second term simplifies to:

\( (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) \)

Now, adding the first and second terms together:

Real parts: \( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) \)
Imaginary parts: \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) \)

Simplify real parts:

\( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Simplify imaginary parts:

\( (300 - 24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta = 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)

So, the entire expression becomes:

\( (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta) \)

But we're only interested in the real part. So, the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, for the real parts:

First term real
