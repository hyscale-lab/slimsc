Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll start by understanding the problem. I have three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers, adding up to 300. There's also this other equation involving their squares and products. Let me write down the equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I think I can factor the second equation somehow to make it simpler. Let me see. The second equation is the sum of all possible terms where one variable is squared and multiplied by another. So, it's symmetric in a, b, c, which might be helpful.

Wait, let me factor this expression. Let's group terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, nice. Now, from the first equation, I know that a + b + c = 300. So, (b + c) would be 300 - a, right? Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So, substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

So, combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, this looks a bit more manageable. Maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of known quantities.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, from this, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, that's 300² = 90,000. So,

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

Similarly, maybe I can find a formula for a³ + b³ + c³. I think there's an identity for that as well. Let me recall... Oh right, a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, substituting that in:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Calculating 300³: 300*300 = 90,000, 90,000*300 = 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Now, let's go back to the equation we had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting the expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - (27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)):

= 300*90,000 - 300*2(ab + bc + ca)
= 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca)

Then, subtract the expression (27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc):

So, putting it all together:

[27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca)] - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) -27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Now, simplify terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

(-600 + 900)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

So, 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Let me factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm, so now we have:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Let me rewrite this equation:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can find a way to express this equation in terms of symmetric variables or find a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. Then, from our earlier steps, we have:

100P - Q = 2,000,000

Which can be written as:

Q = 100P - 2,000,000

So, Q = 100P - 2,000,000

But I also know that from the identity for a³ + b³ + c³, which is S³ - 3SP + 3Q. But I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

Wait, maybe I can recall that for three variables a, b, c, the elementary symmetric sums are S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

Is there a way to express the equation in terms of P and Q?

Yes, from the equation above, we have Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, if I can find another equation involving P and Q, perhaps I can solve for them.

I know that S = 300, so perhaps I can use the relation between S, P, and Q given by the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c.

The cubic equation would be x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0. So,

x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0

Since Q = 100P - 2,000,000, substitute that into the equation:

x³ - 300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0

Group terms:

x³ - 300x² + (P - 100P)x + 2,000,000 = 0
x³ - 300x² - 99P x + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express P in terms of S and other variables. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps I can look for possible values of a, b, c such that their sum is 300 and the other equation is satisfied. But 300 is a large number, so enumerating all possibilities isn't feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that two of the variables are equal, or perhaps all three are equal. Let's see what happens if all three are equal.

If a = b = c, then since a + b + c = 300, each is 100. Let
