Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and their products, sometimes it's helpful to look for symmetries or try to factor expressions. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term in the second equation is a product of one variable squared and another variable. Maybe I can factor something out here.

Let me write the second equation as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Since I know from the first equation that a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), right? Similarly, (a + c) would be (300 - b), and (a + b) would be (300 - c). So substituting that into the second equation, I get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³,
b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³,
c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³.

Adding all these together:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, the equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Now, I wonder if I can find a relationship between a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe using known identities or by expressing a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and ab + bc + ca or something like that.

I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Let me write that down:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Given that a + b + c = 300, let's compute (a + b + c)³:

300³ = 27,000,000.

So, substituting that in:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc
= 27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Now, let's also compute a² + b² + c². I know that a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, this becomes:

a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca)
= 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Okay, so now I can write both a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of (ab + bc + ca) and abc. Let's substitute these into our earlier equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting a² + b² + c²:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - [27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2(ab + bc + ca)) = -600(ab + bc + ca).

So that term becomes 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca).

Now, subtract the entire expression [27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc]:

So, 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify the terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600(ab + bc + ca) + 900(ab + bc + ca) = 300(ab + bc + ca).

And then -3abc.

So, the equation becomes:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

This seems a bit simpler. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 300 and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

I wonder if I can manipulate this equation further. Let me rewrite it:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me factor this differently. Maybe factor out ab, bc, or ca? Alternatively, perhaps I can divide both sides by abc if none of a, b, c are zero, but since they are nonnegative integers, they can be zero, so that might not be safe. Alternatively, perhaps expressing in terms of symmetric functions.

Wait, let's consider that a + b + c = 300. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca.

So, our equation is:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

We also have S = 300.

I remember that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

I wonder if I can relate Q and P in another way. Perhaps using some inequality or trying to find possible values for Q and P.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation as:

P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But I also know that:

From the theory of symmetric sums, for three variables, the relationship between S, Q, and P is governed by the characteristic equation x³ - Sx² + Qx - P = 0. So, the roots a, b, c satisfy x³ - 300x² + Qx - P = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can find a way to express Q in terms of S and then substitute into the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for a, b, c being nonnegative integers, certain bounds apply. For example, since a + b + c = 300, each of a, b, c can be at most 300.

Let me think about this equation again: 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

I can express this as P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But also, from the first equation, Q = ab + bc + ca. So, perhaps if I can find relationships involving Q and P.

Another thought: perhaps express the equation as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca = -2,000,000.

Hmm, maybe factor terms:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b) = -2,000,000.
