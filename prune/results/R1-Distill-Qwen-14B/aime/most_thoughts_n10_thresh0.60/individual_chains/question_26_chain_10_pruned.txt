Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, express it as m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me visualize the figure. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, it's not a right-angled triangle because 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10² = 100. So, it's an acute or obtuse triangle. Hmm, maybe I can check using the cosine law later.

The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something related to the polar line. Wait, more importantly, the point D is the ex-pole with respect to BC. Also, since D is the intersection of the two tangents, it must lie on the symmedian of triangle ABC, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Now, line AD intersects ω again at P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle. We need to find AP.

Given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10, I can compute various properties of triangle ABC, such as its semiperimeter, area, circumradius, etc.

Let me start by calculating the semiperimeter (s) of triangle ABC:

s = (AB + BC + AC) / 2 = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, using Heron's formula, the area (Δ) is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)].

So, Δ = sqrt[12*(12 - 5)*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] Wait, actually, let me compute 12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So, sqrt(504) can be simplified. 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, no, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Alternatively, 504 = 16 * 31.5 isn't helpful. Let me factor 504
