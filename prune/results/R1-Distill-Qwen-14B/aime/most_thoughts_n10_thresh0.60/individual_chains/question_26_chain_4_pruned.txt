Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so first, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, tangents at B and C meet at D. So D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents at B and C meet at an external point D.

Then, line AD intersects ω again at P. So P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle.

I need to find the length AP.

Hmm, okay. So maybe I can use some properties related to power of a point, cyclic quadrilaterals, or perhaps some similar triangles.

Let me recall some concepts.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² = DC². Because the power is equal to the square of the tangent length from the point to the circle.

So, power of D: DB = DC.

Also, point D lies on the external tangent, so triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, D is constructed by extending the tangents at B and C. So, that makes sense.

Now, line AD intersects ω again at P. So, we can think about the power of point A with respect to ω, but A is on ω, so the power is zero. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps use properties of intersecting chords or something.

Alternatively, maybe use harmonic division or inversion. Hmm, but maybe inversion is too complicated.

Wait, perhaps use Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem. Let me think.

Alternatively, homothety. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, using coordinate geometry. Maybe assign coordinates to the triangle and compute everything step by step.

Wait, triangle ABC with sides 5,9,10. Let's check if it's a right-angled triangle. Let me see: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106. 10² is 100, which is less than 106, so no. So it's an acute or obtuse triangle. Let me see, since 5² + 9² > 10², so angle opposite to 10 is acute. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines to find angles.

Alternatively, maybe use Stewart's theorem to find lengths related to the cevian AD.

Wait, but I don't know AD yet.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate AD and AP through power of a point.

Wait, point A is on ω, so if I consider point A, and line AD intersects ω again at P, then the power of A with respect to ω is zero, so AP * AA = 0, which doesn't help much.

Wait, perhaps point D is outside ω, and AD is a secant from D through A intersecting ω at P. Then, power of D with respect to ω would be DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

Wait, that sounds promising.

Yes, because the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB², and also equal to DP * DA, since D lies outside the circle and AD is a secant line.

So, DB² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate DP and DA. But I don't know DA yet.

Wait, but maybe I can find DB in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle. The length of the tangent from D to ω is DB = DC.

But to find DB, I need to know the distance from D to ω's center or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for the distance from D to the circumcircle.

Wait, but perhaps using triangle areas or Heron's formula to find the circumradius first.

Yes, that might be a way. Let's compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC.
