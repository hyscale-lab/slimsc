Okay, so I've got this problem here about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue randomly, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what it means for the octagon to be rotatable so that all blue vertices align with the original red positions. So, basically, after some rotation, every blue vertex should be in a position that was previously red. That suggests that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait a second, so if the octagon is regular, it has rotational symmetry. So, when we talk about rotating the octagon, we can rotate it by multiples of 45 degrees since 360/8 = 45. So, possible rotations are 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., up to 315째, which are 8 distinct rotations.

The problem is essentially asking for the number of colorings where the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices. But wait, not exactly. Because the blue set needs to be a rotation of the red set, but the colorings are random.

Hmm, perhaps another way to think about it is that for some rotation, the blue vertices after rotation coincide with the red vertices. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices is a translate (rotationally shifted) version of the red vertices.

Wait, but since the octagon is regular, the rotations correspond to cyclic permutations of the vertices. So, if we fix the octagon, the colorings are assignments of red and blue to each vertex. Then, for the coloring to satisfy the condition, there must exist a rotation such that applying that rotation to the blue vertices results in the original red vertices.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices. So, if the octagon has some rotational symmetry, maybe the colorings are such that the blue and red sets are related by rotation.

But how do we count such colorings?

Maybe we can model this as follows: for a given coloring, we can represent the positions of blue vertices as
