Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

So, essentially, I have to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1, and then find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, find the smallest prime p such that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Then, find the minimal m with the same property for that p.

I think I should start by looking at small primes and checking if their squares divide any n⁴ +1.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if 2²=4 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod 4 because:

- If n is even, n=2k, so n⁴ = (2k)^4 = 16k⁴ ≡ 0 mod 4.
- If n is odd, n=2k+1, so n⁴ = (2k+1)^4. Expanding this, the binomial expansion will have all even terms except the last term, which is 1. So, n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 4.

Thus, n⁴ +1 is 0+1=1 mod 4 if n is even, and 1+1=2 mod 4 if n is odd. So, n⁴ +1 mod 4 is either 1 or 2. It can never be 0 mod 4, which means 4 doesn't divide any n⁴ +1. So, p cannot be 2.

Next, p=3. Let's check if 3²=9 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

First, find n mod 3. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=0,1,2,...,8.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 0 to 8, since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers.

Compute n⁴ mod 9:

- n=0: 0⁴=0 mod9=0
- n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9=1
- n=2: 16 mod9=7
- n=3: 81 mod9=0
- n=4: (4)^4=256 mod9. 256 /9=28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4.
- n=5: 5^4=625. 625 /9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. So 4.
- n=6: 6^4=1296 mod9=0
- n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 /9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7. So 7.
- n=8: 8^4=4096. Let's see, 4096 mod9. 4096 divided by 9: 9*455=4095, so 4096 mod9=1.

So, looking at the results:

n mod9: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
n⁴ mod9: 0 1 7 0 4 4 0 7 1

So, n⁴ +1 mod9 would be:

n=0: 0+1=1
n=1:1+1=2
n=2:7+1=8
n=3:0+1=1
n=4:4+1=5
n=5:4+1=5
n=6:0+1=1
n=7:7+1=8
n=8:1+1=2

So, mod9, n⁴+1 can be 1,2,5,8. Does 0 ever appear? No. So 9 doesn't divide n⁴+1 for any n. So p=3 is not suitable.

Next prime, p=5. Check if 5²=25 divides n⁴+1 for some n.

Again, I can compute n⁴ mod25 and see if any n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25, which would mean n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

Alternatively, I can try small n's and compute n⁴ mod25.

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n=0 to 24.

But that's a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way. Since n and n+25 are the same mod25, I can compute n⁴ mod25 for n=0 to 12, since after that it repeats due to symmetry.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=0 to 12:

n=0: 0
n=1:1
n=2: 16
n=3:81 mod25=6
n=4:256 mod25. 25*10=250, 256-250=6. So 6.
n=5:625 mod25=0
n=6:6^4=1296 mod25. 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21. So 21.
n=7:7^4=2401. 25*96=2400, 2401-2400=1. So 1.
n=8:8^4=4096. 25*163=4075, 4096-4075=21. So 21.
n=9:9^4=6561. 25*262=6550, 6561-6550=11. So 11.
n=10:10^4=10000 mod25=0
n=11:11^4=14641. Let's compute 14641 mod25. 25*585=14625, 14641-14625=16. So 16.
n=12:12^4=20736. 25*829=20725, 20736-20725=11. So 11.

So, n⁴ mod25 for n=0-12:

0:0

1:1

2:16

3:6

4:6

5:0

6:21

7:1

8:21

9:11

10:0

11:16

12:11

So, for n=0 to12, n⁴ mod25 is:

n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

mod25:0 1 16 6 6 0 21 1 21 11 0 16 11

Looking for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25, which is 24 mod25. So, 24 is not in the above list. The residues are 0,1,6,11,16,21.

So, n⁴ mod25 can't be 24. Therefore, 25 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So, p=5 is out.

Next prime, p=7. Check if 7²=49 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

So, we need to find if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49.

Alternatively, n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod49.

To find such n, perhaps we can compute n⁴ mod49 for n from 0 to 48, but that's a lot. Alternatively, we can use properties of modular arithmetic.

First, note that 49 is 7². So, perhaps if n is coprime to 7, we can use Euler's theorem. Euler's totient function φ(49)=42, so n^42 ≡1 mod49 for n coprime to 7.

But I need n⁴ ≡-1 mod49. So, n^8 ≡1 mod49. So the order of n modulo 49 divides 8. But since n^4 ≡-1, the order must be 8, because (-1)^2=1. So, the multiplicative order of n modulo49 is 8.

So, we need to find if there's a primitive root of order 8 modulo49. Or, in other words, does 8 divide φ(49)=42? Let's see: 42 divided by 8 is 5.25, which is not an integer. Wait, but the multiplicative group mod49 is cyclic of order 42, so the possible orders are the divisors of 42. 8 is not a divisor of 42 (since 42=2*3*7), so there's no element of order 8 in the multiplicative group mod49. Therefore, there is no solution to n⁴ ≡-1 mod49. So, 49 does not divide n⁴ +1 for any n. Hence, p=7 is not suitable.

Next prime, p=11. So, check if 11²=121 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

We need n⁴ ≡ -1 mod121.

I think this might be possible. Let me see.

Wait, before checking, maybe I can recall that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². So, primes where p ≡1 mod8. Because for -1 to be a quartic residue, p must be 1 mod8, because the multiplicative order in the field would need to divide (p-1)/something.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me check for n=10.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod121.

Alternatively, I can write n⁴ ≡ -1 mod11 first, and then see if it can be lifted to mod121 using Hensel's lemma.

First, find n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod11.

Compute n⁴ mod11 for n=0 to 10.

n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

n^4 mod11:

0:0

1:1

2:16 mod11=5

3:81 mod11=4

4:256 mod11. 256 /11=23*11=253, 256-253=3. So 3.

5:625 mod11. 625 /11=56*11=616, 625-616=9. So 9.

6:1296 mod11. 1296 /11=117*11=1287, 1296-1287=9. So 9.

7:2401 mod11. 2401 /11=218*11=2398, 2401-2398=3. So 3.

8:4096 mod11. 4096 /11=372*11=4092, 4096-4092=4. So 4.

9:6561 mod11. 6561 /11=596*11=6556, 6561-6556=5. So 5.

10:10000 mod11. 10000 /11=909*11=9999, 10000-9999=1. So 1.

So, n⁴ mod11:

n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

mod11:0 1 5 4 3 9 9 3 4 5 1

Looking for n^4 ≡-1 mod11. Since -1 mod11 is 10. So, is 10 in the above list? No. The residues are 0,1,3,4,5,9. So, no n satisfies n⁴ ≡-1 mod11. Therefore, p=11 is also not suitable.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because I'm trying to find p such that p² divides n⁴+1. So, maybe p=17?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about primes where -1 is a quartic residue mod p, and then see if it can be lifted to mod p². Maybe I should look for primes p ≡1 mod8, because -1 is a square iff p ≡1 mod4, which is a necessary condition, but being a quartic residue requires more.

Wait, another approach: n^4 ≡ -1 mod p. So, n^8 ≡1 mod p. So, the order of n modulo p divides 8. Also, since n^4 ≡-1, the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 divides p-1, so p ≡1 mod8.

So, primes p ≡1 mod8. The primes are 17, 41, 73, etc. So, the smallest prime is 17.

Wait, so p=17 is a candidate. Let me check if 17²=289 divides n⁴+1 for some n.

First, check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod17. Then, using Hensel's lemma, see if it can be lifted to mod289.

So, first, find n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod17.

Compute n⁴ mod17 for n=0 to16.

Alternatively, compute n^8 mod17 and see if it's 1, but n⁴ is either 1 or -1 mod17.

Wait, n^4 mod17:

Let me compute n=1:1

n=2:16 mod17=16

n=3:81 mod17. 17*4=68, 81-68=13. 13.

n=4:256 mod17. 17*15=255, 256-255=1. So 1.

n=5:625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13. 13.

n=6:1296 mod17. 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4. So 4.

Wait, maybe this is taking too long. Alternatively, maybe I can find if -1 is a quartic residue mod17.

If p=17, then the multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic of order16. So, the quartic residues would be the elements of order dividing 4. So, the number of quartic residues is φ(4)=2, so there are 2 quartic residues. Wait, no, the number of quartic residues is φ(4)=2, but perhaps the number of quartic residues is (17-1)/4=4. Wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic of order16. The number of quartic residues is φ(4)=2, but wait, actually, the number of solutions to x^4 ≡a mod17 depends on a. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, the equation x^4 ≡-1 mod17 would have a solution if and only if -1 is a quartic residue mod17.

Since 17 ≡1 mod8, -1 is a square, but is it a quartic residue?

Wait, in a field where p ≡1 mod8, -1 is a quartic residue. Because the multiplicative order is 16, so 8 divides 16, so the multiplicative group has elements of order 8, so x^4=-1 would have solutions.

Wait, let me compute n^4 mod17 for some n:

n=2: 2^4=16≡-1 mod17. Oh, right! So, n=2 gives n^4=16≡-1 mod17. So, 2⁴ ≡-1 mod17. So, n=2 is a solution mod17.

So, now, using Hensel's lemma, can we lift this solution to mod17²=289?

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there's a unique lift mod p².

Here, f(n)=n⁴ +1. So, f'(n)=4n³.

At n=2, f(2)=16 +1=17≡0 mod17.

f'(2)=4*(8)=32≡15 mod17. Since 15≡-2 mod17≠0 mod17, so Hensel's applies.

So, the solution can be lifted uniquely.

So, we can find a unique n≡2 mod17 such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

So, n=2 +17k, and we need to find k such that (2+17k)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Let me compute (2+17k)^4:

First, expand using binomial theorem:

(2 +17k)^4 = 2^4 + 4*2^3*(17k) + 6*2^2*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Compute each term mod289.

Since 17²=289, any term with (17k)^2 or higher will be 0 mod289.

So, compute up to the linear term:

= 16 + 4*8*(17k) + higher terms (which are 0 mod289).

So, 16 + 4*8*17k.

Compute 4*8=32, 32*17=544.

So, the expansion mod289 is 16 + 544k mod289.

But 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255.

So, 544k mod289=255k.

Thus, (2+17k)^4 ≡16 +255k mod289.

We want this ≡-1 mod289. So,

16 +255k ≡-1 mod289.

Which is 255k ≡-17 mod289.

Simplify this equation.

255k ≡-17 mod289.

Let me compute 255 and 289. Since 289=17², and 255=15*17.

So, 255=15*17, 289=17².

So, the equation is 15*17*k ≡-17 mod17².

Divide both sides by 17: 15k ≡-1 mod17.

So, 15k ≡16 mod17.

Now, 15 mod17 is -2. So, equation is -2k ≡16 mod17.

Multiply both sides by -1: 2k ≡-16 mod17 → 2k ≡1 mod17 (since -16 ≡1 mod17).

So, 2k ≡1 mod17.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod17, which is 9, since 2*9=18≡1 mod17.

So, k≡9*1=9 mod17.

Thus, k=9 +17m for some integer m.

But since we're looking for the least positive integer m, let's take k=9.

So, n=2 +17*9=2+153=155.

Wait, but wait. Wait, let me verify. Because in Hensel's, we only need k to satisfy the equation mod17, so k=9 is the solution. So, n=2+17*9=155.

But wait, let me compute 155⁴ mod289 to check.

But 155 is 2 mod17, so 155=2+17*9.

Compute 155⁴:

But it's a bit tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 155 mod289, which is 155.

Compute 155²=24025. 24025 mod289: Let's compute 289*83=23947, 24025-23947=78. So, 155²≡78 mod289.

Then, 155⁴=(155²)^2≡78² mod289.

Compute 78²=6084. 6084 /289: 289*21=6069, 6084-6069=15. So, 78²≡15 mod289.

So, 155⁴≡15 mod289.

But wait, we wanted 155⁴ ≡-1 mod289, which is 288 mod289. 15≡15≠288. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's go back. Maybe I made a mistake in expanding (2+17k)^4.

Wait, the expansion is:

(2 +17k)^4 = 16 + 4*(8)*(17k) + 6*(4)*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But since 17²=289, any term with (17k)^2 or higher is 0 mod289. So, the expansion mod289 is 16 + 4*8*17k.

Which is 16 + 544k. Now, 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So, 544k ≡255k mod289.

So, 16 +255k ≡-1 mod289.

Which is 255k ≡-17 mod289.

Then, as before, 255k ≡272 mod289 (since -17=272 mod289).

Wait, wait, no. 255k ≡-17 mod289. So, 255k +17 ≡0 mod289.

So, 255k +17 ≡0 mod289.

Which is, 255k ≡-17 mod289.

But 255=15*17, 289=17².

So, we can write this as:

15*17*k +17 ≡0 mod17².

Factor out 17: 17*(15k +1) ≡0 mod17².

Which implies that 15k +1 ≡0 mod17.

So, 15k ≡-1 mod17.

15 mod17 is -2, so:

-2k ≡-1 mod17 → 2k ≡1 mod17.

Thus, k ≡9 mod17 (since 2*9=18≡1 mod17).

So, k=9 +17m. Let's take m=0, so k=9.

Thus, n=2 +17*9=155.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed n=155: 155² mod289=78, 78²=6084 mod289=15.

So, 155⁴≡15 mod289, which is not -1. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me redo the expansion:

(2 +17k)^4.

Using binomial expansion:

= 2^4 + 4*(2^3)*(17k) + 6*(2²)*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Yes, as before.

Now, compute each term mod289.

= 16 + 4*8*17k + 6*4*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But since 17²=289, any term with (17k)^2 or higher is 0 mod289.

So, the expansion is 16 + 4*8*17k mod289.

Compute 4*8=32, 32*17=544.

544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So, 544k=255k mod289.

So, total is 16 +255k mod289.

We set this equal to -1 mod289: 16 +255k ≡-1 mod289 → 255k ≡-17 mod289.

So, 255k ≡272 mod289.

Now, 255 and 289 have a GCD. Compute GCD(255,289).

289 ÷255=1 with remainder 34.

255 ÷34=7 with remainder 17.

34 ÷17=2 with remainder 0.

So, GCD is 17.

So, the equation 255k ≡272 mod289 can be simplified.

Divide both sides by 17: 255/17=15, 272/17=16, 289/17=17.

So, the equation becomes 15k ≡16 mod17.

15 mod17= -2.

So, -2k ≡16 mod17 → 2k ≡-16 mod17 → 2k ≡1 mod17 (since -16 ≡1 mod17).

Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod17, which is 9: k≡9 mod17.

So, k=9 +17m. Let's take m=0, so k=9.

Thus, n=2 +17*9=155.

But earlier, when computing 155⁴ mod289, I got 15 instead of -1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that computation.

Wait, let me compute 155 mod289=155.

Compute 155²: 155*155.

Let me compute 150²=22500.

150*5=750, 5*150=750, 5*5=25.

So, (150+5)^2=150² + 2*150*5 +5²=22500 +1500 +25=24025.

24025 divided by289: Let's see, 289*83=23947.

24025-23947=78. So, 155²≡78 mod289.

Then, 78²=6084.

Compute 6084 divided by289.

289*21=6069.

6084-6069=15.

So, 78²≡15 mod289.

Thus, 155⁴=(155²)^2≡78²≡15 mod289.

Hmm, which is not -1, so 15≡15 mod289, which is not 288.

Wait, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe n=34 is a solution? Let me check 34.

Compute 34 mod17=0. So, 34=17*2. Then 34⁴=(17*2)^4=17^4*16. Which is 0 mod289, since 17²=289.

So, 34⁴≡0 mod289. So, 34⁴ +1≡1 mod289, not 0.

Alternatively, maybe n=17k +2, but k= something else?

Wait, maybe I should have taken k= -16 instead of 9.

Wait, let me see. 255k ≡-17 mod289.

We had 255k ≡272 mod289.

Wait, 255 is 15*17, and 272 is 16*17.

So, 15k ≡16 mod17.

Wait, 15 ≡-2 mod17. So, -2k ≡16 mod17 → 2k ≡-16 mod17 → 2k ≡1 mod17.

So, k≡9 mod17.

So, k=9, 26, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should compute for k=9, n=2+17*9=155.

Wait, but that didn't work. Maybe I need to take k=9 +17=26.

Let me compute n=2+17*26=2+442=444.

But 444 mod289: 444-289=155. So, 444≡155 mod289. So, same as before. So, 444⁴ ≡155⁴≡15 mod289.

Hmm, same result. So, it's not working.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the derivative f'(2)=4*(2)^3=32≡15 mod17≠0, so Hensel's lemma gives a unique solution. So, why is 155⁴≡15 mod289 instead of -1?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 155⁴ mod289.

Let me compute 155 mod289=155.

Compute 155²: 155*155=24025.

24025 /289: Let's compute 289*83=23947.

24025 -23947=78. So, 155²≡78 mod289.

Then, 78²=6084.

Compute 6084 /289: 289*21=6069.

6084-6069=15. So, 78²≡15 mod289.

So, 155⁴≡15 mod289.

But we wanted 155⁴≡-1 mod289. So, 15≡-1 mod289? No, because 15+1=16, which is not 0 mod289.

Wait, that suggests that either my calculations are wrong, or perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try another k value. Wait, but Hensel's lemma says that if f'(n)≠0 mod p, then there's a unique lift. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let me compute (2 +17k)^4 mod289.

Compute 17k as a single term for simplicity.

(2 + a)^4, where a=17k.

Expanding: 16 + 4*8*a + 6*4*a² + 4*2*a³ +a^4.

But a²=(17k)^2=289k²≡0 mod289. So, a² and higher terms vanish.

So, (2 +a)^4 ≡16 + 32a mod289.

Set this equal to -1 mod289:

16 +32a ≡-1 →32a ≡-17 mod289.

But a=17k. So, 32*(17k) ≡-17 mod289.

32*17=544. 544 mod289=544-289=255.

So, 255k ≡-17 mod289.

Which is the same as before.

So, 255k ≡272 mod289.

Divide by GCD(255,289)=17:

15k ≡16 mod17.

15≡-2 mod17.

So, -2k ≡16 → 2k ≡-16 mod17 → 2k ≡1 mod17.

Thus, k≡9 mod17. So, k=9 +17m.

Therefore, n=2 +17*(9 +17m)=2 +153 +289m=155 +289m.

So, the minimal positive n is 155.

But as we saw, 155⁴≡15 mod289, which is not -1. So, where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Wait, 32a is 32*(17k)=544k.

But 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So, 544k≡255k mod289.

So, 16 +255k ≡-1 mod289.

Which leads to 255k≡-17 mod289.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 255k ≡-17 mod289.

Which is, 255k ≡272 mod289.

We can write this as 255k=272 +289m.

But 255 and 289 have GCD 17. So, 255=17*15, 272=17*16, 289=17².

Thus, 15k=16 +17m.

So, 15k ≡16 mod17.

Again, same as before: 15k≡16 mod17 →k≡9 mod17.

So, k=9, 26, etc.

So, n=2 +17*9=155, 2 +17*26=444, etc.

But 155⁴≡15 mod289, which doesn't equal -1.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Maybe p=17 is not the correct prime.

Wait, earlier, I thought that p=17 is the smallest prime ≡1 mod8. But wait, let me check p=13.

Wait, p=13 is 13≡5 mod8. So, not 1 mod8.

p=17 is 17≡1 mod8.

Wait, but maybe p=13 can still divide n⁴+1 for some n.

Wait, let me check p=13.

Check if 13²=169 divides n⁴+1 for some n.

First, check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod13.

Compute n⁴ mod13 for n=1 to12.

n:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

n^4 mod13:

1:1

2:16 mod13=3

3:81 mod13=3 (since 13*6=78, 81-78=3)

4:256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9.

5:625 mod13. 13*48=624, 625-624=1.

6:1296 mod13. 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9.

7:2401 mod13. 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me compute 7^4= (7²)^2=49²=2401. 2401 /13=184*13=2392, 2401-2392=9. So, 7^4≡9 mod13.

8:8^4=(8²)^2=64²=4096. 4096 mod13. Let's compute 13*315=4095, so 4096-4095=1. So, 8^4≡1 mod13.

9:9^4=(9²)^2=81²=6561. 6561 mod13. 13*504=6552, 6561-6552=9. So, 9^4≡9 mod13.

10:10^4=10000. 10000 mod13. 13*769=9997, 10000-9997=3. So, 10^4≡3 mod13.

11:11^4=(121)^2. 121 mod13=4, so 4²=16≡3 mod13.

12:12^4=(144)^2. 144 mod13=1, so 1²=1.

So, n⁴ mod13:

n:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

mod13:1 3 3 9 1 9 9 1 9 3 3 1

Looking for n⁴≡-1 mod13. Since -1 mod13=12. But in the above, the residues are 1,3,9.

12 is not among them, so there's no solution for n⁴≡-1 mod13. So, p=13 is out.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check n=5: 5⁴=625 mod13=625-13*48=625-624=1. So, yes, n=5 gives 1, not -1.

So, p=13 is not suitable.

So, back to p=17. But the calculation shows that n=155 gives 155⁴≡15 mod289, not -1. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the lifting process.

Alternatively, maybe p=17 is not the correct prime. Maybe I should go to the next prime p=  ... Wait, what's the next prime after 17? 19, 23, 29, etc. Wait, p=  17, then 23, 29, 37, 41, etc.

Wait, but earlier, I thought p=17 is the smallest prime where -1 is a quartic residue mod p. So, perhaps I should check p=  17, then 41, etc.

Wait, let me check p=  17 again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute n=155⁴ mod289 again.

155 mod289=155.

Compute 155²: 155*155=24025.

24025 mod289: 289*83=23947, 24025-23947=78. So, 155²≡78 mod289.

Then, 78²=6084.

6084 mod289: 289*21=6069, 6084-6069=15. So, 78²≡15 mod289.

So, 155⁴≡15 mod289.

Hmm, I'm getting 15 instead of 288 (-1). So, perhaps the mistake is that p=17 is not suitable, and the next prime is p=  41.

Wait, but that seems unlikely. Maybe I should check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute n=  2 mod17, and find the minimal m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

Wait, perhaps n=  2: 2⁴=16, 16+1=17, which is 17. So, 17 divides 17, but 289 doesn't. So, n=2: 2⁴+1=17.

n=  17*2=34: 34⁴= (34²)^2=1156². 1156²=1336336. 1336336 mod289: Let me compute 289*4630=1336330. 1336336-1336330=6. So, 34⁴≡6 mod289. 6+1=7≡7 mod289≠0.

n=  17*3=51: 51⁴= (51²)^2=2601². Compute 2601² mod289.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal m is  155, but 155⁴≡15 mod289, which is not 0. So, perhaps p=17 is not suitable, and the next prime is p=  41.

Wait, but that would take us away from the minimal p. Wait, perhaps I should check p=  17 again. Maybe I made a mistake in the Hensel's step.

Wait, let me try to compute (2 +17k)^4 mod289.

Let me compute 2^4=16.

Then, 4*(2^3)*(17k)=4*8*17k=544k≡255k mod289.

So, 16 +255k ≡-1 mod289 →255k≡-17 mod289.

Now, 255 and 289 have GCD 17, so divide both sides by 17:

15k≡-1 mod17.

15≡-2 mod17, so:

-2k≡-1 mod17 →2k≡1 mod17.

k≡9 mod17.

So, k=9.

Thus, n=2 +17*9=155.

But 155⁴≡15 mod289, which is not 0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe p=  17 is not the minimal prime. Let me check p=  13 again.

Wait, earlier I thought p=13 doesn't work, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute n=  5 mod13: 5^4=625≡625-13*48=625-624=1 mod13.

So, 5⁴≡1 mod13. So, 5⁴+1≡2 mod13≠0.

n=  10: 10^4=10000≡10000 mod13. 13*769=9997, 10000-9997=3 mod13. So, 10^4+1≡4 mod13≠0.

n=  12: 12^4=20736. 12^4 mod13= (12 mod13)^4=1^4=1. So, 12⁴+1≡2 mod13.

Hmm, so no solution for p=13.

Wait, maybe p=  17 is the minimal prime, but my earlier calculation is wrong. Perhaps I should accept that m=  155 is the minimal m for p=17, even though 155⁴≡15 mod289, which is not 0. But that's a contradiction because Hensel's lemma should give a solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 155⁴ mod289.

Wait, let me compute 155 mod289=155.

Compute 155²=24025. 24025 mod289: 289*83=23947, 24025-23947=78. So, 155²=78 mod289.

Then, 78²=6084. 6084 mod289: 289*21=6069, 6084-6069=15. So, 78²=15 mod289.

Thus, 155⁴= (155²)^2=78²=15 mod289. So, 155⁴=15 mod289, which is not -1.

Wait, that's a problem. So, perhaps p=17 is not suitable, and the minimal prime is higher.

Wait, let me check p=  41.

Check if 41²=1681 divides n⁴+1 for some n.

First, check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod41.

Compute n⁴ mod41 for n=1 to40.

Alternatively, since 41≡1 mod4, and 4 divides 40, the multiplicative group mod41 is cyclic of order40.

So, the equation n⁴≡-1 mod41 would require that -1 is a quartic residue.

Since 41≡1 mod8, -1 is a quartic residue.

So, there exists n such that n^4≡-1 mod41.

Let me find such n.

Compute n=  2: 2^4=16≡16 mod41.

n=  3:81≡81-2*41=81-82=-1≡40 mod41. So, 3^4≡40≡-1 mod41.

So, n=3: 3⁴≡-1 mod41.

So, now, using Hensel's lemma, can we lift this to mod41²=1681.

So, n=3 +41k.

Compute f(n)=n⁴ +1.

f(3)=3⁴+1=81+1=82≡82 mod1681.

We need f(n)=0 mod1681.

First, compute f'(n)=4n³.

At n=3, f'(3)=4*27=108.

We need to solve f(3 +41k) ≡0 mod1681.

Expanding using Taylor series:

f(3+41k)=f(3) + f'(3)*41k + higher terms.

Mod1681, higher terms are 0 since (41k)^2=1681k²≡0 mod1681.

So, f(3+41k) ≡82 +108*41k mod1681.

Compute 108*41=4428.

4428 mod1681: 1681*2=3362, 4428-3362=1066.

So, f(3+41k) ≡82 +1066k mod1681.

Set this ≡0 mod1681:

82 +1066k ≡0 mod1681 →1066k ≡-82 mod1681.

Simplify:

1066k ≡1599 mod1681.

Compute GCD(1066,1681).

1681 ÷1066=1 with remainder 615.

1066 ÷615=1 with remainder 451.

615 ÷451=1 with remainder 164.

451 ÷164=2 with remainder 123.

164 ÷123=1 with remainder 41.

123 ÷41=3 with remainder 0. So, GCD is 41.

Thus, the equation can be simplified by dividing by 41:

1066/41=26, 1599/41=39, 1681/41=41.

So, 26k ≡39 mod41.

Simplify 26 mod41=26.

So, 26k ≡39 mod41.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 26 mod41.

Find inverse of 26 mod41. 26 and 41 are coprime.

Find x such that 26x ≡1 mod41.

Using extended Euclidean algorithm:

41 =1*26 +15

26=1*15 +11

15=1*11 +4

11=2*4 +3

4=1*3 +1

3=3*1 +0

Backwards:

1=4-1*3

=4 -1*(11 -2*4)=3*4 -11

=3*(15 -1*11) -11=3*15 -4*11

=3*15 -4*(26 -1*15)=7*15 -4*26

=7*(41 -1*26) -4*26=7*41 -11*26

So, inverse of 26 mod41 is -11≡30 mod41.

So, multiply both sides by 30:

k ≡39*30 mod41.

39*30=1170.

1170 /41: 41*28=1148, 1170-1148=22.

So, k≡22 mod41.

Thus, k=22 +41m.

So, the minimal positive k is 22.

Thus, n=3 +41*22=3 +902=905.

So, n=905.

Now, check 905⁴ +1 mod1681.

But that's a big computation. Alternatively, since we used Hensel's, it should work.

Thus, the minimal m for p=41 is 905.

But wait, p=17 didn't work, so p=41 is the next prime.

But wait, earlier I thought p=17 was the minimal, but it didn't work. So, perhaps p=41 is the minimal prime where p² divides n⁴ +1.

Wait, but the problem says p is the least prime for which there exists n such that p² divides n⁴+1. So, if p=17 is the minimal prime, but in our calculation, n=155 didn't work, perhaps there's a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe p=  17 is the correct prime, and n=155 is indeed the minimal m, but my calculation of 155⁴ mod289 was wrong.

Wait, let me double-check 155⁴ mod289.

Compute 155 mod289=155.

Compute 155²=24025.

24025 /289: 289*83=23947, 24025-23947=78. So, 155²≡78 mod289.

78²=6084.

6084 /289=21*289=6069, 6084-6069=15.

So, 78²≡15 mod289.

Thus, 155⁴= (155²)^2≡78²≡15 mod289.

So, 155⁴≡15 mod289, which is not 0. So, p=17 is not suitable.

Thus, the minimal prime is p=41, with m=905.

But that seems large. Maybe I made a mistake in the process.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check p=  13 again, but as before, no solution.

Wait, perhaps I should check p=  73, which is 1 mod8.

But that's getting too big.

Alternatively, maybe I should check p=  17 again, but perhaps I made a mistake in the lifting.

Wait, perhaps I should try n=  155 +289=444.

Compute 444 mod289=444-289=155. So, same as before. So, 444⁴≡15 mod289.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that maybe p=  17 is not the minimal prime, and the minimal p is 13, but I saw no solution for n⁴≡-1 mod13.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the minimal prime is 17, and accept that m=  155, even though 155⁴≡15 mod289, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal m is 155, but since 155⁴≡15 mod289, which is not 0, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me think about the equation x² ≡-1 mod p².

Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with quartic residues.

Wait, perhaps I should check if p=  17 is the minimal prime where x^4 ≡-1 mod p² has a solution.

But from earlier, it seems that it doesn't. So, perhaps the minimal prime is p=  41.

Thus, the minimal m is 905.

But that seems very large. Maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check another prime, p=  73.

Wait, but that's getting too big. Alternatively, maybe I should accept that p=17 is the minimal prime, and m=155 is the minimal m, even though 155⁴≡15 mod289, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that p=  17 is the minimal prime, and m=  155 is the minimal m.

But in that case, 155⁴ +1 is 15 +1=16 mod289, which is not 0. So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that p=17 is the minimal prime, and the minimal m is 155, even though my calculation shows otherwise, perhaps due to a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the minimal prime is p=13, but earlier calculations show no solution.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up known results. I recall that the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ +1 is p=17, and the minimal n is 155.

But according to my calculations, 155⁴≡15 mod289, which is not -1. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check n=  155⁴ mod289 again.

Wait, 155 mod289=155.

Compute 155²=24025.

24025 mod289: 289*83=23947, 24025-23947=78. So, 155²=78 mod289.

Then, 78²=6084.

6084 mod289: 289*21=6069, 6084-6069=15. So, 78²=15 mod289.

Thus, 155⁴= (155²)^2=78²=15 mod289.

Hmm, so 155⁴≡15 mod289. So, 155⁴ +1=16 mod289≠0.

So, that's a problem. So, perhaps p=17 is not suitable.

Thus, perhaps the minimal prime is p=  41, and m=905.

But that seems large. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Hensel's step for p=17.

Wait, perhaps I should compute n=  155 +289=444.

444 mod289=444-289=155. So, same as before. So, 444⁴≡15 mod289.

Thus, same result.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Maybe the minimal prime is p=  13, but earlier I saw no solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that p=17 is the minimal prime, and m=155 is the minimal m, even though the calculation doesn't show it.

But that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Hensel's step for p=17.

Wait, let me recompute Hensel's step.

We have f(n)=n⁴ +1.

We have n=2 mod17, f(n)=16+1=17≡0 mod17.

f'(n)=4n³=4*8=32≡15 mod17≠0.

Thus, unique solution exists.

So, n=2 +17k.

Compute f(2+17k) mod289.

As before, f(2+17k)=16 +4*8*17k + higher terms.

Which is 16 +544k mod289.

544 mod289=255, so 16 +255k ≡0 mod289.

255k≡-16 mod289.

But 255=15*17, 289=17².

So, 15k≡-16/17 mod17.

Wait, no, rather, 255k≡-16 mod289.

Divide both sides by 17:

15k≡-16/17 mod17.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, 255k≡-16 mod289.

Which is, 255k +16 ≡0 mod289.

Factor out 17: 17*(15k + something)≡0 mod17².

So, 15k + something ≡0 mod17.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 255k ≡-16 mod289.

So, 255k +16 ≡0 mod289.

Which is, 255k ≡-16 mod289.

255 and 289 have GCD 17.

So, divide both sides by 17:

15k ≡-16/17 mod17.

But -16/17 mod17 is equivalent to (-16)*17^{-1} mod17.

But 17≡0 mod17, so this is undefined.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should solve 255k ≡-16 mod289.

Which is, 255k +16 ≡0 mod289.

But 255=15*17, 16=16.

So, 15*17k +16 ≡0 mod17².

Which is, 17*(15k) +16 ≡0 mod17².

Which implies that 15k ≡(-16)/17 mod17.

But 17 is 0 mod17, so this is not possible.

Thus, there is no solution for k in this case.

Wait, that can't be right because Hensel's lemma says there's a unique solution.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 255k ≡-17 mod289, not -16.

Wait, earlier I had 255k≡-17 mod289.

Because f(n)=16 +255k ≡-1 mod289.

So, 16 +255k ≡-1 →255k ≡-17 mod289.

Ah, yes, that's where I went wrong earlier.

So, 255k≡-17 mod289.

Thus, 255k +17 ≡0 mod289.

Which factors as 17*(15k +1)≡0 mod17².

Which implies 15k +1 ≡0 mod17.

So, 15k ≡-1 mod17.

15≡-2 mod17.

So, -2k ≡-1 mod17 →2k ≡1 mod17.

k≡9 mod17.

So, k=9 +17m.

Thus, n=2 +17*9=155.

But as before, 155⁴≡15 mod289≠0.

Wait, but according to Hensel's lemma, there should be a solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let me compute (2 +17k)^4 mod289 again.

(2 +17k)^4=16 + 4*8*17k + 6*4*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But (17k)^2=289k²≡0 mod289.

So, up to the linear term: 16 +544k mod289.

544 mod289=544-289=255.

So, 16 +255k ≡-1 mod289.

255k ≡-17 mod289.

As before.

So, 255k ≡272 mod289.

Now, 255=15*17, 272=16*17.

Divide both sides by17:15k≡16 mod17.

15≡-2 mod17.

So, -2k≡16 mod17 →2k≡-16≡1 mod17.

k≡9 mod17.

Thus, k=9.

So, n=2+17*9=155.

But 155⁴≡15 mod289.

So, something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and p=17 is not suitable, and the minimal p is 41, with m=905.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that p=17 is the minimal prime, and m=155 is the minimal m, even though the calculation doesn't show it.

But that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that p=17 and m=155.

But given that 155⁴≡15 mod289, I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check another value of k.

Wait, perhaps k=9+17=26.

n=2 +17*26=2 +442=444.

Compute 444 mod289=444-289=155.

So, 444≡155 mod289. So, 444⁴≡155⁴≡15 mod289.

Same result.

Thus, it's not working.

Therefore, perhaps p=17 is not suitable, and the minimal prime is p=41, with m=905.

Thus, the minimal m is 905.

But that seems large, but perhaps that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a smaller m.

Wait, perhaps I should try n=  136.

n=136.

Compute 136 mod17=0. So, 136=17*8.

136⁴=(17*8)^4=17⁴*8⁴.

Thus, 136⁴≡0 mod289.

So, 136⁴+1≡1 mod289≠0.

No good.

n=  170: 170=17*10.

Okay, so I've been given this problem: Find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that for primes p, if p² divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod p². That implies n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p² because if I square both sides, (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² mod p², so n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². Therefore, the order of n modulo p² divides 8, right?

Wait, but the multiplicative order of n modulo p² must divide φ(p²) = p(p-1). So, the order of n modulo p² must divide both 8 and p(p-1). Hmm, maybe I can use this to find possible primes p.

Let me start by checking small primes to see if they satisfy the condition.

Starting with p=2. Let's see, does there exist n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 4? Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1,2,3.

n=1: 1 +1=2 → 2 mod 4 → not 0. n=2: 16 +1=17 → 1 mod 4. n=3: 81 +1=82 → 2 mod 4. So, no n makes n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod4. So p=2 is out.

Next prime p=3. Let's check if 3²=9 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let me compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8.

n=1:1 +1=2→2 mod9. n=2:16 +1=17→8 mod9. n=3:81 +1=82→1 mod9. n=4:256 +1=257→257 - 28*9=257-252=5→5 mod9. n=5:625 +1=626→626-69*9=626-621=5→5 mod9. Hmm, same as 4. Wait, perhaps a pattern.

Wait, maybe I can compute n⁴ mod9 more efficiently.

Since φ(9)=6, by Euler's theorem, n⁶ ≡1 mod9 for n coprime to 9. So, n⁴ ≡ n^{-2} mod9.

Let me compute for n=1: 1^{-2}=1, so 1 mod9. n=2: 2^{-2}= (2^2)^{-1}=4^{-1}=7 mod9 because 4*7=28≡1 mod9. So 2^4=16≡7 mod9. So 7+1=8≠0. n=2: 2⁴=16≡7 mod9. n=3: as above, 0 mod3, but 3²=9 divides n⁴ +1 only if n is multiple of 3, but n=3: 81+1=82≡1 mod9. So no luck.

n=4: 4≡4 mod9. 4²=16≡7, 4⁴=7²=49≡4 mod9. 4+1=5≡5≠0. n=4: n⁴=4 mod9, so 4+1=5.

n=5: 5 mod9, 5²=25≡7, 5⁴=7²=49≡4 mod9. 4+1=5≡5≠0.

n=6: 6⁴= (6²)^2=36²≡0 mod9, so 0 +1=1≡1≠0.

n=7: 7≡7 mod9. 7²=49≡4, 7⁴=4²=16≡7. 7+1=8≡8≠0.

n=8: 8≡8 mod9. 8²=64≡1, 8⁴=1²=1. 1+1=2≡2≠0.

So p=3 also doesn't work. No n makes n⁴ +1 divisible by 9.

Next prime p=5. Let's check if 25 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24, but that's a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since p=5, φ(25)=20, so n^20≡1 mod25 for n coprime to 25. So n^4 has order dividing 5 (since 20/4=5). So possible orders are 1,5.

If n^4 ≡ -1 mod25, then (n^4)^2= n^8≡1 mod25. So the order of n modulo25 would be 8, but 8 must divide φ(25)=20, which it doesn't. Wait, 8 and 20 have a GCD of 4. So the order must divide 4? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod25. Let me try small n:

n=2: 16 → 16 mod25. 16≠-1=24. n=3:81 mod25=6. 6≠24. n=4:256 mod25=6. 6≠24. n=5:0→0+1=1≡1≠0. n=7:7^2=49≡-1, so 7^4= (7^2)^2 ≡ (-1)^2=1 mod25. So 1+1=2≡2≠0. So n=7: n⁴=1 mod25, so n⁴+1=2 mod25.

n=1:1+1=2. n=2:16+1=17. n=3:81+1=82→82-3*25=7. n=4:256+1=257→257-10*25=257-250=7. n=5:0+1=1. n=6:6^4=1296 mod25: 1296 /25=51*25=1275, 1296-1275=21. So 21+1=22≡22≠0. n=7:1+1=2. n=8:8^4=4096. 4096 mod25: 25*163=4075. 4096-4075=21. 21+1=22≡22≠0. n=9:9^4=6561. 6561 mod25: 25*262=6550. 6561-6550=11. 11+1=12≡12≠0.

n=10: 10^4=10000→0 mod25. 0+1=1≠0. n=11:11^4= (121)^2= (121 mod25=21)^2=441 mod25=16. 16+1=17≠0. n=12:12^4=(144)^2=(144 mod25=19)^2=361 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0. n=13:13^4=(169)^2=(169 mod25=19)^2=361 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=14:14^4=(196)^2=(196 mod25=21)^2=441→16. 16+1=17≠0. n=15:0→0+1=1≠0. n=16:16^4=(256)^2=256 mod25=6, 6²=36→11. 11+1=12≠0. n=17:17^4= (289)^2= (289 mod25=14)^2=196→21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=18:18^4=(324)^2=(324 mod25=24)^2=576→576-23*25=576-575=1. 1+1=2≠0. n=19:19^4=(361)^2=(361 mod25=11)^2=121→21. 21+1=22≠0. n=20:0→0+1=1≠0. n=21:21^4=(441)^2=(441 mod25=16)^2=256→6. 6+1=7≠0. n=22:22^4=(484)^2=(484 mod25=9)^2=81→6. 6+1=7≠0. n=23:23^4=(529)^2=(529 mod25=4)^2=16. 16+1=17≠0. n=24:24^4=(576)^2=(576 mod25=1)^2=1. 1+1=2≠0.

Hmm, none of the n from 1 to 24 give n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25. So p=5 doesn't work either.

Next prime is p=7. Let's check if 49 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let me compute n⁴ mod49 for various n. Maybe there's a pattern.

Alternatively, since φ(49)=42, so n^42≡1 mod49. So n^4 has order dividing 42. If n^4 ≡ -1 mod49, then (n^4)^2= n^8≡1 mod49. So the order of n modulo49 would be 8. But 8 must divide φ(49)=42. Wait, 42 divided by 8 is 5.25, not integer. So 8 doesn't divide 42. Therefore, there is no n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49. Wait, does that mean p=7 is out?

Wait, perhaps my reasoning is wrong. Because maybe n^8 ≡1 mod49, but the order could be a divisor of 42. Let me check what the possible orders are. The multiplicative group modulo 49 is cyclic of order 42. So possible orders are the divisors of 42: 1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42. So n's order must be a divisor of 42. But n⁴ ≡ -1 implies that n⁸ ≡1, so the order must divide 8. But 8 doesn't divide 42, so the only common divisors are 1 and 2. So the order must be 2, but then n² ≡1 mod49. So n⁴≡1 mod49, but we need n⁴≡-1 mod49, which is impossible because 1≡-1 mod49 would imply 2≡0 mod49, which is not true. Therefore, p=7 also doesn't work.

Hmm, moving on to p=13. Wait, wait, wait, maybe I missed some primes. After 5 comes 7, then 11, 13, etc. Let me check p=13.

But before that, perhaps p=17? Wait, maybe I should think differently. Maybe the primes p where -1 is a quartic residue mod p².

I remember that for primes p ≡1 mod8, -1 is a square, but for quartic residues, the conditions are more restrictive.

Alternatively, maybe the primes p where the equation x⁴ ≡-1 mod p has a solution. If such a solution exists, perhaps it can be lifted to a solution modulo p².

Wait, but I need to have a solution modulo p². I think Hensel's lemma can help here. If f(x)=x⁴ +1, and if f(a)≡0 mod p, and f’(a) not ≡0 mod p, then there exists a unique lift modulo p².

So, first, I need to find primes p for which x⁴ ≡-1 mod p has a solution. So, for such a prime p, there exists a solution a with a⁴ ≡-1 mod p, and then if f’(a) not ≡0 mod p, then there exists a solution modulo p².

So, first, find the primes p for which x⁴ ≡-1 mod p is solvable.

Since x⁴ ≡-1 mod p implies that (-1) is a quartic residue mod p. For this to happen, the multiplicative order of -1 must divide (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Wait, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So, for -1 to be a quartic residue, it's necessary that (-1)^k ≡1 mod p for some k dividing (p-1)/4 or something?

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the equation x⁴ ≡-1 mod p.

Let me see, in the multiplicative group, which is cyclic of order p-1, the equation x^4 = -1 has a solution if and only if (-1) is in the subgroup generated by g^4, where g is a generator. So, the image of the map x→x^4 is a subgroup of index 4 in the multiplicative group. Thus, -1 must be in this subgroup. So, the order of -1 must divide the order of the subgroup, which is (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1).

Wait, the order of -1 is 2, since (-1)^2=1. So, for -1 to be in the image of x^4, 2 must divide the order of the image subgroup. The image subgroup has order (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). So, 2 divides (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). So, (p-1)/gcd(4,p-1) must be even.

Which implies that (p-1) must be divisible by 2 * gcd(4, p-1).

Let me think about possible cases.

Case 1: If p ≡1 mod4, since then gcd(4,p-1)=4 if p≡1 mod8, or 2 if p≡5 mod8.

Wait, let's list possible p:

If p ≡1 mod8: Then gcd(4,p-1)=4, so (p-1)/4 must be even, so (p-1)/4 must be even → p-1 ≡0 mod8. So p ≡1 mod8.

If p ≡5 mod8: Then gcd(4,p-1)=2, so (p-1)/2 must be even → p-1 ≡0 mod4 → p≡1 mod4. But 5 mod8 is already 1 mod4. So for p≡5 mod8, (p-1)/2 is even only if p≡5 mod8 and (p-1)/2 is even → p-1 ≡0 mod4 → p≡1 mod4, but p≡5 mod8 is 5 mod8, which is 1 mod4. So p≡5 mod8: (p-1)/2 is even? Let's see: If p=5, p-1=4, (p-1)/2=2, which is even. If p=13, p-1=12, (p-1)/2=6, even. So for p≡5 mod8, (p-1)/2 is even if p≡5 mod8. Wait, yes, because p=8k+5, so p-1=8k+4=4(2k+1), which is divisible by 4. So (p-1)/2=2(2k+1), which is even. So for p≡5 mod8, (p-1)/2 is even.

Wait, but in this case, for p≡5 mod8, the image subgroup has order (p-1)/2, which is even. So yes, -1 is in the image subgroup. Therefore, x^4 ≡-1 mod p has a solution when p≡1 mod8 or p≡5 mod8.

Wait, but let me check for p=13, which is 5 mod8. Does x^4 ≡-1 mod13 have a solution?

Let me compute x^4 mod13 for x=1 to 12.

x=1:1, 2:16≡3, 3:81≡3, 4:256≡9, 5:625≡625-48*13=625-624=1. So 5^4=625≡1 mod13. Hmm, 1 is not -1. Let me try x=8:8^4= (8^2)^2=64^2=4096 mod13. Let me compute 8 mod13=8. 8²=64≡12 mod13. 12²=144≡1 mod13. So 8^4≡1 mod13. Not -1.

x=2: 16≡3. x=3: 81≡3. x=4:256≡9. x=5:1. x=6: 6^4=1296. 1296 mod13: 13*99=1287. 1296-1287=9. So 9≡9. x=7:7^4= (49)^2. 49≡10 mod13. 10^2=100≡9 mod13. So 9. x=8:1 as above. x=9:9^4= (81)^2≡(3)^2=9. x=10:10^4= (100)^2≡(9)^2=81≡3. x=11:11^4= (121)^2≡(4)^2=16≡3. x=12:12^4= (144)^2≡(1)^2=1.

So, x^4 mod13 is either 1,3,9. So -1 mod13 is 12, which doesn't appear. So x^4≡-1 mod13 has no solution. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So perhaps my conditions are not correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. For x^4 ≡-1 mod p to have a solution, the multiplicative order of x must be 8, which requires that 8 divides p-1. Because in the multiplicative group mod p, which has order p-1, the order of x must divide p-1. So if 8 divides p-1, then there exists an element of order 8, so x^4 can be -1. Because (-1) has order 2, so if there's an element of order 8, then x^4 would be -1.

Wait, but in the case of p=13, p-1=12, which is not divisible by 8. So 8 doesn't divide 12, so there's no element of order 8, hence x^4 can't be -1 mod13. So my earlier conclusion was wrong. Only primes p where 8 divides p-1 will have solutions to x^4 ≡-1 mod p.

So, the condition is that p ≡1 mod8. Because if p≡1 mod8, then p-1 is divisible by 8, so the multiplicative group has an element of order 8, so x^4 can be -1.

Wait, let me test p=17, which is 1 mod8. Let's see if x^4 ≡-1 mod17 has a solution.

Compute x^4 mod17 for x=1 to 16.

x=1:1 mod17=1. x=2:16. x=3:81≡13. x=4:256≡1. x=5:625≡625-36*17=625-612=13. x=6:1296 mod17. 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4. So 4. x=7:7^4= (49)^2= (49-2*17=15)^2=225≡4 mod17. x=8:8^4= (64)^2= (64-3*17=13)^2=169≡16 mod17. 16≡-1 mod17. Oh! So x=8:8^4≡16≡-1 mod17. So yes, p=17 has a solution x=8 where x^4 ≡-1 mod17.

Great, so for p=17, x=8 is a solution. Now, using Hensel's lemma, can we lift this solution to modulo p²=289?

Hensel's lemma says that if f(x)=x^4 +1, and f(a)≡0 mod p and f’(a) not≡0 mod p, then there exists a unique lift a + kp such that f(a + kp)≡0 mod p². So let's compute f’(a)=4a³.

For a=8, f’(8)=4*8³=4*512=2048. Now, compute 2048 mod17. Since 17*120=2040, 2048-2040=8. So f’(8)≡8 mod17≠0. Therefore, Hensel's lemma applies, and there exists a unique solution modulo p²=289.

Thus, p=17 is a candidate. Now, is there any smaller prime than 17 that satisfies the condition? Let's check primes between 7 and17: 11,13.

Wait, p=13: as above, no solution to x^4 ≡-1 mod13.

p=11: Let's see if x^4 ≡-1 mod11 has a solution. Compute x^4 mod11 for x=1 to 10.

x=1:1. x=2:16≡5. x=3:81≡4. x=4:256≡256-23*11=256-253=3. x=5:625≡625-56*11=625-616=9. x=6:1296≡1296-117*11=1296-1287=9. x=7:2401≡2401-218*11=2401-2398=3. x=8:4096≡4096-372*11=4096-4092=4. x=9:6561≡6561-596*11=6561-6556=5. x=10:10000≡10000-909*11=10000-9999=1. So x^4 mod11 yields 1,3,4,5,9. -1 mod11 is 10, which isn't in the list. So p=11 doesn't work.

So the next prime after 7 is 11, which doesn't work, then 13 doesn't work, then 17 works.

So p=17 is the least prime for which there exists n (like 8) such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

Now, the second part: find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

So, we need to find the smallest m where m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

From Hensel's lemma, we know that the solution mod17 lifts uniquely to a solution mod289. So m ≡8 mod17. So let's write m=8 +17k, where k is an integer we need to find.

We want (8 +17k)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Let me compute (8 +17k)^4 mod289. Since 17²=289, higher powers of 17 will vanish mod289. So, expand using binomial theorem:

(8 +17k)^4 = 8^4 + 4*8³*(17k) + 6*8²*(17k)^2 + 4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But mod289, (17k)^2=289k²≡0, so any terms with (17k)^2 or higher will be 0 mod289. So,

(8 +17k)^4 ≡8^4 + 4*8³*(17k) mod289.

Compute each part:

8^4=4096. 4096 mod289: Let's compute 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So 8^4≡50 mod289.

4*8³=4*(512)=2048. 2048 mod17: as before, 2048≡8 mod17. Wait, but we need mod289. Let's compute 2048 /289: 289*7=2023, 2048-2023=25. So 4*8³≡25 mod289.

So, 4*8³*(17k)=25*(17k)=425k. 425 mod289: 289*1=289, 425-289=136. So 425k≡136k mod289.

So putting it all together:

(8 +17k)^4 ≡50 +136k mod289.

We need this ≡-1 mod289. So,

50 +136k ≡-1 mod289 → 136k ≡-51 mod289.

But -51 mod289 is 238. So,

136k ≡238 mod289.

Now, solve for k: 136k ≡238 mod289.

First, find the inverse of 136 mod289.

Compute GCD(136,289):

289 ÷136=2 with remainder 17 (289=2*136 +17).

136 ÷17=8 with remainder 0. So GCD is17. Wait, but 17 divides both 136 and 289, so 136 and289 are not coprime. Therefore, the equation 136k ≡238 mod289 has a solution only if 17 divides238.

Check: 238 ÷17=14, since 17*14=238. So yes, 17 divides238. Therefore, the equation reduces to:

(136/17)k ≡238/17 mod289/17 → 8k≡14 mod17.

Because 136=17*8, 238=17*14, 289=17².

So now, solve 8k≡14 mod17.

Find the inverse of8 mod17. 8*x≡1 mod17.

Testing x=15:8*15=120≡120-7*17=120-119=1 mod17. So inverse is15.

Thus, k≡14*15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, 210-204=6. So k≡6 mod17.

So k=6 +17t, for integer t.

But since we're looking for the smallest positive m, which is m=8 +17k, and k=6 is the smallest positive solution. So m=8 +17*6=8+102=110.

Wait, let me check m=110. Compute 110⁴ +1 mod289.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me compute it step by step.

First, compute 110 mod289=110.

Compute 110²=12100. 12100 mod289: Let's divide 12100 by289.

289*41=289*40=11560, +289=11560+289=11849.

12100-11849=251. So 110²≡251 mod289.

Now, compute 110^4=(110²)^2=251²=63001. 63001 mod289.

Compute 289*217=289*(200+17)=57800 +4913=62713.

63001-62713=288. 288 mod289=288. So 110^4≡288 mod289.

So 110^4 +1≡288 +1=289≡0 mod289. So yes, m=110 works.

But wait, is there a smaller m than110? Because m=8+17k with k=6 gives m=110. But perhaps k=6 is the minimal positive solution, but maybe there's a smaller m in the range 1 to288?

Wait, since m must be ≡8 mod17, the possible m's would be 8,25,42,59,76,93,110,... We tested m=8: 8^4=4096 mod289=50≡50≠-1=288. So m=8 doesn't work.

Next, m=25: Let's compute 25^4 mod289.

25²=625 mod289. 289*2=578, 625-578=47. So 25²≡47 mod289.

25^4=(47)^2=2209 mod289.

Compute 289*7=2023, 2209-2023=186. So 25^4≡186 mod289. 186+1=187≡187≠0.

Next, m=42:42 mod289=42.

42²=1764. 289*6=1734, 1764-1734=30. So 42²≡30 mod289.

42^4=30²=900 mod289. 289*3=867, 900-867=33. So 42^4≡33. 33+1=34≠0.

m=59:59 mod289=59.

59²=3481. 3481 mod289: 289*12=3468. 3481-3468=13. So 59²≡13 mod289.

59^4=13²=169 mod289. 169+1=170≠0.

m=76:76 mod289=76.

76²=5776. 289*20=5780. 5776-5780= -4≡285 mod289. So 76²≡285.

76^4=285²=81225. Compute 81225 mod289.

289*280=289*(200+80)=57800 +23120=80920.

81225 -80920=305. 305-289=16. So 76^4≡16 mod289. 16+1=17≠0.

m=93:93 mod289=93.

93²=8649. 289*29=8381. 8649-8381=268. So 93²≡268.

93^4=268²=71824. Compute 71824 mod289.

289*248=289*(200+48)=57800 +13872=71672.

71824-71672=152. So 93^4≡152. 152+1=153≠0.

Next, m=110: as above, 110^4≡288 mod289, so 288+1=289≡0. So m=110 works.

So the minimal m is110. But wait, let me check if there's a smaller m in the form 8 +17k where k=6 is the minimal solution. Since k=6 gives m=110, and the previous k=5 gives m=8+17*5=8+85=93, which we already checked and didn't work. So yes, 110 is the smallest m.


The least prime \( p \) for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is \( p = 17 \). To find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \), we solve the congruence \( m^4 \equiv -1 \mod 289 \). Using Hensel's lemma, we lift the solution \( m \equiv 8 \mod 17 \) to \( m = 8 + 17k \). Solving for \( k \), we find \( k = 6 \), giving \( m = 8 + 17 \times 6 = 110 \). Thus, the least positive integer \( m \) is:

\boxed{110}
