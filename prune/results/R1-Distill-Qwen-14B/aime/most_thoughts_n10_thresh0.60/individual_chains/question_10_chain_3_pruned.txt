Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand this. So A is a set that Alice picks, and then Bob is considering all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of elements in A.

First, let me think about what Bob is doing. For each element a in A, he can form sets B where the maximum element is a. So each a in A contributes some number of sets to Bob's list.

Let's try to count how many sets B have maximum element a. If the maximum is a, then the other elements of B must be less than a. So the elements of B can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, but since B must be nonempty, the number of possible sets is 2^{a-1} - 1. Wait, no. Wait, if the maximum is a, then the other elements are from 1 to a-1, but B can include any non-empty subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, but wait, no, actually, B is a set with maximum a, so the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set. But since B itself must be non-empty, even if there are no other elements, just {a} is allowed. So the number of possible sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}, because for each element less than a, it can be either included or not. So the number is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, that makes sense. For example, if a=1, then the only set is {1}, so that's 1 set, which is 2^{0}=1. If a=2, the possible sets are {2} and {1,2}, which is 2 sets, and 2^{1}=2. For a=3, it's 4 sets: {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}, which is 4=2^2. So yes, it's 2^{a-1} for each a.

So the total number of sets in Bob's list is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. So sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of elements in A, which is sum_{a in A} a.

So first, we have sum_{a in A} 2^{a -1} = 2024. So we need to find a set A such that when we take 2^{a-1} for each a in A and sum them, we get 2024. Then, once A is determined, sum all the a's.

Now, the problem is to find all possible sets A where the sum of 2^{a-1} is 2024, and then find the sum of A's elements.

Wait, but the problem says that A is a set, so the elements are unique. So A is a set of distinct positive integers. So we need to find a set A such that sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Hmm, so I need to write 2024 as a sum of distinct terms of the form 2^{k}, where k is a non-negative integer. Wait, because each term is 2^{a-1}, so if a-1 is k, then a = k+1. So each term is 2^k, and each a is k+1, where k is the exponent.

Wait, but each term is 2^{a-1}, so the terms are all powers of two, but the exponents are a-1
