Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me read it again carefully.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, we need to calculate the probability of both A and B happening (which is just A, since if you win the grand prize, you automatically win a prize) divided by the probability of B.

So, let's break it down. First, I need to find P(B), which is the probability that Jen wins at least two numbers, and then P(A), which is the probability she wins all four.

But wait, actually, since A is a subset of B (because winning the grand prize means she also has at least two correct numbers), P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B).

Let me compute the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That is the combination C(10,4). Let me calculate that:

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, there are 210 possible combinations for the lottery.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since Jen has picked 4 specific numbers, there is only 1 favorable outcome (the lottery also picks those same four). So, P(A) = 1/210.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, the lottery is choosing 4 numbers, and if Jen's 4 numbers exactly match, then she wins the grand prize. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (the specific set Jen chose), so yes, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, that is the probability that the lottery picks 4 numbers, and at least two of them are among Jen's four.

To compute this, it's easier to compute the complementary probability and subtract from 1. The complementary event is that fewer than two numbers are chosen, i.e., zero or one number is chosen.

So, P(B) = 1 - [P(no numbers chosen) + P(exactly one number chosen)].

First, let's compute P(no numbers chosen). That means all four lottery numbers are chosen from the remaining 6 numbers not in Jen's set. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4). Let me compute that:

C(6,4) = 15.

So, the number of ways to have no numbers chosen is 15. Thus, P(no numbers chosen) = 15/210 = 1/14.

Next, compute P(exactly one number chosen). That is, the lottery picks 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6. The number of ways is C(4,1)*C(6,3).

Compute C(4,1) = 4, and C(6,3) = 20.

So, the number of ways is 4*20=80.

Thus, P(exactly one number chosen) = 80/210 = 8/21.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - (1/14 + 8/21). Let's compute this:

First, convert 1/14 and 8/21 to a common denominator. The least common denominator is 42.

1/14 = 3/42, and 8/21 = 16/42.

So, 3/42 + 16/42 = 19/42.

Thus, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = 23/42.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. The total number of cases where fewer than two are chosen is 15 (no numbers) + 80 (one number) = 95. So, 95/210 is the probability for the complementary event.

Wait, 95/210 reduces to 19/42, which is the same as before. So, yes, P(B) is 1 - 19/42 = 23/42. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to compute P(B) is to sum the probabilities of exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 numbers being chosen.

Let me check that way as a verification.

Number of ways to choose exactly k numbers from Jen's 4 is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k). So:

For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90.

For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) =4*6=24.

For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

So, total number of favorable outcomes is 90 +24 +1= 115.

Thus, P(B) = 115/210 = 23/42. That's the same as before, so that's correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) divided by (23/42).

Compute that:

(1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23).

Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times (since 42*5=210). So, 42/210 = 1/5.

Therefore, (1/5)/23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 42/(2
