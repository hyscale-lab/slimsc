Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. The key thing here is that each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that means I can't just consider rectangles formed by any four points; they have to align with the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, it's possible to form rectangles by connecting vertices in a symmetrical way. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, which is even, I can imagine that it's symmetric enough to have multiple rectangles.

I think the approach would be to figure out how many pairs of parallel sides there are in the dodecagon because each rectangle is formed by two pairs of parallel sides. So, if I can count the number of such pairs, I can then find the number of rectangles by considering combinations of these pairs.

Wait, but how do I count the number of parallel sides and diagonals in a regular dodecagon?

In a regular n-gon, the number of sides is n, and the number of diagonals is n(n-3)/2. But here, we're not just counting sides and diagonals, but specifically looking for parallel ones.

In a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if they are separated by the same number of steps. For example, in a hexagon (6-gon), each side has a parallel side three steps away. Similarly, in an octagon (8-gon), each side has a parallel side four steps away.

So, in a dodecagon, for each side, there are other sides that are parallel. How many? Let's think about the step size. For a dodecagon, the polygon is 12-sided, so stepping k vertices apart will give a diagonal or side. But when is it parallel?

In a regular polygon, two sides (or a side and a diagonal) are parallel if the number of steps between the vertices is the same. So, for a dodecagon, step size can vary from 1 to 5 because stepping 6 would give a diameter (which isn't a side or a diagonal, but a straight line passing through the center), stepping 7 would be same as stepping 5 in the opposite direction, etc.

Wait, but for sides, stepping 1 gives the adjacent vertices. So, how do we find the number of sets of parallel sides and diagonals?

I think each direction corresponds to a certain step size. For step size k, where k ranges from 1 to 5, because stepping 6 would be diametrically opposite, which isn't a side or a diagonal but a straight line.

Wait, no. For a regular polygon with even sides, stepping k and stepping n/2 -k would result in the same length but in opposite directions. So, for a dodecagon (n=12), stepping k and stepping 12/2 -k =6 -k would give parallel lines.

Wait, that's only
