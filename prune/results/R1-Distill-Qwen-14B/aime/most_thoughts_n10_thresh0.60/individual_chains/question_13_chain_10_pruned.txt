Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop visits. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. So, her walk is 9 kilometers each time. She walks at a constant speed, which is denoted as 's' kilometers per hour. When she walks at this speed 's', the entire walk takes her 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. 

Wait, so the total time she spends is 4 hours, and part of that is walking, and the rest is in the coffee shop. So, if I think about this, the time she spends walking is 4 hours minus t minutes. But t is in minutes, and her walking speed is in hours, so I should probably convert t into hours to keep the units consistent.

Let me write down what I know:

1. Distance walked: 9 km
2. Speed: s km/h
3. Total time including coffee shop: 4 hours
4. When she walks faster, at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which includes the same t minutes.

So, the second scenario is when her speed is increased by 2 km/h, making it s + 2. The total time here is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, this includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So in both cases, the time she spends in the coffee shop is the same, which is 't' minutes. So, the difference in total time must be due to the difference in walking time because she's changing her speed.

So, maybe I can set up two equations based on these two scenarios.

First, when her speed is 's':

Walking time = 4 hours - t minutes.

But I need to convert t minutes into hours because the speed is in km per hour. So, t minutes is t/60 hours. Therefore, walking time is (4 - t/60) hours.

But walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed, which is 9/s.

So, equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, for the second scenario where her speed is s + 2:

Walking time = (2 hours 24 minutes) - t minutes.

Again, convert 2 hours 24 minutes into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. Then, the walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours.

But walking time is also 9/(s + 2).

So, equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Now, I have two equations:

1. 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2. 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I need to solve for s and t. Once I have those, I can find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

So, let's write them again:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t. But maybe it's better to express t from one equation and substitute into the other.

Let me rearrange equation 1 to solve for t:

From equation 1:
9/s = 4 - (t/60)
=> t/60 = 4 - (9/s)
=> t = 60*(4 - 9/s)
=> t = 240 - (540/s)

Similarly, from equation 2:
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)
=> t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)
=> t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s + 2))
=> t = 144 - (540/(s + 2))

Now, I have expressions for t from both equations. Since both equal to t, I can set them equal to each other.

So, 240 - (540/s) = 144 - (540/(s + 2))

Let me write that:

240 - (540/s) = 144 - (540/(s + 2))

Now, let's move all terms to one side:

240 - 144 = (540/s) - (540/(s + 2))

Simplify left side: 96 = 540*(1/s - 1/(s + 2))

Compute the right side:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = (s + 2 - s)/(s*(s + 2)) ) = 2/(s*(s + 2))

So, 96 = 540*(2)/(s*(s + 2))

Compute that: 96 = (1080)/(s*(s + 2))

Multiply both sides by s*(s + 2):

96 * s*(s + 2) = 1080

Simplify:

96s(s + 2) = 1080

Divide both sides by 96:

s(s + 2) = 1080 / 96

Let me compute 1080 / 96:

Divide numerator and denominator by 24: 45 / 4 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Which is a quadratic equation:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me write it as:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

To solve for s, use quadratic formula:

s = [-2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) )]/(2*1)
s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2
s = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2
sqrt(49) is 7.

So, s = (-2 +7)/2 or (-2 -7)/2

First solution: (5)/2 = 2.5 km/h

Second solution: (-9)/2 = -4.5 km/h. But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, that seems a bit slow for a walking speed, but okay, maybe Aya walks slowly.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t.

Using equation 1:

t = 240 - (540/s)

s = 2.5, so 540/2.5 = 216

So, t = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes.

Wait, t is 24 minutes. Hmm, that seems reasonable.

Let me check with equation 2:

t = 144 - (540/(s + 2))

s + 2 = 4.5 km/h

540 / 4.5 = 120

So, t = 144 - 120 = 24 minutes. Perfect, same result. Good.

So, s is 2.5 km/h, t is 24
