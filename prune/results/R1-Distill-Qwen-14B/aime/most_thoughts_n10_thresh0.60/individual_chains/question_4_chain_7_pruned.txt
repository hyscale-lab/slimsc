Alright, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 give Bob a winning strategy, regardless of Alice's moves. Hmm, okay.

First off, let's think about the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with perfect information, so each player knows the state of the game at all times. The key here is to determine the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, Bob can only have a winning strategy if the starting position n is a losing position for Alice. So, my first task is to figure out which values of n are losing positions.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when n=0, which is an L position because the game has ended, and the player who just took the last token has won. Wait, actually, if n=0, the player to move loses because there are no tokens left to take. Hmm, that's an important point.

Wait, let's clarify. If it's your turn and n=0, you can't move, so you lose. So, n=0 is a losing position.

Now, for n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is W.

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who then can take it and win. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait: If n=2, you take 1, opponent gets n=1 and takes it to win. So if you take 1, opponent wins. Alternatively, can you take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So you can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position? Wait, no, because if I'm at n=2 and I have to take 1
