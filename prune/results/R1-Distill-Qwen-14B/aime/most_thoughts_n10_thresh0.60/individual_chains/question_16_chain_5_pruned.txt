Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me make sure I understand it correctly. The problem says:

Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Alright, so I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, using that \( p \), find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let me break it down. First, find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). Then, find the minimal \( m \) for that \( p \).

I think I should start by checking small primes and see if any of them satisfy the condition. The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Let me start with \( p = 2 \).

Check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Let's compute \( n^4 + 1 \) mod 4.

For any integer \( n \), \( n \) mod 4 can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Compute \( n^4 \) mod 4:

- If \( n \equiv 0 \mod 4 \): \( n^4 \equiv 0^4 = 0 \mod 4 \)
- If \( n \equiv 1 \mod 4 \): \( n^4 \equiv 1^4 = 1 \mod 4 \)
- If \( n \equiv 2 \mod 4 \): \( n^4 = 16 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)
- If \( n \equiv 3 \mod 4 \): \( n^4 = 81 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)

So \( n^4 \) is either 0 or 1 mod 4, so \( n^4 +1 \) is either 1 or 2 mod 4.

So, \( n^4 +1 \) can be 1 or 2 mod 4, which means it's never 0 mod 4. Therefore, \( p = 2 \) is not possible because \( p^2 = 4 \) doesn't divide \( n^4 +1 \) for any \( n \).

So, next prime is 3.

Check if \( 3^2 = 9 \) divides \( n^4 +1 \) for some \( n \).

Let's compute \( n^4 +1 \) mod 9 for various \( n \).

Possible residues mod 9 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Compute \( n^4 \) mod 9:

- \( 0^4 = 0 \)
- \( 1^4 = 1 \)
- \( 2^4 = 16 \equiv 7 \mod 9 \)
- \( 3^4 = 81 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \)
- \( 4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 16^2 = 256 \equiv 256 - 28*9=256-252=4 mod 9
- \( 5^4 = (5^2)^2 = 25^2 = 625 \equiv 625 - 69*9=625-621=4 mod 9
- \( 6^4 = (6^2)^2 = 36^2 = 1296 \equiv 0 mod 9 \)
- \( 7^4 = (7^2)^2 = 49^2 = 2401. Let's compute 2401 mod 9: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod 9
- \( 8^4 = (8^2)^2 = 64^2. 64 mod 9 is 1, so 1^2=1 mod 9.

So, n^4 mod 9 can be 0,1,4,7.

Therefore, \( n^4 +1 \) mod 9 can be:

- 0+1=1
- 1+1=2
- 4+1=5
- 7+1=8

So, the possible residues are 1, 2, 5, 8. None of these are 0 mod 9. Hence, \( p=3 \) doesn't work either.

Next prime is 5. Let's check \( p=5 \).

Check if \( 5^2 =25 \) divides \( n^4 +1 \) for some \( n \).

So, need to find \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 25 \).

Which is equivalent to \( n^4 \equiv 24 \mod 25 \).

I think I can compute \( n^4 \) mod 25 for n from 1 to 24 (since mod 25 repeats every 25 numbers). But that's a bit tedious.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to check if -1 is a quartic residue mod 25.

But perhaps first, let's check if -1 is a quadratic residue mod 5. Because if it's a quadratic residue, then maybe we can find a quartic residue.

Wait, but mod 5: -1 is 4, which is a quadratic residue because 2^2=4 mod 5.

But does that help? Maybe not directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Euler's theorem. Since 25 is 5^2, and phi(25)=20.

So, for n coprime to 25, n^20 ≡1 mod25.

So, n^4k ≡1 mod25 when n is coprime.

But I'm looking for n^4 ≡24 mod25.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for n such that n^2 ≡ something mod25, so that when I square it again, I get 24.

Let me compute squares mod25 first.

Compute n^2 mod25 for n=1 to 12 (since beyond 12, it's symmetric):

n | n^2 mod25

1:1

2:4

3:9

4:16

5:0

6:36-25=11

7:49-2*25= -1=24

8:64-2*25=14

9:81-3*25=6

10:100-4*25=0

11:121-4*25=121-100=21

12:144-5*25=144-125=19

So n^2 mod25 can be 0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24.

So, to find n^4 ≡24 mod25, which is equivalent to (n^2)^2 ≡24 mod25.

So, let me look for whether 24 is a square mod25. But looking at the squares above, 24 is achieved by n=7. So 7^2=49≡24 mod25.

So, 24 is a square mod25. Therefore, to find n^4 ≡24 mod25, we can have n^2 ≡7 mod25 or n^2≡-7 mod25. Wait, because (n^2)^2=24. So, if x^2=24, then x= sqrt(24) mod25. Which would be ±7, since 7^2=49≡24 mod25.

Wait, so x=±7, which would imply that n^2 ≡7 mod25 or n^2≡-7 mod25. But wait, 7 mod25 is 7, and -7 mod25 is 18.

So, need to see if 7 and 18 are quadratic residues mod25.

From the n^2 mod25 table above, n^2=7: looking at the results, I don't see 7 in the squares. The squares are 0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24. So 7 is not a square mod25. Similarly, 18 is also not in the list.

So, n^2 ≡7 mod25 has no solution, same for n^2≡18 mod25.

Hmm, so that suggests that even though 24 is a square mod25, its square roots (7 and 18 mod25) aren't squares themselves. Therefore, there is no n such that n^4 ≡24 mod25.

Wait, so does that mean that \( p=5 \) also doesn't work? Because there's no n where n^4 +1 is divisible by 25.

Hmm, but wait, did I make a mistake here?

Because if n^4 ≡24 mod25, and 24 is a square, but its roots are not squares, then there is no solution.

So, perhaps \( p=5 \) is also invalid.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, n^4 ≡24 mod25. So, if there exists an n such that n^4 ≡24 mod25, then p=5 is a candidate. But from the above, since the only squares mod25 are certain residues, and 7 is not among them, so even
