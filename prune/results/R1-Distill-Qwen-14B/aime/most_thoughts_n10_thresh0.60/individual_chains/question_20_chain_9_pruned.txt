Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to break it down. 

The problem says there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable. So, I don't care which specific white or black chip goes where, just the count and their positions matter. The grid has 25 unit cells, and each cell can hold at most one chip. 

The conditions are:
1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, any extra chip placed would violate the first two conditions. So, the grid should be as full as possible without being able to add another chip without breaking the first two rules.

Hmm, that third condition is interesting. It means that the placement is maximal. So, we can't add any more chips without causing a row or column to have mixed colors.

Let me think about how to model this. Each row must be all white or all black, and each column must be all white or all black. So, for each row, I choose a color, and similarly for each column. But wait, there's a conflict here because the color chosen for a row affects the columns and vice versa.

Wait, actually, since each row must be uniform, and each column must be uniform, the entire grid must be a kind of checkerboard pattern. Or maybe a block pattern where certain rows and columns are white, and others are black. But wait, no, because each row and column individually must be uniform, but they can vary across the grid.

Let me think of it as a binary matrix where each entry is either white or black. But with the constraints that each row is all one color and each column is all one color. So, each row is either all white or all black, and the same for each column.

Wait, but if a row is all white, then every column that intersects this row must also be all white. Because if any column that intersects this row is black, then that cell would have a white chip but the column is black, which is a conflict. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Suppose row i is all white. Then, for each column j, the cell (i,j) is
