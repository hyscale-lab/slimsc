Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction and find p + q where the fraction is p/q with p and q coprime.

Let me start by understanding the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We're supposed to find the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. The radius of this sphere is r, and we need to find r², which will be a fraction p/q. Then, sum p and q.

So, the key steps I think are:

1. Model the rectangular box with variables for length, width, height.
2. Set up the equations for surface area and volume.
3. Express the sphere's radius in terms of the box's dimensions.
4. Find the maximum possible space diagonal of the box, since the sphere's diameter must at least equal the box's space diagonal.
5. Then, minimize r², which is (space diagonal / 2)², so it's (space diagonal)² / 4.

Wait, but the sphere must contain each box, so the sphere has to be large enough to contain any box in set B. Therefore, the radius r must be at least half of the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B.

So, first, let me define the variables.

Let the box have dimensions x, y, z. So, volume V = xyz = 23.

Surface area S = 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54.

We need to find the maximum possible space diagonal, which is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Then, r would be half of that, so r = (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, to minimize r², we need to minimize (x² + y² + z²), but wait, no. Wait, actually, for each box, the sphere must contain it. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain all such boxes. So, the radius r must be at least the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. So, to find the minimal r, we need to find the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, and then r is half of that.

Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, the key is to maximize x² + y² + z² under the constraints of given surface area and volume.

Hmm. How do I approach this optimization problem?

I remember that for optimization under constraints, we can use Lagrange multipliers, but since this is an algebra problem, maybe there's a way to express variables in terms of each other or use inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps assume the box is
