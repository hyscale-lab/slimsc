Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, A is a set of positive integers. Bob is considering all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. And the total number of such B's is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Wait, so Bob's list includes all possible finite nonempty sets B where max(B) is in A. So, for each element m in A, how many sets B are there where the maximum is m?

Right, if m is in A, then any set B with max(B) = m must consist of m and any subset of the positive integers less than m. But B has to be non-empty, so for each m, the number of such B's would be 2^{m-1}. Because for each element less than m, you can choose whether to include it or not in B. So the total number of possible subsets is 2^{m-1}, but since B has to be non-empty, that's actually 2^{m-1} because m is always included. Wait, no, wait. If I include m, then the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m-1}. So the number of possible B's with max(B) = m is 2^{m-1}. Because for each of the m-1 numbers less than m, you can choose to include or exclude them. So yes, that's 2^{m-1}.

So the total number of such B's is the sum over m in A of 2^{m - 1}.

And according to the problem, this sum is 2024. So we have:

Sum_{m in A} 2^{m - 1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of the elements in A, which is Sum_{m in A} m.

So, we need to find a set A where the sum of 2^{m -1} over all m in A is 2024, and then compute the sum of m in A.

Hmm, okay, so this seems like a problem where we can model the possible A's as binary numbers or something. Because 2^{m-1} is similar to binary digits.

Wait, 2024 is the sum of 2^{m-1} for m in A. So, perhaps A is a set of exponents such that when we add up 2^{m-1} for each m, it equals 2024.

So, maybe we can represent 2024 in binary and then see which bits are set. Each set bit would correspond to a term 2^{k}, so perhaps m-1 corresponds to k, so m = k+1.

Wait, let me think. Let me write 2024 in binary to see what it is.

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2=506, rem 0.

506/2=253, rem 0.

253/2=126 rem 1.

126/2=63 rem 0.

63/2=31 rem 1.

31/2=15 rem 1.

15/2=7 rem 1.

7/2=3 rem 1.

3/2=1 rem 1.

1/2=0 rem 1.

So writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0.

Wait, let's count the bits. Let me compute 2^0 =1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, ..., up to 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048.

Wait, 2024 is less than 2048, so let's see:

2024 in binary.

Let me compute 1024 (2^10) is 1024, subtract that from 2024: 2024 - 1024 = 1000. So the 11th bit (2^10) is set.

Now, 1000: 512 (2^9). 1000 -512=488. Bit 10 is set.

488: 256 (2^8). 488-256=232. Bit 9 set.
