Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about finding the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f and g are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all the absolute value signs. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I think I should understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. Both are transformations of the absolute value function, so they should have V-shapes, but with some modifications.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's consider the inner part first: |x|. That's a standard V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. That would shift the graph down by 1/2. But wait, it's inside another absolute value: ||x| - 1/2|. So taking the absolute value of |x| - 1/2. This means wherever |x| - 1/2 is negative, it becomes positive.

So, when is |x| - 1/2 negative? That would be when |x| < 1/2. So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, and then taking the absolute value would flip it to positive. So f(x) would be a V-shape that's been modified. Let me think: at x = 0, |0| - 1/2 = -1/2, absolute value is 1/2. So f(0) = 1/2. At x = 1/2, |1/2| -1/2 = 0, so f(1/2) = 0. Similarly at x = -1/2, same value. Then, for |x| > 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is positive, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So the graph would look like a V that's been inverted between -1/2 and 1/2 and then continues as a V outside that. So f(x) has a W-shape, actually, with minima at x = ±1/2, y=0, and peaks at x=0, y=1/2.

Similarly, let's look at g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Again, starting with |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So the inner function |x| - 1/4 is negative when |x| < 1/4. So between -1/4 and 1/4, g(x) becomes |(|x| - 1/4)| = (1/4 - |x|). For |x| >= 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4. So g(x) would be a V-shape that's flipped between -1/4 and 1/4. So at x=0, g(0) = 1/4. At x=±1/4, g(x)=0, and for |x|>1/4, it's |x| - 1/4, so V-shape again. So g(x) has a W-shape with minima at x=±1/4, y=0, and peaks at x=0, y=1/4.

So f(x) and g(x) are both W-shaped functions with specific parameters.

Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So both are transformations of sine and cosine functions, then passed through f and g, scaled by 4.

Let me first consider y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break it down:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1, since the period of sin(2πx) is 2π/(2π) = 1. So it's a sine wave that oscillates between -1 and 1, completing a full cycle every 1 unit along the x-axis.

2. Then, apply f to it: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let me think about what this does. For sin(2πx) between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value, it becomes between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, no, actually, wait. Let me plot f(x) again. For x in [0,1], f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |, so for |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. For |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

So when we have f(sin(2πx)), which is f of a function that oscillates between -1 and 1, but since we have |sin(2πx)|, it's between 0 and 1. So let's consider |sin(2πx)|, which is a wave that goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0 every 1/2 units. So for each x, |sin(2πx)| is in [0,1].

So f(|sin(2πx)|) is:

- For |sin(2πx)| <= 1/2: f(|sin(2πx)|) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|
- For |sin(2πx)| > 1/2: f(|sin(2πx)|) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2

But since |sin(2πx)| is symmetric and non-negative, we can just think about it as:

f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)| when |sin(2πx)| <= 1/2, and |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 otherwise.

So f(sin(2πx)) will oscillate between 0 and 1/2. Because when |sin(2πx)| is 1/2, f is 0, and when |sin(2πx)| is 0 or 1, f is 1/2.

Wait, when |sin(2πx)| is 0, f is ||0| -1/2| = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 1, f is |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 1/2, f is |1/2 -1/2|=0. So in between, it's a V-shape, either increasing or decreasing. So f(sin(2πx)) is a function that for each x, it's 1/2 - |sin(2πx)| when |sin(2πx)| <=1/2, and |sin(2πx)| -1/2 otherwise.

So it's a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with a period of 1/2, because sin(2πx) has a period of 1, but since we're taking |sin(2πx)|, the period is halved to 1/2.

Then, applying g to f(sin(2πx)): g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| -1/4|. But since f(sin(2πx)) is always non-negative, this is just |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

So g(f(sin(2πx))) = |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

So let's analyze g(f(sin(2πx))).

First, since f(sin(2πx)) ranges between 0 and 1/2, the expression f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4 will range between -1/4 and 1/4. So taking the absolute value, g(f(sin(2πx))) will range between 0 and 1/4.

Specifically:

- When f(sin(2πx)) >= 1/4, then g(f(...)) = f(...) - 1/4.
- When f(...) < 1/4, g(...) = 1/4 - f(...).

So, let me think about the graph of g(f(...)). It will have sections where it's increasing and decreasing, based on the value of f(...).

Then, multiply by 4: 4g(f(...)) = 4 * |f(...) - 1/4|.

So 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is:

- 4*(f(...) - 1/4) when f(...) >= 1/4
- 4*(1/4 - f(...)) when f(...) < 1/4

This simplifies to:

- 4f(...) -1 when f(...) >= 1/4
- 1 -4f(...) when f(...) < 1/4

So, the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will oscillate between 0 and 1, since:

- When f(...) is 1/2, 4g(f(...)) is 4*(1/2 - 1/4) = 4*(1/4)=1.
- When f(...) is 0, 4g(...)=4*(1/4 -0)=1, but wait, no. Wait, when f(...) is 0, which is less than 1/4, so 4*(1/4 -0)=1. When f(...) is 1/2, which is greater than 1/4, 4*(1/2 -1/4)=1 as well. Wait, so the maximum value is 1, and the minimum value is when f(...) is 1/4. Let me compute:

When f(...) =1/4, 4g(f(...))=4*|1/4 -1/4|=0. So the function y oscillates between 0 and 1.

Wait, but let's think again. When f(...) is 1/4, 4g(f(...)) is 0. When f(...) is 0, 4g(f(...)) is 1. When f(...) is 1/2, 4g(f(...)) is 4*(1/2 -1/4)=1. So the function y oscillates between 0 and 1.

So, the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1, with a certain period and shape.

Similarly, the other function is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's analyze this.

Same steps:

1. cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 2/(3π) * 2π = 2/3? Wait, actually, the period of cos(ky) is 2π/k. So cos(3πy) has period 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So it completes a full cycle every 2/3 units along the y-axis.

2. Take |cos(3πy)|, so it's between 0 and 1, with a period of 1/3 (since |cos(3πy)| has half the period of cos(3πy)).

3. Apply f: f(|cos(3πy)|) is again:

- 1/2 - |cos(3πy)| when |cos(3πy)| <=1/2
- |cos(3πy)| -1/2 when |cos(3πy)| >1/2

So f(|cos(3πy)|) is a function that varies between 0 and 1/2.

4. Then apply g to f(...): g(f(|cos(3πy)|)) = |f(...) -1/4|.
