Okay, so I have this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to understand what it's asking. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which is a given for everyone. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, some own a garden spade, and all own the candy hearts. 

The problem states that 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Additionally, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's the fourth item. 

It also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these items. Hmm, okay. 

I think this is a problem about sets and Venn diagrams. We can model the ownership of these items as overlapping sets. Since there are four items, but everyone owns the candy hearts, that might simplify things a bit because every resident is at least in the candy hearts set. 

Let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. For four sets A, B, C, D, the total number of elements is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the four-way intersection. But wait, in this case, since everyone owns the candy hearts, that's like the universal set. So D (candy hearts) has 900 elements. 

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- A: owns a diamond ring (195)
- B: owns a set of golf clubs (367)
- C: owns a garden spade (562)
- D: owns a bag of candy hearts (900, since everyone owns this)

We are to find the number of people who own all four, which is |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|. 

But the problem gives some other information: 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Wait, so these are the counts for exactly two and exactly three, not at least two or three. 

Hmm, I think I can approach this using the inclusion-exclusion principle, but with the given counts of exactly two and exactly three. 

Wait, let me think. The inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But since D is the universal set (everyone owns D), the union |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| is just 900. 

So plugging in the numbers:

900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A∩D| + |B∩C| + |B∩D| + |C∩D|) + (|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D|) - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, D is the universal set, so any intersection involving D is just the other sets. For example, |A∩D| is just |A|, because everyone in A also owns D. Similarly, |A∩B∩D| is just |A∩B|, because D is universal. And |A∩B∩C∩D| is just |A∩B∩C|, since D is already included. So this might simplify things.

Let me substitute these. 

First, |D| is 900. |A| is 195, |B| is 367, |C| is 562. 

So substituting:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 
- (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A| + |B∩C| + |B| + |C|) 
+ (|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) 
- |A∩B∩C|

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. Let's go step by step.

Each pairwise intersection:
- A∩B: people who own both A and B
- A∩C: people who own both A and C
- A∩D: same as A, since D is universal
- B∩C: people who own both B and C
- B∩D: same as B
- C∩D: same as C

So the sum of pairwise intersections is |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A| + |B∩C| + |B| + |C|

Similarly, for the triple intersections:
- A∩B∩C: people who own A, B, C
- A∩B∩D: same as A∩B
- A∩C∩D: same as A∩C
- B∩C∩D: same as B∩C

So the sum of triple intersections is |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|

And the four-way intersection is |A∩B∩C∩D|, which is the same as |A∩B∩C|.

So putting it all together:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 
- (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A| + |B∩C| + |B| + |C|)
+ (|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|)
- |A∩B∩C|

Simplify the right-hand side.

Let me compute the constants first. 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124, plus 900 is 2024.

So:

900 = 2024 
- (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + 195 + |B∩C| + 367 + 562)
+ (|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|)
- |A∩B∩C|

Let me write this out step by step.

Compute the sum of all pairwise intersections: 

Sum = |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A| + |B∩C| + |B| + |C|
= (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) + (195 + 367 + 562)
= (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) + 1124

Similarly, the triple intersections:

Sum = |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|
= |A∩B∩C| + (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|)

Now, substituting back into the equation:

900 = 2024 
- [ (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) + 1124 ]
+ [ |A∩B∩C| + (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) ]
- |A∩B∩C|

Let me distribute the negative sign:

900 = 2024 - (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) - 1124 
+ |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|
- |A∩B∩C|

Now, let's look for terms that cancel out. 

- The (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) terms appear with a negative and then a positive, so they cancel each other.

- The |A∩B∩C| term appears once positive and once negative, so they also cancel.

So what's left? 

2024 - 1124 = 900

Wait, 2024 - 1124 is 900, right? Because 2024 - 1000 is 1024, then subtract 124 more: 1024 - 124 = 900.

So, 900 = 900. 

Hmm, that's an identity. That suggests that this approach isn't giving me new information. So I need another way to find the number of people who own all four.

Wait, perhaps I should use the given information about exactly two and exactly three. 

The total number of residents is 900. These are partitioned into those who own exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, exactly four, or none of the items. But since everyone owns the candy hearts, which is one item, no one owns none. So, the counts are:

Number owning exactly one: let's call this x
Number owning exactly two: 437
Number owning exactly three: 234
Number owning exactly four: y (this is what we're trying to find)
So, x + 437 + 234 + y = 900

So, x + y = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, x + y = 229.

But I don't know x or y yet. So I need another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total number of ownerships. Each person's number of items is counted. So, the total number of items owned is equal to sum of the sizes of each set. 

Wait, |A| is 195, |B| 367, |C| 562, and |D| 900. So the total number of items is 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = let's compute that.

195 + 367 = 562. 562 + 562 = 1124. 1124 + 900 = 2024.

So total ownerships are 2024.

But this total is also equal to the sum over all residents of the number of items they own. 

So, if I denote:

- Number of people owning exactly 1 item: x → each contributes 1 → total contribution x
- Exactly 2: 437 → each contributes 2 → total 874
- Exactly 3: 234 → each contributes 3 → total 702
- Exactly 4: y → each contributes 4 → total 4y

So, the total ownerships are x + 874 + 702 + 4y = 2024.

So, x + 4y = 2024 - (874 + 702) = 2024 - 1576 = 448.

So, x + 4y = 448.

Earlier, we had x + y = 229.

So now, we can solve these two equations:

Equation 1: x + y = 229
Equation 2: x + 4y = 448

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(x + 4y) - (x + y) = 448 - 229
3y = 219
y = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, y = 73. That means 73 residents own all four items.

Wait, let me double-check this. So, solving for x, from equation 1: x = 229 - y = 229 -73= 156.

So, x=156, y=73.

Let me confirm the total ownerships: x + 437*2 + 234*3 + y*4.

x=156, so 156 + 437*2 + 234*3 +73*4.

Compute each term:

156 is just 156.

437*2: 874.

234*3: 702.

73*4: 292.

Add them up: 156 + 874 = 1030; 1030 +702=1732; 1732 +292=2024.

Which matches the total ownerships. So that's correct.

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given information about residents owning exactly two or three items. 

Let:
- \( x \) be the number of residents owning exactly one item.
- \( y \) be the number of residents owning all four items.

We know:
1. The total number of residents is 900, so:
   \[
   x + 437 + 234 + y = 900 \implies x + y = 229
   \]
2. The total number of ownerships is the sum of all residents' items, which equals 2024 (from the sizes of A, B, C, and D). This can be expressed as:
   \[
   x \cdot 1 + 437 \cdot 2 + 234 \cdot 3 + y \cdot 4 = 2024
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   x + 874 + 702 + 4y = 2024 \implies x + 4y = 448
   \]

We now solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 229 \\
x + 4y = 448
\end{cases}
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[
3y = 219 \implies y = 73
\]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \( \boxed{73} \).
