Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. The chips can be either white or black, but each cell can hold at most one chip. There are 25 white and 25 black chips available. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for the columns. Also, any additional chip would violate these conditions. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I think about the constraints. Each row and each column must have chips of a single color. So, for a given row, it can either have all white chips, all black chips, or no chips at all. The same applies to each column. But wait, since the chips are indistinct beyond their color, I don't have to worry about which specific white or black chip goes where, just the color.

Now, the key is that any additional chip would violate the conditions. That suggests that the placement is maximal; you can't add any more chips without breaking the same-row or same-column color rule. So, the current configuration must be such that every empty cell is in a row and column that are both already fully colored. Because if there's an empty cell that's in a row with some white chips and a column with some black chips, you could potentially add a chip of either color, which would violate the conditions. So to prevent that, every empty cell must be in a row that's completely filled with chips of one color and a column that's completely filled with chips of another color. Or maybe both the row and column are completely filled?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If a row has all its cells filled with white chips, then you can't add any more chips in that row. Similarly for a column. So, for a cell to be empty, its row must be incomplete and its column must be incomplete. Because if the row was complete, you couldn't add a chip there; same for the column. But if the row is incomplete, you can't add a chip of a different color, because all chips in the same row must be the same color. Similarly for the column.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since each row must be all one color
