Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be in the form m√n/p, and then I need to find m + n + p where m and p are coprime and n is square-free. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

Looking at the edge lengths, AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). Hmm, interesting, this seems symmetric. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I think such a tetrahedron is called isohedral or maybe isohedral, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key point is that opposite edges are equal, which might imply some symmetry that I can exploit.

I remember that in such symmetric tetrahedrons, the volume can be calculated using a formula similar to Heron's formula for triangles, but extended to three dimensions. Alternatively, since the edges are equal in pairs, perhaps I can model this tetrahedron in a coordinate system to calculate the volume.

Let me try that approach. Let's place the tetrahedron in 3D space. Maybe place point A at (0, 0, 0). Then, since some edges are equal, perhaps I can place the other points symmetrically.

Wait, to make it easier, maybe I can consider vectors for the edges. Alternatively, since opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron is "equifacial," meaning all its faces are congruent. Wait, no, not necessarily. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I've heard of it before, but I'm not exactly sure how it works. Let me recall.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

CM = | 0  1    1    1    1  |
        | 1  0   a²  b²  c² |
        | 1  a²  0   d²  e² |
        | 1  b² d²  0   f² |
        | 1  c² e² f²  0  |

The volume V is then sqrt( CM / 288 ), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, no, the determinant itself is 288 V², so V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). So, if I can compute the determinant, I can find V.

Given that, let's assign the edge lengths correctly. Let me list all the edges:

AB = sqrt(41) => AB² = 41

AC = sqrt(80) => AC² = 80

AD = sqrt(89) => AD² = 89

BC = sqrt(89) => BC² = 89

BD = sqrt(80) => BD² = 80

CD = sqrt
