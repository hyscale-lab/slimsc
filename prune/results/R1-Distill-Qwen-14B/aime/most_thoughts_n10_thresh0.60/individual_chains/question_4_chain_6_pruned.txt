Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, regardless of Alice's play.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game. It's a turn-based game with two players, Alice and Bob. The game starts with n tokens. Each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The key here is to determine for which n Bob can force a win, no matter how Alice plays.

I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, for this problem, we need to find the losing positions n where Bob can make a move that leads Alice into another losing position, eventually leading to Alice being unable to move and thus losing.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote P(n) as the position where there are n tokens left. We can classify P(n) as either a winning (W) position or a losing (L) position.

The base case would be P(0), which is a losing position because there are no tokens left to take, so the player who cannot move loses. Wait, no, actually, in this problem, the player who takes the last token wins. So P(0) would mean that the previous player has just taken the last token and wins. Therefore, P(0) is a losing position for the current player because they can't make a move.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let's define P(n) as the position with n tokens. If from P(n), all possible moves (i.e., subtracting 1 or 4) lead to a position where the opponent can win, then P(n) is a losing position. Conversely, if there's at least one move that leads to the opponent being in a losing position, then P(n) is a winning position.

So, for P(n), if either P(n-1) or P(n-4) is a losing position, then P(n) is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

Let me try to compute the first few positions to see if there's a pattern.

Start with n=0: P(0) is a losing position because you can't move.

n=1: The player can take 1 token, leaving 0, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(1) is a winning position.

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Alternatively, can't take 4. So all moves lead to the opponent being able to win. So P(2) is a losing position.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm getting this right.

Wait, for n=2, the player can take 1 token, leaving n=1, which is
