Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are a bit complicated, so I'll need to break them down step by step.

First, let's parse the functions. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. Then, the graphs are given by:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

I need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations. That is, I need to solve the system where both equations hold true simultaneously.

Let me start by understanding what f and g do. Both are transformations involving absolute values and shifts.

For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's think about this. The inner |x| makes a V-shape graph. Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down, but since we're taking the absolute value again, it reflects any negative parts back up. So f(x) is a V-shape that's shifted and then reflected. The result is a W-shaped graph with a minimum at x=0, x=1/2, x=-1/2, and so on.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. This is similar to f, but shifted less. So g(x) would also be a W-shaped graph, but with minima at x=0, x=1/4, x=-1/4, etc.

Next, let's think about how f and g are composed with sine and cosine functions.

Looking at y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break this down:

- Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1 because the coefficient of x is 2π. So sin(2πx) varies between -1 and 1 as x increases.

- Then, f is applied to this sine function: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's analyze this. The inner absolute makes it non-negative, subtracting 1/2, and then taking absolute again.

- Then, g is applied to the result: g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|. Wait, no, actually, g is ||x| - 1/4|, so it's applied directly to f(sin(2πx)).

- Finally, this is multiplied by 4: 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))). So the entire expression for y is 4 times this transformed sine function.

Similarly, for x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))):

- Start with cos(3πy). The cosine function has a period here of 2/3 because the coefficient is 3π. It varies between -1 and 1 as y increases.

- Then, f is applied: f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|.

- Then, g is applied: g(f(cos(3πy))) = ||f(cos(3πy))| - 1/4|.

- Multiply by 4: 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) gives the x-value.

So, to find the intersections, I need to find all (x, y) such that:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

This looks symmetrical in a way, but not entirely because the coefficients inside the sine and cosine functions are different (2π vs 3π).

Let me try to analyze the ranges of these functions first.

What's the range of y?

First, sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1. Then f(sin(2πx)) is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's see the possible values.

Let me denote z = |sin(2πx)|, so z is between 0 and 1.

Then f(z) = |z - 1/2|. So f(z) ranges from 0 (when z=1/2) up to 1/2 (when z=0 or z=1). So f(z) can be between 0 and 1/2.

Then g(f(z)) is ||f(z) - 1/4|. Let me denote w = f(z), which is between 0 and 1/2.

So g(w) = | |w| - 1/4 |. Since w is between 0 and 1/2, |w| is just w. So g(w) = |w - 1/4|.

So when w is between 0 and 1/4, g(w) = 1/4 - w. When w is between 1/4 and 1/2, g(w) = w - 1/4.

So the range of g(w) is from 0 (at w=1/4) up to 1/4 (when w=0 or w=1/2).

Then, multiplying by 4, 4 * g(w) ranges from 0 to 1.

So y = 4 g(f(z)) is between 0 and 1. Similarly, x is also between 0 and 1 because the same reasoning applies to the other function.

So both x and y are in [0,1]. That's a useful constraint.

Now, let's try to find all (x, y) in [0,1] x [0,1] that satisfy both equations.

Since the functions are periodic, perhaps I can model this as a system where x and y are related via these transformed sine and cosine functions.

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can consider plotting or analyzing the behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of solutions by analyzing the possible intersections.

Let me think about the functions f and g in more detail.

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So, for x >= 0, it's |x - 1/2|. So for x >= 1/2, it's x - 1/2. For x < 1/2, it's 1/2 - x.

Then, since it's symmetric for negative x, f(x) is a V shape at x=0, then another V at x=1/2 and x=-1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So for x >= 0, it's |x - 1/4|. So for x >= 1/4, it's x - 1/4, for x < 1/4, it's 1/4 - x. Again, symmetric for negative x.

Now, when we apply f to sin(2πx), we have f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1.

So f(sin(2πx)) is | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Let me consider |sin(2πx)| as z, so z is between 0 and 1.

So f(z) = |z - 1/2|.

Similarly, when we compute g(f(z)) = | |f(z)| - 1/4 |.

Since f(z) is between 0 and 1/2, we can ignore the outer absolute and just write |f(z) - 1/4|.

So, for f(z) in [0, 1/4], g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z).

For f(z) in [1/4, 1/2], g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4.

Then, 4*g(f(z)) would be 4*(1/4 - f(z)) = 1 - 4f(z) when f(z) <= 1/4, and 4*(f(z) - 1/4) = 4f(z) - 1 when f(z) >= 1/4.

So, substituting f(z) = |z - 1/2|, which is | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled, perhaps I can think of the entire transformation as a piecewise function
