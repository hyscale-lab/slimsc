Okay, so I've come across this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. The question is asking how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, I remember this is a type of combinatorial game theory problem. It involves figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this game, since Alice goes first, if she's faced with a losing position, Bob can win. Therefore, the problem is to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win with optimal play.

To approach this, I think I should start by analyzing small values of n and see if I can find a pattern or recurrence relation.

Let's start from n=1:
- If n=1, Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, Bob can't win here. This is a winning position for Alice.

n=2:
- Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. But wait, if Bob is left with 1, he can take it and win. So, Alice would lose if she takes 1. Alternatively, Alice can't take 4 because n=2 is less than 4. So, she must take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then wins. Wait, that's bad for Alice. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Hmm, but wait, if Alice takes 1 from 2, Bob is left with 1. Then Bob can take 1 and win. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, no, because if Alice is forced to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Alice can't force a win when n=2. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

Wait, maybe I
