Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that log base a of b is equal to c can be rewritten in exponential form as a^c = b. So maybe I can convert both of these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Rewriting that, it becomes x^10 = y^x. That's because the logarithm is telling me that x raised to the 10th power equals y raised to the xth power. Okay, got that.

Now the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, this becomes y^10 = x^{4y}. So y raised to the 10th power equals x raised to the 4y. Hmm, interesting. So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find xy. Maybe I can find a relationship between x and y from these equations.

Looking at the first equation, x^10 = y^x. Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponents. So, ln(x^10) = ln(y^x). Applying the logarithm power rule, that becomes 10 ln x = x ln y. So equation 1 becomes:

10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation, y^10 = x^{4y}. Taking natural logs again, ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y}). Which gives 10 ln y = 4y ln x. So equation 2 becomes:

10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now I have two equations:

1. 10 ln x = x ln y
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, perhaps I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let me try to express ln y from equation 1. From equation 1:

ln y = (10 ln x) / x.

Now substitute this into equation 2. So equation 2 becomes:

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

Wait, let me write that out:

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

Simplifying the left side: 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, so 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Assuming ln x is not zero, which it can't be because x > 1, so ln x is positive. So I can divide both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y.

So 100 / x = 4y. Let me solve for y in terms of x:

y = (100 / x) / 4 = 25 / x.

So y equals 25 divided by x. Okay, that's a nice relationship. So y = 25/x.

Now, I can substitute this back into one of the earlier equations to solve for x. Let's use equation 1: 10 ln x = x ln y.

We know y is 25/x, so ln y is ln(25/x). Let's compute that:

ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x.

So equation 1 becomes:

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x).

Let me write that out:

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x.

Let me bring all terms to one side to see if I can factor or solve for x.

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln 25 = 0.

Factor out ln x:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln 25 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Let me rearrange the terms:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln 25.

Factor out ln x on the left:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25.

So,

ln x = [x ln 25] / (10 + x).

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky because x is in the numerator and denominator. Maybe I can let t = x, and then write it as:

ln t = [t ln 25] / (10 + t).

This looks like a transcendental equation, which might not have a closed-form solution, but perhaps we can find a clever substitution or test possible integer values for x and see if they fit.

Given that x and y are both greater than 1, and y = 25/x, so if x is 5, y would be 5 as well. Let me test x = 5.

If x =5, then y would be 25/5=5.

Let me check equation 1: log_x(y^x) = log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) = 5, but the problem says it should be 10. So that's not correct.

Wait, that's a problem. So x =5 doesn't work because it gives 5 instead of 10. So I need a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of x, using y = 25/x, and then find an equation in x only.

Wait, let me consider that equation 1 is x^10 = y^x. Since y =25/x, plug that in:

x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Which is x^10 = 25^x / x^x.

Multiplying both sides by x^x:

x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Hmm, so x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Taking both sides to the power of (1/x):

x^{(10 + x)/x} = 25.

Simplify the exponent:

(10 + x)/x = 10/x + 1.

So,

x^{10/x + 1} = 25.

Hmm, that's x^{(10/x) +1} =25.

Let me set t = x^{1/x}. Then, x^{1/x} = t.

So, x^{(10/x)} = (x^{1/x})^{10} = t^{10}.

Thus, the equation becomes:

t^{10} * x =25.

But since t =x^{1/x}, we have:

x =25 / t^{10}.

But t =x^{1/x}, so substituting back:

x =25 / (x^{1/x})^{10} =25 / x^{10/x}.

So,

x * x^{10/x} =25.

Which is x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Hmm, but that's the same as earlier. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can take natural logs again on both sides of x^{10 +x} =25^x.

So,

ln(x^{10 +x}) = ln(25^x).

Which becomes:

(10 +x) ln x =x ln25.

Wait, that's the same as equation 1 and 2 combined earlier. So perhaps going back, I need to find a better way.

Wait, from earlier steps, we had:

ln x = [x ln25 ] / (10 +x).

Let me denote t =x.

So,

ln t = (t ln25)/(10 + t).

Hmm. Let's rearrange:

(10 + t) ln t = t ln25.

So,

10 ln t + t ln t - t ln25=0.

Hmm
