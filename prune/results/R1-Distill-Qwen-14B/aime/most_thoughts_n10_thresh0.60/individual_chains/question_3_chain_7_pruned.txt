Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. The question is about finding the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize (if she wins the grand prize, she definitely wins a prize), then P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the probability we need is P(A) / P(B), where A is winning the grand prize and B is winning any prize.

Wait, let me think again. Yes, because if you condition on having won a prize (event B), then the probability of having won the grand prize is the probability of A divided by the probability of B. So, I need to compute both P(A) and P(B).

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways 4 numbers can be chosen from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4). Let me compute that: C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers.

Now, event A: winning the grand prize. That means all four of Jen's numbers are the ones chosen. Since Jen picks 4 specific numbers, there's only one way this can happen. So, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1. Thus, P(A) is 1/210.

Next, event B: winning a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. So, we need to compute the number of ways where at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. Let me think about how to compute this.

Alternatively, it might be easier to compute the probability of the complementary event (not winning a prize) and subtract it from 1. The complementary event is that Jen's numbers have fewer than two matches, i.e., zero or one match with the randomly chosen numbers. So, let's compute the number of ways where she has zero matches and the number of ways where she has exactly one match.

But wait, actually, maybe it's better to compute directly the number of favorable outcomes for B. So, B is the
