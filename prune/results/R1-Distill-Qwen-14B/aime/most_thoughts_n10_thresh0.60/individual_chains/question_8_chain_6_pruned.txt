Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums and products of variables, sometimes factoring or symmetric expressions can help. The given equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, so maybe I can rewrite it in a way that takes advantage of that symmetry.

Looking at the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, I notice that it can be factored. Let me try to factor it. Each term is a product of two variables, one squared. So, perhaps I can factor by grouping.

Wait, another approach: maybe express the given expression in terms of (a + b + c) and other symmetric sums. Let me recall that in symmetric expressions, we often use elementary symmetric sums like σ1 = a + b + c, σ2 = ab + bc + ca, and σ3 = abc.

Given that σ1 = a + b + c = 300, which is given. Now, let's see if I can express the given expression in terms of σ1, σ2, and σ3.

The expression is E = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let's see:

E = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)
But since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into E:
E = a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)
= 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

So now, E = 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

Hmm, okay. I need to express this in terms of σ1, σ2, σ3.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, let's write that down.

a³ + b³ + c³ = σ1³ - 3σ1σ2 + 3σ3

Similarly, a² + b² + c² can be written as (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = σ1² - 2σ2.

So substituting these into E:

E = 300(σ1² - 2σ2) - (σ1³ - 3σ1σ2 + 3σ3)

We know σ1 is 300, so let's plug that in:

E = 300(300² - 2σ2) - (300³ - 3*300*σ2 + 3σ3)
= 300*(90,000 - 2σ2) - (27,000,000 - 900σ2 + 3σ3)
= 27,000,000 - 600σ2 - 27,000,000 + 900σ2 - 3σ3
= (27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600σ2 + 900σ2) -3σ3
= 0 + 300σ2 - 3σ3
= 300σ2 - 3σ3

So, E = 300σ2 - 3σ3, and we know E is 6,000,000. So,

300σ2 - 3σ3 = 6,000,000

We can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100σ2 - σ3 = 2,000,000

So, σ3 = 100σ2 - 2,000,000

Now, we have σ1 = 300, σ3 = 100σ2 - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now we have two equations involving σ2 and σ3. But how can we use this?

I remember that for three variables a, b, c, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is x³ - σ1x² + σ2x - σ3 = 0.

So, substituting σ1 = 300 and σ3 = 100σ2 - 2,000,000, the polynomial becomes:

x³ - 300x² + σ2x - (100σ2 - 2,000,000) = 0

Let me write that as:

x³ - 300x² + σ2x - 100σ2 + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, I can factor out σ2 from the middle terms:

x³ - 300x² + σ2(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I can think of σ2 as a variable and see if the equation can be rewritten in terms that relate σ2 and the other terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to the possible integer solutions.

Wait, another thought: since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps I can consider the cases where one or two of them are zero. Let me see.

Case 1: All of a, b, c are positive integers.

Case 2: Exactly two of them are zero.

Case 3: Exactly one of them is zero.

Wait, but since a + b + c = 300, if two are zero, the third must be 300. If one is zero, then the other two sum to 300.

But let me check the given equation E = 6,000,000. Let's see what happens in these cases.

Case 2: Suppose two variables are zero, say b = c = 0. Then a = 300.

Compute E: a²b + ... all terms. Since b and c are zero, all terms except a²b and a²c would be zero, but b and c are zero, so E would be zero. But E is 6,000,000, so this case is impossible. Similarly, any case where two variables are zero won't satisfy E = 6e6. So, Case 2 is invalid.

Case 3: Suppose exactly one variable is zero. Let's say c = 0. Then a + b = 300, and E becomes:

a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300.

So, E = 300ab = 6,000,000.

So, 300ab = 6,000,000 → ab = 20,000.

So, in this case, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

So, we can solve for a and b. Let me see.

We can model this as quadratic equation: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Compute discriminant: 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Square root of 10,000 is 100, so solutions are:

x = [300 ± 100]/2 → x = (400)/2 = 200 or x = (200)/2 = 100.

So, a and b are 200 and 100. So, the triple in this case would be (200, 100, 0), but since c is zero, and also considering permutations (since c could be any of the variables), we can have three cases: c=0, b=0, or a=0.

So, for each choice of which variable is zero, we get two solutions (since a and b can be 200 and 100 in either order). So, 3 variables to choose which is zero, each giving two solutions, so 3 * 2 = 6 solutions in this case.

Wait, but let me confirm: for c=0, the solutions are (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Similarly, for b=0, we get (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). For a=0, we get (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). So yes, 6 solutions.

Case 3 gives 6 solutions.

Case 1: All variables positive. So, a, b, c ≥ 1.

Wait, in this case, we have a + b + c = 300 and E = 6,000,000.

But earlier, we had σ1 = 300, σ3 = 100σ2 - 2,000,000.

So, from the polynomial equation, perhaps we can find constraints on σ2.

Wait, let's think about the cubic equation with roots a, b, c:

x³ - 300x² + σ2x - σ3 = 0

But σ3 = 100σ2 - 2,000,000, so substituting:

x³ - 300x² + σ2x - (100σ2 - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + σ2x - 100σ2 + 2,000,000 = 0

We can factor this as:

x³ - 300x² + σ2(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, but I don't see an immediate way to factor this further. Maybe we can think about possible integer roots?

Wait, if a, b, c are integers, then the polynomial must have integer roots. So, the possible roots are factors of the constant term, which is 2,000,000 - 100σ2. Hmm, but this seems complicated because σ2 is also a variable.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of σ2 as a variable itself and see if the equation can be rewritten in terms of σ2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express everything in terms of σ2.

We have σ3 = 100σ2 - 2,000,000.

But in the polynomial, the roots are a, b, c. So, for the cubic equation to have integer roots, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

But the cubic equation is x³ - 300x² + σ2x - σ3 = 0, which is x³ - 300x² + σ2x - (100σ2 - 2e6) = 0.

This might get too complicated. Maybe another strategy: let's think about variables in terms of two variables since a + b + c = 300. Let me set c = 300 - a
