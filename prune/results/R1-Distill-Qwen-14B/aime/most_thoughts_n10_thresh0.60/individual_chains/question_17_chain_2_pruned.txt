Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let's recall that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, and z. So, the surface area S of a rectangular box is given by the formula S = 2(xy + yz + xz). The volume V is given by V = xyz.

In this problem, the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. So, we have:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. xyz = 23

We need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The minimal sphere would be the one where the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is given by d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2 = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, our goal is to find the minimal possible value of (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Wait, but actually, we need the minimal sphere that can contain all such boxes. So, perhaps the minimal sphere is determined by the maximum space diagonal among all possible boxes in set B. So, we need to find the maximum value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all x, y, z satisfying the surface area and volume conditions. Then, r would be half of that maximum space diagonal, and r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4 for that particular x, y, z.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal enclosing sphere must have a radius that can contain all boxes in B, so perhaps the maximum space diagonal across all boxes in B is the one that determines r. So, perhaps I need to maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

But wait, actually, the problem states that r is the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in B. So, for each box in B, the sphere must contain it. Therefore, the sphere must have a radius at least as large as the space diagonal of any box in B. Therefore, r is equal to the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B divided by 2. So, to find r, I need to find the maximum possible value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23. Then, r is half of that maximum. So, r² is (x² + y² + z
