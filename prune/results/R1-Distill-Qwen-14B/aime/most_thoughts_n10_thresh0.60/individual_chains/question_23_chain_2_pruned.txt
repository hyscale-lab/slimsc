Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, yes, they are. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's correct.

Given that, the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals pass through the origin, and their intersection is at the origin.

Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since the diagonals bisect each other, the origin is the midpoint of both AC and BD. So, if I can find points A, B, C, D such that all are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin, then ABCD is a rhombus.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1, I think. Or wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular. Let me check that.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because a rhombus is a special kind of parallelogram where all sides are equal, and in this case, the diagonals are
