Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, so essentially, I need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD², but not necessarily attainable.

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, maybe I was confused. Let me check.

No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, no, now I'm getting confused. Let me think. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not equal unless it's a square. But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Oh, yes, right, because the adjacent angles are supplementary, and the diagonals bisect those angles, leading to right angles between the diagonals. So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, okay, then.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals of the rhombus are lines passing through the origin, and their intersection is at the origin. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, they can be considered as the axes of the hyperbola? Wait, not necessarily, because the hyperbola has its own axes. But
