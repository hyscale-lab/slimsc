Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that maps all the blue vertices to where the red ones were originally. The answer should be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue independently with equal probability. So, each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red or blue.

The key here is that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were initially. So, the rotation would map blue to red positions.

Wait, that sounds like the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you can rotate the octagon so that all blue are on red positions, that means the blue set is a rotation (by some number of steps) of the red set.

But since it's a regular octagon, rotations can be by 0°, 45°, 90°, and so on, up to 315°, corresponding to shifts of 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.

So, perhaps we need to consider the number of colorings where the blue vertices are a rotation of the red vertices. But how exactly?

Wait, another way: the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices. So, this would imply that the set of blue vertices is a cyclic shift of the set of red vertices by some k positions, for k = 0,1,...,7.

But maybe that's getting ahead of myself. Let me think about what it means for such a rotation to exist.

Suppose the original coloring has R red vertices and B blue vertices, with R + B = 8. If a rotation exists that maps all blue vertices to red positions, then the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, because each blue would be mapped to a unique red. Otherwise, if R ≠ B, such a rotation can't exist. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, because suppose R = B = 4, then it's possible that the blue vertices form a shifted version of the red ones. But if R ≠ B, like R = 5 and B = 3, then it's impossible for a rotation to map the 3 blue vertices to the 5 red ones. So, for such a rotation to exist, R must equal B, i.e., exactly 4 red and 4 blue vertices.

So, the first thing is that the number of red and blue vertices must be equal. So, the probability we're looking for is conditional on having exactly 4 red and 4 blue vertices.

But wait, the problem says "the probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, perhaps it's not just about having 4 red and 4 blue, but that the blue set is a rotated version of the red set. But maybe regardless of the number, but in this case, since the number of blue and red must match, it's necessary that R = B.

Wait, no, if you have, say, 2 red and 6 blue, then you can't have a rotation mapping all blue to red positions, because there are more blue than red. So, the first condition is that the number of blue equals the number of red, which is 4 each.

So, the first step is to calculate the probability that there are exactly 4 red and 4 blue vertices. Then, among those colorings, how many of them have the blue vertices arranged as a rotation of the red ones.

So, the total number of colorings with exactly 4 red and 4 blue is C(8,4) = 70. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

But wait, the problem is about the probability that such a rotation exists, so the probability is (number of colorings where blue is a rotation of red
