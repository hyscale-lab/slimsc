Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that ω is a complex number satisfying ω^13 = 1. So, ω^k for k from 0 to 12 gives all the 13th roots of unity. Since ω ≠ 1, we're considering the primitive roots.

The expression inside the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. I wonder if I can simplify this expression somehow. Let me denote ω^k as x for a moment. Then, the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x². Let me write that as x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in x. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots?

Let me try to compute the discriminant of this quadratic. The discriminant D is b² - 4ac, which here is (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are complex. The roots would be [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, 2 - 2x + x² = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Wait, that's interesting. So, for each k, the term in the product is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Hmm, so that product can be written as the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 - i)). So, it's the product over all 13th roots of unity of (x - (1 + i)) times the same for (1 - i).

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) for k from 0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, but wait, no. Actually, the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial over integers for primitive nth roots of unity. But here, we're taking all 13th roots, including 1. So, the product from k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is indeed x^13 - 1.

Wait, but in our case, each product is over all 13th roots, so substituting x with (1 + i) and (1 - i). So, the first product is (1 + i)^13 - 1, and the second is (1 - i)^13 - 1. Therefore, the entire product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].

So, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, and then multiply the results. Then, take that number modulo 1000.

Alright, let me compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let's see, 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle is 45 degrees or π/4 radians.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n π/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 13 π/4}. Let me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, 13π/4 is the same as 3π + π/4, since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4. 3π is equivalent to π + 2π, so it's like adding full rotations. But let's compute it modulo 2π. 13π/4 divided by 2π is (13/4)/2 = 13/8, which is 1 and 5/8. So, the angle is equivalent to 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So, e^{i 5π/4} is equal to cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

So, putting it all together, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).

Let me compute that. sqrt(2) times sqrt(2) is 2. So, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2)/2 = 64*(-i) = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, let's compute (1 - i)^13. 1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2) as well, but its angle is -π/4.

So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) e^{-iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13π/4}.

Again, (sqrt(2))^13 is 64 * sqrt(2), same as before.

Now, the angle is -13π/4. Let's compute this modulo 2π.

-13π/4 divided by 2π is -13/(8) which is -1.625. So, adding 2π until we get a positive angle within 0 to 2π.

-13π/4 + 4π = (-13π/4 + 16π/4) = 3π/4. So, e^{-i 13π/4} = e^{-i (3π/4)} = cos(3π/4) - i sin(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, no. Wait, 3π/4 is in the second quadrant, so cos is negative, sin is positive. So, e^{-i 3π/4} is cos(3π/4) - i sin(3π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).

Wait, but wait, wait. The angle for (1 - i) is -π/4. So, (1 - i)^13 has angle -13π/4. Let me compute that angle as a positive angle by adding multiples of 2π.

-13π/4 + 4π = (-13π/4 + 16π/4) = 3π/4.

So, e^{-i 13π/4} = e^{-i (3π/4)} = cos(3π/4) - i sin(3π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).

So, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].

Compute this:

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2)/2 = 64*(-i) = -64i.

Wait, that can't be right because (1 - i)^13 should be the conjugate of (1 + i)^13. Because (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so raising to the same power should give conjugates.

Wait, earlier I found (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. So, the conjugate would be -64 +64i. Let me check my calculation again for (1 - i)^13.

Wait, when I did (1 - i)^13, I said it's 64 sqrt(2) times e^{-i 13π/4}. But e^{-i 13π/4} is same as e^{-i (3π/4 + 2π*2)} = e^{-i 3π/4} which is cos(3π/4) - i sin(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the angle. Let me compute -13π/4 modulo 2π. Let's see:

-13π/4 = -3π - π/4. Adding 4π (which is 2 full rotations) gives (-13π/4 + 4π) = (-13π/4 + 16π/4) = 3π/4. So, yes, angle is 3π/4. So, e^{-i 3π/4} is cos(3π/4) - i sin(3π/4). Which is -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

So, the calculation is correct. Then, (1 - i)^13 is 64*sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).

So, let's compute that:

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so the second term is 64*sqrt(2)*(-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-i * 2)/2 = 64*(-i) = -64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = (-64) + (-64i) = -64 -64i. Wait, no! Wait, that can't be right because (1 - i)^13 should be the conjugate of (1 + i)^13. Because 1 - i is the conjugate of 1 + i.

But (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 is -64 -64i? That would mean they are the same, but that's not possible because they should be conjugates, which would be -64 +64i for (1 - i)^13.

Hmm, so I must have messed up the angle somewhere.

Wait a second, let's re-examine the angle calculation for (1 - i)^13.

(1 - i) has angle -π/4, right? So, when raised to 13th power, the angle becomes -13π/4.

But, -13π/4 is the same as adding multiples of 2π to get it in the range [0, 2π).

So, let's compute -13π/4 + 4π = (-13π/4 + 16π/4)
