Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's try to model this. Let's define P(n) as the position where there are n tokens left. If the current player can make a move that leads the opponent into a losing position, then P(n) is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

Base cases:
- P(0): Well, if there are zero tokens, the game is over. So, if it's your turn and there are zero tokens left, you lose because you can't make a move. So P(0) is a losing position.
- P(1): The current player can take 1 token and win. So P(1) is a winning position.
- P(2): Similarly, take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then can take the last one and win. Wait, no, hold on. If you take 1 from 2, you leave 1, then the opponent takes 1 and wins. So maybe P(2) is a losing position? Wait, no, because the current player could take 1 token, but that's all they can do. So if it's your turn and n=2, you take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So P(2) is a losing position for the current player. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Grundy numbers or something. Alternatively, maybe it's better to build a table of positions and see which are winning (W) or losing (L) for the current player.

Let me start by listing n from 0 upwards and mark whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15...
W/L| L ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

Starting with n=0, which is losing (L). For n=1, the current player can take 1 and win, so W. For n=2, the player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So if n=2, the current player has no choice but to leave a W position for the opponent. So n=2 is L. Wait, that can't be right, because if n=2, the current player takes 1 and the opponent takes the last one. So the current player can't win, making n=2 a losing position.

Wait, but if n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1, which is a W position for the opponent, so the opponent can win. So n=2 is L.

Similarly, n=3: current player can take 1, leaving 2 (L), which is a losing position for the opponent. So n=3 is W.

n=4: current player can take 4, leaving 0, which is L. So n=4 is W.

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4 (W) for opponent, or take 4, leaving 1 (W). So all options leave opponent in W positions. So n=5 is L.

n=6: current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L), which is losing for opponent. So n=6 is W.

n=7: take 1, leaving 6 (W). Or take 4, leaving 3 (W). So all moves leave opponent in W. So n=7 is L.

n=8: take 1, leaving 7 (L). So opponent is in L, so n=8 is W.

n=9: take 1, leaving 8 (W). Take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if current player takes 4, opponent is in L. So n=9 is W.

Wait, no, because if current player takes 4 from 9, they leave 5, which is L. So opponent is in L, meaning current player can force a win. So n=9 is W.

Wait, let me correct that. So n=5 is L, so if the current player can move to n=5, then n=9 would be W.

Wait, so let's make a table step by step:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16...
W/L: L W L W W L W L W W  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

Wait, let me see:

n=0: L

n=1: W (take 1)

n=2: from 2, take 1→1 (W), so opponent can win. So n=2 is L.

n=3: take 1→2 (L), so opponent loses. So n=3 is W.

n=4: take 4→0 (L). So n=4 is W.

n=5: possible moves are to 4 (W) or 1 (W). So all moves leave opponent in W. So n=5 is L.

n=6: take 1→5 (L). So opponent is in L, so n=6 is W.

n=7: possible moves are to 6 (W) or 3 (W). So n=7 is L.

n=8: take 1→7 (L). So opponent is in L, so n=8 is W.

n=9: take 1→8 (W), take 4→5 (L). So since there's a move to L, n=9 is W.

n=10: take 1→9 (W), take 4→6 (W). Both moves leave opponent in W. So n=10 is L.

n=11: take 1→10 (L). So n=11 is W.

n=12: take 1→11 (W), take 4→8 (W). So n=12 is L.

n=13: take 1→12 (L). So n=13 is W.

n=14: take 1→13 (W), take 4→10 (L). So since can move to L, n=14 is W.

n=15: take 1→14 (W), take 4→11 (W). So n=15 is L.

n=16: take 1→15 (L). So n=16 is W.

Wait, let's list what we have so far:

n | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
W/L| L W L W W L W L W W L  W  L  W  W  L  W

Looking for a pattern here. Let me see:

Indices where position is L (losing): 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,...

Wait, let's see the differences between the losing positions:

0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to 7: +2

7 to 10: +3

10 to 12: +2

12 to 15: +3

So it alternates between adding 2 and 3. So the losing positions are every 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22, etc. So it's a periodic pattern?

Wait, maybe it's a cycle of length 5? Let's check.

Looking at the losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27, etc.

So, from 0, adding 2: 2, then 5 (+3), then 7 (+2), 10 (+3), 12 (+2), 15 (+3), 17 (+2), 20 (+3), 22 (+2), etc. So the pattern is +2, +3, +2, +3, etc.

So the losing positions are every 2n + something. Let me see if there's a cycle.

Wait, perhaps the losing positions follow a modulo pattern. Let me check modulo 5 or 6.

Looking at the losing positions:

0: 0 mod 5 is 0

2: 2 mod5=2

5: 0 mod5=0

7: 2 mod5=2

10:0 mod5=0

12:2 mod5=2

15:0 mod5=0

17:2 mod5=2

20:0 mod5=0

22:2 mod5=2

25:0 mod5=0

27:2 mod5=2

So, yes, the losing positions are n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, let's check:

n=0: 0 mod5=0 → L

n=2: 2 mod5=2 → L

n=5: 5 mod5=0 → L

n=7:7 mod5=2 → L

n=10:10 mod5=0 → L

n=12:12 mod5=2 → L

n=15:15 mod5=0 → L

n=17:17 mod5=2 → L

Yes, that seems to fit.

So, the losing positions are when n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, let me verify n=20: 20 mod5=0 → L.

n=22:22 mod5=2 → L.

Yes, that's consistent.

So, in general, positions where n ≡0 or 2 mod5 are losing positions.

So, if n is a losing position, then the current player cannot win if the opponent plays optimally.

But the question is about Bob being able to guarantee a win regardless of Alice's play. So, Bob can win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice, which would mean that n is a losing position, i.e., n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but wait: the starting player is Alice. So if the starting position is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) cannot win, meaning Bob can win.

So, the positions where n ≡0 or 2 mod5 are losing positions for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

So, the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5 and ≡2 mod5.

Let me compute the count.

Number of numbers ≤2024 ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5) = 404.8 → 404 numbers, since 5×404=2020, and 2025 would be 405×5, which is beyond 2024.

Wait, 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so the integer division gives 404. But wait, 5×404=2020 ≤2024, and 5×405=2025>2024. So yes, 404 numbers.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5 up to 2024.

The first number ≡2 mod5 is 2, then 7,12,... up to ≤2024.

The sequence is 5k +2 ≤2024.

So, 5k +2 ≤2024 → 5k ≤2022 → k ≤404.4. So k=0 to 404, giving 405 numbers.

Wait, because when k=404, 5×404 +2=2020+2=2022 ≤2024. Next k=405 would be 5×405+2=2027>2024.

So, for ≡2 mod5, the count is 405.

Wait, let me confirm:

For a modulus m, the number of integers ≤n congruent to r mod m is floor((n - r)/m) +1, provided r≥0 and r<m.

So, for r=0: floor(2024/5)=404.

For r=2: floor((2024-2)/5)+1= floor(2022/5)+1=404+1=405.

So, total losing positions are 404 +405=809.

Wait, so the answer is 809.

But let me double-check.

Wait, let's see for small n:

n=0: L → count 1 (but n must be positive, so 0 is excluded).

n=2: L → count 1.

n=5: L → count 2.

n=7: L → count3.

n=10: L → count4.

n=12: L→count5.

n=15: L→count6.

n=17: L→count7.

n=20: L→count8.

n=22: L→count9.

Up to n=2024.

Wait, but for n=0, it's excluded as per the problem statement which says positive integers. So do I include n=0? No, the problem says positive integers n ≤2024, so n starts at 1.

So, the losing positions for n≥1 are n≡0 mod5 and n≡2 mod5.

Wait, but when n=5: 5 mod5=0, so included.

n=2: 2 mod5=2, included.

So, the count is:

Number of n≡0 mod5 where 1 ≤n ≤2024: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5×404=2020 ≤2024, next is 2025 which is beyond).

Number of n≡2 mod5 where 1 ≤n ≤2024: The first is 2, then 7,12,... up to 2022 (since 2022=5×404 +2=2020+2=2022). So the number of terms is 404 +1=405 (since k starts at 0: 5×0+2=2, up to k=404:5×404+2=2022).

So total losing positions are 404+405=809.

So, the answer is 809.

But to be thorough, let me check for n=5: yes, it's a losing position. So, in positions where n≡0 or 2 mod5, the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position (0 or 2 mod5), then Bob can win.

So the number of such n ≤2024 is 809.


Alice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, taking turns to remove either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the player who takes the last token wins. To determine the number of positive integers $n \leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions.

A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. By examining small values of $n$, we identify that losing positions occur when $n \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ or $n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$. This pattern holds for all $n \geq 0$.

To count the number of such $n$ up to 2024:
1. **Numbers $\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$**: There are $\left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404$ such numbers.
2. **Numbers $\equiv 2 \pmod{5}$**: These start at 2 and end at 2022. The count is $\left\lfloor \frac{2024 - 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405$.

Adding these, the total number of losing positions is $404 + 405 = 809$. Thus, Bob can guarantee a win in 809 cases.

$\boxed{809}$
