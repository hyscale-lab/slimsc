Okay, so I need to figure out this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and whoever takes the last token wins. I have to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make it possible for Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think. It's a game theory problem, so I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

In this game, the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens each turn. So, the key is to find for which n Bob can ensure a win. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice. So, we need to find the losing positions for the starting player (Alice) because that means Bob can win.

Let me try to model this. Let's define a position as losing if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win. So, if a player is at a losing position, whatever they do (remove 1 or 4 tokens), the opponent can respond in a way that leads back to a losing position for the first player.

Let me try to list out the positions for small n and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice. So, Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Wait, but wait, no—wait, if n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. But the last token is taken by Bob, so Bob wins. Wait, but that can't be right because Alice is supposed to be going first. Wait no, wait. If n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So, no, that's not good. Alternatively, does Alice have another option? She can take 1 or 4. But n=2, she can't take 4. So, she takes 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So, for n=2, Alice can't win because whatever she does, Bob can take the last token. Wait, that makes n=2 a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So, n=2 is a losing position for the starting player (Alice), so Bob can win.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. She can't take 4, so she takes 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So, yes, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. From n=2, Bob is in a losing position because if he takes 1, Alice can take the remaining 1 and win. Wait, no, earlier I
