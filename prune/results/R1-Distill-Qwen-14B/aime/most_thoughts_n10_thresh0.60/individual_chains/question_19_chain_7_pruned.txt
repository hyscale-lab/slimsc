Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. It also says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to recall some properties related to circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius R is 13, so that's the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

I remember that the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. Also, in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me check. Yes, I think that's correct. So OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Plugging in the numbers: R is 13 and r is 6. So OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). That's useful.

But wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So IA ⊥ OI. Hmm. That must mean that triangle OIA is a right triangle with the right angle at A? Wait no, IA is perpendicular to OI, so it's at point I? No, wait, IA is the segment from I to A, and OI is the segment from O to I. So if IA is perpendicular to OI, then in the triangle OIA, the angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle OIA is right-angled at I.

Wait, so in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = OI² + IA². But OA is the distance from O to A, which is the circumradius, so OA is 13. So 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA². That would be 169 = 13 + IA², so IA² =
