Okay, so I have this problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that every morning Aya walks 9 kilometers. She usually walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, and this walk takes her 4 hours, but this time includes 't' minutes she spends in the coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, her walking time decreases to 2 hours and 24 minutes, with the same 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. 

The question is, if she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how many minutes will her walk take, including the 't' minutes at the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the total time, including coffee shop time, when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h. But first, I think I need to find the values of 's' and 't' from the given information.

Wait, so when she walks at speed 's', the total time taken is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus the coffee shop time 't' minutes. Similarly, when she walks faster at 's + 2', the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes 't' minutes.

But wait, the total time given is including the coffee shop time. So, the actual walking time would be the total time minus 't' minutes. Hmm, that makes sense.

So, let's denote:

- When speed is s km/h:
  - Total time = 4 hours = 4*60 = 240 minutes.
  - So, walking time = 240 - t minutes.

- When speed is (s + 2) km/h:
  - Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2*(60) + 24 = 144 minutes.
  - So, walking time = 144 - t minutes.

But wait, walking time can also be calculated as distance divided by speed. Since the distance is 9 km, the walking time should be 9/s hours when she walks at speed 's', and 9/(s+2) hours when she walks faster.

Wait, but in the first case, the total time is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes of coffee. So
