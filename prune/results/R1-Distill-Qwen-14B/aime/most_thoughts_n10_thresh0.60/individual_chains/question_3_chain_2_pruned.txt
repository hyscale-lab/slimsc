Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two numbers matching, A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A).

So, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize, and B is the event of winning any prize (at least two numbers matching).

First, let me figure out P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. 

In this lottery, 4 numbers are drawn from 10. The number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10,4). Jen has picked one specific set of 4 numbers. So, the probability that the randomly chosen 4 numbers match her exact 4 numbers is 1 / C(10,4). 

C(10,4) is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen 4. 

Calculating P(B) can be done using the principle of inclusion, but maybe it's easier to calculate the probability of not winning a prize and subtracting from 1. 

Not winning a prize means that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, which is zero or one number. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

First, let's compute P(zero matches). This is the probability that none of Jen's 4 numbers are chosen. So, the 4 numbers are all from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10-4=6). 

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4) = 15. So, the probability is 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Next, P(one match). This is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the other three are from the remaining 6. 

The number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 is C(4,1) = 4. The number of ways to choose the remaining 3 numbers from the other 6 is C(6,3) = 20. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 4 * 20 = 80. 

So, the probability is 80 / 210. Let me simplify that: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 10, so that's 8/21.

Therefore, P(zero matches) = 1/14, P(one match) = 8/21.

Now, let me compute these as fractions with a common denominator to sum them up. The denominators are 14 and 21; the least common multiple is 42.

Convert 1/14 to 3/42 and 8/21 to 16/42. So, adding them together: 3/42 + 16/42 = 19/42.

So, the total probability of not winning a prize is 19/42. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize, P(B), is 1 - 19/42 = 23/42.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation because 19/42 is the sum of 3/42 (1/14) and 16/42 (8/21). So, 19/42 subtracted from 1 is (42/42 - 19/42) = 23/42. That seems correct.

So, P(B) = 23/42.

Earlier, we had P(A) = 1/210.

Wait, but hold on. Since P(A) is the probability of winning the grand prize, which is a subset of winning a prize, so in the conditional probability, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that. So,  (1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). Simplify 42/210: that's 1/5. So, 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that would make the probability 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115, which are coprime. So, m + n is 116.

But wait, let me think again because that might not be accurate. Because in the way we've set up P(B), which is the probability of at least two matches, is it correct?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating P(B). Because in the problem statement, winning a prize is defined as at least two of her numbers being among the chosen four. So, B is the event that she has at least two matches. So,
