Okay, so I've got this problem here. I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and another equation involving their squares and products, which is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down.

First, let me write down what I know. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation is more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. I wonder if there's a way to simplify the second equation.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. So, for example, a²b, a²c, etc. Maybe I can factor this somehow. Let me try to group terms.

Wait, perhaps I can factor it as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Let's check that:

a²(b + c) would be a²b + a²c,
b²(a + c) would be b²a + b²c,
c²(a + b) would be c²a + c²b.

Yes, that works. So the second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of 300 - a, 300 - b, and 300 - c respectively.

Let me substitute:

(b + c) = 300 - a,
(a + c) = 300 - b,
(a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable. Let me expand each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³,
b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³,
c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³.

So the entire equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 300 to simplify:

a² + b² + c² - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps much. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)². I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, since a + b + c = 300, that gives:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc),
90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc),
so a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Hmm, maybe that substitution can help.

Looking back at the equation we had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting a² + b² + c²:

300(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Calculating 300 * 90,000: 300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

So:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange this:

-600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000,
-600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000.

Multiplying both sides by -1:

600(ab + ac + bc) + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Now, I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe there's another identity that relates a³ + b³ + c³ to other terms.

I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Let me write that down:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

We know a + b + c = 300, so let me compute each part:

(a + b + c)^3 = 300³ = 27,000,000.

3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) = 3 * 300 * (ab + ac + bc) = 900(ab + ac + bc).

So substituting back:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Now, let's substitute this into our earlier equation:

600(ab + ac + bc) + [27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 21,000,000.

Now, let's simplify:

600(ab + ac + bc) + 27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc = 21,000,000.

Combine like terms:

[600 - 900](ab + ac + bc) + 27,000,000 + 3abc = 21,000,000,
-300(ab + ac + bc) + 27,000,000 + 3abc = 21,000,000.

Let's move the 27,000,000 to the other side:

-300(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc = 21,000,000 - 27,000,000,
-300(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc = -6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

-100(ab + ac + bc) + abc = -2,000,000.

Let me rearrange that:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, that's an interesting equation. Maybe factor out some terms.

Let me factor out ab, ac, and bc:

ab(c - 100) + ac(-100) + bc(-100) = -2,000,000.

Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out (ab + ac + bc):

Wait, maybe let's see:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

I can factor out (ab + ac + bc) as follows, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps adding 100^3 to both sides? Wait, let me think.

Wait, another approach: since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, maybe we can think of substitutions.

Let me denote x = a, y = b, z = c.

So, our equations are:

x + y + z = 300,

and

xyz - 100(xy + xz + y
