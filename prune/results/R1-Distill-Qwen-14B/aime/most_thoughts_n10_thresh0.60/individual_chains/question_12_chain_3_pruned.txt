Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that when you read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999, and when you read them top to bottom, their sum is 99. The example given is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

Which works because 0 + 991 = 991, and 0 + 9 + 81 = 90, wait, that doesn't add up to 99. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991, which is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999, right. Then, reading top to bottom, the first column is 0 and 9, which makes 09, which is 9. The second column is 0 and 9, making 09, which is 9. The third column is 8 and 1, making 81. So 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Oh, okay, I see. So the way the columns are read as two-digit numbers. Got it.

So, the problem is to find how many such grids exist.

Let me try to model this.

First, let me denote the grid cells as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the top row is abc, which is a three-digit number: 100a + 10b + c.

Similarly, the bottom row is def: 100d + 10e + f.

The sum of the top and bottom numbers is 999, so:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Simplify this equation: 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

But 999 is 9*100 + 9*10 + 9, so:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Which implies:

a + d = 9

b + e = 9

c + f = 9

Because each of the coefficients (100, 10, 1) must add up to 9 in each place for 999.

So that's one condition.

Now, the other condition is that the sum of the numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

Each column is treated as a two-digit number. So, the first column is ad, which is 10a + d.

Second column is be, which is 10b + e.

Third column is cf, which is 10c + f.

So the sum is:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me write that out:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Factor this:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, interesting. So, from the first condition, we have a + d = 9, b + e =9, c + f=9. So, d =9 - a, e=9 - b, f=9 -c.

Let me substitute d, e, f into the second equation.

So, 10(a + b + c) + ( (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) ) = 99.

Simplify inside the parentheses:

(9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - (a + b + c).

So the equation becomes:

10(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) = 99.

Let me denote S = a + b + c. Then the equation is:

10S + (27 - S) = 99.

Simplify:

10S + 27 - S = 99.

Which is 9S + 27 = 99.

Subtract 27 from both sides:

9S = 72.

Divide both sides by 9:

S = 8.

So, S = a + b + c = 8.

So, now, we have the following constraints:

1. a + d = 9

2. b + e = 9

3. c + f = 9

4. a + b + c = 8.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions for a, b, c, d, e, f, with each variable being a digit (0-9), such that the above four conditions are satisfied.

Wait, but each cell is a single digit (0-9). So a, b, c, d, e, f are each digits between 0 and 9 inclusive.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since a, b, c are digits, each can be 0-9. But their sum is 8, so each can be between 0 and 8, because if any one were 9, the sum would exceed 8. So a, b, c can be 0-8, and d, e, f are determined by d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c.

But we also need to ensure that d, e, f are digits (0-9). Since a, b, c are 0-8, d, e, f would be 9- a, 9 - b, 9 - c, which would be 1-9, 1-9, 1-9. So d, e, f are 1-9, which is fine because digits can be 0-9, but 9 - 0=9, which is allowed.

Wait, actually, if a is 0, then d=9, which is allowed. Similarly, if a=8, d=1.

So, all the constraints on d, e, f are satisfied as long as a, b, c are <=8.

So, the problem now is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions for a + b + c =8, with each of a, b, c <=8 (since 8 is less than 9, and a, b, c can't be more than 8, so the upper limit is automatically satisfied as the sum is 8).

Wait, but since a, b, c are digits (0-9), and their sum is 8, which is less than 27, the upper limit for any of them is 8. So, the constraints are just a + b + c =8, with a, b, c >=0, and each <=8.

So, the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8 is C(8 + 3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

Wait, but in this case, the upper limit of 8 for each variable is not restrictive because if a + b + c =8 and each is non-negative, then each must be <=8. So, the number of solutions is indeed 45.

But wait, each of a, b, c is a digit, so each can be 0-9, but in this case, since their total is 8, each can be 0-8. So, yeah, 45 solutions.

But wait, perhaps I should think about each variable as digits, and the sum is 8, so the number of non-negative integer solutions is 45, but each of a, b, c could be up to 8, but since the sum is 8, the maximum any single variable can take is 8. So, no variable exceeds 8, so all solutions are valid.

But wait, is that correct? For example, if a, b, c are digits, they can be 0-9, but in our case, since their sum is 8, each can be at most 8, so all the possible solutions are valid.

So, the number of possible triples (a, b, c) is 45.

But wait, let me verify that.

Yes, the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8 is C(8+3-1,3-1)=C(10,2)=45. So, 45 possible triples.

Each of these triples will determine d, e, f as
