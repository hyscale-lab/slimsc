Okay, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. This probability is expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), right? In this case, event A is her winning the grand prize, and event B is her winning a prize. So, since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two correct numbers, A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

So I need to find P(A), the probability she wins the grand prize, and P(B), the probability she wins any prize (at least two correct numbers).

Let me think about how to compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). So the total possible lottery draws are C(10,4).

For P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize: she needs all four of her numbers to be chosen. Since Jen picks 4 specific numbers, there's only one favorable outcome—the lottery draw matches her numbers exactly. So the number of favorable outcomes is 1, so P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So this includes the cases where exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute 1 - P(no prize), which is 1 - P(less than 2 correct numbers). So P(B) = 1 - [P(exactly 0 correct) + P(exactly 1 correct)].

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it directly. Let's see.

The number of ways to have exactly k correct numbers is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k), where C(4,k) is the number of ways to choose k correct numbers from Jen's 4, and C(6,4 - k) is the number of ways to choose the remaining 4 - k numbers from the other 6 numbers not chosen by Jen. Wait, is that right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total number of possible lottery draws is C(10,4). The number of ways for exactly k of Jen's numbers to be in the draw is C(4,k) * C(6, 4 - k), because we choose k correct numbers from her 4, and the remaining 4 - k numbers from the 6 numbers she didn't pick.

Yes, that makes sense. So for k=2, it's C(4,2)*C(6,2). For k=3, it's C(4,3)*C(6,1). For k=4, it's C(4,4)*C(6,0). So the total number of favorable outcomes for event B is the sum of these for k=2,3,4.

Alternatively, the total number is [C(4,2)C(6,2) + C(4,3)C(6,1) + C(4,4)C(6,0)].

So P(B) is [C(4,2)C(6,2) + C(4,
