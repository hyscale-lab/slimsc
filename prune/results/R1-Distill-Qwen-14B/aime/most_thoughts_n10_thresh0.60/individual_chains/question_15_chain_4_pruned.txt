Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, starting from the lower left corner and ending at the upper right corner. The catch is that these paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First off, I remember that in grid paths, usually, you're moving either right or up. On an 8x8 grid, to go from the bottom left to the top right, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a permutation of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But here, the problem is more specific: we need paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, so what does it mean to change direction? On a grid, each time you switch from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So for example, a path that goes all the way right and then all the way up has only one direction change. Similarly, a path that alternates right and up as much as possible will have more direction changes.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that translate into the structure of the path? Let me think. Each direction change splits the path into segments. For example, if you have four direction changes, how many segments does that create?

Well, each change alternates the direction, so starting from the first direction, each change adds a new segment. So, starting with right, then changing to up, then back to right, and so on. The number of segments would be one more than the number of direction changes. So four changes would result in five segments. Wait, is that right? Let me check with a smaller number: zero changes would mean just one segment. One change would split the path into two segments. So, yes, four changes would make five segments.

So, for our problem, each path with four direction changes has five segments. Now, in each segment, the path is moving either right or up. Since the path starts at the lower left corner and ends at the upper right, the first segment must be right (R) and the last must be up (U), right? Because we start at the bottom, so the first move is to the right, and the last move must be upwards to reach the top.

Wait, but actually, could the first segment be up? No, because starting at the lower left, the first step can only be right or up, but to reach the upper right, we have to make both 8 right and 8 up moves. So the path must begin with right or up, but if it starts with up, the next segment would have to be right, and so on. So actually, the starting direction could be either right or up. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.

Wait, but in the case of an 8x8 grid, the starting point is (0,0), and the endpoint is (8,8). So, each path must have exactly 8 rights and 8 ups. So, the first move could be R or U, but the entire path must have 8 of each.

But in terms of direction changes, it's about how many times the direction switches from R to U or U to R. So, for four direction changes, regardless of the starting direction, the path alternates four times.

But perhaps it's better to model the path as a series of runs, where each run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, if a path changes direction four times, it consists of five runs. Each run alternates between R and U, starting with either R or U.

Wait, but whether the first run is R or U affects the total number of runs. So, perhaps I should consider two cases: paths that start with R and paths that start with U. Let me see.

Case 1: The first run is R. Then the sequence of runs would be R, U, R, U,
