Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the functions f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both are absolute value functions with some modifications. Let me write them out more clearly.

f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |  
g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |

Alright, these look like transformations of the absolute value function. Let me try to graph them mentally. For f(x), the inner part is |x| which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so it becomes |x| - 1/2. This would shift the graph down by 1/2, but since it's inside another absolute value, f(x) would take the absolute value of that result. So, when |x| - 1/2 is negative, the outer absolute value will flip it.

Similarly, g(x) is the same idea but subtracting 1/4. Let me see if I can sketch their graphs.

For f(x):
- When |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.
- When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So f(x) is a V-shaped graph that starts at (0, 0). Wait, no, actually, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. Then as |x| increases, it decreases until |x| = 1/2, where f(x) = 0, and then increases again. So the graph of f(x) is a V with the vertex at (0, 1/2), then it goes down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), and then up again.

Similarly for g(x):
- When |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.
- When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So g(x) is similar but starts at (0, 1/4), goes down to (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0), then up again.

Now, the functions in the problem involve compositions of f and g with sin and cos functions, then scaled by 4.

Let me look at the first function: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

Let me parse this. Start with sin(2πx), apply f to it, then apply g, then multiply by 4.

Similarly, the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

So, to find the intersections, I need to find pairs (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied. That is, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So each equation is a function mapping x to y, and y to x, respectively.

This seems like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the other. To find intersections, I can think of plugging one into the other, but it's a bit tangled because both x and y are expressed in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of this as a parametric system where each x is determined by y, and each y is determined by x. So, maybe I can set up an equation where both expressions are set equal to each other in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can analyze the functions f and g in more detail to understand how they transform the sine and cosine functions, then see how the compositions affect the overall graph.

Let me first analyze the inner functions.

Starting with f(sin(2πx)):

f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Hmm, so that's the absolute value of |sin(2πx)| minus 1/2. Let's see what that looks like.

The inner part is |sin(2πx)|, which is a sine wave that's always non-negative, oscillating between 0 and 1, with a period of 1/(2π) * 2π = 1. So, the period is 1. So every integer x, it completes a cycle.

Then, subtracting 1/2, so |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. This would be a wave that goes up to 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 and down to 0 - 1/2 = -1/2. But then, taking the absolute value of that: f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

So this is the absolute value of |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. So when |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, the expression inside is non-negative, so f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, it's 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So f(sin(2πx)) is a waveform that oscillates between 0 and 1/2. Because when |sin(2πx)| is 1, f is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 0, f is 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 1/2, f is 0. So the graph is a V shape in each period, peaking at 0 and 1/2 and reaching 1/2 at the extremes.

Wait, let me think again. So for each x, sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1. Then taking absolute value, it's between 0 and 1. Then subtracting 1/2: so when |sin(2πx)| is 1, 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 0, 0 - 1/2 = -1/2. Then taking absolute value, so the minimum is 0 (when |sin(2πx)| is 1/2), and maximum is 1/
