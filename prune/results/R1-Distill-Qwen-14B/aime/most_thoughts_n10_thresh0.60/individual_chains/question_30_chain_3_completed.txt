Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.

Alright, so ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because it's a 13th root and not equal to 1. So, that means ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial it satisfies is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. I remember that cyclotomic polynomials are factors of x^n - 1, and for prime n like 13, the cyclotomic polynomial is x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

The product given is over all k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that down:

Product = Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm. Maybe I can factor each term or find a pattern. Let's see what each term looks like.

Looking at 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}, I wonder if this can be rewritten in a more manageable form. Let me consider substituting x = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, the product becomes Π_{x=ω^k} (x^2 - 2x + 2). Since k ranges from 0 to 12, x will take on all the 13th roots of unity except 1, because when k=0, x=ω^0=1, but wait, no, k=0 gives x=1, but ω is not equal to 1, so wait, in the problem statement, ω ≠ 1 is a 13th root of unity, but the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0 where x=1. Hmm, so one of the terms is when x=1, so let's compute that first.

When x=1, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So the product is the same as the product over x being all 13th roots of unity except x=1, of (x^2 - 2x + 2). Because when x=1, the term is 1, so the product is just the product over x ≠1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).

So, the product becomes Π_{x ≠1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all roots x of (z - x) is the cyclotomic polynomial. But here, we have a product over x ≠1 of a quadratic in x. So perhaps I can relate this to some polynomial evaluated at certain points.

Let me consider the polynomial f(z) = z^13 - 1, which factors as (z - 1)(z^{12} + z^{11} + ... + z + 1). The roots of f(z) are all the 13th roots of unity, so x^13 = 1.

Wait, but I'm dealing with the product over x ≠1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, if I can express this product as a value of some polynomial evaluated at a certain point, that might help.

I recall that the product over (z - x) for x being roots of a polynomial P is equal to P(z). So, if I can find a polynomial whose roots are the x's, then evaluating that polynomial at z would give me the product.

But in this case, the terms are quadratic in x. Maybe I can consider the product Π_{x ≠1} (x^2 - 2x + 2) as Π_{x ≠1} (x^2 - 2x + 2) = Π_{x ≠1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider evaluating f(z) at specific points. Wait, another approach: Since x ≠1 are the roots of z^{12} + z^{11} + ... + z + 1 = 0, maybe I can use that.

So, let me denote P(z) = z^{12} + z^{11} + ... + z + 1. Then the roots of P(z) are x = ω^k for k=1 to 12. So, the product I'm seeking is Π_{x root of P} (x^2 - 2x + 2).

I think that relates to evaluating another polynomial at specific points. Let me think about the product over roots of P(z) of (x - a) is equal to P(a). But here, the terms are quadratic, so I need a way to express the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) as something.

Alternatively, maybe I can write (x^2 - 2x + 2) as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), since the roots are 1 ± i. So, (x^2 - 2x + 2) factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, the product Π_{x root of P} (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to Π_{x root of P} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Which is the same as [Π_{x root of P} (x - (1 + i))] * [Π_{x root of P} (x - (1 - i))].

But each of those products is P evaluated at (1 + i) and (1 - i), because if P(z) = Π_{x root of P} (z - x), then Π_{x root of P} (x - a) = Π_{x root of P} (a - x) = P(a) if we reverse the order of multiplication, which introduces a sign. Wait, no, more carefully:

Π_{x} (x - a) = (-1)^{deg P} Π_{x} (a - x) = (-1)^{12} P(a) = P(a), since 12 is even.

So, Π_{x} (x - a) = P(a). Therefore, our product is P(1 + i) * P(1 - i).

So, now I need to compute P(1 + i) and P(1 - i) where P(z) = z^{12} + z^{11} + ... + z + 1.

So, let me write down P(z) = (z^{13} - 1)/(z - 1), since z^13 - 1 = (z - 1)P(z). That might be helpful, because perhaps evaluating at z = 1 + i and z = 1 - i could be manageable.

So, P(z) = (z^{13} - 1)/(z - 1). Therefore, P(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/(i).

Similarly, P(1 - i) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i).

So, then, the product is P(1 + i) * P(1 - i) = [ ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/i ] * [ ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i) ].

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form: |1 + i| = sqrt(2), angle is π/4. So, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^{13}.

sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) e^{i * 13π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Now, let's compute e^{i * 13π/4}.

13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to π/4 (since angles are modulo 2π). Wait, 13π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8, which is 1 + 5/8, so the angle is 13π/4 - 2π*1 = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, for negative angle: e^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{-i*(5π/4)}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) e^{i*5π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i*5π/4}.

Now, e^{i*5π/4} is cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-√2/2 - i√2/2).

Similarly, e^{-i*5π/4} is cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-√2/2 + i√2/2).

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-√2/2 - i√2/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-√2/2)(1 + i).

Compute that: sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1. So, 64 * (-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-√2/2 + i√2/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-√2/2)(1 - i).

Again, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1. So, 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).

So, now, let's go back to P(1 + i) and P(1 - i).

P(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / i = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] / i = [ -64 -64i -1 ] / i = [ -65 -64i ] / i.

Similarly, P(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / (-i) = [ -64(1 - i) -1 ] / (-i) = [ -64 +64i -1 ] / (-i) = [ -65 +64i ] / (-i).

So, now compute each of these.

First, compute P(1 + i) = [ -65 -64i ] / i.

To divide by i, multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

( (-65 -64i)(-i) ) / (i*(-i)) ) = (65i +64i^2) / (1) since i*(-i)=1.

Which is 65i +64*(-1) = 65i -64.

Similarly, P(1 - i) = [ -65 +64i ] / (-i).

Again, multiply numerator and denominator by i:

( (-65 +64i)i ) / (-i * i ) = ( -65i +64i^2 ) / (1 ) = (-65i -64).

So, P(1 + i) = -64 +65i, and P(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

So, now, the product P(1 + i) * P(1 - i) = (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i).

This is of the form (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², where a = -64 and b = 65i.

Wait, no, actually, a = -64 and b = 65i, so the product is a² - (b)^2.

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly. Let me expand it:

(-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 + (terms with i). Wait, no, actually, it's a product of the form (c + d)(c - d) = c² - d². Because if c = -64, and d = 65i, then yes.

So, c² = (-64)^2 = 4096, and d² = (65i)^2 = 4225 i² = -4225. So, the product is 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Wait, that seems off. Let me compute it step by step.

(-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (-64)*(-65i) + (65i)*(-64) + (65i)*(-65i)

= 4096 + 4160i - 4160i - 4225i²

Simplify term by term:

4096 + (4160i - 4160i) + (-4225i²)

The middle terms cancel out, so we have 4096 + (-4225)(-1) because i² = -1.

So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct. So, the product is 8321.

But wait, earlier I thought the product was P(1+i)*P(1-i) = 8321, so that's the product over all x≠1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). But our initial product included k=0, but that term was 1, so the product is indeed 8321.

But wait, the problem says to compute the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), which includes k=0, but when k=0, ω^0=1, and (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = 1. So, the overall product is 1 * (product from x≠1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2)) = 8321.

Wait, but 8321 is the value of the product, right? So, the product is 8321.

But wait, 8321 is a big number, and the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321, since 8000 is divisible by 1000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 8321 seems a bit large, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, let me go back through the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, we expressed the product as P(1+i)*P(1-i), which is correct because each term is (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)) for x being the roots of P(z).

Then, evaluating P(1+i) and P(1-i):

We had P(z) = (z^{13} -1)/(z -1).

So, for z =1 + i, P(1+i) = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) / (i). Similarly for z=1 -i.

We computed (1+i)^13 as -64(1 + i), and (1 -i)^13 as -64(1 -i). That seems correct because when you raise (sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}) to the 13th power, you multiply the angle by 13, which is 13*π/4 = 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to 5π/4 modulo 2π. So, e^{i5π/4} is (-√2/2 - i√2/2), and when multiplied by (sqrt(2))^13 = 64*sqrt(2), we get 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64. So, (1+i)^13 = -64(1 + i), correct.

Then, P(1+i) = [ -64(1+i) -1 ] / i = (-65 -64i)/i.

Dividing by i: multiply numerator and denominator by -i: (-65 -64i)(-i) = 65i +64i^2 = 65i -64.

Similarly, P(1 -i) = [ -64(1 -i) -1 ] / (-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65i +64i^2) = -65i -64.

So, P(1+i) = -64 +65i, P(1 -i) = -64 -65i.

Then, the product is (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225*(-1)) = 4096 +4225= 8321.

So, that seems correct. So, the product is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321, since 8321 = 8*1000 + 321.

Wait, but let me compute 8321 divided by 1000. 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321, so yes, 321 is the remainder.

So, the answer should be 321.

Wait, but to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in any step, perhaps I should verify each computation again.

Let me check the evaluation of (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13:

1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2), angle π/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*13*(π/4)}.

(sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

13*(π/4) = (3π + π/4) = π/4 + 3π. Since angles are periodic mod 2π, 3π is equivalent to π mod 2π, so 13π/4 is equivalent to 13π/4 - 2π * 1 = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

So, e^{i*5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2).

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i*sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i) ] = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i). Correct.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i*5π/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2 + i*sqrt(2)/2) ] = -64(1 - i). Correct.

Then, P(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / (i) = [ -64(1 + i) -1 ] / i = (-64 -64i -1)/i = (-65 -64i)/i.

Divide by i: multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

(-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i +64i^2) / 1 = 65i -64. Correct.

Similarly, P(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / (-i) = [ -64(1 - i) -1 ] / (-i) = (-64 +64i -1)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

(-65 +64i)(i) / (-i * i) = (-65i +64i^2) / 1 = (-65i -64). Correct.

So, the product is (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225*(-1)) = 4096 +4225=8321. Correct.

So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but just to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the product expression.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using logarithms or other properties. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to compute the product.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the product over (x - a) for x being the roots of P(z) is P(a). So, as I did before, that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the product over all x (including x=1) would be P(1 + i)*P(1 - i) times the term at x=1, but wait, no, because when x=1, the term x^2 - 2x + 2 is 1, so it's already included as 1, so the product is indeed 8321.

I think I can be confident in my calculation, so the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.


Alright, now let's break it down step by step.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

We need to find the remainder when the product 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \]
is divided by 1000, where ω is a primitive 13th root of unity (ω ≠ 1).

1. **Understanding ω:**
   - ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, so ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.

2. **Simplify Each Term:**
   - Let x = ω^k. Each term becomes (2 - 2x + x²).

3. **Product Expression:**
   - The product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2), where x runs over all 13th roots of unity, including x = 1.

4. **Excluding x = 1:**
   - When x = 1, the term is 1, so the product is unaffected. Thus, we consider Π_{x ≠1} (x² - 2x + 2).

5. **Factor the Quadratic:**
   - x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

6. **Express the Product:**
   - The product becomes [Π_{x ≠1} (x - (1 + i))] * [Π_{x ≠1} (x - (1 - i))].

7. **Using Cyclotomic Polynomial:**
   - The product Π_{x ≠1} (x - a) for a root a is equal to P(a), where P(z) = z¹² + z¹¹ + ... + z + 1.

8. **Evaluate P(1 + i) and P(1 - i):**
   - P(z) = (z¹³ - 1)/(z - 1).
   - Compute (1 + i)¹³ and (1 - i)¹³ using polar form:
     - (1 + i)¹³ = -64(1 + i), (1 - i)¹³ = -64(1 - i).

9. **Compute P(1 + i) and P(1 - i):**
   - P(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i = -64 +65i.
   - P(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -64 -65i.

10. **Multiply the Results:**
    - (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)² - (65i)² = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

11. **Find Remainder Mod 1000:**
    - 8321 mod 1000 = 321.

**Answer:** The remainder is \boxed{321}.
