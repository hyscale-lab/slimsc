Okay, I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are a bit complicated, but let's break them down step by step.

First, let's understand the functions involved. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. Then, the two graphs given are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many points these two graphs intersect.

Hmm, okay. So, both equations involve compositions of these f and g functions applied to sine and cosine functions. Let me try to figure out what these functions look like.

Let's start with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape graph. Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down, but since we take the absolute value again, it becomes V-shaped again. So, f(x) is a V-shape that's symmetric around x=0, peaking at x=0 with a value of 1/2, and then decreasing with slopes of -1 and +1 on either side. So, the graph of f(x) will have its minimum at x=0, y=1/2, and it will form a V with its sides going up as |x| increases.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's think about this. The inner |x| is the same V-shape. Subtract 1/4, then take absolute value again. So, g(x) is also a V-shape. Its vertex is at x=0, where g(0) = 1/4. It will decrease with slope -1 for x < 0 and slope +1 for x > 0 until it reaches zero at x = ±1/4, and then it will start increasing again beyond x = ±1/4.

So, both f and g are V-shaped functions with their vertices at the origin but different scales. f has a peak at 1/2 and g has a peak at 1/4. Now, let's consider the composition f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(sin(2πx))).

Wait, so first, f is applied to sin(2πx). Let's think about sin(2πx). The function sin(2πx) has a period of 1, because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so 2π/(2π) = 1. So, it's a sine wave that goes from 0 to 2π over an interval of 1. It completes a full cycle every 1 unit along the x-axis.

So, sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 1. Now, when we apply f to sin(2πx), we're taking f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let me analyze this function.

The inner |sin(2πx)| is a sine wave that's always non-negative, oscillating between 0 and 1. Then, subtracting 1/2, so we have |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. Then taking the absolute value again: ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Let me think about the range of |sin(2πx)|. It's between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 would range from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that would make it range from 0 to 1/2. So, f(sin(2πx)) is a function that ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, let me see. When |sin(2πx)| is greater than or equal to 1/2, ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| would be |sin(2πx)| - 1/2, which is non-negative. When |sin(2πx)| is less than 1/2, then ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| becomes (1/2 - |sin(2πx)|). So, f(sin(2πx)) is a function that is 1/2 - |sin(2πx)| when |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, and |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 when |sin(2πx)| ≥ 1/2.

So, f(sin(2πx)) is a waveform that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with a period of 1. Because sin(2πx) has a period of 1, so f(sin(2πx)) will also have a period of 1.

Similarly, let's consider g(f(sin(2πx))). Since f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2, and g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|. Let's plug in the range of f into g.

So, g(y) where y is between 0 and 1/2. Let's compute g(y) for 0 ≤ y ≤ 1/2.

g(y) = ||y| - 1/4|. Since y is non-negative, this simplifies to |y - 1/4|.

So, for y between 0 and 1/4, g(y) = 1/4 - y, and for y between 1/4 and 1/2, g(y) = y - 1/4.

Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) would be:

- For f(sin(2πx)) ≤ 1/4: 1/4 - f(sin(2πx))
- For f(sin(2πx)) ≥ 1/4: f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4

Since f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2, g(f(sin(2πx))) ranges from 0 (when f is 1/4) up to 1/4 (when f is 0 or 1/2). Hmm, let me check:

At f=0: g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4.

At f=1/4: g(1/4) = 0.

At f=1/2: g(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4.

So, g(f(...)) oscillates between 0 and 1/4. Then, 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) would be 4 times that, so it oscillates between 0 and 1.

So, the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that ranges between 0 and 1, with a period of 1. It's a combination of absolute values applied to sine waves, so it'll have a more complicated shape, but it's periodic.

Similarly, the other equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's analyze this. So, cos(3πy) is similar but with a different frequency. The function cos(3πy) has a period of 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So, it completes a cycle every 2/3 units. It oscillates between -1 and 1.

Then, f(cos(3πy)) is ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. Similar to earlier, this will be 1/2 - |cos(3πy)| when |cos(3πy)| < 1/2, and |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 when |cos(3πy)| ≥ 1/2.

So, f(cos(3πy)) ranges from 0 to 1/2, just like f(sin(...)).

Then, g(f(cos(3πy))) is similar to the other one. Since f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, g(f(...)) will be ||f(...) - 1/4|. So, for values of f between 0 and 1/2, g(f(...)) is |f(...) - 1/4|, which as we saw before, ranges between 0 and 1/4.

Thus, 4g(f(cos(3πy))) ranges between 0 and 1 as well.

So, the equation x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is a function where x is expressed in terms of y. It's also periodic, but with a period related to 2/3, perhaps, or maybe a different period due to the composition.

Wait, actually, let's think about it. The inner function is cos(3πy), which has a period of 2/3. But then, f(cos(3πy)) is applied, which may alter the period? Or is it still 2/3?

Wait, not necessarily. Because f is a non-linear function, the composition might change the periodicity. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the overall composition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of graphing these functions or
