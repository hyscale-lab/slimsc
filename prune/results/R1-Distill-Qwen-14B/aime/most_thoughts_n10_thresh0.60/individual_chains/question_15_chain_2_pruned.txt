Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. Hmm, wait, an 8x8 grid has 9 points along each side, right? Because 8 squares mean 9 lines. So, the grid is 8x8 squares, but the path goes from (0,0) to (8,8), which is 8 steps right and 8 steps up. So the total number of steps is 16, which makes sense because each step is either right or up.

Now, the problem says the paths change direction exactly four times. So, normally, a path on this grid without any restrictions would be a combination of right and up moves. The total number of such paths is C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have a restriction: exactly four direction changes.

Hmm, wait. What does it mean to change direction exactly four times? I think each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, if a path alternates between right and up steps, each segment between direction changes is a straight line.

So, for example, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, etc., each time it changes from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many segments does it have? Well, each direction change adds a new segment. Starting with the first segment, each direction change adds one more segment. So, four direction changes would mean five segments in total.

Right, so the path is composed of five segments. Each segment is either a series of right steps or a series of up steps. Now, since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), the number of right steps is 8, and the number of up steps is 8.

These steps are divided into five segments. Now, each segment can be either a right segment or an up segment. Also, the direction alternates between segments, but the starting direction could be either right or up.

Wait, actually, no. The starting direction can be either right or up, and then it alternates each time. So, for four direction changes, the number of segments is five. So, the path alternates direction each segment. So, if it starts with right, the directions would be right, up, right, up, right. Alternatively, if it starts with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up.

But wait, the number of segments is five, so starting with right will have three right segments and two up segments because 5 is odd. Similarly, starting with up will have three up segments and two right segments.

But wait, the total number of right steps must be 8 and the total up steps must be 8. So, let's think about that.

Case 1: Starting with right.
Segments: R, U, R, U, R.
So, three R segments and two U segments.
The sum of all R segment lengths is 8, and the sum of all U segment lengths is 8.

Each R segment must have at least 1 step, same for each U segment. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to write 8 as the sum of three positive integers (for R segments) and 8 as the sum of two positive integers (for U segments).

Similarly, Case 2: Starting with up.
Segments: U, R, U, R, U.
So, three U segments and two R segments.
Again, the sum of U segments is 8, each at least 1, and sum of R segments is 8, each at least 1.

So, the total number of paths would be the number of ways for Case 1 plus the number of ways for Case 2.

Let me compute each case separately.

First, for Case 1: Starting with right.

We have three R segments, each at least 1, adding up to 8. This is a stars and bars problem.

The number of ways to write 8 as the sum of three positive integers is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, for the two U segments, each at least 1, adding up to 8: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7.

So, the number of ways for Case 1 is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for Case 2: Starting with up.

Three U segments: number of ways is C(7,2)=21.

Two R segments: number of ways is 7.

So, the number of ways for Case 2 is 21 *7=147.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, is that correct? Hmm, but wait, could the starting direction be either right or up, but perhaps we have to consider that the number of direction changes is exactly four, regardless of starting direction.

But in both cases, the number of direction changes is four because each time the direction is alternated, so in five segments, four changes.

Wait, so yes, both cases contribute equally, and each gives 147, so total is 294.

So, is 294 the answer? Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, another way to model this is that the path must consist of exactly five segments, with four changes. So, the number of such paths is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1). Because for each starting direction, we compute the number of ways to
