Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are given as:

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)

First, I need to understand what functions f and g are. The problem defines \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) and \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \). So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. That usually creates a V-shaped graph, but since it's nested, maybe it's more complex.

Let me try to sketch or visualize f(x) first. Let's start with |x|. Then subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. But then take the absolute value of that, so ||x| - 1/2|. Hmm, so this is a transformation. The standard V-shape of |x| is shifted down by 1/2 and then reflected wherever it goes below zero. So the graph of f(x) would have a V at x=0, but shifted.

Wait, let me think more carefully. The function |x| - 1/2 is a V-shape with vertex at (0, -1/2). Then taking the absolute value of that would reflect the part below the x-axis. So f(x) will have a W shape, maybe? Let me find critical points.

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|

So, the function inside is |x| - 1/2. Let's find when |x| - 1/2 is negative. That's when |x| < 1/2, so x in (-1/2, 1/2). In this region, ||x| - 1/2| = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So in (-1/2,1/2), f(x) is 1/2 - |x|, which is a V shape peaking at 1/2 at x=0, going down to 0 at x=±1/2. Outside of that, when |x| ≥ 1/2, it's just |x| - 1/2, which is a V shape starting at x=±1/2, y=0, going up as |x| increases.

So, f(x) has a W-like shape, with peaks at x=0 (value 1/2) and at x=±1/2, it's 0. Then it increases again beyond |x| > 1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that.

g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Again, the inner function is |x| - 1/4. So when is that negative? When |x| < 1/4, so x in (-1/4, 1/4). Then, in that interval, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. So in (-1/4, 1/4), g(x) is a V shape peaking at 1/4 at x=0, going down to 0 at x=±1/4. Outside of that, when |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) is |x| - 1/4, which is a V shape starting from x=±1/4, y=0, increasing as |x| increases.

So g(x) has a W-like shape as well, peaks at x=0 (1/4) and is zero at x=±1/4, increasing beyond that.

Now, the functions y and x are defined in terms of 4g(f(...)). So let me consider what 4g(f(h)) would look like, where h is either sin(2πx) or cos(3πy).

First, maybe I should figure out the range of f and g. Since f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, the range is [0, 1/2], because |x| can be any non-negative real, so subtracting 1/2, the minimum is 0, and the maximum is when |x| is very large, so f(x) approaches infinity? Wait, no. Wait, |x| is unbounded, so f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| would go to infinity as |x| increases. But when you pass through g, which is ||x| - 1/4|, but then we multiply by 4. Hmm, perhaps I should consider the composition of functions.

Wait, let's think step by step.

For y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

First, f(sin(...)) would map sin(...) through f, then g, then multiplied by 4.

Let me find the range of sin(2πx). It's between -1 and 1. Then f(sin(...)) is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Since |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1, f(sin(...)) will be in [0, 1/2], because the maximum of | |sin| - 1/2 | is when |sin| is 0 or 1. At 0, it's 1/2; at 1, it's 1/2. So f(sin(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/2. Then, g is applied to that. So g takes a value between 0 and 1/2 and applies ||x| - 1/4|. Since x in g is between 0 and 1/2, let's see:

When x is in [0, 1/4], g(x) = 1/4 - x.

When x is in [1/4, 1/2], g(x) = x - 1/4.

So, the output of g(f(...)) is in [0, 1/4]. Because for x in [0,1/4], g(x) goes from 1/4 to 0 as x goes from 0 to 1/4. For x in [1/4, 1/2], g(x) goes from 0 back up to 1/4. So the maximum value of g(f(...)) is 1/4, and the minimum is 0.

Then, multiplying by 4, y = 4g(f(...)) would have a range of [0,1]. Similarly for x, same reasoning applies.

Wait, but for x, the equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So, the right-hand side is similar to the left-hand side y equation. So, 4 g(f(...)) maps to [0,1
