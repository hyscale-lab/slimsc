Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if its magnitude is given as |z| = 4, then z can be expressed in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can write z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). That might come in handy later.

So, the expression I need to evaluate is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me write this out more clearly:

Expression = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z

Since |z| = 4, then 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by |z|². Because, for any complex number z, 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|². Since |z| is 4, |z|² is 16. So, 1/z = \overline{z}/16.

Wait, let me check that. If z = a + bi, then \overline{z} = a - bi, and |z|² = a² + b². So yes, 1/z = \overline{z}/(a² + b²). Since |z|² is 16, that's correct.

So, substituting 1/z with \overline{z}/16, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)(\overline{z}) / 16

Hmm, that might be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, which could make things easier when dealing with powers.

Let me try that approach. Let z = 4e^{iθ}, so that 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Substituting into the expression:

(75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96
