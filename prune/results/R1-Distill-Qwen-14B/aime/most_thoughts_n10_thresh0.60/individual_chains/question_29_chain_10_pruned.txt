Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because without a clear picture, it's easy to get lost.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

First, let me sketch this out mentally. Rectangle ABCD: so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they must lie on a straight line. So, point E is between D and C, and F is another point further along that line. But wait, the order matters. Let me think: if D, E, C, F are collinear, does that mean they are in that order? So starting from D, going through E, then C, then F.

Now, the other condition is that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might be useful later on.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one side and AB is another. So, BC is the height, AB is the width. Wait, in rectangles, adjacent sides are length and width. So, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, ABCD has sides 107 and 16.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is one side, FG is another. So, EF is 184, FG is 17.

Wait, I need to clarify the sides. In rectangle EFGH, EF and FG are adjacent sides, so EF = 184, FG = 17. So, the sides of EFGH are 184 and 17.

Now, since D, E, C, F are collinear, and given that ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, I can imagine that these rectangles are placed such that one side of each rectangle is along the same line. Hmm.

Let me assign coordinates to figure this out. Coordinates could help me visualize the positions of the points.

Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0, 0), then C would be at (AB, 0) = (107, 0). Because AB is 107, which is the length of the side from A to B, but wait, in a rectangle, AB is adjacent to BC. So, perhaps I should consider the sides as AB and BC.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, BC is the next. So, if AB is 107
