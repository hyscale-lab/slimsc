Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis at a point that I think is part of an equilateral triangle, given the coordinates. Because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so that's a familiar value.

Then there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. Point P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So each PQ is like a line segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, with length 1, and both P and Q are in the first quadrant, so their coordinates are positive.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So AB is part of family F, right? Because AB is a segment from A on the x-axis to B on the y-axis, and the length of AB can be calculated.

Wait, actually, let me check the length of AB. The coordinates are A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Using the distance formula: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is a unit length segment, so AB is indeed in family F.

So, the problem is saying that C is a point on AB (so it's somewhere between A and B) such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from the family F except AB. So, if I imagine all these PQ segments, each connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis with length 1, then C is a point on AB that isn't intersected by any other such PQ segment except AB itself.

The goal is to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

So, I need to find point C on AB such that it's only on AB and no other PQ from F.

First, let me parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be represented parametrically.

Let me find the equation of AB. The slope of AB: (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Because it passes through A(1/2, 0), so plugging x=1/2, y=0 into the equation.

Simplify: y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). So that's the equation of AB.

Any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, we want to find a point C on AB such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB.

Each PQ segment is a unit length from the x-axis to the y-axis. So, for a given P(p, 0) on the x-axis, Q would be such that PQ has length 1. So let's find the relationship between p and q (the y-coordinate of Q). The segment PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, q), and its length is 1.

So, sqrt[(p - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2] = 1. Squaring both sides: p² + q² = 1.

Thus, for any PQ in F, the coordinates of P and Q must satisfy p² + q² = 1, with p > 0 and q > 0 since we're in the first quadrant.

So, each PQ is the line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), where p² + q² = 1.

Now, the equation of the line PQ can be found. Since it connects (p, 0) to (0, q), the slope is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. The equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

But since p² + q² = 1, maybe we can parameterize p and q in terms of an angle or something. Alternatively, we can express q in terms of p, or vice versa.

Since p² + q² = 1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p²), but since we're in the first quadrant, q is positive.

Alternatively, we can parametrize p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), but since p and q can be scaled, wait, no. Wait, p and q must satisfy p² + q² = 1, so they can be thought of as the cosine and sine of some angle theta. So, p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), with theta between 0 and pi/2 because p and q are positive.

So each PQ corresponds to an angle theta, and the equation becomes y = (-sin(theta)/cos(theta))x + sin(theta) = -tan(theta)x + sin(theta). That's another way to write the equation.

Alternatively, since tan(theta) = q/p, but maybe that's complicating things.

So, for any theta in (0, pi/2), we have a line PQ with equation y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

So, the family F is parameterized by theta, where each theta gives a line from (cos(theta), 0) to (0, sin(theta)), with the equation y = -tan(theta)x + sin(theta).

Now, the point C is on AB, so its coordinates are (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).

We need to find the point C on AB such that for all other thetas (other than the theta corresponding to AB), the point C does not lie on PQ(theta).

So, for all theta ≠ theta_AB, the point C is not on PQ(theta).

So, let's find theta_AB first. Since AB is a segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which corresponds to p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.

Indeed, p² + q² = (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which satisfies the condition. So, theta_AB is such that cos(theta_AB) = p = 1/2, and sin(theta_AB) = q = sqrt(3)/2. That would be theta = 60 degrees or pi/3 radians.

Therefore, the line AB has equation y = -tan(pi/3)x + sin(pi/3). Let's compute that.

tan(pi/3) is sqrt(3), and sin(pi/3) is sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, which matches our earlier equation of AB.

So, for each theta, we have a line PQ(theta): y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

We need to find point C on AB (so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) such that for all theta ≠ pi/3, the point C does not lie on PQ(theta).

So, for C to lie on PQ(theta), it must satisfy both equations: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 and y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

Therefore, setting them equal:

-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

Let's rearrange:

(-sqrt(3) + tan(theta))x = sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2.

So,

x = [sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2] / [tan(theta) - sqrt(3)].

But tan(theta) is sin(theta)/cos(theta), so let me rewrite:

x = [sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2] / [ (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) - sqrt(3) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by cos(theta) to eliminate the denominator:

x = [sin(theta)cos(theta) - (sqrt(3)/2)cos(theta)] / [sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)]

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, since C is on AB, let's parameterize C as a point along AB. Let me use a parameter t where t=0 corresponds to A(1/2, 0) and t=1 corresponds to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equations would be:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

So for t in [0,1], x goes from
