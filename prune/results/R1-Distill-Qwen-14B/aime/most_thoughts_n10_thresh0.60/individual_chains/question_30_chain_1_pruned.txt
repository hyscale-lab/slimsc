Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says that ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but I think I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that will help yet.

The expression I need to compute is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that down more clearly:

∏ₖ₌₀^12 (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω^{2k})

Hmm, that's a product of 13 terms. Each term is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor each term or find a pattern.

Wait, each term is of the form 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me see if I can write that as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me denote z = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z².

So, the term is z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, can I factor this quadratic? Let me check the discriminant: D = (−2)² − 4*1*2 = 4 − 8 = -4. So, it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over some extension. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this quadratic to another polynomial.

Wait, maybe instead of factoring the quadratic, I can consider the product over all k of (z² - 2z + 2) where z = ω^k. So, for each k, we plug in ω^k into the quadratic, and then take the product over all 13th roots of unity.

But wait, hold on. For each k, ω^k ranges over all 13th roots of unity, because ω is primitive 13th root, so k=0 gives 1, and k=1 to 12 give the other roots. So, the product becomes:

∏_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2)

Because as k goes from 0 to 12, z=ω^k cycles through all 13th roots of unity. So, I have the product over all roots z of z² - 2z + 2.

Wait, but the product over all roots of a polynomial evaluated at a function is related to the value of that function at the roots. Hmm, but in this case, I'm taking the product of (
