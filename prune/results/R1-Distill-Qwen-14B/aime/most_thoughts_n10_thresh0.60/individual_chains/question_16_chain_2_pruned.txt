Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says, Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I then have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

Alright, so let's start by understanding the problem. For a prime p, we're looking for n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That means n⁴ +1 is a multiple of p².

I remember that for primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, there exists some n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But here, we're dealing with p², so it's more restrictive.

I think I should start testing small primes and see if n⁴ +1 can be divisible by p². Let's list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's check n=1: 1⁴ +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4, not 0. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. Hmm, nothing. Wait, maybe I need a larger n? Wait, but 2²=4. Let's see n=1: 2, n=2:17, n=3:82, n=4: 256 +1=257, which is 1 mod 4. Doesn't seem like any n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1,2,...,8.

n=1: 1 +1=2 mod 9
n=2: 16 +1=17= 8 mod9
n=3: 81 +1=82=1 mod9
n=4: (256 mod9). 256/9 is 28*9=252, so 256-252=4. 4 +1=5 mod9
n=5: 625 mod9. 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. 4 +1=5 mod9
n=6: 6⁴=1296, 1296 mod9=0, so 0+1=1 mod9
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401/9: 266*9=2394, 2401-2394=7. 7+1=8 mod9
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, 19 mod9=1; so 1 +1=2 mod9.

Wait, so n⁴ mod9 is 1,2,5,8, etc. So n⁴ +1 mod9 is 2,3,6,9… which is 0 when n⁴ +1 is 9, 18, etc. Looking at the calculations:

n=1:2, n=2:8+1=9? Wait, n=2: n⁴=16, 16 mod9 is 7, 7+1=8 mod9. Wait, wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, let's recalculate n=2: 2⁴=16, 16 mod9 is 7 (since 9*1=9, 16-9=7). So 7 +1=8 mod9.

Wait, n=3: 3⁴=81, which is 0 mod9, so 0 +1=1 mod9.

n=4: 4⁴=256. Let's compute 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9, 4+1=5.

n=5: 5⁴=625. 625/9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. 4+1=5.

n=6: 6⁴=1296, which is 0 mod9, 0+1=1.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. Let's compute 2401 mod9. Sum the digits: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod9. 7+1=8.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, 19 mod9=1. So 1 +1=2.

So n⁴ +1 mod9 is 2,8,1,5,5,1,8,2 for n=1 to8. So the possible residues are 1,2,5,8. So n⁴ +1 mod9 is never 0. So p=3 doesn't work.

Next prime: p=5. Let's check if there exists n with n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

First, maybe check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod5. Let's see.

Compute n⁴ mod5 for n: 1,2,3,4.

n=1:1 mod5

n=2:16 mod5=1

n=3:81 mod5=1

n=4:256 mod5=1

So n⁴ ≡1 mod5 for any n not divisible by5.

Thus, n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod5, which is not 0. So n⁴ +1 can't be 0 mod5, hence can't be 0 mod25. So p=5 is out.

Next prime: p=7.

First, check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod7. Let's compute n⁴ mod7 for n=1 to6.

n=1:1 mod7

n=2:16 mod7=2

n=3:81 mod7: 7*11=77, 81
