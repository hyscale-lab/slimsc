Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, what does b-eautiful mean again? Let me read the problem again.

It says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. Oh, right, like the example given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me break this down. For a given base b, any two-digit number in base b can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The two-digit number in base b is then n = a * b + c. The sum of the digits is a + c. The condition for b-eautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, substituting n, we get:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So for each base b, and for each possible c, we can try to solve for a and see if it's a valid digit (i.e., integer between 1 and b-1).

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the original equation to solve for b:

From (a + c)^2 = a b + c,

We can express b as:

b = ( (a + c)^2 - c ) / a

Simplify that:

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c ) / a
= a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, the term (c² - c)/a must be an integer. So, (c² - c) must be divisible by a. That is, a must be a divisor of c² - c.

Given that a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1, perhaps we can find possible a and c pairs that satisfy this divisibility condition, and then compute b accordingly.

Wait, but b is also dependent on a and c, so maybe it's better to look for a given b, how many (a, c) pairs exist such that a + c = sqrt(a*b + c).

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as:

Let s = a + c, so s = sqrt(n) = sqrt(a*b + c)

Then, s² = a*b + c

So, we have a*b + c = s²

But s = a + c, so substituting:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Which is the same equation as before.

So, the equation is:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

Which is:

b = [ (a
