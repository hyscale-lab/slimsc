Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So it's a triangle where the sides are 5, 9, 10. Hmm, that's a scalene triangle. Let me check if it's a right triangle or something. Let's see: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is less than 10²=100? Wait, no, 10² is 100, but 5² + 9² is 106, which is more than 100. So it's an acute triangle? Wait, no, actually, if a² + b² > c², then the angle opposite c is acute. So since 5² + 9² > 10², angle at A is acute. I think that's correct.

But maybe that's not directly relevant. Let me think about the circle ω. Since ABC is inscribed in ω, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, no, the intersection of the two tangents is called the exsimilicenter or something? Hmm. Alternatively, D is the point from which tangents are drawn to ω at B and C.

So D lies on the external tangent from B and C. Wait, the tangent at B and tangent at C meet at D. So D is the external homothety center? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, when
