Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Hmm, okay. So the task is to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Then, given that p, find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes for which -1 is a quadratic residue are primes congruent to 1 mod 4. But wait, that's about n² + 1 being divisible by p. But here it's n⁴ + 1, which is a bit different. Maybe I should think about it in terms of modular arithmetic.

So, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². That suggests that the multiplicative order of n modulo p² divides 8. But the multiplicative group mod p² has order p(p-1), so the order of n must divide both 8 and p(p-1). Since p is prime, the order divides 8 and (p-1) or p. But p is prime, so unless p is 2, which is even, but let's check p=2 first.

Wait, hold on. Let me think about p=2. If p=2, then p²=4. Does n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 4 have a solution? Let's see n can be 1: 1+1=2 mod4, which is 2, not 0. n=2: 16+1=17≡1 mod4. n=3: 81+1=82≡2 mod4. So no solution. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is 3. Let's check n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9.

Compute n⁴ mod9. Let me compute n from 1 to 8 mod9.

n=1: 1

n=2: 16 mod9=7

n=3: 81 mod9=0

n=4: (256) mod9. 256 /9= 28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4.

n=5: 625 mod9. 625 divided by 9: 69*9=621, 625-621=4. So 4.

n=6: 1296 mod9=0.

n=7: 7⁴= (49)^2=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7. 2401-7=2394, which is 266*9=2394. So 7.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4+0+9+6=19→1+9=10→1. 4096 mod9 is 1.

Looking for n where n⁴≡-1≡8 mod9. Looking at the results:

n=1:1, n=2:7, n=3:0, n=4:4, n=5:4, n=6:0, n=7:7, n=8:1.

So none of them give 8 mod9. So p=3 is out.

Next prime is 5. Let's try p=5, p²=25.

We need n⁴ ≡-1 mod25. Let's compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24, but maybe some patterns can help.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the multiplicative group mod25. The multiplicative group has order φ(25)=20. So n^20 ≡1 mod25 for n coprime to25.

Looking for n where n⁴ ≡-1 mod25. Let me square both sides: n^8 ≡1 mod25, so the order of n divides 8, but also the order divides 20. So the order must divide gcd(8,20)=4.

Wait, but if n^4 ≡-1, then n^8≡1. So the order must be 8? Because if the order was 4, then n^4≡1≡-1 mod25? But 1≡-1 mod25 would imply 25 divides 2, which it doesn't. So the order must be 8. But in mod25, the multiplicative group has order 20, so 8 divides 20? Wait, 20 divided by 8 is 2.5, which is not integer. So 8 does not divide 20, which is a problem. Hmm, so perhaps there's no such n for p=5?

Wait, but maybe I should check manually. Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to, say, 12, and see if any of them give 24 (since -1≡24 mod25).

n=1:1

n=2:16

n=3:81 mod25=6

n=4:256 mod25=6

n=5:0

n=6:1296 mod25. 1296/25=51*25=1275, 1296-1275=21.

n=7:7⁴=49²=2401 mod25. 2400 is 96*25, so 2401 mod25=1.

n=8:8²=64; 64²=4096 mod25. 4096-163*25=4096-4075=21.

n=9:9²=81; 81²=6561. 6561 mod25: 6560 is 262*25=6550, 6561-6550=11.

n=10:0

n=11:11²=121; 121²=14641. 14641 mod25: 14625 is 585*25, 14641-14625=16.

n=12:12²=144; 144²=20736. 20736 mod25: 20700 is 828*25=20700, so 20736-20700=36→36-25=11.

Hmm, so from n=1 to 12, the n⁴ mod25 are: 1,16,6,6,0,21,1,21,11,0,16,11.

I don't see 24 in there. Maybe I should try n=13.

n=13: 13²=169 mod25=19; 19²=361 mod25=11.

n=14:14²=196 mod25=21; 21²=441 mod25=16.

n=15:0

n=16:16²=256 mod25=6; 6²=36 mod25=11.

n=17:17²=289 mod25=14; 14²=196 mod25=21.

n=18:18²=324 mod25=24; 24²=576 mod25=1.

n=19:19²=361 mod25=11; 11²=121 mod25=21.

n=20:0

n=21:21²=441 mod25=16; 16²=256 mod25=6.

n=22:22²=484 mod25=9; 9²=81 mod25=6.

n=23:23²=529 mod25=4; 4²=16 mod25.

n=24:24²=576 mod25=1; 1²=1.

So, in all cases, n⁴ mod25 is one of 0,1,6,11,16,21. None of these are 24. So p=5 also doesn't work.

Next prime:7. Let's see if p=7, p²=49.

We need n⁴ ≡-1 mod49. So n⁴≡48 mod49.

Again, perhaps the multiplicative order. The group mod49 has order φ(49)=42. So if n⁴≡-1, then n^8≡1 mod49. So the order of n divides 8, but also must divide 42. The gcd(8,42)=2. So the order must divide 2, but n^4≡-1, so n^2 would be sqrt(-1) mod49. But wait, is there a square root of -1 mod49?

Wait, first, let's check if -1 is a quadratic residue mod7. Since 7≡3 mod4, -1 is not a quadratic residue mod7. So that suggests that there's no solution for n²≡-1 mod7, which would imply no solution mod49. But wait, maybe it's possible through Hensel's lemma? Wait, no, if there's no solution mod7, then there can't be a solution mod49. So p=7 is out.

So next prime is 11? Wait no, after 7 comes 11? No, 7, then 11, but wait, wait, 13 is after 11. Wait, no, primes are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17, etc. So after 7, the next primes are 11,13, etc.

Wait, perhaps I missed p=17? Wait, no, 11 comes before 13, but perhaps I need to check p=17.

Wait, let me reorganize. So p=2,3,5,7 don't work. So the next candidate is p=17? Wait, but wait, perhaps p
