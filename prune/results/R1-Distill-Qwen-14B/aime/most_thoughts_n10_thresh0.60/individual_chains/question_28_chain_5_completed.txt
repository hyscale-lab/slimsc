Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem to solve. Let's see, the tetrahedron is called ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. Interesting, it looks like the opposite edges are equal in length. That probably means the tetrahedron has some sort of symmetry. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron or something like that.

The question is about finding a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. This point is called the incenter, I think, similar to the incenter in a triangle. In a triangle, the incenter is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all sides. For a tetrahedron, the incenter should be equidistant from all four faces. That distance is what we're looking for.

The problem says this distance can be written as m√n / p, where m, n, and p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then we need to find m + n + p.

So, how do we find the distance from the incenter to a face in a tetrahedron? I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (which is the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of the four faces). So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.

First, let's figure out the surface area. Each face is a triangle, and we have six edges given. But since opposite edges are equal, all the faces are congruent triangles? Wait, not necessarily congruent, but each pair of opposite edges are equal. Let me list out all the edges:

AB = √41
AC = √80
AD = √89
BC = √89
BD = √80
CD = √41

So, each face is a triangle with sides:

Face ABC: AB=√41, BC=√89, AC=√80
Face ABD: AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89
Face ACD: AC=√80, CD=√41, AD=√89
Face BCD: BC=√89, CD=√41, BD=√80

So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. That is, all four faces are congruent triangles. That's a helpful symmetry. So, each face has the same area, so the surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.

So, first, let's find the area of one face. Let's pick triangle ABC with sides a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

Wait, hold on. Let me check that, because √41, √80, √89 — are these right triangles? Let's see: 41 + 80 is 121, which is 11². So, 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², so √41² + √80² = (√41)^2 + (√80)^2 = 41 + 80 = 121 = (√121)^2 = 11². So, triangle ABC is a right triangle with legs √41 and √80, and hypotenuse √89.

That's a big help because the area of a right triangle is (1/2)*leg1*leg2. So, area of ABC is (1/2)*√41*√80.

Let me compute that:

√41 * √80 = √(41*80) = √(3280). Hmm, but 80 is 16*5, so √80 = 4√5. So, √41 * 4√5 = 4√(41*5) = 4√205.

So, area is (1/2)*4√205 = 2√205.

So each face has area 2√205. Then, the total surface area S is 4*(2√205) = 8√205.

Okay, that's the surface area.

Now, I need the volume V of the tetrahedron. Computing the volume of a tetrahedron can be tricky. But, since all edges are given, maybe we can use the formula involving the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:

CM = | 0 1 1 1 1 |
     | 1 0 AB² AC² AD² |
     | 1 AB² 0 BC² BD² |
     | 1 AC² BC² 0 CD² |
     | 1 AD² BD² CD² 0 |

The volume V is then sqrt( CM / 288 ).

But this determinant might be a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, since the opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is "equifacial" or something, but maybe we can find coordinates for the points and compute the volume from there.

Let me try the coordinate approach. Let's assign coordinates to the four points such that the tetrahedron can be embedded in 3D space with certain symmetries.

Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe we can set the points symmetrically. Let me think about how to place the points.

Let’s denote the points as A, B, C, D.

Let me place point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This way, the opposite edges will have the same lengths because of the symmetric placement.

Now, let's compute the distances between these points.

AB: distance between A and B.

A is (x, y, z), B is (-x, -y, z). So, AB² = ( -x -x )² + ( -y - y )² + ( z - z )² = ( -2x )² + ( -2y )² + 0 = 4x² + 4y².

Similarly, CD is between C (-x, y, -z) and D (x, -y, -z). So CD² = (x - (-x))² + (-y - y)^2 + (-z - (-z))²
= (2x)^2 + (-2y)^2 + 0 = 4x² + 4y².

So AB² = CD² = 4x² + 4y² = 41.

Similarly, let's compute AC².

A is (x, y, z), C is (-x, y, -z). So AC² = (-x -x)^2 + (y - y)^2 + (-z - z)^2 = (-2x)^2 + 0 + (-2z)^2 = 4x² + 4z².

Given AC² = 80, so 4x² + 4z² = 80 => x² + z² = 20.

Similarly, BD is between B (-x, -y, z) and D (x, -y, -z). So BD² = (x - (-x))² + (-y - (-y))² + (-z - z)^2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (-2z)^2 = 4x² + 4z² = 80.

So that's consistent.

Next, let's compute BC².

Point B (-x, -y, z) to point C (-x, y, -z). So BC² = ( -x - (-x) )² + (y - (-y) )² + (-z - z)^2 = 0 + (2y)^2 + (-2z)^2 = 4y² + 4z².

Given BC² = 89, so 4y² + 4z² = 89 => y² + z² = 89/4.

Similarly, AD is between A (x, y, z) and D (x, -y, -z). So AD² = (x -x)^2 + (-y - y)^2 + (-z - z)^2 = 0 + (-2y)^2 + (-2z)^2 = 4y² + 4z² = 89.

So, that's consistent.

So now, we have:

1. AB² = CD² = 4x² + 4y² = 41 => x² + y² = 41/4.

2. AC² = BD² = 4x² + 4z² = 80 => x² + z² = 20.

3. BC² = AD² = 4y² + 4z² = 89 => y² + z² = 89/4.

So, we have three equations:

Equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4.

Equation 2: x² + z² = 20.

Equation 3: y² + z² = 89/4.

We can solve for x², y², z².

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1: (x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = 20 - 41/4

Simplify: z² - y² = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.

Similarly, from equation 3: y² + z² = 89/4.

So now, we have:

z² - y² = 39/4.

z² + y² = 89/4.

We can solve these two equations.

Adding both equations: 2z² = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 => z² = 16 => z = 4 or z = -4. But since z is squared, we can take z=4.

Then, from equation 3: y² = 89/4 - z² = 89/4 - 16 = 89/4 - 64/4 = 25/4 => y = 5/2 or y = -5/2.

From equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4. Since y²=25/4, then x² = 41/4 -25/4=16/4=4 => x=2 or x=-2.

So, x=2, y=5/2, z=4. These are the coordinates for point A. So, the coordinates are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)

B: (-2, -5/2, 4)

C: (-2, 5/2, -4)

D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Wait, let me confirm the coordinates:

Wait, I defined point B as (-x, -y, z), so if A is (x, y, z), then B is (-x, -y, z). So, with x=2, y=5/2, z=4, point B is (-2, -5/2, 4).

Similarly, point C is (-x, y, -z) = (-2, 5/2, -4).

Point D is (x, -y, -z) = (2, -5/2, -4).

Yes, that looks correct.

Now, with these coordinates, we can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. The volume can be found using the scalar triple product formula. The formula is:

V = | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6

First, we need vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, let's compute vectors from point A.

Vector AB is B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0).

Vector AC is C - A = (-2 -2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8).

Vector AD is D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8).

So, vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AC = (-4, 0, -8), AD = (0, -5, -8).

Now, compute the cross product of AC and AD.

Let me calculate cross product AC × AD.

AC = (-4, 0, -8)
AD = (0, -5, -8)

The cross product is:

|i    j    k|
|-4    0   -8|
|0   -5   -8|

= i*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-8)) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i: (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = (0 - 40) = -40
j: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-8) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32
k: ( (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 ) = 20 - 0 = 20

So, AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, compute the dot product of AB and this cross product.

AB = (-4, -5, 0)
AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Dot product: (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.

So, the absolute value is 320, and the volume V is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.

Wait, 320 divided by 6 is 160/3. That simplifies to 160/3.

So, volume V is 160/3.

Wait, that seems a bit large, but let me double-check the calculations.

First, AB vector: from A(2,5/2,4) to B(-2,-5/2,4): change in x: -4, y: -5, z:0. Correct.

AC: from A(2,5/2,4) to C(-2,5/2,-4): x: -4, y:0, z:-8. Correct.

AD: from A(2,5/2,4) to D(2,-5/2,-4): x:0, y:-5, z:-8. Correct.

Then cross product:

i: (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = 0 -40 = -40

j: - [ (-4)*(-8) -0*(-8) ] = - [32 -0] = -32

k: (-4*(-5) -0*0) = 20 -0 =20

So cross product is (-40, -32, 20).

Dot product with AB: (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) +0*20 = 160 + 160 +0=320.

So, yes, 320/6=160/3. So V=160/3.

But let me think, is this the correct way to compute the volume? Because in the cross product, the volume is | (AB · (AC × AD)) | /6, but AB, AC, AD are vectors from the same point A, so that's correct.

Alternatively, if the coordinates are correct, then this is the volume. Let me think about whether that makes sense.

Given the edge lengths, it's plausible. Alternatively, another way to compute the volume is using the formula for a tetrahedron with congruent opposite edges.

Wait, is there another formula? The volume can be calculated if we know all edges, but that would require the Cayley-Menger determinant, which we can try.

But since I already have the coordinates and the volume via scalar triple product, perhaps that's sufficient.

So, V=160/3.

Now, the surface area S is 8√205, as computed earlier.

So, the inradius r is 3V/S.

Wait, because the formula is r = 3V / S.

So, substituting:

r = 3*(160/3) / (8√205) = (160) / (8√205) = 20 / √205.

Simplify that:

r = 20 / √205.

We can rationalize the denominator:

r = (20√205) / 205 = (4√205)/41.

Because 20 and 205 have a common factor. 205 is 5*41, and 20 is 4*5, so we can divide numerator and denominator by 5.

20 / 205 = 4 / 41.

So, r= (4√205)/41.

Wait, let me confirm:

20 / √205 = multiply numerator and denominator by √205:

20√205 / (√205 * √205) = 20√205 / 205.

205=5*41, and 20=4*5. So, 20/205 = (4*5)/(41*5) = 4/41.

So, 20√205 / 205 = (4√205)/41.

Yes, so r=4√205 /41.

So, this is in the form m√n / p, where m=4, n=205, p=41.

We need to make sure that n is square-free. 205 factors into 5*41, both primes, so yes, square-free.

Also, m and p must be coprime. 4 and 41 are coprime, since 41 is prime and doesn't divide 4.

So, the distance is 4√205 /41.

Thus, m=4, n=205, p=41. So, m + n + p =4 + 205 + 41= 250.

Wait, 4+205=209, 209+41=250. So, the answer is 250.

But let me double-check to see if I made any mistakes in the calculations.

First, surface area: each face is a right triangle with legs √41 and √80. So area is (1/2)*√41*√80.

√80 is 4√5, so 1/2 * √41 *4√5 = 2√(41*5)=2√205. So each face is 2√205, four faces gives 8√205. That seems correct.

Volume via coordinates: placed points symmetrically, computed vectors, cross product, dot product, got 320, so 320/6=160/3. That seems correct.

Inradius formula: r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(8√205)=160/(8√205)=20/√205=4√205/41. Yes.

So, all steps look correct. Therefore, the answer is 4 + 205 +41=250.


The tetrahedron has edges such that opposite edges are equal, indicating a symmetrical structure. To find the inradius (distance from the incenter to each face), we first calculate the surface area and volume of the tetrahedron.

Each face is a right triangle with legs √41 and √80, giving an area of \(2\sqrt{205}\). The total surface area is \(4 \times 2\sqrt{205} = 8\sqrt{205}\).

Using coordinates for the vertices, the volume is calculated via the scalar triple product, resulting in \(V = \frac{160}{3}\).

The inradius formula \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\) yields \(r = \frac{4\sqrt{205}}{41}\). Thus, \(m = 4\), \(n = 205\), and \(p = 41\), leading to \(m + n + p = 250\).

\boxed{250}
