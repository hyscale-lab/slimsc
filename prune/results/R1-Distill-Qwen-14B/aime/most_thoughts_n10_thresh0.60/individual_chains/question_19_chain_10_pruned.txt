Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB · AC. 

Hmm, okay. So, the circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. I remember that O is the circumcenter, so it's the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle. I is the incenter, so it's the intersection of the angle bisectors.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can use some properties or formulas related to the inradius, circumradius, and distances between incenter and circumcenter. I recall that there's a formula for the distance between O and I, which is OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me verify that. Yes, that formula is correct when the incenter and circumcenter are in a certain position. So, let me compute OI first.

OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)) = sqrt(13(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13 * 1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13). 

But wait, in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at A. That must mean that IA is the altitude from A to OI in triangle IAO, but since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IAO is right-angled at A. So, in triangle IAO, we have OA as the hypotenuse. Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. Because in any triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is the circumradius R.

So, OA = 13, IA is one leg, OI is the other leg, and angle at A is 90 degrees. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

OA² = IA² + OI²

We know OA is 13, OI is sqrt(13), so:

13² = IA² + (sqrt(13))²
169 = IA² + 13
IA² = 169 -13 = 156
So IA = sqrt(156). Simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA = 2√39.

Okay, so IA is 2√39, which is the length of the inradius from I to A. Wait, no, IA is not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, but IA is the distance from I to vertex A. So IA is different from the inradius, which is given as 6. 

Hmm, that's something. So, maybe we can relate IA to other elements of the triangle. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.

I remember that the distance from the inradius to a vertex, like IA, can be given by IA = r / sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. 

Actually, the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle is more complicated, but maybe for the inradius, there's a relation. Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities.

Wait, in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at A, so IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle AIO, angle at A is 90°, sides IA, AO, and OI. So, maybe I can express IA in terms of other parameters.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me
