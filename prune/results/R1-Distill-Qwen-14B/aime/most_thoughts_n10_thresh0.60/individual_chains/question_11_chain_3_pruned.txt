Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. The problem is to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that z is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, I can represent z as 4e^{iθ}, since the magnitude is 4, and θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, z can be written as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). That might come in handy later.

Now, the expression we're dealing with is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote this expression as E. So, E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

I need to find the maximum real part of E. So, I should probably express E in terms of θ and then find the real part, then maximize it with respect to θ.

Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}, which would make 1/z equal to (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since |z| = 4. So, substituting these into E:

E = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each term separately. First, compute (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Multiplying the constants: 75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468. So, this becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Similarly, for the second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) = 24 + 36i. So, this term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now, E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

To compute E, I can express each term using Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's expand each term:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i + 468*(-1) sinθ
= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + ( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i + 36 sinθ
= (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

Now, adding both terms together to get E:

E = [ (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) ] + [ (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i ]

Let me compute the real and imaginary parts separately.

Real part:
= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary part:
= (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So, E has real part 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ and imaginary part 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But we only care about the real part for the maximum, so let me focus on Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of Re(E), which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Hmm, this looks like a sinusoidal function, which can be written in the form A cosθ + B sinθ, but in our case, it's A cosθ + B sinθ, where A = 324 and B = -432. Wait, no, actually, it's A cosθ + B sinθ, but with B negative. So, perhaps I can write this as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.

Yes, the method is to express A cosθ + B sinθ as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, actually, the exact formula is A cosθ + B sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and tanφ = B/A.

But let me make sure about the sign. Let me think: if I have A cosθ + B sinθ, then R is sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ is such that cosφ = A/R and sinφ = B/R. So, the formula is correct.

In our case, A = 324, B = -432. So, R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Compute R:

324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.

324 * 324:

Well, 300^2 = 90,000

24^2 = 576

Cross term: 2 * 300 * 24 = 14,400

So, 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 432 * 432.

Let me compute that:

400^2 = 160,000

32^2 = 1,024

Cross term: 2 * 400 * 32 = 25,600

So, 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600; plus 1,024 is 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What is sqrt(291,600)? Let's see: 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2 = 291,600.

Yes, because 54^2 = 2,916, so 540^2 is 291,600.

So, R = 540.

Therefore, Re(E) can be written as 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is such that cosφ = 324/540 and sinφ = (-432)/540.

Wait, let me double-check that. Since A is 324, which is positive, and B is -432, which is negative, the angle φ should be in the fourth quadrant because cosφ is positive and sinφ is negative.

Compute cosφ = A/R = 324/540 = 0.6. So, cosφ = 0.6.

Similarly, sinφ = B/R = (-432
