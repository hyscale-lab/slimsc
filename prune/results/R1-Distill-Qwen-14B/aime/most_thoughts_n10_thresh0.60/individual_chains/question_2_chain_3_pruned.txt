Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the problem introduces points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), which is the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's on the x-axis, halfway between O and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is on the y-axis. Hmm, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so a bit less than 1. 

Then, there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis. So, imagine a line segment starting on the x-axis somewhere, going to the y-axis somewhere else, with length exactly 1. 

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, not A or B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB. So, AB is part of F, right? Because AB is a segment from A to B, and I can check the length of AB.

Wait, let me compute the length of AB to see if it's a unit length. Points A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance between them is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is indeed a unit segment and is part of the family F. So, C is on AB but not at A or B, and C is only on AB among all the segments in F.

So, we need to find point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other segment in F. Then, we need to compute OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

Let me visualize this. The first quadrant, with O at the origin. A is on the x-axis, B on the y-axis. AB is a unit segment. Then, the family F consists of all possible unit segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ in F has P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, PQ length 1.

So, for each such PQ, it's like a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p and q positive real numbers, and sqrt(p² + q²) = 1.

Wait, no, because the segment is of unit length, so the distance between P(p,0) and Q(0,q) is 1. So, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, for each such segment, p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1.

So, the family F is all such segments PQ where P is (p,0), Q is (0,q), and p² + q² = 1, with p and q positive since we're in the first quadrant.

Our point C is on AB, and we need to find it such that it's only on AB among all these segments. So, C is on AB, and for every other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, essentially, C is the point on AB that isn't intersected by any other segment from F except AB itself.

Wait, but AB is part of F, so C is on AB and on no other PQ in F. So, how do we find such a point?

Hmm. Maybe we can parametrize AB and find the point C where, for any other segment PQ in F, the point C doesn't lie on PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is such that the lines PQ in F
