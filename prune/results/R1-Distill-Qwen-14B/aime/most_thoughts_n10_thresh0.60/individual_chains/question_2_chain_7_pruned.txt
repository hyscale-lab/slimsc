Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle OAB. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is like a line segment of length 1 starting from some point P on the x-axis and ending at some point Q on the y-axis.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from family F except for AB itself. So, C is a point on AB that isn't covered by any other PQ segment in F. We need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

Hmm, so first, maybe I should find the equation of line AB. Let's see, points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB would be (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c. So c = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be parameterized. Let's say C is (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

Now, we need to find the point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment PQ from family F except AB. So, for all other PQ segments, C shouldn't lie on them.

Since each PQ is of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, the coordinates of P are (p, 0) and Q are (0, q), with sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Also, the equation of the segment PQ can be found. The line PQ connects (p, 0) and (0, q). The equation is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, for a point (x, y) to lie on PQ, it must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1.

But since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2). But since we're dealing with the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

Wait, but the problem is about point C not lying on any PQ except AB. So, for the point C on AB, except for AB itself, none of the other PQ's should pass through C.

But AB is one such PQ. Let's check: AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in family F.

Therefore, point C is on AB, but it should not lie on any other PQ in F. So, we need to find such a C. It's unique, so there must be only one such point.

I think this point C is the point where the envelope of all the segments PQ touches AB. The envelope is the curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, the point C is where the envelope is tangent to AB.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point on AB that is closest to the origin? Or maybe it's where the distance from AB to O is minimized? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as an optimization problem. For each point C on AB, determine if it's on any PQ other than AB. We need to find the point C such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB.

Let me express this. Given a point C(x, y) on AB, we have y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Suppose that C lies on another segment PQ, which is different from AB. Then, for some p, q, we have x/p + y/q = 1, and p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, substituting y from AB's equation into PQ's equation:

x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.

Multiply both sides by pq:

x q + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) p = pq.

Let me rearrange:

x(q - sqrt(3) p) + (sqrt(3)/2) p = pq.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

x (q - sqrt(3) p) + (sqrt(3)/2) p - pq = 0.

But p^2 + q^2 =1, so maybe we can express q in terms of p or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps treating this as a system of equations. Let's
