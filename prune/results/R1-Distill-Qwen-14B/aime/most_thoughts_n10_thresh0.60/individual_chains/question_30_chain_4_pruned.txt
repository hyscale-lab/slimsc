Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. 

First, I remember that roots of unity have some special properties. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω¹³ = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

The expression I'm dealing with is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ). Let me denote each term in the product as P(k) = 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ. I need to compute the product P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} P(k).

Hmm, multiplying all these terms together sounds complicated. Maybe there's a way to rewrite each P(k) in a more manageable form. Let me see:

P(k) = 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ. Let's factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - ωᵏ) + ω²ᵏ. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor out a ω²ᵏ? Let's try:

P(k) = ω²ᵏ(2ω^{-2k} - 2ω^{-k} + 1). Hmm, not sure if that helps either. Maybe factor it differently. Let me think about whether this is a quadratic in ωᵏ.

Let me set z = ωᵏ. Then P(k) becomes 2 - 2z + z². So P(k) = z² - 2z + 2. That's a quadratic in z. Now, since z is a 13th root of unity, each z satisfies z¹³ = 1.

So now, the product P is the product over all z where z¹³ = 1, except z=1 (since ω is not 1, but when k=0, ω⁰=1). Wait, no: when k=0, ω⁰=1, so z=1 is included when k=0. So actually, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including z=1.

Wait, but in the given problem, ω ≠ 1 is a 13th root of unity. So, does the product include k=0? Let me check the problem statement again. It says k=0 to 12, so yes, it includes k=0. So, z=1 is included when k=0. So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity.

But wait, if I take the product over all z where z¹
