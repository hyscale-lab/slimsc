Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when you read the grid left to right, the sum of the two numbers formed is 999. Also, when you read it top to bottom, the sum of the three numbers formed should be 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid first. It's a 2x3 grid, meaning 2 rows and 3 columns. So, the first row will form a three-digit number, and the second row will form another three-digit number. Similarly, each column will form a two-digit number, right?

Wait, hold on. When reading left to right, each row forms a three-digit number. So the first row is ABC, and the second row is DEF, where A, B, C, D, E, F are digits. So the sum ABC + DEF should be 999.

When reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number: AD, BE, CF. So the sum AD + BE + CF should be 99. 

Wait, let me confirm: the grid is 2x3. So each column has two cells. So the first column is A and D, making the number AD. Similarly, the second column is B and E, making BE, and the third column is C and F, making CF. So the sum AD + BE + CF = 99.

So, I have two equations:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit (0-9). But wait, A and D can't both be zero because then ABC and DEF would start with zero, making them two-digit or one-digit numbers, which isn't allowed. Hmm, but actually, the problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right", so ABC and DEF are two numbers, each three digits? Or could they be two-digit or one-digit?

Wait, looking back at the example given: the first row is 0,0,8, which is 008, but that's essentially 8, a single digit. The second row is 9,9,1, which is 991. So 8
