Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my set theory, but I think I can handle this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Alright, let's break down the information given:

- Total residents: 900. So that's the universal set, right?
- Number of residents who own a diamond ring: 195.
- Number who own a set of golf clubs: 367.
- Number who own a garden spade: 562.
- Everyone also owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's four items in total each resident could own.

Wait, but the question is about how many own all four. So, I need to find the number of residents who own diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Let me denote these as D, G, S, and C respectively.

I remember that the inclusion-exclusion principle can help here. But I think this problem is a bit more complex because it involves four sets. Let me recall the formula. For four sets, the principle is a bit longer, but since we're dealing with exactly two and exactly three, maybe I can combine it with the given data.

Wait, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, maybe I can use that information to find the number who own all four.

Let me jot down the variables:

- Let a be the number of residents who own exactly two items.
- Let b be the number who own exactly three.
- Let c be the number who own all four.

So, a = 437, b = 234, c = ?

Each resident owns at least one item because everyone has a candy heart. So, the total number of residents is the sum of all possible overlaps. But I'm a bit confused about how to structure this.

Alternatively, I can think about the total number of items owned. Let me calculate that. Each resident owns 1 (candy hearts) plus maybe 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 other items. But perhaps that's a more complicated approach.
