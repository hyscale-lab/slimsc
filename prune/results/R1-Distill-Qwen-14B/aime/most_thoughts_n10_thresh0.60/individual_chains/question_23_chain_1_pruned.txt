Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

Now, the problem says that points A, B, C, and D are on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, and they cross at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at 90 degrees only if it's a square. Hmm, wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, yes, I think that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the rhombus is symmetric about the origin.

So, let me try to visualize this. If the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), because the origin is the midpoint. Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q). So, the four points are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But maybe another approach is better. Since it's a rhombus, the vectors of the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

Wait, actually, no. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.

So, vector AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q).

Wait, no. Wait, the diagonal AC is connecting A and C, which are (x,y) and (-x,-
