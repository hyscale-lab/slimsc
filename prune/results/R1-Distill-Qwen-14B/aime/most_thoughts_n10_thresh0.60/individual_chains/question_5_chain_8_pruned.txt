Okay, so I have this problem about a triangle ABC where eight circles of radius 34 are placed in a certain way, and then it says that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged similarly. I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC expressed as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. The problem mentions that the circles are "sequentially tangent." I think that means each circle is tangent to the next one in the sequence. Also, two of the circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of the triangle. So, maybe these circles are like incircles or excircles, but placed along two sides.

Wait, maybe it's similar to how circles can be tangent to two sides of a triangle and each other. So, perhaps the eight circles are arranged such that each is tangent to the next, and some are tangent to the sides of the triangle.

If I consider the case with eight circles of radius 34, they are arranged in a chain, each tangent to the next, and two of them are tangent to sides AB and BC. Then, for the smaller circles, 2024 circles of radius 1 are arranged similarly. So, maybe the figure is scaled down?

Wait, but triangles are similar if their inradius scales. So, perhaps the ratio of the inradius of ABC to the inradius of the small arrangement is the same as the ratio of the radii of the circles used?

But let me think more carefully.

First, let's model the problem. Let's say we have a triangle ABC, and along two sides, AB and BC, we have circles tangent to those sides and each other. So, for the big circles, there are eight of them, each with radius 34. And when we go to the small case, we have 2024 circles of radius 1. So, the number of circles is different, but the arrangement is similar.

I remember that in some problems, when you arrange circles tangent to two sides of a triangle and each other, the number of circles relates to the angles of the triangle. Specifically, the formula for the number of circles is related to the cotangent of half the angle at the vertex.

Wait, the formula I recall is that if you have a circle tangent to two sides of an angle, the radius is related to the distance from the vertex. Also, when you have multiple circles tangent to each other and the sides, the number of circles depends on the angle.

Wait, maybe it's the concept of "Archimedean circles" or something similar, but perhaps more generally, the number of circles that can be packed like that is related to the angle at the vertex.

So, if in the problem, two sides AB and BC have circles tangent to them and each other, and there are eight circles, perhaps the angle at B is such that the number of circles is eight. Similarly, in the small case, 2024 circles would correspond to the same angle but scaled.

So, perhaps the angle at B is given by something like 180 degrees divided by the number of circles. Wait, not exactly. Let's think about the formula.

I remember that for a circle tangent to two sides of an angle, the radius r is related to the distance from the vertex and the angle. The formula
