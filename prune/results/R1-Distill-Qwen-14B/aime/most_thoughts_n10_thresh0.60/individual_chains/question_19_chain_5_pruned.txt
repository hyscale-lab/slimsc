Okay, so I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. The given information is that the circumradius R is 13, the inradius r is 6, and IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, let me jot down the important details:

- Triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I.
- IA ⊥ OI.
- Circumradius R = 13.
- Inradius r = 6.
- Need to find AB · AC.

First, let me recall some properties and formulas related to triangle centers and radii.

I know that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula a/(2 sin A) = 2R. Wait, actually, the formula is a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C. So, sides can be expressed in terms of angles and R.

The inradius r is given by the formula r = (Area)/(semiperimeter), where the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. So, Area = r * s.

Also, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, OI, is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me check the formula. Oh yes, Euler's formula states that OI² = R(R - 2r). So, OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)).

Given R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI:

OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). That's helpful.

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at A. Wait, no, IA is one of the segments from incenter to vertex A, and OI is the segment from incenter to circumradius.

Wait, no, O is the circumcenter, so OI is a line from O to I. IA is the line from I to A, which is one of the inradius lines. So, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the inradius segment IA is perpendicular to the segment OI.

So, in other words, at point I
