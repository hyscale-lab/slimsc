Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. The point is called the incenter, I think, which is similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance should be equal for all faces, and it's given in a specific form. Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the volume and the surface area, but I need to recall the exact formula.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

It seems like the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, which suggests it's a kind of 'balanced' tetrahedron. Maybe it's isohedral or something? Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here. But the opposite edges being equal might have some symmetrical properties we can exploit.

Since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box or something? That might help in finding the volume or other properties.

I remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a disphenoid. Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So ABCD is a disphenoid because AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. That’s a useful piece of information because disphenoids have some nice properties, like being isohedral in terms of their faces, but not necessarily regular.

Disphenoids have four congruent triangular faces if they are regular, but in this case, since the edges are different lengths, the faces might not be congruent. Wait, no, let me check: each face is a triangle with edges √41, √80, and √89? Because each face has one edge from each pair. Hmm, no, wait, each face is a triangle with edges from three different pairs.

Wait, no, each face is a triangle, but each face will have one edge from AB, one from AC, and one from BC, for example. Let me think: no, actually, each face is a triangle formed by three edges. Since edges AB, AC, BC are all different, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89?

Wait, no, hold on. Let's list all the faces:

Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC → √41, √89, √80
Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD → √41, √8
