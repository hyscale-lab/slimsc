Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the problem says Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen ones.

The question is about finding the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so I think this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize.

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, that means she must have all four numbers matching. So, winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize because if she has all four, she definitely has at least two. Therefore, A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B), and then take their ratio.

Let me figure out what P(A) is. P(A) is the probability that all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen four. Since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers from 10, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4). And the number of favorable outcomes is 1, because there's only one set of four numbers that matches her four. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, let me compute that. C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, I need to compute P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. That can be computed as 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two numbers matching. So, the probability of having 0 or 1 matches.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the probability of at least two by adding the probabilities of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four matches.

Let me try both approaches and see which is easier.

First, let's try the direct method: sum the probabilities of exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 matches.

So, P(B) = P(exactly 2) + P(exactly 3) + P(exactly 4).

To compute each of these, I can use the hypergeometric probability formula, which is:

P(k) = [C(K, k) * C(N -
