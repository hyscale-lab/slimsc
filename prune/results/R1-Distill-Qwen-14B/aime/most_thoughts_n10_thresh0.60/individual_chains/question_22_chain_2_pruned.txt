Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the hexagon. It's convex and equilateral, so all sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel, which suggests it might be similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in certain directions. But since it's convex, all internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. I'm not entirely sure how these extensions form the triangle, but I think each side of the triangle is formed by extending one of these sides until they meet.

Wait, since opposite sides are parallel, extending AB and ED (if that's the opposite side) would be parallel, but maybe that's not directly involved. Alternatively, maybe the triangle is formed by three non-adjacent sides being extended. Let me think.

In a convex hexagon, each side can be extended beyond its endpoints, and opposite sides being parallel could mean that the extensions will meet at some point, forming a triangle. So, perhaps each pair of opposite sides' extensions intersect at a vertex of this triangle.

Let me try to model this. Let me denote the hexagon as ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA as sides. Since it's equilateral, each side has the same length, say 's'. Also, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

So, if I extend AB and DE, since they are parallel, they won't meet unless they are extended in the same direction. But wait, if opposite sides are extended, perhaps the extensions of AB, CD, and EF meet? Because AB is opposite to DE, CD is opposite to FA, and EF is opposite to BC.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is formed by the intersection points of AB extended with CD extended, CD extended with EF extended, and EF extended with AB extended.

But AB is parallel to DE, so if I extend AB beyond B and DE beyond E, they won't meet. Similarly, maybe the other
