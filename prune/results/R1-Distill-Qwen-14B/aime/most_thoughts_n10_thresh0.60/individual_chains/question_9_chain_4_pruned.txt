Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. It says that there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down what's given. So, two equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms have some properties that might help here. Let me recall them. One key property is that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). Also, log_b(a) = (ln a)/(ln b), where ln is the natural logarithm. Maybe I can use that to convert the logs into a common base or something.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. So, log_x(y) = 10/x.

Wait, log_x(y) is the exponent you raise x to get y. So, if log_x(y) = k, then x^k = y. So, in this case, x^(10/x) = y.

Alright, so y = x^(10/x). That's equation (3).

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, applying the power rule: 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, log_y(x) = 10/(4y) = 5/(2y).

But log_y(x) is the exponent you raise y to get x. So, y^(5/(2y)) = x.

So, x = y^(5/(2y)). That's equation (4).

Wait, so from equation (3), y is expressed in terms of x, and equation (4) expresses x in terms of y. So, perhaps I can substitute one into the other. Let's try that.

From equation (3): y = x^(10/x). Plugging this into equation (4):

x = [x^(10/x)]^(5/(2y)).

Wait, but y is x^(10/x), so let's substitute that in.

So, y = x^(10/x)
