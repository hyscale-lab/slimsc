Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first because without a clear picture, it's going to be tough to solve. 

Alright, the problem says rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Weâ€™re given BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. First, I know that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So rectangle ABCD has sides AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on the same straight line. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let's consider rectangle ABCD. Let's label the rectangle with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, AB is the base, BC is the height, CD is the top, and DA is the left side.

Now, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E and F must lie somewhere on a line that also includes D and C. Wait, but D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD. So, the line DC is actually the top side of rectangle ABCD, right? Because ABCD is a rectangle, DC is equal to AB, which is 107, so DC is 107 units long.

But wait, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E and F are on the same line as D and C. So, does that mean E and F lie on the line DC? Hmm, that makes sense because DC is a straight line, and if E and F are on that line, then D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line DC is where E and F are placed.

Wait, but then EFGH is another rectangle. If F is on DC, and E is also on DC, then where are the other points of EFGH? Let me think. Since EFGH is a rectangle, EF is one side, FG is another, GH is opposite to EF, and HE is opposite to FG.

So, EF is given as 184, and FG is 17. So, EF is a horizontal side (if DC is horizontal), or vertical? Wait, not necessarily, because in the problem, it's not specified which sides are horizontal or vertical. Hmm, maybe I should define the coordinate system to make things clearer.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's place point D at the origin (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB = 107, BC = 16, then
