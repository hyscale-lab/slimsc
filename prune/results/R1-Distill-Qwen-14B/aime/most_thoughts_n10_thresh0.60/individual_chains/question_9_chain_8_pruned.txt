Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product of two numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The problem says that the logarithm of y to the power of x with base x is 10, and the logarithm of x to the power of 4y with base y is also 10. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.

So, the equations are:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but I also recall some properties that might help. Let me think about the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a), I can rewrite this equation.

Applying that, equation 1 becomes:
x * log_x(y) = 10

Similarly, for equation 2: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes:
4y * log_y(x) = 10

Now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay, I need to find a way to relate these two equations. I know that log_b(a) is the reciprocal of log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A, which would make log_y(x) equal to 1/A. That might make the equations easier to handle.

So, let's let A = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) = 1/A.

Substituting these into the equations:

1. x * A = 10
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

Now I have:

Equation 1: x * A = 10

Equation 2: (4y) / A = 10

Hmm, maybe I can solve for x and y in terms of A. Let's see.

From equation 1: x = 10 / A

From equation 2: 4y = 10A => y = (10A) / 4 = (5A)/2

So now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of A:

x = 10 / A

y = (5A) / 2

But I also know that A = log_x(y). Since x and y are expressed in terms of A, maybe I can substitute them back into this definition to solve for A.

So, A = log_x(y) = log_{10/A} (5A/2)

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try to express this logarithm in terms of A. Logarithms can be tricky, but I can use the change of base formula to rewrite this.

The change of base formula says that log_b(a) = ln(a) / ln(b) or log_b(a) = log_c(a) / log_c(b) for any positive c â‰  1.

So, log_{10/A} (5A/2) can be rewritten using base 10 or natural logs, but maybe I'll just use the change of base formula with base 10.

Alternatively, maybe express A as a logarithm expression. Let me think.

Alternatively, since A = log_x(y), which is log_{10/A} (5A/2), perhaps I can express this as:

A = (ln(5A/2)) / ln(10/A)

But that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can write in terms of exponents.

Wait, let's think about it differently. Since A = log_x(y), that means x^A = y.

But from earlier, I have x = 10/A and y = (5A)/2.

So plugging x into x^A = y:

(10/A)^A = (5A)/2

Hmm, that gives me an equation in terms of A:

(10/A)^A = (5A)/2

This looks complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier.

Taking ln of both sides:

ln( (10/A)^A ) = ln( (5A)/2 )

Using the power rule for logarithms on the left side:

A * ln(10/A) = ln(5A/2)

Let me expand the left side:

A * (ln(10) - ln(A)) = ln(5A/2)

Which simplifies to:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Wait, because ln(5A/2
