Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when N is divided by 1000, we get a quotient Q and a remainder R. We need to find Q + R.

Alright, so first, N is a four-digit number. The maximum four-digit number is 9999, but N must satisfy this special property. So N is the largest such number where changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

Hmm. So, for example, if N is ABCD, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which must also be divisible by 7. The same goes for changing C to 1 (AB1D) and D to 1 (ABC1). All these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we need the greatest such number, perhaps we can start from 9999 and check downwards, but that might take too long. Instead, maybe we can find some mathematical conditions that N must satisfy.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are its digits, with a from 1 to 9 and b, c, d from 0 to 9.

Now, when we change each digit to 1, we get four new numbers:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7. Let me write these as equations:

1. (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. (1000a + 100 + 10c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. (1000a + 100b + 10 + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. (1000a + 100b + 10c + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 modulo 7. Let me compute each expression modulo 7.

First, let me find the values of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142 = 994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 divided by 7: 7*14=98, remainder 2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 3. So 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite each of the four expressions modulo 7.

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7  -- Equation 1
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7  -- Equation 2
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7  -- Equation 3
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7  -- Equation 4

Hmm, okay. So, we have four equations with variables a, b, c, d (digits). We need to find the largest N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d such that all four equations hold.

Since we're looking for the largest N, we should start with a=9, and then try the largest possible b, c, d.

But maybe it's easier to subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let me see.

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation1:

(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) = 6a + 2 + 3c + d -6 -2b -3c -d = 6a -2b -4 ≡ 0 mod7

So, 6a - 2b -4 ≡0 mod7 --> 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as 3a - b ≡ 2 mod7, by dividing both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed).

So, 3a - b ≡ 2 mod7. Let's keep this as Equation 5.

Similarly, subtract Equation 1 from Equation3:

Equation3 - Equation1:

(6a + 2b +3 + d) - (6 + 2b +3c + d) =6a +2b +3 +d -6 -2b -3c -d =6a -3c -3 ≡0 mod7

So, 6a -3c -3 ≡0 mod7 --> 2a - c -1 ≡0 mod7 (since 6 ≡6, 3 ≡3, so 6a -3c ≡3(2a -c), and 3(2a -c) -3 ≡0 --> 3(2a -c -1)≡0 mod7. Since 3 and 7 are coprime, we can divide both sides by 3, getting 2a -c -1 ≡0 mod7. So, 2a - c ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation6.

Next, subtract Equation1 from Equation4:

Equation4 - Equation1:

(6a +2b +3c +1) - (6 +2b +3c +d) =6a +2b +3c +1 -6 -2b -3c -d =6a -d -5 ≡0 mod7

So, 6a -d -5 ≡0 mod7 --> 6a -d ≡5 mod7. Let's call this Equation7.

So, now we have:

Equation5: 3a - b ≡2 mod7

Equation6: 2a - c ≡1 mod7

Equation7:6a - d ≡5 mod7

Plus Equation1: 6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7

So, now, perhaps we can express b, c, d in terms of a.

From Equation5: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

From Equation6: c≡2a -1 mod7.

From Equation7: d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So, we can write:

b = (3a -2) mod7

c = (2a -1) mod7

d = (6a -5) mod7

Since b, c, d are digits (0-9), we can find their possible values based on a.

But since a is from 1-9, let's consider a from 9 downwards (since we need the largest N), and see if we can find b, c, d as digits (0-9) that satisfy these congruencies, and also satisfy Equation1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to do the following:

Express b, c, d as:

b = 7k1 + (3a -2 mod7), but since b must be 0-9, we can compute it as:

b = (3a -2) mod7. But it could be negative, so we need to adjust.

Similarly for c and d.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute for each a from 9 down to 1, compute b, c, d based on congruences and check whether Equation1 is satisfied.

But let me think: Since a is from 1 to9, let's compute for a=9.

a=9:

Equation5: b ≡3*9 -2=27-2=25 mod7. 25 divided by7 is 3*7=21, remainder4. So, b ≡4 mod7. So possible b=4 or 11, but b is a digit, so b=4 or 11 is invalid, so b=4.

Wait, but wait, 25 mod7: 7*3=21, 25-21=4, so yes, 25≡4 mod7. So b=4 +7k, but since b must be ≤9, possible values for b are 4 and 11, but 11 is invalid, so b=4.

Similarly, c: Equation6: c=2a -1 mod7. a=9: 2*9=18-1=17 mod7. 17/7=2*7=14, remainder3.
