Okay, so I’ve got this problem about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999, and when I read it top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. Hmm, a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Each cell will have a single digit (0-9). Let me label the cells as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So the first row is a, b, c, and the second row is d, e, f. When read left to right, the top row forms a three-digit number, say abc, and the bottom row forms def. So the sum of these two numbers should be 999.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is a followed by d, so the number is ad. The second column is be, and the third is cf. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

Let me write down the equations based on this.

First, the sum of the two three-digit numbers:

abc + def = 999.

But wait, abc is actually 100a + 10b + c, and def is 100d + 10e + f. So,

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Let me rearrange this:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Hmm, that's one equation.

Next, the sum of the three two-digit numbers:

ad + be + cf = 99.

Here, ad is 10a + d, be is 10b + e, and cf is 10c + f. So,

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Which simplifies to:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So now I have two equations:

1) 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

2) 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote some variables to make this easier. Maybe let S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f.

So equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation 2: Let’s express it in terms of the same variables.

Wait, equation 2 is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote T1 = a + b + c, and T2 = d + e + f.

So equation 2 is 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

But from equation 1, I can express T1 and T2 in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, let me compute T1 and T2.

T1 = a + b + c.

T2 = d + e + f.

But S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f.

So adding S1, S2, S3: S1 + S2 + S3 = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = T1 + T2.

So, S1 + S2 + S3 = T1 + T2.

But from equation 2, 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

Hmm, I have two equations:

1) 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

2) 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

And we know that S1 + S2 + S3 = T1 + T2. Let's denote this as equation 3.

So, perhaps I can express T1 and T2 in terms of S1, S2, S3.

From equation 3: T1 + T2 = S1 + S2 + S3.

From equation 2: 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

Let me subtract equation 3 multiplied by 1 from equation 2:

(10*T1 + T2) - (T1 + T2) = 99 - (S1 + S2 + S3).

Which gives 9*T1 = 99 - (S1 + S2 + S3).

So,

T1 = (99 - (S1 + S2 + S3)) / 9.

Hmm, that might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express T1 and T2 in terms of each other.

From equation 2: T2 = 99 - 10*T1.

Substitute into equation 3:

T1 + (99 - 10*T1) = S1 + S2 + S3.

Simplify:

T1 + 99 - 10*T1 = S1 + S2 + S3.

Which becomes:

-9*T1 + 99 = S1 + S2 + S3.

So,

S1 + S2 + S3 = -9*T1 + 99.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet.

Let me go back to equation 1:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

I can write this as:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Let me think about the possible values for S1, S2, S3.

Each S is the sum of two digits. So, S1 can be from 0 (if a=0 and d=0) up to 9+9=18. Similarly, S2 and S3 can be 0 to 18.

But in equation 1, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Let me see the possible values for S1, S2, S3 such that 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Let me note that 999 is a three-digit number. So 100*S1 must be less than or equal to 999. So S1 must be 9, because 100*9=900, which is less than 999. If S1 were 10, 100*10=1000 which is more than 999. So S1 must be 9.

Wait, let me confirm that. 100*S1 must be less than or equal to 999, so S1 can be at most 9 because 100*9=900, and 100*10=1000 which is too big. So S1 must be 9.

So S1 = 9.

Then equation 1 becomes:

100*9 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Which is 900 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

So,

10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Hmm, okay, so now equation 1 reduces to:

10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Which is similar to equation 2, which is 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

Wait, that's interesting. So both equations have the same form.

So equation 1 after substituting S1=9: 10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Equation 2: 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

So both equations now are 10X + Y = 99, where X is S2 and Y is S3 for equation 1, and X is T1 and Y is T2 for equation 2.

So let's first solve equation 1 for S2 and S3.

Equation 1: 10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Since S2 and S3 are sums of two digits, each can be from 0 to 18.

So let's find all possible (S2, S3
