Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, since \( |z| = 4 \), I can represent \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier because working with exponentials can sometimes simplify multiplicative expressions.

Let me rewrite \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( 1/z \) would be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because the magnitude becomes reciprocal and the angle becomes negative.

So substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplify each term:

First term: \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

So the entire expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Now, since \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \), I can substitute these into the expression.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \):

Multiply \( (300 + 468i) \) with \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \):

Using distributive property:

\( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:

\( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Imaginary: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \)

So, \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} = [300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta] + i[300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta] \)

Next, compute \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \):

Multiply \( (24 + 36i) \) with \( \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \):

\( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:

\( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Imaginary: \( -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \)

So, \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} = [24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta] + i[-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta] \)

Now, add the two results together:

Real parts:

\( [300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta] + [24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta] \)

Imaginary parts:

\( [300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta] + [-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta] \)

Let me compute the real part first:

Combine like terms:

\( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)

Which is:

\( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Similarly, the imaginary part:

\( (300 -24)\sin\theta + (468 +36)\cos\theta \)

Which is:

\( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)

So, the entire expression is:

\( [324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta] + i[276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta] \)

But we're only interested in the real part. So, the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Our goal is to maximize this real part. Let me denote this real part as \( R \):

\( R = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

To find the maximum of \( R \), I can think of this as a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be expressed as a single sinusoidal function.

Recall that \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta = C\cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \phi \) is some phase shift.

Wait, in our case, it's \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \), but in our case, it's \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So, \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \).

So, the amplitude \( C \) will be \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \( 324^2 \):

\( 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104,976.

Next, compute \( 432^2 \):

\( 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000 + 25600 = 185600; 185600 +1024 = 186,624.

So, \( C = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} \).

Compute \( \sqrt{291600} \). Well, 540^2 is 291600 because 54^2 is 2916, so 540^2 is 291600. So, \( C = 540 \).

So, the maximum value of \( R = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) is the amplitude \( C = 540 \).

Wait, let me double-check that. The maximum of \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) is indeed \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). So, yes, the maximum real part is 540.

But wait, I'm being asked for the largest possible real part. So, is that the answer? 540?

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't skip a step. Because R is the real part, so it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, and its maximum is 540. So, the maximum real part of the entire expression is 540.

Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider writing R as a single cosine function with some phase shift, which would have a maximum value equal to its amplitude.

Yes, that's correct. So, the maximum value of R is indeed 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.


The largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
