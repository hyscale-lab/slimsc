Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I'm supposed to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, then square it and express it as a fraction p/q, and finally find p + q. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me recall some basics. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, which I'll call x, y, and z. The surface area S of a rectangular box is given by the formula S = 2(xy + yz + xz). The volume V is given by V = xyz.

In this problem, the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. So, I can write:
2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + xz = 27
and
xyz = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's diameter must be equal to the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to enclose the entire box, so the diagonal of the box will be the diameter of the sphere. Therefore, the radius r is half of that diagonal.

The space diagonal d of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, r = d / 2, which means r² = (x² + y² + z²) / 4.

My goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z². So, I need to find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on the surface area and volume.

Hmm, this sounds like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers for this. Or maybe there's a smarter way since the variables are symmetric.

Let me set up the problem. I need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

Wait, but Lagrange multipliers with two constraints might be a bit complicated. Maybe I can find a way to reduce the number of variables or use some inequalities.

I remember that for optimization problems with symmetric functions, sometimes assuming variables are equal can help. However, in this case, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x² = 54 ⇒ x² = 9 ⇒ x = 3. Then the volume would be x³ = 27. But the volume here is given as 23, which is less than 27. So, the box isn't a cube. Therefore, x, y, z must be different.

Hmm, maybe I can express two variables in terms of the third. Let me assume that x, y, z are positive real numbers because they are dimensions of a box.

Let me denote S = xy + yz + zx = 27 and P = xyz = 23. I'm trying to minimize x² + y² + z².

I remember that for any real numbers, (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2S.

Since S is fixed at 27, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. Therefore, minimizing x² + y² + z² is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)^2, which is the same as minimizing x + y + z.

Wait, no. Because (x + y + z)^2 is x² + y² + z² + 2S. So, if I know S is fixed, then x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. So, to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize (x + y + z)^2, which is the same as minimizing x + y + z.

But wait, no. Because if x + y + z is minimized, then (x + y + z)^2 is also minimized, which would minimize x² + y² + z². So, I need to minimize x + y + z given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, but how do I minimize x + y + z given these constraints? I might need to use some inequalities or perhaps use substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the others and substitute into the equations. Let me try to express z in terms of x and y.

From the volume constraint, z = 23 / (xy). Then, substitute this into the surface area equation.

So, surface area equation: xy + yz + xz = 27.

Substituting z, we get: xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27.

Simplify: xy + (23)/(x) + (23)/(y) = 27.

Hmm, that's an equation in x
