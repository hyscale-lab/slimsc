Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC. Let me read the problem again and try to visualize it.

Eight circles of radius 34 are sequentially tangent. So, I imagine a chain of eight circles, each touching the next one. Two of these circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of triangle ABC, respectively. Also, it's mentioned that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. Hmm, this probably means that the same configuration but scaled down, with many more circles. The inradius of ABC is to be found as a fraction m/n, and then I need to compute m + n.

Wait, so the setup is similar for both the large circles and the small ones. Let me think about the properties involved here. Since the circles are tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle, this sounds like an inradius problem with some tangent circles inside the triangle.

I remember that when circles are tangent to two sides of a triangle and each other, their centers lie along the angle bisector. So, in this case, the two circles tangent to AB and BC must lie near vertex B, right? But wait, the problem says two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC, respectively. So, maybe they are positioned such that one is near AB and the other near BC, each tangent to one side and the next circle in the chain.

Wait, but the circles are arranged sequentially, so they form a kind of chain inside the triangle. So,
