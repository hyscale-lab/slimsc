Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to break it down.

First, I know that a regular octagon has 8 sides, so it has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256.

Now, the problem is about the probability that after some rotation of the octagon, all the blue vertices move to positions where there were originally red vertices. So, essentially, after rotation, every blue vertex should align with a red one from the original coloring.

Wait, so this rotation would effectively swap the colors in a way. Like, if you have some symmetry in the coloring, you can rotate it so that blue becomes red and vice versa.

I think this relates to group theory, specifically to group actions and Burnside's lemma. Burnside's lemma is useful for counting the number of orbits, which might be helpful here. But I'm not entirely sure how to apply it directly.

Let me think differently. For a given coloring, when can we rotate it such that blue becomes red? That would mean that the coloring is symmetric in some way. Maybe the coloring has a certain periodicity or repetition that allows such a rotation.

Wait, perhaps the coloring must be fixed under a rotation by 180 degrees, or something like that? No, not necessarily. Maybe the coloring needs to have some rotational symmetry that allows the blue and red vertices to swap places.

Alternatively, perhaps the coloring must be such that the blue vertices form a pattern that is a rotation of the red vertices. So, there exists some rotation that maps the blue set to the red set.

Another way to think about it: the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since in any coloring, the number of blue vertices can vary, but for such a rotation to exist, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. Because if you rotate the blue set to the red set, they must have the same size.

So, that implies that the number of blue vertices must be 4, because in an octagon with 8 vertices, half are blue, half are red
