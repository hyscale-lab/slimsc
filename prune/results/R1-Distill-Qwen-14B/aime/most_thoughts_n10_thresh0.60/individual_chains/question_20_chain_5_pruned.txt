Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips. I need to place some of them on a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Also, the placement should be such that if I add any more chips, it would violate these conditions. I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let's break it down. Each row must have chips of the same color, either all white or all black. Similarly, each column must be all white or all black. So, for each row, I can choose whether it's white or black, and same for each column.

Wait, but there's a catch. Because if I choose all rows to be white, then all columns must also be white, but that would mean putting white chips in every cell. But I only have 25 white chips, so that's not possible. So there must be some rows and columns that are white and some that are black.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each row can be either all white or all black. Similarly, each column can be either all white or all black. But these choices aren't independent because the intersection of a row and a column must satisfy both the row's color and the column's color. So, if a particular cell is at the intersection of a white row and a black column, what color does it have? That's a conflict because the row says white, but the column says black. So, that cell cannot have a chip. Or wait, the cell can have a chip only if the row and column agree on a color? Let me clarify.

Each cell can have a chip only if both the row and column are the same color. Otherwise, if the row is white and the column is black, or vice versa, that cell cannot have a chip because it would violate the condition that all chips in the same row and column have the same color. Wait, no, the condition is that all chips in the same row are same color, same for the column. So, if a row is white, all the chips in that row must be white. Similarly for the column. But if a cell is
