Okay, so I've got this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this.

First off, I'm assuming that each step on the grid can either be moving right or up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, to get from the start to the end, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because each path has to move exactly 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) moves in some order.

Now, the problem says the path changes direction exactly four times. Wait, direction changes happen when you switch from moving right to up or up to right. So, each time the direction changes, it's a switch between R and U. So, the number of direction changes is related to how many times the path switches between R and U.

Let me think: if a path has exactly four direction changes, that means it alternates between R and U four times. How does that translate into the number of segments of R's and U's?

Hmm. Let's say the path starts with R. Then, each direction change would switch it to U, then R, then U, and so on. So, each direction change adds a new segment. So, starting with R, four direction changes would mean the path has (4 + 1) = 5 segments. Because each direction change adds a new segment. Similarly, if it started with U, four direction changes would also result in 5 segments.

Wait a second, direction changes occur between the segments. So, the number of direction changes plus one gives the number of segments. So, four direction changes mean five segments. So, the path alternates between R and U segments five times.

But wait, the path must end at the upper right corner, which is after moving up. So, the last segment has to be an up move, right? Because to reach the end, you need to finish with an up move if you started with a right move, or a right move if you started with an up move. Hmm, no, that's not necessarily correct. Wait, the path must end after moving 8 right and 8 up, regardless of the order.

Wait, let's clarify.
