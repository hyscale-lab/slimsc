Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay, first, let me try to visualize the problem. I have two rectangles. Let me sketch this out mentally. So, rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Since BC is 16 and AB is 107, ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the length and BC is the width. So, AB = 107 is the length, BC = 16 is the height.

Then there's another rectangle EFGH. Given that FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is the length of the rectangle, and FG is the height. So, EF = 184, FG = 17.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means all four points lie on a straight line. So D, E, C, F are on a straight line in that order? Or maybe E is somewhere else? Hmm, I need to think about the arrangement.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle. So, maybe the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Let's try to arrange the rectangles. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and ABCD is a rectangle, point D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, and point C is the opposite corner. So, in rectangle ABCD, the corners are A, B, C, D in order. So, points D and C are adjacent corners. So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, then E and F must lie on the extension of the line DC.

Wait, but rectangles EFGH and ABCD... So, EFGH is another rectangle. Let me think about their positions.

Let me try to imagine rectangle ABCD. Let's say it's placed such that AB is horizontal, so A is at the bottom-left, B is at the bottom-right, C is at the top-right, D is at the top-left. So, points D and C are adjacent. Then, EFGH is another rectangle such that points D, E, C, F are on a straight line. So, E must be to the left of D, and F must be to the right of C on the same line DC.

Wait, but in that case, the line DC is the top side of rectangle ABCD. So, if E is to the left of D and F is to the right of C on line DC, then EFGH is another rectangle attached somehow.

But also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, A is at the bottom-left corner of ABCD, D is the top-left, H is a corner of EFGH, and G is another corner.

Hmm, perhaps EFGH is such that points E and F are on the line DC, but the rectangle EFGH is built off that line.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. So, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, line DEF C is a straight line. So, E is a point on the line DC, beyond D, and F is beyond C.

But in that case, rectangle EFGH has E and F as two of its corners. So, EFGH is a rectangle, with E and F on line DC, and G and H as the other two corners.

Wait, but H is a point connected to G, which is connected to F and E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps EFGH is such that EF is a side, and E and F are on line DC.

Wait, but in rectangle EFGH, EF is a side, so EF is 184, and FG is 17. So, EF is the length, FG is the height.

Wait, so EF is 184 units long, which is quite a bit longer than BC which is 16. Hmm.

So, if E and F are on line DC, and EF is 184, then the line DC is longer than EF. But DC is the side of rectangle ABCD, which is equal to AB = 107. Wait, that can't be, because DC is 107, but EF is 184. So, they can't both be on the same line DC, because DC is only 107.
