Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. It says:

"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Hmm, so I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared for some n, and then find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Alright, let me break this down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That means n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that for primes, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p implies that n² ≡ sqrt(-1) mod p or something like that. Wait, but maybe I should think about the order of n modulo p.

Wait, I think Fermat's little theorem tells us that n^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p if n is not divisible by p. So perhaps the order of n modulo p divides (p-1). Also, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then squaring both sides gives n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p divides 8, but doesn't divide 4 because n⁴ ≡ -1 ≠ 1. So the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 divides (p-1), meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, primes p ≡ 1 mod 8 are candidates. But we're looking for the smallest such p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n. So maybe the primes p ≡1 mod 8, and then we need to check whether n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² is possible.

Wait, I think that for primes p where p ≡1 mod 8, the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p has solutions, but whether the solutions can be lifted to mod p² is another question.

I remember Hensel's lemma, which allows lifting solutions from mod p to mod p² under certain conditions. So, if the derivative of f(x) = x² + 1 is non-zero mod p, then solutions mod p can be lifted uniquely to mod p². The derivative f’(x) = 2x. So, for the solution x ≡ a mod p, if 2a ≢ 0 mod p, which is true as long as a ≢ 0 mod p. Since a is a solution to x² ≡ -1 mod p, a can’t be zero, so 2a is not zero mod p. So Hensel's lemma says that solutions mod p lift uniquely to mod p².

Wait, but in this problem, we have n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So if x² ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, then perhaps x⁴ ≡ (x²)^2 ≡
