Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of two real numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The given conditions are that the logarithm of y^x with base x is 10, and the logarithm of x^{4y} with base y is also 10. Hmm, let me try to write that down.

So, the problem says:
log_x(y^x) = 10
and
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Alright, I remember that logarithms can be manipulated using some properties. Let me recall them. One of the key logarithm properties is that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So I can apply that here.

Starting with the first equation:
log_x(y^x) = 10
Using the property, that becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, let me write that down correctly. So, log_x(y^x) is equal to x * log_x(y), right? And that equals 10. So equation one is:
x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is:
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
Which would be 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So equation two is:
4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, okay. Now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I need to solve for x and y. But these equations involve logarithms with different bases. Maybe I can express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other.

I remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as some variable to make it easier. Let me set a variable, say, k = log_y(x). Then, log_x(y) would be 1/k.

So substituting into the first equation:
x * (1/k) = 10 => x = 10k.

And the second equation is:
4y * k = 10 => 4y = 10/k => y = (10)/(4k) = (5)/(2k).

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k:
x = 10k
y = 5/(2k)

Hmm, but I also know that k is log_y(x). Let me write that definition down:
k = log_y(x) = log_y(10k) [since x is 10k]

But wait, since y = 5/(2k), I can substitute that into the logarithm as well.

So, k = log_{5/(2k)}(10k)

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can express this logarithm in terms of natural logarithms or something else to make it solvable.

I know that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). So, let's rewrite the equation:

k = ln(10k) / ln(5/(2k))

Let me compute the denominator:

ln(5/(2k)) = ln(5) - ln(2k) = ln(5) - (ln(2) + ln(k)).

So, putting it back:

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(k)]

Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can simplify the numerator and denominator further.

Wait, the numerator is ln(10k) = ln(10) + ln(k).

So, substituting that in:

k = [ln(10) + ln(k)] / [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(k)]

Let me rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by the denominator:

k * [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(k
