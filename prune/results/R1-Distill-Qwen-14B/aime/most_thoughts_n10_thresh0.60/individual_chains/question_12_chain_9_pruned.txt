Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are satisfied. First, the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right (so the top row and the bottom row) should equal 999. Second, the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom (so each column as a number) should equal 99. 

Let me start by visualizing the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so it has two rows and three columns. Let me denote the grid as follows:

Top row: A B C
Bottom row: D E F

So, the numbers from the top row are ABC (which is 100*A + 10*B + C) and DEF (which is 100*D + 10*E + F). Their sum should be 999. 

The numbers from the columns are AD, BE, and CF. So, AD is 10*A + D, BE is 10*B + E, and CF is 10*C + F. Their sum should be 99.

So, let me write down the equations:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Breaking down the first equation, ABC is 100A + 10B + C, and DEF is 100D + 10E + F. So,

(100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999

Which simplifies to:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

Similarly, the second equation is:

(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99

Let me denote each column's sum:

AD = 10A + D = x
BE = 10B + E = y
CF = 10C + F = z

So, x + y + z = 99.

Hmm, perhaps I can express A, B, C in terms of x, y, z.

Wait, x = 10A + D → A = (x - D)/10. But D is the bottom digit of the first column, so D can be 0-9. Wait, but A is a digit, so (x - D) must be divisible by 10.

Similarly for y and z:

y = 10B + E → B = (y - E)/10
z = 10C + F → C = (z - F)/10

But since A, B, C are digits (0-9), (x - D) must be between 0 and 90, because A can be 0-9, so x = 10A + D. Similarly for y and z.

Wait, but x is 10A + D, so x must be a two-digit number where the tens digit is A and the units digit is D. Similarly y and z are two-digit numbers with tens digits B and C respectively.

Since x, y, z are two-digit numbers, their sum is 99. So, x + y + z = 99, where each of x, y, z is between 0 and 99 (since they are two-digit numbers, but leading zeros are allowed, so x can be 00, which is 0, up to 99).

Wait, but if x is 00, then A would be 0 and D would be 0. Similarly, if x is 01, then A would be 0 and D would be 1.

So, x, y, z can range from 0 to 99, integers. Their sum is 99.

So, we can model this as finding all triples (x, y, z) such that x + y + z = 99, where each x, y, z is between 0 and 99 inclusive. Then, for each such triple, we check if x, y, z can be split into digits A, D; B, E; C, F respectively. That is:

For each x, write x as 10A + D, where A and D are digits (0-9). Similarly for y and z.

But wait, for each x, since x can be from 0 to 99, A can be 0 to 9 (as x=10A + D, so A is floor(x/10), and D is x mod 10. Similarly for y and z
