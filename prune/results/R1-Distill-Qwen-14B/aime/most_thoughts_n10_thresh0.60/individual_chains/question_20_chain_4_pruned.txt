Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for their color. I need to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. 

The conditions given are:
1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, the setup requires that in every row, all the placed chips are either all white or all black. Similarly, every column must have all its chips (if any) of the same color. Moreover, the placement is maximal, meaning I can't add any more chips without breaking these conditions.

Hmm, okay. So, each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But since the grid is 5x5, each row and column being the same color imposes some constraints.

Wait, but if a row is all white, then each column that intersects this row must also be all white. Because if a column has a white chip in that row, all chips in that column must be white. But if that row is entirely white, then every column that has a chip in that row must be entirely white as well.

Wait, that seems like a key point. Let me think again. Suppose I decide a particular row is all white. Then, for every cell in that row that I place a white chip, the corresponding column must also be all white. But if I don't place any chips in that row, then the columns can be either white or black or empty, right?

So, perhaps, each row and each column can independently decide to be white, black, or empty, but with the caveat that if a row is white, then all the columns that have any chips in that row must also be white. Similarly, if a column is white, then all the rows that have any chips in that column must also be white.

Wait, but that might not necessarily lead to a simple case. Maybe it's better to model this as a grid where each row
