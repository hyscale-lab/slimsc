Okay, so I've got this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but let me break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the equations as they are given.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Both logs equal 10, so maybe I can set them equal to each other or find a way to relate x and y.

I remember that log_b(a) = c can be rewritten as b^c = a. So, maybe I can rewrite both equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Converting this to exponential form would mean x^10 = y^x. Okay, so x raised to the 10th power equals y raised to the x. That's one equation.

Now the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, converting this gives y^10 = x^{4y}. So y raised to the 10th power equals x raised to the 4y.

So now I have two equations:
1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, these look a bit complicated, but maybe I can take the same base on both sides or find a way to relate x and y.

Let me take the first equation: x^10 = y^x. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier. So, ln(x^10) = ln(y^x). Using logarithm properties, this becomes 10 ln x = x ln y. So 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}. Taking natural logs of both sides, ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y}). Which simplifies to 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So now I have two equations:
1. 10 ln x = x ln y
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, these might be more manageable. Let me denote equation 1 as Eq1 and equation 2 as Eq2.

So, Eq1: 10 ln x = x ln y
Eq2: 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let me see. From Eq1, I can solve for ln y. Let's rearrange Eq1:

ln y = (10 ln x) / x

Similarly, from Eq2, I can solve for ln x:

ln x = (10 ln y) / (4y) = (5 ln y) / (2y)

Wait, so I have expressions for ln y and ln x in terms of each other. Maybe I can substitute one into the other.

From Eq1, ln y = (10 ln x)/x, and from Eq2, ln x = (5 ln y)/(2y). Let me substitute the expression for ln y from Eq1 into Eq2.

So, ln x = (5 / (2y)) * (10 ln x / x) = (50 ln x) / (2xy) = (25 ln x) / (xy)

Hmm, so ln x equals (25 ln x)/(x y). Let me write that:

ln x = (25 ln x)/(x y)

Hmm, assuming ln x is not zero. Since x > 1, ln x is positive, so ln x ≠ 0. Therefore, I can divide both sides by ln x.

So, 1 = 25/(x y)

Which implies that x y = 25.

Wait, that's the product I was supposed to find! So, is xy =25?

But let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let me go through the steps again.

From Eq1: ln y = (10 ln x)/x

From Eq2: ln x = (5 ln y)/(2y)

Substitute ln y from Eq1 into Eq2:

ln x = (5/(2y)) * (10 ln x / x) = (50 ln x)/(2 x y) = (25 ln x)/(x y)

So, ln x = (25 ln x)/(x y)

Divide both sides by ln x (since ln x ≠0):

1 = 25/(x y)

Multiply both sides by x y:

x y =25

So yes, that seems to check out. So the product xy is 25.

But wait, let me make sure that this is consistent with the original equations. Let me try to find x and y just to verify.

So, if x y = 25, then y = 25/x.

Let me plug that into Eq1: 10 ln x = x ln y.

Since y =25/x, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x.

So, Eq1 becomes 10 ln x =x (ln25 - ln x)

Similarly, Eq2: 10 ln y =4 y ln x.

Since y=25/x, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x, and so:

10 (ln25 - lnx ) =4*(25
