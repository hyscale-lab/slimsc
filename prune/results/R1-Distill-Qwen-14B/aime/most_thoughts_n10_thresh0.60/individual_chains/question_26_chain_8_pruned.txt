Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC. The problem gives me the lengths of the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The triangle is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C to the circle ω intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. I need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's try to visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, it's not a right-angled triangle because 5² + 9² is 25 + 81 = 106, which isn't 10²=100. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC? No, wait. If D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω, so yes, DB = DC. So, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Hmm, symmedian point perhaps?

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. The tangent at B and C meet at D. So, BD and CD are tangent to ω. So, by the property of tangents, BD = CD, because they're both tangents from D to ω. So, D is equidistant from B and C, meaning it lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC.

But BC is 9, so the perpendicular bisector would split BC into two segments of 4.5 each. So, D lies somewhere on that line.

But how does this help me find AP? Let's see. AD is drawn, and it intersects ω again at P. So, AP is a chord passing through A and D, but since D is outside the circle, AD is a secant.

Wait, I remember there's a power of a point theorem. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC², right? Because D is outside the circle, and DB and DC are tangent lengths. Also, since AD intersects ω at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω is also equal to DA * DP.

So, power of point D: DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, DA, and DP, I can relate them. But I don't know DA or DP yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for all points and compute it that way. That might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the
