Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have properties that might be useful here. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, I know that ω^13 = 1, and that the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, is that right? Because Φₙ(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) where k runs over the primitive nth roots of unity. Since 13 is prime, all the roots except 1 are primitive, so Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the cyclotomic polynomial might come into play here. The product given is over terms involving ω^k, so maybe I can find a clever way to relate this product to Φ₁₃(x) or something similar.

Looking at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write that down: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, can I factor this or rewrite it in a way that relates to cyclotomic polynomials?

Wait a second, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me consider treating ω^k as a variable, say z. Then the expression becomes z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots?

The quadratic equation z² - 2z + 2 = 0 has discriminant D = 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i. So, z² - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, substituting back, that means 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, each term in the product is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of these two factors. So, I can write the product as the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

Wait, that's interesting. So, the entire product is equal to [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

But I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) for k from 0 to 12 is x¹³ - 1, because each ω^k is a root of x¹³ - 1. So, in this case, if I set x = (1 + i), then
