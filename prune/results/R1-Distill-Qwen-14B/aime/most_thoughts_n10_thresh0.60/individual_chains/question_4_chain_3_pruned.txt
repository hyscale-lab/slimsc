Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that for these types of games, it's useful to find the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

In this case, the game ends when the last token is taken, so the player who takes the last token wins. So, if a player is faced with 1 token, they can take it and win. If they have 4 tokens, they can take all and win as well. But for other numbers, it depends on the possible moves.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). 

- If n = 1: the player can take 1 and win → W
- If n = 4: the player can take 4 and win → W
- For other n, the position is W if the player can move to an L position. Otherwise, it's L.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, a position is W if the current player can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position. So, if from position n, a player can move to L, then n is W. If all possible moves from n lead to W positions for the opponent, then n is L.

So, let's build this step by step.

Let me list n from 0 upwards and assign W or L to each.

But wait, n=0 is a special case—there are no tokens. So the player who is supposed to move when n=0 has already lost because they can't make a move. So n=0 is a losing position. 

So, let's start building:

n=0: L (losing position)
n=1: current player takes 1 and wins → W
n=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1, which is W for the opponent. But wait, if current player takes 1, opponent is at n=1 and can win. Alternatively, can current player take 4? No, because 4 > 2. So, the only move is to take 1, leading the opponent to W. So n=2 is L? Wait, wait, that can't be right. If the current player is at n=2, and they take 1, opponent is at n=1, which is W. That means opponent can win. So the current player can't force a win from n=2, so n=2 is L.

Wait, no. Wait, n=1 is W, so from n=2, if you take 1, opponent is at W, meaning opponent can win. So n=2 is L.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something,
