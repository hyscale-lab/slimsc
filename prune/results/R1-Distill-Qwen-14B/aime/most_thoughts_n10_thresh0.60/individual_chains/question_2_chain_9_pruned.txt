Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC squared, where C is a specific point on the line segment AB. Then, I have to express that as a fraction p/q and find p + q. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me parse the problem:

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher, at sqrt(3)/2 which is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment starting on the x-axis, ending on the y-axis, and has length 1. There's a unique point C on AB, not being A or B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB itself. I need to find OC squared.

Hmm. So, picture the first quadrant. O is the origin, A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The line segment AB connects these two points. The family F is all these unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant.

I think the key here is to find the point C on AB such that it's only on AB and none of the other segments in F. So, C is the only point on AB that isn't intersected by any other PQ segment from F. Maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope formed by the family F.

Wait, envelope... That rings a bell. In calculus, an envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. Maybe here, the segments PQ form an envelope, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C. So, C would be the point of tangency, meaning it's the only point where AB and the envelope meet. Therefore, C is the unique point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

So, I need to find the envelope of the family F. Each PQ segment is of unit length, starting on the x-axis at some point P = (p, 0) and ending on the y-axis at Q = (0, q), with the condition that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, p² + q² = 1.

The equation of the line PQ can be found. Let's see. The line passes through (p, 0) and (0, q). The slope would be (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. The equation is then y = (-q/p)x + q.

Alternatively, in intercept form, x/p + y/q = 1. That's another way to write it.

Since p² + q² = 1, we can parameterize p and q. Let me think: maybe using trigonometric functions because p and q lie on a unit circle. Let’s set p = cosθ and q = sinθ, because then p² + q² = cos²θ + sin²θ = 1. That seems convenient.

So, substituting p = cosθ and q = sinθ, the equation of PQ becomes x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1.

So, each segment PQ corresponds to a θ, and the family F is parameterized by θ.

Now, to find the envelope of this family, I can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves given by F(x, y, θ) = 0. The envelope satisfies both F(x, y, θ) = 0 and ∂F/∂θ = 0.

So, let's write F(x, y, θ) as x / cosθ + y / sinθ - 1 = 0.

Compute the partial derivative of F with respect to θ:

∂F/∂θ = ( -x sinθ / cos²θ ) + ( y cosθ / sin²θ ) = 0.

So, the envelope satisfies:

x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1,    (1)

and

( -x sinθ ) / cos²θ + ( y cosθ ) / sin²θ = 0.    (2)

Let me try to solve these two equations for x and y in terms of θ.

From equation (2):

(-x sinθ) / cos²θ + (y cosθ) / sin²θ = 0

Let me write it as:

x sinθ / cos²θ = y cosθ / sin²θ

So,

x / cos²θ = y / sin³θ

Thus,

x = y (cos²θ / sin³θ )

Let me denote this as equation (3).

Now, substitute x from equation (3) into equation (1):

( y (cos²θ / sin³θ ) ) / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1

Simplify each term:

First term: y cos²θ / sin³θ divided by cosθ is y cosθ / sin³θ.

Second term: y / sinθ.

So, the equation becomes:

y cosθ / sin³θ + y / sinθ = 1

Factor y:

y [ cosθ / sin³θ + 1 / sinθ ] = 1

Combine the terms inside the brackets:

cosθ / sin³θ + 1 / sinθ = [cosθ + sin²θ] / sin³θ

Because 1/sinθ is sin²θ / sin³θ.

So, numerator is cosθ + sin²θ.

Thus,

y [ (cosθ + sin²θ) / sin³θ ] = 1

Solve for y:

y = sin³θ / (cosθ + sin²θ )

Similarly, from equation (3):

x = y (cos²θ / sin³θ )

Substitute y:

x = [ sin³θ / (cosθ + sin²θ ) ] * ( cos²θ / sin³θ )

Simplify:

x = cos²θ / (cosθ + sin²θ )

So, we have expressions for x and y in terms of θ:

x = cos²θ / (cosθ + sin²θ )

y = sin³θ / (cosθ + sin²θ )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe we can simplify these expressions.

First, note that cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ.

So, x = (1 - sin²θ) / (cosθ + sin²θ )

Similarly, let's denote s = sinθ, c = cosθ.

So, x = (1 - s²) / (c + s² )

And y = s³ / (c + s² )

Perhaps I can express this in terms of s only, since c = sqrt(1 - s²), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe we can find a relation between x and y eliminating θ.

Let me try to find a relation between x and y.

From x:

x = (1 - s²) / (c + s² )

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1:

x = (1 - s²) / (c + s² )

Similarly, from y:

y = s³ / (c + s² )

So, perhaps we can write y in terms of x.

Let me denote D = c + s².

So, x = (1 - s²)/D,

y = s³ / D.

We can write:

x = (1 - s²)/D => D = (1 - s²)/x

Similarly, y = s³ / D => D = s³ / y

Therefore,

(1 - s²)/x = s³ / y

Cross-multiplying,

y(1 - s²) = x s³

So,

y - y s² = x s³

But I also know that s² + c² = 1, so c² = 1 - s².

Wait, but D = c + s².

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me square both x and y and see if I can find something.

Wait, maybe expressing t = tanθ. Let me set t = tanθ, so θ is in the first quadrant since P and Q are in the first quadrant.

So, t = tanθ => sinθ = t / sqrt(1 + t²), cosθ = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²).

Let me substitute s = sinθ = t / sqrt(1 + t²), c = cosθ = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²).

Then, compute x and y in terms of t.

x = cos²θ / (cosθ + sin²θ )

= [ (1 / (1 + t²)) ] / [ (1 / sqrt(1 + t²)) + (t² / (1 + t²)) ]

Simplify denominator:

= [1 / sqrt(1 + t²) ] + [ t² / (1 + t²) ]

= [ (1 + t²) / (1 + t²) ) / sqrt(1 + t²) + t² / (1 + t²) ]

Wait, maybe better to write it as:
