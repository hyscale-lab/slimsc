Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

"Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$."

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. I need to find the greatest such N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder), and then add Q and R together.

Alright, let's break it down. First, I need to figure out what N is. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with that property. So, I need to find the largest N where changing any single digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7.

Let me represent N as a four-digit number: let’s say N is ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, A is the thousands digit, B is hundreds, C is tens, D is units.

The condition is: if I change A to 1, B to 1, C to 1, or D to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.

Wait, so for example, if I change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which must be divisible by 7. Same for changing C to 1, which gives AB1D, and changing D to 1, which gives ABC1.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, I need to find the largest possible N, starting from 9999 and going downward, checking each number to see if it meets the condition. But that might take too long. I should find a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can set up equations based on the divisibility by 7.

Let me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, when I change each digit to 1, I get four new numbers:

1. Changing A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this N1.
2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Let's call this N2.
3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Let's call this N3.
4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me write these conditions out.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm. Let me compute each of these modulo 7. I know that 1000 mod 7 is equal to what? Let's compute:

7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, and 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's write each of the four conditions:

1. (6 mod 7) + (2 mod 7)*B + (3 mod 7)*C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
   So, 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. (6 mod 7)*A + (2 mod 7) + (3 mod 7)*C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
   So, 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. (6 mod 7)*A + (2 mod 7)*B + (3 mod 7) + D ≡ 0 mod 7.
   So, 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. (6 mod 7)*A + (2 mod 7)*B + (3 mod 7)*C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.
   So, 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, now we have four congruence equations:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod 7 → 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7 (since -6 mod7 is 1)
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7 → 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7 → 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7 → 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7

Hmm, that's four equations with four variables: A, B, C, D. But wait, actually, these equations all involve combinations of A, B,
