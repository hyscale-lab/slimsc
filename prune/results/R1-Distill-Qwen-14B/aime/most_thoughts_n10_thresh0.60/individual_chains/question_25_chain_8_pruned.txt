Okay, let's see. I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, so there are 900 residents total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which I guess is a given for everyone. Then, some own diamond rings, some own golf clubs, and some own garden spades. 

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- And everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's 900 for the candy hearts.

Additionally, there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four—so, the ones who have a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Hmm, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula when it comes to four sets. Let me think.

Wait, the problem gives me specific numbers about people owning exactly two or exactly three items. So maybe I can use that information to find the number of people owning all four.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|.

But in this problem, I don't have the individual pairwise or triple intersections, just the counts of people owning exactly two or exactly three things. Hmm, maybe I can approach it differently.

I think the key here is to consider that the total number of residents is 900, and each owns at least the candy hearts. So, the total number of "items" being considered is four, but candy hearts are universal.

Wait, but the problem states that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, for all the other items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), the ownership is separate, but everyone has the candy hearts.

Wait, so when we talk about a resident owning exactly two of these things, does that include the candy hearts or not? Because if someone owns exactly two things, it could be any two of the four, but since candy hearts are already given to everyone, does that affect the count?

Wait, no. Because the candy hearts are owned by everyone, so when considering the other three items, ownership of exactly two
