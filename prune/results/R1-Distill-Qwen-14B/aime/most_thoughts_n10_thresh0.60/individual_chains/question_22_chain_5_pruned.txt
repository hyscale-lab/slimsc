Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. An equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length. And since all opposite sides are parallel, it must be a special kind of hexagon, maybe something like a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all internal angles equal. Wait, but regular hexagons do have opposite sides parallel, so maybe this is similar but not regular because it's just equilateral, not necessarily equiangular.

But the problem says it's convex, so all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF... I'm trying to imagine how that would look. So if I extend AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, these extended lines should form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. Interesting.

I think this might be related to similar triangles or maybe using the properties of parallel lines. Since opposite sides are parallel, maybe there's some proportionality involved when we extend those sides.

Wait, in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal, the sides must be arranged such that each pair of opposite sides are not only parallel but also equal in length because it's equilateral. So each side is equal, and opposite sides are parallel. So this hexagon might be a translation of a smaller hexagon or something.

But how does extending AB, CD, and EF give us a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300? Let me think about how those extensions could form a triangle.

Maybe if I consider the concept of similar triangles. When you extend the sides of a polygon, the resulting triangle might be similar to the original triangle in some way, but scaled up or down. But in this case, the triangle isn't the original; it's formed by the extensions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use vectors or coordinate geometry to model this. Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and see if I can find relationships.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all
