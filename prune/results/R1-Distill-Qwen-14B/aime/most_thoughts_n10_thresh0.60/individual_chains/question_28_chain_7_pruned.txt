Alright, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are both √80, and BC and AD are both √89. There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. We need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, find m + n + p.

Hmm. Okay, so first, tetrahedrons can be tricky. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So I think we're being asked to find the inradius of this particular tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think the formula is similar to the 2D case in triangles. In a triangle, the inradius r is equal to the area A divided by the semiperimeter s: r = A / s. For a tetrahedron, I believe the formula is the volume V divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces, divided by 3. So, r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4), where Ai are the areas of the four faces.

So, the plan is: find the volume V of the tetrahedron, find the areas of each of the four faces, sum them up, and then compute 3V divided by that sum.

But wait, to calculate the volume of a tetrahedron, when all the edges are known, I think we can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That's a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths. The formula is:

V = √[ determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix ] / 288

The Cayley-Menger matrix for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is a 5x5 matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

The determinant of this matrix is proportional to the square of the volume.

Given that, let me list out all the edges:

AB = √41, so AB² = 41
AC = √80, so AC² = 80
AD = √89, so AD² = 89
BC = √89, so BC² = 89
BD = √80, so BD² = 80
CD = √41, so CD² = 41

So, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I get the Cayley-Menger matrix correct. The first row is 0, 1, 1, 1, 1. Then, the next rows are 1 followed by the squares of the edges. But I think the edges are ordered as AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. So, in the Cayley-Menger matrix, the first row after the initial is AB², AC², AD². Then the next row is BC², BD², CD², and so on?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the structure of the Cayley-Menger determinant. From what I remember, the Cayley-Menger matrix for points A, B, C, D is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and first column are all 1s except the (0,0) entry which is 0, and the other entries are the squares of the distances between the points.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Cayley-Menger matrix is symmetric, and the rows and columns correspond to the points. So for four points A, B, C, D, the matrix is 5x5 with the first row being [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], and the first column being [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T. The
