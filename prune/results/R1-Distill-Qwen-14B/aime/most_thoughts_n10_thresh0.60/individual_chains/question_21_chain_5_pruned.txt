Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Hmm, that's a term I haven't heard before, so I'll need to parse the definition carefully.

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63 (since 6*13 +3=81), and 6+3=9, which is the square root of 81.

Our goal is to find the least integer b (bâ‰¥2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Alright, so I need to figure out how to approach this. Let's break it down.

First, understanding what a two-digit number in base b means. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1*d2, where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d2 is the digit in the units place. So, the value of such a number in decimal is d1*b + d2.

Second, the sum of the digits d1 + d2 must equal sqrt(n). But n is equal to d1*b + d2, so sqrt(d1*b + d2) = d1 + d2.

So, to restate, for a number to be b-eautiful, it must satisfy:

sqrt(d1*b + d2) = d1 + d2.

And since n must be a two-digit number in base b, d1 can't be zero (since it's the leading digit) and must be less than b. Similarly, d2 must be less than b as well.

So, d1 is from 1 to b-1, and d2 is from 0 to b-1.

Let me write down the equation again:

sqrt(d1*b + d2) = d1 + d2.

If I square both sides to eliminate the square root:

d1*b + d2 = (d1 + d2)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side:

d1*b + d2 = d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2.

Let me rearrange this equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 - d1*b - d2 = 0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of d1 and d2. Maybe I can reorganize the terms to find a relationship between d1 and d2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this equation in a more manageable form. Let's see:

d1*b + d2 = (d1 + d2)^2
=> (d1 + d2)^2 - d1*b - d2 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach.

Let me denote S = d1 + d2. Then, the equation becomes:

d1*b + d2 = S^2.

But since S = d1 + d2, I can substitute:

d1*b + d2 = (d1 + d2)^2.

So,

d1*b = (d1 + d2)^2 - d2.

Factor the right-hand side:

(d1 + d2)^2 - d2 = d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 - d2.

Not sure if that helps. Maybe I can express everything in terms of d1 and S.

Wait, S = d1 + d2, so d2 = S - d1.

Substituting into the equation:

d1*b + (S - d1) = S^2.

Simplify:

d1*b + S - d1 = S^2
=> d1*(b - 1) + S = S^2.

Hmm, that seems helpful. Let's write that as:

d1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S.

So,

d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1).

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the right-hand side must evaluate to an integer. Also, S is the sum of d1 and d2, so S must be at least 1 (since d1 is at least 1) and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.

But since n is a two-digit number in base b, n = d1*b + d2, which must be less than b^2. So, sqrt(n) must be less than b, because n < b^2 implies sqrt(n) < b. Therefore, S must be less than b.

So, S can range from 1 to b - 1, inclusive. Because S = sqrt(n), which is less than b.

Wait, but n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 - 1. Therefore, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and b - 1 (since n < b^2). So S must be an integer in that interval.

Wait, but S is an integer because it's the sum of two digits
