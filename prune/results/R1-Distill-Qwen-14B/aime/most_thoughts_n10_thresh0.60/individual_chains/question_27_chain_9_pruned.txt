Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus T is made by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center. So, it's like a donut shape. Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. When T is inside S, they're tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when T is outside S, they're tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I'm supposed to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. A torus is a surface of revolution. So, when you revolve a circle around an external axis, you get a donut. The radius of the circle being revolved is 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent internally along a circle. And when the torus is outside, they are tangent externally along another circle.

I think I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, and then subtract them.

Wait, but how do I find these radii? I remember that when two surfaces are tangent, their centers must lie along the line connecting their centers, and the point of tangency is where they just touch each other. But since they're both surfaces of revolution, their intersection when tangent should be a circle.

Maybe I should model this in 3D coordinates. Let's assume the sphere S is centered at the origin (0,0,0). Then, the torus T can be placed such that its center is along the z-axis, maybe. Wait, but depending on whether it's inside or outside, the position might change.

Wait, no. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is entirely within the sphere except for a single circle where they touch. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along a circle.

But how do I find the points where they are tangent?

Let me try to think in terms of distance between centers. The sphere has center at (0,0,0), and the torus can be considered as having its center at (h,0,0), perhaps? Or maybe along the z-axis? Wait, no, the torus is symmetric around its own axis, so maybe the center of the generating circle is along the z-axis.

Wait, maybe better to think in cylindrical coordinates. The torus can be represented parametrically or with an equation. Let's recall: a torus can be given by (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z² = r
