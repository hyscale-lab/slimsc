Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, and z. Hmm, let me see. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴ y³ z²), which will be a fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:
log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, interesting. So if I let a = log₂(x), b = log₂(y), and c = log₂(z), then the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

Now I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can try solving this system.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I think I'll add all three equations together to see if that helps. Adding equation 1, 2, and 3:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Let me compute the left side:

a - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c = combine like terms.

a - a - a = -a.

-b + b - b = -b.

-c - c + c = -c.

So altogether: -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.

Wait, but on the right side, let's compute the sum:

1/2 is 6/12, 1/3 is 4/12, 1/4 is 3/12. So 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.

So, -a - b - c = 13/12.

But that's interesting. Now, if I can find a, b, c individually, then I can compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) as 4a + 3b + 2c.

Wait, let me make sure. Because x⁴ y³ z² would have exponents 4,3,2 on x,y,z, so log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z = 4a + 3b + 2c.

So we need to find 4a + 3b + 2c in absolute value.

But first, let's solve for a, b, c.

We have:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

And from adding all three, we have:

-a - b - c = 13/12 --> Equation 4.

So, equation 4: -a - b - c = 13/12.

Now, let's see if we can express other equations in terms of equation 4.

Looking back to equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2.

If I add equation 1 and equation 4:

(a - b - c) + (-a - b - c) = (1/2) + (13/12)

Simplify left side:

a - a cancels. -b - b = -2b. -c - c = -2c.

Right side: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 +13/12 =19/12.

So, -2b - 2c = 19/12.

Divide both sides by -2:

b + c = -19/(12*2) = -19/24.

So, equation 5: b + c = -19/24.

Similarly, let's take equation 2: -a + b - c =1/3.

Add equation 2 and equation 4:

(-a + b - c) + (-a - b - c) = (1/3) + (13/12)

Left side: -a -a = -2a. b - b = 0. -c - c = -2c.

So, -2a -2c = 1/3 +13/12.

Compute right side: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 +13/12=17/12.

So, -2a -2c =17/12.

Divide by -2:

a + c = -17/(12*2) = -17/24.

So equation 6: a + c = -17/24.

Similarly, let's take equation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.

Add equation 3 and equation 4:

(-a - b + c) + (-a - b - c) = (1/4) + (13/12)

Left side: -a -a = -2a. -b -b = -2b. c -c =0.

So, -2a -2b= 1/4 +13/12.

Right side: 1/4 is 3/12, so 3/12 +13/12=16/12=4/3.

So, -2a -2b=4/3.

Divide by -2:

a + b = -2/3.

So equation 7: a + b = -2/3.

Now, let me summarize the equations I have:

Equation 5: b + c = -19/24.

Equation 6: a + c = -17/24.

Equation 7: a + b = -2/3.

So now we have three equations with three variables. Let's try to solve for a, b, c.

First, from equation 7: a = -2/3 - b.

Let me substitute a into equation 6:

(-2/3 - b) + c = -17/24.

So, -2/3 - b + c = -17/24.

Let me rearrange:

c = -17/24 + 2/3 + b.

Compute 2/3 as 16/24. So,

c = (-17/24 +16/24) + b = (-1/24) + b.

So, equation 8: c = b -1/24.

Now, substitute c from equation 8 into equation 5:

b + (b -1/24)= -19/24.

Simplify:

2b -1/24 = -19/24.

Add 1/24 to both sides:

2b = (-19/24 +1/24)= (-18)/24 = -3/4.

So, 2b = -3/4 --> b = (-3/4)/2 = -3/8.

So, b = -3/8.

Now, from equation 7: a + (-3/8) = -2/3.

So, a = -2/3 + 3/8.

Convert to common denominator, which is 24.

-2/3 = -16/24, 3/8 = 9/24.

So, a = (-16/24 +9/24)= (-7)/24.

So, a = -7/24.

Now, from equation 8: c = (-3/8) -1/24.

Convert to 24 denominator:

-3/8 = -9/24, 1/24 =1/24.

So, c = -9/24 -1/24 = -10/24 = -5/12.

So, a = -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.

Now, let's check these values in the original equations.

Equation 1: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12).

Compute each term:

-7/24.

-(-3/8)= +3/8 = +9/24.

-(-5/12)= +5/12 = +10/24.

So, total: (-7 +9 +10)/24 = (12)/24 = 1/2. Which matches equation 1.

Equation 2: -a + b -c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12).

Which is 7/24 -3/8 +5/12.

Convert to 24:

7/24 -9/24 +10/24= (7 -9 +10)/24=8/24=1/3. Which matches equation 2.

Equation3: -a -b +c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12).

Which is 7/24 +3/8 -5/12.

Convert to 24:

7/24 +9/24 -10/24= (7+9-10)/24=6/24=1/4. Which matches equation3.

Okay, so the values are correct.

Now, we need to compute 4a +3b +2c.

Let me compute each term:

4a =4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6.

3b =3*(-3/8)= -9/8.

2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6.

So, sum them up:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

First, combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7-5)/6= -12/6= -2.

So, now we have -2 -9/8.

Convert -2 to eighths: -16/8.

So, -16/8 -9/8= -25/8.

So, 4a +3b +2c= -25/8.

But the problem says absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²), so | -25/8 | =25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25, n=8, which are coprime.

Thus, m +n=25 +8=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We introduce \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). This transforms the equations into:

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

Adding all three equations, we get:
\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}
\]

We now have:
4. \(-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}\)

By adding and subtracting pairs of the original equations, we derive:
- From equations 1 and 4: \(b + c = -\frac{19}{24}\)
- From equations 2 and 4: \(a + c = -\frac{17}{24}\)
- From equations 3 and 4: \(a + b = -\frac{2}{3}\)

Solving these, we find:
- \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\)
- \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\)
- \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\)

We need to compute \(4a + 3b + 2c\):
\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right)
\]
\[
= -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}
\]
\[
= -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \(\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
