Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. So, we have two rectangles. Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC, which are 107 and 16 respectively. Rectangle EFGH has sides FG and EF, which are 17 and 184. So, ABCD is a much larger rectangle compared to EFGH.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, I can imagine that these points lie on a straight line, probably the base of the rectangles or some other side. But since D is a corner of ABCD and E is a corner of EFGH, I think the line DECF must be a common side or something similar.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. So, there's a circle passing through A, D, H, G. That might be important because cyclic quadrilaterals have some properties we can use, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees or the power of a point.

Let me think about the properties of rectangles. All angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. So, in rectangle ABCD, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, let me consider the line on which they lie. Let's say it's the x-axis for simplicity. So, I can assign coordinates to the points.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to make calculations easier.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16, point A would be at (0,16), point B at (107,16), and point C at (107,0). Wait, but then if D is at (0,0), and since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's see where E and F would be.

Wait, but point C is at (107,0), and D is at (0,0), so the line D, E, C, F is the x-axis from (0,0) through (107,0) and beyond. So, point E must lie somewhere on this line, either between D and C or beyond C.

Similarly, point F should be on the same line. So, if EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is 184, and FG is 17, then E is one corner, F is the next, G and H are the other two.

Wait, but if E is on the x-axis, then F is also on the x-axis, since D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the rectangle EFGH would have points E and F on the x-axis, and G and H somewhere else. Since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are perpendicular. So, if EF is on the x-axis, then FG would be vertical.

But wait, the sides of the rectangle EFGH: EF is 184 and FG is 17. So, the rectangle EFGH is 184 units long along the x-axis and 17 units high. So, if E is at some point (x,0), then F would be at (x+184,0), and G would be at (x+184,17), H at (x,17). But wait, considering the orientation, it depends on the order of the letters.

Wait, rectangles are usually labeled in order, so EFGH would have sides EF, FG, GH, HE. So, starting at E, moving to F, then G, then H, then back to E.

So, if E is on the x-axis, then F is to the right (or left) of E, and G is above F, and H is above E, connected back to E.

But in our case, since D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis, and E comes after D and before C or after C? Hmm, let me consider both possibilities.

Wait, let's suppose that E is between D and C. So, D is at (0,0), then E is somewhere between (0,0) and (107,0). Then F would be to the right of E, but since EF is 184, which is longer than DC (107), F would be beyond C at (E_x + 184, 0). But then C is at (107,0), so if E is at (a,0), then F would be at (a+184,0). But if E is somewhere between D and C, then a is between 0 and 107, so F would be at (a+184,0), which is way beyond C.

Alternatively, maybe E is beyond C. So, E is at (107 + b, 0), where b is positive, and F is at (107 + b + 184, 0). But I don't know yet.

Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates step by step.

Let me fix the coordinate system.

Let me place point D at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C is at (107,0), point B at (107,16), and point A at (0,16).

Now, since E is on the line DC, which is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). Let's say point E is at (e,0), where e is a value between 0 and 107 or beyond.

Then, since EFGH is a rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17. Since E is at (e,0), F would be at (e + 184, 0), and then G would be at (e + 184, 17), and H at (e,17).

But wait, in the problem statement, it says that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A, D, H, G must lie on a circle.

Point A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (e,17), and G is at (e+184,17).

Wait, so four points: (0,16), (0,0), (e,17), (e+184,17).

These four points must lie on a circle. So, we can use the property that four points lie on a circle if the determinant of the following matrix is zero:

|x   y   x²+y²  1|
for each point.

But that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe we can use the cyclic quadrilateral properties, such as the power of a point or something else.

Alternatively, since three points define a circle, we can find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, and H, then check whether G lies on it.

Let me try that.

First, find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and H(e,17).

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Plugging in D(0,0):

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0.

So, the equation simplifies to x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Now, plug in A(0,16):

0 + (16)^2 + 0 + 2f(16) = 0 => 256 + 32f = 0 => 32f = -256 => f = -8.

So, the equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx - 16y = 0.

Now, plug in H(e,17):

e² + (17)^2 + 2g e - 16(17) = 0

Calculate 17^2: 289. 16*17=272.

So,

e² + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0

Simplify:

e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Wait, this is equation (1): e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Now, we also need point G(e + 184,17) to lie on this circle.

So, plug G into the circle equation:

(e + 184)^2 + (17)^2 + 2g(e + 184) - 16*(17) = 0.

Compute each term:

(e + 184)^2 = e² + 368e + 184².

17^2 is 289.

2g(e + 184) = 2g e + 368g.

-16*17 = -272.

Putting it all together:

[e² + 368e + (184)^2] + 289 + [2g e + 368g] - 272 = 0.

Simplify the constants:

(184)^2 is 33856. 33856 + 289 = 34145. 34145 - 272 = 33873.

So,

e² + 368e + 33873 + 2g e + 368g = 0.

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me write this as:

e² + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0.

But from equation (1), we have:

e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

So, e² = -2g e -17.

Let me substitute e² into the equation from point G:

(-2g e -17) + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0.

Expand:

-2g e -17 + 368e + 2g e + 33873 + 368g = 0.

Notice that -2g e and +2g e cancel each other.

So, left with:

(-17) + 368e + 33873 + 368g = 0.

Simplify constants:

-17 + 33873 = 33856.

So,

368e + 33856 + 368g = 0.

Factor out 368:

368*(e + g) + 33856 = 0.

Divide both sides by 368:

(e + g) + (33856 / 368) = 0.

Calculate 33856 / 368.

Well, 368 * 92 = 368*(90 + 2) = 368*90=33120, 368*2=736. Total 33120 +736=33856. So, 33856 / 368 = 92.

So,

e + g + 92 = 0 => e + g = -92.

So, from equation (1): e² + 2g e +17 = 0.

We can write this as:

e² + 2g e = -17.

But from e + g = -92, we can write g = -92 - e.

Substitute g into equation (1):

e² + 2*(-92 - e)*e = -17.

Compute:

e² + 2*(-92 e - e²) = -17.

e² -184 e -2 e² = -17.

Combine like terms:

- e² -184 e = -17.

Multiply both sides by -1:

e² + 184 e = 17.

So,

e² + 184 e -17 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in e.

Let me solve for e using the quadratic formula.

e = [ -184 ± sqrt(184² + 4*17) ] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

184^2 = (180 + 4)^2 = 180² + 2*180*4 +4² = 32400 + 1440 + 16 = 33856.

4*17=68.

So, discriminant = 33856 + 68 = 33924.

sqrt(33924). Let me compute sqrt(33924).

Well, 184^2 is 33856, so 184^2 + 68 = 33924. Let me see, 184.2^2 is approximately 184^2 + 2*184*0.2 +0.2^2=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64, which is higher than 33924. So, maybe 184.1^2=?

Wait, perhaps I can factor 33924.

Divide by 4: 33924 /4=8481.

8481: let's check if it's a square. 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So, 92^2=8464, which is less than 8481. 8481-8464=17, so not a perfect square. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the discriminant:

Discriminant = 184^2 + 4*1*17 = 33856 + 68 = 33924.

Wait, perhaps 33924 is a perfect square. Let's see: 184^2=33856, 185^2=34225. So, 33924 is between them.

Compute 184.5^2: (184 + 0.5)^2=184^2 + 2*184*0.5 +0.25=33856 +184 +0.25=34040.25, which is higher than 33924.

Wait, so the square root is between 184 and 184.5. Hmm, but maybe it's an integer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra earlier. Let me retrace.

We had:

From point G's equation, after substituting e + g = -92, we ended up with e² + 184 e -17=0.

Wait, discriminant is 184^2 + 4*17 = 33856 +68=33924.

Wait, 33924 divided by 4 is 8481, which as I said earlier isn't a perfect square. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me re-express the equations.

We have points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(e+184,17) lying on a circle.

We found the circle equation to be x² + y² + 2g x -16 y =0, with g to be determined.

Then, plugging H(e,17):

e² + 17² + 2g e -16*17 =0 => e² + 289 + 2g e -272 =0 => e² +2g e +17=0. Correct.

Then, plugging G(e+184,17):

(e+184)^2 +17² +2g(e+184) -16*17=0

Which is (e² + 368e + 33856) + 289 + 2g e + 368 g - 272=0.

Wait, 17² is 289, and 16*17=272.

So, (e² + 368e + 33856) + 289 -272 + 2g e + 368g=0.

Compute constants: 33856 + (289 -272) = 33856 +17=33873.

So, e² +368e +33873 +2g e +368g=0.

Then, e² + (368 + 2g)e +33873 +368g=0.

We have from H: e² +2g e +17=0 => e²= -2g e -17.

Substituting into G's equation:

(-2g e -17) + (368 + 2g)e +33873 +368g=0.

Which is -2g e -17 +368 e +2g e +33873 +368g=0.

Simplify: (-2g e + 2g e) cancels out. So, -17 +368 e +33873 +368g=0.

Which becomes 368 e + 33856 +368g=0.

Factor 368: 368 (e + g) +33856=0.

Divide by 368: e + g + (33856 / 368)=0.

Compute 33856 / 368: Well, 368 * 92 = 33856 (since 368*90=33120, 368*2=736; 33120+736=33856). So, 33856/368=92.

Thus, e + g +92=0 => e + g= -92.

So, g= -92 -e.

Substitute into equation from H: e² +2g e +17=0.

g= -92 -e => 2g e=2*(-92 -e)*e= -184 e -2 e².

So, equation becomes:

e² + (-184 e -2 e²) +17=0.

Combine like terms: e² -2 e² -184 e +17=0 => -e² -184 e +17=0.

Multiply both sides by -1: e² + 184 e -17=0.

Which is the same as before.

So, discriminant D=184² +4*1*17=33856 +68=33924.

Hmm, so sqrt(33924). Let me check if it's 184.25² or something.

Wait, 184.25^2 = (184 + 0.25)^2=184^2 + 2*184*0.25 +0.0625=33856 +92 +0.0625=33948.0625, which is higher than 33924. So, not that.

Wait, perhaps it's 184.111... something.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption of the coordinate system.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that E is not on the same line as DC but on another line? Wait, no, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so they lie on the same straight line, which I assumed as the x-axis.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangles are arranged differently. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps E is not between D and C but beyond C. So, E is at (107 + a, 0), and F is at (107 + a + 184, 0). Then G is at (107 + a +184,17), and H is at (107 + a,17). But in that case, would the circle pass through A, D, H, G?

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this problem with vectors or coordinate geometry.

Wait, another approach: since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the power of point D with respect to that circle is zero.

Wait, the power of point D would be equal for all lines through D. But since D is on the circle, the power is zero.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the cyclic quadrilateral property. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the lengths of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides. Wait, no, that's for a rectangle. Wait, no, that might not apply here.

Wait, another property is that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the perpendicular distances from any point on the circle to two opposite sides is equal. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates is the way to go, despite the messy equations.

So, let's get back to the quadratic equation.

e² + 184 e -17 =0.

So, e = [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*17) ] / 2.

Compute sqrt(33924). Let me see, 184^2 is 33856, so sqrt(33924)=sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(184² + 68).

Wait, perhaps 184.034 or something, but maybe it's a whole number. Wait, 33924 divided by 4 is 8481, which is 92^2 + (17). Wait, 92^2=8464, 92^2 +17=8481. So, 8481=92² +17. Hmm, not a perfect square. So sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481). Hmm, 8481 is 92² +17, which isn't a square.

So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier. Maybe the line D, E, C, F isn't the x-axis but another line.

Wait, perhaps I should place point D at (0,0), but not necessarily on the x-axis. Alternatively, maybe the rectangles are arranged such that line DECF is the base for both, but in different orientations.

Wait, but rectangles have right angles, so the sides are perpendicular.

Alternatively, perhaps the line DECF is not a horizontal line but some other line.

Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates differently. Let me try a different approach.

Let me assume that the line DECF is the x-axis, as before, but maybe the rectangles are placed differently. So, point D is at (0,0), point C is at (107,0). Point E is somewhere on the x-axis, say at (e,0). Then, rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17.

So, point F is at (e + 184,0). Then, since EFGH is a rectangle, point G would be at (e + 184,17), and point H at (e,17).

Wait, but then points A, D, H, G are (0,16), (0,0), (e,17), (e+184,17).

We can find the circle passing through these four points.

Wait, but when I tried that earlier, I ended up with a quadratic equation that didn't have integer solutions, which is a problem because the problem is expecting an integer answer for CE.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate assignments.

Wait, perhaps the line DECF is not the x-axis but another line, maybe the y-axis? No, that wouldn't make sense because then point C would be at (0,16), which doesn't fit with the given BC=16.

Wait, perhaps I should arrange the points differently. Maybe the line DECF is vertical. Let me try that.

Let me place D at (0,0), and since DECF is a vertical line, points E, C, F lie on the y-axis. So, point C would be at (0,107), since BC=16 and AB=107, but wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB is the length and BC is the width.

Wait, no, if ABCD is a rectangle, then AB is the length and BC is the width. So, if AB is 107, then AD is 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then A is at (0,16), B at (107,16), and C at (107,0). So, DECF can't be a vertical line because C is at (107,0) and D is at (0,0), so they lie on the x-axis.

Thus, my initial assumption seems correct: D, E, C, F are on the x-axis.

Wait, but perhaps E is on the extension of DC beyond C, so E is at (107 + a, 0), and F is at (107 + a + 184, 0). Then, H is at (107 + a,17), and G is at (107 + a + 184,17).

Wait, but then point H would be at (107 + a,17), and point G at (107 + a +184,17). Then, points A(0,16), D(0,0), H, and G must lie on a circle.

Wait, let me try that approach.

So, points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(107+a,17), G(107+a+184,17).

Wait, perhaps this will lead to a different equation.

Let me proceed.

The circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(107+a,17), and G(291+a,17).

Wait, 107 + a + 184 = 291 + a.

So, the four points are (0,16), (0,0), (107+a,17), and (291+a,17).

Let me find the equation of the circle passing through these points.

The general equation is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.

Plugging in D(0,0):

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c=0 => c=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy =0.

Plugging in A(0,16):

0 + (16)^2 + 0 + 2f(16) =0 => 256 +32f =0 => f= -8.

So, equation becomes x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Now, plug in H(107+a,17):

(107+a)^2 +17² +2g(107+a) -16*17=0.

Compute each term:

(107+a)^2= 107² + 214a +a²=11449 +214a +a².

17²=289.

2g(107+a)=214g + 2g a.

-16*17= -272.

So, putting together:

11449 +214a +a² +289 +214g +2g a -272=0.

Simplify constants: 11449 + 289 = 11738; 11738 -272=11466.

So,

a² +214a +214g +2g a +11466=0.

Similarly, plug in G(291+a,17):

(291+a)^2 +17² +2g(291+a) -16*17=0.

Compute each term:

(291+a)^2=291² + 582a +a²=84681 +582a +a².

17²=289.

2g(291+a)=582g +2g a.

-16*17=-272.

So,

84681 +582a +a² +289 +582g +2g a -272=0.

Simplify constants:84681 +289=84970; 84970 -272=84698.

So,

a² +582a +582g +2g a +84698=0.

Now, we have two equations:

1) a² +214a +214g +2g a +11466=0.

2) a² +582a +582g +2g a +84698=0.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a² and 2g a:

(a² +582a +582g +2g a +84698) - (a² +214a +214g +2g a +11466) =0.

Simplify:

(582a -214a) + (582g -214g) + (84698 -11466)=0.

Compute each term:

582a -214a=368a.

582g -214g=368g.

84698 -11466=73232.

So,

368a +368g +73232=0.

Factor out 368:

368(a +g) +73232=0.

Divide both sides by 368:

a +g + (73232/368)=0.

Compute 73232 ÷368.

Well, 368*199=368*(200-1)=73600-368=73232.

So, 73232/368=199.

Thus,

a + g +199=0 => a + g= -199.

So, from equation 1:

a² +214a +214g +2g a +11466=0.

We can substitute g= -199 -a into this equation.

So, equation becomes:

a² +214a +214*(-199 -a) +2*(-199 -a)*a +11466=0.

Compute each term:

214*(-199 -a)= -214*199 -214a.

-214*199: Let me compute 200*200=40000, but 214*200=42,800. So, 214*199=214*(200-1)=42800 -214=42586.

So, 214*(-199 -a)= -42586 -214a.

Similarly, 2*(-199 -a)*a= -2*199 a -2a²= -398a -2a².

Now, put all together:

a² +214a -42586 -214a -398a -2a² +11466=0.

Combine like terms:

a² -2a²= -a².

214a -214a -398a= -398a.

-42586 +11466= -31120.

So,

- a² -398a -31120=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

a² +398a +31120=0.

This is a quadratic equation in a.

Let me try to solve for a.

a = [ -398 ± sqrt(398² -4*1*31120) ] /2.

Compute discriminant:

398²= (400 -2)^2=160000 - 2*400*2 +4=160000 -1600 +4=158404.

4*1*31120=124480.

So, discriminant=158404 -124480=33924.

Wait, that's the same discriminant as before! sqrt(33924)= same as before, which is around 184.178.

So,

a = [ -398 ± 184.178 ] / 2.

So, two possibilities:

1) a= [ -398 +184.178 ] /2= (-213.822)/2≈-106.911.

2) a= [ -398 -184.178 ] /2= (-582.178)/2≈-291.089.

Hmm, but a represents the shift from C's position, which is at (107,0). So, E is at (107 +a,0). So, if a is negative, E is to the left of C.

But since E is supposed to be on the same line as D and C, but could be on either side.

Wait, but if a≈-106.911, then E is at (107 -106.911,0)= (0.089,0), which is very close to D at (0,0). Alternatively, if a≈-291.089, E is at (107 -291.089,0)= (-184.089,0), which is far to the left of D.

Hmm, but these are approximate values. Maybe the exact values can be found.

Wait, the discriminant is 33924, which we know is 184^2 +4*17=33924.

Wait, but earlier, we saw that 33924= 184.034^2 approximately.

But regardless, perhaps these a's are not integers, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the orientation of the rectangles.

Wait, maybe the rectangles are arranged such that EFGH is above the line DECF, not below. So, in that case, the y-coordinates of H and G would be positive, but maybe H is at (e, -17) and G at (e+184, -17). Let me try that.

So, points H and G would be at (e, -17) and (e+184, -17). Then, points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,-17), G(e+184,-17).

Let me find the circle passing through these four points.

Again, using the general equation x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0.

Plug in D(0,0): c=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² +2gx +2fy=0.

Plug in A(0,16):

0 + 256 +0 +32f=0 => 256 +32f=0 =>f= -8.

So, equation is x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Plug in H(e,-17):

e² + (-17)^2 +2g e -16*(-17)=0.

Compute:

e² +289 +2g e +272=0.

So,

e² +2g e +561=0. Equation (1).

Plug in G(e+184,-17):

(e+184)^2 + (-17)^2 +2g(e+184) -16*(-17)=0.

Compute:

(e+184)^2 +289 +2g e +368g +272=0.

Expand (e+184)^2: e² +368e +33856.

So,

e² +368e +33856 +289 +2g e +368g +272=0.

Simplify constants:33856 +289=34145; 34145 +272=34417.

So,

e² +368e +2g e +34417 +368g=0.

Now, from equation (1): e² +2g e= -561.

Substitute into G's equation:

(-561) +368e +34417 +368g=0.

Simplify:

368e +368g +34417 -561=0.

Compute constants:34417 -561=33856.

So,

368e +368g +33856=0.

Factor 368:

368(e +g) +33856=0.

Divide by 368:

e +g + (33856/368)=0.

Compute 33856 ÷368=92.

So,

e +g +92=0 => e +g= -92.

So, g= -92 -e.

Substitute into equation (1):

e² +2*(-92 -e)*e +561=0.

Compute:

e² -184e -2e² +561=0.

Combine terms:

-e² -184e +561=0.

Multiply by -1:

e² +184e -561=0.

Now, solve for e.

e = [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*561) ] /2.

Compute discriminant:

184²=33856.

4*561=2244.

So, D=33856 +2244=36100.

sqrt(36100)=190.

So, e = [ -184 ±190 ] /2.

Two possibilities:

1) [ -184 +190 ] /2=6/2=3.

2) [ -184 -190 ] /2= -374/2= -187.

So, e=3 or e=-187.

So, possible e values are 3 and -187.

Now, let's consider each case.

Case 1: e=3.

Then, g= -92 -3= -95.

So, the circle equation is x² + y² +2*(-95)x -16y=0 => x² + y² -190x -16y=0.

Let me check if points H(3,-17) and G(187,-17) lie on this circle.

For H(3,-17):

3² + (-17)^2 -190*3 -16*(-17)=9 +289 -570 +272.

Compute: 9+289=298; 298 -570= -272; -272 +272=0. So yes, H lies on the circle.

For G(187,-17):

187² + (-17)^2 -190*187 -16*(-17).

Compute 187²=34969.

(-17)^2=289.

-190*187= -35530.

-16*(-17)=272.

So, 34969 +289=35258; 35258 -35530= -272; -272 +272=0. So, G also lies on the circle.

Good.

Case 2: e= -187.

Then, g= -92 -(-187)=95.

So, the circle equation is x² + y² +2*95x -16y=0 => x² + y² +190x -16y=0.

Check H(-187,-17):

(-187)^2 + (-17)^2 +190*(-187) -16*(-17).

Compute:

(-187)^2=34969.

(-17)^2=289.

190*(-187)= -35530.

-16*(-17)=272.

So,

34969 +289=35258.

35258 -35530= -272.

-272 +272=0. So, H lies on the circle.

For G(-187+184, -17)=G(-3,-17):

(-3)^2 + (-17)^2 +190*(-3) -16*(-17).

Compute:

9 +289=298.

190*(-3)= -570.

-16*(-17)=272.

So,

298 -570= -272.

-272 +272=0. So, G also lies on the circle.

Good.

So, both cases are valid.

Now, let's consider each case to find CE.

First, Case 1: e=3.

So, point E is at (e,0)= (3,0).

Point C is at (107,0).

Thus, CE is the distance between (3,0) and (107,0), which is 107 -3=104 units.

Case 2: e= -187.

Point E is at (-187,0).

Point C is at (107,0).

Thus, CE is the distance between (-187,0) and (107,0), which is 107 - (-187)=107 +187=294 units.

But the problem doesn't specify the position of E relative to C, so both could be possible. However, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that D, E, C, F are collinear. If E is at -187, then F would be at e +184= -187 +184= -3, which is to the left of E. So, the points would be D(0,0), E(-187,0), F(-3,0), C(107,0). But this arrangement makes E and F on the same line, but E is far to the left, which is possible.

But in the problem statement, it's not clear whether E is between D and C or beyond C. So, both solutions are mathematically valid. However, since the problem asks for CE, which is a length, it's positive, and perhaps we need to find the positive length.

But wait, the problem might have a unique solution. Let me check the rectangles.

In case e=3: E is at (3,0), F is at (3+184,0)=187,0. So, the rectangle EFGH has points E(3,0), F(187,0), G(187,-17), H(3,-17). So, the rectangle is placed below the x-axis, with E and F on the x-axis.

In this case, CE is 107 -3=104.

In case e=-187: E is at (-187,0), F is at (-187+184,0)=(-3,0). So, rectangle EFGH has points E(-187,0), F(-3,0), G(-3,-17), H(-187,-17). So, the rectangle spans from -187 to -3 on the x-axis, below the x-axis.

In this case, CE is 107 - (-187)= 294.

So, both are possible. But we need to see if the problem has constraints that exclude one of them.

Wait, the problem says "Rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear. Also, A,D,H,G all lie on a circle."

Looking back, in my earlier assumption, when e=3, point H is at (3,-17), which is below the x-axis, while point A is at (0,16). So, the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), and G(187,-17).

Similarly, when e=-187, H is at (-187,-17), and G is at (-3,-17).

But in the first case, CE=104; in the second, CE=294.

But which one is the correct answer? Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, the problem states that "D,E,C,F are collinear." So, the order is D, E, C, F on the line.

So, the order should be D followed by E, then C, then F. So, E must lie between D and C, or C must lie between E and F.

Wait, in the first case, e=3, so E is at (3,0), C is at (107,0), F is at 187,0. So, order is D(0), E(3), C(107), F(187). So, D, E, C, F are in order on the line, which satisfies the condition.

In the second case, e=-187, so E is at (-187,0), F is at (-3,0), C is at (107,0). So, the order on the line would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So, D is between F and C. But the problem states D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order is D, E, C, F. So, in this case, E is at (-187,0), D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0), F is at (-3,0). So, the order would be E, D, C, F. But the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order should be D, then E, then C, then F. So, the second case doesn't satisfy this order because E is to the left of D.

Thus, the second case is invalid because it doesn't follow the order D, E, C, F.

Therefore, only the first case is valid, where e=3, so CE=107 -3=104.

Wait, but let me double-check. In the second case, E is at (-187,0), which is left of D(0,0), so the order would be E, D, C, F. But the problem states D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E must come after D, so E is to the right of D. Thus, the second case is invalid because E is to the left of D, making the order E, D, C, F, which doesn't match the problem's statement.

Therefore, the correct value is CE=104.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given information and use coordinate geometry and the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

1. **Assigning Coordinates:**
   - Place point \( D \) at the origin \((0,0)\).
   - Since \( ABCD \) is a rectangle with \( BC = 16 \) and \( AB = 107 \), the coordinates are:
     - \( A(0, 16) \)
     - \( B(107, 16) \)
     - \( C(107, 0) \)

2. **Positioning Points \( E \) and \( F \):**
   - Points \( D, E, C, F \) are collinear on the x-axis.
   - Let \( E \) be at \((e, 0)\) and \( F \) at \((e + 184, 0)\), since \( EF = 184 \).

3. **Coordinates of \( G \) and \( H \):**
   - Since \( EFGH \) is a rectangle with \( FG = 17 \), the coordinates are:
     - \( G(e + 184, -17) \)
     - \( H(e, -17) \)

4. **Circle Passing Through \( A, D, H, G \):**
   - The general equation of the circle is \( x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 \).
   - Substituting \( D(0,0) \) gives \( c = 0 \).
   - Substituting \( A(0,16) \) gives \( f = -8 \).
   - The circle equation becomes \( x^2 + y^2 + 2gx - 16y = 0 \).

5. **Substituting \( H(e, -17) \) and \( G(e + 184, -17) \):**
   - For \( H(e, -17) \):
     \[
     e^2 + (-17)^2 + 2ge - 16(-17) = 0 \implies e^2 + 2ge + 561 = 0.
     \]
   - For \( G(e + 184, -17) \):
     \[
     (e + 184)^2 + (-17)^2 + 2g(e + 184) - 16(-17) = 0.
     \]
     Simplifying and substituting \( g = -92 - e \) from earlier, we solve the quadratic equation:
     \[
     e^2 + 184e - 561 = 0.
     \]
     The solutions are \( e = 3 \) and \( e = -187 \).

6. **Determining Valid \( e \):**
   - For \( e = 3 \), \( E \) is at \((3, 0)\) and \( F \) at \((187, 0)\), satisfying the order \( D, E, C, F \).
   - For \( e = -187 \), \( E \) is at \((-187, 0)\), which does not satisfy the order \( D, E, C, F \).

7. **Calculating \( CE \):**
   - With \( e = 3 \), \( C \) is at \((107, 0)\), so \( CE = 107 - 3 = 104 \).

Thus, the length of \( CE \) is \(\boxed{104}\).
