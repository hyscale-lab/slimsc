Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but at a certain distance from the center of the circle. The problem says the radius of the circle being revolved is 3, and the distance from the center of that circle to the axis of revolution is 6. 

The sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's placed outside, tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties of tori and tangent spheres.

First, a torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this problem, the circle being revolved has a radius of 3, so that's the minor radius, and the major radius is 6 because the circle is 6 units away from the axis.

So, R = 6 and r = 3 for the torus.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. I think this means that the torus is just touching the sphere at that circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's externally tangent.

Let me think about the internal tangency case first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's surface is larger, so the point of tangency would be on the outer part of the torus's tube.

Wait, but the torus is symmetric, so when it's resting inside, the furthest point from the center of the sphere on the torus must be equal to the sphere's radius. Similarly, when it's outside, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center must be equal to the sphere's radius.

Wait, no. Maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

The sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside, it's tangent along a circle, which I believe is the equator of the torus. Similarly, when it's outside, maybe the tangent circle is on the outside.

Alternatively, perhaps the tangent circles are the points where the torus just touches the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus and the sphere mathematically.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's suppose the sphere is centered at the origin (0,0,0). The torus, when resting inside, would have its center also at the origin? Or maybe not. Wait, no. Because the torus is a surface; its center is at the center of the major circle.

Wait,
