Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let's try to unpack it step by step. The problem says:

"Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB·AC."

Alright, so we need to find the product of the lengths of sides AB and AC in triangle ABC. Let me jot down what I know:

- Triangle ABC has circumradius R = 13. So, the formula for the circumradius is R = (a)/(2 sin A) = (b)/(2 sin B) = (c)/(2 sin C) = 13.

- The inradius is r = 6. The inradius formula is r = (Area)/(s), where s is the semiperimeter.

- IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I.

Hmm, that's an interesting condition. IA ⊥ OI. I remember that in some triangles, the incenter and circumcenter have particular relationships, but I'm not sure about the specifics here. Maybe I should draw a rough sketch to visualize.

So, triangle ABC, with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. Let's denote the centroid as G, but I don't think it's relevant here. The inradius is 6, which is pretty large given the circumradius is 13. So, the triangle isn't too big, but it's not a small one either.

I recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Is that correct? Wait, yes, I think that's right. So, OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me verify:

Yes, the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, plugging in R=13 and r=6, we get:

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, that's interesting. The distance between O and I is sqrt(13).

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, which implies that the dot product is zero. But maybe there's a formula or relation that can help here.

Let me think about the inradius and the distances from the incenter. The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6. The length IA is the distance from the incenter I to vertex A.

I remember there are formulas for the lengths from the incenter to the vertices. For example, the length of IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.

The formula for IA is 2r / (1 - cos A/2). Hmm, wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, I think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me confirm.

Yes, IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), and IC = r / sin(C/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2). Got it.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle OIA, by Pythagoras' theorem:

OA² = OI² + IA².

But OA is the distance from O to A, which is the circumradius R, so OA = 13.

So, we have:

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²

169 = 13 + IA²

So, IA² = 169 -13 = 156

Thus, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

But we also have IA = 6 / sin(A/2). So,

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)

Solving for sin(A/2):

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13

Let me compute cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. So,

cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169

So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13

Since A is an angle of a triangle, A/2 is less than 90 degrees, so cos(A/2) is positive.

Alright, now, let's think about what else we can do. We're supposed to find AB·AC. Let's recall the sides of the triangle.

In triangle ABC, sides opposite to angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively. So, AB = c, AC = b, BC = a.

Wait, no. Actually, side opposite to A is BC, which is a. So, AB is opposite to C, which is c, and AC is opposite to B, which is b. So, AB = c, AC = b. So, AB·AC = b*c.

We need to find b*c.

Hmm, how can we find b*c? Maybe using the formula involving the inradius and semiperimeter.

Wait, the area of the triangle is r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. Since r=6, area = 6*s.

Also, the area can be expressed using the formula (a*b*c)/(4R). Since R=13, area = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6*s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 6*s*52 = 312*s.

But I don't know s yet. Maybe we can find s in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, let's think about expressing b*c in terms of other quantities.

Wait, we also know that the product b*c can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. From the Law of Sines, we have:

b = 2R sin B = 26 sin B

c = 2R sin C = 26 sin C

So, b*c = (26 sin B)(26 sin C) = 676 sin B sin C

Hmm, but I don't know angles B and C. Alternatively, since the triangle has angles A, B, C, and A/2 is known in terms of sine and cosine.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the area in terms of inradius and semiperimeter, and also in terms of sides and angles.

Alternatively, let's consider using the formula for the length IA, which we found earlier. So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39).

We also found that sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Now, let's recall the formula for the semiperimeter s.

s = (a + b + c)/2

Also, the area Δ = r*s = 6s

Additionally, the area can be written as Δ = (1/2)*b*c*sin A

So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A => 12s = b*c*sin A

So, if I can find sin A, I can relate b*c to s.

But we know sin(A/2), so we can find sin A using the double-angle formula.

sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/169

Compute 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so 3900+1170=5070. So sqrt(5070).

Wait, 5070 = 10*507 = 10*3*169 = 10*3*13². So sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*3*13²)=13*sqrt(30)

So, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13

So, sin A = (2 sqrt(30))/13

Plugging back into 12s = b*c*sin A:

12s = b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) => b*c = (12s *13)/(2 sqrt(30)) = (6s *13)/sqrt(30)= (78 s)/sqrt(30)

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe we can find another equation involving s.

We also know that in any triangle, the Law of Cosines holds. So, a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A

But we don't know a, b, c, so that might not be directly helpful.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the semiperimeter s in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, let's use the formula for the distance OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13, which we had earlier. So, OI = sqrt(13).

We know OI is sqrt(13), and IA is 2 sqrt(39). Also, in triangle OIA, OA =13, OI= sqrt(13), IA=2 sqrt(39), which we've already used.

Wait, but perhaps we can use trigonometric identities in triangle OIA. Since angle at I is 90 degrees, maybe we can find some angles there.

Wait, triangle OIA is right-angled at I, so angles at O and A can be found.

Let's compute angle at O: let's denote angle OIA as θ.

So, in triangle OIA:

sin θ = opposite / hypotenuse = IA / OA = (2 sqrt(39))/13

So, sin θ = (2 sqrt(39))/13

Similarly, cos θ = OI / OA = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13)

Wait, let me compute these:

sin θ = (2 sqrt(39))/13. Let's square this: (4*39)/169 = 156/169, which is less than 1, so that's okay.

Similarly, cos θ = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13). So, θ is the angle at O, which is angle between OI and OA.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe we can relate this angle to the triangle ABC's angles.

Wait, in triangle ABC, O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter. The line OI connects the circumcenter to the incenter. The angle between OI and IA is 90 degrees, so maybe there's a relationship involving angles of the triangle ABC.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use vector approaches or coordinate geometry, but that might get complicated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula that relates distances from the inradius and exradius.

Alternatively, think about the coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system.

Let me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Let me place point A somewhere on the circumcircle, say at coordinates (13,0), since the circumradius is 13.

But wait, if I do that, then O is at (0,0), and point A is at (13,0). Then, the incenter I is somewhere inside the triangle.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the line connecting O(0,0) to I(x,y). So, the vector OI is (x,y), and the vector IA is from I(x,y) to A(13,0), which is (13 - x, -y). These two vectors are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.

So, (x,y)·(13 - x, -y) = 0 => x(13 - x) + y*(-y) = 0 => 13x - x² - y² =0

So, 13x = x² + y²

But I is the incenter, so it's located at coordinates ( (aA_x + bB_x + cC_x)/(a+b+c), (aA_y + bB_y + cC_y)/(a+b+c) ), but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the inradius: r = Δ/s, where Δ is the area, s is semiperimeter.

But I don't know the sides yet.

Wait, another thought: since we have the inradius and the circumradius, maybe we can find other triangle properties, like the distance between O and I, which we already did (sqrt(13)), and perhaps relate that to other distances or angles.

Wait, we can use the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter with the sides of the triangle. The formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr, which we used earlier, and that gave us OI = sqrt(13).

We also have the relation that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle OIA, which is right-angled, we found IA = 2 sqrt(39), and OA=13.

Wait, another idea: perhaps using trigonometric identities in triangle OIA. Since we found sin(theta) and cos(theta), maybe we can relate theta to angle A.

Wait, angle theta is the angle at O in triangle OIA, which is between OI and OA. Hmm, in the coordinate system, OA is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (13,0), and OI is the line from (0,0) to I(x,y). The angle between them is theta, which we found.

But I'm not sure how to connect this angle theta to angle A of triangle ABC.

Alternatively, perhaps express the coordinates of I in terms of the triangle's sides.

Wait, the coordinates approach might be too involved without knowing more about the triangle.

Alternatively, let's think about the formula for the inradius and semiperimeter.

We have r = 6, R = 13. The formula connecting R, r, and OI is OI² = R² - 2Rr, which we used, giving OI = sqrt(13).

We have IA = 2 sqrt(39), and IA is the distance from I to A. So, perhaps we can express IA in terms of the sides.

Wait, another formula: in any triangle, the length from the inradius to vertex A is given by IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite angle A.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.

Yes, I recall that the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). So, IA² = r² + (s - a)^2.

We found IA² = (2 sqrt(39))² = 4*39=156.

So, 156 = r² + (s - a)^2 => 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 => (s - a)^2 = 120 => s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)

So, s - a = 2 sqrt(30)

Similarly, for other vertices, IB² = r² + (s - b)^2, IC² = r² + (s - c)^2.

But maybe we can find expressions for s - a, s - b, s - c.

We know that in a triangle, s = (a + b + c)/2, so:

s - a = ( -a + b + c )/2

Similarly,

s - b = (a - b + c)/2

s - c = (a + b - c)/2

So, s - a = 2 sqrt(30) => (-a + b + c)/2 = 2 sqrt(30) => -a + b + c = 4 sqrt(30)

Similarly, perhaps we can find other relations, but we only have one equation so far.

Alternatively, since s = (a + b + c)/2, let's denote s = (a + b + c)/2.

We have s - a = 2 sqrt(30) => s = a + 2 sqrt(30)

Hmm, but that's not helpful because s = (a + b + c)/2, so a + b + c = 2s.

If s = a + 2 sqrt(30), then a + b + c = 2a + 4 sqrt(30) => b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30)

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps we can use the area expressions. The area is 6s, and also (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52.

So, 6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s

So, if we can find another equation involving a, b, c, and s, we might be able to solve for the product b*c.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the distance between O and I, which is sqrt(13), and in terms of the sides.

Wait, another formula: OI² = R² - 2Rr, which we know is 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 =13, as used earlier.

Alternatively, OI can also be expressed in terms of the sides as:

OI² = R² - 2Rr

Which we already used.

Alternatively, perhaps using Euler's formula, which is OI² = R(R - 2r), which is the same as above.

Is there another formula that connects OI with the sides?

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates OI² to the sum of the squares of the sides.

Wait, I think there is a formula:

OI² = R² - (a² + b² + c²)/2 + ... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me think about vector coordinates.

Wait, perhaps considering that in triangle ABC, the vector OI is equal to the vector from O to I, which can be expressed in terms of the triangle's centroid G and other centers.

But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities involving the angles.

Wait, since we have angle A, and we know sin A and cos A, perhaps we can relate that to other angles.

We found sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so angle A is arcsin(2 sqrt(30)/13).

Wait, that's approximately, but perhaps we can find cos A.

We can compute cos A using sin²A + cos²A =1.

So, cos A = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169) = sqrt(1 - 120/169) = sqrt(49/169) = 7/13

So, cos A =7/13

So, cos A =7/13

Hmm, that might be useful.

Now, in triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A

So, a² = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13)

So, a² = b² + c² - (14 bc)/13

Hmm, but I don't know a, b, or c.

Wait, but we also have the area Δ =6s, and Δ = (1/2) bc sin A = (1/2) bc*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = bc sqrt(30)/13

So, 6s = bc sqrt(30)/13 => 78 s = bc sqrt(30)

But earlier, we had from 12s = bc sin A:

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, from the area:

Δ = (1/2)*b*c*sin A = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) ) = (b c sqrt(30))/13

And also, Δ =6s.

So, 6s = (b c sqrt(30))/13 => 6s *13 = b c sqrt(30) => 78 s = b c sqrt(30)

So, b c = (78 s)/sqrt(30) = (78 s sqrt(30))/30 = (13 s sqrt(30))/5

Hmm, that's another expression for bc.

But I don't know s yet.

Wait, perhaps we can find s in terms of the sides.

Alternatively, let's think about the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

We have a² = b² + c² - (14 bc)/13.

Also, we know that the area is 6s, and also, a b c = 312 s.

Hmm, so a b c = 312 s => a = (312 s)/(b c)

But from earlier, bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30). So, a = (312 s)/( (78 s)/sqrt(30) ) ) = (312 s * sqrt(30)) / (78 s ) ) = (312 /78) sqrt(30) ) = 4 sqrt(30)

So, a =4 sqrt(30)

Wait, that's interesting. So, side a (BC) is 4 sqrt(30).

So, now, a =4 sqrt(30)

So, from a² = b² + c² - (14 bc)/13

Compute a²: (4 sqrt(30))² = 16*30=480

So, 480 = b² + c² - (14 bc)/13

Also, from the area expression, we have bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30)

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2

So, s = 2 sqrt(30) + (b + c)/2

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, let's express s in terms of bc.

We have bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30) => s = (bc sqrt(30))/78

So, substituting into a =4 sqrt(30):

Wait, a is 4 sqrt(30), which is BC. So, from the semiperimeter, s = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2

So, s = 2 sqrt(30) + (b + c)/2

But also, s = (bc sqrt(30))/78. So,

2 sqrt(30) + (b + c)/2 = (bc sqrt(30))/78

Let me multiply both sides by 78 to eliminate denominators:

78*2 sqrt(30) + 78*(b + c)/2 = bc sqrt(30)

Simplify:

156 sqrt(30) + 39(b + c) = bc sqrt(30)

Let me rearrange:

bc sqrt(30) - 39(b + c) =156 sqrt(30)

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can factor it.

Wait, let's factor out sqrt(30) on the left:

sqrt(30)(bc - 39(b + c)/sqrt(30)) =156 sqrt(30)

Divide both sides by sqrt(30):

bc - 39(b + c)/sqrt(30) =156

Hmm, this is getting messy. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, we have a =4 sqrt(30). Also, from the Law of Sines:

a = 2R sin A = 26 sin A

We found sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so:

a =26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30). That checks out.

So, that's consistent.

Now, from the Law of Sines:

b = 2R sin B =26 sin B

c =26 sin C

So, b =26 sin B, c=26 sin C

So, bc = (26)^2 sin B sin C =676 sin B sin C

Earlier, we had:

From a² = b² + c² - (14 bc)/13

So, 480 = (26 sin B)^2 + (26 sin C)^2 - (14*(26 sin B)*(26 sin C))/13

Compute each term:

(26 sin B)^2 = 676 sin² B

(26 sin C)^2 =676 sin² C

(14*26*26 sin B sin C)/13 =14*(676/13) sin B sin C =14*52 sin B sin C=728 sin B sin C

So, 480 =676 (sin² B + sin² C) -728 sin B sin C

Hmm, that seems complex, but perhaps we can use the fact that in a triangle, angles B and C are related to angle A since A + B + C = 180 degrees.

We know angle A, since we found sin A and cos A.

Wait, cos A =7/13, so angle A = arccos(7/13). Let's compute angle A in radians or degrees, but maybe we can express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.

Wait, since A + B + C = π, so B + C = π - A.

So, let me denote angle B = x, then angle C = π - A - x.

So, sin C = sin(π - A -x )= sin(A +x )

Using sine addition formula: sin(A +x )= sin A cos x + cos A sin x

So, sin C = sin A cos x + cos A sin x

Hmm, but I don't know if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Cosines for sides b and c.

Wait, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for sin B sin C.

Wait, another approach: in any triangle, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2

Since B + C = π - A, so cos(B + C)= cos(π - A)= -cos A.

So, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - (-cos A)] /2 = [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2

We know cos A =7/13.

So, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) +7/13]/2

So, 676 sin B sin C =676* [cos(B - C) +7/13]/2 =338 [cos(B - C) +7/13]

So, let's plug this into the equation:

480 =676 (sin² B + sin² C) -728 sin B sin C

But this seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

We have from bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30). And s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So, s =2 sqrt(30) + (b + c)/2.

So, bc = (78*(2 sqrt(30) + (b + c)/2 )) / sqrt(30)

= (78*2 sqrt(30) +78*(b + c)/2 ) / sqrt(30)

= (156 sqrt(30) + 39 (b + c)) / sqrt(30)

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(30):

= [156*30 + 39 (b + c) sqrt(30) ] /30

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let's re-examine:

bc = [78*(2 sqrt(30) + (b + c)/2)] / sqrt(30)

= [78*2 sqrt(30) + 78*(b + c)/2 ] / sqrt(30)

= [156 sqrt(30) + 39 (b + c) ] / sqrt(30)

Now, let's separate the terms:

= [156 sqrt(30)] / sqrt(30) + [39 (b + c)] / sqrt(30)

=156 + (39 (b + c))/sqrt(30)

So, bc =156 + (39 (b + c))/sqrt(30)

Hmm, so bc =156 + (39 (b + c))/sqrt(30)

Let me denote bc = k, and b + c = m.

So, we have:

k =156 + (39 m)/sqrt(30)

Additionally, from the equation:

a² = b² + c² - (14 bc)/13

Which is 480 = (b² + c²) - (14k)/13

But b² + c² = (b + c)^2 - 2 bc = m² - 2k

So,

480 = m² - 2k - (14k)/13 = m² - (2k + 14k/13) = m² - (26k +14k)/13 = m² - (40k)/13

So,

m² - (40k)/13 =480

But from k =156 + (39 m)/sqrt(30), let's express m in terms of k.

Hmm, but this seems too complicated because of the sqrt(30) in the denominator.

Alternatively, multiply both sides of k =156 + (39 m)/sqrt(30) by sqrt(30):

k sqrt(30) =156 sqrt(30) +39 m

So, 39 m =k sqrt(30) -156 sqrt(30)

Thus, m = (k sqrt(30) -156 sqrt(30))/39 = [sqrt(30)(k -156)] /39

Hmm, so m = (k -156) sqrt(30)/39

So, m² = [ (k -156)^2 *30 ] / (39)^2 = [ (k -156)^2 *30 ] / 1521

So, m² = [30 (k -156)^2 ] / 1521 = [10 (k -156)^2 ] / 507

So, plugging back into the equation:

m² - (40k)/13 =480

=> [10 (k -156)^2 ] / 507 - (40k)/13 =480

Multiply both sides by 507 to eliminate denominators:

10 (k -156)^2 - (40k * 507)/13 =480 *507

Simplify:

10(k² - 312k +156² ) - (40k *39) =480*507

Compute each term:

10(k² -312k +24336) -1560k =242160

Expand:

10k² -3120k +243360 -1560k =242160

Combine like terms:

10k² - (3120 +1560)k +243360 =242160

10k² -4680k +243360 =242160

Subtract 242160 from both sides:

10k² -4680k +1200=0

Divide equation by 10:

k² -468k +120=0

Now, we have a quadratic equation in k: k² -468k +120=0

Let me solve for k using quadratic formula.

k = [468 ± sqrt(468² -4*1*120) ] /2

Compute discriminant D:

468² = (400 +68)^2 =400² +2*400*68 +68² =160000 +54400 +4624=160000+54400=214400+4624=219,024

4*1*120=480

So, D=219024 -480=218544

sqrt(218544)= let's see:

Divide 218544 by 16: 218544 /16=13659

Hmm, sqrt(13659)= about 117, because 117²=13689, which is larger, 116²=13456, so between 116 and 117.

Wait, perhaps 218544 is a perfect square.

Let me factor 218544.

Divide by 16: 218544=16*13659

13659 divided by 3: 13659/3=4553, which is prime? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute 468².

Wait, 468=400+68

468²=400² +2*400*68 +68²=160000 +54400 +4624=160000+54400=214400+4624=219,024

So, D=219,024 -480=218,544.

Wait, maybe 218544= 468² -480= as above.

Wait, sqrt(218544)= let's see: 468²=219024, so sqrt(218544)=sqrt(468² -480). Hmm, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps 218544= 480²= 230400, which is larger, so that's not.

Alternatively, sqrt(218544)= 467.5 approximately.

Wait, maybe I can compute sqrt(218544):

Let me try 468²=219024, which is larger than 218544.

So, 468²=219024

Subtract 219024 -218544=480.

So, 468² -480=218544

So, sqrt(218544)=sqrt(468² -480). Not helpful.

Wait, maybe factor 218544.

Divide by 16:218544=16*13659

13659: let's see if divisible by 3:1+3+6+5+9=24, yes.

13659/3=4553

4553 is probably prime.

So, sqrt(218544)=4*sqrt(13659)=4*sqrt(3*4553). Not a perfect square.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me retrace:

We had bc = k

We had a =4 sqrt(30)

We had the equation:480 = m² - (40k)/13 where m = b + c

From bc =156 + (39 m)/sqrt(30), we expressed m in terms of k.

Then, substituted into the equation, leading to a quadratic equation in k.

But the quadratic equation seems messy, with discriminant 218,544 which isn't a perfect square.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Let me go back.

From bc =156 + (39 m)/sqrt(30)

We had m = (k sqrt(30) -156 sqrt(30))/39 = [sqrt(30)(k-156)] /39

So, m = [sqrt(30)(k-156)] /39

So, m² = [30(k -156)^2]/(39^2) = [30(k² - 312k + 156²)]/(1521)

So, m² = [30k² - 9360k + 30*24336]/1521

Compute 30*24336: 24336*30=730,080

So, m² = (30k² -9360k +730080)/1521

So, plugging back into the equation:

m² - (40k)/13 =480

Multiply through by 1521 to eliminate denominators:

30k² -9360k +730080 - (40k *1521)/13 =480 *1521

Simplify the second term:

(40k *1521)/13 =40k *117=4680k

So,

30k² -9360k +730080 -4680k =480*1521

Combine like terms:

30k² - (9360k +4680k) +730080 =480*1521

30k² -14040k +730080 =480*1521

Compute 480*1521: 480*1500=720,000, 480*21=10,080, so total 730,080.

So,

30k² -14040k +730080 =730080

Subtract 730080 from both sides:

30k² -14040k =0

Factor out 30k:

30k(k - 468 )=0

So, 30k=0 =>k=0, which is impossible since sides can't be zero.

Or, k=468.

So, k=468.

So, bc=468.

So, the product AB·AC= bc=468.

Wait, that's the answer? So, bc=468.

That seems reasonable.

So, the answer is 468.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( AB \cdot AC \) is \boxed{468}.


Given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance between \( O \) and \( I \)**:
   Using the formula \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \):
   \[
   OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13 \implies OI = \sqrt{13}
   \]

2. **Length of \( IA \)**:
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using Pythagoras' theorem:
   \[
   OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}
   \]

3. **Using the inradius and semiperimeter**:
   The formula for \( IA \) is \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \):
   \[
   2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}
   \]
   Using the identity for \( \cos(A/2) \):
   \[
   \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(A/2)} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{130}{169}} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}
   \]

4. **Finding \( \sin A \)**:
   Using the double-angle formula:
   \[
   \sin A = 2 \sin(A/2) \cos(A/2) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} = \frac{2\sqrt{5070}}{169} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}
   \]

5. **Area of the triangle**:
   Using the inradius and semiperimeter:
   \[
   \text{Area} = r \cdot s = 6s
   \]
   Using the sides and angles:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot bc \cdot \sin A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot bc \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = \frac{bc \sqrt{30}}{13}
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for the area:
   \[
   6s = \frac{bc \sqrt{30}}{13} \implies 78s = bc \sqrt{30}
   \]

6. **Solving for \( bc \)**:
   Using the relationship between the sides and the semiperimeter, we find that:
   \[
   bc = 468
   \]

Thus, the value of \( AB \cdot AC \) is \(\boxed{468}\).
