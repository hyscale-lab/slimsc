Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. I know that ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they lie on the same straight line. So the line DEF C is a straight line. Wait, but D and C are both corners of their respective rectangles.

Let me sketch this in my mind. Let's say rectangle ABCD has points A, B, C, D in order. So AB is 107, BC is 16. So AB is the length, BC is the width. Then rectangle EFGH, which I need to place somewhere. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E must be somewhere on the line DC. Wait, but D and C are diagonal points in rectangle ABCD. So DC is the diagonal of ABCD, right?

Wait, that can't be. Because in a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So DC is a side, not a diagonal. Oh wait, no, ABCD is a rectangle, so sides AB and CD are opposite and equal, and sides BC and AD are opposite and equal.

So D is connected to C, which is connected to B. Wait, no, ABCD is a rectangle, so the order is A connected to B, B to C, C to D, D back to A. So the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So DC is one of the sides, but actually, CD is the same as DC, which is a side of the rectangle. So the length of CD is equal to AB, which is 107. Wait, no, because BC is 16, so CD should be equal to AB? Wait, no, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB = CD
