Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and each internal angle is the same. The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, I guess the rectangles are formed by connecting these sides and diagonals.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by selecting pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. But wait, a dodecagon is a 12-sided polygon, which is even, so that should work.

I think the key here is to find all possible pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. Because for a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal and parallel. So, if I can find how many such pairs exist, I can then figure out how many rectangles can be formed.

But wait, how do I determine which lines are parallel? In a regular polygon, sides and certain diagonals are parallel. For a regular n-gon, each side has a certain number of sides it's parallel to, depending on n. Since 12 is divisible by several numbers, like 2, 3, 4, 6, etc., the number of parallel sides and diagonals varies.

Let me think: In a regular polygon with n sides, each side has (n/2 - 1) sides that are parallel to it, right? Because for each side, the sides opposite to it are parallel. So, for a dodecagon, each side is parallel to 5 other sides. Wait, n=12, so each side is parallel to (12/2 - 1) = 5 others. That makes sense because sides separated by 6 positions are directly opposite, but in a 12-gon, each side is parallel to the one 6 apart. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, no, in a regular polygon, two sides are parallel if they are separated by a
