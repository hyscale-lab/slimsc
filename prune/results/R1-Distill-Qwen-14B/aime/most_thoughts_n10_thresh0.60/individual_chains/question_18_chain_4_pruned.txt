Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. 

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a twelve-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle can be calculated using the formula ((n-2)*180)/n, right? So for n=12, it's (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees per internal angle. But maybe the angles aren't too important right now.

The problem is about rectangles. So, in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting four vertices such that the sides are parallel and equal, and the angles are 90 degrees. Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals might form different angles, so how do we get rectangles?

I think the key here is to realize that in a regular polygon, certain diagonals can be parallel. In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is spaced 30 degrees apart because 360/12 = 30. So, if I pick two vertices that are k steps apart, the angle between them from the center is 30k degrees.

For a rectangle, opposite sides need to be equal and parallel, and the adjacent sides should be perpendicular. So, in terms of the dodecagon's structure, this would mean that the sides of the rectangle correspond to two different step sizes, say m and n, such that the diagonals (or sides) corresponding to m steps are perpendicular to those corresponding to n steps.

Wait, but how can diagonals in a dodecagon be perpendicular? I remember that in a regular polygon, two diagonals are perpendicular if the number of steps between their vertices satisfies a certain condition. Maybe something related to their lengths or the angles they subtend at the center.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the coordinates of the vertices. If I place the dodecagon on a coordinate system with one vertex at (1,0), the coordinates of the vertices can
