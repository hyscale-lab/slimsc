Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. And it's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step. So, Alice picks some set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob is creating all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. My goal is to find the sum of all elements in A.

First, let me think about what Bob is doing. For each element a in A, he can create sets B where the maximum is a. So, each such set B would be a subset of the positive integers where the largest number is exactly a.

Wait, so for a particular a, how many such sets B are there? Let's say a is fixed. Then B can be any non-empty subset of {1, 2, ..., a} where the maximum element is a. So, to construct such a set B, we must include a, and any combination of the numbers from 1 to a-1.

So for each a, the number of sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Because for each of the a-1 numbers less than a, we can choose whether to include them or not. Since each set must include a, the number is 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. This is because for each a, we have 2^{a-1} sets, and all these sets are distinct because their maximum elements are different and belong to A.

So, the total number of sets is the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A. And this sum is equal to 2024.

So, mathematically, we can write:

Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

Our task is to find the sum of elements in A, which is Sum_{a ∈ A} a.

So, we need to find a set A whose elements are positive integers, such that when we take 2^{a-1} for each a and sum them, we get 2024. Then, we need to find the sum of all a's in A.

Hmm. So, the problem reduces to finding the set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} equals 2024, and then summing the elements of A.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since 2^{a-1} grows exponentially, the set A is likely to consist of a small number of elements. Let me try to express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2, but each term in the sum is 2^{a-1}, so each term is a power of 2 but shifted by one in the exponent.

Wait, 2^{a-1} = (1/2) * 2^a. So, the sum is (1/2) * (2^a1 + 2^a2 + ... + 2^an) ) = 2024.

So, 2^{a1} + 2^{a2} + ... + 2^{an} = 4048.

Wait, that's 2024 * 2.

So, 4048 is an integer, and we can write it as a sum of distinct powers of 2 because binary representation is unique. So, the sum of 2^{a} for a in A' (where A' is A shifted by 1) would be 4048.

Therefore, A' must be the set of exponents in the binary representation of 4048.

So, let's find the binary representation of 4048.

Wait, 4048 divided by 2: 4048 ÷2= 2024, ÷2=1012, ÷2=506, ÷2=253, which is odd. So, 4048 is 2^5 * 253.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the binary representation.

Let me compute 2^12 is 4096, which is larger than 4048. 2^11 is 2048. So, 2^11 = 2048.

4048 - 2048 = 2000.

2000 in binary: let's see.

2^10=1024. 2000-1024=976.

2^9=512. 976-512=464.

2^8=256. 464-256=208.

2^7=128. 208-128=80.

2^6=64. 80-64=16.

2^4=16. 16-16=0.

So, 2000 is 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 16.

Which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^4.

So, 4048 is 2^11 + 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^4.

Wait, let me check:

2^11 = 2048,

2^10=1024,

2^9=512,

2^8=256,

2^7=128,

2^6=64,

2^4=16.

Adding these together:

2048 + 1024 = 3072,

3072 + 512 = 3584,

3584 +256=3840,

3840 +128=3968,

3968 +64=4032,

4032 +16=4048.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 4048 is equal to 2^11 + 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^4.

Therefore, the exponents are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, but in our expression earlier, 4048 = sum_{a ∈ A} 2^a, where a is each element of A'. Here, A' is the set shifted by 1, because 2^{a-1} comes from a in A. So, our exponents are the a's in A' which are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4. Hence, the original a's in A would be each exponent minus 1. So, A is {10,9,8,7,6,5,3} because 11-1=10, 10-1=9, etc.

Wait, let's see:

Wait, because 2^{a-1} is the term for each a in A. So, if 4048 is the sum of 2^{a} for a in A', then A' is {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}.

Therefore, A is {10,9,8,7,6,5,3} because each a in A is (a' in A') -1.

Wait, let me confirm:

If a' is 11, then a = 10,

a'=10 → a=9,

a'=9 → a=8,

a'=8 → a=7,

a'=7 → a=6,

a'=6 → a=5,

a'=4 → a=3.

Yes, that's correct. So, A is {3,5,6,7,8,9,10}.

Now, let's compute the sum of elements in A: 3 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10.

Let me add them up step by step.

3 +5=8,

8 +6=14,

14 +7=21,

21 +8=29,

29 +9=38,

38 +10=48.

So, the sum is 48.

Wait, but let me double-check that I transformed the exponents correctly.

Because 2^{a-1} for a in A must sum to 2024. So, if A is {3,5,6,7,8,9,10}, let's compute the sum:

For a=3: 2^{2}=4,

a=5: 2^{4}=16,

a=6: 2^5=32,

a=7: 2^6=64,

a=8: 2^7=128,

a=9: 2^8=256,

a=10: 2^9=512.

Now, sum these up:

4 +16=20,

20 +32=52,

52 +64=116,

116 +128=244,

244 +256=500,

500 +512=1012.

Wait, that's only 1012, but we needed 2024.

Uh-oh, that's a problem. It seems I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, so where did I go wrong?

Let me retrace my steps.

We had Bob's total number of sets equal to 2024, which is the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A.

So, Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a−1} = 2024.

I thought that 2^{a−1} = (1/2) * 2^a, so the sum would be (1/2) * Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^a = 2024.

Which leads to Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^a = 4048.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, 4048 in binary is 111111010000, which is 2^12 is 4096, but that's beyond. Let me actually compute the binary representation correctly.

Wait, 4048 is equal to 4096 - 48. 4096 is 2^12. 48 is 32 + 16, which is 2^5 + 2^4.

So, 4096 is 1 followed by 12 zeros in binary.

Subtracting 48 (which is 000000000110000) from 4096 (1000000000000) gives 111111010000.

Wait, let me compute 4048 in binary.

Compute 4048 ÷ 2: Let's do it step by step.

4048 ÷2=2024, rem 0

2024 ÷2=1012, rem 0

1012 ÷2=506, rem 0

506 ÷2=253, rem 0

253 ÷2=126, rem 1

126 ÷2=63, rem 0

63 ÷2=31, rem 1

31 ÷2=15, rem 1

15 ÷2=7, rem 1

7 ÷2=3, rem 1

3 ÷2=1, rem 1

1 ÷2=0, rem 1.

So, writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0.

Wait, let's count the number of divisions:

1. 4048 /2: rem 0

2. 2024 /2: rem 0

3. 1012 /2: rem 0

4. 506 /2: rem 0

5. 253 /2: rem 1

6. 126 /2: rem 0

7. 63 /2: rem 1

8. 31 /2: rem 1

9. 15 /2: rem 1

10. 7 /2: rem 1

11. 3 /2: rem 1

12. 1 /2: rem 1

So, writing from last division to first, the binary is 111111010000.

Which is 12 bits: let's count the positions.

Starting from the right, the first bit is the least significant bit (2^0).

So, 111111010000.

Breaking it down:

Positions (from right, starting at 0):

11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0

Wait, let me index them as positions 11 to 0.

Position 11: 1 → 2^11

Position 10: 1 → 2^10

Position 9: 1 → 2^9

Position 8: 1 → 2^8

Position 7: 1 → 2^7

Position 6: 1 → 2^6

Position 5: 0 → 0

Position 4: 1 → 2^4

Position 3: 0 → 0

Position 2: 0 → 0

Position 1: 0 → 0

Position 0: 0 → 0

So, 2^11 + 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^4.

Which is 2048 + 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 16 = 4048.

Yes, correct.

So, the exponents (positions) where the bits are 1 are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So, the set A' is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

But wait, earlier I thought A' was {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}, but the binary representation shows that the exponents are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So, these are the exponents a' in A' such that 2^{a'} is in the sum.

But since A' is the set of a's such that 2^{a} is in the sum, which is 4048.

Wait, no. Wait, 4048 = sum_{a' in A'} 2^{a'}, so A' is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, no. The exponents where the bits are set are positions 11,10,9,8,7,6,4. So, the exponents are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So, A' is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

But earlier, I thought A' was {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}, but the order doesn't matter because it's a set.

So, A is the set {a' | a' in A'}, which is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, but earlier I thought A was {3,5,6,7,8,9,10}, but that was incorrect because I shifted each exponent in A' by -1, but wait, let's re-examine.

Wait, in the initial analysis, we have:

Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Which can be rewritten as (1/2) * Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^a = 2024.

Therefore, Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^a = 4048.

So, the set A is exactly the set of exponents a in A' where 2^a is part of the sum 4048.

Wait, so A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Because 4048 is the sum of 2^4 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10 + 2^11.

So, each a in A is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, so then the original Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1} would be:

For a=4: 2^{3}=8,

a=6:2^5=32,

a=7:2^6=64,

a=8:2^7=128,

a=9:2^8=256,

a=10:2^9=512,

a=11:2^{10}=1024.

Now, summing these:

8 +32=40,

40 +64=104,

104 +128=232,

232 +256=488,

488 +512=1000,

1000 +1024=2024.

Yes, that adds up correctly to 2024.

So, that's correct. Therefore, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

So, the sum of elements in A is 4 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11.

Let me compute this:

4 +6=10,

10 +7=17,

17 +8=25,

25 +9=34,

34 +10=44,

44 +11=55.

So, the sum is 55.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but that was a miscalculation because I incorrectly shifted the exponents. Now, I realize that A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, so the sum is 55.

But let me double-check the initial transformation.

We have Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a−1} =2024.

We can write this as (Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a}) /2 =2024.

Hence, Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a}=4048.

So, 4048 is the sum of 2^a for a in A.

Therefore, A is the set {a | 2^a is in the binary decomposition of 4048}, which is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

So, the sum of elements in A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.

So, the answer is 55.

Wait, but earlier when I thought A was {3,5,6,7,8,9,10}, I had the sum 48, but that was incorrect because I had miscalculated the exponents.

So, the correct set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, and the sum is 55.

Let me just confirm once again:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2^{3} + 2^{5} + 2^{6} + 2^{7} + 2^{8} + 2^{9} +2^{10}.

Compute each term:

2^3=8,

2^5=32,

2^6=64,

2^7=128,

2^8=256,

2^9=512,

2^10=1024.

Adding them up:

8 +32=40,

40 +64=104,

104 +128=232,

232 +256=488,

488 +512=1000,

1000 +1024=2024.

Yes, correct. So, the sum is 2024 as required.

Therefore, the sum of elements in A is 4 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11=55.

So, the answer is 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The total number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. We need to determine the sum of the elements of \( A \).

For each element \( a \) in \( A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum element \( a \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). Therefore, the total number of sets \( B \) is given by:

\[
\sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{a \in A} 2^a = 2024 \implies \sum_{a \in A} 2^a = 4048
\]

Next, we express 4048 as a sum of powers of 2. The binary representation of 4048 is \( 111111010000_2 \), which corresponds to the sum:

\[
2^{11} + 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^4 = 4048
\]

Thus, the set \( A \) consists of the exponents in this sum, which are \( \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \).

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

Therefore, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
