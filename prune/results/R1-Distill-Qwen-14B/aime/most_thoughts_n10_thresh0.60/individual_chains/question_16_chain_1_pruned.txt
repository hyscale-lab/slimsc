Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared. So, for such a prime p, there exists an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Then, once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Let me think about primes where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p is solvable. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, then maybe that p is a candidate, but we need to check if it can be squared.

I remember that for a prime p, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if 8 divides the order of -1 in the multiplicative group modulo p. The multiplicative group is cyclic of order p-1, so the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if 8 divides p-1. Because the order of x must divide 8, but x^8 ≡ 1 mod p, so the multiplicative order of x must be 8, which requires that 8 divides p-1.

Wait, but actually, more accurately, if -1 is a fourth power modulo p, then p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because the multiplicative group mod p has order p-1, so for -1 to be a fourth power, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution. The multiplicative group mod p is cyclic, so for this to have a solution, the order of -1 must divide (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another approach: Let’s suppose that x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Then, squaring both sides, x^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of x modulo p divides 8 and also divides p-1. So the order of x must be 8, which means that 8 divides p-1. Therefore, p ≡ 1 mod 8. So the primes p for which x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Therefore, the smallest primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8 are 17, 97, etc. Wait, actually, 17 is the first prime after 2 that is 1 mod 8. Because 8*2 +1=17, 8*3+1=25 (not prime), 8*4+1=33 (nope), 8*5+1=41, which is prime, but 17 is smaller.

So maybe 17 is the
