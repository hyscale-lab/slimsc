Okay, so I have this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Alice picks a set A, which consists of positive integers. Then Bob considers all possible finite nonempty sets B where each B has the property that its maximum element is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

So, the key here is figuring out how the size of Bob's list relates to the set A. Let's think about how Bob constructs his list. For each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum element. Each such set B can have any combination of elements from the positive integers less than a, plus the element a itself.

Wait a second, so for each a in A, the number of possible sets B where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a-1}. Because each subset can be combined with the element a to form a set B where the maximum is a. Since the subsets can be any non-empty combination, including the empty set (because if you take the empty set and add a, it's just {a}, which is a valid set B). Wait, actually, no. Wait, the problem says "finite nonempty sets B". So each B must be non-empty, but when we consider the subsets of {1,2,...,a-1}, the empty set corresponds to the set {a}, which is non-empty. So yes, for each a, the number of sets B with max a is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, because the number of subsets of {1,2,...,a-1} is 2^{a-1}, and each subset corresponds to a set B by adding a. So for each a, there are 2^{a-1} such sets.

But wait, but the problem says that Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in A. So if A is, say, {a1, a2, ..., an}, then the total number of such sets B is
