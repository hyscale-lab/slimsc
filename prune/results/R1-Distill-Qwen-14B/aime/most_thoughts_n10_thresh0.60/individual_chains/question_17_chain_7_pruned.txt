Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I know that the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere has to touch the farthest corners of the box, right? So, the space diagonal will be the diameter, so half of that is the radius.

So, if I can find the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in set B, then I can find r by dividing that by 2. Then, r squared would be (diagonal squared)/4.

Wait, but wait, no. The sphere must contain each box, so the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the space diagonal of any box in B. So, the minimal such sphere would have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, divided by 2. So, perhaps the minimal r is half the maximum space diagonal. Therefore, to find r, I need to maximize the space diagonal for boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.

So, the key steps are:

1. Express the space diagonal of a rectangular box in terms of its dimensions.
2. Use the surface area and volume constraints to relate the dimensions.
3. Find the maximum space diagonal given these constraints.
4. Compute r as diagonal / 2, then r squared.

Alright, let's get into the details.

Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, z (length, width, height). 

We know the surface area S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54.

And the volume V = xyz = 23.

We need to express the space diagonal D in terms of x, y, z: D = sqrt(x² + y² + z²).

So, our goal is to maximize D given S=54 and V=23.

Hmm, so to maximize D, we need to maximize x² + y² + z², given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This seems like a constrained optimization problem. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers or maybe apply AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

But since it's a bit more involved, maybe I can set up variables in a way that allows me to express x² + y² + z² in terms of S and V.

Wait, let's remember that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So, from this, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).

We know that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27. Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, if I can express (x + y + z) in terms of known quantities, I can find x² + y² + z².

But how?

We also have that xyz = 23.

Hmm, so perhaps we can let S1 = x + y + z, S2 = xy + yz + zx = 27, and S3 = xyz = 23.

These are the elementary symmetric sums for the roots of a cubic equation. So, x, y, z are the roots of t^3 - S1 t^2 + S2 t - S3 = 0.

But I don't know if that helps directly. Maybe I can relate S1 to other quantities.

Wait, perhaps using the inequality that relates S1, S2, S3. Or maybe using the AM ≥ GM inequality.

Wait, but since we need to maximize x² + y² + z², which is S1² - 54, so to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize S1^2.

So, my goal is to maximize S1, because S1^2 is maximum when S1 is maximum.

So, how can I find the maximum possible value of S1 given that S2=27 and S3=23?

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the function to maximize: f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54,

h(x,y,z) = xyz = 23.

So, the problem is to maximize f(x,y,z) with g(x,y,z)=54 and h(x,y,z)=23.

So, to use Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the system:

∇f = λ ∇g + μ ∇h,

where λ and μ are Lagrange multipliers.

Compute the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z),

∇g = (2(y + z), 2(x + z), 2(x + y)),

∇h = (yz, xz, xy).

So, setting up the equations:

2x = λ * 2(y + z) + μ * yz,

2y = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz,

2z = λ * 2(x + y) + μ * xy.

Hmm, this looks messy, but maybe we can find some symmetry or ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps assume that two variables are equal, like x = y, to simplify the problem. Because, in optimization, sometimes the extremum occurs when variables are equal, or when they take on symmetric roles.

Let me suppose that x = y. Then, let's see what happens.

Let x = y = a, and z = b.

So
