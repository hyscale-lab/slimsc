Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then compute r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, find p+q. Alright, let me break this down.

First, I know that a rectangular box has length, width, and height. Let me denote them as x, y, z. The surface area S of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz). The volume V is given by xyz. So for this problem, S = 54 and V = 23.

So, the given equations are:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

And I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must enclose the box completely. The sphere's diameter must be at least the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the space diagonal is the longest distance inside the box, so the sphere needs to have a diameter equal to that diagonal to just contain the box.

The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d / 2 ⇒ r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, essentially, I need to find the minimum value of (x² + y² + z²) given the constraints on the surface area and volume, and then divide by 4 to get r².

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints:

1. xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

Hmm, okay. So this is an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a symmetric way to approach it.

Wait, but maybe symmetry isn't the way since the box might not be a cube. The volume is 23, which isn't a perfect cube, so it's probably not symmetric. But perhaps the minimal sphere occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible? Or maybe not, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints. Let me recall that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, from this, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz). Since I know xy + yz + xz is 27, this becomes (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, if I can find (x + y + z)^2, then I can find x² + y² + z². Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xyz =23, and Q = xy + yz + xz =27. So, x, y, z are the roots of the cubic equation t³ - S t² + Q t - P = 0 ⇒ t³ - S t² + 27 t - 23 = 0.

But I'm not sure if this helps me directly. Maybe I can use inequalities to relate S and other terms.

I remember that for positive real numbers x, y, z, the following inequality holds:

x² + y² + z² ≥ (xy + yz + xz) * (something). Wait, maybe I should consider AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers because I have two constraints and need to minimize a function. But I'm not too familiar with multivariable optimization, so maybe I'll try setting up the Lagrangian.

Let me define f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which I want to minimize.

The constraints are:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0

h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

So, the Lagrangian would be:

L = f + λ g + μ h = x² + y² + z² + λ(xy + yz + xz -27) + μ(xyz -23)

We can then set up the partial derivatives equal to zero:

∂L/∂x = 2x + λ(y + z) + μ yz = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y + λ(x + z) + μ xz = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z + λ(x + y) + μ xy = 0

And of course, the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27

xyz = 23

So, we have a system of five equations with five variables (x, y, z, λ, μ). Hmm, this might get complicated, but maybe we can find a symmetric solution or find relations between variables.

Let me consider that perhaps two variables are equal, say x = y. Maybe the minimal configuration occurs when two sides are equal, making it a square prism. Let's test this assumption.

Let x = y. Then, the equations become:

From ∂L/∂x:

2x + λ(x + z) + μ xz = 0

From ∂L/∂y: same as ∂L/∂x.

From ∂L/∂z:

2z + λ(2x) + μ x² = 0

So, the first two equations are the same, the third is different.

Let me write down the equations:

1. 2x + λ(x + z) + μ xz = 0
2. 2z + 2λ x + μ x² = 0
3. xy + yz + xz = 27 ⇒ x² + 2xz = 27
4. xyz = 23 ⇒ x² z =23

So, equation 3: x² + 2xz =27

Equation 4: x² z =23.

From equation 4, z = 23/(x²). Plugging into equation 3:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) =27 ⇒ x² + 46/x =27.

Multiply both sides by x: x³ +46 =27x ⇒ x³ -27x +46=0.

Hmm, let's solve this cubic equation for x.

So, x³ -27x +46 =0.

Trying integer roots, factors of 46: 1,2,23,46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0

x=2:8 -54 +46=0→0. Yes! x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor this as (x -2)(x² +2x -23)=0. Let's see:

(x-2)(x² +2x -23) = x³ +2x² -23x -2x² -4x +46 = x³ -27x +46. Correct.

So, the roots are x=2 and x=(-2 ± sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4√6)/2 = -1 ±2√6.

Since x is a length, it must be positive, so x=2, x=-1+2√6≈3.916, or x=-1-2√6≈-5.916 (discard). So possible x=2 or x≈3.916.

Now, if x=2, then z=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75.

Now, let's check if this satisfies equation 1 and 2.

From equation 1: 2x + λ(x + z) + μ xz =0

Plug x=2, z=5.75:

2*2 + λ(2 +5.75) + μ*2*5.75=0 ⇒4 + λ*7.75 + μ*11.5=0.

From equation 2: 2z +2λ x + μ x²=0 ⇒2*5.75 +2λ*2 + μ*4=0 ⇒11.5 +4λ +4μ=0.

So, we have two equations:

1. 4 +7.75λ +11.5μ=0
2. 11.5 +4λ +4μ=0

Let me write these as:

1. 7.75λ +11.5μ = -4
2. 4λ +4μ = -11.5

Let me simplify the second equation:

Divide by 2: 2λ + 2μ = -5.75

Multiply both sides by 1: 2λ + 2μ = -5.75

Now, let's express the first equation:

7.75λ +11.5μ = -4

Let me try to solve these equations. Maybe express λ from the second equation.

From equation 2: 2λ = -5.75 -2μ ⇒ λ = (-5.75 -2μ)/2 = -2.875 - μ

Plug this into equation 1:

7.75*(-2.875 - μ) +11.5μ = -4

Compute 7.75*(-2.875):

First, 7.75 is 31/4, and 2.875 is 23/8.

So, 31/4 * (-23/8) = - (31*23)/(32) = -713/32 ≈-22.28125

Then, 7.75*(-μ)= -7.75μ

So, equation becomes:

-22.28125 -7.75μ +11.5μ = -4

Combine like terms:

-22.28125 + (11.5 -7.75)μ = -4 ⇒

-22.28125 + 3.75μ = -4

Add 22.28125 to both sides:

3.75μ = 18.28125

Convert 3.75 to fraction: 3.75 = 15/4

18.28125 is equal to 18 + 0.28125. 0.28125 is 9/32. So, 18.28125 = 18 + 9/32 = (576 +9)/32 =585/32.

So:

(15/4)μ =585/32 ⇒ μ = (585/32) / (15/4) = (585/32)*(4/15) = (585 *4)/(32*15) = (2340)/(480) = 2340 ÷ 480.

Wait, 2340 ÷ 480: divide numerator and denominator by 60: 2340/60=39, 480/60=8. So 39/8=4.875.

So, μ=39/8.

Then, from equation 2: λ = -2.875 - μ = -2.875 -4.875 = -7.75.

Which is -31/4.

So, we have x=2, y=2, z=23/4=5.75.

So, let's compute x² + y² + z². Since x=y=2, z=5.75.

x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (23/4)^2 = 8 + (529/16) = (128/16)+(529/16) =657/16.

So, r² = (657/16)/4 =657/64. Wait, no. Wait, r = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2, so r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, (657/16)/4 =657/(64). So, r²=657/64.

But wait, hold on. I need to make sure that this is indeed the minimal value. Because I assumed x=y, but perhaps another configuration without x=y could give a smaller x² + y² + z².

But let's see. Let me calculate 657/64. 64*10=640, so 657-640=17. So, 657/64=10 17/64≈10.265625.

Is this the minimal value? Let's think. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when all variables are equal, but since the volume is 23, which is not a cube, perhaps it doesn't.

Wait, maybe if we don't assume x=y, we can find a lower value. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when the variables are equal, but given the constraints, that might not be the case.

Wait, another approach: using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming x=y.

We have the system:

2x + λ(y + z) + μ yz =0

2y + λ(x + z) + μ xz =0

2z + λ(x + y) + μ xy =0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz =27

xyz=23

This is a system of five equations with five variables. Hmm.

Let me subtract the first equation from the second equation:

[2y + λ(x + z) + μ xz] - [2x + λ(y + z) + μ yz] =0

Simplify:

2(y -x) + λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(xz - yz)=0

Which is:

2(y -x) + λ(x - y) + μ z(x - y) =0

Factor (y -x) [or (x - y)]:

(y -x)[2 - λ - μ z] =0

So, either y =x or 2 - λ - μ z =0.

Similarly, subtracting the second equation from the third:

[2z + λ(x + y) + μ xy] - [2y + λ(x + z) + μ xz] =0

Simplify:

2(z - y) + λ(x + y -x - z) + μ(xy - xz)=0

= 2(z - y) + λ(y - z) + μ x(y - z)=0

Factor (z - y):

(z - y)[2 - λ - μ x] =0

So, either z = y or 2 - λ - μ x =0.

Similarly, subtract the first equation from the third:

[2z + λ(x + y) + μ xy] - [2x + λ(y + z) + μ yz] =0

Simplify:

2(z -x) + λ(x + y - y - z) + μ(xy - yz)=0

= 2(z -x) + λ(x - z) + μ y(x - z)=0

Factor (z -x):

(z -x)[2 - λ - μ y] =0

So, either z =x or 2 - λ - μ y=0.

So, from these subtractions, either variables are equal or certain expressions involving λ and μ are zero.

Case 1: All variables equal. So, x = y = z.

But let's check if this is possible.

If x = y = z, then from the surface area:

3x² =27 ⇒x²=9 ⇒x=3.

But then, the volume would be x³=27, but in our problem, volume is 23. So, that's not possible. So, Case 1 is invalid.

Case 2: Two variables equal, and third different. For example, x=y≠z.

Which is the case we considered earlier, leading to x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

Another possibility is x=z≠y, or y=z≠x.

But perhaps the solution we found is the only critical point under the assumption x=y.

Alternatively, perhaps in the general case, some other relations hold.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set up ratios based on the partial derivatives.

From the first equation: 2x + λ(y + z) + μ yz =0.

Similarly for others.

Assume that x ≠ y ≠ z.

Then, from the earlier subtractions:

From first subtraction: (y -x)(2 - λ - μ z)=0.

Since x ≠ y, so 2 - λ - μ z=0 ⇒ λ + μ z =2.

Similarly, from the second subtraction: (z - y)(2 - λ - μ x)=0, since z ≠ y, 2 - λ - μ x=0 ⇒λ + μ x=2.

And from the third subtraction: (z -x)(2 - λ - μ y)=0, since z ≠x, 2 - λ - μ y=0 ⇒λ + μ y=2.

So, we have:

λ + μ z=2

λ + μ x=2

λ + μ y=2

So, subtracting first and second: μ(z -x)=0.

Since μ ≠0 (else from λ +0=2, so λ=2, but then from first equation, 2x + 2(y + z) +0=0 ⇒2x +2y +2z=0 ⇒x + y + z=0, which is impossible as lengths are positive. So, μ ≠0.

Thus, z -x =0 ⇒z=x. But earlier, we assumed z≠x. Contradiction.

Wait, so this suggests that if x ≠ y ≠ z, then we reach a contradiction, which implies that our assumption is wrong. Therefore, not all variables can be distinct. So, at least two variables must be equal.

Therefore, the only possible cases are two variables equal, and the third different.

Which is the case we considered earlier.

So, the minimal configuration is when two variables are equal, x=y=2, z=23/4.

Thus, x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (23/4)^2 =8 + (529/16) = (128 +529)/16 =657/16.

Therefore, r² = (657/16)/4 =657/(64).

Simplify 657 and 64. 657 ÷3=219, 64 ÷3 not integer. 657 ÷2= no, 657 is odd. 657 ÷ 7=94. So, 7*94=658, which is 1 more. Not divisible. 657 ÷ 17≈38.647. Not integer. 657 ÷ 19=34.578. Not integer. So, 657 and 64 share no common factors besides 1. So, p=657, q=64. Thus, p+q=657+64=721.

So, the answer is 721.

Wait a second, but wait. Is there a possibility of a smaller x² + y² + z² with different variables? Because I assumed x=y, but perhaps a different configuration where x≠y≠z gives a smaller sum?

Wait, but earlier deductions showed that in the case where all variables are different, we reach a contradiction, so the only possible configurations are those where two variables are equal. Hence, the minimal sum is indeed achieved when two variables are equal, which is the case we solved.

Therefore, r²=657/64, and p+q=721.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere containing a rectangular box with dimensions \( x, y, z \) is half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \), so \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} \).

Given the constraints:
1. Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \) ⇒ \( xy + yz + xz = 27 \)
2. Volume: \( xyz = 23 \)

We aim to minimize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). Using the identity \( (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + xz) \), we rewrite \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54 \).

Assuming \( x = y \) (to simplify the problem), we substitute into the constraints:
1. \( x^2 + 2xz = 27 \)
2. \( x^2 z = 23 \)

From the second equation, \( z = \frac{23}{x^2} \). Substituting into the first equation:
\[
x^2 + 2x \left( \frac{23}{x^2} \right) = 27 \Rightarrow x^2 + \frac{46}{x} = 27
\]
Multiplying through by \( x \):
\[
x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0
\]
Testing for rational roots, we find \( x = 2 \) is a root. Factoring:
\[
(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x - 23) = 0
\]
The positive roots are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \). Since \( x = 2 \) is the feasible solution, we find \( z = \frac{23}{2^2} = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \).

Thus, \( x = y = 2 \) and \( z = 5.75 \). Calculating \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left( \frac{23}{4} \right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}
\]
Therefore, \( r^2 = \frac{657}{16 \times 4} = \frac{657}{64} \).

Since 657 and 64 are coprime, \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \), giving \( p + q = 721 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{721}
\]
