Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner. The catch is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid means the path has to consist of 8 moves to the right and 8 moves up, right? So the total number of moves is 16, which matches the length given. So each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U).

Now, the problem is about changing directions exactly four times. So, what does it mean to change direction? Well, in a grid path, you can only move either right or up. So changing direction would mean switching from moving right to up or from up to right. So each time you switch between R and U, that's a direction change.

Wait, but the starting direction is either right or up. So, does that count as a direction change? Hmm, the problem says the path changes direction exactly four times. So, perhaps the first segment is either all R's or all U's, and then each time you switch, that's a direction change. So, the number of direction changes would be one less than the number of segments. Because if you have four direction changes, you have five segments. For example, four changes would split the path into five parts.

Let me think. Suppose the path starts with R, then changes to U, then R, then U, then R: that's three direction changes, resulting in four segments. Wait, no, that's three direction changes, but four segments. Wait, yes, each direction change adds a new segment.

So, if there are four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments. Each segment is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's.

Now, since the path must have exactly four direction changes, it must consist of five segments. Each segment is either all R's or all U's. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of such sequences with five segments, where the total number of R's is 8 and the total number of U's is 8.

But wait, the direction alternates each time. Because each change is a switch
