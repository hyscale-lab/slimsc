Okay, so I have this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" integers. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

So, given an integer b where b is at least 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63, which means 6 and 3 are the digits. Adding them gives 6+3=9, which is the square root of 81.

My task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Alright, let me break this down. I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy the two conditions.

First, let's understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. A two-digit number in base b is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero, right? So d1 ranges from 1 to b-1, and d0 ranges from 0 to b-1.

So, n can be written as n = d1 * b + d0. 

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, d1 + d0, equals sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because d1 + d0 is an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

Wait, so n must be a perfect square. Let me note that down: n = k^2, where k is a positive integer. Then, sqrt(n) = k, which must equal d1 + d0.

So our conditions are:
1. n = d1 * b + d0, where 1 <= d1 <= b-1, 0 <= d0 <= b-1.
2. d1 + d0 = k
3. n = k^2

So, substituting n from condition 1 into condition 3: d1 * b + d0 = k^2.

But from condition 2, d1 + d0 = k. So we can write d0 = k - d1.

Substituting this into the equation from condition 1: d1 * b + (k - d1) = k^2.

Let me rearrange this equation.

d1 * b + k - d1 = k^2  
d1 (b - 1) + k = k^2  
d1 (b - 1) = k^2 - k  
d1 = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer in that range.

So, (k^2 - k) must be a multiple of (b - 1). Let me denote m = b - 1, so m = b - 1 >= 1 (since b >= 2).

So, d1 = (k^2 - k) / m.

But since d1 must be an integer, m must divide (k^2 -k). Also, d1 must satisfy 1 <= d1 <= b-1, which is 1 <= d1 <= m.

So, 1 <= (k^2 - k)/m <= m.

Let me write this as:

1 <= (k(k - 1))/m <= m.

Which implies:

m <= k(k - 1) <= m^2.

Wait, no. Because if I have (k(k - 1))/m is between 1 and m, then:

1 <= (k(k - 1))/m <= m.

So multiplying all parts by m:

m <= k(k - 1) <= m^2.

But m is equal to b - 1, and b is at least 2, so m is at least 1.

Hmm, but I think it's better to express everything in terms of m.

So, m divides k(k-1), which is k^2 -k.

So, for a given m, k must satisfy that k(k-1) is a multiple of m.

Furthermore, d1 = (k^2 - k)/m must be an integer between 1 and m.

So, (k^2 -k)/m is an integer in [1, m].

Let me consider that for each m, I can find possible k's that satisfy these conditions.

But since I'm looking for the number of b-eautiful integers, which is the number of possible k's for each m, I need to find m's where the number of k's is more than ten.

Wait, but b is m + 1, so I need to find the smallest b (i.e., smallest m + 1) such that the number of k's that work for m is more than ten.

Wait, no. Because for each m, the number of k's corresponds to the number of n's that are b-eautiful. So for each m, I can find how many k's satisfy the conditions, and then find the
