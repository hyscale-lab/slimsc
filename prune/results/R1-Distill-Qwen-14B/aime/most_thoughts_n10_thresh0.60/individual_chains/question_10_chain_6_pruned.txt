Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers, and then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, Alice picks set A. Then, Bob considers all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of elements in A.

Wait, so for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum. How many such sets B can Bob create for each a?

Let me think. Suppose A has some elements, say a1, a2, ..., an, where each ai is a positive integer. For each ai, the number of sets B where ai is the maximum would be equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, because the elements in B have to be less than or equal to ai, and B must include ai as the maximum. But since B is non-empty, for each ai, the number of possible sets would be 2^{ai - 1}, because each element less than ai can be either included or excluded, except that we must include ai to make it the maximum.

Wait, that makes sense. So if ai is in A, the number of finite non-empty sets B with maximum ai is 2^{ai - 1}. Because for each number less than ai, you can choose to include it or not, but you have to include ai itself. So that's 2^{ai-1} sets per ai.

So the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^{ai - 1} for each ai in A.

The problem states that this total is 2024. So, sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

Wait, so I need to find all possible a in A such that when I sum 2^{a-1} for each a, I get 2024.

But wait, A is a set, so all elements are distinct positive integers. So I need to find a set of distinct positive integers where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is
