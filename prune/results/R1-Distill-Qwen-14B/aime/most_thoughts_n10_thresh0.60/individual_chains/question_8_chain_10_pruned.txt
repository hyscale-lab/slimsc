Okay, I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked. So, I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c equals 300, and another equation involving a, b, and c equals 6,000,000.

The equations are:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me break it down.

First, the first equation is straightforward. The sum of a, b, and c is 300. So, these are nonnegative integers that add up to 300. That part is clear.

The second equation is more complicated. Let me see if I can factor it or find a pattern. Looking at the terms:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor by grouping.

Let me try factoring:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression is a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Now, from the first equation, I know that a + b + c = 300. So, (b + c) is 300 - a, (a + c) is 300 - b, and (a + b) is 300 - c.

So I can rewrite the second equation as:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly for the others.

So the entire expression becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

I can factor the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. Let's write that as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

That's a bit simpler. I wonder if there's a way to express this in terms of symmetric sums or something else.

Wait, I know that for any three variables, a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)² and ab + bc + ca.

Yes, because:

(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

Okay, so substituting back into the equation:

300*(90000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me compute that:

300*90000 = 27,000,000
300*(-2(ab + bc + ca)) = -600(ab + bc + ca)

So, we have:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me rearrange this:

-600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000
Which is:

-600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000

Multiply both sides by -1:

600(ab + bc + ca) + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000

Hmm, so now we have:

600(ab + bc + ca) + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000

I wonder if there's a way to relate this to other symmetric sums. Alternatively, maybe I can
