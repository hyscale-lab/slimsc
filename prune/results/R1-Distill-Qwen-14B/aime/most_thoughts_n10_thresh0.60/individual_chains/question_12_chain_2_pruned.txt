Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits, and it has to satisfy two conditions. The first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, meaning two rows and three columns. Let's label the cells as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So the top row is a, b, c, and the bottom row is d, e, f. 

The first condition says that when we read left to right, we form two numbers. I think that means the top row is a three-digit number, abc, and the bottom row is def, another three-digit number. Their sum should be 999. So, mathematically, that would be:

abc + def = 999

The second condition is about reading top to bottom. Each column is a two-digit number. So the first column is ad, the second is be, and the third is cf. Their sum should be 99. So:

ad + be + cf = 99

Wait, but ad is a two-digit number, so it's 10*a + d. Similarly, be is 10*b + e, and cf is 10*c + f. So the equation becomes:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Let me write that equation more clearly:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I can rearrange terms:

10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99

Factor out the 10:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

So that's another equation:

10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Now, let me summarize the two equations I have:

1. abc + def = 999
2. 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Hmm. Let me think about the first equation. Since abc and def are both three-digit numbers, their sum is 999. So, adding two three-digit numbers to get 999, which is a three-digit number with all digits 9. That suggests that when you add abc and def, there are no carries beyond the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, 999 is the maximum sum for two three-digit numbers, so that's possible only if abc and def are such that their sum doesn't carry over beyond the hundreds place. 

Wait, but 999 is the maximum possible sum for two three-digit numbers (since 999 + 999 = 1998). But 1998 is a four-digit number, so in our case, the sum is 999, which is a three-digit number. That implies that when adding abc and def, there's no carry-over into a fourth digit, meaning that the sum of each corresponding pair of digits (hundreds, tens, units) must be less than 10. Wait, no, actually, that's not necessarily the case. Because 999 could be the sum even if there are carries in the individual digit additions, as long as the total doesn't exceed 999.

Wait, actually, no. Let's think about the addition:

abc
+def
-----
999

Each column (hundreds, tens, units) when added must result in 9 in that place, considering any carry-over from the previous column.

But 999 is the sum, so let
