Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes. Now, they want to know how long the walk takes her in minutes, including t minutes, when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour.

Hmm, okay, so Aya's walk is 9 km each time. The time she takes depends on her walking speed, but she spends t minutes in the coffee shop each time. So the total time for her walk includes both the time she spends walking and the coffee shop time.

I think I can set up equations to model this. Let's see.

First scenario:
- Speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours, which is 4*60 = 240 minutes. But wait, 240 minutes includes both walking time and t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, but maybe it's better to work in hours for the equations because speed is in km/h. Let me try that.

So, when she walks at speed s km/h, the time taken to walk 9 km is (9 / s) hours. Then, she spends t minutes in the coffee shop. But t is in minutes, so I might want to convert that to hours as well. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

Therefore, the total time is (9/s) + (t/60) = 4 hours.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When she walks, the time taken to walk 9 km is 9/s hours. Then she stops for t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So the total time for the walk and coffee is (9/s) + (t/60) = 4 hours.

Similarly, the second scenario: speed is s+2 km/h, walk time is 9/(s+2) hours, plus t/60 hours coffee time, total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.

Wait, no, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours.

So putting that into an equation: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

So, equation 1 minus equation 2: [9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+
