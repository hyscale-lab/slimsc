Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number is a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its two digits equals the square root of the number. 

Let me try to parse this. So in base b, a two-digit number would be something like "d1 d2", where d1 and d2 are digits in base b. That means d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d2 can be from 0 to b-1. The value of this number in decimal would be d1*b + d2.

The key condition is that the sum of the digits, which is d1 + d2, equals the square root of the number. So, mathematically, we can write:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(n), where n = d1*b + d2.

So if I square both sides, we get:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2.

Let me write that equation again:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2.

I can rearrange this equation to group terms involving b. Let's see:

(d1 + d2)^2 - d2 = d1*b.

So,

b = [(d1 + d2)^2 - d2] / d1.

But since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, this fraction must result in an integer.

Hmm. So for each possible digit d1 (from 1 to b-1) and each possible digit d2 (from 0 to b-1), I can compute b as above. But since b is fixed for each problem instance, I need to find for each b, how many pairs (d1, d2) satisfy this equation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to reverse the approach. Instead of fixing b and counting the number of pairs (d1, d2), I can express the equation in terms of d1 and d2, and see what possible b's arise.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to fix d1 and d2, and find the resulting b, then count how many (d1, d2) pairs correspond to the same b. But I'm not sure yet. Let me think.

Wait, no. The problem asks for the minimal b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, which are two-digit numbers in base b. So for each b, I can count the number of (d1, d2) pairs that satisfy the equation. Then, find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

So perhaps the approach is:

1. For each possible base b starting from 2 upwards:
   a. For each possible d1 from 1 to b-1:
      i. For each possible d2 from 0 to b-1:
         - Check if (d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2.
         - If yes, then count this as a b-eautiful number.
   b. After checking all d1 and d2 for this b, if the count is >10, return this b as the answer.

But this seems computationally intensive, especially since b can be quite large. I need a smarter way to calculate how many pairs (d1, d2) satisfy the equation for a given b, without checking each pair.

Let me consider the equation again:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2.

Let me let s = d1 + d2. Then s^2 = d1*b + d2.

But s = d1 + d2, so d2 = s - d1.

Substituting that into the equation:

s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1).

Simplify:

s^2 = d1*b + s - d1.

Bring all terms to one side:

s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1).

So,

d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1).

Since d1 must be a positive integer (from 1 to b-1), (b-1) must divide s^2 - s.

So, for each possible s, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b-1), and the result d1 must be between 1 and b-1.

Also, d2 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b-1, since it's a digit.

So, let's think about possible s. Since s = d1 + d2, and d1 is at least 1, d2 is at least 0, so s is at least 1. What's the maximum possible s? Since d1 can be up to b-1, and d2 up to b-1, s can be up to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.

Wait, but s^2 = d1*b + d2, which is at least d1*2 + 0 (if b=2, since d1 can be 1, d2 can be 0: 81 in base 13 is 6*13 + 3 = 81, but that's an example).

Wait, but more importantly, for a given b, s can't be too large. Because s^2 must be equal to d
