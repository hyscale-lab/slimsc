Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in a list that meets certain conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me list out the given properties of the list:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

Hmm, okay. So the list is of positive integers. Let me think about each of these points and how they constrain the possible structure of the list.

Starting with the mode: since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice, and more times than any other number. So, if 9 appears twice, all other numbers can appear at most once. If 9 appears three times, others can appear at most twice, but since the mode is unique, others can't match or exceed the count of 9.

Next, the sum is 30. So the total of all the numbers in the list is 30. The median is a positive integer not present in the list. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number when ordered. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be an integer not in the list.

Wait, but the median must be a positive integer. So if the median is an integer, that affects whether the list has an odd or even number of elements.

Let me think about the median. If the list has an odd number of elements, say 2k+1, the median is the (k+1)th term. If it's even, say 2k, the median is the average of the kth and (k+1)th terms. Since the median is an integer, if the list has an even number of elements, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, so their average is an integer. Also, the median is not in the list.

So, for example, if the list has an even number of elements, say 4, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements. If that average is not in the list, then the 2nd and 3rd elements can't be equal. Because if they were equal, their average would be that same number, which is in the list. So in the even case, the two middle numbers must be different and their average must be an integer not in the list.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is a single number that isn't in the list. So, for example, if the list has 5 elements, the third one is the median, which isn't present. That's a bit tricky because if the median isn't present, that would mean the third element is a number not in the list. But wait, the list consists of the numbers; the median being not present would mean that the third element is a number that isn't actually in the list. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the list's elements are the numbers, so the median must be one of them if the list has an odd length. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, the median is a value, not necessarily an element of the list. Let me clarify that. If the list is [a, b, c, d, e] with a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e, then the median is c, which must be a positive integer not in the list. But that can't happen because c is an element of the list. So, that suggests that the list must have an even number of elements because only then the median could be an integer not present in the list.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the list must have an even number of elements because otherwise, the median would be
