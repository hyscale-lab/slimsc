Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers that satisfy both equations.

Looking at the second equation, it's a symmetric expression in a, b, c. So maybe I can factor it or find a way to simplify it. Let me see.

I notice that each term in the second equation is of the form x²y, where x and y are two different variables among a, b, c. So, for example, a²b, a²c, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me try to factor it.

Let me consider each pair of variables:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire second equation can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, from the first equation, a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems interesting. So each term becomes a quadratic in a, b, c respectively.

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ to the given sum a + b + c.

I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Maybe that can help me express a² + b² + c² in terms of ab + bc + ca.

Given that a + b + c = 300, then:

(300)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
So 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
Therefore, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Hmm, so if I can find ab + bc + ca, I can find a² + b² + c².

Similarly, maybe I can find a formula for a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other expressions. I recall that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, substituting the known values:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Which simplifies to:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Now, let's go back to the second equation we derived:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting a² + b² + c² as 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca):

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000
300*(-2(ab + bc + ca)) = -600(ab + bc + ca)

So, that part is 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca).

Now, subtract the next term:

- [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = -27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify the terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0.

-600(ab + bc + ca) + 900(ab + bc + ca) = 300(ab + bc + ca).

And then -3abc.

So, overall:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me write this as:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

I can factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's a simpler equation. So, let me write that:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

I can rearrange this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Not sure if that helps, but maybe.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me see.

Alternatively, let me factor out ab, bc, ca:

ab(c - 100) + bc(a - 100) + ca(b - 100) = 2,000,000.

Not sure if that helps either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can factor it as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Let me see if I can write this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps adding 100^3 to both sides to make it factorable? Let me see.

Wait, maybe think of it as a symmetric equation in a, b, c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let x = a, y = b, z = c, but that might not help.

Wait, another idea: since the equation is symmetric, perhaps I can assume some ordering, like a ≤ b ≤ c, and then find possible a, b, c. But since we're dealing with nonnegative integers, and the sum is 300, perhaps it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider variables as a, b, c being such that they satisfy this equation. Let's think about possible substitutions.

Wait, another approach: Let me set s = a + b + c = 300, t = ab + bc + ca, and u = abc.

Then, from earlier, we have:

From the equation 100t - u = 2,000,000.

So, we have:

u = 100t - 2,000,000.

Also, since s = 300, t is ab + bc + ca, and u is abc.

We also know that for three variables, we have the identity:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a).

Wait, no, more accurately, the identity is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) - 3abc.

Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, no, the correct identity is:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca).

Hmm, perhaps that's more useful.

Wait, but we also know that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 can be expressed in terms of s, t, u.

Earlier, I had:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = s^3 - 3 s t
