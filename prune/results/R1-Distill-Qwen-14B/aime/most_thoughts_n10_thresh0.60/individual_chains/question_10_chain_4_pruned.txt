Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, first, Alice picks some set A. Then Bob considers all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Wait, so for each element in A, how many sets B can have that element as their maximum? Let's think about that.

Suppose that A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, where each ai is a positive integer. For each ai in A, the number of possible sets B where ai is the maximum element is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, right? Because for each ai, the set B can have any combination of numbers less than ai, but it has to include ai itself. 

So, the number of such subsets is 2^{ai-1}, since each element less than ai can either be included or not. But wait, no, because the set B has to be non-empty, but since ai is included, the subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} can be any subset, including the empty subset, because when you add ai to it, it becomes a non-empty set. So, for each ai, the number of sets B with maximum ai is indeed 2^{ai-1}.

So, the total number of such sets B is the sum over each ai in A of 2^{ai -1}. According to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So, mathematically, that's:

Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024

We need to find the sum of elements of A, which is Sum_{a ∈ A} a.

So, first, let's figure out what A could be such that the sum of 2^{a - 1} over all a in A is 2024.

Wait, 2024 is a specific number. Let me think about how to express
