Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have a list of positive integers with three properties:
1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let me break this down.

First, what's a mode? The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's the unique mode, 9 appears more times than any other number in the list.

The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, if the median is an integer and not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements because, for an even list, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If those two are different, their average could be an integer not present in the list.

Wait, but if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is one of the numbers, which would have to be 9 since it's the unique mode. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, the list must have an even number of elements. Because if it's odd, the median is in the list, which would have to be 9, but the median is not present. Therefore, the list has an even number of elements.

So, let me note that down:

- Number of elements, n, is even.

- Sum is 30.

- Mode is 9, appears more times than any other number.

- Median is (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th terms' average, which is an integer not present in the list.

So, first, let's think about the number of elements. Let's denote n as the number of elements in the list.

Since n is even, let's say n = 2k, where k is a positive integer.

The median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th terms.

So, median = (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, where a_i are the terms in ascending order.

Since the median is an integer, (a_k + a_{k+1}) must be even, meaning a_k and a_{k+1} are both even or both odd. But regardless, their sum is even, so the median is an integer.

Also, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. So, (a_k + a_{k+1})/2 is not in the list. That gives us a constraint on a_k and a_{k+1}.

Now, since the mode is 9, which appears more than any other number, let's think about how 9 can be arranged in the list.

Given that the list is in ascending order, most of the numbers will be 9, but not so many that the sum exceeds 30.

Wait, but 9 can't be the median if the median is not in the list. Because if the list has a certain number of 9s, their positions in the list will affect the median.

Wait, let me think again. Since the list is sorted, let's say we have n numbers in ascending order. The first few could be low numbers, then perhaps some 9s, and the rest could be higher numbers.

But the median is determined by the middle two numbers. So, for the median to not be in the list, those two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer not present.

So, let's think about possible structures of the list.

Let me also think about how many 9s there need to be. Since 9 is the unique mode, more than any other number. So, if another number appears t times, 9 must appear at least t + 1 times.

So, to minimize the number of 9s, other numbers can appear at most m times, where m is less than the count of 9s.

Now, the sum is 30. So, the total of all elements is 30.

I think I should start by considering possible values of n, the number of elements.

Since n is even, possible n could be 4, 6, 8, etc. Let's try small n first.

Wait, but the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers. So the minimal sum for a list of n elements is n (each element is 1). So 30 must be >= n, so n <=30.

But n is even, so n can be up to 30.

But we need to find the minimal n that satisfies the conditions, or perhaps it's a specific n.

Wait, perhaps the number of elements is such that when we have the two middle elements, their average is an integer not in the list.

Let me try to consider n=8 first.

Wait, n=8: so the median is (a4 + a5)/2, which must be an integer not in the list.

Suppose we have 8 numbers, sorted in ascending order.

Let me try to imagine the list.

Since the mode is 9, we have multiple 9s. Let's say we have m 9s.

We need m to be greater than the count of any other number.

So, for n=8,
