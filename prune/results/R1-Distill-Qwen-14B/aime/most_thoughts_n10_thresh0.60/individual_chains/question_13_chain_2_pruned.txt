Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop after her walk, and the time she spends there is t minutes. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the total time she takes, including the coffee shop time.

In the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour. The total time taken, including the coffee stop, is 4 hours. So that means her walking time plus t minutes equals 4 hours.

In the second scenario, she walks faster, at s + 2 kilometers per hour. This time, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is still including the same t minutes at the coffee shop.

The question is asking, if she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, how long will her walk take her, including the t minutes?

Hmm, okay. I think I need to find the value of s first, and then t, because without knowing her walking speed and the coffee shop time, I can't calculate the exact time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me structure the information:

First scenario:
- Speed = s km/h
- Distance = 9 km
- Total time = 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- This total time includes the walking time plus t minutes.

So, walking time at speed s would be total time minus t. Let me write that as:

Walking time = (Total time) - t
So, walking time = 240 - t minutes.

But walking time can also be calculated as distance divided by speed. Since speed is in km/h and time is in minutes, I think I should convert units to make them consistent.

Wait, maybe I should convert everything into hours or everything into minutes. Let me decide to work in hours because the speeds are given in km per hour.

So, 4 hours is the total time, which includes walking time and t minutes. But t is in minutes, so to convert t into hours, I divide by 60.

So, walking time = (4 hours) - (t / 60 hours)

But walking time is also distance divided by speed, which is 9 km / s km/h = 9 / s hours.

So, setting that equal:

9 / s = 4 - (t / 60)

Let me note that as equation (1):

9/s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert that into hours: 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.

So total time is 2.4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes.

Again, walking time at speed s+2 is (2.4 hours) - (t / 60 hours)

And walking time is also 9 / (s + 2) hours.

So:

9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t / 60)

That's equation (2):

9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Now I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve for s and t.

Let me write both equations again:

Equation (1): 9/s = 4 - t/60

Equation (2): 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

I can rearrange both equations to express t in terms of s, then set them equal.

From equation (1):

9/s = 4 - t/60

So, t/60 = 4 - 9/s

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 60*(4 - 9/s) = 240 - (540)/s

Similarly, from equation (2):

9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

So, t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s + 2)) = 144 - (540)/(s + 2)

Now, since both expressions equal t, I can set them equal:

240 - (540)/s = 144 - (540)/(s + 2)

Let me write that:

240 - (540/s) = 144 - (540)/(s + 2)

I can subtract 144 from both sides:

240 - 144 - (540/s) = - (540)/(s + 2)

Which is 96 - (540/s) = -540/(s + 2)

Let me bring all terms to one side:

96 - (540/s) + 540/(s + 2) = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by s(s + 2) to eliminate denominators.

Wait, let's see:

Multiply every term by s(s + 2):

96 * s(s + 2) - 540*(s + 2) + 540*s = 0

Let me compute each term:

First term: 96 * s(s + 2) = 96s^2 + 192s

Second term: -540*(s + 2) = -540s - 1080

Third term: +540s

So combining all:

96s^2 + 192s - 540s -1080 + 540s = 0

Let's simplify the terms:

96s^2 + (192s -540s +540s) -1080 = 0

Wait, 192s -540s is (192 -540)s = (-348)s. Then adding 540s: (-348 + 540)s = 192s.

So, equation becomes:

96s² + 192s -1080 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me see if I can simplify it by dividing by a common factor.

Looking at the coefficients: 96, 192, 1080.

96 ÷ 24 = 4, 192 ÷24=8, 1080 ÷24=45.

Wait, 96=24*4, 192=24*8, 1080=24*45.

So, divide the whole equation by 24:

(96/24)s² + (192/24)s - (1080/24)=0

Which is:

4s² + 8s - 45 = 0

That's a simpler quadratic equation: 4s² +8s -45 =0

I can try to solve this using the quadratic formula.

Quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c =0, so a=4, b=8, c=-45.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = 64 - 4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 78
