Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there are symmetries that might help in counting such shapes. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides of equal length and 12 vertices, each separated by 30 degrees because 360 degrees divided by 12 is 30. Now, a rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, in the context of a dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must lie along the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

I think the key here is to figure out how many pairs of parallel sides or diagonals exist in the dodecagon because each pair of parallel lines can potentially form the opposite sides of a rectangle. Once I have those, I can count how many rectangles each pair contributes to.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. For example, in a dodecagon, a side connects two adjacent vertices, a diagonal that skips one vertex connects two vertices with two edges in between, and so on.

So, the first step is to figure out all possible sets of parallel sides or diagonals. For a regular polygon with n sides, the number of distinct directions for sides and diagonals is n/2 if n is even, right? Because each side and its opposite are parallel, and each diagonal and its counterpart are also parallel. So, for a dodecagon, n=12, so there are 6 distinct directions.

Let me list them out. For each direction, the step between vertices determines the length and direction. So, the sides are step 1, connecting each vertex to the next. Then diagonals can be step 2, step 3, up to step 5, because step 6 would be the diameter, connecting opposite vertices. Wait, but step 6 is a straight line through the center, so maybe that's a different case.

Wait, so for step k and step (12 - k), they are actually the same lines but in opposite directions. So, for step 1, step 11 is the same line but going the other way, but since direction doesn't matter for lines, they're just the same as step 1. So, perhaps, the number of distinct directions is 6: steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. But step 6 is a straight line through the center, so each of those is unique.

Wait, but in a dodecagon, how many sets of parallel sides or diagonals are there? For each step k from 1 to 6, we have 12 sides or diagonals, each spaced 30 degrees apart. Wait, no, actually, for each step k, you have
