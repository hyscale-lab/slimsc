Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips. I can use some or all of them, but each cell can have at most one chip. So, each cell is either empty, has a white chip, or has a black chip. But wait, no, actually, each cell can contain at most one chip, so it's either empty, white, or black? Wait, no, because each chip is either white or black. So each cell can be empty, have a white, or have a black.

Wait, actually, the chips are indistinguishable except for color. So each cell can have at most one chip, and that chip can be either white or black, or the cell can be empty.

But the problem says "some of these chips," so the grid will have some number of chips, each either white or black, and the rest empty.

Now, the constraints are:

1. All chips in the same row have the same color. So if I look at any row, every chip in that row is either all white, all black, or none. Similarly for columns: all chips in the same column must be the same color.

Wait no, the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." Hmm, so each row's chips are all the same color, and each column's chips are all the same color. So, for a given row, all the chips in that row must be the same color, and same for each column.

Wait, but if a row has chips, they must all be the same color, and similarly for each column. So each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column is either all white, all black, or empty.

But there's another condition: any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So the grid is maximal in the sense that you can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column color constraints.

So, the arrangement is such that every possible cell that could have a chip either already has one, or adding a chip there would cause the row or column to have mixed colors.

So, to model
