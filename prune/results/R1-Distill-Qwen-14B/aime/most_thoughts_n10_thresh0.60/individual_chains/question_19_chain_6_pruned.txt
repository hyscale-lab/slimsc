Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling some basic definitions. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC, so in this case, R = 13. The inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle, which is 6 here. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. IA is one of the angle bisectors, I think, because the incenter lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors.

The key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. That must mean that the product of their slopes is -1 if we put the triangle in a coordinate system, but perhaps there's a better way to approach this without coordinates.

Wait, maybe I can use some known formulas or properties related to the triangle's inradius, circumradius, and the relationship between the incenter and circumcenter.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where O is the circumradius and I is the inradius. Let me check if I remember that correctly. Yes, I think that's right. So, plugging in the values, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Alright, so the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA. Let's see. In triangle OIA, we have OA, which is the circumradius, so OA = 13. OI is sqrt(13), and IA is the length we might be able to relate to other properties.

Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI, so triangle OIA is right-angled at I. So, OA² = OI² + IA². We know OA is 13, so OA² = 169. OI² is 13, so IA² = OA² - OI² = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay.

Now, IA is the length from the incenter I to vertex A. I remember there's a formula for the length of the inradius, but IA is not the inradius. Wait, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I think there's a formula that relates IA to other triangle quantities.

Let me recall. I think IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's semiperimeter, sides, and angles. The formula is IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Alternatively, I think IA can also be expressed as 2R sin(A/2). Wait, let me verify.

Wait, no, let's think. The inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter. Also, in triangle AII, maybe? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps using trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, there's a formula that IA = (r) / (sin(A/2)). Let me check that.

Yes, actually, in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Let me confirm. So, IA = r / sin(A/2). Since we have IA as 2
