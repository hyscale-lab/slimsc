Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. I remember something about sets and Venn diagrams from my math class, so maybe I can use that here.

First, let me parse the problem.

There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal; everyone has them. But then, they can also own other things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, and a garden spade. 

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.

Additionally, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900 people owning that.

Now, the problem also states:
- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.
- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.

And the question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things, which would be the candy hearts plus the three other items.

Hmm. So, the four things are: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Wait, no, actually, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts and possibly some combination of the other three. So, the four "things" are the four items, including candy hearts.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the 900 residents each owns a bag of candy hearts." So that's one item. The other three are diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. So actually, the four items are: 1. candy hearts, 2. diamond ring, 3. golf clubs, 4. garden spade.

But each resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, the other three items are optional.

The problem gives the counts for each of the three optional items:
- 195 own diamond ring.
- 367 own golf clubs.
- 562 own garden spade.

So, to find the number of people who own all four, which would be the candy hearts plus the other three. Wait, no, all four
