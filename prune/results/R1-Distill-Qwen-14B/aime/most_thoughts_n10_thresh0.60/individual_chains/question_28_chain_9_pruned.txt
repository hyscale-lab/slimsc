Alright, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths. The problem is asking about finding the distance from a special point inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point I is such that its distances to all four faces are equal. That point, I think, is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, just like the incenter in a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors meet and is equidistant from all sides. 

So, the given edge lengths are AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). Interesting, so each pair of opposite edges are equal. I remember that in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, it's called a "equifacial" tetrahedron or maybe "isosceles" tetrahedron. I think in such cases, the tetrahedron has some symmetry which might help.

The goal is to find the distance from the incenter I to each of the faces. The problem also mentions that this distance can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, we need to find m + n + p.

I recall that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

Inradius = 3 * Volume / Surface Area

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. In a tetrahedron, the volume is related to the inradius and the surface area. The formula is similar to the 2D case where area = inradius * semiperimeter. In 3D, the volume is equal to (1/3) * inradius * surface area. So, rearranging, inradius = 3 * Volume / Surface Area. Yes, that seems right.

So, to find the inradius, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). Then, plug them into the formula.

First, let's figure out how to compute the volume. Given the edge lengths, perhaps we can figure out the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f, the volume V is given by:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix, but I can see that it's symmetric. But computing a 5x5 determinant is a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps given the symmetry of the edge lengths, the tetrahedron is such that all faces are congruent? Wait, no, because the edges are in pairs. Let me see:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That suggests that the tetrahedron is "equifacial" or maybe "isos
