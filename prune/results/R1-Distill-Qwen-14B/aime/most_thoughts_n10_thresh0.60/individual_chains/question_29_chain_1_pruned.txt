Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the length of CE. Let's see what information I have.

First, there are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that if four points lie on a circle, they're concyclic or lie on a circumcircle. So maybe there's something about cyclic quadrilaterals I can use here.

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. I need to find CE.

Let me try to visualize this. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is 107, which would be the length, and BC is 16, the width. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. FG is 17, so that's one side, and EF is 184, which would be the other side. So, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH =17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I arrange them on a line in that order, it's D-E-C-F. Wait, but I need to confirm the order because sometimes the labeling can be tricky. Let me think.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, the order of the points is typically A-B-C-D-A. So, D is adjacent to C. E is a point on EFGH, the other rectangle, and F is adjacent to E in EFGH. So, the line D-E-C-F suggests that E is between D and C, and F is after C. But wait, if E is part of rectangle EFGH, then F is adjacent to E and G. So, maybe the line is D-E-F-C? Hmm, not sure. Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order is D, E, C, F. So, D is first, then E, then C, then F on the same line.

So, the points on the line are D, E, C, F in that order. So, the distance from D to C is the length of DC, which is AB, which is 107. Wait, no. In rectangle ABCD, DC is equal to AB, which is 107. So, the distance from D to C is 107. But D-E-C-F means that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Wait, but if E is between D and C, then C is after E. So, the total distance from D to F would be DE + EC + CF. But I don't know DE or CF. Hmm.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a
