Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD with some specific edge lengths. The question mentions a point I inside the tetrahedron such that its distances to each of the four faces are equal. That point is called the incenter, right? It's like the 3D version of the incenter in a triangle, where the distances to all sides are the same.

The goal is to find the distance from this incenter to each face, expressed in a particular form, and then sum up m, n, and p where the distance is written as (m√n)/p. So first, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

Given the edge lengths:
- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like the opposite edges are equal. So AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. That might be a clue that the tetrahedron has some symmetry. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron or something? I think in such tetrahedrons, the opposite edges being equal can lead to some properties that make calculations easier.

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius (r) is related to the volume (V) and the surface area (A). Specifically, the formula is similar to that of a triangle, where the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. But in 3D, it's the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the faces divided by 3, I think.

Wait, let me get that straight. In a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / A

where V is the volume and A is the total surface area (sum of all four face areas).

So, I need to calculate the volume of this tetrahedron and the total surface area.

But first, how do I find the volume? I know that for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths, it's not straightforward like the volume of a cube. I think I need to use coordinates or maybe some formula for volume given edge lengths.

Wait, since all opposite edges are equal, maybe I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system in such a way that the calculations become easier.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices A, B, C, D. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can center the tetrahedron at the origin or something.

Alternatively, I've heard of something called the Cayley-Menger determinant which can be used to find the volume of a tetrahedron given all
