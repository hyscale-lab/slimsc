Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, right? Because O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. So OA is 1/2 units long, and OB is sqrt(3)/2 units long. I remember that sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so OB is longer than OA.

The problem talks about a family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment, P is some point (p, 0) and Q is some point (0, q) such that the distance between P and Q is 1. Since they're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

I think each segment PQ can be represented parametrically. Let me try to find a relationship between p and q. Since the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1, using the distance formula:

sqrt((p - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2) = 1

Which simplifies to:

sqrt(p² + q²) = 1

Squaring both sides:

p² + q² = 1

So for any segment PQ in F, the coordinates of P and Q satisfy p² + q² = 1. That makes sense; these are points on the unit circle, but since they're on the axes, P and Q must lie on the intersections of the axes with the unit circle. Wait, no. Wait, if p² + q² = 1, then when p=1, q=0, and when q=1, p=0. But in our case, the points P and Q are on the x and y axes, respectively, so this forms a family of segments from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p² + q² = 1. But these are actually the same as the lines connecting (p,0) and (0,q) with p² + q² = 1, which would be the unit circle, but only along the axes. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, no. Each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² = 1. So each PQ is a line segment of length 1, but not necessarily a chord of the unit circle. Wait, actually, the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1, so each such segment is a chord of length 1 on the unit circle, but since P is on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, these points are on the axes. So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1, so that the distance between them is 1.

Wait, but the equation p² + q² = 1 is the equation of the unit circle. So if P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, they must be points where the unit circle intersects the axes. But the only points on the axes on the unit circle are (1,0) and (0,1). So that can't be right because then all PQ segments would just be the line from (1,0) to (0,1), but that's the only segment in F. But the problem says F is the family of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe p and q are not necessarily 1, but such that the distance between P and Q is 1.

Wait, let me re-express that. Suppose P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q). Then the distance between P and Q is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So p² + q² = 1. So P and Q lie on the unit circle, but also on the x and y axes, respectively. Wait, but the unit circle only intersects the x-axis at (1,0) and the y-axis at (0,1). So that would mean that the only such points are (1,0) and (0,1), making the only segment PQ being from (1,0) to (0,1). But that can't
