Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties and formulas related to triangle centers and radii. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. So, R = 13 and r = 6.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) is given by the formula: OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me write that down.

OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)) = sqrt(13*(13 - 2*6)) = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So, OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, the problem also states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning that angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. That must form a right triangle somewhere.

Let me visualize triangle ABC with O and I inside. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA must be a right-angled triangle at I.

Wait, no, IA is the segment from I to A, and OI is the segment from O to I. So, IA is perpendicular to OI would mean that the lines IA and OI intersect at point I (which they do) and form a right angle there. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

Yes, that makes sense. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, by Pythagoras' theorem, (AI)^2 + (OI)^2 = (AO)^2.

Wait, but AO is the distance from A to O, which is the circumradius, right? Because in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the circumcenter is equal to the circumradius. So AO = R = 13.

So, AO = 13, OI = sqrt(13), and AI is the length from inradius to vertex A. Wait, but AI isn't the inradius; the inradius is the distance from I to the sides. AI is the length from incenter I to vertex A.

I remember that the length of AI can be given by the formula AI = r / sin(A/2). Let me confirm that. Yeah, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex is AI = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, BI = r / sin(B/2), and CI = r / sin(C/2).

So, AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). So, AI squared is (6 / sin(A/2))^2 = 36 / sin^2(A/2).

Now, in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, we have:

(AI)^2 + (OI)^2 = (AO)^2

Substituting the known values:

(36 / sin^2(A/2)) + (sqrt(13))^2 = 13^2

Simplify:

36 / sin^2(A/2) + 13 = 169

Subtract 13 from both sides:

36 / sin^2(A/2) = 156

Divide both sides by 36:

1 / sin^2(A/2) = 156 / 36 = 13 / 3

Therefore, sin^2(A/2) = 3 / 13

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13) or -sqrt(3/13), but since angles are between 0 and 180, sine is positive. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13).

Now, AI is 6 / sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6 * sqrt(13)/sqrt(3) = 6 * (sqrt(39)/3) = 2 * sqrt(39). Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Wait, 6 divided by sqrt(3/13) is equal to 6 * sqrt(13/3). Let me rationalize the denominator:

6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6 * (sqrt(13)/sqrt(3)) = 6 * (sqrt(13)*sqrt(3))/3 = 2 * sqrt(39). Yes, that's correct. So AI = 2*sqrt(39).

But wait, I'm not sure if I need AI for this problem. Let me get back to the problem. I need to find AB * AC.

Hmm, so AB is the side opposite to C, let me denote AB as c, BC as a, and AC as b. So, the sides opposite to A, B, C are a, b, c respectively.

But often, AB is denoted as c, BC as a, and AC as b. So, in that notation, AB * AC = c * b.

I need to find c * b.

Hmm, I know that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area, semiperimeter, inradius, and
