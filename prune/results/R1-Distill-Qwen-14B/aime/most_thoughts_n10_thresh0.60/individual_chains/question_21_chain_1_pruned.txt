Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

Let me try to parse this step by step. 

First, a two-digit number in base b would be something like "ab" in base b, right? Which translates to a*b + b in decimal. Wait, no, actually, in base b, the first digit is the "b's place" and the second is the "units place." So, for example, the number "ab" in base b is a*b + b, but wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that: the value is a*b^1 + b^0, so a*b + 1? Wait, no, actually, it's a*base + digit. So, "ab" base b is a*b + b? Wait, no, that can't be right because if the digits are a and b, then it's a*b + b? Wait, no, the digits can't be b, because in base b, the digits go from 0 to b-1. So the digits a and b in the two-digit number must satisfy 0 â‰¤ a, b < b, but since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero. So a is from 1 to b-1, and the second digit is from 0 to b-1.

So, the two-digit number in base b is n = a*b + d, where a is between 1 and b-1, and d is between 0 and b-1.

The condition for being b-eautiful is that a + d = sqrt(n). So, a + d = sqrt(a*b + d). Therefore, we can write this as:

a + d = sqrt(a*b + d)

If I square both sides, that gives:

(a + d)^2 = a*b + d

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2*a*d + d^2 = a*b + d

Let me rearrange this equation:

a^2 + 2*a*d + d^2 - a*b - d = 0

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

a^2 + (2d - b)*a + (d^2 - d) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So for given b and d, this equation will have solutions for a if the discriminant is non-negative. But since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, this will impose constraints on b and d.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by expressing n as a*b + d, and then the condition is a + d = sqrt(n), which is sqrt(a*b + d). So let me write this as:

Let me
