Alright, so I've come across this interesting number theory problem, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Okay, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m with the same property.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some number theory concepts. I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue mod p² are of interest here. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then p² divides n⁴ + 1.

Wait, but for p² to divide n⁴ + 1, p must divide n⁴ + 1 as well. So, first, let's consider primes p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Then, we can check whether that solution can be lifted to a solution mod p².

I think I should first find the smallest primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. Because if that's the case, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p is solvable, and perhaps we can lift that solution to modulo p².

So, let's recall that in a field like Z/pZ, the multiplicative group is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x⁴ = -1 has a solution in Z/pZ if and only if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/2. Because in the multiplicative group, -1 has order 2, so for x⁴ = -1 to have a solution, 2 must divide the order of the group modulo 4, maybe? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of exponents.

Wait, the multiplicative group is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x⁴ = -1 mod p is equivalent to x⁴ ≡ (-1) mod p. So, in the multiplicative group, we can write -1 as a generator raised to some power. Let me think.

Suppose g is a primitive root mod p, so every non-zero element can be written as g^k for some k. Then, -1 is equal to g^{(p-1)/2}, since (-1) has order 2, so g^{(p-1)/2} squared is 1, so that must be -1.

So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p becomes (g^k)^4 ≡ g^{(p-1)/2} mod p. That simplifies to g^{4k} ≡ g^{(p-1)/2} mod p. Since g is primitive, the exponents must be congruent mod p-1. So, 4k ≡ (p-1)/2 mod (p-1). So, 4k ≡ (p-1)/2 mod p-1.

Hmm, so 4k ≡ (p-1)/2. Let's solve for k: k ≡ [(p-1)/2] * 4^{-1} mod (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1).

Wait, 4 and p-1: If p is an odd prime, then p-1 is even, so gcd(4, p-1) is 2 if p ≡ 1 mod 4, and 1 if p ≡ 3 mod 4. Wait, no: if p ≡ 1 mod 4, then p-1 is divisible by 4, so gcd(4, p-1) is 4. If p ≡ 3 mod 4, then p-1 is 2 mod 4, so gcd(4, p-1) is 2.

Wait, let's see: For p ≡ 1 mod 4, p-1 is divisible by 4, so 4 divides p-1. For p ≡ 3 mod 4, p-1 is 2 mod 4, so only 2 divides p-1.

So, for p ≡ 1 mod 4, the equation 4k ≡ (p-1)/2 mod (p-1) has a solution because 4 and p-1 are not coprime. Wait, actually, for the equation ax ≡ b mod m, a solution exists if and only if gcd(a, m) divides b.

In this case, a=4, m=p-1. So, let's compute gcd(4, p-1):

If p
