Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. So, ABC is a triangle, and ω is its circumcircle. Then, the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Hmm, tangents from a common external point are equal in length, so I remember that DB and DC should be equal because they're both tangents from D to ω.

Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. So, starting from A, drawing a line through D, which is outside the circle, and it intersects the circle again at P. We're given the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The question is asking for AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we need to find m + n.

Alright, so I need to find the length of AP. Let me think about what theorems or properties can help here.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsymmedian point or something related? Wait, I remember that the intersection of tangents at B and C is called the symmedian point, but actually, in this case, since it's the tangents, it's the ex-pole? Hmm, maybe I should recall that DB = DC because they are tangents from the same point D to the circle. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Also, point D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Wait, the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. Alternatively, the symmedian can be thought of as the locus of points whose tangents make equal angles with the sides.

But maybe a better approach is to use power of a point. Since D is outside the circle, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC². And also, since AD passes through P, which is on ω, the power of D can also be expressed as DP * DA. So, power of D is DB² = DP * DA. So, DB² = DP * DA. Which can be rewritten as DP = DB² / DA.

But wait, I don't know DA yet. Maybe I can express DA in terms of other known quantities or relate it through similar triangles.

Alternatively, maybe I can use harmonic division or projective geometry concepts, but that might be overcomplicating.

Wait, another thought: Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, line AD is called the polar of point D with respect to ω. Alternatively, D is the pole of line BC? No, wait, the polar of D would be the line BC because D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, the polar of D is BC.

Alternatively, maybe using inversion. But inversion might
