Okay, so I've got this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50-50 chance, right? The question is about the probability that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Hmm, that's a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me visualize a regular octagon. It has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex is equally likely to be red or blue. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's our denominator for the probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where we can rotate the octagon so that all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. Wait, so if we rotate, the colors of the vertices change positions, but the octagon itself remains the same. So, the idea is that after some rotation, every blue vertex in the original coloring moves to a spot that was red before the rotation.

Let me think about what that implies. Suppose we have a coloring where this is possible. Then, there must be a rotation (by some number of positions) such that the set of blue vertices after rotation corresponds exactly to the set of red vertices before rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of permutation. Each rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices. So, if I rotate the octagon by k positions, each vertex moves to the position k steps away. For the coloring to satisfy the condition, the image of the blue vertices under this rotation must be exactly the red vertices.

Wait, that might not be exactly right. Let me rephrase. If I have a coloring C, and I rotate it by k positions to get coloring C', then the set of blue vertices in C' must be the same as the set of red vertices in C. So, for each blue vertex in C', which is a rotated version of C, it's a red vertex in the original C.

Another way to think about it: the blue vertices in the original coloring must be mapped exactly onto the red vertices by some rotation.

So, for a given coloring, if I can find a rotation k such that the rotated coloring has blue exactly where the original had red, then this coloring counts towards our numerator.

I need to count how many such colorings exist.

Hmm, maybe it's helpful
