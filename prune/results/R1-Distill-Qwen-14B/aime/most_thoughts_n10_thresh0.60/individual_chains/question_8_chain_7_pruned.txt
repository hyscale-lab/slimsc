Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let me try to break it down.

First, let's understand the constraints. We have three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers, meaning they can be zero or any positive integer. The sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated: it's a sum of terms where each term is the square of one variable multiplied by another. So, like a²b, a²c, and so on for each variable.

I think I need to find all possible triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations. Maybe I can find a way to express the second equation in terms of the first one, or find some relationship between them.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at equation 2, I notice that each term is of the form x²y where x and y are different variables. Maybe I can factor or rearrange this expression somehow.

Wait, if I factor out terms, let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So equation 2 can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's better. Now, since from equation 1, a + b + c = 300, we can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c).

So substituting these into equation 2, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me write that out:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, interesting. So that's a sum of three terms, each of which is of the form x²(300 - x), where x is a, b, or c.

Let me denote f(x) = x²(300 - x). So equation 2 becomes f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

Now, let's think about the function f(x) = x²(300 - x). It's a cubic function in x, but since x is nonnegative and less than or equal to 300 (because a + b + c = 300), we can consider x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 300.

I wonder if f(x) has some symmetry or if it's increasing or decreasing in a certain range. Let's find the derivative of f(x) to see its behavior.

But wait, since we're dealing with integers, maybe calculus isn't the way to go here. Alternatively, I can compute f(x) for some values to understand how it behaves.

Let me compute f(0) = 0. f(1) = 1²*(300 -1)=299. f(2)=4*298=1192. f(3)=9*297=2673. Hmm, it's increasing as x increases.

Wait, maybe f(x) increases up to a certain point and then starts decreasing? Let me see. Because for large x, say x=300, f(300)=300²*(0)=0. So it must have a maximum somewhere in between.

To find the maximum of f(x), let's find where the derivative is zero. But since I'm dealing with integers, maybe I can approximate where the maximum occurs.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the value of x that maximizes f(x). Let's compute f(100) = 100²*200 = 10000*200 = 2,000,000.

f(150) = 150²*150 = 22500*150 = 3,375,000.

f(200) = 200²*100 = 40000*100=4,000,000.

f(250)=250²*50=62500*50=3,125,000.

Hmm, so f(200)=4,000,000, which is larger than f(150)=3,375,000 and f(250)=3,125,000. So the maximum is at x=200.

Wait, f(200)=4,000,000. Interesting. So the maximum of f(x) is 4,000,000 at x=200.

Wait, but the sum f(a) + f(b) + f(c) is 6,000,000. So each of a, b, c can contribute up to 4,000,000, but the sum is 6,000,000.

So, if each of a, b, c can contribute up to 4,000,000, but the sum is 6,000,000, that suggests that perhaps two of them are at the maximum, but let's see.

Wait, but 4,000,000 * 2 = 8,000,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So maybe two variables are around 200, or perhaps one is 200 and the others are lower.

But since a + b + c = 300, if one variable is 200, the sum of the other two is 100.

Wait, so suppose a=200, then b + c=100. Then f(a)=200² * (300 - 200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000.

Then f(b) + f(c) would need to be 2,000,000.

But with b + c=100, how much can f(b) + f(c) be?

The maximum of f(b) + f(c) when b + c=100.

Wait, if b=100, c=0, then f(b)=100²*200=2,000,000 and f(c)=0. So f(b) + f(c)=2,000,000.

Similarly, if b=50 and c=50, then f(50)=2500 * 250=625,000 each, so total 1,250,000.

Wait, so when a=200, and b=100, c=0, the total is 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. That works.

Similarly, if a=200, and b=0, c=100, same result.

But wait, are there other possibilities where a=200, and b and c are other numbers adding to 100,
