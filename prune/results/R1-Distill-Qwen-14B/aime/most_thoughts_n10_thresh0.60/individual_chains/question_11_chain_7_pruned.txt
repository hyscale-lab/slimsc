Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. The problem is to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions involving z and 1/z, it's often helpful to express z in polar form. Since the magnitude of z is given as 4, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then 1/z would just be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, right?

So, let me try substituting z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression. Then, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) / (4e^{iθ})

Simplifying each term:

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (96/4 + 144i/4) * e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}

So the entire expression is:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + 24*(1 + 1.5i)*e^{-iθ}

Wait, 24 + 36i can be written as 24(1 + 1.5i), right? But maybe it's better to keep it as 24 + 36i for now.

Now, to compute the real part of this expression, I need to calculate the real parts of both terms and add them together.

Let me denote the first term as A = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}, and the second term as B = (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

Calculating the real part of A: Re(A) = 4*(75 + 117i) * Re(e^{iθ}) = 4*(75 + 117i) * cosθ.

Similarly, Re(B) = (24 + 36i) * Re(e^{-iθ}) = (24 + 36i) * cosθ, because Re(e^{-iθ}) is cosθ.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, when you have a complex number multiplied by e^{iθ}, the real part is the dot product of the complex number with e^{iθ}'s real part. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Let me recall Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So, when we multiply a complex number a + ib by e^{iθ}, it's equivalent to rotating the complex number by θ radians.

So, the first term A is 4*(75 + 117i) multiplied by e^{iθ}. Let me compute this multiplication.

Let me represent 75 + 117i as a vector in the complex plane. So, A becomes 4*(75 + 117i) rotated by θ. Similarly, B is (24 + 36i) rotated by -θ.

But maybe it's better to express everything in terms of cosθ and sinθ. Let's try expanding both A and B.

So, A = 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 4*[75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i^2 sinθ]
= 4*[75 cosθ + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ) - 117 sinθ]
= 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + 4i*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)

Similarly, B = (24 + 36i)*(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + i*(36 cosθ - 24 sinθ) + 36 sinθ
= (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i*(36 cosθ - 24 sinθ)

So, the real part of the entire expression is Re(A) + Re(B):

Re(A) = 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ)
Re(B) = (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
So total real part = 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)

Let me compute that:

= 4*75 cosθ - 4*117 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Now, the problem is to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

Hmm, okay, so I have an expression of the form C cosθ + D sinθ, which can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(C² + D²), and φ is some phase shift.

Wait, actually, the standard form is A cosθ + B sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A² + B²) and tanφ = B/A. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as R sin(theta + something), depending on the phase.

Wait, in any case, the maximum
