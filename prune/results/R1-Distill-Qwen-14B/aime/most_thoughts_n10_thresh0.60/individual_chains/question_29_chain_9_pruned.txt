Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, maybe some cyclic quadrilateral properties will come into play here.

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let's try to visualize or sketch the problem. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me think about how these points might lie on a line. Since D and C are corners of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are corners of EFGH, their positions must be such that E is somewhere between D and C, and F is next to E. Wait, but the order could be D, E, C, F or D, E, F, C, I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should consider both possibilities.

Wait, no. Since ABCD is a rectangle, D is connected to C and A. EFGH is another rectangle. So, if D and C are points on one rectangle, and E and F are points on another, and they are collinear in the order D, E, C, F, that might make sense. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's D, E, F, C. Hmm.

But let's see. Since E is a corner of EFGH, which is a rectangle. So, E is connected to F and G. Hmm. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order is D-E-C-F on a straight line. So, that would mean that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or is it the other way
