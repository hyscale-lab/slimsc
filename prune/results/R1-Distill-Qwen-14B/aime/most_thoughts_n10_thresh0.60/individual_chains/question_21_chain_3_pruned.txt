Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n.

Let me try to break this down. So, if n is a two-digit number in base b, that means it can be expressed as n = a*b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero, so a must be at least 1. Also, in any base b, each digit must be less than b, so a can be from 1 to b-1, and c can be from 0 to b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits a and c equals the square root of n. So, mathematically, that would be a + c = sqrt(n). But since n is equal to a*b + c, we can substitute that in: a + c = sqrt(a*b + c).

Hmm, so let me write that equation down:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

If I square both sides to eliminate the square root, I get:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange everything to one side to see if I can simplify:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can group terms in a way that factors nicely. Let me see:

Looking at the terms involving a:

a^2 + 2ac - a*b

And the terms involving c:

c^2 - c

So, combining these:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + c^2 - c = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me write it as:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Now, since a has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c has to be between 0 and b-1, I can think of this as a quadratic in a, and for each possible c, we can try to find integer solutions for a.

Alternatively, maybe we can approach this by considering that n is a perfect square because sqrt(n) has to be an integer since a and c are integers and their sum is sqrt(n). So, n must be a perfect square, which makes sense because sqrt(n) is an integer.

Wait, let me think. The problem statement says that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 is 6*13 + 3 = 81, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). So, n must be a perfect square, yes.

So, n = k^2, where k is a positive integer, and n = a*b + c. Also, a + c = k.

So, let me express this:

n = k^2 = a*b + c

and

k = a + c

So, substituting c = k - a into the first equation:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a)

Simplifying:

k^2 = a*b + k - a

Let me rearrange terms:

k^2 - k = a*b - a

Factor out a on the right:

k^2 - k = a*(b - 1)

So, a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

But a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, so (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1.

Hmm, so for each k, we can compute a as (k^2 - k)/(b - 1), and if this is an integer within the required range, then n = k^2 is a b-eautiful number.

But wait, I'm trying to find for each b, how many such n exist. I need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.

Alternatively, maybe I can express b in terms of a and k. Let's see:

From the equation:

k^2 - k = a*(b - 1)

So, b = (k^2 - k)/a + 1

But since
