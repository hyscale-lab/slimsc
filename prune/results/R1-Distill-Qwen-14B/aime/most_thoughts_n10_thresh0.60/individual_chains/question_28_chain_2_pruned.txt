Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem. Let me try to picture it in my mind. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so it seems like the opposite edges are equal. That might mean the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way. 

The question is asking about a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter (which is the point equidistant from all faces) is the center of the inscribed sphere. So, I is the incenter, and the distance we're looking for is the inradius.

To find the inradius, I think the formula involves the volume of the tetrahedron and the sum of the areas of its faces. The formula is something like inradius r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.

First, let's tackle the surface area. Since all the edges are given, maybe I can find the area of each triangular face. Each face is a triangle with sides given by the edges of the tetrahedron. Let me list the faces:

1. Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC. So, AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80).
2. Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD. AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89).
3. Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD. AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89).
4. Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD. BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80).

So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, no, actually each face has three edges, but the specific edges vary. Let me check one face first.

Take face ABC: AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80). Hmm, let me see if this is a right triangle. Let's square the sides: 41, 89, 80. Does 41 + 80 = 89? 41 + 80 is 121, which is 11^2, but 89 is less than that. So, no, it's not a right triangle. Alternatively, maybe another combination. 41 + 89 is 130, which is not equal to 80, so that's not a right triangle either. So, I can't use the simple base-height formula; I need to use Heron's formula for each face.

Heron's formula says that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter, (a + b + c)/2.

So, let's compute the area of face ABC. The sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me compute the semi-perimeter s.

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.

Wait, but this might get complicated with all the square roots. Maybe I can square the semi-perimeter and the terms to compute the area? Alternatively, maybe there's a better way since all faces are congruent in some way.

Wait, looking back, each face has two edges of sqrt(41) and sqrt(89), but wait, actually no. Let me see:

Wait, for face ABC, sides are AB=sqrt(41), BC=sqrt(89), AC=sqrt(80).

Face ABD: AB=sqrt(41), BD=sqrt(80), AD=sqrt(89).

Face ACD: AC=sqrt(80), CD=sqrt(41), AD=sqrt(89).

Face BCD: BC=sqrt(89), CD=sqrt(41), BD=sqrt(80).

So, each face has sides of sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, they are all congruent triangles. That's interesting. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, their areas will be the same. That's a big help.

So, if I can compute the area of one face, I can multiply by four to get the total surface area.

Let's compute the area of face ABC. Using Heron's formula:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, we can find the area squared, which is s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c), and then take the square root. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the area using vectors or coordinates.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to assign coordinates to the vertices of the tetrahedron so that we can compute the volume and areas more easily. Since the tetrahedron has equal opposite edges, it might be a "isohedral" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be a tetrahedron that's symmetric in a way that makes it easier to assign coordinates.

Let me try assigning coordinates. Let's place the tetrahedron in 3D space. Let me suppose that point A is at (0, 0, 0). Let me assign point B at (x, 0, 0). Then, point C can be at (p, q, 0), and point D at (r, s, t). Hmm, but this might get
