Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n / p, and then I have to find m + n + p. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, if all the opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron. So in this case, AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. That might mean that the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, which could help in calculations.

I also recall that the point I, which is equidistant from all four faces, is called the incenter of the tetrahedron. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. To find this, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces). The formula for the inradius r is volume divided by (1/3) times the total surface area, right? So r = 3V / A_total, where V is the volume and A_total is the sum of the areas of the four faces.

So my steps should be:
1. Find the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD.
2. Find the areas of each of the four faces.
3. Sum the areas to get A_total.
4. Plug into the formula r = 3V / A_total.

Let me start with the first step: finding the volume. Since the tetrahedron is isosceles, maybe I can use a formula specific to such tetrahedrons. I think for an isosceles tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / (6 * sqrt(2))

Wait, no, that seems more like Heron's formula for a triangle. Maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be considered as two congruent triangles in some sense, but I'm not sure.

Another idea is to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to make calculations easier. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices such that the calculations are symmetric.

Let me denote the coordinates as follows:
- Let’s place vertex A at (x, y, z)
- Similarly, I can assign coordinates to B, C, D such that opposite edges are equal.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use vectors or coordinates in a way that the midpoints and centroids align, given
