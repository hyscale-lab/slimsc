Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. I'm going to tackle each property one by one and see how they fit together.

First, the list consists of positive integers. That's a good starting point because all numbers are at least 1. The sum is 30, which gives me a total to work with. The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list, and no other number shares that highest frequency. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because the median is usually an actual value in the list, but in this case, it's an integer that's not in the list.

Let me think about the median first because that might help determine the structure of the list. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. For a list with an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. For an even number of elements, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But since the median is a positive integer not in the list, it must be that the average of the two middle numbers is an integer not present in the list.

Wait, so if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be an integer but not present in the list. So, that tells me that the two middle numbers must be consecutive even or odd numbers? Because their average would then be a half-integer, but the problem states the median is a positive integer, so that can't be. Therefore, the two middle numbers must both be even or both be odd to make their average an integer.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. If the two middle numbers are, say, 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer. So, in that case, the median is 9, which is the unique mode. But wait, the unique mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. If the median is 9, which is the mode, but the problem states that the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So, that can't be the case. Therefore, the median can't be 9 because 9 is in the list as the mode.

So, the median must be another integer. Let's suppose the list has an odd number of elements. Then, the median would be the middle number, which would have to be a number not in the list. But wait, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is one of the numbers
