Okay, so I have this math problem here from Aimeville. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, there are 900 residents in Aimeville. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Additionally, every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, four items in total: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Wait, actually, the candy hearts are mentioned as something everyone owns, so maybe it's not an additional item but rather something that's included in the count.

Hmm, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universalâ€”everyone has them. So, we're dealing with four items, but since everyone has candy hearts, the only way someone doesn't have all four is if they are missing one or more of the other three.

The problem also states that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. We need to find the number of residents who own all four.

Wait, let me clarify: the four things are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has candy hearts, the other three are the ones where people might not have them. So, when the problem refers to owning exactly two or three things, does that include the candy hearts or not?

Hmm, actually, the way it's worded: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, candy hearts are a given. So, when it says 195 own a diamond ring, that includes those who also own candy hearts, right? So, perhaps the four sets are: D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts, which is everyone). But since C is universal, perhaps we can model this with three sets D, G, S, and a universal set for C.

But maybe it's better to model it with four sets, considering C as a fourth set. Let me think.

Wait, let's model it using the principle of inclusion
