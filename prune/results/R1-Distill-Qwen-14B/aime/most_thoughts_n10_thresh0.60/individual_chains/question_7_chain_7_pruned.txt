Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation which turns all the blue vertices into positions where there were originally red vertices, and vice versa. Hmm. Let me try to unpack this.

First, I think I need to consider all possible colorings of the octagon. Since each vertex can be either red or blue, there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. Each coloring is equally likely, with probability 1/256. So the probability we're looking for is the number of colorings that satisfy the given condition divided by 256.

The condition is that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up where red vertices were originally, and all red vertices end up where blue vertices were. Wait, is that correct? Let me read again: "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So after rotation, every blue vertex is now in a position that was red before the rotation.

So, more precisely, if I have a coloring, and I rotate it by some number of steps (since it's a regular octagon, the rotations are by multiples of 45 degrees, corresponding to shifting each vertex by 0,1,2,...,7 positions), then in the rotated coloring, every blue vertex in the original must be on a red vertex in the original. Similarly, every red vertex must be on a blue vertex, right? Because it's a permutation.

So, in other words, the coloring must be such that there exists a rotation that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. Which would imply that the number of blue vertices is equal to the number of red vertices, because the rotation is a bijection. So, first off, the coloring must have exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, let me see: in an octagon, any rotation is a permutation of the vertices. So if the number of blue vertices isn't equal to the number of red vertices, then after any rotation, the number of blue vertices would still be the same. So, we need the number of blue vertices to be equal to red vertices, which means exactly 4 blues and 4 reds.

So, the first step is to note that only colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices can satisfy this condition. So the total number of such colorings is C(8,4) = 70. So, the probability is going to be the number of valid colorings divided by 70.

Wait, no, the total number of colorings is 256. But we're only considering colorings where exactly 4 are blue and 4 are red. So, the probability we're looking for is (number of valid colorings with 4 blue and 4 red) divided by 256.

But perhaps it's better to compute the probability as (number of such colorings with 4 blue and 4 red that satisfy the condition) divided by 256.

Alternatively, since all colorings are equally likely, and only those with exactly 4 blue and 4 red can satisfy the condition, maybe we can compute the probability as [number of valid color
