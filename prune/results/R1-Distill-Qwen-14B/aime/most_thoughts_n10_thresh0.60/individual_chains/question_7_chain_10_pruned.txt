Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so each has a 50% chance of being red or blue. The question is about the probability that the octagon can be rotated in such a way that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm. Let's see. So, first, I need to understand what it means for the octagon to be rotatable such that all blue vertices map to red ones. That sounds like a rotational symmetry condition where the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, if I can rotate the octagon by some number of positions and have all the blues align with the reds, then the condition is satisfied.

Since it's a regular octagon, it has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., up to 315째. Each rotation corresponds to shifting the vertices by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions respectively. So, for each coloring, we need to check if there's a rotation where every blue vertex moves to a red vertex's original position.

Wait, but each vertex is colored independently, so the colorings are random. The problem is to find the probability that such a rotation exists.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe it's helpful to think in terms of group theory or combinatorics. The octagon's rotation group is cyclic of order 8, so the rotations form a group under composition. The problem is essentially asking for colorings where the blue set is a translate (rotation) of the red set.

Alternatively, since each vertex is colored either red or blue, the entire coloring can be thought of as a subset of the octagon's vertices (the blue ones) and its complement (the red ones). So, we need the blue subset to be a cyclic shift of the red subset.

Wait, but the red subset is just the complement of the blue subset. So, for the blue subset to be a cyclic shift of the red subset, it must satisfy that the blue set is equal to some rotation of the red set, which is the same as saying that the blue set is equal to some rotation of its own complement.

So, if B is the set of blue vertices, then B must be equal to r(B'), where r is a rotation, and B' is the complement of B. But since B' is the set of red vertices, r(B') is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but if B is equal to r(B'), then r(B') = B. So, the set of reds rotated by r gives the blues. So, for each coloring, we're looking for a rotation that maps reds to blues.

Another way to think about it: For each coloring, we need that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

So, the condition is that the blue set is a rotation of the red set. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set, and then dividing by the total number of color
