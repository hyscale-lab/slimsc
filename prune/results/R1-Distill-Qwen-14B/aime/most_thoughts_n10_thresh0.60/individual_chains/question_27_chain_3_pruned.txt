Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is in the same plane as the circle but 6 units away from the center of the circle. So the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the circle is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and it can also rest outside the sphere and be tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The problem is asking for the difference r_i - r_o, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I need to figure out the radii of these tangent circles for both internal and external tangency. Let me think about what these configurations look like.

First, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. That means the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on internal or external. Wait, no, in the case of internal tangent, the distance between centers is equal to the difference of radii, and for external tangent, it's the sum. But wait, in this case, the torus is a surface, not a solid sphere. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, actually, the torus is a surface, but when it's inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus has a certain size. The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. So perhaps I need to model this geometrically.

Let me recall that a torus can be described in 3D space with two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In our case, R is 6, and r is 3
