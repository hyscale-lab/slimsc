Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract a fraction, then take the absolute value again. That probably means their graphs will have some V-shape or maybe multiple V-shapes because of the nested absolute values.

Let me first sketch or visualize f(x) and g(x) individually.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner |x| makes it symmetric about the y-axis. Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2 unit, and the outer absolute value will reflect any negative part back up. So, what does this look like?

For f(x), the expression inside the outer absolute value is |x| - 1/2. So when |x| >= 1/2, this is non-negative, and the absolute value doesn't change it. When |x| < 1/2, this becomes negative, so the outer absolute value reflects it up. So f(x) is a V-shaped graph that has a V at x = 0, but it's shifted and maybe has a minimum or maximum.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute some specific values.

When x = 0: |0| = 0, so f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

When x = 1/2: |1/2| = 1/2, so f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.

Similarly, when x = -1/2: same as above, f(-1/2) = 0.

When x = 1: |1| =1, so f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

So f(x) has a minimum of 0 at x = ±1/2 and goes up to 1/2 as x approaches 0 or beyond ±1.

So f(x) is a V-shape with its vertex at (0, 1/2), dipping down to 0 at x = ±1/2.

Similarly for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

At x = 0: |0| =0, so g(0)= |0 - 1/4|=1/4.

At x=1/4: |1/4| =1/4, so g(1/4)=0.

Similarly, x=-1/4: same.

x=1/2: |1/2|=1/2, so g(1/2)=|1/2 -1/4|=1/4.

So g(x) is also V-shaped with vertex at (0, 1/4), dipping down to 0 at x=±1/4.

Wait, so f(x) and g(x) both have similar shapes but different scales.

So, f(x) has a dip to 0 at ±1/2, while g(x) dips to 0 at ±1/4.

Now, let's think about the composition of functions.

We have y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x =4g(f(cos(3πy))). So both y and x are defined in terms of these composed functions.

I need to find their points of intersection, which means solving for (x,y) where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x =4g(f(cos(3πy))), and y is also a function of x.

Wait, but in the second equation, x is expressed as a function of y, which complicates things. So it's a system of equations where each is a function of the other variable.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can try to express everything in terms of one variable, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible ranges of the functions and figure out how many times they intersect.

Let me first analyze the range of the functions involved.

First, the innermost functions: sin(2πx) and cos(3πy). Both sin and cos functions have outputs in [-1,
