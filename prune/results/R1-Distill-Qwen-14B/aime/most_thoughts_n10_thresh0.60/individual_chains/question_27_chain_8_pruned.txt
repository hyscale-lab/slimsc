Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

We have a torus T, which is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the same plane as the circle. The distance from the center of the circle to this axis is 6 units. So, it's like a donut shape. Then there's a sphere S with radius 11.

The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When T rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is understanding how the torus and sphere can be tangent to each other in these two scenarios—internally and externally. Let me visualize both cases.

First, let's recall the properties of a torus. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this problem, R is 6 and r is 3.

So, the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. The sphere has radius 11.

Now, when the torus is placed inside the sphere and tangent internally, I imagine the torus sitting inside the sphere such that they touch at exactly one circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they touch externally.

I think the key is to find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus in each case and then relate that to the radii of the tangent circles.

Wait, but the torus is a surface of revolution. So, perhaps I should model the torus mathematically. The standard equation for a torus is in 3D, but maybe I can think in terms of its cross-sectional circle.

Let me think—when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere will touch the outer part of the torus. Conversely, when the torus is outside, the sphere will touch the inner part of the torus.

Wait, no. Actually, when T is inside S, it's resting on the inside of S, so the sphere is larger, and the torus is inside. So, the sphere's surface is outside the torus. Therefore, the point of tangency would be on the outer part of the torus. Similarly, when T is outside S, meaning the torus is larger and wraps around the sphere, the sphere is inside, so the point of tangency is on the inner part of the torus.

Wait, maybe I should think about the centers. The sphere is fixed, right? So, when T is inside S, the center of T must be closer to the center of S, and when it's outside, the
