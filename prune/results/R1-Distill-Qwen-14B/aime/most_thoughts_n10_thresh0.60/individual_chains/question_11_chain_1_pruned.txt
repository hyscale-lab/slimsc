Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, when you have expressions like this, it's often useful to express z in polar form since we know its magnitude is 4. So maybe I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier to handle, especially since we're dealing with both z and 1/z.

So if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}. That makes sense because |1/z| is 1/|z|, which is 1/4 here. So let me substitute these into the expression.

The expression becomes:
(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately. First, calculate (75 + 117i) * 4. 75 * 4 is 300, and 117 * 4 is 468. So that term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Next, compute (96 + 144i) * (1/4). 96 divided by 4 is 24, and 144 divided by 4 is 36. So that term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So putting it all together, the expression is:
(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression and maximize it. Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. So the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

To find the real part, I can use Euler's formula, which says that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, expanding each term:
A e^{iθ} = A cosθ + i A sinθ
B e^{-iθ} = B cosθ - i B sinθ

Adding them together:
Real part: (A cosθ + B cosθ) = (A + B) cosθ
Imaginary part: (A sinθ - B sinθ) = (A - B) sinθ

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because A and B are complex numbers, not real numbers. So I can't just directly add A and B like that.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the real parts and imaginary parts separately. Let's let A = a + bi and B = c + di.

So A = 300 + 468i, so a = 300, b = 468
B = 24 + 36i, so c = 24, d = 36

Then,
A e^{iθ} = (a + bi)(cosθ + i sinθ) = a cosθ - b sinθ + i (a sinθ + b cosθ)
Similarly,
B e^{-iθ} = (c + di)(cosθ - i sinθ) = c cosθ + d sinθ + i (-c sinθ + d cosθ)

Adding them together:
Real part: (a cosθ - b sinθ + c cosθ + d sinθ)
Imaginary part: (a sinθ + b cosθ - c sinθ + d cosθ)

So, the real part is (a + c) cosθ + (-b + d) sinθ
Similarly, the imaginary part is (a - c) sinθ + (b + d) cosθ

But since we're only interested in the real part, let's focus on that.

So, Real part = (a + c) cosθ + (d - b) sinθ

Plugging in the values:
a + c = 300 + 24 = 324
d - b = 36 - 468 = -432

So Real part = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Now, we need to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I remember that expressions of the form M cosθ + N sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(M^2 + N^2) and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of R cos(θ + φ) is R, since the cosine function has a maximum of 1.

Wait, but in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So that can be considered as M cosθ + K sinθ, where K is negative.

But regardless, the maximum value is the same: sqrt(M^2 + K^2), because whether it's + or -, the square will be the same.

So let's compute R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2)

Calculating each term:
324^2: Let's see, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400. So 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976

Wait, no, wait. 324 is 300 + 24, so (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 43
