Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, understanding what a b-eautiful number is. The problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met:

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy these conditions. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's model the problem mathematically. If n is a two-digit number in base b, then it can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1 (since leading zeros aren't allowed), and both a and c must be less than b.

So, n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Let me denote k = sqrt(n), so k must be an integer. Then, n = k².

So, putting it together, k² = a*b + c. And since a + c = k, we can express c as c = k - a.

Substituting back into the equation, we get:

k² = a*b + (k - a)

Simplify this equation:

k² = a*b + k - a
k² - k = a*(b - 1)

So, a = (k² - k)/(b - 1)

Since a must be a positive integer (as it's a digit in base b, and a ≥ 1), this tells us that (k² - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b - 1) must be a divisor of (k² - k).

Additionally, since a must be less than b (because a is a digit in base b), we have:

1 ≤ a = (k² - k)/(b - 1) < b

So, (k² - k)/(b - 1) must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive.

Let me think about how to approach finding b. For each base b, I can try to find all possible k such that (k² - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and then check if a is a valid digit (i.e., 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1). Then, for each b, count how many such k exist, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

But since I'm looking for the minimal b, maybe I can find a relation between b and k. Let's see.

Let me rearrange the equation a = (k² -k)/(b-1). Since a must be at least 1, (k² -k) ≥ (b - 1). Also, a must be less than b, so (k² -k) < b*(b -1).

So, for each b, the possible values of k must satisfy:

(b -1) ≤ (k² -k) < b*(b -1)

Let me write this as:

k² -k ≥ (b -1)  --> k² -k - (b -1) ≥ 0
and
k² -k < b*(b -1) --> k² -k - b*(b -1) < 0

So, for each b, I can find the range of k that satisfies these inequalities. Then, for each k in that range, check if (k² -k) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, then a is an integer, and we can check if a is a valid digit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to fix k and find possible b's. But since we need to find the minimal b, maybe it's more efficient to iterate over possible b's incrementally and count the number of k's for each b.

Let me think about how many k's each b can have. The number of b-eautiful numbers corresponds to the number of valid k's for that b. So, I need to find the smallest b where the count is more than 10.

So, let's model this.

Given that a = (k² -k)/(b -1), and a must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

Let me think about the possible k's for a given b.

From the equation, (b -1) must divide (k² -k). So, for each b, I can compute d = b -1, and then find all k such that d divides (k² -k), and a = (k² -k)/d is between 1 and d.

So, for each d = b-1 (since b starts from 2, d starts from 1), we can find k such that d divides k² -k, and 1 ≤ (k² -k)/d ≤ d.

Wait, since a = (k² -k)/d must be ≤ d, because a must be ≤ b-1 = d.

So, (k² -k)/d ≤ d --> k² -k ≤ d² --> k² -k -d² ≤ 0.

So, for each d, find k such that:

1. d divides (k² -k)
2. k² -k ≥ d (since a must be ≥1, so (k² -k)/d ≥1)
3. k² -k ≤ d².

So, the problem reduces to, for each d, find the number of integers k satisfying the above conditions.

But how can we find k for each d?

Alternatively, for each d, the equation k² -k ≡ 0 mod d. So, k(k -1) ≡ 0 mod d. That is, either k ≡ 0 mod d or k ≡1 mod d.

Wait, that's an important point. Because k(k -1) must be divisible by d. So, for each d, k must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo d.

But wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Because d could have factors, so k or k-1 must be divisible by each prime power in d's factorization.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that for d to divide k(k -1), which is the product of two consecutive integers, so they are coprime. So, the divisors of d must be distributed between k and k -1.

Which is, for each prime power in d, it must divide either k or k -1 but not both, since they are consecutive.

Thus, the solutions for k are such that k ≡0 or 1 mod p^e for each prime power p^e in d's factorization.

But maybe that's getting a bit too abstract. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a way to count the number of k's for each d.

Wait, let's take an example. Let's say d = 1. Then, for d=1, any k will satisfy since k(k-1) is divisible by 1. But we also have:

From 1. k² -k ≥1 --> k² -k -1 ≥0 --> k ≥ (1 + sqrt(5))/2
