Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so let's visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. First, maybe I should draw a rough sketch or at least note the triangle's properties. Wait, sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me check if this is a right-angled triangle or not. Let's see: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which isn't equal to 10²=100, so it's not a right-angled triangle. So, it's an acute or obtuse triangle.

But maybe instead of focusing on that, I should think about the circle ω, which is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Points B and C are on this circle, so the tangents at B and C will meet at point D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. Also, D is the ex-pole with respect to BC, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's the ex-pole for BC, but perhaps I should recall that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

So, if O is the center of ω, then OB is perpendicular to the tangent at B, and OC is perpendicular to the tangent at C. The point D is where these two tangents meet. So, triangle OBD and OCD are right-angled at B and C respectively. 

Now, AD intersects ω again at P. So, point P is the second intersection point of line AD with the circumcircle, meaning that AP is longer than AD (or shorter, depending on where D is). But in any case, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P, with P on the circumcircle.

I think I need to find AP in terms of the given side lengths. So, maybe I can use some power of a point theorem here. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² because DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω. So, DB = DC, which might be helpful.

Wait, but point D lies outside the circle ω, and AD is a secant that intersects ω at A and P. So, by the power of point D with respect to ω, we have DP * DA = DB².

But I'm not sure about the exact relation. Let me recall the power of a point formula. If a line from D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY = DB² (since DB is the tangent length). In this case, line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so DP * DA = DB².

But wait, the order of points is A, then P, then D? Or is D outside, so the points are A, P, D? Wait, no, because AD is drawn from A, passing through P and then extending to D. So, the points are A, P, then D outside the circle. So, the power of point D with respect to ω is DP * DA = DB².

Wait, no—wait, the power of D is equal to the square of the tangent from D to ω, which is DB² = DC². For the secant, it's DA * DP = DB².

But let me get the notation right. Let me denote DA as the length from D to A, and DP as from D to P. But since D is outside, and the line passes through A and then P before reaching D, or the other way around?

Wait, actually, AD is the line from A to D, and it intersects ω again at P. So, starting at A, going towards D, it first meets the circle at P, and then goes to D. So, the order is A, P, D. So, the length from D to A is DA, and from D to P is DP. But in the equation, it's DP * DA = DB². Wait, no, the power of point D is equal to DP * DA, but since P is between A and D, the formula should be DP * DA = DB
