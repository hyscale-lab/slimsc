Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box in the set B. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. So, we're dealing with rectangular boxes. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let me denote them as x, y, z. So, the surface area of a box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. And the volume is xyz = 23.

The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is half of that, so r = (1/2)sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r squared would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, to minimize r, we need to minimize x² + y² + z².

So, our goal is to minimize x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Alright, so we have two constraints: surface area and volume, and we need to minimize the sum of squares of the sides.

I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a way to express this without calculus, perhaps using inequalities like AM ≥ GM or something.

Wait, let's think in terms of variables. Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx, and Q = xyz. We know that P = 27 because 2P = 54, so P = 27. And Q = 23.

We also know that for three variables, the sum of squares is S² - 2P. Because (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx), so x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P.

Wait, so x² + y² + z² = S² - 2*27 = S² - 54. So, to minimize x² + y² + z², we need to minimize S².

Wait, but S is x + y + z. So, if I can express S in terms of the given constraints, perhaps I can find its minimum.

But I have another constraint: the volume Q = xyz = 23. So, perhaps I can relate S to P and Q.

Wait, I remember that for three positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(
