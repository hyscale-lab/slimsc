Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The given sides are AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. I need to express AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, connecting AD, which intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is the segment from A to P, and I need to find its length.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, BD = CD because both are tangents from D to ω. That might come in handy.

Also, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-pole or something related to the Gergonne point? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I think D is the exsimilicenter or something like that. But perhaps I should approach this using power of a point.

Power of point D with respect to ω. The power should be equal to DB² = DC² because they're tangents. So, Power of D = DB² = DC² = DP * DA, since AD intersects ω at P and A. So, DA * DP = DB².

Wait, let me write that down more formally. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB², which is also equal to DA * DP because AD passes through A and P on ω. So, DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, and DA, then I can find DP, and since DP = AP - AD? Wait, no. Wait, let me think. AD is the entire length from A to D, and AP is the part from A to P on the circle. So, AD = AP + PD? No, because P is between A and D, right? Because AD starts at A, goes through P, and then continues to D. So, AP is part of AD. So, AP is shorter than AD. So, from A to P is AP, and from P to D is PD. So, AP = AD - PD. Or, in terms of segments, AP * PD = something?

Wait, perhaps I should write the power of D as DB² = DP * DA. So, DP = DB² / DA. But DA is AD, right? Wait, no, DA is from D to A, which is the same as AD. So, DA = AD. So,
