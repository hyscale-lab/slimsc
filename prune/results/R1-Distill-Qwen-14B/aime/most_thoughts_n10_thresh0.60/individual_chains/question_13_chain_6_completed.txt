Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to understand what's going on. 

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with her walking speeds and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time. 

Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, when she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the entire walk takes her 4 hours. But wait, this 4 hours includes t minutes she spends in the coffee shop. So the actual walking time isn't 4 hours; it's less because part of that time is the coffee break. 

Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes in the coffee shop. 

So, I think the key here is to find out the relationship between her walking speed, the time she spends walking, and the total time including the coffee stop. 

Let me denote the time she spends walking alone as T. Then, the total time including the coffee shop would be T + t. 

In the first scenario:
- Speed = s km/h
- Total time including coffee = 4 hours
- So, walking time T = 4 hours - t minutes

But wait, t is in minutes, and the time is in hours. I should convert t to hours to keep the units consistent. So t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, walking time T = 4 - (t/60) hours.

But I also know that distance equals speed multiplied by time. The distance is 9 km. So for the first scenario:
9 = s * [4 - (t/60)]

Similarly, for the second scenario:
- Speed = s + 2 km/h
- Total time including coffee = 2 hours 24 minutes
- Converting 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.
- So walking time T = 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

Again, using distance = speed * time:
9 = (s + 2) * [2.4 - (t/60)]

Now I have two equations:

1) 9 = s * (4 - t/60)
2) 9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)

So I have two equations with two unknowns, s and t. I can solve these equations to find s and t, and then use them to find the time when she walks at s + 0.5 km/h.

Let me write the equations more clearly.

Equation 1:
9 = s * (4 - t/60)
=> s = 9 / (4 - t/60)

Equation 2:
9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)
Substitute s from equation 1 into equation 2.

So equation 2 becomes:
9 = (9 / (4 - t/60) + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but manageable. Let me denote t in minutes as variable t, and work through the equation step by step.

Let me let x = t/60, so x is in hours. Then, t = 60x.

So equation 1:
9 = s*(4 - x)
=> s = 9/(4 - x)

Equation 2:
9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - x)
Substitute s from equation 1:
9 = (9/(4 - x) + 2)*(2.4 - x)

Let me compute the right-hand side.

First, compute 9/(4 -x) + 2.

Let me write 2 as 2*(4 - x)/(4 - x) to get a common denominator.

So, 9/(4 -x) + 2 = [9 + 2*(4 -x)]/(4 -x) = [9 + 8 - 2x]/(4 -x) = (17 - 2x)/(4 -x)

So equation 2 becomes:
9 = [ (17 - 2x)/(4 -x) ] * (2.4 - x )

Multiply both sides by (4 -x):

9*(4 -x) = (17 - 2x)*(2.4 - x)

Let me compute both sides.

Left side: 9*(4 - x) = 36 - 9x

Right side: (17 - 2x)*(2.4 - x)

Let me compute this product.

First, expand the terms:

17*2.4 + 17*(-x) + (-2x)*2.4 + (-2x)*(-x)

Compute each term:

17*2.4: Let's compute 17*2 =34, 17*0.4=6.8. So 34 +6.8=40.8

17*(-x)= -17x

-2x*2.4= -4.8x

-2x*(-x)=2x²

So altogether:

40.8 -17x -4.8x + 2x² = 40.8 -21.8x +2x²

So equation now is:

36 -9x = 40.8 -21.8x + 2x²

Bring all terms to one side:

0 = 40.8 -21.8x +2x² -36 +9x

Simplify:

Compute 40.8 -36 =4.8

-21.8x +9x= -12.8x

So:

0= 2x² -12.8x +4.8

Let me write this as:

2x² -12.8x +4.8 =0

Hmm, let's simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 2:

x² -6.4x +2.4=0

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation for x.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [6.4 ± sqrt(6.4² -4*1*2.4)] / 2

Compute discriminant D:

6.4^2 = 40.96

4*1*2.4=9.6

So D=40.96 -9.6=31.36

sqrt(31.36)=5.6

So,

x=(6.4 ±5.6)/2

Calculate both possibilities:

First solution: (6.4 +5.6)/2 =12/2=6

Second solution: (6.4 -5.6)/2=0.8/2=0.4

So x=6 or x=0.4

But x was defined as t/60, which is in hours. t is the time spent in coffee shop, which must be less than the total time.

Looking back, in the first scenario, total time is 4 hours. So, t must be less than 4 hours, so x = t/60 < 4/60 = 1/15 ≈0.0667 hours. Wait, but x=6 would mean t=360 minutes, which is way longer than the total walk time, which is impossible. Similarly, x=0.4 would be t=24 minutes, which is reasonable because in the second scenario, the total time is 2.4 hours, which is 144 minutes. So 24 minutes is less than that, so it's feasible.

So x=0.4, which is t=24 minutes.

So, t=24 minutes.

Now, let's find s using equation 1:

s=9/(4 -x) =9/(4 -0.4)=9/3.6

Compute 9 divided by 3.6:

3.6 goes into 9 two times with remainder 1.8.

1.8 divided by 3.6 is 0.5.

So total is 2.5

So s=2.5 km/h

So, s is 2.5 km/h. 

Now, the question is, what is the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. 

s + 1/2 =2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, her speed is 3 km/h. 

The distance is still 9 km.

So, time taken to walk is distance divided by speed: 9/3=3 hours.

But wait, that's just the walking time. The total time including the coffee shop is 3 hours plus t minutes.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the first scenario, when she walked at s=2.5 km/h, she took 4 hours in total, which included t=24 minutes in the coffee shop. So her walking time was 4 hours minus 24 minutes, which is 3 hours 36 minutes. 

Wait, but 9 km at 2.5 km/h: 9 /2.5 =3.6 hours, which is 3 hours 36 minutes. That's correct, which matches the 4 hours total minus 24 minutes coffee time.

Similarly, when she walked at 4.5 km/h (s+2=4.5), her walking time was 2 hours 24 minutes minus 24 minutes, which is 2 hours. 9 km at 4.5 km/h is indeed 2 hours. Correct.

Now, when she walks at 3 km/h, her walking time is 9/3=3 hours. So, the walking time is 3 hours, and the total time including the coffee shop is 3 hours plus t minutes.

Wait, but in the first two scenarios, t was included in the total time. So, in the first case, 4 hours included the coffee time, so the walking time was 4 - (24/60) = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours 36 minutes.

So, when she walks at 3 km/h, her walking time is 3 hours, so total time including coffee would be 3 hours plus 24 minutes.

Wait, no, the coffee shop time is t minutes, which is 24 minutes. So, the total time including coffee would be 3 hours (walking) + 24 minutes (coffee) = 3 hours 24 minutes.

Wait, but let me confirm. The problem says, "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So the total time is 3 hours (walking) +24 minutes (coffee) = 3*60 +24= 180+24=204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because in the first scenario, walking at 2.5 km/h took 3.6 hours walking time, which plus 24 minutes is 4 hours total. Similarly, in the second scenario, walking at 4.5 km/h took 2 hours walking time plus 24 minutes, totaling 2 hours 24 minutes.

So in the third scenario, walking at 3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, so total time including coffee is 3h24m, which is 204 minutes.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The problem says, "the walk takes her, including the t minutes." So, in the first two cases, the walk time plus coffee time gives the total time, which is 4 hours or 2h24m. So, in this third case, walk time is 3 hours, and coffee time is 24 minutes, so total is 3h24m, which is 204 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes coffee time, so 204 minutes total.

Yes, that seems correct.


To solve the problem, we first set up two equations based on the given scenarios:

1. When Aya walks at \( s \) km/h, the total time including coffee is 4 hours. The walking time is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Using the distance formula:
   \[
   9 = s \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right)
   \]

2. When Aya walks at \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time including coffee is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. The walking time is \( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Using the distance formula:
   \[
   9 = (s + 2) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right)
   \]

Let \( x = \frac{t}{60} \), so \( t = 60x \). Substituting \( x \) into the equations, we get:

1. \( 9 = s(4 - x) \)  
   \[
   s = \frac{9}{4 - x}
   \]

2. \( 9 = \left(\frac{9}{4 - x} + 2\right)(2.4 - x) \)

Simplifying the second equation:

\[
9 = \left(\frac{17 - 2x}{4 - x}\right)(2.4 - x)
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( 4 - x \) and expanding:

\[
36 - 9x = 40.8 - 21.8x + 2x^2
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
2x^2 - 12.8x + 4.8 = 0
\]

Dividing by 2:

\[
x^2 - 6.4x + 2.4 = 0
\]

Solving using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{6.4 \pm \sqrt{6.4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2.4}}{2}
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
D = 40.96 - 9.6 = 31.36
\]

\[
x = \frac{6.4 \pm 5.6}{2}
\]

This gives \( x = 6 \) or \( x = 0.4 \). Since \( x \) represents time in hours, \( x = 0.4 \) is valid, so \( t = 24 \) minutes. Substituting back, \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:

\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Including the coffee time of 24 minutes, the total time is:

\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{204}
\]
