Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

"Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A."

Alright, so Alice picks a set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024, and I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down. So, for any finite non-empty set B, the maximum element is in A. So, Bob is counting all possible finite non-empty sets where each such set has its maximum element in A. The total number of such sets is 2024. I need to find the sum of elements in A.

Wait, so A is a set of positive integers, which I'll denote as A = {a₁, a₂, ..., a_k}, where each a_i is a positive integer, and they are in increasing order maybe? Or not necessarily? Hmm.

So, for each element a in A, how many finite non-empty sets B have a as their maximum? Because each such set B must have a maximum in A, so each B is determined by its elements, which can include any positive integers as long as the maximum is in A.

Wait, but the elements of B are positive integers, and B is finite and non-empty. So, for each a in A, the number of such sets B where the maximum is a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} times 2^0 (since the maximum a must be included). Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, for a given a, the maximum element of B is a. So B must include a, and all other elements must be less than a. So, the number of such sets B is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, each of which can be combined with a to form B. But since B is non-empty, and a is included, the subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} can include the empty set as well. Because when you add a to the empty set
