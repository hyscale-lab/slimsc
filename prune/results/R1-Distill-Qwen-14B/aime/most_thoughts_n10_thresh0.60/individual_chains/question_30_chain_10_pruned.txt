Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe that can help here. But the product is over all 13th roots of unity, except ω=1. Wait, actually, when k=0, ω^0=1, so the term when k=0 is (2 - 2*1 + 1) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which won't affect the product. So effectively, the product is from k=1 to 12.

So the product is Π_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm. Let me see if I can factor this expression or find a pattern.

Looking at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can rearrange it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. That looks a bit like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me let x = ω^k. Then the term becomes x² - 2x + 2.

So each term is x² - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, x is also a 13th root of unity because ω^k for k=1,...,12 are the non-1 roots.

So our product becomes Π_{x ≠1} (x² - 2x + 2). Wait, that seems promising. Because if I think of the polynomial whose roots are all the 13th roots of unity, that's x^13 - 1. But we're looking at a product over all x ≠1 of (x² - 2x + 2). Hmm, perhaps I can relate this to a value of a certain polynomial evaluated at specific points.

I recall that the product over all roots of a polynomial f(x) of (x - a_i) is equal to f(x), so maybe I can find a polynomial Q(x) such that the product over x (x² - 2x + 2) is related to Q(1), but wait, no, because x here are the roots of x^13 -1=0 except x=1.

Wait, maybe the product Π_{x^13=1, x≠1} (x² - 2x + 2) is equal to something. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as evaluating a certain polynomial at x=1. Let me think about polynomials and roots.

If I have a polynomial P(x) = x^13 -1
