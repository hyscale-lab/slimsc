Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where I have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm, let me jot down what I know. First, the circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. That's an important condition that might help relate different parts of the triangle.

I remember that in a triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. Specifically, r = Area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula R = (a b c) / (4 Area), where a, b, c are the sides.

Since the problem is asking for AB · AC, which are sides b and c if we label the triangle as usual (with BC = a, AC = b, AB = c). So their product is b · c.

I think I'll need to express b · c in terms of other quantities. Maybe using the area and semiperimeter, or some other triangle relations.

Wait, the inradius formula: r = Area / s, so Area = r * s = 6s.

And the circumradius formula: R = (a b c) / (4 Area) = 13. So 13 = (a b c) / (4 * 6s) because Area is 6s. Therefore, 13 = (a b c) / (24 s). Rearranging, a b c = 13 * 24 s = 312 s. So a b c = 312 s.

Hmm, that's one equation. I need another to relate these variables.

Also, there's this condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. I need to figure out what that implies.

I recall that the incenter I and circumcenter O have certain properties. In some triangles, they can coincide, but in general, they are different points. The condition IA ⊥ OI must give a specific relationship between angles or sides.

Let me think about coordinates. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system can help. Let me assume point A is at (0, 0), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use vector geometry or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or triangle centers properties.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the vector from O to I can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. But I'm not sure about that. Maybe another approach.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Yes, I think the formula is OI² = R² - 2 R r. So OI² = 13² - 2 * 13 * 6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, that's a useful piece of information. So the distance between the incenter and circumradius is sqrt(13).

But we also know that IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right triangle with right angle at I. So in triangle OIA, IA is one leg, OI is another leg, and OA is the hypotenuse.

Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So in triangle OIA, OA² = OI² + IA².

Which gives 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA². So 169 = 13 + IA². So IA² = 156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2 *
