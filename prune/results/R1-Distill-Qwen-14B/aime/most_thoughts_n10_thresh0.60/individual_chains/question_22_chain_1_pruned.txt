Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. An equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length, right? And since it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That probably means the hexagon is similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or something, but not necessarily regular.

So, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Wait, AB, CD, EF are every other side of the hexagon. So, if I extend these sides, they meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. Hmm.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Imagine the hexagon ABCDEF, with sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Opposite sides would be AB opposite to ED, BC opposite to FE, and CD opposite to AF, or maybe I have to check that.

Wait, in a hexagon, opposite sides are those separated by two sides. So, in ABCDEF, AB is opposite to ED, BC opposite to FE, and CD opposite to AF. So in this problem, the sides AB, CD, EF are being extended to form a triangle. So, AB and CD are two non-opposite sides? Or are they opposite? Wait, AB is opposite to ED, so CD is opposite to AF. So maybe AB, CD, EF are not all opposite to each other. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB || ED, BC || FE, CD || AF. So, AB, CD, and EF are not all opposite sides. So, to form a triangle by extending AB, CD, and EF, these lines must meet at some points outside the hexagon.

Let me think of a way to model this. Maybe using coordinate geometry? Or perhaps there's a theorem related to such hexagons.

I remember that in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by three pairs of parallel sides, each pair
