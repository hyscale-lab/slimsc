Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand what's going on. 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from this same set S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. If all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. 

Hmm, so I think this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. 

So, I need to find P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B), since if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize. Therefore, the probability of both A and B is just the probability of A. 

Let me calculate P(A) first. P(A) is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since she picks 4 numbers, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers from the same set, the number of possible ways for the lottery is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for her winning the grand prize is 1 (since she picked exactly those 4 numbers). So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4). 

Wait, let me compute C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is the probability that at least two of her numbers match the lottery's numbers. 

Calculating P(B) can be a bit tricky. It's the probability that exactly 2, 3, or 4 of her numbers match the lottery numbers. Alternatively, it's easier to calculate the complementary probability (that she doesn't win a prize) and subtract it from 1. 

The complementary event is that at most one of her numbers matches. So, the number of ways she can have 0 or 1 matches. 

Let me think: the total number of possible lottery draws is C(10,4) = 210 as before. 

The number of ways she can have 0 matches: the lottery picks 4 numbers, none of which are in her chosen set of 4. So, she has 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by her. The lottery must pick all 4 from these 6. So, the number of such combinations is C(6,4) = 15.

The number of ways she can have exactly 1 match: the lottery picks 1 number from her 4, and 3 from the remaining 6. So, the number of such combinations is C(4,1) * C(6,3). 

C(4,1) is 4. C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the total number of losing combinations is 15 (for 0 matches) + 80 (for 1 match) = 95.

Therefore, the number of winning combinations is total combinations minus losing combinations: 210 - 95 = 115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210. Let me simplify that. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 / 5 = 23, 210 /5 = 42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, let me double-check that. 115 divided by 5 is 23, yes. 210 divided by 5 is 42. Yes, so 23/42 is correct.

So, now I have P(A) = 1/210 and P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, but conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B). So, that would be (1/210) / (23/42). Let me compute that.

First, 1/210
