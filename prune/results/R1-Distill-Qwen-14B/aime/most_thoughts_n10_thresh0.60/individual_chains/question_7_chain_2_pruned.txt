Okay, so I've got this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex can be colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that turns all the blue vertices into positions where there were originally red ones. Hmm, that's a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand what exactly the problem is asking. So, imagine we have a regular octagon, which has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue randomly. Now, after this coloring, we want to check if there's a rotation of the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, all the blue vertices should end up where reds were before the rotation.

Wait, but the rotation is done after the coloring, right? So, actually, the original positions are fixed, and when we rotate, the colors move with the vertices. So, the condition is that there exists a rotation such that all the blue vertices, after rotation, are now on top of the original red vertices. So, the image of the blue vertices under the rotation must be exactly the set of original red vertices.

Hmm, maybe another way to think about it is that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you can rotate the blue set to exactly cover the red set, then the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices align with the original red positions.

But wait, in a regular octagon, any rotation is a symmetry, so the group of rotations is cyclic of order 8. So, the possible rotations are by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., up to 315째, which correspond to shifting the vertices by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions respectively.

So, the problem reduces to: what's the probability that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since the octagon is regular, any rotation is just a permutation of the vertices.

Wait, but the total number of colorings is 2^8=256, since each vertex is independently colored red or blue. So, I need to count how many such colorings have the property that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but
