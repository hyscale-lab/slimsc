Okay, so I have this probability problem about a lottery. Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step. I remember that when dealing with conditional probability, the formula is P(A|B) = P(A โฉ B)/P(B). So, in this case, I need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. That translates to P(Grand Prize | Prize).

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the chosen 4. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen.

So, the "prize" scenario includes all cases where she has exactly two, three, or four matching numbers. The "grand prize" is the specific case where all four match. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that she has four matching numbers given that she has at least two matching numbers.

Let me structure this:

- Let G be the event that Jen wins the grand prize (all four numbers match).
- Let P be the event that Jen wins a prize (at least two numbers match).

We need to find P(G | P) = P(G and P) / P(P). But since G is a subset of P (if she has four matches, she definitely has at least two), P(G and P) is just P(G). So, P(G | P) = P(G) / P(P).

So, I need to calculate P(G) and P(P), then divide them.

Let me figure out how many total possible ways there are for the lottery. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). 

C(10,4) is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, the total number of possible lottery draws is 210.

Now, for P(G), the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize is just 1 because she has to pick exactly the same four numbers as the lottery. So, P(G) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find P(P), the probability that Jen wins a prize, which is when she has at least two numbers matching. So, this includes scenarios where she has exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 matches.

To calculate P(P), I can consider the number of favorable outcomes for each case and add them up.

Let's denote:

- A: exactly 2 matches
- B: exactly 3 matches
- C: exactly 4 matches (which is G)

So, P(P) = (Number of A + Number of B + Number of C) / Total number of possible draws.

We already know that Number of C is 1.

Number of A: To compute the number of ways Jen can have exactly 2 matches, we can think as follows. She picks 2 correct numbers and 2 incorrect ones. The number of ways to choose 2 correct numbers from her 4 is C(4,2). Then, the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 numbers from the 6 numbers she didn't pick (since S has 10 numbers, and she picked 4, leaving 6). So, that's C(6,2).

So, Number of A = C(4,2) * C(6,2) = (6) * (15) = 90.

Similarly, Number of B: exactly 3 matches. So, she picks 3 correct and 1 incorrect. The number of ways is C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

And Number of C is 1 as before.

So, adding these up: 90 (for A) + 24 (for B) + 1 (for C) = 115.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for P is 115. So, P(P) = 115 / 210.

Wait a second, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, 90 + 24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yes, that's right.

So, P(P) is 115/210. Let me simplify that. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 115 รท5=23, 210 รท5=42. So, 23/42.

Wait, is 23 and 42 relatively prime? 23 is a prime number, and 42 is 2*3*7. So, yes, 23/42 is in simplest terms.

Similarly, P(G) is 1/210.

So, P(G | P) is (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

Wait, so that's the probability.

Wait, but hold on, let me double-check my calculations for Number of A and Number of B.

For exactly 2 matches (A): C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15. So, 6*15=90. That seems correct.

For exactly 3 matches (B): C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. 4*6=24. That also seems correct.

So, 90+24=114, plus 1 is 115. So, the total favorable is 115.

Therefore, P(P) = 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42.

P(G) is 1/210.

So, P(G|P) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. The problem states that it's m/n where m and n are coprime. 1 and 115 are coprime, so m=1, n=115.

Thus, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me think again. 115 is 5*23, so 1 and 115 have no common factors besides 1. So yes, this is correct.

But just to make sure, another way to think about it: the conditional probability given that she has at least two matches, the chance that she has all four is 1 over the total number of favorable cases, which is 115. So, 1/115. So, the answer is 1 + 115 = 116.

I think that's correct. I can't spot any errors in the logic.


To determine the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, we use conditional probability. Let G be the event of winning the grand prize (all four numbers match) and P be the event of winning a prize (at least two numbers match). We need to find \( P(G | P) = \frac{P(G)}{P(P)} \).

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

- **Calculating \( P(G) \):**  
  There is only 1 way for all four numbers to match, so \( P(G) = \frac{1}{210} \).

- **Calculating \( P(P) \):**  
  This includes cases where Jen has exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.  
  - **Exactly 2 matches:** Choose 2 correct numbers from 4 and 2 incorrect numbers from the remaining 6.  
    \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \).  
  - **Exactly 3 matches:** Choose 3 correct numbers from 4 and 1 incorrect number from the remaining 6.  
    \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \).  
  - **Exactly 4 matches:** Only 1 way.  

  Total favorable outcomes for P: \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \).  
  Thus, \( P(P) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \).

- **Calculating \( P(G | P) \):**  
  \( P(G | P) = \frac{P(G)}{P(P)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115} \).

The probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
