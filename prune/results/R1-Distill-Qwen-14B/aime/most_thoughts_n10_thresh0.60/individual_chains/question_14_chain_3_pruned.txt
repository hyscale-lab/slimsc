Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number, the largest such number where if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when we divide N by 1000, we get Q as the quotient and R as the remainder. So, N = 1000*Q + R, and Q + R is what we need to find.

First, let's break down what N is. Since N is a four-digit number, it can be written as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, and A is not zero.

The key property is that if any one digit is changed to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1 gives a number divisible by 7, changing B to 1 does too, same with C and D.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, so we want the maximum possible four-digit number with this property.

Let me think about how to approach this. Let's consider N as a four-digit number, so N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. When we change any digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.

So, let's denote N1 as the number obtained by changing A to 1, so N1 = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. Similarly, N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D, N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D, and N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these four numbers, they must satisfy N1 ≡ 0 mod 7, N2 ≡ 0 mod 7, N3 ≡ 0 mod 7, and N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

We can write these congruences as:

1. N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

But also, since N is the original number, when none of the digits are changed, N itself might not necessarily be divisible by 7. So, N can be anything, but when any single digit is changed to 1, the new number must be divisible by 7.

Wait, but perhaps N itself has some relation to 7? Let me see. Maybe N is close to a multiple of 7? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the conditions in terms of N and the digits. Let me see.

Let's consider each condition:

1. When A is changed to 1: The new number is 1BCD. So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (100B + 10C + D). So, that's 1000 + (100B + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

But 1000 mod 7 is equal to (since 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6, so 1000 ≡6 mod7).

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, so 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, and 1 mod7 is 1.

So, let's compute each N1, N2, N3, N4 modulo7.

Let me compute:

1. N1: 1BCD = 1000 + 100B +10C + D ≡ (6) + (2B) + (3C) + D ≡ 0 mod7.

2. N2: A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ (A*6) + (2) + (3C) + D ≡ 0 mod7.

3. N3: AB1D = 1000A + 100B +10 + D ≡ (6A) + (2B) + (3) + D ≡ 0 mod7.

4. N4: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B +10C +1 ≡ (6A) + (2B) + (3C) +1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So, we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7.

4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡ 0 mod7.

These are four equations modulo7 that we need to satisfy.

Our variables are A, B, C, D, which are digits (0-9, with A≠0). We need to find the largest four-digit number N=ABCD, so we want A as large as possible, then B, then C, then D.

So, perhaps we can try to find the digits A, B, C, D that satisfy all four congruences.

Let me try to find expressions for D from these equations.

From equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

So, D ≡ -6 -2B -3C mod7.

Similarly, from equation 2: 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

So, D ≡ -6A -2 -3C mod7.

From equation 3:6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Thus, D ≡ -6A -2B -3 mod7.

From equation 4:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A +2B +3C ≡-1 mod7.

Wait, maybe we can use equation 4 to express 6A +2B +3C ≡ -1 mod7.

Then, substituting into equations 1,2,3.

From equation 1: D ≡ -6 -2B -3C mod7.

But 6A +2B +3C ≡ -1 mod7, so 2B +3C ≡ -1 -6A mod7.

Hmm
