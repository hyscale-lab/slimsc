Alright, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a fixed surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. For each box in B, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain it. The radius of this sphere will vary depending on the box's dimensions, but we're looking for the maximum such radius across all boxes in B. In other words, the minimal enclosing sphere's radius for each box will have a maximum value when considering all possible boxes in B, and we need to find that maximum radius squared.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B." Hmm, so does that mean the sphere has to contain every box in B? Or that for each box in B, we find its minimal enclosing sphere, and then find the maximum radius among those? I think it's the latter because otherwise, if it had to contain all boxes, that would probably require a sphere big enough to contain any box in B, but I'm not sure. Wait, the wording says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes." So for each box, the sphere must contain it. So, actually, it's about the minimal enclosing sphere for each box, and then the maximum radius among all these minimal enclosing spheres. Because if the sphere needs to contain every box, then the radius would have to be large enough to contain the largest possible box, which is not likely because the boxes are constrained by surface area and volume. Alternatively, maybe it's the minimal sphere that can contain all boxes in B. Hmm, I think I need to clarify this.

Wait, the problem says: "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B." So each box is contained in the sphere, so the sphere must contain all
