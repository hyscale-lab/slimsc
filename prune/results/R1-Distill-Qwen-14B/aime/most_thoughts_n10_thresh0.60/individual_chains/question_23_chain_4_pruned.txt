Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, hold on, that's for a square. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, but I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular except in the case where it's a square. Hmm, maybe I should just look that up. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at 90 degrees if and only if it's a square. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. For example, in a general rhombus, the diagonals are just bisectors of the angles but aren't perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, but actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in some cases, they can be. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me recall. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but they do bisect each other. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Wait, I think I'm mixing things up with a kite. In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, but in a rhombus, which is a special case of a kite where all sides are equal, the diagonals are still perpendicular. Oh, right! So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each
