Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (xy).

Now, from equation (1a): x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me substitute z from (z) into this.

x = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2), because sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2).

So x = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) since 1/2 is 6/12. So that's 2^(1/12).

Therefore, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let me write this as equation (x).

So now, from equation (x), x is expressed in terms of y. Let me use equation (xy) which says x y = 2^(-2/3). Substitute x from equation (x) into this.

x y = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y = y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So, y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/12):

y^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)

So y^2 = 2^(-3/4). Take square root to find y:

y = 2^(-3/8), since y is positive.

Now I can find x from equation (x): x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)

Convert to common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24. So sum is (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24.

So x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, let me check that calculation again: 2^(-3/8) is 2^(-9/24), and 2^(1/12) is 2^(2/24). So adding exponents:

-9/24 + 2/24 = (-7)/24. So x is 2^(-7/24). Got it.

So, now we have:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)

Hmm, that's helpful. Maybe I can write all in terms of 24 denominator for exponents:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12)

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|. Let's compute that.

First, compute the exponent inside the log:

x^4 y^3 z^2 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 * [2^(-9/24)]^3 * [2^(-10/24)]^2

Compute each exponent:

[2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

[2^(-9/24)]^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)

[2^(-10/24)]^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them together:

2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^( (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6) )

Compute the sum of exponents:

Convert to common denominator, which is 24.

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)

Thus, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

But the problem asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | = 25/8.

25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5^2 and 8 is 2^3, no common factors. So m = 25, n =8, m +n=33.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations, because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.

Let me go through each step again.

First, solving for z:

From (1a): x = y z * sqrt(2)

From (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Substitute y into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2) = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x: 1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

So z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). That seems correct.

Then, from (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4)

So x y = z / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3). That's correct.

From (1a): x = y z * sqrt(2). Substitute z:

x = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(1/12). Correct.

Then x y = 2^(-2/3). Substitute x = y * 2^(1/12):

y * 2^(1/12) * y = y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So y^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)

So y = 2^(-3/8). Correct.

Then x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-9/24 + 2/24) = 2^(-7/24). Correct.

z is 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24).

So exponents:

x: -7/24

y: -9/24

z: -10/24

Then x^4 y^3 z^2:

(2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

(2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)

(2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Sum of exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Convert to 24 denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. So yes, correct.

So log₂ is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So m=25, n=8, m +n=33.

I think that's solid. No mistakes noticed in the process.


We are given the equations:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}, \quad
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}, \quad
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

From these, we express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:

\[
x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}, \quad
y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}, \quad
z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Substituting \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\) into \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\):

\[
x = (xz \cdot 2^{1/3})z \cdot 2^{1/2} = xz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(x\):

\[
1 = z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6} \implies z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

Substituting \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\):

\[
2^{-5/12} = xy \cdot 2^{1/4} \implies xy = 2^{-5/12 - 3/12} = 2^{-2/3}
\]

From \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\) and substituting \(z\):

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/2} = y \cdot 2^{1/12}
\]

Substituting \(x = y \cdot 2^{1/12}\) into \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\):

\[
y \cdot (y \cdot 2^{1/12}) = y^2 \cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-2/3}
\]

Solving for \(y^2\):

\[
y^2 = 2^{-2/3} \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-9/12} = 2^{-3/4} \implies y = 2^{-3/8}
\]

Then, \(x = y \cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-3/8} \cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-7/24}\).

Now, compute \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (2^{-7/24})^4 \cdot (2^{-3/8})^3 \cdot (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6}
\]

Summing exponents:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus,

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8} \implies \left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{25}{8}\) is in simplest form, so \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
