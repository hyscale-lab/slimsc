Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have 900 residents in Aimeville. Each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts, right? But then there are other things they might own: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades. Some own exactly two, some exactly three, and we need to find how many own all four.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem that involves sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps in counting the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering all possible intersections.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Total residents (let's call this T) = 900.
- Number of diamond ring owners (D) = 195.
- Number of golf club owners (G) = 367.
- Number of garden spade owners (S) = 562.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so C = 900. But since it's a given that each owns this, perhaps it's the universal set here.

But wait, the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the total number of people is 900, and all of them have at least the candy hearts. So, when considering other items, we can think of these as subsets of the 900.

The problem also states that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. So, we're told about the numbers for exactly two and exactly three, but not four or just one.

We're supposed to find the number of residents who own all four: D, G, S, and C. Since C is universal, owning all four is the same as owning D, G, S, and C, but since C is already owned by everyone, maybe focusing on D, G, S is sufficient. Wait, no, because the four includes C, but since everyone has C, it's just about the other three. So, the number of people who own all four would be the same as the number of people who own D, G, S, and C. But since C is already part of everyone, it's the same as D ∩ G ∩ S.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of inclusion-exclusion for four sets. But since C is universal, perhaps it's easier to model. Alternatively, maybe model the problem with three sets, since C is given to everyone.

Wait, let me rephrase. Each resident owns at least C. So, the other three items (D, G, S) are optional. So, the problem is about three sets D, G, S, each being subsets of the 900.

We need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S|, the number of people who own all three, but wait, the problem says "all four," but since everyone has C, owning all four is the same as owning D, G, S, and C. So, |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So, the problem reduces to finding the size of the intersection of D, G, S.

Given that, we can use inclusion-exclusion for three sets.

Inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But wait, in this problem, we don't know |D ∪ G ∪ S|. Hmm, but maybe we can find it using the information about exactly two and exactly three.

Let me recall that in such problems, the counts can be broken down into those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items. But since everyone owns at least
