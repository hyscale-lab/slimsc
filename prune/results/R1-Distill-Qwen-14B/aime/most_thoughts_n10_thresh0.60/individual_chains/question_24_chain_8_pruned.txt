Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says: We have a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items.

Alright, let's process each property one by one and see how they can help us determine the list.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers we have, when we add them up, they must total 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently. Since it's unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. So, if 9 appears twice, no other number can appear twice or more. If 9 appears three times, others can appear up to two times, and so on. But it's unique, so no other number shares the highest frequency.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting. So the median is some integer, but it's not one of the numbers in the list. Let me think about what that implies.

Let's start by recalling what median means. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But in this case, the median is an integer, so if the list has an even number of elements, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer. So either both are integers or their sum is even. But the key point is that the median itself is not in the list.

So, perhaps the list has an odd number of elements? Let me think.

Wait, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. But the problem states that the median is not in the list. That can't be. Because if the list has an odd number of elements, the median would be one of the elements. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements because in that case, the median is the average of two middle numbers, which might not be in the list.

So, the list length is even. Let's denote the number of elements as n, which is even.

So, n is even, and the median is (a_{(n/2)} + a_{(n/2 +1)}) /2, which is an integer and not present in the list.

Hmm, that gives us some constraints on the two middle numbers.

Let me consider possible sizes of the list. The sum is 30, which is a relatively small number, so the list can't have too many elements. Let's think about possible n.

Let me also think about the mode. Since the mode is 9, it must appear more frequently than any other number. So, if 9 appears k times, all other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

Let me consider possible n.

Case 1: n=5.

Wait, but n=5 is odd, so the median would be the 3rd element, which is in the list. But the problem says the median is not in the list, so n cannot be 5. So n must be even.

Case 2: n=6.

Then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. So, for n=6, the median is (a3 + a4)/2, which is an integer not in the list.

Similarly, n=8, the median is (a4 + a5)/2.

Wait, but let's see what's the minimal n. Because the sum is 30, each element is at least 1, so the maximum possible number of elements is 30, but that's probably too much.

But we have a mode, which is 9. So 9 must appear more than any other number. So the minimal number of 9s is 2 (if other numbers appear once), but let's see.

Wait, the mode is unique, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, if 9 appears twice, no other number can appear twice or more. If 9 appears three times, others can appear up to two times, but not three.

So, let's see possible n.

Let me try n=6.

If n=6, let's think about the median.

The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th terms. Since it's an integer, the sum of a3 and a4 must be even, so they are both odd or both even. Also, their average is not present in the list.

So, let's denote that (a3 + a4)/2 = m, an integer not in the list. So, m is not equal to a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6.

But let's consider the structure of the list. The list is in non-decreasing order.

Also, the mode is 9, which appears more than any other number.

So, in n=6, to have mode 9, 9 must appear at least twice, and more than any other number.

If 9 appears 3 times, that's possible. Let me try:

Suppose the list has 9 appearing 3 times.

So, [a1, a2, 9, 9, a5, a6]. Wait, but since it's sorted, a1 <= a2 <= 9 <= 9 <= a5 <= a6. But wait, a5 and a6 must be >=9.

But the median would be (a3 + a4)/2 = (9 +9)/2=9. But 9 is in the list, so that's a problem because the median can't be in the list. So that's not possible.

So, if 9 appears three times, and n=6, the median is 9, which is in the list. That violates the condition. So, that can't be.

So, 9 can't appear three times in n=6.

Wait, but what if 9 appears twice? Then other numbers can appear at most once. Let's try that.

So, the list would have two 9s. Let me arrange it:

[a1, a2, a3, 9, a5, a6]. Since it's sorted, a3 <=9, and a5 >=9.

But the mode is 9, so no other number can appear more than once.

So, a1, a2, a3, a5, a6 are all distinct or at most appear once.

Wait, but wait: if 9 appears twice, other numbers can appear once. So, the list would have two 9s and four other distinct numbers.

Let me calculate the sum: sum = a1 + a2 + a3 +9 + a5 + a6 =30.

So, a1 +a2 +a3 + a5 +a6=21.

Now, the median is (a3 +9)/2, which must be an integer not in the list.

So, (a3 +9) must be even, so a3 must be odd because 9 is odd. So a3 is odd.

Also, the median m=(a3 +9)/2 should not be in the list.

So, m must not be equal to any of the elements in the list. The list is [a1, a2, a3, 9, a5, a6].

So m can't be a1, a2, a3, 9, a5, or a6.

But m is (a3 +9)/2. Let's denote m as that.

Also, since the list is sorted, a3 <=9 <=a5.

So, a3 is <=9. Let me think about possible a3 values.

Since a3 is a positive integer, and the list is in non-decreasing order.

Also, the sum of a1 + a2 + a3 +9 + a5 + a6=30.

So, a1 + a2 + a3 + a5 + a6=21.

Let me think about possible a3.

If a3 is 7, then m=(7+9)/2=8. So m=8. Then 8 should not be in the list.

But the list is [a1, a2,7,9, a5, a6].

So, 8 can't be in the list.

So, a5 and a6 must be >=9, and 8 is not there.

But then, a5 and a6 must be at least 9, but not 8.

Wait, but a5 and a6 have to be >=9, so 8 can't be in the list.

So, the list
