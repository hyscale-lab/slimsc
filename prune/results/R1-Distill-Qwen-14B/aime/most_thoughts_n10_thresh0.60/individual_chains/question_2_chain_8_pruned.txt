Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then there's this family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. I need to find a point C on AB, not A or B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB itself. Then, I have to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and sum p and q.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. So, O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. The family F consists of all unit-length segments PQ where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1.

I remember that the equation of a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) can be written as x/p + y/q = 1. The length of PQ is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p² + q² = 1. Therefore, for each segment in F, the endpoints satisfy this condition.

Now, AB is the segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the equation of AB is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1, which simplifies to 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y = 1. Maybe I can write it as 2x + (2y)/sqrt(3) = 1.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (excluding A and B) that's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for this point C, any other segment PQ in F cannot pass through C. So, C is only on AB and no other PQ from F.

I need to find such a point C on AB. Then compute OC squared, where O is the origin.

Hmm. Maybe I need to find where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because when a family of curves has an envelope, it's a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. But in this case, the family F is lines, so their envelope would be a curve that each line is tangent to.

Wait, but AB is one of the lines in the family F? Let me check.

AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so AB is itself a segment in F. So, AB is part of the family F. Therefore, all points on AB are on AB, which is a member of F. But the problem says that C is on AB but not on any other segment from F. So, C must be a point where only AB passes through it, and no other PQ in F passes through it.

So, essentially, I need to find a point C on AB that is not intersected by any other PQ in F except AB itself.

Therefore, C should be a point where AB is the only segment from F passing through it. Which suggests that AB is the only PQ in F that goes through C.

But how do I find such a point C?

Wait, maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. Because the envelope would be the curve that is tangent to each PQ in F, so if AB is the envelope, then at point C, AB is tangent to the envelope, meaning that C is the only point on AB also on the envelope.

Wait, but AB is a member of F, not the envelope. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope of F is a curve that AB touches at point C, and that's the only point of intersection. So, the envelope of F is some curve, and AB is a secant or tangent to it. If AB is tangent to the envelope at C, then C is the only point where AB and the envelope meet, meaning
