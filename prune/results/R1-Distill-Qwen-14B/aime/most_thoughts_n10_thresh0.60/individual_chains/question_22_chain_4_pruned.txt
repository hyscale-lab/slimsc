Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hexagon is convex and equilateral, which means all its sides are equal in length. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, that seems important. So, in a hexagon, opposite sides... Well, in a regular hexagon, which is both equilateral and equiangular, opposite sides are parallel. But here, it's just equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel. So, it's not regular because the angles might not all be equal, but the sides are all the same length.

The problem also mentions a triangle formed by extending the segments AB, CD, and EF. The side lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

I think I should visualize this. Let me try to sketch a rough diagram in my mind. So, ABCDEF is a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Since all sides are equal, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s, where s is the side length we need to find.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Let me clarify which sides are being extended. AB is one side, CD is another, and EF is the third. So, these are three non-consecutive sides of the hexagon. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, CD is parallel to FA, and EF is parallel to BC.

Extending AB, CD, and EF should form a triangle. Let me imagine extending AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F. The intersections of these extended lines should form the triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300.

I think I can model this problem using similar triangles or perhaps coordinate geometry. Maybe coordinate geometry would be more straightforward. Let me set up a coordinate system.

Let me denote the hexagon as follows: points A, B, C, D, E, F in order. Since it's convex, all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Now, since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric hexagon, but not necessarily regular.

Wait, but in a regular hexagon, it's also centrally symmetric, but since this is just equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it might not have central symmetry, but perhaps affine symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe it's a translation of a regular hexagon? Not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can model the hexagon as being formed by translating a triangle. Wait, perhaps if I consider the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF, that triangle could be the "outer" triangle, and the hexagon is somehow inscribed within it.

Wait, let me think of the hexagon as sitting inside the triangle, with each pair of opposite sides lying on lines that are extensions of the triangle's sides.

Wait, maybe using the concept of similar triangles and the properties of the hex
