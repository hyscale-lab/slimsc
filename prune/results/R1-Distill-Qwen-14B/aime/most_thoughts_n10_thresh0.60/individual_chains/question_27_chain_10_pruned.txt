Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6 units. So the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of the sphere, meaning it's inside the sphere and tangent to it. Alternatively, it can rest on the outside, meaning it's outside the sphere and tangent. The points where they touch are circles with radii r_i (internal tangent) and r_o (external tangent). The question is asking for the difference r_i - r_o, which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then I need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find these two radii, r_i and r_o, and then subtract them. But how?

I remember that when two surfaces are tangent, their centers and the point of tangency lie along the same line. So, for internal tangency, the centers of the torus and the sphere are aligned with the point of contact, and the distance between the centers is equal to the difference of their radii. Similarly, for external tangency, the distance between centers is equal to the sum of their radii. Wait, but in this case, the torus is a surface, not a solid sphere. So I need to think about the geometry more carefully.

Wait, the torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution. So when it's inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at some point relative to the torus. I think I need to model the torus mathematically and then find the conditions for tangency.

Let me recall the equation of a torus. If I have a torus centered at the origin, with major radius R
