Okay, so I've got this math problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. That makes sense because each step would be either right or up, so 8 rights and 8 ups, totaling 16 steps. 

The question is asking for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing direction... So, in a grid path, each time you switch from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. I need to count the paths that have exactly four of these changes.

Let me think about how direction changes work. If a path starts by moving right, the first change would be when it switches to moving up. Then, the next change would be back to right, and so on. Each time you switch, it's a new direction.

So, for exactly four direction changes, how many segments of right and up moves do we have? Well, each direction change adds a new segment. If there are four direction changes, that means the path is divided into five segments. Wait, because the first segment doesn't count as a change yet. So for four changes, there are five segments in total.

Each segment alternates between right and up. So, the segments would go right, up, right, up, right (if starting with right) or up, right, up, right, up (if starting with up). So, the number of right and up segments depends on whether the starting direction is right or up.

But wait, since the path starts at the lower left and ends at the upper right, it must end with an up move if it starts with right, or a right move if it starts with up. Hmm, maybe that's important.

Let me formalize this. Suppose the path starts with a right move. Then, the segments would alternate right, up, right, up, right. So, the number of right segments is three and up segments is two, or vice versa? Wait, let me see. If there are five segments and it starts with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, if it starts with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up, so three up segments and two right segments.

Wait, but the total number of right moves
