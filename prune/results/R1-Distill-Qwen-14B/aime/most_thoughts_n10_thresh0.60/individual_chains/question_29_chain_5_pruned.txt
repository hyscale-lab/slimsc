Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means all four of these points lie on a straight line. Additionally, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic or lie on the same circle. I remember that if four points lie on a circle, they must satisfy the cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, I'll try to draw a rough sketch to visualize the problem. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. Let's label the rectangles:

- Rectangle ABCD: Let's assume AB is the base, BC is the height. So, points are A, B, C, D in order, forming a rectangle. So AB = 107, BC = 16. That makes CD = 107 and DA = 16.

- Rectangle EFGH: Similarly, EF is the base, FG is the height. So EF = 184, FG = 17. Therefore, GH = 184 and HE = 17.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, let me imagine this line where these four points lie. Let's assume this line is horizontal for simplicity, but I might need to adjust that later.

So, points D, E, C, F are on a straight line. Let's consider their positions. Since D and C are consecutive vertices of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are consecutive vertices of rectangle EFGH, their positions must be arranged such that D, E, C, F are on the same line.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, D is connected to C via CD. So, if D and C are adjacent, then the line containing D, E, C, F must pass through D and C, with E and F somewhere along that line.

Wait a second, that might not make sense. Because in a rectangle, the sides are at right angles. So, point D is connected to C, but E and F are part of another rectangle, EFGH.

Let me try to place these points on a coordinate system to make it clearer.

Let me assign coordinates to the rectangles.

For rectangle ABCD: Letâ€™s place point D at the origin (0, 0). Then, since BC = 16 and AB = 107, the rectangle ABCD will have sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, point A would be at (0, 16), point B at (107, 16), and point C at (107, 0). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait
