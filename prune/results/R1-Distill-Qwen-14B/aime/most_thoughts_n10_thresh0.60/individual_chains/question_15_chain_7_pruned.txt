Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which I think means they go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, moving only right or up. The condition is that these paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that on an 8x8 grid, the number of steps to go from the start to the end is 16: 8 right and 8 up moves. So each path is a sequence of 16 moves, with 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But we need those that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, a path that goes RRRUUURRRUUURRRUUUR would have several direction changes.

But how does that relate to the number of runs? Oh, right! A "run" is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, if a path changes direction k times, it has k+1 runs. For example, if there are four direction changes, that would create five runs. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of sequences with exactly five runs, alternating between R and U.

But wait, in this case, the direction changes exactly four times, so the number of runs is five. So the path alternates between R and U five times. But since the grid is square, the number of R and U moves must both be 8. Hmm, how does that affect the number of runs?

Let me think. If the path starts with R, then it would go R, U, R, U, etc. Similarly, if it starts with U, it would go U, R, U, R, etc. Since the number of runs is five, which is odd, the starting direction must be either R or U, but the total number of R and U must still be 8 each.

Wait, if the number of runs is five, that means the number of R runs and U runs would differ by one because five is odd. For example, if
