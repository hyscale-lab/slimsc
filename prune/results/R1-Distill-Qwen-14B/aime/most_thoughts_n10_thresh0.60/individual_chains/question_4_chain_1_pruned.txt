Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and each player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make Bob the winner no matter how Alice plays. 

Hmm, let me think. So, this seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's model the game. For each n, I can determine whether it's a winning or losing position. The key is to figure out the losing positions because those are the ones where the current player cannot force a win. Since the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens, the possible moves from any position n are n-1 and n-4.

Wait, but if n is less than 1 or 4, some of those moves are invalid. So, we have to be careful about that. For example, if n is 0, the game is over. So, n=0 is a losing position because you can't make a move. Similarly, if n=1, the player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position.

Let's try to list the positions from 0 upwards and mark whether they are winning (W) or losing (L). 

n=0: L (no moves possible, game ends)
n=1: W (take 1 token and win)
n=2: Let's see, possible moves are to n=1 or n=-2 (invalid). So, from n=2, the player can move to n=1, which is a W position. So, the current player can force the opponent into a W position, meaning n=2 is a losing position? Wait, wait, no. If the current player can make a move to a losing position for the opponent, then the current position is a winning one.

Wait, let me clarify. A position is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

So, for n=0: L
n=1: can move to n=0 (L), so n=1 is W
n=2: possible moves to n=1 (W). Since all moves lead to W, then n=2 is L
n=3: possible moves to n=2 (L) and n=-1 (invalid). So, moving to n=2 (L) is possible. Therefore, n=3 is W
n=4: can move to n=3 (W) or n=0 (L). So, since moving to n=0 (L) is possible, n=4 is W
n=5: possible moves to n=4 (W) or n=1 (W). Both are W, so n=5 is L
n=6: possible moves to n=5 (L) or n=2 (L). Wait, moving to n=5 (L) would be a good move, making n=6 a W position?
Wait, wait, let me double-check.

Wait, for n=6:
- If you take 1 token, n becomes 5, which is L. So, the opponent is now in a losing position. Therefore, n=6 is W.
But earlier, n=2 is L, so from n=6, taking 4 tokens would lead to n=2, which is L. So, either move can lead to L. So, n=6 is W.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me correct that.

Wait, n=5 is L, so if from n=6, you can take 1 token to make it n=5 (L), then the opponent is in a losing
