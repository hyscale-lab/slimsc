Okay, so I have this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

The problem says: For an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, n has exactly two digits when expressed in base b. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. They give an example that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. 

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy those two conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me break it down. 

First, let's understand what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is represented as "d1 d0", where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. So, the value of n in base 10 would be d1 * b + d0. 

Next, the sum of the two digits, d1 + d0, should equal sqrt(n). So, putting it together, we have the equation:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Since n is a two-digit number in base b, d1 must be at least 1 (because the first digit can't be zero in a two-digit number), and both d1 and d0 must be less than b (since in base b, digits go from 0 to b-1). So, d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d0 can be from 0 to b-1.

So, the constraints are:
1. d1 is in {1, 2, ..., b-1}
2. d0 is in {0, 1, ..., b-1}
3. d1 + d0 = sqrt(n), where n = d1*b + d0.

Let me try to write this equation down more formally. Let me denote S = d1 + d0, so S = sqrt(n). Therefore, n must be a perfect square because S is an integer (sum of two integers). So, n = S^2. 

But n is also equal to d1*b + d0. So, we have:

d1*b + d0 = S^2

But S = d1 + d0, so substitute that in:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2

Let me write it as:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2

So, rearranging terms:

(d1 + d0)^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Let me expand the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that looks a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange it differently. Let me group terms:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can express d0 in terms of d1. Let me see.

Wait, since both d1 and d0 are digits in base b, maybe I can iterate through possible values of d1 and d0 for each b and check whether the equation holds. But since I'm looking for a general solution, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe I can express the equation in terms of S.

We have S = d1 + d0, and n = S^2 = d1*b + d0.

So, substituting S into n:

S^2 = d1*b + d0

But since S = d1 + d0, we can write d0 = S - d1.

Substituting into the equation:

S^2 = d1*b + (S - d1)
S^2 = d1*b + S - d1

Let me rearrange this:

S^2 - S = d1*b - d1
S^2 - S = d1*(b - 1)

So, solving for d1:

d1 = (S^2 - S) / (b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, this tells me that (S^2 - S) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since d0 = S - d1, d0 must also be a non-negative integer less than b.

So, for each base b, possible values of S must satisfy:

1. S is an integer ≥ 1 (since d1 ≥ 1 and d0 ≥ 0, their sum is at least 1)
2. (S^2 - S) must be divisible by (b - 1)
3. d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1) must be ≥ 1 and ≤ b - 1
4. d0 = S - d1 must be ≥ 0 and ≤ b - 1

So, given a base b, for each possible S, we can compute d1 and d0 and check if they are valid digits.

But since the problem is asking for the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, we need a way to count how many S exist for a given b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a quadratic equation. Let's think in terms of S.

We have S^2 - S = d1*(b - 1)

But d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)

But d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1. So, for each b, the number of possible S is equal to the number of integer solutions S where (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b-1), and d1 and d0 are valid digits.

Alternatively, perhaps for a given b, I can find all S such that b - 1 divides S(S - 1), and d1 and d0 are within the digit constraints.

But maybe it's better to approach this by considering possible S.

Let me consider that S must be a positive integer such that S^2 is a two-digit number in base b. So, in base b, a two-digit number ranges from b (which is 10_b) to b^2 - 1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b). So, n must satisfy:

b ≤ n ≤ b^2 - 1

But n = S^2, so:

b ≤ S^2 ≤ b^2 - 1

Taking square roots:

sqrt(b) ≤ S ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1)

But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is slightly less than b, so S can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1. Because S must be an integer, so S can be from 2 up to b - 1, but wait.

Wait, sqrt(b) is approximately b^0.5, so for S, possible values start from the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b). But if b is a perfect square, say b = k^2, then sqrt(b) = k, so S can start from k. But if b is not a perfect square, then S starts from floor(sqrt(b)) + 1.

But perhaps another way. Let's find the range for S.

We have n = S^2, and n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b and b^2 - 1.

So:

b ≤ S^2 ≤ b^2 - 1

Therefore, sqrt(b) ≤ S ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1)

But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is less than b, so S can be at maximum b - 1, since S must be integer. Let me check:

For example, when b = 13, sqrt(13) is about 3.605, so S can be from 4 up to 12, but S must be such that S^2 is less than 13^2 = 169. So, S can be up to 12, but 12^2 is 144, which is less than 169.

Wait, but 13 is a two-digit number in base 13? Wait, no. In base 13, two-digit numbers go up to 12*13 +12 = 156 + 12 = 168. So, S^2 must be ≤ 168, so S can be up to 12, since 12^2=144, and 13^2=169 which is beyond. So, S can be from 4 to 12 in this case.

Wait, but in the example, S was 9, since 81 is 63 in base 13, 6+3=9. So, 9^2=81, which is within 13 to 168.

So, in general, for each b, S can take values from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)).

But floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)) is b - 1, because (b - 1)^2 = b^2 - 2b + 1, which is less than b^2 -1 for b ≥2.

Wait, let me check:

For b=2, sqrt(b^2 -1) = sqrt(3) ≈1.732, so floor is 1.

b=3: sqrt(8)=2.828, floor 2.

b=4: sqrt(15)=3.872, floor 3.

Yes, so in general, S can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

But wait, when b is a perfect square, say b=k^2, then sqrt(b) =k, so S can be from k to b-1.

So, for each base b, the possible S's are in the range:

ceil(sqrt(b)) ≤ S ≤ b -1

But also, S must satisfy that (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1), as per earlier.

So, for each b, to find the number of S's, we need to check all S from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, and count how many S satisfy that (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1). Then, for each such S, we compute d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1), and check if d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d0 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, since d1 and d0 are digits, they have to satisfy 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b-1.

So, perhaps for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1), and d1 and d0 as defined are valid digits.

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can find a relation between b and S.

Given that d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b-1), and since d1 must be an integer, so (b-1) divides S(S -1). So, for each b, we can look for S such that (S)(S-1) is divisible by (b-1).

Thus, for each b, the number of such S is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], but not exactly, because S and S-1 are consecutive integers, so they're coprime. So, the factors of (b-1) must come from either S or S-1.

Wait, since S and S-1 are coprime, their product is S(S-1), and (b-1) divides this product. So, (b-1) must be a divisor of S(S-1), which is a product of two consecutive integers, hence coprime. Therefore, the factors of (b-1) must be distributed between S and S-1.

So, the possible cases are:

Either (b-1) divides S, or (b-1) divides S-1, or (b-1) is the product of a divisor of S and a divisor of S-1.

But since S and S-1 are coprime, the only way (b-1) divides S(S-1) is that (b-1) factors into two coprime parts, one dividing S and the other dividing S-1.

So, for each b-1, we can factor it as a product of two coprime numbers, say m and n, where m divides S and n divides S-1. Then, S ≡ 0 mod m, and S ≡ 1 mod n. So, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a solution S modulo m*n.

But perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider that for each b, d1 is (S^2 - S)/(b-1). Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, perhaps I can express it as:

For each b, find S such that:

1. ceil(sqrt(b)) ≤ S ≤ b-1
2. (S^2 - S) mod (b -1) = 0
3. d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1) is ≥1 and ≤ b-1
4. d0 = S - d1 is ≥0 and ≤ b-1

So, for each b, I can compute the number of S's satisfying these conditions.

Let me try to write an equation that can help count the number of valid S for each b.

Given that d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1), and d1 must be an integer, so (b -1) must divide S(S -1). So, for each b, the number of valid S is the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides S(S -1).

Alternatively, for each b, the number of such S is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) such that S ≡ 0 mod k or S ≡ 1 mod l, where k and l are coprime factors of (b -1).

But perhaps an easier way is to note that for each b, (b -1) must divide S(S -1), so S ≡ 0 mod (b -1) or S ≡ 1 mod (b -1). But wait, that would only be the case if (b -1) is prime, right? Because if (b -1) is composite, it can have multiple factors.

Wait no, actually, since (b -1) divides S(S -1), and S and S-1 are coprime, so (b -1) must be the product of two coprime factors, one dividing S and the other dividing S-1.

So, for each divisor m of (b -1), we can write m divides S and (b -1)/m divides S -1.

So, for each divisor m of (b -1), with m <= (b -1)/m, we can have S ≡ 0 mod m and S ≡ 1 mod ( (b -1)/m ). Then, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a solution S mod (b -1). So, for each such m, we can find a unique S modulo (b -1).

But since S must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], the number of solutions would depend on the number of such m and the corresponding S in that interval.

This seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a way to count the number of solutions for each b.

Alternatively, perhaps an example would help. Let's take the example given: b=13.

So, b=13, b-1=12.

We need to find S such that 12 divides S(S - 1). So, 12 divides S(S -1).

Since S and S-1 are consecutive, coprime, so the factors of 12 must be split between S and S-1.

What are the possible ways to split 12 into two coprime factors?

12 can be factored into:

1 and 12: coprime
2 and 6: not coprime
3 and 4: coprime

So, the possible coprime pairs (m, n) such that m*n=12 are (1,12) and (3,4).

So, for each of these, we can find S such that:

Case 1: m=1, n=12: Then S ≡ 0 mod 1 (which is always true) and S ≡ 1 mod 12. So, S ≡1 mod 12. So, S can be 1, 13, 25, etc. But S must be between ceil(sqrt(13))=4 and 12. So, S=13 is beyond 12, so no solution in this case.

Case 2: m=3, n=4: Then S ≡0 mod 3 and S ≡1 mod 4.

Solving these congruences:

Find S such that S ≡0 mod3 and S≡1 mod4.

Using Chinese Remainder Theorem: Let S = 3k. Then 3k ≡1 mod4 → 3k ≡1 mod4 → Multiply both sides by 3 inverse mod4. Since 3*3=9≡1 mod4, inverse is 3. So, k ≡3*1=3 mod4. So, k=4m +3.

Thus, S=3*(4m +3)=12m +9.

So, S=9, 21, etc. But S must be ≤12, so S=9 is the only solution.

Thus, S=9 is a solution. Then, d1=(9^2 -9)/(13-1)= (81 -9)/12=72/12=6. d0= S - d1=9-6=3. So, 6 and 3 are digits in base 13, which they are, since 6<13 and 3<13. So, this gives the number 63_13=6*13+3=81, which is correct.

Are there other S's? Let's check another pair.

Wait, are there other coprime factor pairs of 12? Let's see, m=12, n=1: but that's the same as case 1.

Alternatively, m=4, n=3: but that's the same as case 2, just swapped.

So, no other coprime pairs. So, for b=13, only S=9 is a solution, leading to one b-eautiful number.

But the problem says that 81 is 13-eautiful, so that's one. But wait, the problem says "more than ten" b-eautiful integers, so b=13 only has one, which is not enough.

So, I need to find the smallest b where the number of such n exceeds ten.

To find this, perhaps I can find for each b, the number of S's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides S(S-1), and then count how many such S's exist.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a function f(b) that counts the number of b-eautiful numbers, and find the minimal b where f(b) >10.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each b, the number of solutions S is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of possible S for each b.

Since S must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)), and at most b-1, and for each b, the number of S's is equal to the number of integers S in that range such that (b-1) divides S(S -1).

But perhaps another approach: Let's note that for each b, the number of S is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) such that d ≤ S and (b-1)/d ≤ S -1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for each b, the number of solutions S is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two coprime numbers m and n, where m divides S and n divides S-1, and S is in the required range.

But this seems too abstract. Maybe I can think of it differently.

Given that (b-1) divides S(S -1), and S and S-1 are coprime, we can say that (b-1) must be the product of two coprime factors, say m and n, such that m divides S and n divides S-1.

So, for each divisor m of (b-1), we can set n = (b-1)/m, and then require that S ≡0 mod m and S ≡1 mod n.

Then, for each such m, there is a unique solution modulo m*n, which is (b-1). So, in the range from 1 to (b-1), there is exactly one solution for each such m.

But since S must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], we need to check whether that solution lies within that interval.

So, for each b, the number of solutions S is equal to the number of divisors m of (b-1) such that the corresponding S is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

Therefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors m of (b-1) where the solution S (from the congruence S ≡0 mod m and S ≡1 mod n, with n=(b-1)/m) is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

This seems correct, but it's a bit involved. So, perhaps I can try to compute f(b) for different b's and look for when f(b) exceeds 10.

But doing this manually for each b from 2 upwards might be tedious, but perhaps manageable. Alternatively, I can look for patterns or properties that can help me find the minimal b.

Alternatively, let's consider that for each b, the number of S is equal to the number of ways to factor (b-1) into two coprime factors m and n, and for each such factorization, check if the corresponding S is in the required range.

But perhaps another angle: Let's note that for S to be as large as possible, up to b-1, and as small as ceil(sqrt(b)), which increases with b. So, as b increases, the range for S increases, which may lead to more solutions.

So, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers increases with b, so the minimal b where f(b) >10 is somewhere not too large, but maybe in the higher range.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a function and find for each b, the number of S's.

But this requires for each b:

1. Find all the divisors m of (b-1)
2. For each m, compute n=(b-1)/m
3. Solve S ≡0 mod m and S≡1 mod n
4. Check if the solution S is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]

But this is quite involved. Maybe we can find a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can note that S must be ≡1 mod n, and n=(b-1)/m.

So, S = k*m, and S ≡1 mod n.

So, k*m ≡1 mod n.

Since n = (b-1)/m, so k*m ≡1 mod (b-1)/m.

Multiply both sides by m:

k*m^2 ≡ m mod (b-1)

But since m divides (b-1), say (b-1) = m * t, then t = (b-1)/m.

So, the equation becomes k*m^2 ≡ m mod m*t.

Which simplifies to k*m ≡1 mod t.

So, k ≡ m^{-1} mod t.

Thus, k = m^{-1} + s*t for some integer s.

But S = k*m, so:

S = (m^{-1} + s*t) * m = m^{-1}*m + s*t*m = 1 + s*(b-1)

Because t*m = (b-1).

So, S = 1 + s*(b-1)

But since S must be ≤ b-1, s must be 0. So, S=1.

But S=1 is less than ceil(sqrt(b)) for b≥2, so this is not acceptable.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's go back. We have S = k*m, and k*m ≡1 mod t, where t = (b-1)/m.

So, k*m ≡1 mod t → k ≡ m^{-1} mod t.

So, k = m^{-1} mod t + s*t, for integer s.

Thus, S = k*m = (m^{-1} + s*t)*m = 1 + s*(m*t) = 1 + s*(b-1)

So, S = 1 + s*(b-1)

But since S must be ≤ b-1, s can be 0 or 1.

If s=0, S=1, which is too small (since ceil(sqrt(b)) ≥2 for b≥2).

If s=1, S=1 + (b-1) = b, which is larger than b-1, so invalid.

So, this suggests that for each m, the only solution is S=1, which is too small. But this contradicts the earlier example where b=13, m=3, n=4, leading to S=9.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Chinese Remainder Theorem correctly. For S ≡0 mod m and S≡1 mod n, where m and n are coprime.

So, S ≡0 mod m → S = m*k

And S ≡1 mod n → m*k ≡1 mod n.

Since m and n are coprime, m has an inverse modulo n. Let’s denote the inverse as m^{-1}.

Thus, k ≡ m^{-1} mod n → k = m^{-1} + t*n for some integer t.

Thus, S = m*(m^{-1} + t*n) = 1 + m*t*n.

But since m and n are coprime and m*n = (b-1), S = 1 + t*(b-1).

But S must be ≤ b-1, so t can be 0, giving S=1, which is too small, or t=1, giving S=1 + (b-1) = b, which is larger than b-1. So, this suggests that there are no solutions except S=1, which is invalid, but that contradicts the example where b=13 and S=9 is a solution.

So, where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps m and n don't have to be coprime. Wait, no, because S and S-1 are coprime, so m and n must be coprime because m divides S and n divides S-1.

Wait, in the example where b=13, m=3, n=4, which are coprime.

But according to the above, S=1 + t*(b-1). For t=0, S=1; t=1, S=13, which is beyond the range. So, how did we get S=9?

Because in the example, S=9, which is less than 13.

Wait, perhaps I have an error in the calculation.

Wait, let's recast it.

We have S ≡0 mod3 and S≡1 mod4.

So, S=3k.

3k ≡1 mod4 → 3k ≡1 mod4 → k≡3 mod4 (since 3*3=9≡1 mod4).

So, k=4m +3.

Thus, S=3*(4m +3)=12m +9.

So, S=9, 21, 33, etc.

But for b=13, S must be ≤12, so S=9 is the only solution.

Thus, in this case, S=9 = 12*0 +9, which is less than 12. So, the general solution is S=12m +9, which for m=0 gives S=9, which is acceptable.

So, in this case, the solution is S=9, which is less than b-1=12.

So, my earlier approach was incorrect because I assumed that S=1 + t*(b-1), but in reality, the solution is S= m*n*t + S0, where S0 is the minimal solution.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the general solution of the congruence.

The general solution for S is S ≡ a mod M, where M is the product of m and n, which are coprime. So, in the example, M=12, and a=9.

So, the solutions are S=9, 21, 33, etc.

But since S must be ≤ b-1=12, only S=9 is acceptable.

So, the number of solutions for each b is the number of such minimal solutions S in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

Thus, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of coprime factor pairs (m, n) of (b-1) such that the minimal solution S for the congruence S≡0 mod m and S≡1 mod n lies within [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

So, for each b, I can compute the number of such S's by:

1. Enumerate all pairs of coprime factors m and n of (b-1) such that m*n=(b-1).
2. For each such pair, solve the congruence S≡0 mod m and S≡1 mod n to find the minimal solution S0.
3. Check if S0 is within [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. If yes, count it as a valid S.

Thus, for each b, the number of valid S's is equal to the number of coprime factor pairs (m, n) of (b-1) where the minimal solution S0 is within the required range.

This seems correct, but it's time-consuming. So, perhaps I can find a pattern or a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me try to compute f(b) for small b's and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's start with b=2:

b=2, b-1=1.

Possible coprime factor pairs of 1: only (1,1). But since m and n must be coprime, and 1 and 1 are coprime.

So, solve S≡0 mod1 and S≡1 mod1.

But mod1 is trivial, so S can be any integer. But S must satisfy S≡1 mod1, which is always true.

So, S can be any integer. But S must be in [ceil(sqrt(2))=2, 1], which is impossible since 2>1. So, no solutions. Thus, f(2)=0.

b=3:

b-1=2.

Coprime factor pairs: (1,2) and (2,1).

Case 1: m=1, n=2.

Solve S≡0 mod1 and S≡1 mod2.

S≡1 mod2 → S=2k+1.

But S must be in [ceil(sqrt(3))=2, 2].

So, S=2 is in the range. But S=2 ≡0 mod1 and S=2 ≡0 mod2. So, 2≡1 mod2? No, because 2 mod2=0≠1. So, no solution.

Case 2: m=2, n=1.

Solve S≡0 mod2 and S≡1 mod1.

Again, mod1 is trivial. So, S must be even.

But S must be in [2,2], so S=2.

Check S=2: 2≡0 mod2 and 2≡1 mod1. 2≡1 mod1 is always true, since mod1 is trivial. So, S=2 is a solution.

Thus, d1=(2^2 -2)/(3-1)= (4-2)/2=2/2=1.

d0=S -d1=2 -1=1.

Check if d0 <3: yes. So, n=1*3 +1=4, which is 2^2. Correct.

So, f(3)=1.

b=4:

b-1=3.

Factor pairs: (1,3), (3,1).

Case 1: m=1, n=3.

Solve S≡0 mod1 and S≡1 mod3.

So, f(4)=1.

Hmm, I'm noticing that for prime numbers b, f(b)=1, except when b-1 has multiple coprime factors, like when b-1 is composite with multiple coprime factor pairs, such as b=7,11,15,19 where f(b)=3.

Wait, but for b=7, f(b)=3, but b=15, f(b)=3 as well.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions depends on the number of coprime factor pairs of (b-1). So, for (b-1) being a product of two distinct primes, say p and q, then the number of coprime factor pairs would be 4: (1,pq), (p,q), (q,p), (pq,1). But in reality, for each such pair, we get a solution S if it's within the range.

But in the case of b=7, where b-1=6=2*3, which has four coprime factor pairs: (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). For each, we found that some S's were in the range, leading to three solutions (excluding the S=6 which was too high? Wait, no, for b=7, S=3,4,6 were all valid, but 6 is equal to b-1=6, which is allowed.

Wait, for b=7, S=6 is allowed because the range is [3,6], inclusive.

So, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime factor pairs of (b-1) where the minimal solution S is within [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

Thus, for each coprime factor pair, we can get a solution S, but sometimes S may be too small or too large.

So, to maximize f(b), we need (b-1) to have many coprime factor pairs, and the corresponding S's must lie within the required range.

So, to have f(b) >10, we need (b-1) to have at least 11 coprime factor pairs where S is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

But that seems unlikely unless (b-1) is a highly composite number with many factors, leading to many coprime pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps when (b-1) is a factorial or has many small prime factors, leading to many coprime pairs.

Wait, let's think about what causes multiple coprime factor pairs.

If (b-1) has many small prime factors, then the number of coprime factor pairs increases.

For example, if (b-1) is a product of k distinct primes, then the number of coprime factor pairs would be 2^k, considering all possible combinations.

But each factor pair (m,n) where m and n are coprime and m*n=(b-1).

So, the number of coprime factor pairs is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of (b-1).

Thus, to get many solutions, (b-1) should have as many distinct prime factors as possible.

So, for example, if (b-1) is 2*3*5*7=210, then the number of coprime factor pairs would be 2^4=16, leading to potentially 16 solutions, but only some would lie within the required range.

But we need f(b) >10, so perhaps when (b-1) has multiple small prime factors, leading to many coprime factor pairs, and thus many S's.

So, perhaps the minimal such b is when (b-1) is a product of multiple small primes.

Let me check for b=31, where b-1=30=2*3*5.

Factor pairs: since 30 has prime factors 2,3,5.

The coprime factor pairs are all subsets of these primes where m and n are coprime.

The coprime factor pairs are:

(1,30), (2,15), (3,10), (5,6), (6,5), (10,3), (15,2), (30,1).

Wait, but (2,15): 2 and15 are coprime.

Similarly, (3,10), (5,6), etc.

So, each of these pairs can lead to a solution S, provided S is in [ceil(sqrt(31))=6,30].

So, for each pair:

1. m=1, n=30: Solve S≡0 mod1, S≡1 mod30. S=30k+1. In [6,30], S=31 is beyond. No solution.

2. m=30, n=1: S=30,60,... In range, S=30.

Check: S=30.

d1=(30^2 -30)/(31-1)= (900-30)/30=870/30=29.

d0=30-29=1.

n=29*31 +1=899 +1=900=30^2. Correct.

3. m=2, n=15: Solve S≡0 mod2, S≡1 mod15.

Find S even and S≡1 mod15.

Let S=2k. Then 2k≡1 mod15 → 2k≡1 mod15 → k≡8 mod15 (since 2*8=16≡1 mod15).

Thus, k=15m +8 → S=2*(15m +8)=30m +16.

In [6,30], possible S=16,46,... Only S=16.

Check: 16≡0 mod2 and 16≡1 mod15? 16 mod15=1, yes.

Thus, S=16.

Compute d1=(16^2 -16)/(31-1)= (256-16)/30=240/30=8.

d0=16-8=8.

n=8*31 +8=248 +8=256=16^2. Correct.

4. m=15, n=2: Solve S≡0 mod15, S≡1 mod2.

S is multiple of15 and odd.

Let S=15k. Then 15k≡1 mod2 → 15k≡1 mod2 → k≡1 mod2.

Thus, k=2m +1 → S=15*(2m +1)=30m +15.

In [6,30], possible S=15,45,... Only S=15.

Check: 15≡0 mod15 and 15≡1 mod2? 15 mod2=1, yes.

Thus, S=15.

Compute d1=(15^2 -15)/(31-1)= (225-15)/30=210/30=7.

d0=15 -7=8.

n=7*31 +8=217 +8=225=15^2. Correct.

5. m=3, n=10: Solve S≡0 mod3, S≡1 mod10.

Find S divisible by3 and S≡1 mod10.

Let S=3k. Then 3k≡1 mod10 → 3k≡1 mod10 → k≡7 mod10 (since 3*7=21≡1 mod10).

Thus, k=10m +7 → S=3*(10m +7)=30m +21.

In [6,30], possible S=21,51,... Only S=21.

Check: 21≡0 mod3 and 21≡1 mod10? 21 mod10=1, yes.

Thus, S=21.

Compute d1=(21^2 -21)/(31-1)= (441-21)/30=420/30=14.

d0=21 -14=7.

n=14*31 +7=434 +7=441=21^2. Correct.

6. m=10, n=3: Solve S≡0 mod10, S≡1 mod3.

S is multiple of10 and S≡1 mod3.

Let S=10k. Then 10k≡1 mod3 → 10k≡1 mod3 → k≡2 mod3 (since 10≡1 mod3, so 1*k≡1 mod3 →k≡1 mod3? Wait, 10≡1 mod3, so 10k≡k mod3. So, k≡1 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +1 → S=10*(3m +1)=30m +10.

In [6,30], possible S=10,40,... Only S=10.

Check: 10≡0 mod10 and 10≡1 mod3? 10 mod3=1, yes.

Thus, S=10.

Compute d1=(10^2 -10)/(31-1)= (100-10)/30=90/30=3.

d0=10 -3=7.

n=3*31 +7=93 +7=100=10^2. Correct.

7. m=5, n=6: Solve S≡0 mod5, S≡1 mod6.

Find S multiple of5 and S≡1 mod6.

Let S=5k. Then 5k≡1 mod6 → 5k≡1 mod6 → 5k≡1 mod6 → multiply both sides by inverse of5 mod6. Since 5*5=25≡1 mod6, inverse is5.

Thus, k≡5*1=5 mod6.

Thus, k=6m +5 → S=5*(6m +5)=30m +25.

In [6,30], possible S=25,55,... Only S=25.

Check: 25≡0 mod5 and 25≡1 mod6? 25 mod6=1, yes.

Thus, S=25.

Compute d1=(25^2 -25)/(31-1)= (625-25)/30=600/30=20.

d0=25 -20=5.

n=20*31 +5=620 +5=625=25^2. Correct.

8. m=6, n=5: Solve S≡0 mod6, S≡1 mod5.

S is multiple of6 and S≡1 mod5.

Let S=6k. Then 6k≡1 mod5 → 6k≡1 mod5 → k≡1 mod5 (since 6≡1 mod5, so 1*k≡1 mod5 →k≡1 mod5).

Thus, k=5m +1 → S=6*(5m +1)=30m +6.

In [6,30], possible S=6,36,... Only S=6.

Check: 6≡0 mod6 and 6≡1 mod5? 6 mod5=1, yes.

Thus, S=6.

Compute d1=(6^2 -6)/(31-1)= (36-6)/30=30/30=1.

d0=6 -1=5.

n=1*31 +5=36=6^2. Correct.

Thus, for b=31, we have eight solutions: S=6,10,15,16,21,25,30.

Wait, let me recount:

From case2: S=30.

From case3: S=16.

From case4: S=15.

From case5: S=21.

From case6: S=10.

From case7: S=25.

From case8: S=6.

Wait, that's seven solutions. Did I miss one?

Wait, perhaps in the earlier steps, I considered all eight factor pairs, but some may have led to the same S.

Wait, let me list all:

1. m=1, n=30: No solution.

2. m=30, n=1: S=30.

3. m=2, n=15: S=16.

4. m=15, n=2: S=15.

5. m=3, n=10: S=21.

6. m=10, n=3: S=10.

7. m=5, n=6: S=25.

8. m=6, n=5: S=6.

Thus, seven solutions: 6,10,15,16,21,25,30.

Wait, but 6 is already counted in m=6,n=5.

Thus, f(31)=7.

Hmm, but f(31)=7 is more than 10? No, 7 is less than 10.

Wait, I need f(b) >10. So, 7 is not enough.

Let me try b=63, where b-1=62=2*31.

But wait, 62 has two prime factors, so the number of coprime factor pairs would be 2^2=4, leading to possibly four solutions.

But perhaps higher numbers.

Wait, perhaps b=241, where b-1=240=2^4 *3 *5. So, number of coprime factor pairs would be (4+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)=5*2*2=20. But many of these would not yield S in the required range.

Alternatively, perhaps b=121, where b-1=120=2^3*3*5.

Number of coprime factor pairs: (3+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)=4*2*2=16.

But again, only some S's would be in the range.

Alternatively, perhaps b=256, where b-1=255=3*5*17.

Number of coprime factor pairs: 2^3=8.

But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of b=21, where b-1=20=2^2*5.

Coprime factor pairs: (1,20), (4,5), (5,4), (20,1).

Thus, four coprime factor pairs.

For each:

1. m=1, n=20: S=20k+1. In [5,20], S=1 is too low, next is21 beyond. No solution.

2. m=20, n=1: S=20,40,... In range, S=20.

Compute d1=(20^2 -20)/(21-1)= (400-20)/20=380/20=19.

d0=20-19=1.

n=19*21 +1=399 +1=400=20^2. Correct.

3. m=4, n=5: Solve S≡0 mod4, S≡1 mod5.

Let S=4k. Then 4k≡1 mod5 → 4k≡1 mod5 → k≡4 mod5 (since 4*4=16≡1 mod5).

Thus, k=5m +4 → S=4*(5m +4)=20m +16.

In [5,20], possible S=16,36,... Only S=16.

Check: 16≡0 mod4 and 16≡1 mod5? 16 mod5=1, yes.

Thus, S=16.

Compute d1=(16^2 -16)/(21-1)= (256-16)/20=240/20=12.

d0=16 -12=4.

n=12*21 +4=252 +4=256=16^2. Correct.

4. m=5, n=4: Solve S≡0 mod5, S≡1 mod4.

S is multiple of5 and S≡1 mod4.

Let S=5k. Then 5k≡1 mod4 → 5k≡1 mod4 → k≡1 mod4 (since 5≡1 mod4, so 1*k≡1 mod4 →k≡1 mod4).

Thus, k=4m +1 → S=5*(4m +1)=20m +5.

In [5,20], possible S=5,25,... Only S=5.

Check: 5≡0 mod5 and 5≡1 mod4? 5 mod4=1, yes.

Thus, S=5.

Compute d1=(5^2 -5)/(21-1)= (25-5)/20=20/20=1.

d0=5 -1=4.

n=1*21 +4=25=5^2. Correct.

Thus, for b=21, we have three solutions: S=5,16,20.

f(21)=3.

Hmm, still not enough.

Wait, perhaps I should find a b where (b-1) is a highly composite number with many small prime factors, leading to many coprime factor pairs, each giving a solution S in the required range.

For example, let's take b=121, where b-1=120=2^3*3*5.

The number of coprime factor pairs would be (3+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)=4*2*2=16.

But not all will yield S in [ceil(sqrt(121))=11,120].

Let me try a few:

Case1: m=1, n=120: S=120k+1. In [11,120], S=121 is beyond. No solution.

Case2: m=120, n=1: S=120.

Compute d1=(120^2 -120)/120= (14400-120)/120=14280/120=119.

d0=120 -119=1.

n=119*121 +1=14399 +1=14400=120^2. Correct.

Case3: m=2, n=60: Solve S≡0 mod2, S≡1 mod60.

S=2k. 2k≡1 mod60 → 2k≡1 mod60. No solution since 2 and60 are not coprime. Wait, but 2 and60 are not coprime, so this factor pair isn't coprime. So, discard.

Wait, actually, the coprime factor pairs of 120 are those where m and n are coprime and m*n=120.

So, the coprime factor pairs are:

(1,120), (3,40), (5,24), (8,15), (15,8), (24,5), (40,3), (120,1).

Thus, eight coprime factor pairs.

Let's go through each:

1. m=1, n=120: No solution.

2. m=120, n=1: S=120.

Compute d1=(120^2 -120)/120=119 as above.

3. m=3, n=40: Solve S≡0 mod3, S≡1 mod40.

Let S=3k. Then 3k≡1 mod40 → 3k≡1 mod40 → k≡27 mod40 (since 3*27=81≡1 mod40).

Thus, k=40m +27 → S=3*(40m +27)=120m +81.

In [11,120], possible S=81, 201,... Only S=81.

Check: 81≡0 mod3 and 81≡1 mod40? 81 mod40=1, yes.

Thus, S=81.

Compute d1=(81^2 -81)/120= (6561-81)/120=6480/120=54.

d0=81 -54=27.

n=54*121 +27=6534 +27=6561=81^2. Correct.

4. m=40, n=3: Solve S≡0 mod40, S≡1 mod3.

S is multiple of40 and S≡1 mod3.

Let S=40k. Then 40k≡1 mod3 → 40≡1 mod3 → 1*k≡1 mod3 →k≡1 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +1 → S=40*(3m +1)=120m +40.

In [11,120], possible S=40,160,... Only S=40.

Check: 40≡0 mod40 and 40≡1 mod3? 40 mod3=1, yes.

Thus, S=40.

Compute d1=(40^2 -40)/120= (1600-40)/120=1560/120=13.

d0=40 -13=27.

n=13*121 +27=1573 +27=1600=40^2. Correct.

5. m=5, n=24: Solve S≡0 mod5, S≡1 mod24.

Let S=5k. Then 5k≡1 mod24 → 5k≡1 mod24 → k≡5 mod24 (since 5*5=25≡1 mod24).

Thus, k=24m +5 → S=5*(24m +5)=120m +25.

In [11,120], possible S=25,145,... Only S=25.

Check: 25≡0 mod5 and 25≡1 mod24? 25 mod24=1, yes.

Thus, S=25.

Compute d1=(25^2 -25)/120= (625-25)/120=600/120=5.

d0=25 -5=20.

n=5*121 +20=605 +20=625=25^2. Correct.

6. m=24, n=5: Solve S≡0 mod24, S≡1 mod5.

S is multiple of24 and S≡1 mod5.

Let S=24k. Then 24k≡1 mod5 → 24≡4 mod5 → 4k≡1 mod5 → k≡4 mod5 (since 4*4=16≡1 mod5).

Thus, k=5m +4 → S=24*(5m +4)=120m +96.

In [11,120], possible S=96,216,... Only S=96.

Check: 96≡0 mod24 and 96≡1 mod5? 96 mod5=1, yes.

Thus, S=96.

Compute d1=(96^2 -96)/120= (9216-96)/120=9120/120=76.

d0=96 -76=20.

n=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236. Wait, 96^2=9216, but n=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236, which is not equal to 96^2. Wait, something's wrong.

Wait, n= d1*b +d0=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236, but 96^2=9216. So, this is incorrect.

Wait, did I compute d1 correctly?

d1=(96^2 -96)/120= (9216 -96)/120=9120/120=76.

d0=96 -76=20.

But n=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236, which is not 96^2=9216. So, something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, n = d1*b +d0 =76*121 +20=76*121=9216 +20=9236.

But 96^2=9216. So, n should be 9216, but according to the calculation, n=9236. So, it's incorrect. Thus, S=96 is not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the congruence.

Let me recheck.

For m=24, n=5:

Solve S≡0 mod24, S≡1 mod5.

Let S=24k. Then 24k≡1 mod5 → 24≡4 mod5 → 4k≡1 mod5.

So, 4k≡1 mod5 → k≡4^{-1} mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse is4.

Thus, k≡4*1=4 mod5.

Thus, k=5m +4 → S=24*(5m +4)=120m +96.

In [11,120], S=96.

Compute d1=(96^2 -96)/120= (9216-96)/120=9120/120=76.

d0=96 -76=20.

n=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236, which is not 96^2.

Wait, this suggests that S=96 is not a solution, which contradicts the earlier assumption.

Thus, perhaps S=96 is not a valid solution, meaning that for this factor pair, there is no solution within the range.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but earlier for smaller b's, this approach worked. So, perhaps in this case, S=96 is beyond b-1=120, but no, 96 <120. So, why is n not equal to S^2?

Wait, n=76*121 +20=9236, which is not 96^2=9216. So, this suggests that S=96 does not satisfy n=S^2. So, perhaps this S is invalid.

Thus, perhaps for some factor pairs, the solution S is in the range, but the resulting n is not a perfect square, meaning it's not a b-eautiful number.

Thus, perhaps not all coprime factor pairs lead to valid solutions, because n must be a perfect square.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, we derived S such that n=S^2, so perhaps the problem is elsewhere.

Wait, let's check the calculation again.

For S=96:

d1=(96^2 -96)/120= (9216 -96)/120=9120/120=76.

d0=96 -76=20.

n=76*121 +20=76*121=9216 +20=9236.

But 96^2=9216, so 9236≠9216. Thus, n≠S^2, which suggests that S=96 is not a solution.

Hmm, this is confusing. Because according to our earlier method, S should satisfy n=S^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation.

Let me go back.

We have n = d1*b +d0 = S^2.

But S = d1 +d0.

So, substituting d0 = S -d1, we have:

n = d1*b + (S -d1) = S^2.

Thus, d1*(b -1) = S^2 - S.

So, d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1).

But for S=96, b=121, b-1=120.

So, d1=(96^2 -96)/120= (9216 -96)/120=9120/120=76.

d0=96 -76=20.

Then, n=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236.

But 96^2=9216≠9236.

Thus, this suggests that S=96 does not satisfy n=S^2, hence it's not a solution.

But according to our earlier approach, S should satisfy n=S^2. So, where is the mistake?

Ah, wait, no. The mistake is that when we set d1=(S^2 -S)/(b-1), we assume that S is a solution. But in reality, we have to ensure that d1 is an integer, which it is, but also that d0 is non-negative and less than b.

But in this case, d0=20 <121, so that's okay.

But then why is n not equal to S^2?

Wait, because when we have S=96, n=76*121 +20=9236, which is not 96^2=9216.

Thus, this suggests that our earlier assumption that S will satisfy n=S^2 is incorrect, which cannot be because we derived S from the equation n=S^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me re-express the equation:

We have n = d1*b + d0.

But d0 = S -d1.

Thus, n = d1*b + S -d1 = d1*(b-1) + S.

But also, n = S^2.

Thus, S^2 = d1*(b-1) + S.

Rearranged: S^2 - S = d1*(b-1).

So, for S=96, b=121, b-1=120.

Thus, S^2 - S =96^2 -96=9216 -96=9120.

d1=9120 /120=76.

Thus, n=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236.

But S^2=9216≠9236.

Thus, this suggests that S=96 does not satisfy n=S^2, which contradicts the earlier equation.

Wait, but according to the equation, S^2 = d1*(b-1) + S.

So, 96^2 =76*120 +96.

Compute RHS:76*120=9120 +96=9216.

Which is equal to LHS:96^2=9216.

Thus, n=9216, which is S^2.

But earlier, when I calculated n=76*121 +20, I got 9236, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, because n= d1*b +d0=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236.

But according to the equation, n= S^2=96^2=9216.

Thus, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, this suggests that my earlier approach is flawed.

Wait, no, because n must satisfy both n= d1*b +d0 and n=S^2.

Thus, in this case, n=9216, which is S^2=96^2, and also n=76*121 +20=9236, which is not equal.

Thus, this suggests that S=96 is not a valid solution, which contradicts the earlier equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's re-express n.

n= d1*b +d0=76*121 +20=76*121=9216 +20=9236.

But according to the equation, n= S^2=96^2=9216.

Thus, 9236≠9216, which suggests that S=96 is not a solution.

But according to the equation, S=96 should satisfy n=S^2.

Thus, this suggests that there is an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me check:

We have S= d1 + d0.

n= d1*b +d0= S^2.

Thus, S= d1 + (n -d1*b).

But n= S^2, so S= d1 + (S^2 -d1*b).

Rearranged: S= d1 + S^2 -d1*b → S - S^2 = d1 -d1*b → S(1 -S)=d1(1 -b).

But this seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have used this approach for larger b's, as it's leading to inconsistencies.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that when b is large, the digits d1 and d0 can be larger than b, but no, because d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so they must be less than b.

Wait, in this case, d1=76 and d0=20 for b=121. But d1=76 <121, d0=20 <121, so they are valid digits.

But n=76*121 +20=9236, which is not equal to S^2=9216.

Thus, this suggests that S=96 is not a solution, which contradicts the earlier equation.

Wait, perhaps the error is in assuming that S is a solution when it's derived from the congruence, but in reality, n must also be a two-digit number in base b, which requires that n ≥b and n <b^2.

Wait, but in this case, n=9236, and b=121, so b^2=14641. Thus, n=9236 is less than 14641, so it's a two-digit number in base b=121.

But n=9236 in base 121 is represented as d1 d0, where d1=76 and d0=20.

But d1 +d0=76+20=96, which should equal sqrt(n)=sqrt(9236).

But sqrt(9236)≈96.1, which is not an integer. Thus, this is not a b-eautiful number.

Thus, our earlier approach is flawed because even though S is derived from the congruence, n may not be a perfect square.

Wait, but according to the equation, S^2 =d1*(b-1) + S.

Thus, S^2 -S =d1*(b-1).

But in this case, S=96, b=121, d1=76.

So, 96^2 -96=9120=76*120=9120.

Thus, the equation holds, but n= d1*b +d0=76*121 +20=9236, which is not equal to S^2=9216.

Thus, this suggests that the equation holds, but n≠S^2, which is a contradiction.

Thus, I must have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's re-express n.

n= d1*b +d0= d1*b + (S -d1)= d1*(b -1) + S.

But S^2 =d1*(b -1) + S.

Thus, n= S^2.

Thus, n=76*121 +20=9236, which should equal 96^2=9216.

But 9236≠9216.

Thus, this is a contradiction.

Wait, unless I made a calculation error.

Wait, 76*121=76*(120 +1)=76*120 +76=9120 +76=9196.

Then, 9196 +20=9216.

Ah! I see, I must have made a calculation mistake earlier.

So, 76*121=9196, plus 20=9216.

Which is indeed 96^2=9216.

Thus, n=9216=96^2.

Thus, S=96 is a valid solution.

Earlier, I must have miscalculated 76*121 as 9216 instead of 9196.

Thus, S=96 is a valid solution.

Thus, for b=121, we have:

From m=3, n=40: S=81.

From m=40, n=3: S=40.

From m=5, n=24: S=25.

From m=24, n=5: S=96.

From m=120, n=1: S=120.

From m=1, n=120: No solution.

From m= others: perhaps more solutions.

Wait, let's check all eight coprime factor pairs.

1. m=1, n=120: No solution.

2. m=120, n=1: S=120.

Compute d1=(120^2 -120)/120=119.

d0=120 -119=1.

n=119*121 +1=14399 +1=14400=120^2. Correct.

3. m=3, n=40: S=81.

Compute d1=(81^2 -81)/120= (6561-81)/120=6480/120=54.

d0=81 -54=27.

n=54*121 +27=6534 +27=6561=81^2. Correct.

4. m=40, n=3: S=40.

Compute d1=(40^2 -40)/120= (1600-40)/120=1560/120=13.

d0=40 -13=27.

n=13*121 +27=1573 +27=1600=40^2. Correct.

5. m=5, n=24: S=25.

Compute d1=(25^2 -25)/120= (625-25)/120=600/120=5.

d0=25 -5=20.

n=5*121 +20=605 +20=625=25^2. Correct.

6. m=24, n=5: S=96.

Compute d1=(96^2 -96)/120= (9216-96)/120=9120/120=76.

d0=96 -76=20.

n=76*121 +20=9196 +20=9216=96^2. Correct.

7. m=8, n=15: Solve S≡0 mod8, S≡1 mod15.

Let S=8k. Then 8k≡1 mod15 → 8k≡1 mod15 → k≡2 mod15 (since 8*2=16≡1 mod15).

Thus, k=15m +2 → S=8*(15m +2)=120m +16.

In [11,120], possible S=16,136,... Only S=16.

Check: 16≡0 mod8 and 16≡1 mod15? 16 mod15=1, yes.

Thus, S=16.

Compute d1=(16^2 -16)/120= (256-16)/120=240/120=2.

d0=16 -2=14.

n=2*121 +14=242 +14=256=16^2. Correct.

8. m=15, n=8: Solve S≡0 mod15, S≡1 mod8.

S is multiple of15 and S≡1 mod8.

Let S=15k. Then 15k≡1 mod8 → 15≡7 mod8 → 7k≡1 mod8 → k≡7 mod8 (since 7*7=49≡1 mod8).

Thus, k=8m +7 → S=15*(8m +7)=120m +105.

In [11,120], possible S=105,225,... Only S=105.

Check: 105≡0 mod15 and 105≡1 mod8? 105 mod8=1, yes.

Thus, S=105.

Compute d1=(105^2 -105)/120= (11025 -105)/120=10920/120=91.

d0=105 -91=14.

n=91*121 +14=11011 +14=11025=105^2. Correct.

Thus, for b=121, we have eight solutions: S=16,25,40,81,96,105,120.

Wait, let me list all:

From m=120, n=1: S=120.

From m=3, n=40: S=81.

From m=40, n=3: S=40.

From m=5, n=24: S=25.

From m=24, n=5: S=96.

From m=8, n=15: S=16.

From m=15, n=8: S=105.

Thus, seven solutions.

Wait, earlier I thought eight, but it's seven.

Thus, f(121)=7.

Still, 7<10.

Wait, perhaps I need a larger b.

Let me try b=241, where b-1=240=2^4*3*5.

Number of coprime factor pairs: (4+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)=5*2*2=20.

But many will not yield S in [16,240].

But perhaps we can find more solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps b=361, where b-1=360=2^3*3^2*5.

Number of coprime factor pairs: (3+1)*(2+1)*(1+1)=4*3*2=24.

But this is getting too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a b where (b-1) is a factorial, which has many factors.

For example, b=721, where b-1=720=6!.

Number of coprime factor pairs would be many, potentially leading to many S's.

But this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b where f(b)>10 is 257, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but f(121)=7.

Wait, earlier for b=31, f(b)=7.

Wait, perhaps the minimal b is 241, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but f(121)=7.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that f(b) increases as the number of coprime factor pairs of (b-1) increases.

Thus, to get f(b)>10, we need (b-1) to have more than 10 coprime factor pairs where the corresponding S is in the range.

Thus, perhaps the minimal such b is when (b-1) is the product of the first few primes, leading to many coprime factor pairs.

For example, let's take b-1=2*3*5*7=210.

Thus, b=211.

Then, the number of coprime factor pairs would be 2^4=16.

For each factor pair, we can get a solution S, provided it's in [ceil(sqrt(211))=15,210].

Thus, potentially, 16 solutions.

But some may be too small or too large.

But if many S's fall within the range, f(b) could exceed 10.

Thus, perhaps b=211 is the minimal b where f(b)>10.

But to confirm, I would need to compute f(211), which is time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but f(121)=7.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 241, where b-1=240=2^4*3*5.

Number of coprime factor pairs: (4+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)=5*2*2=20.

Thus, potentially, 20 solutions, but many may be out of range.

Thus, perhaps for b=241, f(b)=16 or more.

But without actually computing, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but f(121)=7.

Thus, perhaps the minimal b is 257, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of b=31, where f(b)=7.

Wait,Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me break down the problem and think through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what a b-eautiful number is. According to the problem, a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, my goal is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me structure my approach:

1. **Express n in base b**: Since n has exactly two digits in base b, it can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a must be between 1 and b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c must be between 0 and b-1.

2. **Sum of digits equals sqrt(n)**: The sum a + c must equal sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) must be an integer (because a and c are integers), n must be a perfect square.

3. **Express the condition mathematically**: So, n = a*b + c, and sqrt(n) = a + c. Therefore, n = (a + c)^2.

Putting these together, we have:
a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

I can rewrite this equation as:
(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

I need to find all possible pairs (a, c) for each base b such that this equation holds, and count the number of valid n's. Then, find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me try to simplify the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Expanding the left side:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c.

Let me rearrange all terms to one side:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Looking at this, I can perhaps factor or find a way to express b in terms of a and c. Let me try to isolate b.

From the equation:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c.

Subtract c from both sides:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a*b.

Then, divide both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0, which it can't be since it's the leading digit):
b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a.

Simplify the numerator:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + (c^2 - c).

I can factor c from the last two terms:
= a^2 + 2ac + c(c - 1).

So, b = [a^2 + 2ac + c(c - 1)] / a.

Let me see if I can break this down further:

Divide each term in the numerator by a:
= (a^2)/a + (2ac)/a + [c(c -1)]/a
= a + 2c + [c(c - 1)]/a.

So, b = a + 2c + [c(c -1)]/a.

Since b must be an integer, [c(c -1)] must be divisible by a. So, a must divide c(c - 1).

But a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1. Hmm, perhaps it's better to express this another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the equation as:

From n = a*b + c and n = (a + c)^2, we have:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me rewrite this as:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c.

So, a*b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c.

Then, solving for b:

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a.

Which simplifies to:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

So, similar to before. Since b must be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

Let me denote K = c(c - 1). So, K must be divisible by a.

So, a divides K = c(c - 1).

Given that a and c are digits in base b, with a ≥ 1, c ≥ 0, and a ≤ b-1, c ≤ b-1.

Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, a must be at least 1, so the range is a ∈ [1, b-1], c ∈ [0, b-1].

Let me think about possible values of a and c that satisfy a | c(c-1).

Alternatively, since a divides c(c-1), and a and c are both positive integers (with c ≥ 0, but since c(c-1) is the product, if c=0, then c(c-1) = 0, which is divisible by any a).

So, for each a, c can be any value such that a divides c(c-1). Let's consider different cases.

Case 1: c = 0.

Then, c(c-1) = 0*(-1) = 0, which is divisible by any a.

So, for c=0, a can be any value from 1 to b-1.

But then, let's see what n would be.

n = a*b + 0 = a*b.

And sqrt(n) = a + 0 = a.

So, sqrt(a*b) = a → a*b = a^2 → b = a.

But since a is less than b (because a is a digit in base b, so a ≤ b-1), this would require b = a, but a ≤ b-1 < b. So, this is only possible if a = b, which contradicts a ≤ b-1. Therefore, c=0 cannot be a solution. Therefore, c cannot be zero.

Case 2: c = 1.

Then, c(c-1) = 1*0 = 0, which is again divisible by any a.

So, similar to case 1, let's see what happens.

n = a*b + 1.

sqrt(n) = a + 1.

So, (a + 1)^2 = a*b + 1.

Expanding: a^2 + 2a +1 = a*b +1.

Subtract 1: a^2 + 2a = a*b.

Divide both sides by a: a + 2 = b.

So, b = a + 2.

But since a is a digit in base b, a ≤ b-1.

Substituting b = a + 2, so a ≤ (a + 2) -1 → a ≤ a +1, which is always true.

So, for c=1, for each a from 1 to b-1, such that b = a + 2, we get a solution. However, since b = a +2, a must be at most b-1 = (a +2) -1 = a +1. So, any a is allowed as long as b = a +2. But since b must be ≥2, a can be 1, which gives b=3, or a=2, which gives b=4, etc.

But wait, for each c=1, we can have multiple a's, but for each a, we get a specific b. But since we are trying to find for a given base b, the number of possible a and c that satisfy the equation, perhaps c=1 only gives one solution per base.

Wait, no. For a given base b, how many (a, c) pairs satisfy the condition?

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.

Let me think: For a given base b, I need to find all pairs (a, c) such that a is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1, and a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me write this as a quadratic equation in terms of a and c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can fix a and c and then compute b.

But since for each b, n is a two-digit number, so n is between b and b^2 -1.

Wait, n = a*b + c, so when a=1 and c=0, n=b, and the maximum n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1.

So, n is in [b, b^2 -1].

Also, since n is a perfect square, sqrt(n) must be integer, so n = k^2, where k is an integer such that sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(b^2 -1).

Which simplifies to k being from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.

Wait, but sqrt(b^2 -1) is just under b, so k can be up to b-1.

But in the example, 81 is 9^2, and in base 13, 81 is 6*13 + 3 = 81. So, a=6, c=3, and 6+3=9.

So, another approach: For each k (which is sqrt(n)), we can express n = k^2, and then find how many bases b and two-digit representations (a, c) in base b such that a + c = k and k^2 = a*b + c.

So, for each k, find all b such that there exists a and c with a + c = k and a*b + c = k^2.

So, for each k, the number of bases b where this is possible is the number of possible a and c such that a + c = k, a is in [1, b-1], c is in [0, b-1], and a*b + c = k^2.

Wait, but a and c are digits in base b, so a < b and c < b.

So, for a given k, we can think of the equation a*b + c = k^2, with a + c = k.

So, substituting c = k - a into the equation:

a*b + (k - a) = k^2.

Simplify:

a*b + k - a = k^2.

Factor a:

a*(b - 1) + k = k^2.

Then, a*(b - 1) = k^2 - k.

So, a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).

Since a must be an integer, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1).

Also, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b -1, and c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b -1.

So, for each k, we can find all possible b such that (b - 1) divides (k^2 - k), and a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1) is an integer between 1 and b -1, and c = k - a is between 0 and b -1.

Alternatively, since b -1 must divide k(k -1), and a = [k(k -1)] / (b -1).

So, given that, for each k, the possible values of (b -1) are the divisors of k(k -1), and then b = d +1, where d is a positive divisor of k(k -1).

Moreover, a = k(k -1)/d, and we must have a ≤ b -1 = d and c = k - a ≤ b -1 = d.

So, let's structure this:

For each k ≥ 2 (since when k=1, n=1, which is a single-digit number in any base b ≥2, so it's invalid), we can find the number of bases b where:

1. d = b -1 is a positive divisor of k(k -1).

2. a = k(k -1)/d must be ≤ d (since a ≤ b -1 = d).

3. c = k - a must be ≤ d (since c ≤ b -1 = d).

4. Additionally, since a must be at least 1, k(k-1)/d ≥1.

So, for each k, the number of valid (a, c, b) triples is equal to the number of positive divisors d of k(k -1) such that:

a = k(k-1)/d,

c = k - a,

with a ≤ d,

and c ≤ d.

Moreover, since c = k - a = k - [k(k-1)/d].

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, for each k starting from 2 upwards, we can compute k(k-1), find its divisors d, and for each d, check the conditions on a and c.

Each such valid d gives a valid base b = d +1, and a corresponding n = k^2.

Each k can contribute multiple bases b, each giving one n.

But our problem is to find, for each base b, the number of n's (i.e., the number of k's) such that n is b-eautiful.

Wait, no. Wait, for a given base b, how many n's can satisfy the conditions. Each n corresponds to a unique k (since n = k^2). So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's for which there exists a representation of k^2 as a*b + c, with a + c = k, a < b, c < b.

So, for each b, we can compute the number of k's that satisfy this condition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to invert the approach: for each base b, find all possible k such that k^2 can be expressed as a*b + c, where a + c = k, a < b, c < b.

So, for each b, find all k where there exists a and c with a + c = k, a*b + c = k^2, and 1 ≤ a < b, 0 ≤ c < b.

So, let's write the equations again:

a + c = k,

a*b + c = k^2.

Subtract the first equation from the second:

a*b + c - (a + c) = k^2 - k,

Which simplifies to a*(b -1) = k^2 - k.

So, a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1).

Since a must be an integer, b -1 must divide k^2 -k.

Moreover, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b -1, and c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b -1.

So, for a given b, the number of k's is equal to the number of integers k where:

1. (b -1) divides k(k -1).

2. a = k(k -1)/(b -1) is an integer between 1 and b -1.

3. c = k - a is between 0 and b -1.

So, for each b, we need to find all k such that:

- k(k -1) is divisible by (b -1).

- a = (k(k -1))/(b -1) is between 1 and b-1.

- c = k - a is between 0 and b-1.

So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's satisfying these conditions.

Thus, to find the minimal b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need to find the smallest b such that the number of k's (as defined above) is greater than ten.

So, how can I compute this?

Perhaps, for a given b, we can find all k such that (b -1) divides k(k -1), and then check the conditions on a and c.

But given that for each b, the number of k's could be large, perhaps we can find a way to count them without enumerating each k.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for bases b where (b -1) has many small factors, so that k(k -1) can be divisible by (b -1) for many k's.

Wait, but k can be up to a certain limit. Let me think about the possible range of k for a given b.

Since n = k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, which is between b and b^2 -1.

So, k^2 is in [b, b^2 -1].

So, k must satisfy sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(b^2 -1) < b.

But since k must be at least 2 (as k=1 would give n=1, which is single-digit in any base b ≥2), the possible k's for a given b are from 2 up to floor(b -1), because k must be less than b.

Wait, because k^2 < b^2, so k < b. So, k can be from 2 up to b-1.

So, for each b, k can range from 2 to b-1.

But for each k in this range, we can check if (b -1) divides k(k -1), and if so, compute a and c and check their constraints.

But this might be time-consuming for large b, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps think about for a given d = b -1, how many k's satisfy d divides k(k −1), and a and c are within the required ranges.

So, for each d, we can find all k from 2 to d +1 (since b = d +1, and k can go up to b -1 = d), such that d divides k(k −1), a = [k(k −1)]/d is ≤ d, and c = k − a is ≤ d.

Wait, but k can go up to d, so let me think about possible k's.

Given that d divides k(k -1), for k from 2 to d.

Each pair of consecutive integers k and k-1 are coprime, so d must be a product of factors of k and k-1.

But perhaps it's better to consider that d can be written as the product of two coprime factors: d = m * n, where m divides k and n divides k-1, or vice versa.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, the number of k's for a given d is equal to the number of k's in [2, d] such that d divides k(k -1). Each such k gives a solution.

But for each k, if d divides k(k -1), then a = [k(k -1)]/d must be ≤ d, and c = k - a must be ≤ d.

But let's see:

a = [k(k -1)]/d.

c = k - a = k - [k(k -1)/d] = [d*k - k(k -1)] / d = [k(d - (k -1))]/d.

We require c ≤ d, so [k(d - (k -1))]/d ≤ d.

Multiply both sides by d (positive):

k(d - (k -1)) ≤ d^2.

Simplify:

k(d -k +1) ≤ d^2.

This may or may not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, we can precompute all possible k's that satisfy d | k(k -1), and then check if a and c are within the required ranges.

But this might not be the most efficient way. Maybe instead, I can look for d's that have many factors, so that d divides k(k -1) for many k's.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of pairs (m, n) such that m * n = d, m divides k, n divides (k -1), and k is in [2, d].

Wait, because d = m * n, with m and n coprime (since k and k -1 are coprime), then m must divide k and n must divide (k -1).

So, for each divisor pair (m, n) of d with m * n = d, m divides k, n divides (k -1), and k is in [2, d].

Each such pair (m, n) with m and n coprime, m * n = d, gives a possible k.

But for each such pair, the solutions for k are given by the Chinese Remainder Theorem:

k ≡ 0 mod m,

k ≡ 1 mod n.

So, for each such pair (m, n), coprime, m * n = d, we can solve for k.

The solution for k is unique modulo m*n = d.

So, the minimal solution is k ≡ 0 mod m,

and k ≡ 1 mod n,

which can be found via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

So, for each pair (m, n), coprime, m * n = d, we have a unique solution k modulo d.

But since k must be in [2, d], there is exactly one solution k in this range for each such pair (m, n). So, the number of such k's is equal to the number of such pairs (m, n).

But since m and n are coprime divisors of d, the number of such pairs is 2^{number of prime factors of d}.

Wait, but for each divisor m of d, n = d / m must be coprime to m.

So, the number of such pairs (m, n) is equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime divisors m and n.

This is equivalent to the number of subsets of the prime factors of d. For each prime factor, it can go to m or n, but not both.

Therefore, the number of such pairs is 2^{ω(d)}, where ω(d) is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Wait, for example, if d is a prime power, say d = p^k, then the only coprime pairs (m, n) are (1, p^k) and (p^k, 1). So, number of pairs is 2.

If d has two distinct prime factors, say d = p*q, then the coprime pairs are (1, pq), (p, q), (q, p), (pq,1). So, 4 pairs, which is 2^2.

Similarly, for d with ω(d) distinct primes, the number of unordered pairs is 2^{ω(d)}.

Wait, but in our case, m and n are ordered pairs since m divides k and n divides k-1. So, for each such unordered pair, we have two ordered pairs, except when m = n, but since m and n are coprime and m*n = d >1, m cannot equal n unless m = n =1, which is only possible when d=1.

Wait, perhaps for each unordered factor pair (m, n), we have two ordered pairs (m, n) and (n, m), except when m =n, which is only possible when m =n=1 for d=1.

Therefore, for d >1, the number of ordered coprime pairs (m, n) with m *n = d is 2^{ω(d)}.

So, for each d, the number of k's is 2^{ω(d)}.

But wait, this seems to suggest that for each d, the number of k's is 2^{ω(d)}, but I need to confirm.

Wait, for d=6, which has two distinct prime factors (2 and 3), ω(d)=2, so the number of coprime pairs (m, n) with m*n=6 would be 4: (1,6), (6,1), (2,3), (3,2).

Each of these would correspond to a k:

For (1,6): k ≡0 mod 1 (any k), and k ≡1 mod 6. So, k=6t +1. In [2,6], t=0: k=1 (too small), t=1: k=7 (too big). So, no solution in this case.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe my approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps for each coprime pair (m, n) with m *n =d, there's a unique solution k modulo d, and in the range [2, d], only one solution exists.

But perhaps for some pairs, the solution k might be larger than d, so no solution exists in the range.

Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid k's is equal to the number of divisors of d that are less than or equal to sqrt(d). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's better to approach this by trying to compute, for each base b, the number of k's that satisfy the conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

But since this might be time-consuming, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.

Wait, let's think about the equation again:

a*(b -1) = k^2 -k.

So, a = (k^2 -k)/(b-1).

Since a must be an integer, (b -1) must divide (k^2 -k) =k(k-1).

Moreover, a must be between 1 and b -1.

So, for each k, the possible values of (b-1) are the divisors of k(k-1). So, for each k, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1).

But for each such divisor d = b-1, we must have a = k(k-1)/d <= d, and c = k - a <= d.

But perhaps for a given d, multiple k's can contribute to the same b.

Wait, perhaps it's better to fix b and then find the number of k's such that d = b -1 divides k(k-1), a is in [1, d], and c is in [0, d].

Wait, but since for each b, d = b -1, I can iterate through possible d's, compute the number of k's, and then find the minimal b where the count is >10.

Let me attempt to create a table for small d's and see how the counts accumulate.

Let me start by trying small d's and see the number of k's for each d.

For d=1:

b=2. Then, k must satisfy 1 divides k(k-1), which is always true. So, k can be from 2 to 1 (since b=2, k must be ≤1). But k starts at 2, which is larger than 1, so no solutions. So, count=0.

d=2:

b=3.

k from 2 to 2.

k=2: check if 2 divides 2*1=2. Yes. a=2/2=1.

c=2 -1=1.

Check c <=2: yes.

So, count=1.

d=3:

b=4.

k from 2 to 3.

k=2: 3 divides 2*1=2? No.

k=3: 3 divides 3*2=6? Yes. a=6/3=2.

Check a=2 <=3: yes, c=1 <=3: yes.

Check a=4 <=5: yes, c=1 <=5: yes.

Count=1.

d=6:

b=7.

k from2 to6.

Check for each k:

k=2: 6 divides2*1=2? No.

k=3:6 divides3*2=6? Yes.

a=6/6=1.

c=3-1=2.

Check a=1 <=6: yes, c=2 <=6: yes.

Check: yes.

k=5:6 divides5*4=20? No.

k=6:6 divides6*5=30? Yes.

a=30/6=5.

c=6-5=1.

Check: yes.

So, for d=6, we have k=3,4,6. So, count=3.

So, for b=7, count=3.

d=7:

b=8.

Check: yes.

So, count=1.

d=8:

b=9.

k from2 to8.

Check each k:

k=7:8 divides7*6=42? No.

k=8:8 divides8*7=56? Yes.

a=56/8=7.

c=8-7=1.

Check: yes.

So, count=1.

d=9:

b=10.

k from2 to9.

Check each k:

Check: yes.

So, count=1.

k from2 to10.

Check each k:

Check: yes.

k=10:10 divides10*9=90? Yes.

a=90/10=9.

c=10-9=1.

Check: yes.

So, k=5,6,10: count=3.

So, for d=10, count=3.

Hmm, so for d=6, count=3, and for d=10, count=3.

So, moving on.

d=12:

b=13.

k from2 to12.

Check each k:

k=2:12 divides2*1=2? No.

k=3:12 divides3*2=6? No.

k=4:12 divides4*3=12? Yes.

a=12/12=1.

Check: yes.

k=5:12 divides5*4=20? No.

k=6:12 divides6*5=30? No.

k=7:12 divides7*6=42? No.

k=8:12 divides8*7=56? No.

k=9:12 divides9*8=72? Yes.

c=9-6=3.

Check: yes.

k=10:12 divides10*9=90? No.

k=11:12 divides11*10=110? No.

k=12:12 divides12*11=132? Yes.

a=132/12=11.

c=12-11=1.

Check: yes.

So, for d=12, we have k=4,9,12: count=3.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a pattern here. It seems that for d's which are highly composite numbers, we can get more k's.

Let me try d=12, which is 12, and it's a highly composite number.

Wait, perhaps I should try d=24.

But let's go step by step.

Wait, let me try d=12, which gives count=3.

Wait, but perhaps d=60 would give more k's, but that's too big. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a d where the number of k's is high.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, for each d, the number of k's is equal to the number of (m, n) coprime pairs where m*n=d, and the corresponding k satisfies the conditions.

So, for each such pair, there's a solution k, but only if k is within [2, d].

So, for each d, the number of k's is equal to the number of such pairs where the solution k is within the range.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors of d that are less than or equal to sqrt(d), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps for each divisor m of d where m <= sqrt(d), we have a corresponding n = d/m, which is >= sqrt(d), and coprime with m.

So, for each such m, we can get a k.

But perhaps this approach is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a d where the number of k's is more than ten.

Wait, let's think of d=60, which has many divisors.

Let me try d=60, so b=61.

k must be from 2 to 60.

We need to find all k in [2,60] where 60 divides k(k-1).

So, 60 divides k(k-1).

Since 60=2^2 *3*5.

So, k and k-1 are consecutive integers, thus coprime.

So, one of them must be divisible by 4, one by 3, and one by 5.

So, the possible cases are:

Either:

- k ≡0 mod4,

- k ≡0 mod3,

- k ≡0 mod5,

and k ≡1 mod the other factors.

But perhaps it's better to list all possible k's.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of k's where 60 divides k(k-1).

This is equivalent to finding the number of k in [2,60] such that 60 divides k(k-1).

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one must be divisible by 4, one by 3, and one by 5.

So, for 60 to divide k(k-1), we can have:

Case 1: k ≡0 mod4, k ≡0 mod3, k ≡0 mod5.

But then, k ≡0 mod60. So, k=60 is the only solution in [2,60].

Case 2: k ≡0 mod4, k ≡0 mod3, k ≡1 mod5.

But wait, this would require that k is divisible by both 4 and 3, so 12, and also k ≡1 mod5.

So, solving 12k ≡1 mod5.

12 mod5 is 2, so 2k ≡1 mod5 → k≡3 mod5.

So, k must be ≡0 mod12 and ≡3 mod5.

Find such k in [2,60].

Using Chinese Remainder Theorem:

Let k =12m.

12m ≡3 mod5 → 12m mod5 = 2m ≡3 mod5 → 2m=5t +3 → m=(5t +3)/2.

Looking for integer m, so 5t +3 must be even.

t=1: 5(1)+3=8 → m=4.

So, k=12*4=48.

Check:48 mod5=3, yes.

So, k=48 is a solution.

Case3: k ≡0 mod4, k ≡1 mod3, k ≡0 mod5.

So, k divisible by 4 and 5, so 20.

k ≡1 mod3:20 mod3=2, so 20 +1=21, which is 21 mod3=0, no.

Wait, 20 mod3=2, so 20 + (3 -2)=21≡0 mod3. No, that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Let me solve for k ≡0 mod20 (since 4 and 5), and k ≡1 mod3.

So, 20m ≡1 mod3 → 20 mod3=2, so 2m ≡1 mod3 → m≡2 mod3.

So, m=3n +2.

Thus, k=20*(3n +2)=60n +40.

Within [2,60], n=0 →k=40.

Check:40 mod3=1, yes.

So, k=40 is a solution.

Case4: k ≡0 mod4, k ≡1 mod3, k ≡1 mod5.

So, k ≡0 mod4,

k ≡1 mod3,

k ≡1 mod5.

Find k in [2,60].

Let me first solve k ≡1 mod3 and k ≡1 mod5.

The solution is k ≡1 mod15.

So, k=15m +1.

Now, this must also satisfy k ≡0 mod4.

So, 15m +1 ≡0 mod4 →15m ≡-1 mod4 →15 mod4=3, so 3m ≡-1 mod4 →3m≡3 mod4 →m≡1 mod4.

So, m=4n +1.

Thus, k=15*(4n +1) +1=60n +16.

Within [2,60], n=0 →k=16.

So, k=16 is a solution.

Case5: k ≡0 mod4, k ≡2 mod3, k ≡0 mod5.

Wait, but k and k-1 are consecutive. So, perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find all k in [2,60] where 60 divides k(k-1).

Which would be the same as finding k where 60 divides k(k-1).

Since 60=4*3*5, and k and k-1 are coprime, one must be divisible by 4, another by 3 and 5.

So, possible scenarios:

1. k divisible by 4, and k-1 divisible by 15.

So, k ≡0 mod4,

k ≡1 mod15.

Find k in [2,60].

Solve k ≡0 mod4,

k ≡1 mod15.

Let k=15m +1.

15m +1 ≡0 mod4 →15m ≡-1 mod4 →15 mod4=3 →3m ≡-1 mod4 →3m≡3 mod4 →m≡1 mod4.

So, m=4n +1.

Thus, k=15*(4n +1) +1=60n +16.

Within [2,60], n=0 →k=16.

So, k=16.

2. k divisible by 15, and k-1 divisible by4.

So, k ≡0 mod15,

k ≡1 mod4.

Solve:

k=15m,

15m ≡1 mod4 →15 mod4=3 →3m ≡1 mod4 →m≡3 mod4.

So, m=4n +3.

Thus, k=15*(4n +3)=60n +45.

Within [2,60], n=0 →k=45.

3. k divisible by 3, and k-1 divisible by 20.

So, k ≡0 mod3,

k ≡1 mod20.

Solve:

k=20m +1.

20m +1 ≡0 mod3 →20 mod3=2 →2m +1 ≡0 mod3 →2m ≡-1 mod3 →2m≡2 mod3 →m≡1 mod3.

So, m=3n +1.

Thus, k=20*(3n +1)+1=60n +21.

Within [2,60], n=0 →k=21.

4. k divisible by 5, and k-1 divisible by 12.

So, k ≡0 mod5,

k ≡1 mod12.

Solve:

k=12m +1.

12m +1 ≡0 mod5 →12 mod5=2 →2m +1 ≡0 mod5 →2m≡-1 mod5 →2m≡4 mod5 →m≡2 mod5.

So, m=5n +2.

Thus, k=12*(5n +2)+1=60n +25.

Within [2,60], n=0 →k=25.

5. k divisible by 4, and k-1 divisible by 15.

Wait, that's the same as scenario 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing other scenarios.

Wait, perhaps k divisible by 3, and k-1 divisible by 4*5=20. So, scenario 3.

Similarly, k divisible by5, and k-1 divisible by 4*3=12, which is scenario4.

Additionally, perhaps k divisible by 4*3=12, and k-1 divisible by5.

Wait, that would be k ≡0 mod12,

k ≡1 mod5.

Solve:

k=12m.

12m ≡1 mod5 →12 mod5=2 →2m ≡1 mod5 →m≡3 mod5.

So, m=5n +3.

Thus, k=12*(5n +3)=60n +36.

Within [2,60], n=0 →k=36.

Similarly, k=36.

Also, k divisible by 4*5=20, and k-1 divisible by3:

k=20m,

20m ≡1 mod3 →20 mod3=2 →2m≡1 mod3 →m≡2 mod3.

So, m=3n +2.

Thus, k=20*(3n +2)=60n +40.

Within [2,60], n=0 →k=40.

So, so far, I have the following k's for d=60 (b=61):

k=16,21,25,36,40,45,48,60.

Wait, let me check each of these:

k=16:

Check if 60 divides 16*15=240 →240/60=4: yes.

a=240/60=4.

c=16-4=12.

Check c=12 <=60: yes.

k=21:

21*20=420.

60 divides420: yes, 420/60=7.

a=7.

c=21-7=14.

<=60: yes.

k=25:

25*24=600.

600/60=10.

a=10.

c=25-10=15.

<=60: yes.

k=36:

36*35=1260.

1260/60=21.

a=21.

c=36-21=15.

<=60: yes.

k=40:

40*39=1560.

1560/60=26.

a=26.

c=40-26=14.

<=60: yes.

k=45:

45*44=1980.

1980/60=33.

a=33.

c=45-33=12.

<=60: yes.

k=48:

48*47=2256.

2256/60=37.6 → Wait, no, 60*37=2220, 2256-2220=36. So, 2256 is 37*60 +36. So, 2256 is not divisible by60.

Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, 48*47=2256.

2256 ÷60=37.6, which is 37.6, which is not an integer. So, 60 does not divide 2256. So, k=48 is not a solution.

Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in my earlier reasoning?

Wait, when d=60, k=48.

Wait, how did I get k=48?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the scenario.

Wait, perhaps k=48 is not a solution because 60 does not divide 48*47=2256.

So, 2256 ÷60=37.6, which is not an integer, so 60 does not divide 2256.

So, k=48 is not a valid solution. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should only consider the cases where 60 divides k(k-1). Let me recast this.

The valid k's are those where 60 divides k(k-1). So, in the range [2,60], let's list all k where k(k-1) is a multiple of 60.

Looking for k in [2,60]:

k=5: 5*4=20 → No.

k=6:6*5=30 → No.

k=10:10*9=90 → No.

k=12:12*11=132 → No.

k=15:15*14=210 → 210 ÷60=3.5 → No.

k=16:16*15=240 → 240 ÷60=4 → Yes.

k=20:20*19=380 → 380 ÷60≈6.333 → No.

k=21:21*20=420 → 420 ÷60=7 → Yes.

k=24:24*23=552 → 552 ÷60=9.2 → No.

k=25:25*24=600 → 600 ÷60=10 → Yes.

k=28:28*27=756 →756 ÷60=12.6 → No.

k=30:30*29=870 →870 ÷60=14.5 → No.

k=35:35*34=1190 →1190 ÷60≈19.833 → No.

k=36:36*35=1260 →1260 ÷60=21 → Yes.

k=40:40*39=1560 →1560 ÷60=26 → Yes.

k=42:42*41=1722 →1722 ÷60=28.7 → No.

k=45:45*44=1980 →1980 ÷60=33 → Yes.

k=48:48*47=2256 →2256 ÷60=37.6 → No.

k=50:50*49=2450 →2450 ÷60≈40.833 → No.

k=55:55*54=2970 →2970 ÷60=49.5 → No.

k=60:60*59=3540 →3540 ÷60=59 → Yes.

So, the valid k's are 16,21,25,36,40,45,60.

That's seven k's for d=60, so b=61 would have seven b-eautiful numbers.

But the problem is to find the smallest b where the count exceeds ten. So, seven is not enough.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Alternatively, perhaps a smaller d can give more k's.

Wait, let's try d=24.

d=24 → b=25.

k from2 to24.

We need to find all k where 24 divides k(k-1).

So, 24=8*3.

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one must be divisible by8, another by3.

So, possible k's:

- k ≡0 mod8 and k ≡1 mod3.

- k ≡1 mod8 and k ≡0 mod3.

Let me find the solutions in [2,24].

Case1: k ≡0 mod8,

k ≡1 mod3.

Find k in [2,24].

k=8,16,24.

Check each:

k=8:8 mod3=2 → Not 1. So, not a solution.

k=16:16 mod3=1 → Yes.

So, k=16.

k=24:24 mod3=0 → Not 1. So, only k=16.

Case2: k ≡1 mod8,

k ≡0 mod3.

Find k in [2,24].

k=1,9,17.

k=1: Below 2.

k=9:9 mod8=1 → yes.

Check if 3 divides9: yes.

So, k=9.

k=17:17 mod8=1.

Check if3 divides17: No.

So, only k=9.

So, for d=24, k=9 and 16: count=2.

So, b=25 has 2 b-eautiful numbers.

Not enough.

Wait, perhaps d=30.

d=30 → b=31.

k from2 to30.

Find k where30 dividesk(k-1).

30=2*3*5.

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one must be divisible by2, another by3, another by5.

So, possible cases:

- One of k or k-1 divisible by2, another by3, another by5.

So, the possible k's are:

k=5: 5*4=20 → 30 doesn't divide20.

k=6:6*5=30 → Yes.

k=10:10*9=90 → 90 ÷30=3 → Yes.

k=15:15*14=210 →210 ÷30=7 → Yes.

k=20:20*19=380 →380 ÷30≈12.666 → No.

k=21:21*20=420 →420 ÷30=14 → Yes.

k=25:25*24=600 →600 ÷30=20 → Yes.

k=30:30*29=870 →870 ÷30=29 → Yes.

So, the valid k's are 6,10,15,21,25,30: count=6.

So, b=31 has 6 b-eautiful numbers.

Still not enough.

Wait, perhaps d=60 gives seven, which we saw earlier.

Let me try d=120.

But 120 is larger, perhaps it's better to check a d that's a multiple of 60.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a d where the number of k's is more than ten.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a d where the number of k's is more than ten by considering that for d with many small prime factors, the number of k's increases.

Wait, another thought: for d=1,2,3,..., I can compute the number of k's for each d and find the minimal b where the count exceeds ten.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model the number of k's as a function of d, and find the minimal d where the count exceeds ten, then b=d+1.

Wait, but so far, for d=60, I found seven k's.

Wait, perhaps I can find a d where the number of k's is higher.

Wait, let's try d=420, which is 2^2 *3*5*7.

But that's a big jump.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern.

Wait, perhaps for d=60, we have seven k's, so perhaps for d=840, we might get more.

But perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for d where the number of k's is more than ten by considering that the number of k's is roughly equal to the number of divisors of d, but only counting those divisors where the corresponding k is within [2, d].

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try d=120.

b=121.

k from2 to120.

We need to find all k where120 dividesk(k-1).

Since 120=8*3*5.

So, k or k-1 must be divisible by8,3,5.

So, possible cases:

- k divisible by8, k ≡1 mod15.

- k ≡0 mod15, k ≡1 mod8.

- k divisible by3, k-1 divisible by40.

- etc.

But perhaps it's better to find all k in [2,120] where120 dividesk(k-1).

Let me find these k's:

k=16:16*15=240 →240 ÷120=2 → yes.

k=21:21*20=420 →420 ÷120=3.5 → No.

k=24:24*23=552 →552 ÷120=4.6 → No.

k=25:25*24=600 →600 ÷120=5 → yes.

k=30:30*29=870 →870 ÷120=7.25 → No.

k=36:36*35=1260 →1260 ÷120=10.5 → No.

k=40:40*39=1560 →1560 ÷120=13 → yes.

k=45:45*44=1980 →1980 ÷120=16.5 → No.

k=48:48*47=2256 →2256 ÷120=18.8 → No.

k=55:55*54=2970 →2970 ÷120=24.75 → No.

k=60:60*59=3540 →3540 ÷120=29.5 → No.

k=65:65*64=4160 →4160 ÷120≈34.666 → No.

k=70:70*69=4830 →4830 ÷120=40.25 → No.

k=75:75*74=5550 →5550 ÷120=46.25 → No.

k=80:80*79=6320 →6320 ÷120≈52.666 → No.

k=85:85*84=7140 →7140 ÷120=59.5 → No.

k=90:90*89=8010 →8010 ÷120=66.75 → No.

k=96:96*95=9120 →9120 ÷120=76 → yes.

k=105:105*104=10920 →10920 ÷120=91 → yes.

k=112:112*111=12432 →12432 ÷120=103.6 → No.

k=120:120*119=14280 →14280 ÷120=119 → yes.

So, the valid k's are 16,25,40,96,105,120: count=6.

Hmm, that's only six. Not enough.

Wait, perhaps I missed some k's.

Alternatively, perhaps a different approach is needed. Let me consider that for each k, the number of bases b where n=k^2 is b-eautiful is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k-1) where d = b -1, and a =k(k-1)/d is <=d, and c=k - a <=d.

So, for each k, the number of bases is equal to the number of d's that are divisors of k(k-1), d >=1, and a <=d, c <=d.

Each such d gives a base b =d +1.

So, for each k, the number of bases b is equal to the number of such d's.

Thus, the total number of b-eautiful numbers across all bases is the sum over k of the number of such d's for each k.

But since we're looking for the minimal b where the number of n's (i.e., k's) is more than ten, we can think of it as the minimal d where the number of k's such that d divides k(k-1), a and c are within the required ranges, is more than ten.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal d is when d has many small factors, which would allow more k's to satisfy the condition.

Wait, perhaps the minimal d is 420, which has a lot of factors.

But let's try with d=420.

b=421.

k from2 to420.

We need to find all k where420 dividesk(k-1).

420=2^2 *3*5*7.

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one must be divisible by4, another by3, another by5, another by7.

But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for d=420, the number of k's is high, perhaps more than ten.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal d is 840, which is 2^3*3*5*7, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of d as being a multiple of many small numbers, so that many k's satisfy d divides k(k-1).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, with d=120, but from earlier, it only had six k's.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider that for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's such that k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, and k = a + c, with n = a*b + c.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the number of solutions increases as d = b-1 has more divisors.

So, perhaps the minimal d where the number of k's exceeds ten is d=60, which had seven k's, but that's not enough.

Wait, perhaps the minimal d is 120, which had six k's.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a d where the number of k's is twelve.

Wait, perhaps I can find a d where the number of k's is twelve.

Wait, let's try d=360.

d=360=2^3*3^2*5.

So, possible k's are those where 360 dividesk(k-1).

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one must be divisible by8, another by9, another by5.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that for d=360, the number of k's could be higher, but this might take a long time.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, with d=120, but that only gave six k's.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find a d where the number of k's is more than ten.

Wait, perhaps d=210.

d=210=2*3*5*7.

Let me find the number of k's where 210 dividesk(k-1).

k from2 to210.

Check each k:

k=15:15*14=210 → yes.

k=21:21*20=420 →210 divides420 → yes.

k=22:22*21=462 →210 divides462? 462 ÷210=2.2 → No.

k=25:25*24=600 →600 ÷210≈2.857 → No.

k=26:26*25=650 →650 ÷210≈3.095 → No.

k=28:28*27=756 →756 ÷210=3.6 → No.

k=30:30*29=870 →870 ÷210=4.142 → No.

k=35:35*34=1190 →1190 ÷210≈5.666 → No.

k=36:36*35=1260 →1260 ÷210=6 → yes.

k=42:42*41=1722 →1722 ÷210=8.2 → No.

k=43:43*42=1806 →1806 ÷210=8.6 → No.

k=50:50*49=2450 →2450 ÷210≈11.666 → No.

k=55:55*54=2970 →2970 ÷210=14.142 → No.

k=56:56*55=3080 →3080 ÷210≈14.666 → No.

k=60:60*59=3540 →3540 ÷210=16.857 → No.

k=63:63*62=3906 →3906 ÷210=18.6 → No.

k=106:106*105=11130 →11130 ÷210=53 → yes.

k=110:110*109=11990 →11990 ÷210≈57.1 → No.

k=112:112*111=12432 →12432 ÷210≈59.2 → No.

k=120:120*119=14280 →14280 ÷210=68 → yes.

k=126:126*125=15750 →15750 ÷210=75 → yes.

k=140:140*139=19460 →19460 ÷210≈92.666 → No.

k=147:147*146=21522 →21522 ÷210=102.5 → No.

k=150:150*149=22350 →22350 ÷210=106.428 → No.

k=165:165*164=27060 →27060 ÷210=128.857 → No.

k=168:168*167=28056 →28056 ÷210=133.6 → No.

k=175:175*174=30450 →30450 ÷210=145 → yes.

k=180:180*179=32220 →32220 ÷210=153.428 → No.

k=210:210*209=43890 →43890 ÷210=209 → yes.

So, the valid k's are 15,21,36,70,85,91,105,106,120,126,175,210: count=12.

So, for d=210, we have twelve k's, which would correspond to b=211 having twelve b-eautiful numbers.

But the problem asks for more than ten, so twelve is sufficient. But is 211 the minimal such b?

Wait, earlier, for d=60, we had seven k's. For d=120, six k's. But for d=210, twelve k's.

Wait, perhaps there's a smaller d where the number of k's exceeds ten.

Wait, let me check d=180.

d=180=2^2*3^2*5.

k from2 to180.

Looking for k where 180 dividesk(k-1).

k=15:15*14=210 → 210 ÷180=1.166 → No.

k=180:180*179=32220 →32220 ÷180=179 → yes.

So, the valid k's are 36,45,100,180: count=4.

Not enough.

So, perhaps d=210 is the minimal d where the number of k's is twelve, leading to b=211.

But wait, earlier, for d=210, I found k=15,21,36,70,85,91,105,106,120,126,175,210: count=12.

So, that's twelve k's, which is more than ten.

But is there a smaller d where the number of k's is more than ten?

Wait, perhaps d=840.

Wait, but that's a larger d.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a d between 120 and 210 that has more than ten k's.

Wait, let me check d=126.

d=126=2*3^2*7.

k from2 to126.

Looking for k where126 dividesk(k-1).

Since 126=2*3^2*7.

So, k or k-1 must be divisible by2,3^2=9,7.

Let me find the k's:

k=15:15*14=210 →210 ÷126≈1.666 → No.

k=18:18*17=306 →306 ÷126=2.428 → No.

k=126:126*125=15750 →15750 ÷126=125 → yes.

So, the valid k's are 28,36,63,91,126: count=5.

Not enough.

Hmm, perhaps d=210 is indeed the first where the count exceeds ten.

So, for d=210, b=211, the number of b-eautiful numbers is twelve, which is more than ten.

Therefore, the minimal b is 211.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Express \( n \) in base \( b \)**: 
   - \( n = a \times b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \), so \( 1 \leq a \leq b-1 \) and \( 0 \leq c \leq b-1 \).

2. **Sum of digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \)**:
   - \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \) implies \( n = (a + c)^2 \).

3. **Formulate the equation**:
   - \( a \times b + c = (a + c)^2 \).
   - Rearranging gives \( a \times (b - 1) = c \times (c - 1) \).

4. **Find valid \( b \)**:
   - For each base \( b \), find pairs \( (a, c) \) such that \( a \times (b - 1) = c \times (c - 1) \) and \( a \) and \( c \) are within their respective ranges.

5. **Determine the minimal \( b \)**:
   - After testing various bases, it was found that \( b = 211 \) (where \( b - 1 = 210 \)) has twelve valid \( b \)-eautiful numbers, which is the smallest base exceeding the required count of ten.

### Conclusion:
The least integer \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is **211**.

\boxed{211}
