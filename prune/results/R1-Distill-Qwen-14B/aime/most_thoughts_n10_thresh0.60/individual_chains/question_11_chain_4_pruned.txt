Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let me try to figure out how to approach this.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions like this, it's often useful to express \( z \) in polar form. Since the modulus of \( z \) is 4, I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). This might simplify the expression because dividing by \( z \) would just be taking the reciprocal of the modulus and subtracting the angle.

Let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So, substituting these into the given expression:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) z = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (96 + 144i) * \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression becomes:

\( (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute the constants first.

First term: \( (75 + 117i) * 4 = 300 + 468i \).

So the expression is:

\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, maybe I can expand these using Euler's formula. Remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, expanding each term:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Let me compute each multiplication separately.

Starting with the first term:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \) 

Multiply out:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta

But \( i^2 = -1 \), so:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta

Imaginary: 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta

So the first term is:

(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)

Similarly, compute the second term:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Multiply out:

= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2 \sin\theta

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \):

= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta

Imaginary: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)

So the second term is:

(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)

Now, adding the two terms together:

First, the real parts of both terms:

Real part: (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)

= (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta

= 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta

Imaginary part: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)

= (300 -24)\sin\theta + (468 +36)\cos\theta

= 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta

So the entire expression is:

[324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta] + i[276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta]

But we're only interested in the real part of this expression. So the real part is:

324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta

So our goal is to find the maximum value of 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

Hmm, okay, that's a real function in terms of theta. So the maximum value of A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, but here it's 324 cos theta minus 432 sin theta. So it's like A cos theta + B sin theta, where A=324 and B=-432.

So the maximum is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.

Wait, but let me make sure. The maximum of C cos theta + D sin theta is sqrt(C^2 + D^2). So yes, regardless of the signs, it's the same.

So, maximum real part is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2).

Compute that:

First, compute 324^2:

324 * 324: 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400.

So (300 +24)^2= 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2= 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160000, 32^2=1024, cross term 2*400*32=25600.

So (400 +32)^2=400^2 +2*400*32 +32^2=160000 +25600 +1024=186624.

So sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600).

What is 291600 under the square root? Let me see: 291600=2916*100, and sqrt(100)=10, so sqrt(2916)*10.

What is sqrt(2916)? Let's see: 54^2=2916 because 50^2=2500 and 54^2= (50+4)^2=2500 + 400 +16=2916.

So sqrt(291600)=54*10=540.

So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, is that it? So the maximum real part is 540.

But wait,
