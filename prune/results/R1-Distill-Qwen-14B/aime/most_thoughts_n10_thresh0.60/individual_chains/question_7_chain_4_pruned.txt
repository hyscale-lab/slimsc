Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then I have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, each vertex is colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So, there are a total of 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. That's the denominator of our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. Wait, I think I need to clarify that. The problem says that after such a rotation, all the blue vertices are now at positions where there were originally red vertices. So, essentially, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices, right?

But wait, since each vertex is colored either red or blue, the set of blue vertices is the complement of the set of red vertices. So, if we can rotate the octagon such that all blue vertices move to where red vertices were, that means the set of blue vertices is a rotation (by some multiple of 45 degrees, since it's an octagon) of the set of red vertices.

Wait, so if the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices, that implies that the set of blue vertices is a shifted version of the red set, right? So, if the octagon is regular, the rotation should map the red set to the blue set. But since the blue set is just the complement of red, this would mean that the octagon is symmetric under that rotation with respect to the coloring. So, the coloring must be rotationally symmetric in some way.

Hmm, but perhaps a better way to think about it is considering the coloring as a binary string of length 8, where each bit is 0 (red) or 1 (blue). Then, a rotation of the octagon corresponds to a cyclic shift of the binary string. The problem is asking for the number of binary strings where after some cyclic shift, all the 1s (blue) are mapped to positions where the original string had 0s (red). 

Wait, that might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as a permutation. Each rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices, and we want that applying this permutation to the blue vertices results in the red vertices. Which would mean that the permutation maps blue to red. But since red is the complement of blue, this is equivalent to saying that the permutation maps each blue vertex to a red one. So, the permutation must send blue to red, which is equivalent to saying that the permutation is a derangement for the blue vertices, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe we can think about the colorings that are fixed under some rotation. But the problem doesn't require the coloring to be fixed; it just requires that after some rotation, the blue vertices are all where the red ones were. So, perhaps the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings
