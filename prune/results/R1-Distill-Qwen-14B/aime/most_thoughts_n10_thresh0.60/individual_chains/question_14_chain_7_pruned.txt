Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again:

"Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let Q and R be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when N is divided by 1000. Find Q+R."

Alright, so I need to find the largest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000, get Q and R, and add them together for the answer.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. Since we're looking for the greatest such N, we probably want the largest possible number, but with the given property. So maybe starting from 9999 and working downward would make sense, but that could take a long time.

But wait, let's think about the property. Whenever one digit is changed to 1, the number is divisible by 7. So, if N is the number, then if I take N's thousands digit and change it to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Similarly, if I change the hundreds, tens, or units digit to 1, each of those resulting numbers must also be divisible by 7.

So, for example, if N is ABCD (digits A, B, C, D), then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, the idea is that for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Therefore, N has this special property where each of these four modified numbers is a multiple of 7.

Our goal is to find the largest N with this property.

Hmm, so maybe we can model this by considering the divisibility conditions for each modified number.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a ≠ 0 since it's a four-digit number.

Now, when we change each digit to 1, we get the following numbers:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's call this number M1.

2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let's call this M2.

3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let's call this M3.

4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let's call this M4.

Each of these M1, M2, M3, M4 must be divisible by 7.

So, M1 ≡ 0 mod 7

M2 ≡ 0 mod 7

M3 ≡ 0 mod 7

M4 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, we can write these as:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm. Let's compute each condition modulo 7.

First, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7:

1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 divided by 7. 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3. So, 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite each condition:

1. M1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d

M1 ≡ 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2. M2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d

M2 ≡ 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3. M3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d

M3 ≡ 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4. M4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

M4 ≡ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So now, we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7  ---> Equation 1

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7 ---> Equation 2

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7 ---> Equation 3

4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 ---> Equation 4

So, we have four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d.

Wait, but a, b, c, d are digits (0-9 for b,c,d; 1-9 for a), so we can think of them as integers in these ranges.

We need to solve this system of equations to find a, b, c, d.

Since N is the greatest four-digit number, we should try to maximize a, then b, then c, then d.

But let's see how we can approach this.

Perhaps we can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let me try subtracting Equation 1 and Equation 2:

Equation 1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(6 - 6a) + (2b - 0) + (3c - 3c) + (d - d) ≡ (0 - 0) mod 7

Simplify:

6(1 - a) + 2b ≡ 0 mod 7

So, 6(1 - a) + 2b ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm, let's factor out 2:

2[3(1 - a) + b] ≡ 0 mod 7.

Since 2 and 7 are coprime, we can divide both sides by 2:

3(1 - a) + b ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 3(1 - a) + b ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which can be rewritten as:

b ≡ 3(a - 1) mod 7.

So, Equation 5: b ≡ 3(a - 1) mod 7.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation 2 and Equation 3:

Equation 2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2:

(6a - 6a) + (2 - 2b) + (3c - 0) + (d - d) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

2 - 2b + 3c ≡ 0 mod 7

Factor:

2(1 - b) + 3c ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm. Maybe we can write this as:

3c ≡ 2(b - 1) mod 7.

So, 3c ≡ 2(b - 1) mod 7.

Equation 6: 3c ≡ 2(b - 1) mod 7.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation 3 and Equation 4:

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3:

(6a - 6a) + (2b - 2b) + (3 - 3c) + (d - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

(3 - 3c) + (d - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Which is:

2 - 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 2 - 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let's rearrange:

d ≡ 3c - 2 mod 7.

Equation 7: d ≡ 3c - 2 mod 7.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation 1 and Equation 4:

Equation 1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Subtract Equation 4 from Equation 1:

(6 - 6a) + (2b - 2b) + (3c - 3c) + (d - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

6(1 - a) + (d - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

So,

6(1 - a) + d - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Which can be written as:

d ≡ 6(a - 1) + 1 mod 7.

Equation 8: d ≡ 6(a - 1) + 1 mod 7.

Wait, from Equation 7, d ≡ 3c - 2 mod 7, and from Equation 8, d ≡ 6(a - 1) + 1 mod 7.

So, 3c - 2 ≡ 6(a - 1) + 1 mod 7.

Let me write this:

3c - 2 ≡ 6
