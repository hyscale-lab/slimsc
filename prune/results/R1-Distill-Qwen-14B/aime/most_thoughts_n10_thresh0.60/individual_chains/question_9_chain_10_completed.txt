Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. And I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but I can use some properties to simplify these expressions. Let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I need to find xy. So maybe if I can find expressions for x and y, I can multiply them together. Let me start with the first equation.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. I know that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that here, I can rewrite the first equation as:

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, that's right. Because log_x(y^x) is the same as x times log_x(y). So, equation 1 becomes:

x * log_x(y) = 10.  — Equation (1)

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the same logarithm property, I can bring down the exponent:

4y * log_y(x) = 10. — Equation (2)

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). That's a key property. Let me denote log_x(y) as k. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So, let's set k = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) = 1/k.

Now, substituting into the equations:

From equation (1):

x * k = 10.  — Equation (1a)

From equation (2):

4y * (1/k) = 10. — Equation (2a)

So, now I have two equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. (4y)/k = 10

I can solve for x and y in terms of k. Let me rearrange both equations.

From equation (1a):

x = 10 / k. — Equation (1b)

From equation (2a):

4y = 10k => y = (10k) / 4 = (5k)/2. — Equation (2b)

So now, both x and y are expressed in terms of k. Now, I need another equation to solve for k. Remember that k is log_x(y). Let me write that down.

k = log_x(y). By definition, this means that x^k = y. — Equation (3)

So, from equation (3), x^k = y. But from equation (2b), y = (5k)/2. So substituting that into equation (3):

x^k = (5k)/2. — Equation (4)

But from equation (1b), x = 10 / k. So substitute x into equation (4):

(10 / k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that's an equation involving k. Let me write that out:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2

This looks a bit complicated, but perhaps taking the natural logarithm on both sides could help. Let's take ln of both sides.

ln[(10/k)^k] = ln[(5k)/2]

Using the property ln(a^b) = b ln(a), the left side becomes k * ln(10/k). So:

k * ln(10/k) = ln(5k/2)

Let me simplify ln(10/k) as ln(10) - ln(k). So, the left side is:

k * (ln(10) - ln(k)) = ln(5k/2)

Expanding the left side:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5k/2)

Now, let's write the right side using logarithm properties. ln(5k/2) is equal to ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2). So:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Let me collect like terms. Let's bring all terms to the left side:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I can factor some terms. Let's see.

I have terms with ln(k):

(-k ln(k) - ln(k)) = -ln(k)(k + 1)

And the other terms:

k ln(10) + ln(2) - ln(5)

So, rewriting:

-ln(k)(k + 1) + k ln(10) + ln(2) - ln(5) = 0

Let me rearrange:

k ln(10) - (k + 1) ln(k) + (ln(2) - ln(5)) = 0

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which probably doesn't have an algebraic solution. Maybe I can find a value of k that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the substitution. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, when I substituted x and y in terms of k, let me make sure I did that correctly.

From equation (3): x^k = y

From equation (2b): y = (5k)/2

So, x^k = (5k)/2.

But x = 10/k, so substituting:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2

Yes, that's correct.

So, (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write (10/k)^k as (10^k)/(k^k). So:

10^k / k^k = (5k)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

2 * 10^k / k^k = 5k

Divide both sides by 5:

(2/5) * (10^k) / k^k = k

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write 10 as 2*5.

So, 10^k = (2*5)^k = 2^k * 5^k.

So, substituting back into the equation:

(2^k * 5^k) / k^k = (5k)/2

Multiply both sides by k^k:

2^k * 5^k = (5k/2) * k^k

Simplify the right side:

(5k/2) * k^k = (5/2) * k^{k+1}

So, 2^k * 5^k = (5/2) * k^{k+1}

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

(2^k * 5^k) / (k^{k+1}) = 5/2

Divide both sides by 5:

(2^k * 5^{k-1}) / k^{k+1} = 1/2

Wait, not sure if that helps either. Maybe trying specific values for k.

Since x and y are both greater than 1, and k is log_x(y), which, since y > 1 and x > 1, k could be greater than 1 or between 0 and 1 depending on whether y is greater than x or not.

Wait, but log_x(y) is k. So if x and y are both greater than 1, if y > x, then k > 1. If y < x, then 0 < k < 1.

But let me think about possible integer values for k to see if they satisfy the equation.

Let me try k=2.

Check equation: (10/2)^2 = (5*2)/2 => 5^2 = 10/2 => 25 = 5? No, 25 ≠5.

k=2 doesn't work.

How about k=3?

(10/3)^3 = (5*3)/2 => (1000/27) ≈37.037 ≈15/2=7.5. Nope, 37 ≠7.5.

k=4?

(10/4)^4 = (5*4)/2 => (2.5)^4 = 10. (2.5)^4 is 39.0625, which is not 10.

k=1?

(10/1)^1 = (5*1)/2 => 10 = 2.5. No.

k=5?

(10/5)^5 = (5*5)/2 => 2^5=25/2 =>32=12.5. No.

k=0.5?

(10/0.5)^0.5 = (5*0.5)/2 => 20^0.5 = (2.5)/2 => sqrt(20) ≈4.472 ≈1.25. Not equal.

k=0.2?

Wait, k=0.2 is 1/5.

(10/(1/5))^(1/5) = (5*(1/5))/2 => (50)^(1/5)= (1)/2. 50^(0.2) is about 2.378, which is not 0.5.

Hmm, not working. Maybe k is not an integer. Perhaps I can make a substitution to find k.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of trying to solve for k directly, I can relate x and y through another equation.

Wait, since I have x = 10/k and y =5k/2, and x^k = y, let's substitute x and y in that.

x^k = y => (10/k)^k = 5k/2.

So, (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

I can write this as (10^k)/(k^k) = (5k)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

2*10^k / k^k =5k.

Divide both sides by 5:

(2/5)*(10^k)/(k^k) =k.

Hmm, perhaps taking the natural logarithm again.

Take ln of both sides:

ln[(2/5) * (10^k / k^k)] = ln(k)

Which is ln(2/5) + ln(10^k) - ln(k^k) = ln(k)

Simplify each term:

ln(2) - ln(5) + k ln(10) -k ln(k) = ln(k)

So:

ln(2) - ln(5) + k ln(10) -k ln(k) - ln(k) = 0

Combine like terms:

k ln(10) - (k +1) ln(k) + (ln(2) - ln(5)) =0

Which is the same as before. So I'm back to the same equation.

Maybe I can factor this equation or find some substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let t = k, and write the equation as:

t ln(10) - (t +1) ln(t) + (ln(2) - ln(5)) =0

It's a bit messy, but perhaps I can define a function f(t) = t ln(10) - (t +1) ln(t) + ln(2/5), and try to find t such that f(t)=0.

Maybe I can use numerical methods here. Let me see if I can approximate t.

I can try different t values to approximate.

Let me try t=2:

f(2)=2 ln(10) -3 ln(2) + ln(2/5)

Calculate:

ln(10)=2.302585, ln(2)=0.693147, ln(2/5)=ln(0.4)= -0.916291

f(2)=2*2.302585 -3*0.693147 -0.916291 ≈4.60517 -2.07944 -0.916291≈4.60517-2.99573≈1.60944>0.

So f(2)=~1.609>0.

t=3:

f(3)=3*2.302585 -4*ln(3) + ln(2/5)

ln(3)=1.098612

f(3)=6.907755 -4*1.098612 -0.916291≈6.907755 -4.39445 -0.916291≈6.907755 -5.31074≈1.597>0.

t=4:

f(4)=4*2.302585 -5*ln(4) + ln(2/5)

ln(4)=1.386294

f(4)=9.21034 -5*1.386294 -0.916291≈9.21034 -6.93147 -0.916291≈9.21034 -7.84776≈1.36258>0.

t=5:

f(5)=5*2.302585 -6*ln(5) + ln(2/5)

ln(5)=1.609438

f(5)=11.512925 -6*1.609438 -0.916291≈11.512925 -9.656628 -0.916291≈11.512925 -10.57292≈0.94>0.

t=6:

f(6)=6*2.302585 -7*ln(6) + ln(2/5)

ln(6)=1.791759

f(6)=13.81551 -7*1.791759 -0.916291≈13.81551 -12.54231 -0.916291≈13.81551 -13.4586≈0.3569>0.

t=7:

f(7)=7*2.302585 -8*ln(7) + ln(2/5)

ln(7)=1.94591

f(7)=16.118095 -8*1.94591 -0.916291≈16.118095 -15.56728 -0.916291≈16.118095 -16.48357≈-0.3655<0.

So f(7) is negative.

So between t=6 and t=7, f(t) goes from positive to negative. So the root is between 6 and 7.

Let me try t=6.5:

f(6.5)=6.5*2.302585 -7.5*ln(6.5) + ln(2/5)

Compute each term:

6.5*2.302585≈14.9668

ln(6.5)=1.87179

7.5*1.87179≈14.0384

ln(2/5)=ln(0.4)≈-0.916291

So:

14.9668 -14.0384 -0.916291≈14.9668 -14.9547≈0.0121>0.

So f(6.5)≈0.0121>0.

t=6.5 gives f(t)=~0.0121. Close to zero.

Let me try t=6.51:

f(6.51)=6.51*2.302585 -7.51*ln(6.51) + ln(2/5)

Calculate:

6.51*2.302585≈6*2.302585=13.81551, 0.51*2.302585≈1.174318. Total≈14.9898.

ln(6.51)=ln(6.5)+ln(1.001538)≈1.87179 +0.001536≈1.873326

7.51*1.873326≈7*1.873326=13.113282, 0.51*1.873326≈0.955496. Total≈14.06878.

So:

14.9898 -14.06878 -0.916291≈14.9898 -14.98507≈0.00473>0.

t=6.51 gives f(t)=~0.00473>0.

t=6.52:

6.52*2.302585≈6*2.302585=13.81551, 0.52*2.302585≈1.19739. Total≈15.0129.

ln(6.52)=ln(6.5)+ln(1.003077)≈1.87179 +0.003075≈1.874865.

7.52*1.874865≈7*1.874865=13.124055, 0.52*1.874865≈0.97333. Total≈14.097385.

So,

15.0129 -14.097385 -0.916291≈15.0129 -15.013676≈-0.000776<0.

So f(6.52)≈-0.000776.

So between t=6.51 and t=6.52, f(t) crosses zero.

Let me use linear approximation.

At t=6.51, f=0.00473.

At t=6.52, f≈-0.000776.

The change is delta_t=0.01, delta_f≈-0.005506.

We need to find t where f(t)=0 between 6.51 and 6.52.

Let the root be at t=6.51 + d, where d is small.

We have:

f(6.51)=0.00473

f(6.52)= -0.000776

The difference in f is -0.005506 over delta_t=0.01.

We need to find d such that 0.00473 - (0.005506/0.01)*d =0.

So,

0.00473 - 0.5506*d=0

=> 0.5506*d=0.00473

=> d= 0.00473 /0.5506≈0.0086.

So t≈6.51 +0.0086≈6.5186.

So, approx t≈6.5186.

So, k≈6.5186.

Now, with k≈6.5186, I can find x and y.

From equation (1b), x=10/k≈10/6.5186≈1.534.

From equation (2b), y=(5k)/2≈(5*6.5186)/2≈(32.593)/2≈16.2965.

Wait, but we can check if these satisfy the original equations.

Check equation 1: log_x(y^x)=10.

Compute y^x: 16.2965^1.534.

Hmm, let me compute log base x of y^x. Which is 10, according to the problem.

Wait, since y^x is (x^k)^x =x^{k x}.

Wait, but x=10/k, so x^{k x}= (10/k)^{k*(10/k)}= (10/k)^{10}.

So, y^x = (10/k)^{10}.

So, log_x(y^x)= log_x( (10/k)^10 )=10 * log_x(10/k)=10.

Which is, log_x(10/k)=1, because 10*log_x(10/k)=10 implies log_x(10/k)=1.

Which means, x^1=10/k => x=10/k, which is consistent with equation (1b). So that's correct.

Similarly, equation 2: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

x^{4y} = (10/k)^{4*(5k/2)}= (10/k)^{10k}.

So, log_y(x^{4y})= log_y( (10/k)^{10k} )=10k * log_y(10/k).

Which equals 10, so 10k * log_y(10/k)=10.

Divide both sides by 10: k * log_y(10/k)=1.

But log_y(10/k)= log_y( (5k/2)^{-1} ), since 10/k = (5k/2)^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, since y=5k/2, log_y(10/k)= log_{5k/2}(10/k).

Let me compute this:

log_{5k/2}(10/k) = [ln(10/k)] / [ln(5k/2)].

But from equation (1a): x*k=10, x=10/k, which is consistent.

Wait, perhaps I can express ln(10/k) as ln(10) - ln(k).

Similarly, ln(5k/2)= ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2).

So, log_y(10/k)= [ln(10) - ln(k)] / [ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)].

So, the equation is:

k * [ (ln(10) - ln(k)) / (ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2) ) ] =1.

So,

k [ ln(10) - ln(k) ] = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2).

Which is the same as our earlier equation after substituting k.

So, that's consistent.

So, with k≈6.5186, we have x≈1.534 and y≈16.2965.

But wait, the problem is to find xy.

So, x≈1.534, y≈16.2965. So, xy≈1.534 *16.2965≈25.

Wait, that's interesting. 25?

Because 1.534 *16.2965 ≈1.534*16=24.544, and 1.534*0.2965≈0.455, so total≈24.544 +0.455≈25.

So, xy≈25.

Wait, that's a nice integer. So, perhaps the exact value is 25, and my approximations are leading to that.

So, maybe the exact value of xy is 25.

Wait, let me see if that's the case.

If xy=25, then perhaps x=5 and y=5, but wait, in that case, let's check the equations.

If x=5 and y=5:

log_5(5^5)=5*log_5(5)=5*1=5≠10. So that doesn't work.

Wait, so x and y can't both be 5.

Wait, but 25 is the product. Let me try to see if x=2.5 and y=10.

x=2.5, y=10.

Check equation 1: log_{2.5}(10^{2.5})=10^{2.5} is 10*sqrt(10)= about 31.62.

Wait, log_{2.5}(31.62)=?

We can compute log_{2.5}(31.62)= ln(31.62)/ln(2.5).

ln(31.62)=3.454, ln(2.5)=0.916.

3.454 /0.916≈3.77≈10? No.

Hmm, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe x=2 and y=12.5.

Wait, but x must be greater than 1, y as well.

Wait, perhaps the exact solution is 25, so let me check if xy=25.

If I assume that xy=25, then y=25/x.

So, let me substitute y=25/x into the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Which is log_x( (25/x)^x )=10.

Simplify:

log_x(25^x /x^x )=10.

Which is log_x(25^x) - log_x(x^x)=10.

Which is x log_x(25) -x=10.

Factor x:

x*(log_x(25) -1)=10.

Similarly, log_x(25)= ln(25)/ln(x).

So, x*(ln(25)/ln(x) -1)=10.

Let me write this as x*(ln(25) - ln(x))/ln(x) )=10.

Which is x*(ln(25/x))/ln(x)=10.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let me use equation 2:

log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Since y=25/x, this becomes log_{25/x}(x^{4*(25/x)} )=10.

Simplify the exponent: 4*(25/x)=100/x.

So, log_{25/x}(x^{100/x})=10.

Which is equal to (100/x) * log_{25/x}(x)=10.

Because log_b(a^c)=c log_b(a).

So, (100/x) * log_{25/x}(x) =10.

But log_{25/x}(x)= 1 / log_x(25/x).

Because log_b(a)=1/log_a(b).

So, log_{25/x}(x)=1 / log_x(25/x).

Compute log_x(25/x):

log_x(25) - log_x(x)= log_x(25) -1.

So, log_{25/x}(x)=1/( log_x(25) -1 ).

So, equation (2) becomes:

(100/x) * [1/( log_x(25)-1 ) ] =10.

Multiply both sides by (log_x(25)-1):

(100/x) =10*( log_x(25)-1 ).

Divide both sides by 10:

10/x = log_x(25) -1.

So, log_x(25) =10/x +1.

Now, from equation (1), we had:

log_x(25) -1 =10/(x*k) ?

Wait, no, let me recall equation (1):

After substitution, equation (1) led to x*(log_x(25) -1 )=10.

Wait, no, earlier when I assumed y=25/x, equation (1) became:

x*(log_x(25) -1 )=10.

So, equation (1a): x*(log_x(25) -1 )=10.

And equation (2a): 10/x = log_x(25)-1.

So, equation (2a) gives log_x(25)=10/x +1.

Substitute into equation (1a):

x*( (10/x +1 ) -1 )=10.

Simplify:

x*(10/x )=10.

Which is 10=10. So, it's an identity.

So, as long as xy=25, the equations are satisfied.

Therefore, xy=25 is the solution.

So, the answer is 25.


Given the equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

We start by using logarithm properties to simplify both equations. For the first equation:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Let \(k = \log_x(y)\). Then, the equation becomes:

\[
x \cdot k = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{10}{k}
\]

For the second equation:

\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{\log_x(y)} = \frac{1}{k}\), the equation becomes:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{5k}{2}
\]

Now, using the relationship \(x^k = y\) (from the definition of logarithms), substitute \(x = \frac{10}{k}\) and \(y = \frac{5k}{2}\):

\[
\left(\frac{10}{k}\right)^k = \frac{5k}{2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{10^k}{k^k} = \frac{5k}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2 \cdot 10^k = 5k \cdot k^k
\]

This equation is transcendental, but we can solve it numerically or recognize that \(xy = 25\) satisfies both original equations. Thus, the product \(xy\) is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
