Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to picture it. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, and all the opposite sides are parallel. That means AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA, right? Also, it's equilateral, so all the sides are equal in length. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

The problem says that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. Hmm, that's interesting. So, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with those particular lengths. I guess I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon's side length.

Since it's a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, I think it might be related to a larger triangle, and the hexagon is like a "truncated" version of this triangle. Maybe the hexagon is inside the triangle, and each side of the triangle is extended to form the hexagon. That makes sense because extending those sides would create intersections that form the hexagon's vertices.

Wait, so if AB, CD, and EF are extended to form a triangle, this triangle is larger than the hexagon. The hexagon is somehow inscribed within this triangle, with each pair of opposite sides lying on parallel lines that are inside the triangle.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal. Let me denote the side length as 's'. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon must have a sort of symmetry.

I remember that in such cases, the triangle formed by the extensions can be divided into smaller similar triangles. Maybe the hexagon can be thought of as the intersection of three smaller similar triangles within the larger triangle. Or perhaps each side of the hexagon creates a similar triangle within the larger one.

Another thought: maybe the hexagon divides each side of the larger triangle into segments proportional to something. Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the ratios of the segments on each side of the larger triangle might be the same.

Let's try to visualize this. Let's say the larger triangle is triangle T with sides 200, 240, and 300. The hexagon is inside T, and each side of T is extended from sides of the hexagon.

Since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides would create a smaller similar triangle when extended. So, for example, extending AB and DE (which are parallel) would meet at a point forming a smaller triangle at the top of the larger triangle T. Similarly, extending BC and EF (parallel) would form another smaller triangle on the left, and extending CD and FA (parallel) would form another on the right.

Wait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the extensions of AB, CD, EF meet to form triangle T, so each of these sides is a side of the hexagon and also a side of this larger triangle when extended. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF beyond the hexagon's vertices. So, if I extend AB beyond A and B
