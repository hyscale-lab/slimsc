Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number, N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. Since we're looking for the greatest such number, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find the number that satisfies the condition.

But wait, checking each number one by one would take forever. There must be a smarter way to approach this.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So for each digit in N, if we replace it with 1, the new number should be a multiple of 7.

Let me denote the four digits of N as a, b, c, d. So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Each of a, b, c, d can be digits from 0 to 9, but since it's a four-digit number, a can't be zero.

So, when we change the first digit a to 1, the number becomes 1bcd, which is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing the second digit b to 1 gives us a1cd, which is 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. That must also be divisible by 7.

Same for changing the third digit c to 1: ab1d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. And changing the fourth digit d to 1: abc1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1.

Each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7. So, we have four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, this seems a bit complex. Maybe I can simplify each of these modulo 7.

First, I should figure out what 1000, 100, 10, and 1 are modulo 7 because that will help me compute each condition more easily.

Calculating:

7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. Therefore, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 ÷ 7 is 14 with a remainder of 2, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ÷ 7 is 1 with remainder 3, so 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

And 1 mod 7 is just 1.

So each condition can be rewritten modulo 7.

Let me write each condition:

1. (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) ≡ (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. (1000a + 100 + 10c + d) ≡ (6a + 2 + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. (1000a + 100b + 10 + d) ≡ (6a + 2b + 3 + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. (1000a + 100b + 10c + 1) ≡ (6a + 2b + 3c + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

So now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), (3), (4) respectively.

So we have four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d (digits, so 0-9, a ≠ 0).

Our goal is to find the largest four-digit number N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d that satisfies all four equations.

Hmm, this seems manageable. Maybe we can express some variables in terms of others.

Let me see:

From equation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7 → 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod7 (since -6 ≡ 1 mod7)

From equation (2): 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod7 → 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod7 (since -2 ≡ 5 mod7)

From equation (3): 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod7 → 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod7 (since -3 ≡ 4 mod7)

From equation (4): 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod7 → 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod7 (since -1 ≡ 6 mod7)

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Looking at equations (1) and (4):

Equation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod7

Equation (4): 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod7

If I subtract equation (1) from equation (4), I get:

(6a + 2b + 3c) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 6 - 1 mod7

Simplify:

6a - d ≡ 5 mod7

So 6a - d ≡5 mod7 → d ≡6a -5 mod7

Similarly, maybe subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

Equation (3): 6a + 2b + d ≡4 mod7

Equation (2):6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7

Subtract (3)-(2):

(6a + 2b + d) - (6a + 3c + d) ≡4 -5 mod7

Simplify:

2b -3c ≡-1 mod7 → 2b -3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 ≡6 mod7)

So now we have another equation:

5. 2b -3c ≡6 mod7

Let me note that.

So now, from equation (5): 2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

Also, from equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

And from equation (4): 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Wait, maybe I can express 2b from equation (5):

From (5): 2b ≡6 +3c mod7.

So 2b =6 +3c +7k, where k is some integer.

But since b is a digit (0-9), 2b can be 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18.

Similarly, 3c can be 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27.

So 2b =6 +3c mod7, but let's think about 2b -3c =6 mod7.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express d in terms of a.

From equation (1): d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

From the earlier subtraction, we had d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So, combining these two:

6a -5 ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

But from equation (5): 2b -3c ≡6 mod7 → 2b =3c +6 mod7.

Substituting into the above equation:

6a -5 ≡1 - (3c +6) -3c mod7.

Wait, perhaps I should do it step by step.

We have:

From equation (1): d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

From equation (something else): d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So setting them equal:

1 -2b -3c ≡6a -5 mod7.

Simplify:

(1 +5) -2b -3c ≡6a mod7 → 6 ≡6a +2b +3c mod7.

Wait, that's equation (2): 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Wait, but 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7. If I substitute d from equation (1):

6a +3c + (1 -2b -3c) ≡5 mod7.

Simplify:

6a +3c +1 -2b -3c ≡5 →6a -2b
