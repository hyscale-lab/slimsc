Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense.

First, let me write down the expression clearly:

Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z]

And we know that |z| = 4, which means that z is a complex number lying on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. So, z can be represented as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can write z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Maybe that's a good starting point.

Let me set z = 4e^{iθ} because it might make the substitution easier. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because the reciprocal of e^{iθ} is e^{-iθ}, and 1/|z| is 1/4.

So, substituting z and 1/z into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}

Second part: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So, the entire expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, let me compute 4*(75 + 117i) and (24 + 36i):

4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i

24 + 36i is already there.

So the expression is:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, let me express these in terms of sine and cosine. Remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, expanding each term:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i + 468 (-1) sinθ
= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i + 36 sinθ
= (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

Now, adding these two terms together:

Real parts:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

But since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can ignore the imaginary part. So, the real part is:

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Wait, is that all? Hmm, that's interesting. So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ) or C sin(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude, which is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, the maximum value of such an expression is C.

So, in our case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me write this as:

324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ

So, A = 324, B = -432.

Then, the amplitude C is sqrt(A^2 + B^2) = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2)

Let me compute that:

324^2: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and the cross term is 2*300*24 = 14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 90000 is 90k, 90k +14.4k is 104.4k, +576 is 104976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2 = 160000, 32^2=1024, and cross term 2*400*32=25600. So, (400+32)^2=160000 +25600 +1024= 160,000 +25,600=185,600 +1,024= 186,624. But since B is -432, it's squared will be same as 432^2, so positive.

So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600)

Hmm, sqrt(291600). Let's see: 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2=291,600 (because 54^2=2916, so 540^2=291600). So, sqrt(291600)=540.

So, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait a second, that's the maximum. So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because it's easy to make a mistake with the signs or somewhere in the algebra.

Starting from the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z|=4.

Set z=4e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Substituted and expanded correctly:

First term: 4*(75 +117i)e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 +144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = (24 +36i)e^{-iθ}

Then expanded both:

First term: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + imaginary part.

Second term: (24 cosθ +36 sinθ) + imaginary part.

Adding real parts: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = (324 cosθ -432 sinθ). That seems correct.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Then, that's equivalent to A cosθ + B sinθ with A=324, B=-432.

Amplitude C = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600)=540.

So, yes, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but another way to think about this is using vectors. The expression 324 cosθ -432 sinθ can be thought of as the dot product of the vector (324, -432) with the vector (cosθ, sinθ). The maximum value of the dot product is the magnitude of the vector (324, -432), which is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = 540. So that's another way to see it.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider another approach, perhaps using complex analysis. Let's think about the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Let me denote w = z, so |w| =4. Then, the expression becomes (75 +117i)w + (96+144i)/w.

Let me write this as (75 +117i)w + (96+144i) \overline{w}/|w|^2.

But since |w|=4, |w|^2=16, so:

(75 +117i)w + (96+144i)(\overline{w})/16.

Expressed in terms of w and its conjugate. Hmm, not sure if that helps, but let me proceed.

We can write w = a + bi, and \overline{w} = a - bi, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since w =4 e^{iθ}, which is what I did earlier, it's perhaps more straightforward.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe to write the expression in terms of w + something, but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps to write the expression as a sum of two complex numbers, each scaled by w and 1/w, and then see if that can be expressed as a single complex number multiplied by w or something.

Wait, let me think about the expression:

(75 +117i) w + (96 +144i)/w.

Let me factor out w from both terms:

w [ (75 +117i) + (96 +144i)/w^2 ].

Hmm, but w^2 would be |w|^2 e^{i2θ} =16 e^{i2θ}, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe to represent the expression as a single fraction:

(75 +117i)w^2 + (96 +144i) all over w.

But since |w|=4, w isn't zero, so that's valid. Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps to set w = 4 e^{iθ} as before, then w =4 e^{iθ}, so 1/w = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression is:

(75 +117i) *4 e^{iθ} + (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Which is the same as 4*(75 +117i)e^{iθ} + (24 +36i)e^{-iθ}.

Which is what I did earlier. So, perhaps my initial approach is the way to go.

But wait, another thought: Maybe to write this as a combination of e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}, which are like cosine and sine terms. So, essentially, the real part is a combination of cosθ and sinθ, which I can write as a single sinusoidal function, whose maximum amplitude is the maximum value.

So, as I did earlier, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So, the maximum value is the amplitude, sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) =540.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should write it as R cos(θ + φ) and find R.

So, 324 cosθ -432 sinθ = R cos(θ + φ).

Using the identity: A cosθ + B sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and tanφ = B/A.

Wait, in our case, it's 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, so B is negative. So, A=324, B=-432.

So, R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) =540.

Then, tanφ = B/A = (-432)/324.

Simplify that: 432/324 = 16/12 =4/3. So, tanφ= -4/3.

Which means φ is in the fourth quadrant, since tan is negative.

But when we write it as R cos(θ + φ), the maximum value is R, which is 540.

So yes, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, let me think if I can get it another way.

Alternatively, perhaps using calculus. Let me consider the expression 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Let me denote f(θ) =324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

To find the maximum of f(θ), take the derivative f’(θ) and set it to zero.

f’(θ) = -324 sinθ -432 cosθ.

Set to zero: -324 sinθ -432 cosθ=0 → 324 sinθ +432 cosθ=0.

Divide both sides by 108: 3 sinθ +4 cosθ=0.

So, 3 sinθ = -4 cosθ → tanθ= -4/3.

So, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant where tanθ is negative.

So, θ = arctan(-4/3). Let me compute the value.

But I don't need the exact theta, just to know where the maximum occurs. Since the maximum of f(theta) is R, which is 540, as found earlier.

Thus, the maximum is indeed 540.

Wait a second, but just to make sure, let me plug θ where tanθ= -4/3 into f(theta) and see if it gives 540.

Let me consider θ such that tanθ= -4/3.

So, sinθ = -4/5 (if θ is in the fourth quadrant) and cosθ=3/5.

Alternatively, if θ is in the second quadrant, sinθ=4/5 and cosθ=-3/5.

But let me compute f(theta) for both cases.

Case 1: θ in fourth quadrant.

sinθ= -4/5, cosθ=3/5.

f(theta)=324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5=2700/5=540.

Case 2: θ in second quadrant.

sinθ=4/5, cosθ=-3/5.

f(theta)=324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5)= (-972 -1728)/5= (-2700)/5= -540.

So, clearly, the maximum is 540, and the minimum is -540. So, yes, the maximum is 540.

Thus, the largest possible real part is 540. I think that's the answer.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). This gives \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z\) and \(1/z\) into the expression:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4} \cdot e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplify each term:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}
\]
\[
\frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \quad \Rightarrow \quad (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding both terms using Euler's formula \(e^{\pm i\theta} = \cos\theta \pm i\sin\theta\):

\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)
\]
\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
\]

Adding the real parts:

\[
300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

The real part of the expression is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). To find its maximum value, we recognize this as a sinusoidal function of the form \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), whose amplitude is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Here, \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\), so:

\[
\text{Amplitude} = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
