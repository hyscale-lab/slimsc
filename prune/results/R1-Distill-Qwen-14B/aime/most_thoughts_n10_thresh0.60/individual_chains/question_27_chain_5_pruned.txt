Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it and understand what's being asked.

First, the torus T is described as the surface formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle. The axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, imagine a donut shape where the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3. Got it.

Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem mentions two scenarios: when T rests on the inside of S and when it rests on the outside. In both cases, they're tangent along a circle, and we need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference, which is r_i - r_o. The answer should be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so I need to find r_i and r_o. Let me think about how a torus can be tangent to a sphere both internally and externally.

When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, it's like the torus is sitting inside the sphere and just touching it at a circle. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, the torus is outside the sphere and tangent along another circle.

To model this, I should probably consider the geometry of the torus and how it relates to the sphere. Let me recall that a torus can be defined by two radii: R, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution (which is 6 in this case), and r, the radius of the generating circle (which is 3). So, R = 6 and r = 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11. The torus must fit such that the farthest point on the torus from the center of the sphere is exactly equal to the sphere's radius. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center must equal the sphere's radius.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the point of tangency would be a circle. So, the sphere and torus share a common tangent circle. The same goes for when the torus is outside.

I think I need to model the centers of these tangent circles and find their radii. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.

Let's assume the center of the sphere S is at the origin (0,0,0). Now, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from its center. Let's orient the torus such that its axis lies along the z-axis for simplicity, but wait, no, because the sphere is 3D, perhaps it's better to model the axis along another direction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in 2D first, perhaps an axial cross-section. So, imagine a cross-section through the axis of the torus and the center of the sphere.

In this cross-section, the torus would appear as two circles (like a figure-eight shape). The sphere, in cross-section, would be a circle with radius 11.

Wait, no. In cross-section, the torus may appear as a circle of radius R + r and another of radius R - r, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the torus in 3D.

Wait, okay, let's think in 3D. The torus can be represented parametrically, but maybe I should model the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's points of tangency.

Wait, perhaps using the
