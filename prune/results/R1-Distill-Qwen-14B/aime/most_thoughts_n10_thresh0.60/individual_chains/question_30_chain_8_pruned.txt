Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, roots of unity... I remember those are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. Since it's the 13th root, ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1, so it's one of the primitive roots.

First, let me write down the product:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I need to compute this product. It might help to rewrite the terms inside the product in a different form. Let me look at each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten as (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Maybe that's a quadratic in ω^k? Let me see. If I let x = ω^k, then the term becomes x^2 - 2x + 2. So each term is a quadratic in x, which is a 13th root of unity.

But since ω^k are the roots of the equation x^13 - 1 = 0, except ω^0 = 1. So, for each k from 0 to 12, ω^k is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0. Maybe I can relate this product to a polynomial whose roots are ω^k.

Wait, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x^13 - 1. But in our case, each term is a quadratic in ω^k. So the product becomes Product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Maybe I can consider this as evaluating some polynomial at specific points.

Alternatively, since each term is a quadratic
