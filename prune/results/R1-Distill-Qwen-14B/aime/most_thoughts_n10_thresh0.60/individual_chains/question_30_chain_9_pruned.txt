Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. Here, ω is a 13th root, so ω^13 = 1. Also, since ω ≠ 1, we're dealing with the primitive roots.

The product is from k=0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity. Each term in the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor or simplify each term.

Let me write each term as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me see if this can be rewritten. Maybe factor out something? Let's see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k for simplicity. Then the term becomes x² - 2x + 2. So, each term is x² - 2x + 2 where x is ω^k.

So, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k. Since ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity, maybe we can relate this to a polynomial whose roots are these x.

Wait, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (z - ω^k) is the minimal polynomial for ω. But here, the terms are quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can relate this product to the evaluation of a certain polynomial at specific points?

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as a product over all 13th roots of unity of (x² - 2x + 2). Since x = ω^k, which are the roots of the equation x^13 = 1. So, maybe I can think in terms of polynomials.

Let me consider the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1. This polynomial factors as f(x) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k). So, the product over (x - ω^k) is x^13 - 1. But in our case, we have the product over (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Hmm, that's a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the term as (x² - 2x + 2) for x = ω^k. Maybe we can write this as (x^2 - 2x + 2) = (x - a)(x - b), but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps consider that (x² - 2x + 2) is related to (x - 1)^2 + 1, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: consider the product over all k of (x^2 - 2x + 2) where x are the 13th roots of unity. So, the product would be the product over all x^13 =1 of (x² - 2x + 2). So, that is equal to the product over all x ≠1 of (x² - 2x + 2), since when k=0, x=ω^0=1, so that term is (1 - 2
