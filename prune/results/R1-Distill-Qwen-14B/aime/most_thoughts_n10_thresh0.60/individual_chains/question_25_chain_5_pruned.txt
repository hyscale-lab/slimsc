Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and what they own. Hmm, let me try to parse this out. 

Alright, there are 900 residents total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which I guess is like a given because it says "each." Then, there are some other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 for diamond rings, 367 for golf clubs, and 562 for garden spades. 

Wait, and then there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things. Oh, and 234 who own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four: the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. 

So, let's think about how to approach this. It seems like a problem involving sets and their overlaps. I remember something about using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for these kinds of problems. Let me try to recall.

Inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the total number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections. The formula for three sets, for example, is:

Total = A + B + C - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC

But wait, in this case, we have four things, but one of them is a given (candy hearts). So, every resident owns a candy heart. That's like saying S, the universal set, is the set of residents who own candy hearts. So, all the other sets (diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades) are subsets of S.

So, maybe I can model this as three sets: D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), and Sg (garden spades), all within the universal set U (candy hearts). 

We need to find the number of residents who own all four, which would be the intersection of D, G, Sg, and U. But since U is everyone, that's just the intersection of D, G, and Sg. So, we're looking for |D ∩ G ∩ Sg|.

But how do we get that?

I remember that in inclusion-exclusion, for three sets, the formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ Sg| = |D| + |G| + |Sg| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ Sg| - |G ∩ Sg| + |D ∩ G ∩ Sg|

But wait, in this problem, the total number of residents is 900, and everyone owns candy hearts, so the union of D, G, and Sg is the entire population. Because even if someone doesn't own any of D, G, or Sg, they still own candy hearts. Wait, no, actually, the union of D, G, and Sg would be the number of people who own at least one of those three items. But since the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, the union of D, G, Sg isn't
