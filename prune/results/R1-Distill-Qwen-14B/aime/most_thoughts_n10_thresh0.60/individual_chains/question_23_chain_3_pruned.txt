Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's right. So, they intersect at 90 degrees and cut each other exactly in half.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.

Now, the diagonals are AC and BD. Since they intersect at the origin, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). So, the diagonals are AC and BD.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let me check that. If the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD would be (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. For them to be perpendicular, (y/x) * (q/p) = -1. So, (y q)/(x p) = -1. That gives y q = -x p. So, y q + x p = 0. That's one condition.

Also, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, for point A
