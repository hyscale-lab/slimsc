Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special thing about N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that fits the condition.

The condition is that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. All four of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Wait, but since N is the largest possible, maybe there's a pattern or rule that can help me find N without checking every number. Because checking each number one by one from 9999 downwards might take too long.

Let me think about the digits. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = a b c d, where a is the thousands digit, b is the hundreds, c is the tens, and d is the ones digit.

So, the four modified numbers are:

1. 1 b c d
2. a 1 c d
3. a b 1 d
4. a b c 1

Each of these must be divisible by 7. So, each of these modified numbers when divided by 7 gives no remainder.

I need to find a, b, c, d such that:

- 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
- 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
- 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
- 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I can express each modified number in terms of N.

Let me see:

1. Changing the thousands digit to 1: That would be 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d. Let me call this M1.

2. Changing the hundreds digit to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d. M2.

3. Changing the tens digit to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d. M3.

4. Changing the ones digit to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. M4.

Each M1, M2, M3, M4 must be divisible by 7.

So, I can write each of these modulo 7.

First, let's compute N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

But for M1, M2, M3, M4, they are derived from N by changing one digit to 1.

So:

M1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's express M1 in terms of N:

M1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + (N - 1000a - 100b - 10c - d) + 1000a.

Wait, that might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, M1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = N - (1000a) + 1000*1.

Wait, because in N, the thousands digit is a, so changing it to 1 reduces the number by 1000a - 1000*1 = 1000(a - 1). So, M1 = N - 1000(a - 1) = N - 1000a + 1000 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

Similarly, M
