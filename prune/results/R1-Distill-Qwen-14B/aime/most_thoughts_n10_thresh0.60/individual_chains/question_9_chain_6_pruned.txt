Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the value of xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but let's take it step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be simplified using some properties. For the first equation, log_x(y^x), I think the exponent can come out in front. So, log_x(y^x) is equal to x times log_x(y), right? So equation 1 becomes:

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}), the exponent 4y should come out front. So that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So equation 2 is:

4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to solve for x and y. Maybe I can express both equations in terms of a common variable or relate log_x(y) and log_y(x). I recall that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as some variable to make it easier, say, k. So, let's set k = log_y(x). Then, log_x(y) would be 1/k.

Substituting back into equation 1, we have:

x * (1/k) = 10 → x = 10k.

And equation 2 is 4y * k = 10. So, 4y * k = 10.

But I also know that k = log_y(x). Since x = 10k, this becomes k = log_y(10k). Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me think about how to handle this.

Wait, log_y(10k) can be written using the change of base formula. Remember, log_b(a) = ln a / ln b. So, log_y(10k) = ln(10k) / ln y. But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can express y in terms of k as well.

From equation 2: 4y * k = 10, so y = 10 / (4k) = 5/(2k).

So now, I have x = 10k and y = 5/(2k). And I also know that k = log_y(x). Let's substitute x and y into that.

k = log_y(x) = log_{5/(2k)}(10k).

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can write this logarithm in terms of natural logs or common logs.

Using the change of base formula again:

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))].

Let me write that out:

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))].

This is an equation in terms of k. Let me see if I can simplify it.

First, let me denote ln(10k) as A and ln(5/(2k)) as B. So, k = A/B.

But I can express A and B in terms of ln(10), ln(k), etc.

A = ln(10k) = ln 10 + ln k.

B = ln(5/(2k)) = ln 5 - ln(2k) = ln 5 - (ln 2 + ln k).

So, substituting back into k = A/B:

k = (ln 10 + ln k) / (ln 5 - ln 2 - ln k).

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can set t = ln k. Let me try that substitution.

Let t = ln k. Then, ln k = t.

So, A = ln 10 + t.

B = ln 5 - ln 2 - t.

So the equation becomes:

k = (ln 10 + t) / (ln 5 - ln 2 - t).

But k is equal to e^t, since t = ln k. So:

e^t = (ln 10 + t) / (ln 5 - ln 2 - t).

Hmm, this looks like a transcendental equation, which might not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. Maybe I can try to find a numerical solution, but before that, perhaps I can make some smart substitution or see if t can be expressed in terms of known constants.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach to the problem that avoids getting into such a complicated equation. Let me think again.

Another approach: from equation 1 and 2, I have x = 10k and y = 5/(2k), where k = log_y(x). Since k is log_y(x), which is the same as log_y(10k), perhaps I can write an equation in k and solve it.

Wait, let me try without substitution. So, from equation 1: x * log_x(y) = 10. Equation 2: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Let me write equation 1 as:

log_x(y^x) = 10 → y^x = x^10. Because if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c.

Similarly, equation 2
