Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon, ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which probably makes it a special kind of hexagon, maybe something like a regular hexagon but not necessarily. The key is that all sides are equal, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

The problem says that the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay, let me visualize this. In a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF should form a triangle. That triangle has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. So, I think this triangle is larger than the hexagon, and the hexagon is somehow inscribed within it or related through similar triangles.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, let's denote the side length as 's'. Now, because opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric figure. Wait, no, not necessarily, but in this case, maybe it's affine regular or something. But I'm not too sure about that. Maybe I should think in terms of similar triangles or coordinate geometry.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon. Since opposite sides are parallel, maybe I can set up vectors for the sides. Let me imagine the hexagon in a plane. Let me define vectors for each side. Since it's convex, all internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me denote the sides as vectors. Letâ€™s say AB is vector **a**, BC is vector **b**, CD is vector **c**, DE is vector **d**, EF is vector **e**, and FA is vector **f**. Since it's a hexagon, the sum of these vectors should be zero: **a** + **b** + **c** + **d** + **e** + **f** = 0.

But since it's equilateral, all the vectors have the same magnitude, but their directions can vary. Also, opposite sides are parallel, meaning **a** is parallel to **d**, **b** is parallel to **e**, and **c** is parallel to **f**. So, this implies that **d** = k**a**, **e** = m**b**, **f** = n**c**, where k, m, n are scalars. But since it's a closed hexagon, the sum is zero.

Wait, but opposite sides are not only parallel but also in an equilateral hexagon, they might not necessarily be equal in length, but since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides are same length. So, if AB and DE are opposite and both have length s, then DE is equal in length and parallel to AB. So, **d** = **a** if they are equal and parallel, but that depends on the direction.

Wait, no. Because vectors have direction, so if AB is vector **a**, DE is the same as AB but in the opposite direction? Or same direction? Wait, in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal, maybe vectors **a** and **d** are equal because opposite sides are both length s and parallel. So, **d** = **a**, **e** = **b**, **f** = **c**? Hmm, but that might make the hexagon a regular hexagon, which is a special case. But the given triangle has sides of different lengths, so it's not regular.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the vectors can be in the same direction but scaled. But since the sides are all length s, the vectors can't be scaled; they have the same magnitude. So, **a**, **b**, **c**, **d**, **e**, **f** all have magnitude s, but directions can vary. Also, since opposite sides are parallel, **a** is parallel to **
