Okay, so I have this problem where Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the total time taken, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk will take if she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand the details. 

First scenario: She walks at a constant speed of s km/h, and the total time, including t minutes in the coffee shop, is 4 hours. Wait, 4 hours is 240 minutes. So the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop equals 240 minutes.

Second scenario: She walks at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes. Again, walking time plus coffee time equals 144 minutes.

I need to find the time it takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes. So, I think I can set up some equations to solve for s and t first, and then compute the time for the new speed.

Let me write down the equations.

In the first scenario:
Walking speed = s km/h
Distance = 9 km
Time walking = distance / speed = 9 / s hours
Total time including coffee = 4 hours = walking time + t (in hours)
Wait, but t is given in minutes. So I need to convert t into hours to keep the units consistent or convert everything into minutes. Maybe minutes would be better since the answer is required in minutes.

Wait, let's see. 1 hour = 60 minutes.

So in the first scenario:
Total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes.
Time walking = 9 km / s km/h = 9/s hours. To convert to minutes, 9/s * 60 minutes.
So, walking time in minutes = (9/s) * 60
Then, total time in minutes = walking time + t = 240
So equation 1: (9/s)*60 + t = 240

Similarly, in the second scenario:
Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
Time walking = 9 / (s+2)
