Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 sides, right? And each side or diagonal can be part of the sides of a rectangle. Hmm, I need to figure out how many such rectangles exist.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, if I remember correctly. But maybe that's not directly relevant here. 

The problem mentions that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle aren't necessarily the sides of the dodecagon; they could also be diagonals.

I think the key here is to figure out how to choose four vertices of the dodecagon such that the quadrilateral they form is a rectangle. Because a rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides equal and all angles right angles. In a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals have specific lengths and angles, so perhaps we can use that.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the diagonals can be of different lengths, right? Depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a regular polygon, the length of a diagonal depends on the number of sides it skips. So, for a dodecagon, the diagonals can have lengths based on how many edges apart the two vertices are.

So, to form a rectangle inside the dodecagon, I need to choose four points such that the sides are either sides or diagonals, and the figure has four right angles. Hmm, but how do the diagonals and sides relate to form right angles?

Maybe I should think in terms of vectors. For a rectangle, the sides must be perpendicular. So, if I can find two vectors (sides or diagonals) that are perpendicular and have the same length, and then see if the opposite sides are also present.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to recognize that in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides and pairs of parallel diagonals that are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the
