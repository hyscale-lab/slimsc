Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths have to be of length 16, which makes sense because moving from the lower left to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid requires 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The condition is that the path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, that's interesting. I need to figure out how to count these paths.

First, let me make sure I understand what it means to change direction. In a grid, a path can either move right or up. So, each step is either right (R) or up (U). When the path changes direction, it switches from R to U or U to R. So, every time the direction changes, it's like the path switches from moving horizontally to vertically or vice versa.

For example, a path that goes all the way right first and then all the way up has only one direction change. Similarly, a path that alternates between right and up every step would change direction every time, which would be 15 changes for 16 steps. But we want paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, actually, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the path switches from R to U or U to R. So, if a path has k direction changes, how does that relate to the number of runs? A run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, each time the direction changes, a new run starts.

For example, a path that goes R, R, U, U, R, R, U, U has three direction changes, resulting in four runs: two Rs, then two Us, then two Rs, then two Us.

So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. Therefore, if a path changes direction exactly four times, it must have five runs. Because each direction change adds a new run. So, starting with the first run, each change adds another run, so four changes give five runs.

Now, since the path starts at the lower left corner and ends at the upper right corner, the first step can be either right or up. So, there are two cases: starting with R or starting with U.

Let me consider the case where the path starts with a right move. Then, the runs alternate between R and U. Since the total number of runs is five, which is odd, the path will start with R and end with a run of R or U? Wait, starting with R, and having five runs, the directions of the runs will be R, U, R, U, R. Because each run alternates. So, five runs mean the path starts with R, then U, then R, and so on, ending with R as the fifth run.

Similarly, if the path starts with U, the runs will be U, R, U, R, U. So, five runs in total, starting with U and ending with U.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, the total number of right moves must equal 8, and the total number of up moves must equal 8. So, for each case (starting with R or starting with U), we need to distribute these 8 R's and 8 U's into the five runs, with the constraint that each run has at least one step.

Because each run must have at least one step; you can't have a run of zero steps.

So, for the starting with R case, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, there are three R runs and two U runs. The total R steps are 8, so these three runs must add up to 8. Similarly, the two U runs must add up to 8. Each run has at least one step.

Similarly, for the starting with U case, there are three U runs and two R runs, each run having at least one step, and the total R steps are 8, U steps are 8.

So, in both cases, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to distribute 8 steps into a certain number of runs with each run having at least one step.

This is a stars and bars problem. The number of ways to distribute n indistinct items into k distinct boxes with each box having at least one item is C(n-1, k-1).

So, for the starting with R case: we have three R runs and two U runs.

For the R runs: distributing 8 steps into 3 runs. The number of ways is C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, for the U runs: distributing 8 steps into 2 runs. The number of ways is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7.

So, the total number of paths starting with R is 21 *7 = 147.

Similarly, for the starting with U case: we have three U runs and two R runs.

For the U runs: distributing 8 steps into 3 runs: C(7,2)=21.

For the R runs: distributing 8 steps into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, the total number is also 21 *7=147.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 +147=294.

Wait a second, that seems straightforward, but let me confirm I didn't miss anything.

Wait, but the problem says "change direction exactly four times." So, the number of direction changes is four. As I thought before, the number of runs is five. So, each case (starting with R or U) contributes 147, totaling 294.

But let me think again: is there any restriction on the direction changes? For example, can the path have runs that are zero length? No, because each run must have at least one step. So, the stars and bars approach is correct because each run has at least one step.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the number of times we switch from R to U or U to R, let me think about the structure.

Another approach might be to model the path as a sequence of moves, where each move is either R or U. The path has 16 steps, of which 8 are R and 8 are U.

The number of direction changes is equal to the number of times consecutive steps are different. So, a path that alternates R and U every step would have 15 direction changes. But we need exactly four.

So, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of binary sequences of length 16 with exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, and exactly four direction changes.

Each direction change corresponds to a switch from R to U or U to R. So, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of ways to arrange the R's and U's so that there are exactly four direction changes.

This can be approached by considering the number of runs. Each direction change corresponds to the start of a new run. So, four direction changes mean five runs.

So, for each case (starting with R or starting with U), we calculate the number of ways to distribute the R's and U's into the runs.

As previously, for starting with R, we have three R runs and two U runs (five runs in total). Each run has at least one step.

For R runs: 8 R's divided into 3 runs: C(7,2)=21.

For U runs: 8 U's divided into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7.

Multiply them: 21*7=147.

Same for starting with U: 21*7=147.

Total: 294.

So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.

Alternatively, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using recursion or dynamic programming? But since it's a small grid, but the problem is more combinatorial.

Wait, but let me think about the number of direction changes. Each time the direction changes, it's a new run. So, for exactly four direction changes, we have five runs.

Each run must be of length at least one step.

So, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of ways to partition the 8 R's into the appropriate number of runs and the 8 U's into the appropriate number of runs.

In the starting with R case, the runs alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.

Number of ways: (number of ways to split 8 R's into 3 runs) * (number of ways to split 8 U's into 2 runs).

Which is C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147.

Similarly for starting with U, it's the same.

So, total 294.

Hence, the answer is 294.

Wait, but to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me check another way.

Suppose I think about the number of direction changes and the number of runs.

Each direction change is a switch, so four changes mean five runs.

Each run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction.

So, for each starting direction, the runs are R, U, R, U, R or U, R, U, R, U.

In both cases, the number of runs for each direction is three and two, but it depends on the starting direction.

Wait, no: if the path starts with R, and has five runs, the runs alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.

Similarly, starting with U, it's U, R, U, R, U: three U runs and two R runs.

So, in both cases, the number of runs for each direction is three and two.

So, the number of ways is the same for both starting directions: (ways to partition R's into 3) * (ways to partition U's into 2) and vice versa.

So, each case contributes 147, totaling 294.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

The number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (n,n) with exactly k direction changes is 2 * C(n-1, a) * C(n-1, b), where a + b = number of runs, depending on starting direction.

Wait, but I think the key is that each starting direction leads to a different distribution of runs, but the calculation is symmetric.

So, I think my initial calculation is correct.

Therefore, the number of such paths is 294.


To solve the problem, we consider paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 16 steps, with 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) moves. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R.

A path changing direction exactly four times has five runs (consecutive sequences of the same direction). These runs alternate between R and U. There are two cases: starting with R or starting with U.

1. **Starting with R**: The runs are R, U, R, U, R. This means three R runs and two U runs.
   - Distributing 8 R's into 3 runs: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.
   - Distributing 8 U's into 2 runs: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.
   - Total paths starting with R: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

2. **Starting with U**: The runs are U, R, U, R, U. This means three U runs and two R runs.
   - Distributing 8 U's into 3 runs: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.
   - Distributing 8 R's into 2 runs: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.
   - Total paths starting with U: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

Adding both cases, the total number of paths is \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

**Answer:** \boxed{294}
