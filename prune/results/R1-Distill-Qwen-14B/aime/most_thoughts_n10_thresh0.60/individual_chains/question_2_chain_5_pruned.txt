Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the solution step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then there's a family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. For each segment PQ, P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. So, PQ is a line segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, with length 1, and both P and Q are in the first quadrant.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then, we need to find p + q.

Alright, so first, let me visualize this. We have point O at the origin, A at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). Then B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is about (0, 0.866), so a bit less than three-quarters up the y-axis.

The segment AB connects A and B. Let me find the equation of line AB. Since it goes from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me check that. When x = 0, y should be sqrt(3)/2, which matches. When x = 1/2, y = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2) = 0, which also matches. So that's correct.

Now, the family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant. So each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1.

Wait, the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. So for each such segment PQ, the points P and Q lie on the x and y axes respectively, and satisfy p² + q² = 1.

So, the family F is the set of all such segments PQ where P is (p,0), Q is (0,q), and p² + q² = 1.

So, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p and q positive, and p² + q² =1.

Now, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, point C is on AB and is only intersected by AB from the family F, and no other PQ from F.

Our goal is to find OC².

Hmm, so I think the approach is to find the envelope of all these segments PQ, and then find where AB intersects this envelope, which would be point C.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, for each PQ in F, the envelope would be the curve that just touches each PQ at a single point.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is the set of points where each point lies on exactly one PQ in F. So, if point C is on AB and not on any other PQ in F, it must lie on the envelope of F and on AB.

Wait, but the problem says that C is on AB, and not on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, perhaps AB is one of the PQ segments, so point C is the intersection of AB with the envelope of F, meaning that beyond that point, the envelope curves away, and beyond that, other PQs don't intersect AB again.

Alternatively
