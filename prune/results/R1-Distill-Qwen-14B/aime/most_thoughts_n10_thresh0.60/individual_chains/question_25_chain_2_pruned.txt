Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. 

There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given for everyone. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. 

The numbers are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Wait, and all own candy hearts. So these are four categories, with candy hearts being universal.

Now, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four. 

Hmm, this sounds like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by considering their individual sizes and the sizes of their intersections.

But wait, let me think. Each resident owns at least the candy hearts, so the total number of residents is 900. The other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are optional. 

Let me denote:
- D = set of residents owning a diamond ring
- G = set of residents owning golf clubs
- S = set of residents owning a garden spade
- C = set of residents owning candy hearts (which is everyone)

So, |C| = 900, and |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.

We also know that 437 own exactly two of the four items, but wait, actually, each resident owns a candy heart, so when they say "exactly two," does that include the candy hearts or not? Hmm, the problem says "exactly two of these things," referring to the four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So yes, the exact counts include the possibility of owning two, considering the candy hearts as one of the four.

But wait, hold on. Let me re-read the problem: "there are 437 residents who own exactly
