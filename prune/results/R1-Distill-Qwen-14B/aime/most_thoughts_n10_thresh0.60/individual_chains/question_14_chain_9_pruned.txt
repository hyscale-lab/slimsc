Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

We need to find the greatest four-digit positive integer, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when we divide N by 1000, we get Q as the quotient and R as the remainder. Finally, we need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number. Let's denote it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. Since it's a four-digit number, A can't be zero. So A is from 1 to 9, and B, C, D are from 0 to 9.

The key property here is that if any one digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1, or B to 1, or C to 1, or D to 1, each time gives a number that's divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N. So, we need to maximize N, which means we should try to maximize A first, then B, then C, then D.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since changing each digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, each of these modified numbers must satisfy the divisibility rule for 7.

I know that divisibility by 7 can be checked by various methods, but for programming purposes, perhaps we can model each condition as a congruence modulo 7.

So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 must make the number divisible by 7. Let me model each condition.

Let me denote N as 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

Case 1: Changing A to 1. The new number is 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Let's call this N1. So, N1 must be divisible by 7.

Similarly,

Case 2: Changing B to 1. The new number is 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D. Let's call this N2.

Case 3: Changing C to 1. The new number is 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D. Let's call this N3.

Case 4: Changing D to 1. The new number is 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, we can write congruence relations for each case.

Let me express each case:

1. N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

But N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) + (1 - A)*1000.

Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since N1 is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D, we can write N1 = N - (1000A) + 1000. Therefore, N1 = N + 1000*(1 - A). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me compute N1 mod 7.

Since 1000 ≡ x mod7, 100 ≡ y mod7, 10 ≡ z mod7, and 1 ≡ 1 mod7.

First, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7.

Compute 1000 mod7:

7*142 = 994, 1000 - 994 = 6 ⇒ 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, for N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Compute N1 mod7:

6 + (2)*B + (3)*C + D ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N mod7 is (6A + 2B + 3C + D) mod7.

But N1 is when A is changed to 1, so N1 mod7 is (6*1 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, for N2, which is when B is changed to 1:

N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D.

N2 mod7 is (6A + 2*1 + 3C + D) ≡0 mod7.

For N3, changing C to 1:

N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D.

N3 mod7 is (6A + 2B + 3*1 + D) ≡0 mod7.

For N4, changing D to 1:

N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C +1.

N4 mod7 is (6A + 2B + 3C +1) ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four congruence equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (from N1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (from N2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7. (from N3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7. (from N4)

So, we have four equations with variables A, B, C, D, all digits (A: 1-9, others: 0-9). Our goal is to find the largest N, so we should maximize A first, then B, then C, then D.

So, perhaps we can solve these equations step by step.

Let me write down the four equations:

Equation 1: 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 ≡1 mod7.

Equation 2:6A +3C + D ≡ -2 ≡5 mod7.

Equation 3:6A +2B + D ≡ -3 ≡4 mod7.

Equation4:6A +2B +3C ≡ -1 ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, so four equations:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 (mod7).  -- (1)

2.6A +3C + D ≡5 (mod7).    -- (2)

3.6A +2B + D ≡4 (mod7).    -- (3)

4.6A +2B +3C ≡6 (mod7).    -- (4)

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Looking at equations (1) and (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) ≡5 -1 ⇒6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Simplify:

6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as:

(6A - 2B) ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, perhaps take equation (3):

6A +2B + D ≡4.

We can consider equation (3) - equation (2):

(6A +2B + D) - (6A +3C + D) ≡4 -5 ⇒ -3C ≡-1 ⇒3C≡1 mod7.

So, 3C ≡1 mod7.

We can solve for C.

Multiplicative inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, C ≡5*1≡5 mod7.

But C is a digit (0-9), so possible values are C=5 or C=12, but 12 is invalid. So C=5.

So, C=5.

Great, so we have C=5.

Now, let's plug C=5 into equation (1):

Equation (1): 2B +3*5 + D ≡1 ⇒2B +15 + D ≡1 mod7.

Compute 15 mod7: 15/7=2*7=14, so 15≡1 mod7.

So, 2B +1 + D ≡1 ⇒2B + D ≡0 mod7.

So, 2B + D ≡0 mod7. -- Let's call this equation (1a).

Similarly, equation (2): 6A +3*5 + D ≡5 ⇒6A +15 + D ≡5 mod7.

15 mod7 is 1, so 6A +1 + D ≡5 ⇒6A + D ≡4 mod7. -- (2a)

Equation (3):6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7. -- (3)

Equation (4):6A +2B +3*5 ≡6 ⇒6A +2B +15 ≡6 mod7.

15 mod7=1, so 6A +2B +1 ≡6 ⇒6A +2B ≡5 mod7. -- (4a)

So, now our equations are:

(1a): 2B + D ≡0 mod7.

(2a):6A + D ≡4 mod7.

(3):6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

(4a):6A +2B ≡5 mod7.

Hmm, let's see. Let me write down (1a) and (2a):

From (1a): D ≡ -2B mod7.

From (2a):6A + D ≡4 ⇒ D ≡4 -6A mod7.

So, equate the two expressions for D:

-2B ≡4 -6A mod7.

Rewrite: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Which is the same as equation (2)-(1), which we had earlier.

Hmm.

Also, equation (3):6A +2B + D ≡4.

But from equation (1a), D ≡-2B. So, substitute into equation (3):

6A +2B + (-2B) ≡4 ⇒6A ≡4 mod7.

So, 6A ≡4 mod7.

We can solve for A.

Multiplying both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, the inverse exists.

6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse of 6 mod7 is 6.

Thus, A ≡4*6 ≡24 ≡3 mod7.

So, A ≡3 mod7.

Since A is a digit from 1-9, possible A values are 3, 10, 17,... but since A is a digit, only 3 and 10 would be possible, but 10 is invalid. Wait, 3, 10 is beyond 9, so only A=3 and A=3+7=10, but 10 is invalid. So, A=3.

Wait, wait, 3 mod7 is 3. So, possible A values are 3, 10, 17, etc., but since A is a single digit (1-9), the possible A is 3 only.

Wait, wait, 3+7=10 is invalid, so A=3 is the only possibility.

Wait, but 3 is okay because 3 is between 1
