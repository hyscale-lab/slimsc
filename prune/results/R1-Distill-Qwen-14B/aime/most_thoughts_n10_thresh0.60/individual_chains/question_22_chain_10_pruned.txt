Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

First, let me visualize what's going on. A convex equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length, and all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, opposite sides are parallel, so that gives some symmetry to the shape. Now, when they say that the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300, that must mean that these sides, when extended, form a triangle. I think this triangle is outside the hexagon, acting as a larger triangle that encapsulates the hexagon somehow.

Wait, so if I have a hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it must be similar to a triangle when extended. That makes sense because each pair of opposite sides is parallel, so the extensions will meet at some point, forming a triangle. So, the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle, touching each side once.

I remember that in such cases, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by cutting off smaller triangles from the corners of the larger triangle. These smaller triangles are similar to the larger triangle because all sides are proportional.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each of its sides must be equal, say of length 's'. Now, the larger triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me note that down: Triangle sides are 200, 240, 300.

I need to find 's'. Let me think about how the hexagon relates to this triangle. Each side of the triangle is divided into three segments by the hexagon. The segments closer to the vertices are the ones that are cut off by the hexagon, and the middle segments are the sides of the hexagon.

Wait, but the hexagon has six sides, each of length 's'. So, each side of the larger triangle is divided into two parts: one part is the side of the hexagon, which is 's', and the other part is the remaining length. But wait
