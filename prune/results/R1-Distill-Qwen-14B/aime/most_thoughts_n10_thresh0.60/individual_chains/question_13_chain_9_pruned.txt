Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's walks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop. There are two scenarios given about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Then, we need to find the time when she walks at a different speed, including the coffee shop time.

Let me parse the details:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at s+2 kilometers per hour, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Weâ€™re supposed to find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm. So, the key here is to find s and t first, I think. Because once we have those, we can compute the time for the new speed.

Let me start by writing down what I know.

First, the distance is always 9 km. So, the time she spends walking (without coffee) plus the coffee time equals the total time.

Let me denote the walking time as Tw, and the coffee time as Tc = t minutes. But wait, the problem gives the total time including t, so maybe I should write it as:

Total time = Time_walking + t.

But wait, the problem says that the total time includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the time spent walking is the total time minus t. But wait, no. Wait, the total time is the time from leaving home to returning, which includes both walking and the coffee stop. So, when she walks at speed s, her total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Similarly, when she walks faster, her total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, including t minutes.

So, the walking time is total time minus t.

But t is in minutes, while the walking times are given in hours. Maybe I should convert all units to hours or minutes to make it consistent.

Let me convert everything into hours. So, 4 hours is 4 hours, and 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. Wait, 24 minutes is 0.4 hours? No, wait, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2 hours 24 minutes is 2.4 hours.

Similarly, t is in minutes, so I can convert it to hours by dividing by 60. Let's denote t_h = t / 60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:

Walking speed = s km/h.

Time spent walking = (9 km) / (s km/h) = 9/s hours.

Total time = Time walking + t_h = 4 hours.

So, equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, second scenario:

Walking speed = (s + 2) km/h.

Time spent walking =
