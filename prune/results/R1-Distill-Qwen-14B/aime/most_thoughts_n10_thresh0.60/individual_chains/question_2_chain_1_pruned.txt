Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). They form the triangle OAB. Then there's this family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with length 1.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, not equal to A or B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. We need to find OC² and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Points O, A, B... So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway to (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit higher, since sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So triangle OAB is a right triangle? Wait, O is (0,0), A is (1/2,0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2, and AB... Let me compute AB's length.

Distance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is a unit length segment. So AB is part of the family F? Because each segment in F is of unit length, P on x-axis, Q on y-axis.

Wait, so AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So yes, that's a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, and the length is 1, so AB is indeed in F.

But the problem is about another point C on AB (distinct from A and B) that is not on any other segment in F. So we need to find such a point C on AB that no other PQ in F passes through it. Then compute OC².

So how do I approach this? Maybe parametrize AB and then find which point on AB doesn't lie on any other PQ in F.

Let me parameterize AB. Let me set a parameter t, where t=0 corresponds to point A (1/2, 0) and t=1 corresponds to point B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the parametric equations can be:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So for t from 0 to 1, we go from A to B.

So any point C on AB can be written as ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2) t )

We need to find t such that C is not on any other PQ in F except for AB.

But AB is a segment in F, so C is on AB. The other segments in F are from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, since each PQ has length 1. So p² + q² = 1. So for any (p, q) with p ≥ 0, q ≥ 0, p² + q² = 1.

So any PQ is the line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q). The equation of that line can be written as x/p + y/q = 1.

So if point C lies on another PQ, then its coordinates must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1 for some p and q with p² + q² = 1.

So for point C = ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2) t ), we have the equation:

[ (1 - t)/2 ] / p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ] / q = 1

But since p² + q² = 1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p²). So substituting q, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe we can relate p and q through p² + q² = 1.

Wait, but we can think of the condition that C lies on PQ as:

( (1 - t)/
