Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3. 

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of the sphere, meaning it's inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, it can rest on the outside, touching the sphere externally along another circle. These circles have radii r_i and r_o respectively. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm. I remember that when two surfaces are tangent, their tangent planes at the point of contact are the same. Since the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, every point on that circle is a point of tangency. 

Let me think about the geometry here. The torus is generated by a circle of radius 3, revolved around an axis that's 6 units away. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube) is 3. 

When the torus is inside the sphere, and they're tangent, the sphere must touch the outermost part of the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere touches the innermost part of the torus. Wait, no, actually, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's resting on the inside, so the sphere is larger. So, the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. 

Wait, maybe I should model this mathematically. Let's consider the torus and the sphere in 3D space. Let me define the sphere first. Let's have the sphere centered at the origin with radius 11. The equation of the sphere is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, the torus is centered at the origin as well, right? Because when you revolve a circle around an axis in its plane, the center of the torus is at the same point as the center of the sphere, I think. So, the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. The equation of the torus can be written in terms of two angles, θ and φ. But maybe it's easier to write it in Cartesian coordinates.

The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is:

sqrt(x² + y²) = R ± sqrt(z² + (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)^2) ± r

Wait, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, the equation can be written as:

(sqrt(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z² = r²

Yes, that's a better way. So, for our torus, R = 6 and r = 3. Therefore, the equation is:

(sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the points where they are tangent must satisfy both equations. So, the points lie on both the sphere and the torus, and the normals to both surfaces at those points are the same. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus tube. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, think about the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to points on the torus. 

Wait
