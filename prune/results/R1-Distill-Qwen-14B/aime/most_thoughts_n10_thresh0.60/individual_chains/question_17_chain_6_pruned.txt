Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q. Finally, I need to find p + q where p and q are coprime. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let's try breaking it down.

First, let's recap what's given. Each box is a rectangular prism, so it has length, width, and height, let's say x, y, z. The surface area is 54, and the volume is 23. I remember that the surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume is xyz. So, we have two equations:

1) 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
2) xyz = 23

We're supposed to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must be able to contain all such boxes, so the sphere's radius must be at least as big as the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to any corner of the box. Alternatively, the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box.

Wait, right! The space diagonal of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, to find r², I need to find x² + y² + z² for the box, then divide by 4. But wait, the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B." So, I think this means that the sphere must contain any box in B, so the sphere's size must be such that it can contain all possible boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.

Hmm, so I think we need to find the maximum value of the space diagonal (or equivalently, x² + y² + z²) among all boxes in B, and then take half of that as the radius. So, r² would be (max x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

I think this is an optimization problem with constraints. So, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or other methods to maximize x² + y² + z² under these constraints.

Alternatively, maybe I can express variables in terms of each other to reduce the number of variables.

Let me write down the given constraints again:

1) 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 => xy + yz + zx = 27
2) xyz = 23

And
