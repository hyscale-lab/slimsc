Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what’s being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Alright, so N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. My goal is to find the largest such N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, and then sum Q and R.

Let me start by understanding the property. For N, which is a four-digit number, say N = ABCD where A, B, C, D are its digits (A not zero), changing any single digit to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

So, for example, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. All these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, I should assume it's as large as possible, probably starting with 9999 and working downwards until I find a number that satisfies the condition. But that might take too long, so I need a smarter approach.

First, let me think about the structure of N. Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits (a ≠ 0).

Changing each digit to 1 gives four numbers:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, let's denote them as N1, N2, N3, N4.

So,

N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

I can write each of these congruences in terms of N and the changes made.

Alternatively, maybe I can subtract N from each of these to find a relation.

Wait, let me think differently. Let’s consider each modified number as N with one digit changed to 1. So, let me compute N1 - N, N2 - N, etc.

Wait, N1 is N with a changed to 1: So N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

But N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

So, N1 - N = (1000 + 100b +10c +d) - (1000a +100b +10c +d) = 1000(1 - a) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1000(1 - a)

Similarly, N2 - N = (1000a + 100 + 10c + d) - N = 1000a + 100 +10c +d - (1000a +100b +10c +d) = 100(1 - b)

Similarly, N3 - N = (1000a + 100b +10 + d) - N = 1000a + 100b +10 + d - (1000a +100b +10c +d) = 10(1 - c)

And N4 - N = (1000a +100b +10c +1) - N = 1000a +100b +10c +1 - (1000a +100b +10c +d) = 1 - d

So, N1 = N + 1000(1 - a)

N2 = N + 100(1 - b)

N3 = N + 10(1 - c)

N4 = N + (1 - d)

Each of these modified numbers is divisible by 7, so N1 ≡ 0 mod 7, N2 ≡ 0 mod 7, N3 ≡ 0 mod 7, N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which implies:

N + 1000(1 - a) ≡ 0 mod 7

N + 100(1 - b) ≡ 0 mod 7

N + 10(1 - c) ≡ 0 mod 7

N + (1 - d) ≡ 0 mod 7

So, from these, we can write that:

1000(1 - a) ≡ -N mod 7

100(1 - b) ≡ -N mod 7

10(1 - c) ≡ -N mod 7

(1 - d) ≡ -N mod 7

Let me compute each coefficient modulo 7.

First, 1000 mod 7: 1000 /7 is 142 *7=994, so 1000 -994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 divided by7 is14*7=98, so 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is3.

1 mod7 is1.

So, 1000 ≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, and 1≡1 mod7.

So substituting these into the congruences:

6*(1 - a) ≡ -N mod7

2*(1 - b) ≡ -N mod7

3*(1 - c) ≡ -N mod7

1*(1 - d) ≡ -N mod7

Let me denote -N mod7 as k, so 6*(1 - a) ≡k, 2*(1 - b)≡k, 3*(1 - c)≡k, 1*(1 -d)≡k mod7.

So, all four expressions are congruent to the same k mod7.

So, 6*(1 - a) ≡ 2*(1 - b) ≡ 3*(1 - c) ≡1*(1 - d) ≡k mod7.

So, this implies that:

6*(1 - a) ≡ 2*(1 - b) mod7

Similarly, 2*(1 - b) ≡3*(1 - c) mod7

And 3*(1 - c) ≡1*(1 -d) mod7.

So, let me write these as equations:

1. 6*(1 - a) ≡ 2*(1 - b) mod7

2. 2*(1 - b) ≡3*(1 - c) mod7

3. 3*(1 - c) ≡1*(1 -d) mod7

Let me simplify equation 1:

6*(1 - a) ≡ 2*(1 - b)

Divide both sides by 2: 3*(1 - a) ≡ (1 - b) mod7

So, 3*(1 - a) ≡1 -b mod7

Similarly, equation 2:

2*(1 - b) ≡3*(1 - c)

Equation3:

3*(1 - c) ≡1 -d mod7

So, let me write:

From equation1: 3*(1 - a) ≡1 -b mod7 → 3 -3a ≡1 -b → 3 -1 ≡3a - b mod7 → 2 ≡3a - b mod7 → 3a - b ≡2 mod7 → equation A.

From equation2: 2*(1 - b) ≡3*(1 - c) → 2 -2b ≡3 -3c → 2 -3 ≡2b -3c mod7 → -1 ≡2b -3c mod7 → 6 ≡2b -3c mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6) → equation B.

From equation3: 3*(1 - c) ≡1 -d →3 -3c ≡1 -d → 3 -1 ≡3c -d →2 ≡3c -d mod7 → equation C.

So, now I have three equations:

A: 3a - b ≡2 mod7

B: 2b -3c ≡6 mod7

C:3c -d ≡2 mod7

So, the idea is to express these in terms of a, b, c, d.

I can try to express each variable in terms of the next, starting from a.

Let me see:

From equation A: 3a -b ≡2 mod7 → So, b ≡3a -2 mod7.

Similarly, from equation B: 2b -3c ≡6 mod7. Substitute b from A:

2*(3a -2) -3c ≡6 mod7 →6a -4 -3c ≡6 mod7 →6a -3c ≡6 +4 mod7 →6a -3c ≡10 mod7 →10 mod7 is 3 →6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3: (since 3 and 7 are coprime), so 2a -c ≡1 mod7. So, c ≡2a -1 mod7.

From equation C:3c -d ≡2 mod7. Substitute c from above:

3*(2a -1) -d ≡2 mod7 →6a -3 -d ≡2 mod7 →6a -d ≡5 mod7 →d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So now, all variables b, c, d can be expressed in terms of a.

So,

b ≡3a -2 mod7,

c ≡2a -1 mod7,

d ≡6a -5 mod7.

But since a, b, c, d are digits (0-9 for b, c, d; 1-9 for a), we can find possible values of a that make b, c, d digits.

Since N is as large as possible, we should start with a=9 and work our way down.

So let's try a=9.

Compute b, c, d modulo7.

But wait, the congruences give b ≡3a -2 mod7, but a=9, which is 2 mod7 (since 9/7=1*7+2). So,

b ≡3*(2) -2 mod7 →6 -2=4 mod7 →b≡4 mod7.

So b could be 4 or 11, but since b is a digit (0-9), possible b=4 or 11, but 11 is invalid. So b=4.

Similarly, c ≡2a -1 mod7. a=9 is 2 mod7, so:

c ≡2*(2) -1=4 -1=3 mod7. So c=3 or 10, but c is a digit, so c=3 or 10, but 10 is invalid. So c=3.

d ≡6a -5 mod7. a=9 is 2 mod7, so 6*2=12, 12-5=7 →7 mod7=0. So d ≡0 mod7. So d=0 or7.

So, for a=9, possible b=4, c=3, d=0 or7.

So, N could be 9430 or 9437. Let's check if these satisfy the conditions.

First, check N=9437.

Compute N1: change a to 1: 1437.

Is 1437 divisible by7? Let's check:

7*205=1435, so 1437-1435=2. So 1437 is 2 mod7, which is not 0. So N=9437 doesn’t satisfy the condition.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the logic.

Wait, maybe I assumed that b=4, c=3, d=7, but when a=9, but the actual digits could be higher than the mod7 values because mod7 gives the remainder, but the actual digit could be in the same residue class but higher.

Wait, the issue is that when a=9, the expression for b is b ≡4 mod7, so b could be 4, 11, 18,... but since b is a digit, b=4 is the only possibility.

Similarly, c=3 mod7, so c=3 or 10, which is invalid, so c=3.

d ≡0 mod7, so d=0 or7.

So, for a=9, the maximum possible N would be 9437, but when I change a to1, I get 1437, which is not divisible by7. So that’s a problem.

Hmm, so perhaps N=9437 is invalid. So, maybe a=9 is not possible, so I need to try a=8.

Wait, but before that, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the expressions for b, c, d. Let me go back.

Wait, maybe the expressions are b ≡3a -2 mod7, so when a=9, 3*9=27, 27-2=25, 25 mod7 is 4, so b=4 mod7, correct.

Similarly, c=2a-1 mod7. a=9: 2*9=18, 18-1=17 mod7 is 3, so c=3 mod7.

d=6a-5 mod7: 6*9=54, 54-5=49, which is 0 mod7, so d=0 mod7, so d=0 or7.

So, N=9437: when I change a to1, the number becomes 1437. Let me check 1437 mod7.

Calculating 1437 ÷7: 7*200=1400, 1437-1400=37. 37 ÷7 is 5*7=35, remainder 2. So 1437 ≡2 mod7, which is not 0. So it's invalid.

Therefore, N=9437 is invalid. So, perhaps a=9 is not possible, so move to a=8.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the way I derived the congruences. Let me check that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that N itself is congruent to -k mod7, where k is from each of the expressions. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, another approach: Each modified number N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by7. So, each of them is 0 mod7.

But N is the original number, so N1 = N + 1000(1 - a), which is 0 mod7. So, N + 1000(1 - a) ≡0 mod7.

Similarly for the others.

So, N ≡ -1000(1 -a) mod7.

But 1000 mod7 is 6, as we found earlier. So N ≡ -6*(1 -a) mod7.

Similarly, N ≡ -2*(1 -b) mod7, and so on.

So, all four expressions are equal to N mod7.

Thus, N ≡ -6*(1 -a) ≡ -2*(1 -b) ≡ -3*(1 -c) ≡ -(1 -d) mod7.

So, let me write:

-6*(1 -a) ≡ -2*(1 -b) mod7

-2*(1 -b) ≡ -3*(1 -c) mod7

-3*(1 -c) ≡ -(1 -d) mod7

Simplify each congruence.

First congruence:

-6*(1 -a) ≡ -2*(1 -b) mod7

Divide both sides by -1: 6*(1 -a) ≡2*(1 -b) mod7.

As before, which leads to 3*(1 -a) ≡1 -b mod7, which is the same as equation A.

Similarly, the other congruences follow.

So, perhaps the earlier approach is correct, and the issue is that when a=9, although b=4, c=3, d=7, the modified number when a is changed to1 is 1437, which is not divisible by7. So N=9437 is invalid.

So, perhaps a=9 is not possible, so we need to try a=8.

So, let's try a=8.

Compute b, c, d.

b ≡3a -2 mod7. a=8 is 1 mod7 (since 8-7=1). So 3*1 -2=1 mod7. So b≡1 mod7.

So possible b=1 or8 (since b is a digit). To maximize N, we'd want the largest possible digits, so let's choose b=8.

Wait, but wait: if a=8, then b=1 mod7, so possible b digits are 1 and 8. So, to maximize N, we pick b=8.

Similarly, c≡2a -1 mod7. a=8 is 1 mod7. So 2*1 -1=1 mod7. So c≡1 mod7. So possible c=1 or8. Again, to maximize, pick c=8.

d≡6a -5 mod7. a=8 is1 mod7. So 6*1 -5=1 mod7. So d≡1 mod7. Possible d=1 or8. Again, pick d=8 to maximize.

So, with a=8, b=8, c=8, d=8, N=8888.

Wait, but let me check if this satisfies the condition.

Change any digit to1:

1. Changing a to1: 1888. Is 1888 divisible by7?

1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5, so remainder 5. Not divisible by7. So N=8888 is invalid.

So, a=8, b=8, c=8, d=8 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I can't have all digits as8. Maybe I need to choose lower digits.

Wait, but wait, the congruences only give the residues. So, for a=8, b≡1 mod7, so possible b=1,8. Since 8 is allowed, but when we pick b=8, it may not satisfy the condition when we change it to1.

Wait, but when we change b to1, the number becomes 8188. Let's check if that's divisible by7.

Compute 8188 ÷7:

7*1169=8183, 8188-8183=5, so remainder5. Not divisible by7. So N=8888 is invalid.

So, a=8 is not working. So, perhaps I need to pick the next lower a.

Wait, but maybe when a=8, choosing b=1 instead of8 would be better.

So, let me try a=8, b=1, c=8, d=8: N=8188.

Check if changing any digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

Wait, but N=8188.

Change a to1: 1188. 1188 ÷7: 7*169=1183, 1188-1183=5, so remainder5. Not divisible.

So that's no good either.

Hmm, so maybe a=8 is not possible. Let's try a=7.

a=7, which is 0 mod7.

Compute:

b ≡3a -2 mod7.

3*0 -2= -2 mod7=5. So b≡5 mod7.

Possible b=5 or12, but 12 is invalid. So b=5.

c≡2a -1 mod7. a=7 is0 mod7. So 2*0 -1= -1 mod7=6. So c≡6 mod7.

Possible c=6 or13, so c=6.

d≡6a -5 mod7. a=7 is0 mod7. So 6*0 -5= -5 mod7=2. So d≡2 mod7. So d=2 or9. To maximize, pick d=9.

So, N=7 5 6 9 →7569.

Check if changing any digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

Let's check each modified number:

1. Change a to1: 1569.

1569 ÷7: 7*224=1568, so 1569-1568=1 → remainder1. Not divisible.

So N=7569 is invalid.

Hmm, maybe a=7 is not possible. Next, try a=6.

a=6, which is6 mod7.

Compute:

b≡3a -2 mod7 →3*6=18, 18-2=16 mod7=2. So b≡2 mod7.

Possible b=2 or9.

c≡2a -1 mod7 →2*6=12, 12-1=11 mod7=4. So c≡4 mod7.

Possible c=4 or11, so c=4.

d≡6a -5 mod7 →6*6=36, 36-5=31 mod7=3 (since 31 ÷7 is4*7=28, 31-28=3). So d≡3 mod7. So d=3 or10, but 10 is invalid, so d=3.

To maximize N, choose the largest possible digits for b, c, d.

So, b=9 (since 9 is ≡2 mod7: 9-7=2), c=4, d=3.

So, N=6943.

Check the conditions:

Change a to1: 1943.

Check 1943 ÷7: 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4 → remainder4. Not divisible.

Hmm, so N=6943 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I should choose the next possible b. Since b≡2 mod7, the next lower b is2. Let's try b=2.

So, N=6243.

Check changing a to1: 1243.

1243 ÷7: 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4 → remainder4. Not divisible.

Hmm, not working. Maybe a=6 isn't possible. Let's try a=5.

a=5, which is5 mod7.

Compute:

b≡3*5 -2=15-2=13 mod7=6. So b≡6 mod7.

Possible b=6 or13, but 13 is invalid, so b=6.

c≡2*5 -1=10 -1=9 mod7=2. So c≡2 mod7.

Possible c=2 or9.

d≡6*5 -5=30-5=25 mod7=4. So d≡4 mod7.

Possible d=4 or11, but 11 invalid, so d=4.

To maximize N, pick b=6, c=9, d=4.

So, N=5 6 9 4 →5694.

Check each modified number:

1. Change a to1: 1694.

Check 1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. Exactly, so 1694 is divisible by7.

Good.

2. Change b to1: 5194.

Check 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Exactly, so divisible.

3. Change c to1: 5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Exactly, divisible.

4. Change d to1: 5691.

5691 ÷7: Let's compute 7*813=5691. Exactly, so divisible.

Wow, that works!

So N=5694 satisfies all conditions.

But wait, is there a larger N than 5694 that satisfies the condition?

Wait, because a=5, but maybe a=6 or a=7 could have higher N but with different digits that satisfy.

Wait, earlier when a=6, N=6943 didn't work, but perhaps another combination with a=6 could work.

Alternatively, maybe N=5694 is the maximum possible.

Wait, but I can't be sure yet. Let me check a=5 and see if there's a larger N.

Wait, with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, N=5694.

Is there a higher N with a=5?

Wait, let's see, if I can have higher digits in b, c, d.

Wait, with a=5, b=6 is the maximum since b≡6 mod7, next possible is13, which is invalid, so b=6.

c=9 is allowed since c≡2 mod7, and 9 is the maximum possible digit in that class.

d=4, which is the maximum possible digit for d≡4 mod7.

So, 5694 is the maximum for a=5.

Now, can I find a higher N with a=6, but perhaps a different set of digits that satisfy the conditions?

Wait, earlier when a=6, I tried N=6943, which didn't work because changing a to1 gave 1943, which wasn't divisible by7. But perhaps a=6 with different digits could work.

Let me try a=6 again, but perhaps with lower digits that satisfy the congruences, but might still result in a higher N.

Wait, but maybe I can't find a higher N than 5694 with a=6, since when a=6, the maximum possible digits would be higher, but they failed. So perhaps 5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let's try a=5, but perhaps with higher digits if possible.

Wait, no, because a=5 is smaller than a=6 or7, so N=5xxx is less than 6xxx.

So, perhaps 5694 is the maximum N.

Wait, but let me check a=4, just in case.

a=4, which is4 mod7.

Compute:

b≡3*4 -2=12-2=10 mod7=3. So b≡3 mod7.

Possible b=3 or10, but 10 is invalid, so b=3.

c≡2*4 -1=8-1=7 mod7=0. So c≡0 mod7. Possible c=0 or7.

d≡6*4 -5=24-5=19 mod7=5. So d≡5 mod7. Possible d=5 or12, but 12 invalid, so d=5.

To maximize N, pick b=3, c=7, d=5. So N=4 3 7 5 →4375.

Check the conditions:

Change a to1: 1375.

1375 ÷7: 7*196=1372, 1375-1372=3 → remainder3. Not divisible.

So N=4375 is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps a=4 is not possible. Let me try a=3.

a=3, which is3 mod7.

Compute:

b≡3*3 -2=9-2=7 mod7=0. So b≡0 mod7.

Possible b=0 or7.

c≡2*3 -1=6-1=5 mod7. So c≡5 mod7.

Possible c=5 or12, but 12 invalid, so c=5.

d≡6*3 -5=18-5=13 mod7=6. So d≡6 mod7. Possible d=6 or13, which is invalid, so d=6.

To maximize N, pick b=7, c=5, d=6. So N=3 7 5 6 →3756.

Check the conditions:

Change a to1: 1756.

1756 ÷7: 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6 → remainder6. Not divisible.

So N=3756 is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps a=3 is not possible. Let me try a=2.

a=2, which is2 mod7.

Compute:

b≡3*2 -2=6-2=4 mod7. So b≡4 mod7.

Possible b=4 or11, which is invalid, so b=4.

c≡2*2 -1=4-1=3 mod7. So c≡3 mod7.

Possible c=3 or10, which is invalid, so c=3.

d≡6*2 -5=12-5=7 mod7=0. So d≡0 mod7. Possible d=0 or7.

To maximize N, pick b=4, c=3, d=7. So N=2 4 3 7 →2437.

Check the conditions:

Change a to1: 1437.

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2 → remainder2. Not divisible.

So N=2437 is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps a=2 is not possible. Let's try a=1.

a=1, which is1 mod7.

Compute:

b≡3*1 -2=3-2=1 mod7. So b≡1 mod7.

Possible b=1 or8.

c≡2*1 -1=2-1=1 mod7. So c≡1 mod7.

Possible c=1 or8.

d≡6*1 -5=6-5=1 mod7. So d≡1 mod7.

Possible d=1 or8.

To maximize N, pick b=8, c=8, d=8. So N=1 8 8 8 →1888.

Check the conditions:

Change a to1: same as N, which is 1888, which we've already seen is not divisible by7.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing lower digits for b, c, d.

But since a=1, the maximum N is 1888, which isn't valid. So a=1 is not possible.

Wait, maybe I've missed a possible a=9, but with lower digits.

Wait, earlier when a=9, I got N=9437, which didn't work. But maybe a=9 with lower digits could work.

Wait, let's think again: For a=9, b=4, c=3, d=0 or7.

So N could be 9430 or9437.

Check N=9430.

Change a to1: 1430.

1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2 → remainder2. Not divisible.

N=9430 invalid.

N=9437, as before, gives 1437, which is remainder2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem isn't that a=9 is invalid, but that I need to look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Let me try to find N such that when any digit is changed to1, the number becomes divisible by7.

Wait, another approach: For N, when any digit is changed to1, the new number is divisible by7. So, N must satisfy four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡0 mod7

2. A1CD ≡0 mod7

3. AB1D ≡0 mod7

4. ABC1 ≡0 mod7

So, perhaps I can express each of these in terms of N.

But N is ABCD, which is 1000A + 100B +10C + D.

Let me denote N as:

N = 1000A + 100B +10C + D.

Then, N1 = 1000*1 + 100B +10C + D = 1000 + 100B +10C + D.

Similarly,

N2 = 1000A + 100*1 +10C + D = 1000A +100 +10C + D.

N3 = 1000A + 100B +10*1 + D = 1000A +100B +10 + D.

N4 = 1000A + 100B +10C +1.

Each of these must be ≡0 mod7.

So,

N1 - N = 1000 + 100B +10C + D - (1000A +100B +10C + D) = 1000(1 - A) → 1000(1 - A) ≡0 mod7.

But 1000 ≡6 mod7, so 6*(1 - A) ≡0 mod7 → 6*(1 - A) ≡0 mod7.

Since 6 and7 are coprime, this implies (1 - A) ≡0 mod7 → A≡1 mod7.

So, A must be ≡1 mod7. Since A is a digit (1-9), possible A=1 or8.

Because 1 mod7 is1, 8 mod7 is1 (since 8-7=1). So A can be1 or8.

Wait, this is a crucial point I might have missed earlier. So, A must be 1 or8.

So, the thousands digit A must be1 or8.

So, if A=8, then N is in 8000s, which is higher than 5000s, so likely the maximum N is with A=8.

So, let's test A=8.

So, A=8.

Now, from equation A earlier: 3a -b ≡2 mod7. Since a=8, which is1 mod7, 3*1=3, so 3 -b ≡2 mod7 → -b ≡-1 mod7 → b≡1 mod7.

So, b can be1 or8.

But to maximize N, we want the largest possible b, so b=8.

Similarly, from equation B: 2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

With b=8, which is1 mod7, so 2*1=2. So 2 -3c ≡6 mod7 → -3c ≡4 mod7 → 3c ≡-4 mod7 →3c≡3 mod7 (since -4 mod7 is3). So, 3c≡3 mod7 → c≡1 mod7.

Thus, c can be1 or8.

To maximize N, pick c=8.

From equation C:3c -d ≡2 mod7.

With c=8, which is1 mod7: 3*1=3. So 3 -d ≡2 mod7 → -d ≡-1 mod7 →d≡1 mod7.

So d can be1 or8.

To maximize N, pick d=8.

So, N=8 8 8 8 →8888.

But earlier, when I checked N=8888, changing a to1 gives1888, which is not divisible by7. So, N=8888 is invalid.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps A=8 is possible, but with lower digits.

Wait, perhaps I need to pick lower b, c, d to satisfy the condition.

Since with a=8, b≡1 mod7, possible b=1 or8.

Let me try b=1.

Then, from equation B:2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

b=1, so 2*1=2. 2 -3c ≡6 →-3c≡4 →3c≡-4 mod7 →3c≡3 mod7 →c≡1 mod7.

So c=1 or8. To maximize N, pick c=8.

From equation C:3c -d ≡2 mod7.

c=8→3*1=3. 3 -d ≡2 →-d≡-1→d≡1 mod7. So d=1 or8. Pick d=8.

So, N=8 1 8 8 →8188.

Check if this works.

Change a to1:1188.

1188 ÷7: 7*169=1183. 1188-1183=5. Remainder5 → Not divisible.

Hmm, invalid.

So, a=8, b=1, c=8, d=8 is invalid.

Wait, maybe I need to pick c=1 instead.

So, with a=8, b=1, c=1, then from equation C:3c -d≡2 mod7.

3*1=3 →3 -d ≡2 →-d ≡-1 →d≡1 mod7.

So d=1 or8. Let's pick d=8 for maximum N.

So, N=8 1 1 8 →8118.

Check changing a to1:1118.

1118 ÷7: 7*159=1113, 1118-1113=5 → remainder5. Not divisible.

Hmm, not good.

Wait, maybe I need to pick c=1 and d=1.

N=8111.

Change a to1:1111.

1111 ÷7: 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5 → remainder5. Not divisible.

Nope.

Hmm, perhaps a=8 is not possible. So, I have to consider A=1.

Wait, but A=1 would make N a four-digit number starting with1, which is less than 5694, which I found earlier. But maybe 5694 isn't the maximum.

Wait, earlier with a=5, I found N=5694, which worked. So, perhaps 5694 is the maximum.

But let me check again.

Wait, since A must be1 or8, perhaps a=8 is possible but with different digits.

Wait, let me try a=8, b=8, c=8, d=1.

N=8881.

Check changing a to1:1881.

1881 ÷7: 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5. Remainder5. Not divisible.

So, no good.

Wait, perhaps a=8, b=8, c=1, d=8.

N=8818.

Change a to1:1818.

1818 ÷7: 7*259=1813, 1818-1813=5. Remainder5. Not good.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe a=8, b=1, c=1, d=1: N=8111.

Change a to1:1111, which we saw earlier gives remainder5.

Nope.

Wait, perhaps a=8, b=8, c=8, d=8 is invalid, but maybe a=8, b=8, c=8, d=0.

N=8880.

Change a to1:1880.

1880 ÷7: 7*268=1876, 1880-1876=4 → remainder4. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a=8, b=8, c=8, d=7.

N=8887.

Change a to1:1887.

1887 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1887-1883=4 → remainder4. Not divisible.

Hmm.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe a=8 is not possible, and the maximum N is 5694 with a=5.

Wait, but let me check a=5, N=5694.

Changing any digit to1:

1. Change a to1:1694 → divisible by7 (7*242=1694).

2. Change b to1:5194 → 7*742=5194.

3. Change c to1:5614 →7*802=5614.

4. Change d to1:5691 →7*813=5691.

All are divisible by7. So N=5694 works.

Is there a higher N than5694 with a=5? Let's see.

a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. That's 5694.

If I can find a higher N with a=5, that would be better.

Wait, perhaps with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is 5694.

Is there a higher N with a=5, but with higher digits in other places?

Wait, perhaps b could be higher but still satisfy the congruence.

Wait, from earlier, with a=5, b≡6 mod7. So possible b=6 or13 (invalid). So maximum b=6.

Similarly, c≡2 mod7, so c=2 or9. So maximum c=9.

d≡4 mod7, so d=4 or11 (invalid). So maximum d=4.

So, 5694 is the maximum for a=5.

So, perhaps 5694 is the maximum possible N.

Then, Q is the quotient when N is divided by1000, which is 5, since 5*1000=5000, and R is the remainder, which is 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q + R =5 +694=699.

Wait, but earlier I thought N=5694, but when I tried a=5, I got N=5694, which works. But wait, when a=5, N=5694, which is less than 8000, but perhaps I can find a higher N with a=8.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that a=8 is not possible. Let me try again.

Wait, when a=8, from the earlier congruences:

From equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7 →3*8=24 mod7=3 →3 -b ≡2 →b≡1 mod7.

So, b=1 or8. Let's pick b=8 to maximize.

Then, from equation B:2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

With b=8, which is1 mod7, 2*1=2 →2 -3c ≡6 →-3c ≡4 →3c ≡-4 mod7 →3c≡3 mod7 →c≡1 mod7.

So c=1 or8. Let's pick c=8.

From equation C:3c -d ≡2 mod7.

c=8→3*1=3 →3 -d ≡2 →d≡1 mod7. So d=1 or8. Let's pick d=8.

So N=8 8 8 8 →8888.

But as before, changing a to1:1888, which is not divisible by7.

Wait, perhaps if I pick lower digits for b, c, d, but still satisfy the congruences, could N be higher than5694?

Wait, for a=8, if I set b=1, c=1, d=1, then N=8111.

Check changing a to1:1111. 1111 ÷7=158.714… remainder5. Not good.

Alternatively, a=8, b=1, c=8, d=8: N=8188.

Change a to1:1188. 1188 ÷7=169.714… remainder5. Not good.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a=8, b=1, c=1, d=1:8111, but as before, doesn't work.

Alternatively, a=8, b=1, c=8, d=1:8181.

Change a to1:1181. 1181 ÷7=168.714… 7*168=1176, remainder5. Not good.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe a=8, b=1, c=8, d=8:8188, which we saw doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps a=8, b=1, c=8, d=0:8180.

Change a to1:1180. 1180 ÷7=168.571… 7*168=1176, 1180-1176=4 → remainder4. Not good.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a=8, b=1, c=8, d=7:8187.

Change a to1:1187. 1187 ÷7=169.571… 7*169=1183, 1187-1183=4 → remainder4. Not good.

This is getting me nowhere. Maybe a=8 is impossible, and the maximum N is5694.

Wait, but let me check another possibility: a=8, b=8, c=8, d=0.

N=8880.

Change a to1:1880.

1880 ÷7=268.571… 7*268=1876, 1880-1876=4 → remainder4. Not good.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the congruences.

Wait, earlier, I assumed that N must have A=1 or8 because 1000(1 -A) must be divisible by7, but perhaps that's not the case. Let me double-check that.

Wait, from N1 = N +1000(1 - A) ≡0 mod7.

So, N +1000(1 - A) ≡0 mod7.

Which implies N ≡-1000(1 - A) mod7.

Since 1000≡6 mod7, this is N ≡-6(1 - A) mod7.

Which is N ≡6(A -1) mod7.

Similarly, from N2 = N +100(1 - B) ≡0 mod7 → N ≡-100(1 - B) mod7.

Since 100≡2 mod7, N ≡-2(1 - B) mod7.

Similarly, from N3: N ≡-3(1 - C) mod7.

From N4: N ≡-(1 - D) mod7.

So, all these must be equal to each other:

6(A -1) ≡ -2(1 - B) ≡ -3(1 - C) ≡ -(1 - D) mod7.

Let me see if I can find a relation between A and B, etc.

From 6(A -1) ≡ -2(1 - B) mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7, which is4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So,

6(A -1)*4 ≡ -2(1 - B)*4 mod7.

Which is 24(A -1) ≡ -8(1 - B) mod7.

24 mod7 is3, -8 mod7 is-1≡6.

So:

3(A -1) ≡6(1 - B) mod7.

Divide both sides by3 (since 3 and7 are coprime):

A -1 ≡2(1 - B) mod7.

Which is:

A -1 ≡2 -2B mod7 → A +2B ≡3 mod7.

Similarly, from another congruence:

-2(1 - B) ≡ -3(1 - C) mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod7, which is4:

-2(1 - B)*4 ≡ -3(1 - C)*4 mod7.

-8(1 - B) ≡-12(1 - C) mod7.

-8 mod7= -1=6, -12 mod7= -5=2.

So:

6(1 - B) ≡2(1 - C) mod7.

Divide both sides by2:

3(1 - B) ≡ (1 - C) mod7.

Which is:

3 -3B ≡1 -C mod7 → -3B +C ≡-2 mod7 →3B -C ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, from another congruence:

-3(1 - C) ≡ -(1 - D) mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of3 mod7, which is5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

-3(1 - C)*5 ≡ -(1 - D)*5 mod7.

-15(1 - C) ≡-5(1 - D) mod7.

-15 mod7= -1, -5 mod7=2.

So:

-1(1 - C) ≡2(1 - D) mod7 → -1 +C ≡2 -2D mod7 →C +2D ≡3 mod7.

So, now I have three equations:

1. A + 2B ≡3 mod7

2. 3B -C ≡2 mod7

3. C + 2D ≡3 mod7

And from earlier:

6(A -1) ≡ -2(1 - B) mod7 → which led to equation1.

Let me try to solve these equations step by step.

From equation1: A ≡3 -2B mod7.

From equation2: C ≡3B -2 mod7.

From equation3: D ≡(3 - C)/2 mod7.

But division by2 is multiplication by4 mod7, since 2*4=8≡1.

So,

D ≡(3 - C)*4 mod7.

Substituting C from equation2:

C=3B -2.

So,

D ≡(3 - (3B -2))*4 mod7 →(3 -3B +2)*4 mod7 →(5 -3B)*4 mod7.

Compute 5*4=20≡6 mod7, (-3B)*4= -12B≡-5B mod7.

So,

D ≡6 -5B mod7.

So, D=6 -5B mod7.

Now, express A, C, D in terms of B.

So:

A ≡3 -2B mod7,

C ≡3B -2 mod7,

D ≡6 -5B mod7.

Now, since A, B, C, D are digits (A:1-9, B,C,D:0-9), let's find possible B values that make A, C, D valid digits.

Let me try B=0:

B=0,

A=3 -0=3 mod7 →A=3 or10 (invalid). So A=3.

C=0 -2= -2 mod7=5. So C=5 or12 (invalid). So C=5.

D=6 -0=6 mod7. So D=6 or13 (invalid). So D=6.

So N=3 0 5 6 →3056.

Check if changing any digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

1. Change a to1:1056.

1056 ÷7=150.857… 7*150=1050, 1056-1050=6 → remainder6. Not good.

So N=3056 invalid.

Next, B=1.

B=1,

A=3 -2*1=1 mod7 →A=1 or8.

C=3*1 -2=1 mod7 →C=1 or8.

D=6 -5*1=1 mod7 →D=1 or8.

To maximize N, pick A=8, C=8, D=8.

So N=8 1 8 8 →8188.

Check changing a to1:1188.

1188 ÷7=169.714… 7*169=1183, 1188-1183=5 → remainder5. Not good.

So invalid.

Next, B=2.

B=2,

A=3 -4= -1 mod7=6.

C=6 -2=4 mod7.

D=6 -10= -4 mod7=3.

So A=6, C=4, D=3.

To maximize N, set A=6, B=2, C=4, D=3 →6243.

Check changing a to1:1243.

1243 ÷7=177.571… 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4 → remainder4. Not good.

So invalid.

Next, B=3.

B=3,

A=3 -6= -3 mod7=4.

C=9 -2=7 mod7=0.

D=6 -15= -9 mod7= -2=5.

So A=4, C=0, D=5.

N=4 3 0 5 →4305.

Check changing a to1:1305.

1305 ÷7=186.428… 7*186=1302, 1305-1302=3 → remainder3. Not good.

Invalid.

B=4.

B=4,

A=3 -8= -5 mod7=2.

C=12 -2=10 mod7=3.

D=6 -20= -14 mod7=0.

So A=2, C=3, D=0.

N=2 4 3 0 →2430.

Check changing a to1:1430.

1430 ÷7=204.285… 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2 → remainder2. Not good.

Invalid.

B=5.

B=5,

A=3 -10= -7 mod7=0, but A can't be0.

So invalid.

B=6.

B=6,

A=3 -12= -9 mod7= -2=5.

C=18 -2=16 mod7=2.

D=6 -30= -24 mod7= -3=4.

So A=5, C=2, D=4.

N=5 6 2 4 →5624.

Check changing a to1:1624.

1624 ÷7=232. 7*232=1624. Exactly divisible.

Good.

Change b to1:5124.

5124 ÷7=732. 7*732=5124. Exactly.

Change c to1:5614.

5614 ÷7=802. 7*802=5614. Exactly.

Change d to1:5621.

5621 ÷7=803. 7*803=5621. Exactly.

Wow, N=5624 works.

Is this a higher N than 5694? No, because 5624 <5694.

But wait, perhaps there's a higher N for a=5.

Wait, let's see, with B=6, A=5, C=2, D=4. So N=5624.

But earlier with a=5, I had N=5694, which is higher and works.

So, perhaps N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let me check B=7.

B=7,

A=3 -14= -11 mod7= -4=3.

C=21 -2=19 mod7=5.

D=6 -35= -29 mod7= -1=6.

So A=3, C=5, D=6.

N=3 7 5 6 →3756.

Check changing a to1:1756.

1756 ÷7=250.857… 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6 → remainder6. Not good.

Invalid.

B=8.

B=8,

A=3 -16= -13 mod7= -6=1.

C=24 -2=22 mod7=1.

D=6 -40= -34 mod7= -6=1.

So A=1, C=1, D=1.

N=1 8 1 1 →1811.

Check changing a to1: same as N, which is1811.

1811 ÷7=258.714… 7*258=1806, 1811-1806=5 → remainder5. Not good.

Invalid.

So, the only valid N for a=5 is5694 and5624, with5694 being higher.

Thus, N=5694 is the maximum four-digit number satisfying the condition.

So, Q is the quotient when N is divided by1000, which is5, and R is the remainder, which is694.

Thus, Q + R=5 +694=699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then need to find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding the Condition**:
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number \( ABCD \).
   - Changing any digit \( A, B, C, \) or \( D \) to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7.

2. **Setting Up Congruences**:
   - Expressing the modified numbers and setting up congruences modulo 7.
   - Deriving relationships between the digits \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \).

3. **Solving for Digits**:
   - Through modular arithmetic, we find that \( A \) must be congruent to 1 modulo 7, giving possible values \( A = 1 \) or \( 8 \).
   - Testing higher values for \( A \) (like 8) leads to contradictions, so we settle on \( A = 5 \) as the highest valid digit.

4. **Finding \( N \)**:
   - With \( A = 5 \), solving the congruences leads to \( B = 6 \), \( C = 9 \), and \( D = 4 \).
   - Thus, \( N = 5694 \).

5. **Calculating \( Q \) and \( R \)**:
   - Dividing \( N = 5694 \) by 1000 gives \( Q = 5 \) and \( R = 694 \).
   - Summing these gives \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{699}
