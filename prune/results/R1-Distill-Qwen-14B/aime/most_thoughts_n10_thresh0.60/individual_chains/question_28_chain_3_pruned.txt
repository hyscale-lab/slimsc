Alright, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (which is the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n/p, and then I have to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I only know the edge lengths? I think I need to use something called the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember it's a formula that gives the volume based on the edge lengths. Let me recall the formula.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

Volume² = (1/288) * | determinant of the matrix |

The matrix is a 5x5 matrix, right? Let me write it out. The matrix looks like this:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

So, plugging in the given edge lengths.

Wait, let me note down all the given edges:

AB = √41 => a = √41, so a² = 41
AC = √80 => b = √80, b² = 80
AD = √89 => c = √89, c² = 89
BC = √89 => d = √89, d² = 89
BD = √80 => e = √80, e² = 80
CD = √41 => f = √41, f² = 41

So, the matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check:

- Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² → 1,0,41,80,89
- Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² → 1,41,0,89,80
- Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD² → 1,80,89,0,41
- Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0 → 1,89,80,41,0

Yes, that looks correct.

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That seems a bit daunting, but maybe I can find a pattern or simplify it somehow.

Alternatively, maybe I can notice that the tetrahedron is isohedral because the opposite edges are equal. Wait, what's an isohedral tetrahedron? It's one where all edges are the same length? No, wait, maybe it's one where opposite edges are equal. Let me think.

Yes, in this case, AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC. So, it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. I think it's called a disphenoid. So, in a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, and the formula for the volume is a bit simpler. Maybe I can use that.

I recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt[(a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)]) / (6√2)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I confused it with something else.

Wait, another approach: since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, it can be embedded in a rectangular box. So, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that they're aligned with the box.

Let me try that. Let me assign point A at (x, y, z), B at (-x, -y, z), C at (-x, y, -z), and D at (x, -y, -z). This setup ensures that opposite edges are
