Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. So, there are two rectangles. Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Let's say rectangle ABCD has AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, AB is the length, and BC is the width. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is longer than AB, and FG is shorter than BC.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F in that order? Or maybe a different order? Hmm, not sure yet. Also, all four points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circumference.

I think it would help to assign coordinates to these points so I can better visualize their positions. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, the coordinates of the other points can be determined based on that.

So, if D is at (0, 0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (BC, 0) because BC is the side opposite to AD. Wait, no, actually, BC is a vertical side. Wait, no, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB is a horizontal side, and BC is vertical. So, if D is at (0, 0), then point C would be at (BC, 0)? Wait, maybe I got the sides mixed up.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is adjacent to BC. So, ABCD is a rectangle, so the order of the points is important. Let me think: ABCD is a rectangle, so the points are arranged as A, B, C, D, right? So, AB is one side, BC is the next, CD is opposite to AB, and DA is opposite to BC.

So, if D is at (0, 0), then perhaps point C is at (0, BC). Wait, no, because BC is vertical if AB is horizontal. Wait, maybe I should fix the coordinate system.

Let me place point D at (0, 0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, if AB is 107, that's the horizontal side, so point A would be at (x, y), and point B would
