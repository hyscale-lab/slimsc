Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f and g are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I should probably understand what these functions f and g look like. Let's start with f(x). The expression is the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2. So, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let me think, what does that graph look like? Well, |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 would shift it down by 1/2, but since we're taking the absolute value again, it might create a W-shape or something similar.

Wait, more precisely: The inner function is |x| - 1/2. So, when |x| is 1/2, that inner part becomes zero. So, for |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so the absolute value would flip it, making it 1/2 - |x|. For |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So, the graph of f(x) is a V-shape with the vertex at (0, 1/2). Wait, no: actually, when |x| is 0, f(x) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. At |x|=1/2, f(x) = 0. Then, as |x| increases beyond 1/2, f(x) increases again, so it's a V-shape with the vertex at (0, 1/2), but it's symmetric about the y-axis, and it's a 'W' because when |x| is between 0 and 1/2, it's decreasing, then increasing beyond 1/2. Wait, no, that's actually a tent map or something. Let me sketch it mentally.

Wait, actually, f(x) = ||x| - a|, which for a=1/2 would have a V shape with the minimum at x=0, but no, wait. Wait, when x is 0, f(0)=|0 - 1/2|=1/2. When x is 1/2, |1/2|=1/2, so f(1/2) = |1/2 -1/2|=0. Similarly, at x=-1/2, same. For x beyond 1/2, |x| -1/2 is positive, so f(x) just becomes |x|
