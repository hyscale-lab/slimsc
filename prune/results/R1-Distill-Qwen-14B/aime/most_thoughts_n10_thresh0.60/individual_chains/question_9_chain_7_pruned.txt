Okay, so I have this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can break this down step by step.

First, let's write down what's given. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. I remember that log_b(a^k) is equal to k * log_b(a). So applying that here, log_x(y^x) becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Got that. So, equation one simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So equation two is 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I have two equations:
1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I need to find a relationship between x and y. I recall that log_b(a) is the reciprocal of log_a(b). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). That could be helpful here.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A. Let's substitute this into the equations.

So equation one becomes x * A = 10.

Equation two becomes 4y * (1/A) = 10.

Now, I have two equations:
1. x * A = 10
2. (4y) / A = 10

Hmm, I can solve these simultaneously. Maybe express x and y in terms of A?

From equation one: x = 10 / A.

From equation two: 4y = 10A => y = (10A) / 4 => y = (5A)/2.

Now, I have x and y in terms of A. But since log_x(y) = A, perhaps I can express this in terms of A as well.

Wait, log_x(y) = A. But log_x(y) is the exponent to which x must be raised to get y. So, x^A = y.

But from earlier, I have y = (5A)/2, so substituting that in, x^A = (5A)/2.

But I also have x = 10/A. So x^A = (10/A)^A = (5A)/2.

Wait, so (10/A)^A = (5A)/2.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to simplify.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

A * ln(10/A) = ln( (5A)/2 )

Hmm, that's still a bit messy, but perhaps I can expand it.

Left side: A * (ln(10) - ln(A)).

Right side: ln(5A) - ln(2) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2).

So, putting it all together:

A*(ln(10) - ln(A)) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Let me rearrange this equation:

A*ln(10) - A*ln(A) - ln(A) + ln(2) - ln(5) = 0.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which probably can't be solved algebraically. Maybe I can make some smart substitutions or find a value of A that satisfies this.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution I can make earlier on to avoid getting into such a complicated equation.

Wait, let's go back. We have:

x = 10 / A

y = (5A)/2

And x^
