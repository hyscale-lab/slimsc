Okay, so I've got this problem: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The problem says the diagram shows three of those rectangles, but since I don't have the diagram, I'll have to visualize it or perhaps sketch it out.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A regular dodecagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, since the formula for each internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 is (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. 

Now, I'm supposed to find rectangles inside this dodecagon. The sides of these rectangles must lie on either the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon. So, essentially, the sides of the rectangles must align with some edges or diagonals of the dodecagon.

I think the key here is that in a regular polygon, the diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, the different diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, up to 5 vertices. Because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating on the other side. So, for example, skipping 6 vertices would be the same as going the other way around since 12/2=6.

Wait, let me clarify that. In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the longest diagonal is the one that connects a vertex to the vertex directly opposite it. For a dodecagon, that would skip 5 vertices because if you number the vertices from 0 to 11, vertex 0 is opposite vertex 6, but to get from 0 to 6, you skip 5 vertices (1,2,3,4,5). So, the diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, five different lengths of diagonals.

So, for a dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be thought of as lines connecting vertices with a certain step between them. Each side connects adjacent vertices (step 1), diagonals connect vertices with steps 2, 3, 4, 5. So, a rectangle in this context must have its sides aligned with two pairs of these lines, such that the opposite sides are equal and parallel.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the same length, but the diagonals have different lengths. So, for a rectangle to be formed, the sides must be aligned with diagonals (or sides) of the same length and parallel.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, certain diagonals are parallel. For example, in a regular hexagon, the longest diagonals are all parallel. So, perhaps in a regular dodecagon, the diagonals that skip the same number of vertices are parallel. Because that would
