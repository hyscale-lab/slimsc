Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about the residents of Aimeville. Let me read it again and break it down.

There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one thing. Then, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. So, those are the four items: candy hearts, diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. But wait, actually, candy hearts is something everyone owns. So, maybe the other three are optional. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given for everyone. The other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are additional. So, some people might own none of those, some might own one, two, or all three.

Then, we're told that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is to find the number of residents who own all four things.

Wait, but since everyone owns the candy hearts, does that mean the four things are candy hearts plus the other three? Because the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one item. So, the four items are: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond ring, golf clubs
