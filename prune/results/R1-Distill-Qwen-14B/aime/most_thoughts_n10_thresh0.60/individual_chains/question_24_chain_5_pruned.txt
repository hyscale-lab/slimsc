Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a list of positive integers with three specific properties: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items.

First, let's understand each condition.

1. **Sum of the list is 30**: That means when we add up all the numbers in the list, they total 30.

2. **Unique mode is 9**: Mode is the number that appears most frequently. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. No other number can appear as many times as 9, or else there wouldn't be a unique mode.

3. **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. Since it's a positive integer but not in the list, that means the median is a number that isn't part of the list but is the middle value when the list is ordered.

Our goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items. To do that, we first need to determine what the list of numbers is.

Let's think about how the list is structured. The median depends on the number of elements in the list. Let's denote the number of elements as n. The median is the (n+1)/2-th term when n is odd, or the average of the n/2-th and (n/2 +1)-th terms when n is even.

But wait, the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, the median can't be one of the numbers in the list. That suggests that for even n, the average of the two middle numbers isn't in the list. Alternatively, for odd n, the middle number is not in the list, which seems impossible because the middle number is part of the list. Wait, that can't be. Hmm, maybe n is even because if n is odd, the median is the middle number, which must be in the list, but the problem says the median isn't in the list. Therefore, n must be even.

So, n is even. Let's denote n = 2k, where k is an integer. Then, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th terms. Since the median is an integer not in the list, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer, but it's not present in the list.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's denote the two middle numbers as a and b. Then, (a + b)/2 is the median, which is an integer. So, a + b must be even, meaning a and b are both even or both odd. Since the median is not in the list, neither a nor b can be equal to the median.

Now, considering the mode is 9, which appears more often than any other number. So, 9 must appear at least twice, but perhaps more. Let's see.

Let me try to construct such a list.

First, let's assume the list has n elements. Since the sum is 30, the average is 30/n.

But let's think about possible values of n. The list must have at least one 9 because the mode is 9. Let's try to find the minimal case where 9 is the mode.

If 9 appears twice, then other numbers can appear at most once. Let's see.

But wait, if n is small, say n=5, which would be odd. Then the median is the 3rd term, which would have to be in the list, but the problem says the median is not in the list. So n can't be 5. So n has to be even. Let's try n=6.

n=6: the median is the average
