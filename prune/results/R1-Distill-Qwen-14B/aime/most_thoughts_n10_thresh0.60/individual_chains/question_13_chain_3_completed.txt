Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's walks. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find how many minutes her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm. So, the key here is that the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop equals the total time given. The coffee shop time is the same in both scenarios, which makes sense because she still stops there regardless of her walking speed. So, the variable t is constant in both cases.

Let me break down the information:

First scenario:
- Speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours (which is 4*60 = 240 minutes)
- Includes walking time and t minutes in the coffee shop.

Second scenario:
- Speed: s+2 km/h
- Total time: 2 hours and 24 minutes (2*60 +24 = 144 minutes)
- Includes walking time and the same t minutes in the coffee shop.

We need to find the total time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes.

So, let's denote the walking time without the coffee shop as T. Then, the total time including coffee is T + t.

In the first scenario:
Walking time = (9 km) / (s km/h) = 9/s hours. Convert this to minutes: (9/s)*60 minutes.

So, total time for first scenario: (9/s)*60 + t = 240 minutes.

Similarly, in the second scenario:
Walking time = (9 km) / (s+2 km/h) = 9/(s+2) hours. Convert to minutes: (9/(s+2))*60.

Total time: (9/(s+2))*60 + t = 144 minutes.

Hmm, so I have two equations here:

1) (540)/s + t = 240
2) (540)/(s+2) + t = 144

Because 9*60 = 540. So, the walking time in minutes is 540/s for the first case, and 540/(s+2) for the second.

Now, I can subtract the two equations to eliminate t.

Equation 1: (540/s) + t = 240
Equation 2: (540/(s+2)) + t = 144

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(540/s - 540/(s+2)) = 240 - 144
540/s - 540/(s+2) = 96

Let me factor out 540:

540*(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 96

Simplify the expression in the parenthesis:

( (s+2) - s ) / (s(s+2)) ) = 2 / (s(s+2))

So,

540*(2)/(s(s+2)) ) = 96

Which is:

(1080)/(s(s+2)) ) = 96

Now, let me solve for s(s+2):

1080 = 96 * s(s+2)
Divide both sides by 96:

1080 / 96 = s(s+2)

Let me compute 1080 ÷ 96:

96 * 11 = 1056, so 1080 - 1056 = 24, so 11 and 24/96 = 11.25

So,

s(s+2) = 11.25

Which is a quadratic equation:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me solve for s using quadratic formula.

s = [ -2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) ) ] / (2*1)
s = [ -2 ± sqrt(4 + 45) ] / 2
sqrt(49) is 7.

So,

s = ( -2 +7 ) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

Or s = ( -2 -7 ) / 2 = -9/2, which is negative, so we can discard that because speed can't be negative.

So, s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, we can find t from one of the equations, say equation 1:

(540)/s + t = 240

Substitute s=2.5:

540 / 2.5 + t = 240

540 divided by 2.5: 540 ÷ 2.5 = 216

So,

216 + t = 240 => t = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is, when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time, which is walking time plus t.

Walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then, add t, which is 24 minutes.

So, total time is 180 +24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Walking time at 3 km/h is 9/3 = 3 hours, which is indeed 180 minutes. t is 24 minutes. So, 180 +24 = 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.


Aya's walking speed and coffee shop time can be determined using the given scenarios. By setting up equations for the total time in each case and solving, we find her speed \( s = 2.5 \) km/h and coffee shop time \( t = 24 \) minutes. When she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is 3 hours (180 minutes), and adding the coffee shop time gives a total of 204 minutes.

The final answer is \(\boxed{204}\).
