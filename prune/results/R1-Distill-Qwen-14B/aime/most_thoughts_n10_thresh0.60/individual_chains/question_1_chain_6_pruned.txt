Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2 of ratios of these variables. Then it's asking me to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by writing down the given equations to get a clearer picture.

First equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2.

Second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3.

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4.

So, each of these logs equals a fraction, which suggests that each ratio inside the log is a power of 2. Since log₂(something) = a number, that means that the something is 2 raised to that number.

So, for the first equation, log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2 implies that x/(y z) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2).

Similarly, the second equation: y/(x z) = 2^(1/3).

Third equation: z/(x y) = 2^(1/4).

Okay, so I can rewrite each of these as:

1. x = y z * sqrt(2)  => x = sqrt(2) y z.

2. y = x z * 2^(1/3) => y = 2^(1/3) x z.

3. z = x y * 2^(1/4) => z = 2^(1/4) x y.

Now, this gives me three equations with x, y, z in terms of each other. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms of one variable or find a relationship between them.

Let me try substituting equation 2 into equation 1.

From equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.

Plug this into equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * (2^(1/3) x z) * z.

Simplify the right side: x = sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3) * x * z^2.

So, x = (2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3)) x * z^2.

Wait, 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) is 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6). So, x = 2^(5/6) x z^2.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by x (since x is positive, can't be zero). Then:

1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.

So, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6).

Which is the same as z^2 = 2^(-5/6).

Taking square roots: z = 2^(-5/12), since z is positive.

Wait, let me check: 2 * (-5/12) is -5/6, so yes, that's correct.

So z = 2^(-5/12).

Okay, so z is found. Now, can I use this to find y or x?

Looking back at equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.

We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y.

Divide both sides by 2^(1/4):

x y = 2^(-5/12 - 1/4).

Let me compute the exponent: -5/12 - 1/4. Since 1/4 is 3/12, it's -5/12 - 3/12 = -8/12 = -2/3.

So, x y = 2^(-2/3).

So, equation A: x y = 2^(-2/3).

Now, from equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.

We already know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:

y = 2^(1/3) x * 2^(-5/12).

Multiply the exponents: 2^(1/3 -5/12). Let's compute 1/3 -5/12.

1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 -5/12 = -1/12.

So, y = 2^(-1/12) x.

So, y = 2^(-1/12) x.

So, from this, y is 2^(-1/12) times x.

Now, let's plug this into equation A: x y = 2^(-2/3).

Substitute y:

x * (2^(-1/12) x) = 2^(-2/3).

Which is x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3).

So, x^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12).

Dividing exponents: subtract the exponents.

So, x^2 = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12).

Compute -2/3 + 1/12: -8/12 + 1/12 = -7/12.

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12).

Taking square roots, x = 2^(-7/24).

Since x is positive.

So, x is 2^(-7/24).

Now, since y = 2^(-1/12) x, plug in x:

y = 2^(-1/12) * 2^(-7/24) = 2^(-1/12 - 7/24).

Compute the exponents: -1/12 is -2/24, so -2/24 -7/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.

So, y = 2^(-3/8).

So, now I have x, y, z:

x = 2^(-7/24),

y = 2^(-3/8),

z = 2^(-5/12).

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²).

First, let's express x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2, which they already are.

So, x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6).

Similarly, y³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8).

z² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6).

So, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).

When you multiply terms with the same base, you add exponents.

So, exponent is (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).

Let me compute that.

First, find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have a common denominator of 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24,

-9/8 = -27/24,

-5/6 = -20/24.

Add them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

Simplify: 75 and 24 have a common factor of 3. 75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8.

So, it's -75/24 = -25/8.

Thus, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8).

So, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

Therefore, the absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25 and n=8. They are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, no common factors.

So, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, let me
