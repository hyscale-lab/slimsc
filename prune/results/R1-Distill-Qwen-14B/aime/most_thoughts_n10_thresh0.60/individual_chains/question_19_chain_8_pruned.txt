Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumradius is 13, the inradius is 6, and the incenter I is perpendicular to the line joining the circumcenter O and I. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but let's take it step by step.

First, let me recall some basic properties of triangle centers. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, if I imagine triangle ABC, with O somewhere outside or inside depending on the triangle type, and I somewhere inside, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line connecting O to I.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check if that's correct. Yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, in this case, OI would be sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. That gives us a right angle at I between IA and OI. So, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I.

So, in triangle OIA, we have:

- OI = sqrt(13) (from Euler's formula)
- IA is the inradius, which is 6? Wait, no. Wait, IA is not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, but IA is the distance from I to vertex A. So IA is not equal to r; IA is longer than r. Hmm, so I can't directly say IA is 6.

Wait, so in triangle OIA, which is right-angled at I, by Pythagoras theorem:

OA²
