Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus inscribed in it. Let me try to visualize what's going on. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis.

The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals aren't necessarily equal, but they do intersect at 90 degrees and bisect each other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, it makes sense that the points A, B, C, D are arranged symmetrically around the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C, which is opposite, would be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin as well.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. Let me note that. So, the diagonals AC and BD must be perpendicular to each other.

Let me denote the coordinates of the four points. Let’s say point A is (x1, y1), then point C is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, points B and D would be (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2) respectively. So, the four points are (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (-x1, -y1), (-x2, -y2), forming a rhombus.

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, for point A: (x1²)/20 - (y1²)/24 = 1, and similarly for point B: (x2²)/20 - (y2²)/24 = 1.

Now, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Vector AC goes from A to C, which is (-x1 - x1, -y1 - y1) = (-2x1, -2y1). Similarly, vector BD goes from B to D, which is (-x2 - x2, -y2 - y2) = (-2x2, -2y2).

The condition for the diagonals to be perpendicular is that their dot product is zero. So, the vectors AC and BD must have a dot product of zero.

Wait, actually, no. The diagonals are AC and BD, so their direction vectors would be from the origin. So, AC is the vector from the origin to C, which is (-x1, -y1), and BD is the vector from the origin to D, which is (-x2, -y2). Wait, no. AC as a diagonal is the line connecting A and C, which is a straight line through the origin, so the direction vectors are just scaled versions of each other. Similarly for BD.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of slopes. The slope of AC is (y1 - (-y1))/(x1 - (-x1)) = (2y1)/(2x1) = y1/x1. Similarly, the slope of BD is (y2 - (-y2))/(x2 - (-x2)) = (2y2)/(2x2) = y2/x2.

Since AC and BD are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, (y1/x1) * (y2/x2) = -1.

So, (y1 y2) / (x1 x2) = -1. Therefore, y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

That's one equation we have.

Another thing we need is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, (x1²)/20 - (y1²)/24 = 1, and the same for (x2, y2).

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, the lengths of the sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

Let me calculate the distance between A and B. A is (x1, y1), B is (x2, y2). So, the distance squared is (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)². Similarly, the distance between B and C is (x1 - x2)² + (-y1 - y2)² = same as above. Wait, but actually, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so not only AB equals BC, but all sides must be equal.

Wait, perhaps we can use another condition. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, so the sides can be calculated using the lengths of the diagonals.

Let me denote the lengths of the diagonals AC and BD as 2p and 2q respectively. So, AC has length from (x1,y1) to (-x1,-y1), which is sqrt[( -x1 -x1 )² + ( -y1 -y1 )²] = sqrt[ ( -2x1 )² + ( -2y1 )² ] = sqrt[4x1² + 4y1²] = 2 sqrt(x1² + y1²). So, the length of AC is 2p, so p = sqrt(x1² + y1²). Similarly, the length of BD is 2q, so q = sqrt(x2² + y2²).

In a rhombus, the area is (diagonal1 * diagonal2)/2, so (2p * 2q)/2 = 2pq. Alternatively, the area can be calculated as the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AD.

But maybe more relevant here is the relation between the diagonals and the sides. In a rhombus, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals. Each side is equal to sqrt(p² + q²). Because the diagonals are perpendicular, they form right triangles with the sides as hypotenuses.

So, the length of each side of the rhombus is sqrt(p² + q²). So, the distance between A and B must be equal to sqrt(p² + q²).

But let's compute the distance between A and B. Point A is (x1, y1), point B is (x2, y2). So, the distance squared is (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2. This should equal (sqrt(p² + q²))^2 = p² + q².

So, (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = p² + q².

But p² is (sqrt(x1² + y1²))² = x1² + y1², and q² is x2² + y2². So, substituting:

(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x1² + y1²) + (x2² + y2²).

Expanding the left side:

x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1².

So, left side is x1² + x2² - 2x1x2 + y1² + y2² - 2y1y2.

Set equal to right side x1² + y1² + x2² + y2².

So, subtracting right side from both sides:

-2x1x2 - 2y1y2 = 0.

Dividing both sides by -2:

x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

So, we have another equation: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

Earlier, we had the condition from the slopes: y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

So, substituting y1 y2 from the slopes condition into the other equation:

x1x2 + (-x1 x2) = 0.

Which simplifies to 0 = 0. So, it's consistent, but doesn't give us new information. That suggests we need another equation.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, no. If we have two conditions:

1. y1 y2 = -x1 x2 (from the slopes being perpendicular)
2. x1x2 + y1y2 = 0 (from the sides being equal)

But substituting 1 into 2 gives x1x2 + (-x1x2) = 0, which is 0=0, so no new information. So, these two conditions are not independent. Therefore, we need another condition.

Perhaps we can express y1 in terms of x1 from the hyperbola equation.

From the hyperbola equation for point A: (x1²)/20 - (y1²)/24 = 1. So, y1² = 24*(x1²/20 - 1) = (24/20)x1² -24 = (6/5)x1² -24.

Similarly, y2² = (6/5)x2² -24.

So, maybe we can use these expressions for y1² and y2².

Also, from condition 1: y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

Let me square both sides of condition 1:

(y1 y2)^2 = (x1 x2)^2.

But from the hyperbola equations, y1² = (6/5)x1² -24 and y2² = (6/5)x2² -24.

So, [ (6/5)x1² -24 ] * [ (6/5)x2² -24 ] = (x1 x2)^2.

Let me write this equation out:

[(6/5 x1² -24)(6/5 x2² -24)] = x1² x2².

Expanding the left side:

(6/5 x1²)(6/5 x2²) + (6/5 x1²)(-24) + (-24)(6/5 x2²) + (-24)(-24) = x1² x2².

Calculating each term:

First term: (36/25)x1² x2².

Second term: (-144/5)x1².

Third term: (-144/5)x2².

Fourth term: 576.

So, putting it all together:

36/25 x1²x2² - (144/5)x1² - (144/5)x2² + 576 = x1²x2².

Bring all terms to one side:

36/25 x1²x2² - (144/5)x1² - (144/5)x2² + 576 - x1²x2² = 0.

Combine like terms:

(36/25 - 1)x1²x2² - (144/5)(x1² + x2²) + 576 = 0.

Compute 36/25 -1: that's 36/25 -25/25 = 11/25.

So, 11/25 x1²x2² - (144/5)(x1² + x2²) + 576 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate denominators:

11 x1²x2² - (144/5 *25)(x1² + x2²) + 576*25 = 0.

Compute each coefficient:

144/5 *25 = 144*5 = 720.

576*25 = 14,400.

So, equation becomes:

11 x1²x2² -720(x1² + x2²) +14,400 =0.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a substitution.

Let me note that from condition 1: y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

So, let's denote k = x1 x2. Then, y1 y2 = -k.

Also, from the hyperbola equations, we have:

y1² = (6/5)x1² -24.

Similarly, y2² = (6/5)x2² -24.

So, y1² y2² = [(6/5)x1² -24][(6/5)x2² -24].

But y1² y2² = (y1 y2)^2 = k².

So, k² = [(6/5)x1² -24][(6/5)x2² -24].

Which is the same as the equation we had earlier.

Wait, perhaps we can express x1² and x2² in terms of each other. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe we can denote t = x1² and s = x2². Then, since y1² = (6/5)t -24, and y2² = (6/5)s -24.

Also, from the condition y1 y2 = -x1 x2 = -sqrt(t s). Wait, but if x1 x2 = k, then sqrt(t s) = |k|, so y1 y2 = -k = -sqrt(t s) or sqrt(t s). Wait, but since y1 and y2 could be positive or negative, maybe the product could be positive or negative. But in any case, the square is positive.

Wait, but in our earlier substitution, we have:

k = x1 x2.

Then, y1 y2 = -k.

So, y1 y2 = -k.

But y1² y2² = (y1 y2)^2 = k². So, we have:

[(6/5)t -24][(6/5)s -24] = k².

But k = x1 x2, so k² = t s.

So, [(6/5)t -24][(6/5)s -24] = t s.

Let me write this out:

(6/5 t -24)(6/5 s -24) = t s.

Multiply out the left side:

(6/5 t)(6/5 s) - (6/5 t)(24) - (6/5 s)(24) + (24)^2 = t s.

Which is:

(36/25) t s - (144/5) t - (144/5) s + 576 = t s.

Bring all terms to the left-hand side:

36/25 t s -144/5 t -144/5 s +576 - t s = 0.

Combine like terms:

(36/25 -1) t s -144/5 t -144/5 s +576 = 0.

Compute 36/25 -1 = (36 -25)/25 = 11/25.

So, equation becomes:

11/25 t s -144/5 t -144/5 s +576 =0.

Multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate denominators:

11 t s -720 t -720 s +14,400 = 0.

So, 11 t s -720 t -720 s +14,400 = 0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of t and s. Maybe we can factor this equation or find a relationship between t and s.

Let me try grouping terms:

11 t s -720 t -720 s = -14,400.

Factor the left side:

t s (11) -720 t -720 s = -14,400.

Hmm, perhaps factor terms with t and s:

t (11 s -720) -720 s = -14,400.

Wait, maybe not the most straightforward way. Alternatively, let's try to factor it as:

11 t s -720 t -720 s + (something) = something.

Wait, maybe add a constant to both sides to factor it.

Alternatively, we can treat this as a linear equation in terms of t and s, but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, let's treat t as a variable and s as a function of t, or vice versa.

Alternatively, we can use substitution.

Let me try to factor:

11 t s -720 t -720 s = -14,400.

Let me factor 11 t s -720 t -720 s.

Hmm, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as:

11 t s -720(t + s) = -14,400.

Hmm, perhaps not immediately helpful.

Alternatively, we might consider adding a constant to both sides to make it factorable.

Let me think: 11 t s -720 t -720 s + C = -14,400 + C.

We need to choose C such that the left side can be factored.

Let me see:

Suppose we write it as (a t + b)(c s + d) = ... ?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of t and s as variables and try to find a relationship.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that we have two variables t and s, but not another equation. So, perhaps we need to find a parametrization or find a way to express s in terms of t or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another condition I haven't considered yet.

Wait, we have another equation from the hyperbola: points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so we have:

(x1²)/20 - (y1²)/24 = 1,

and

(x2²)/20 - (y2²)/24 = 1.

We've already used these to get y1² = (6/5)x1² -24 and y2² = (6/5)x2² -24.

Additionally, we have the condition from the product of slopes: y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

Which led us to the equation 11 t s -720 t -720 s +14,400 = 0.

So, unless we can find another equation, perhaps we can consider symmetry or parameterization.

Wait, perhaps since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are arranged such that the diagonals are along certain lines. Maybe we can parametrize points A and B in terms of angles.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize point A as (x, y) on the hyperbola, then point C is (-x, -y). Points B and D can be found such that BD is perpendicular to AC, and BD passes through the origin.

Wait, since diagonals are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, perhaps points B and D lie on the line that's perpendicular to AC.

So, since AC has a slope of y/x, then BD has a slope of -x/y.

So, points B and D lie on the line with slope -x/y.

So, parametrizing points B and D on both sides of the origin along that line.

Let me try to write this.

Let me denote point A as (x, y). Then, point C is (-x, -y).

The line AC has slope y/x. Therefore, the line BD, being perpendicular, has slope -x/y.

So, points B and D lie on the line y = (-x/y) * x, but wait, that would be y = (-x/y) X, where X is the variable.

Wait, actually, the line BD passes through the origin and has slope -x/y. So, its equation is Y = (-x/y) X.

So, any point on BD can be written as (k, (-x/y)k), where k is a scalar.

So, points B and D are symmetric with respect to the origin, so if B is (k, (-x/y)k), then D is (-k, (x/y)k).

But points B and D must lie on the hyperbola.

So, let me substitute point B into the hyperbola equation:

(k)^2 /20 - [ (-x/y k)^2 ] /24 = 1.

Simplify:

k² /20 - (x² / y² * k²)/24 = 1.

Factor out k²:

k² [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)] =1.

So, k² = 1 / [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)].

But since point A (x, y) is on the hyperbola, we have x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

Let me solve for y² in terms of x².

From the hyperbola equation: y² = (24/20) x² -24*1 = (6/5)x² -24.

So, y² = (6x² -120)/5.

So, plug this into the expression for k²:

k² = 1 / [1/20 - (x²)/(24*(6x² -120)/5)].

Simplify denominator:

First, compute 24*(6x² -120)/5: 24*(6x² -120)/5 = (144x² -2880)/5.

So, denominator: 1/20 - x² / [ (144x² -2880)/5 ].

Let me compute each term:

1/20 = 0.05.

Second term: x² divided by (144x² -2880)/5.

Which is x² * 5 / (144x² -2880) = (5x²) / (144x² -2880).

So, denominator is 1/20 - [5x²/(144x² -2880)].

To combine these terms, I'll bring them to a common denominator.

Let me factor denominator 144x² -2880: 144(x² -20).

So, 144(x² -20).

So, denominator becomes:

[ (144(x² -20)) * 1/20 -5x² ] / [144(x² -20)].

Wait, no. To combine 1/20 and [5x²/(144x² -2880)], which is 5x²/(144(x² -20)).

Let me write 1/20 as (something over 144(x² -20)).

So, 1/20 = [7.2(x² -20)] / [144(x² -20)].

Wait, that seems messy.

Alternatively, let me factor 144x² -2880 as 144(x² -20).

So, the denominator is 1/20 - [5x² / (144(x² -20))].

Let me write both terms over a common denominator of 20 * 144(x² -20):

= [144(x² -20) - 100x²] / [20 * 144(x² -20)].

Compute numerator:

144(x² -20) -100x² =144x² -2880 -100x² =44x² -2880.

So, denominator is (44x² -2880) / [20 *144(x² -20)].

Therefore, k² = 1 / [ (44x² -2880)/(20*144(x² -20)) ) ] = [20*144(x² -20)] / (44x² -2880).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 20 *144 * (x² -20) = 2880 (x² -20).

Denominator: 44x² -2880 =44(x² - 2880/44) =44(x² - 65.4545...). Wait, not so helpful.

Wait, 44x² -2880 = 4*(11x² -720).

Hmm, 2880 is 44*65.4545, but perhaps it's better to factor numerator and denominator:

2880 (x² -20) / [44x² -2880] = [2880 (x² -20)]/[44x² -2880].

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2880(x² -20) = 2880 x² -57,600.

Denominator:44x² -2880 = 44x² -2880.

Not much in common. Let me see if I can factor 44x² -2880 = 4*(11x² -720).

And 2880=44*65.4545, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps write 44x² -2880 = 44(x² - 2880/44) =44(x² - 65.4545). Not helpful.

Wait, let me compute 2880 divided by 44:

2880 /44 = 2880 ÷44 = 65.4545, as above.

Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator as multiples:

2880 = 44 *65 + something. Wait, 44 *65=2860, so 2880=44*65 +20.

So, 2880=44*65 +20.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps factor 44x² -2880 as 4*(11x² -720). Let me see:

44x² -2880 =4*(11x² -720).

Similarly, 2880(x² -20) =2880x² -57,600.

Wait, 57,600 is 240². Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write k² as:

k² = [2880 (x² -20)] / [44x² -2880] = [2880 (x² -20)] / [44(x² - 2880/44)].

So, that's [2880 /44] * [ (x² -20) / (x² - 2880/44) ].

2880/44 = 65.4545... ≈65.45.

But perhaps, instead of approximating, let's write it as fractions.

2880 ÷44: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 720/11.

So, 2880/44=720/11.

Therefore, k² = [720/11] * [ (x² -20) / (x² -720/11) ].

Hmm, that might be helpful. Let me write it as:

k² = (720/11) * [ (x² -20)/(x² -720/11) ) ].

Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of parametrizing point A as (x, y), we can parametrize it using hyperbola parametric equations.

For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, parametric coordinates are (a secθ, b tanθ).

So, in our case, a²=20, so a=2√5, and b²=24, so b=2√6.

So, point A can be parametrized as (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ).

Similarly, point C would be (-2√5 secθ, -2√6 tanθ).

Then, points B and D lie on the line with slope -x/y, which, when point A is (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ), the slope is -(2√5 secθ)/(2√6 tanθ) = -(√5 secθ)/(√6 tanθ) = -(√5)/(√6 sinθ).

So, the line BD has slope m = -√5/(√6 sinθ).

So, points B and D can be parametrized along this line. Let me denote points B and D as (k, m k) and (-k, -m k), since they are symmetric about the origin.

So, point B is (k, m k) = (k, [ -√5/(√6 sinθ) ] k).

Since point B lies on the hyperbola, substitute into the hyperbola equation:

k² /20 - [ (m k)^2 ] /24 =1.

So, k² /20 - [ (m² k² ) ] /24 =1.

Factor out k²:

k² [ 1/20 - m² /24 ] =1.

So, k² = 1 / [1/20 - m² /24 ].

Compute m²:

m = -√5/(√6 sinθ), so m² = 5/(6 sin²θ).

So, m² =5/(6 sin²θ).

Substitute into denominator:

1/20 - [5/(6 sin²θ)] /24 =1/20 -5/(144 sin²θ).

So, denominator is 1/20 -5/(144 sin²θ).

Thus, k² =1 / [1/20 -5/(144 sin²θ)].

Let me compute this:

First, find a common denominator for the terms in the denominator:

The common denominator is 720 sin²θ.

So, 1/20 = 36 sin²θ / (720 sin²θ),

and 5/(144 sin²θ) =25 sin²θ / (720 sin²θ).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1/20 is equal to (1/20)*(something over sin²θ) to get the denominator.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write:

1/20 -5/(144 sin²θ) = (144 sin²θ - 100)/(2880 sin²θ).

Wait, let's compute:

1/20 = 144 sin²θ / (2880 sin²θ),

5/(144 sin²θ) =5 * 20 / (2880 sin²θ) =100/(2880 sin²θ).

So, 1/20 -5/(144 sin²θ) = [144 sin²θ -100]/(2880 sin²θ).

Thus, k² =1 / [ (144 sin²θ -100)/(2880 sin²θ) ) ] =2880 sin²θ / (144 sin²θ -100).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2880 sin²θ / (144 sin²θ -100) = [2880 sin²θ] / [144 sin²θ -100].

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2880 sin²θ= 20*144 sin²θ.

Denominator:144 sin²θ -100= 4(36 sin²θ -25).

Wait, 36 sin²θ -25 can be written as (6 sinθ -5)(6 sinθ +5). Maybe helpful.

So, k²= [20*144 sin²θ] / [4(36 sin²θ -25)] = [20*36 sin²θ]/(36 sin²θ -25).

Because 144/4=36.

So, k²= (720 sin²θ)/(36 sin²θ -25).

Hmm, so k²=720 sin²θ/(36 sin²θ -25).

But 36 sin²θ -25 must not be zero, so sin²θ ≠25/36.

Which implies sinθ ≠5/6 or -5/6. So, θ cannot be such that sinθ is 5/6.

But okay, now we can relate this to the other points.

Wait, but we also have the condition that the points form a rhombus, so the sides must be equal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use this parametrization to find BD².

Wait, our aim is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the supremum of BD², and then the greatest number less than that.

BD is the diagonal from B to D. Since B is (k, m k) and D is (-k, -m k), the distance BD is the distance between (k, m k) and (-k, -m k).

Which is sqrt[ ( -k -k )² + ( -m k - m k )² ] = sqrt[ (-2k)^2 + (-2 m k)^2 ] = sqrt[4k² +4 m² k²]=2k sqrt(1 + m²).

So, BD²=4k²(1 +m²).

From earlier, we have k²=720 sin²θ/(36 sin²θ -25).

So, BD²=4*(720 sin²θ/(36 sin²θ -25))*(1 +m²).

But m²=5/(6 sin²θ), so 1 +m²=1 +5/(6 sin²θ)= (6 sin²θ +5)/(6 sin²θ).

Thus, BD²=4*(720 sin²θ/(36 sin²θ -25)) * (6 sin²θ +5)/(6 sin²θ).

Simplify each part:

First, 4 *720 =2880.

So, BD²=2880 sin²θ/(36 sin²θ -25) * (6 sin²θ +5)/(6 sin²θ).

Let me write each term:

2880 sin²θ * (6 sin²θ +5) / [ (36 sin²θ -25)(6 sin²θ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2880 sin²θ (6 sin²θ +5).

Denominator: (36 sin²θ -25)(6 sin²θ).

So, write as:

[2880 (6 sin²θ +5) sin²θ ] / [6 sin²θ (36 sin²θ -25) ].

Cancel 6 sin²θ in numerator and denominator:

2880 (6 sin²θ +5) / [6 (36 sin²θ -25) ].

Simplify 2880 /6 =480.

So, BD²=480 (6 sin²θ +5) / (36 sin²θ -25).

So, BD²=480*(6 sin²θ +5)/(36 sin²θ -25).

Let me denote u = sin²θ. Then, u is between 0 and1, since it's sin squared.

But wait, looking back, we had k²=720 sin²θ/(36 sin²θ -25). The denominator must be positive because k² is positive.

So, 36 sin²θ -25>0 → sin²θ >25/36 → sinθ>5/6 or sinθ<-5/6.

But since sinθ is squared, we can write sin²θ>25/36.

So, u>25/36.

But u= sin²θ ≤1. So, u is in (25/36, 1].

So, BD²=480*(6u +5)/(36u -25).

So, now, we can consider BD² as a function of u in (25/36,1].

We need to find the infimum of BD² over u in (25/36,1], because the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we're looking for the minimal possible BD², because the supremum would be infinity, but perhaps the infimum is the minimal BD².

Wait, no, wait. The problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, we need to find the infimum of BD², because the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum.

Wait, let me think: for all rhombi, BD² can get as small as approaching some limit. So, the greatest number less than all BD² is the infimum.

So, we need to find the minimum value of BD², which is the infimum of BD² over u>25/36.

Wait, but let me compute the expression for BD²:

BD²=480*(6u +5)/(36u -25).

Let me write this as:

BD²=480*(6u +5)/(36u -25)=480*[ (6u +5)/(36u -25) ].

Let me denote f(u)=(6u+5)/(36u -25). So, BD²=480 f(u).

We need to find the minimum value of f(u) for u ∈ (25/36,1].

Let me compute f(u)= (6u +5)/(36u -25).

Let me see how f(u) behaves as u approaches 25/36 from above and as u approaches 1.

First, compute the limit as u approaches 25/36 from the right.

At u=25/36:

f(25/36)=(6*(25/36) +5)/(36*(25/36) -25)= (25/6 +5)/(25 -25)= (25/6 +30/6)/0= (55/6)/0 → infinity.

So, as u approaches 25/36+, f(u) approaches +infinity, so BD² approaches +infinity.

At u=1:

f(1)= (6*1 +5)/(36*1 -25)=11/11=1.

So, BD²=480*1=480.

So, as u approaches 1, BD² approaches 480.

Now, check if f(u) has a minimum in between u=25/36 and u=1.

Compute derivative of f(u) to find its extrema.

f(u)=(6u +5)/(36u -25).

Compute f’(u):

f’(u)= [ (6)(36u -25) - (6u +5)(36) ] / (36u -25)^2.

Simplify numerator:

6*(36u -25) -36*(6u +5).

=216u -150 -216u -180.

= (216u -216u) + (-150 -180).

=0 -330 = -330.

Thus, f’(u) = -330 / (36u -25)^2.

Since denominator is squared, it's always positive for u>25/36.

So, f’(u)= -330 / positive = negative.

Therefore, f(u) is decreasing on u ∈ (25/36,1].

So, f(u) decreases from +infinity to 1 as u increases from 25/36 to1.

Therefore, the minimum of f(u) is 1, achieved when u=1.

Thus, the minimal BD² is 480*1=480.

Therefore, BD² can be as small as 480, but cannot be smaller than that.

Wait, but BD² approaches 480 as u approaches1, and is larger for u approaching 25/36.

So, the infimum of BD² is 480.

Thus, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480, since BD² is always greater than or equal to 480.

Wait, but the question says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be equal to 480, then 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, but since BD² can be equal to 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound.

Wait, but the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi," so if BD² can be equal to 480, then 480 cannot be less than BD² for all rhombi, because for the rhombus where BD²=480, it's not less. So, perhaps the supremum is 480, but we need the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, no, perhaps I have it inverted.

Wait, no, the infimum is the greatest lower bound, meaning that BD² is always greater than or equal to 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because BD² is always at least 480, so any number less than 480 would not be less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, no, that can't be. If BD² is always ≥480, then any number less than 480 would be less than BD² for all rhombi. But the problem asks for the greatest such number. So, since 480 is the infimum, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is just below 480. But since we need an integer, perhaps 480 is the minimal BD², so the answer is 480, but the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, the number must be less than the minimal BD², which is 480. So, the greatest integer less than 480 is 479. Wait, but wait, the question says "greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be as small as 480, then any number less than 480 would satisfy being less than BD² for all rhombi. The greatest such number is 480 itself, but 480 is not less than BD² for all rhombi because it's equal to BD² for some rhombus. So, the supremum of numbers less than BD² for all rhombi is 480. But since 480 is attainable, the next lower number is 480 minus epsilon, but since we need the greatest real number, it would be 480. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, if BD² can be equal to 480, then 480 is not less than BD² for all rhombi, because for the rhombus with BD²=480, 480 is not less than BD². Therefore, the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi is the supremum of all numbers less than the minimal BD², which is 480. Since the minimal BD² is 480, the supremum of numbers less than BD² is 480.

But wait, in real numbers, the supremum of all numbers less than 480 is 480 itself. So, technically, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, but it's not less than BD² for all rhombi because in the case where BD²=480, it's equal. Therefore, the answer must be the supremum of BD², but I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that BD² can be made as close to 480 as desired, but not less than 480. So, the infimum is 480, and the numbers less than BD² for all rhombi must be less than or equal to 480. But since 480 is attainable, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480. However, since 480 is attainable, it's not less than BD² for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is approaching 480 from below, but not including 480. But since the problem says "greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi," and BD² can approach 480, the answer must be 480. But that's contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the minimal BD². Let me double-check.

We had BD²=480*(6u +5)/(36u -25), where u=sin²θ>25/36.

We found that as u approaches 25/36 from above, BD² approaches infinity, and as u approaches 1, BD² approaches 480.

Since f(u) is decreasing, BD² is minimized when u=1, giving BD²=480.

Therefore, BD² can be as small as 480, but cannot be smaller. So, BD² ≥480.

Hence, the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480, but since BD² can be equal to 480, it's not less than BD² for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is the supremum of all numbers less than 480, which is 480 itself.

But that's confusing because 480 is not less than BD² for all rhombi—it's equal for some. So, perhaps the correct answer is 480, but it's the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because if BD² can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal BD² is 480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is approaching 480, but not reaching it. But since the problem asks for a real number, not necessarily an integer, perhaps the answer is 480. But the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be 480, the number must be less than 480, so the greatest such number is 480. But that's a contradiction because 480 is not less than 480.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum, which is 480, so the greatest number less than or equal to BD² for all rhombi is 480. But the wording is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 480. Because BD² can be as small as 480, so any number less than 480 would not satisfy being less than BD² for all rhombi (since some rhombi have BD²=480). Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using vectors. Let me denote vectors OA and OB as vectors from the origin to points A and B.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, vectors OA and OB should satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so vectors OA and OB are along the diagonals. Wait, no, in our case, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

Wait, but in the parametrization earlier, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that AC and BD are diagonals intersecting at the origin.

So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

Wait, vector AC is from A to C: (-2x1, -2y1).

Vector BD is from B to D: (-2x2, -2y2).

Their dot product is zero: (-2x1)(-2x2) + (-2y1)(-2y2)=4x1x2 +4y1y2=0.

Divide both sides by 4: x1x2 + y1y2=0.

Which is consistent with our earlier condition.

So, we have x1x2 + y1y2=0.

Also, from the slopes, we have y1y2= -x1x2.

So, substituting into the equation: x1x2 + (-x1x2)=0, which holds.

So, perhaps in this case, the minimal BD² is 480.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

But since BD² can be 480, the number must be less than 480. So, the greatest such number is 480, but since it's not less than BD² for all rhombi (it's equal for some), perhaps the answer is 480. I'm a bit confused, but given the calculations, I think the minimal BD² is 480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 480. I think that's the minimal BD², so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but the problem says "greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, since BD² can be as small as 480, the number must be less than or equal to 480. But the problem requires the number to be less than BD² for all rhombi. So, the number must be less than the minimal BD², which is 480. Therefore, the greatest such number is approaching 480 from below, but in real numbers, that's 480. But since 480 is attainable, perhaps the answer is 480. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me check the calculation again.

Earlier, we found that BD²=480*(6u +5)/(36u -25), where u=sin²θ>25/36.

We found that as u increases from 25/36 to 1, BD² decreases from infinity to 480.

So, BD² can be made as close to 480 as desired, but cannot be less than 480.

So, the minimal BD² is 480.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

But wait, no. Because for all rhombi, BD²≥480. So, any number less than 480 would be less than BD² for all rhombi. The greatest such number is 480, but since 480 is attainable, 480 is not less than BD² for all rhombi. Therefore, the answer is 480.

Wait, but 480 is the minimal BD², so it's the infimum. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480. But that seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 480, but I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think the minimal BD² is 480, so the answer is 480.


To solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, and all four vertices lie on the hyperbola.

1. **Hyperbola Equation**: Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) satisfy \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).

2. **Perpendicular Diagonals**: The slopes of \(AC\) and \(BD\) multiply to \(-1\), leading to the condition \(y_1 y_2 = -x_1 x_2\).

3. **Equal Side Lengths**: The distances between consecutive vertices are equal, leading to the condition \(x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 = 0\).

4. **Parametrization**: Using hyperbola parametric equations, points \(A\) and \(B\) are parametrized as \((2\sqrt{5} \sec\theta, 2\sqrt{6} \tan\theta)\) and \((k, -\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{6} \sin\theta}k)\), respectively.

5. **BD Length Calculation**: After substituting into the hyperbola equation and simplifying, the length of diagonal \(BD\) is found to be \(BD^2 = 480 \cdot \frac{6u + 5}{36u - 25}\), where \(u = \sin^2\theta\).

6. **Minimization**: The function \(BD^2\) is minimized as \(u\) approaches 1, yielding \(BD^2 = 480\).

7. **Conclusion**: Since \(BD^2\) can be as small as 480, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is **480**.

\boxed{480}
