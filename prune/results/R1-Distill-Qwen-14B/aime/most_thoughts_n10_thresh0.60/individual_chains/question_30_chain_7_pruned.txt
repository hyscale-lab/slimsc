Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I know that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. That means ω has an order of 13, right? So, ω^k for k = 0,1,2,...,12 gives all distinct roots.

The product given is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let's denote this product as P. So, P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

I wonder if there's a way to simplify each term in the product. Let me look at the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or rewrite it in a more manageable form.

Let me see: let's factor out a 2 from the first two terms. So, 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let's see:

Let x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, 2 - 2x + x^2. Is this factorable? Let's check the discriminant of the quadratic: b² - 4ac = (−2)^2 − 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over the complex numbers?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of this as x^2 - 2x + 2. So, x^2 - 2x + 2. Maybe I can relate this to a cyclotomic polynomial or something like that.

Wait, cyclotomic polynomials... since ω is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But not sure how that connects yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that x^2 - 2x + 2 relates to (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), since the roots are 1 ± i. So, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, each term in the product is (x - (1 + i
