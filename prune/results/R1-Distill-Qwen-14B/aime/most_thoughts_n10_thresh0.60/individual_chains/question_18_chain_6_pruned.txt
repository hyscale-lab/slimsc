Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. 

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a twelve-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives ((12-2)*180)/12 = 150 degrees. 

Now, the problem is about counting rectangles. Rectangles require four sides with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals might not naturally form right angles. Wait, but in a regular polygon, certain diagonals can create right angles when connected appropriately. So I need to figure out which combinations of diagonals and sides can form rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a number of sides that's a multiple of 4, like a square (4-gon), octagon (8-gon), etc., you can form rectangles by connecting vertices in specific ways. A dodecagon is 12-sided, which is a multiple of 4 as well (12 = 3*4), so maybe similar principles apply.

Let me think about how rectangles are formed in a regular polygon. A rectangle is defined by four vertices where the sides are parallel and the angles are 90 degrees. In a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a dodecagon, a side connects adjacent vertices, a diagonal can connect vertices with one vertex in between, two in between, etc.

But for a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, the sides that are parallel are those that are opposite each other. Similarly, certain diagonals can also be parallel. So, perhaps the key is to find sets of four vertices that form a rectangle by having two pairs of these parallel lines.

Wait, in a regular polygon, if the number of sides is divisible by 4, like 12 is, then it's possible to have multiple rectangles. Each rectangle can be identified by choosing two diametrically opposite sides (or diagonals) and two other diametrically opposite sides (or diagonals) that are perpendicular to the first pair.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of coordinates. If I assign coordinates to the vertices of the dodecagon, then I can use coordinate geometry to determine the conditions required for four points to form a rectangle.

Let me model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Then, the coordinates of the vertices can be given by (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. Since it's regular, each vertex is spaced by 30 degrees because 360/12 = 30
