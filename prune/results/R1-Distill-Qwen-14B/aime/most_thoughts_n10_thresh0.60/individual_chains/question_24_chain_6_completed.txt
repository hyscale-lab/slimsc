Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties.

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And the question is asking for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the same page.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. It's unique here, so only 9 appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of elements, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because it means the median must be an integer, but it's not one of the numbers in the list.

Alright, so the first step is probably to figure out the structure of the list. Let me think about the constraints.

1. Sum is 30. So the total of all numbers is 30.
2. Mode is 9, and it's unique. That means 9 must appear more times than any other number.
3. Median is an integer not in the list. Hmm, so the median is the middle value, but it's not part of the list. That suggests that if the list has an odd number of elements, the middle one isn't 9? Or maybe it has even number of elements, and the median is the average of two middle numbers which sum to an integer, but the median itself isn't in the list.

Let me think about the possibilities for the number of elements in the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements.

Given that the mode is 9, 9 must appear at least twice because you need at least two of the same number to have a mode. But since it's the unique mode, it has to appear more times than any other number.

Let me consider possible values of n.

First, let's think about the smallest possible n where 9 is the mode. Since 9 is the mode, it has to appear more times than any other number.

Suppose n is 5. Then the list would have a middle number as the median, which is the 3rd number. If the median is not in the list, that can't happen because the median is the actual number in the list when n is odd. So n can't be odd because then the median would be part of the list, which contradicts the third condition.

Wait, that's an important point. If n is odd, the median is the middle number, which is part of the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Therefore, n must be even. Because when n is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not be an integer, but the problem says it is a positive integer. Also, that median doesn't have to be in the list.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. When n is even, the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th terms. So for example, if n=4, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd terms. If the average is an integer, but neither of the 2nd nor 3rd terms is that integer, then the median is not in the list.

So n has to be even. That's a crucial point.

So n is even. Let's note that.

So n is even. Let's denote n = 2k, where k is a positive integer.

Now, let's think about the structure of the list. Let's arrange the numbers in non-decreasing order. So, the list is a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ a_{2k}.

The median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2. This has to be an integer, and it's not part of the list.

So, the sum of a_k and a_{k+1} must be even, because their average is an integer. Therefore, a_k and a_{k+1} are either both even or both odd.

But since the median is not in the list, neither a_k nor a_{k+1} can be equal to the median.

So, for example, if the median is m, then a_k and a_{k+1} are such that (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2 = m, so a_k + a_{k+1} = 2m. But m is not in the list.

Therefore, a_k and a_{k+1} must add up to 2m, but both are different from m.

Wait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think. Suppose a_k = m-1 and a_{k+1}=m+1, then their average is m, which is not in the list. Or a_k and a_{k+1} could be two different numbers that average to m, but neither is m.

So that's a possibility.

Alternatively, they could both be m, but if both are m, then m would be in the list, which isn't allowed. Because the median is m, which is not in the list. So a_k and a_{k+1} can't both be m.

So a_k and a_{k+1} must be two numbers such that their average is m, but neither is m.

So for example, a_k = m-1 and a_{k+1}=m+1, which gives the average m.

Or a_k = m-2 and a_{k+1}=m+2, average m.

Or they could be other combinations as long as they add up to 2m.

But the key point is that m is not present in the list.

Now, let's also remember that the mode is 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

So, to satisfy the mode condition, the number 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.

So, if n is the length of the list, we need that the count of 9s is at least one more than the count of any other number.

So, for example, if another number appears twice, then 9 must appear at least three times.

Given that, and the sum is 30, we need to find a list that satisfies all these conditions.

Let's start considering the possible values of n.

Since the list has positive integers, n must be at least 2 because if n=1, the sum would be 30, but then the median would be 30, which is part of the list, which can't be.

Wait, but n can't be 1 because the mode would be 30, but the problem says the mode is 9. So n must be at least 2.

But wait, let's think. For n=2, the list is [a1, a2], sum is 30, so a1 + a2 =30.

The median is (a1 + a2)/2 =15, which is an integer. But then 15 would be the median, and it's not in the list. So the list would have two numbers, neither of which is 15.

But wait, the mode is 9, which would mean that 9 has to appear more than any other number. But in a list of two numbers, if both are 9, then the sum is 18, which is less than 30. So that's impossible.

Alternatively, if one number is 9, and the other is 21, then the sum is 30. The mode would be 9 and 21, both appearing once. So that's bimodal, but the problem states the mode is unique, 9. So that's not allowed.

Hence, n=2 is impossible.

So let's try n=4.

n=4: So the list has four numbers, arranged in order a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ a4.

Median is (a2 + a3)/2, which must be an integer, say m, and m is not in the list.

The mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.

So, 9 must appear at least twice, because if it appeared once, another number could also appear once, making it multimodal.

So, in the list of four numbers, 9 must appear at least twice.

But let's try to construct such a list.

Case 1: 9 appears twice.

So, the list has two 9s. Then, the other two numbers must be different from 9 and each other, because if another number also appears twice, then we have a bimodal situation, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, the other two numbers must each appear once.

So, the list would be something like: [x, y, 9, 9], but wait, arranged in order.

Wait, but if the two 9s are at the end, then the median is (a2 + a3)/2. Since the list is in order, a3 could be 9, but a2 would be something else.

Wait, let's suppose the list is [x, y, 9, 9]. Then the median is (y +9)/2 = m, an integer not in the list.

So, y +9 must be even, so y must be odd, because 9 is odd. So y +9 is even, so y must be odd.

So, m = (y +9)/2.

Since m is not in the list, which is [x, y, 9, 9], m must not be equal to x, y, or 9.

But x ≤ y ≤9.

Wait, if y is less than 9, then m = (y +9)/2. Since y is ≤9, let's see.

Suppose y is 7, then m = (7+9)/2=8. So m=8.

Is 8 in the list? The list is [x,7,9,9]. So x must be ≤7.

If x is 7, then the list is [7,7,9,9]. But then the mode is both 7 and 9, each appearing twice. That's bimodal, which is not allowed because the mode is unique.

So x must be less than 7, say 6. Then list is [6,7,9,9]. Mode is 9 (appears twice), 7 appears once, 6 once. So mode is 9, which is good.

Sum is 6+7+9+9=31, which is more than 30. Hmm, so that doesn't work.

We need the sum to be 30.

So, let's recalculate.

Let me think of the list as [x, y, 9, 9], sum is x + y +9 +9 =x + y +18=30. So x + y=12.

Also, the median is (y+9)/2 = m, an integer not in the list.

We also have that x ≤ y ≤9.

So, x + y=12.

Possible pairs (x,y) where x ≤ y ≤9 and x + y=12.

Possible options:

- (3,9): sum 12, but y=9. Then the list is [3,9,9,9]. Wait, no, wait, the list we're constructing is [x, y,9,9], but if y=9, then the list would be [3,9,9,9], which is four numbers. Wait, no, because in that case, y=9, so the list is [3,9,9,9]. But that's four numbers, but wait, in this case, 9 appears three times, which is more than the mode condition. But let's check the median.

Wait, the list is [3,9,9,9], so the median is (9 +9)/2=9. But the median is 9, which is in the list, which contradicts the condition that the median is not in the list. So that's not acceptable.

So, y can't be 9.

Next possible pair: (4,8). x=4, y=8.

List: [4,8,9,9]. Sum is 4+8+9+9=30. Good.

Now, the median is (8+9)/2=17/2=8.5. But the median has to be an integer. So 8.5 is not allowed. So that doesn't work.

Next pair: (5,7). x=5, y=7.

List: [5,7,9,9]. Sum is 5+7+9+9=30.

Median is (7+9)/2=16/2=8. So m=8.

Is 8 in the list? The list is [5,7,9,9]. No, 8 is not in the list. So that's good.

Also, the mode is 9, which appears twice, and the others appear once. So mode is unique. Perfect.

So that seems to satisfy all the conditions.

Wait, but let's check the count of 9s. It's two. Are there any other numbers with two occurrences? No, 5,7,9,9. So 9 is the unique mode.

Great. So the list could be [5,7,9,9]. Sum is 30.

Now, the median is 8, which is not in the list. So that's good.

Wait, but could there be another list with n=4 that also satisfies the conditions?

Let's see.

Another possible pair for x+y=12 is (6,6). Then the list would be [6,6,9,9]. But then 6 appears twice, and 9 appears twice. So the mode would be both 6 and 9, which is bimodal. So that's not allowed.

Another pair: (2,10). Wait, y=10, which is greater than 9. But in the list, we have a3=9 and a4=9. So y can't be greater than 9 because the list is sorted, and a3 is 9, so y must be ≤9. So (2,10) is invalid.

So the only valid pair is (5,7). So the list is [5,7,9,9].

Now, the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9² =25 +49 +81 +81= 25+49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.

Wait, but let me check if there are other possible n values. Maybe n=6.

Wait, n=6 would require a longer list, but perhaps the sum of squares would be different. Let me see.

So for n=6, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th terms, which should be an integer m not in the list.

So let's consider n=6.

The list would be [a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6].

Median is (a3 +a4)/2 = m, integer, and m is not in the list.

Also, the mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.

So, the count of 9s must be at least 3, since in a list of 6, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times.

Wait, no. Because if another number appears twice, 9 needs to appear more than that. So if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times.

If another number appears three times, then 9 needs to appear at least four times.

But given the sum is 30, let's see.

Let me try to construct such a list.

Suppose 9 appears three times.

Then, the other three numbers must sum to 30 - 3*9=30-27=3. But since all are positive integers, the sum of three numbers is 3, which can only be [1,1,1].

So the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9].

Wait, but is that sorted? Let's arrange it: [1,1,1,9,9,9].

Median is (a3 + a4)/2 = (1 +9)/2=10/2=5.

So m=5, which is not in the list. That's good.

Now, mode is 9, which appears three times, others appear once or thrice. Wait, 1 appears three times as well. So the mode is both 1 and 9, each appearing three times. That's bimodal, which is not allowed because the mode is unique.

So that's a problem. So n=6 with 9 appearing three times and 1 appearing three times won't work.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears four times.

Then, the sum contributed by 9s is 4*9=36, which is more than 30. So that's impossible.

So, n=6 with 9 appearing three times and another number appearing three times is bimodal, which is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears four times. But 4*9=36>30, which is impossible.

So, n=6 doesn't seem to work because either the sum is too big or it's bimodal.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears three times, and the other three numbers are different, each appearing once.

So, the sum of the other three numbers is 30 -27=3. So possible numbers could be 1,1,1, but that's three 1s, which brings back the bimodal issue. Alternatively, 1,1,1 is the only way to sum to 3 with three positive integers, since 1 is the smallest.

Wait, no, 3 can be 1+1+1, or 1+2+0, but 0 is not allowed as the numbers are positive integers. So the only way is 1,1,1.

Thus, making the list [1,1,1,9,9,9], which is bimodal. So n=6 is not possible.

So, n=4 seems to be the only possible even number where the conditions are satisfied.

Wait, but let's check n=6 again. Maybe if the other numbers don't all appear the same.

Wait, suppose 9 appears three times, and the other three numbers are 1,1,1. But that's the same as before, leading to bimodal.

Alternatively, what if the other three numbers are 1,2,0? But 0 is invalid.

So, no, n=6 doesn't work.

What about n=8? Let's see.

Wait, n=8: the list has 8 numbers. The sum is 30.

Wait, but 8 numbers, each at least 1, would have a minimum sum of 8. 30 is bigger, so possible.

But let's see if it's possible to construct such a list.

But wait, the more numbers we have, the more the sum is spread out, but 30 is fixed.

Wait, let me think. Let's try to see.

n=8, so the median is the average of the 4th and 5th terms.

So, (a4 +a5)/2 =m, integer, not in the list.

Also, the mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.

So, 9 must appear at least twice, but more than any other number.

Let me try to construct such a list.

Suppose 9 appears three times.

Then, the sum of the other five numbers is 30 -3*9=30-27=3.

So, the other five numbers must sum to 3, which are positive integers. The minimal sum for five positive integers is 5 (all ones). So 5 ≤3? No, that's impossible. So 9 can't appear three times.

Wait, that's a problem. So 3*9=27, and 30-27=3, which can't be achieved with five positive integers because the minimum sum is 5. So 9 can't appear three times in n=8.

So, 9 must appear at least four times.

Then, sum from 9s is 4*9=36, which is more than 30. So that's impossible.

So n=8 is impossible.

Similarly, for higher n, the sum required for 9s would be even higher, which would make it impossible.

So, the only possible n is 4, where the list is [5,7,9,9].

Wait, but let me check another possibility with n=4.

Wait, could 9 appear three times in n=4?

If 9 appears three times, then the sum contributed by 9s is 27, so the fourth number would be 3.

So the list would be [3,9,9,9]. Sum is 3+9+9+9=30.

Now, the median is (9+9)/2=9. But the median is 9, which is in the list. That's not allowed because the median must not be in the list.

So that's invalid.

Thus, the only possible n is 4, with the list [5,7,9,9], which gives sum of squares 25+49+81+81=236.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there another possible list with n=4?

Suppose 9 appears twice, and the other two numbers are different.

We have x + y + 9 +9 =30 → x + y=12.

And (y +9)/2 =m, which must be integer, and m not in the list.

We found [5,7,9,9], but what about other possibilities.

For example, x=4, y=8. Then list is [4,8,9,9]. Sum is 4+8+9+9=30.

Median is (8+9)/2=17/2=8.5, which is not integer. So that's invalid.

Another pair: x=6, y=6. Then list is [6,6,9,9]. Sum is 6+6+9+9=30. Mode is 6 and 9, both appearing twice. Bimodal, which is invalid.

x=2, y=10: sum 12, but y=10>9, so the list would be [2,10,9,9], but when sorted, it's [2,9,9,10], so median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Invalid.

x=3, y=9: sum 12. List is [3,9,9,9]. Sum is 3+9+9+9=30. But median is 9, which is in the list. Invalid.

x=1, y=11: y=11>9. Sorted list is [1,9,9,11]. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Invalid.

So the only valid pair is x=5, y=7, leading to list [5,7,9,9].

So that's the only possible list for n=4.

Therefore, the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25 +49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.

Wait, but let me check if there's a list with n=6 that I missed.

Wait, earlier I thought n=6 is impossible because of the sum constraints, but maybe I made a mistake.

Let me try again.

n=6: the list has six numbers.

The sum is 30.

The mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.

The median is (a3 +a4)/2 =m, integer not in the list.

So, let's try to construct such a list.

Let me assume 9 appears three times.

Sum of 9s is 27, so the remaining three numbers sum to 3. But three positive integers summing to 3 must be 1,1,1. So the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9].

But then the mode is both 1 and 9, each appearing three times. Bimodal, which is invalid.

Alternatively, can I have 9 appear four times? 4*9=36>30. No.

So, 9 must appear three times, but that leads to bimodal.

Wait, another approach: maybe the other numbers have duplicates but less than three times.

Wait, but if 9 appears three times, the other three numbers must sum to 3, which can only be 1,1,1. So that's the only way.

Thus, n=6 is impossible.

So, the only possible list is n=4 with [5,7,9,9], sum of squares 236.

Wait, but wait another thought: could the list have other numbers besides 5,7,9?

Like, maybe 9 appears twice, and other numbers appear once, but with more numbers.

Wait, but n=4 is the only possible even n where the sum can be 30 with 9 appearing twice, and the other numbers summing to 12, which allows for a valid list.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the list has more than four elements, but with 9 appearing more times.

Wait, let me think about n=6 again. Suppose 9 appears four times.

Sum of 9s is 36, which is more than 30, impossible.

n=5: impossible because n must be even.

n=3: same problem as n=1, median would be part of the list.

n=2: as discussed earlier, impossible.

n=6: as above, impossible.

n=8: as above, impossible.

So, the only possible list is [5,7,9,9].

Thus, the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25+49+81+81=236.

Wait, but let me double-check the sum.

5+7+9+9=30. Correct.

Median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list.

Mode is 9, appearing twice, others appear once. So 9 is the unique mode.

Yes, that works.

So the answer should be 236.


To solve the problem, we analyze the constraints step by step.

1. **Sum of the list**: The total is 30.
2. **Unique mode**: The number 9 appears more frequently than any other number.
3. **Median**: The median is an integer not present in the list, implying the list has an even number of elements.

### Key Steps:
- **Mode Constraint**: Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice. Additionally, no other number can appear the same number of times as 9.
- **Even Number of Elements**: The median being an integer not in the list implies the list has an even number of elements. For an even-length list, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be an integer but not present in the list.
- **Testing Possible List Lengths**:
  - **n=4**: The only feasible length that satisfies all constraints. The list must be structured such that 9 appears twice, and the other two numbers sum to 12. The valid list is [5, 7, 9, 9].
  - **n=6, 8, etc.**: These lengths either exceed the sum constraint or result in bimodal lists, which are invalid.

### Valid List:
The list [5, 7, 9, 9] satisfies all conditions:
- Sum: \(5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30\).
- Mode: 9 appears twice, more than any other number.
- Median: \((7 + 9)/2 = 8\), which is an integer not in the list.

### Sum of Squares:
Calculate the sum of the squares of the elements:
\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]

**Answer**: \boxed{236}
