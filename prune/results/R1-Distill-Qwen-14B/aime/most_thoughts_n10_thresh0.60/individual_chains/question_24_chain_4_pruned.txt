Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down and understand each part.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties.

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's tackle each property one by one and see how they can help me construct the list or at least narrow down the possibilities.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers are in the list, when added together, they must equal 30. That gives me a constraint on the total.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. And it's unique, so no other number can have the same frequency as 9.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. For it to not be in the list, the number of elements must be even because the median in an even-length list is the average of the two middle numbers. Wait, no, that's not quite right. For an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which can be a non-integer if those two numbers are different. But in this case, the median is a positive integer, so if the list has an even number of elements, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number so that their average is an integer. Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the exact middle number, which must be an integer. However, in that case, the median would have to appear in the list, right? Because it's one of the numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So that can't happen if the number of elements is odd because the median would have to be in the list. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements.

So the number of elements, let's call it n, must be even. That way, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is an integer not present in the list.

Let me summarize:

- Sum of elements: 30
- Mode is 9, unique
- Number of elements even, n = 2k for some integer k
- Median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, which is an integer not in the list

So, the median is an integer, so either a_k and a_{k+1} are both equal and even, or they are two different numbers that add up to an even number, meaning they are both odd or both even. Wait, but if a_k and a_{k+1} are the same, then that number would appear in the list, making it the median. But the problem states that the median isn't in the list, so a_k and a_{k+1} must be different, and their average is an integer not in the list.

Wait, but if they're different, then their average is an integer only if their sum is even, so a_k and a_{k+1} must be both odd or both even.

Also, since the median isn't in the list, the two middle numbers can't be the same, because if they were the same, that number would be the median and would appear in the list, which contradicts the third condition.

So, the two middle numbers must be different, even if one is higher than the other, but their average is an integer not present in the list.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can consider possible values of n, the number of elements in the list.

Since the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, n can't be too big. The minimal n is 1, but with n=1, the median is the only number, which would have to be 30, but then the mode would also be 30, which doesn't match the condition that the mode is 9. So n must be at least 2.

Wait, but if n is 2, the sum is 30, so the two numbers would have to add up to 30. The median would be (a1 + a2)/2. For the median to not appear in the list, a1 and a2 must not be equal because then the median would be equal to both, which are in the list. Wait, but if n=2, the two numbers must be different because if they are the
