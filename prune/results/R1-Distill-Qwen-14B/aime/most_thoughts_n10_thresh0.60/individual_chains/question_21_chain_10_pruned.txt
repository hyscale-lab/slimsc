Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let's try to understand what a b-eautiful integer is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, that means n must be between b^1 and b^2 - 1, right? Because in base b, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b which is equal to b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So, if n in base b is written as d1 d0, then n = d1*b + d0, and d1 + d0 = sqrt(n).

Our goal is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me try to structure this.

First, let's express n in base b as a two-digit number: n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1 and at most b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.

Also, the sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum should equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c.

But n is equal to a*b + c, so substituting, we get:

sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a*b + c) = (a + c)^2

So expanding the right side:

a*b + c = a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2

Let me rearrange this equation:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can reorganize the terms:

a^2 - a*b + 2*a*c + c^2 - c = 0

Alternatively, let's collect like terms:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So, for given values of b and c, we can solve for a.

Wait, but a and c are digits in base b, so a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can treat this as a quadratic in a and see for which c there are integer solutions for a.

Let me write the quadratic equation:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0

This is a quadratic in a: A a^2 + B a + C = 0, where:

A = 1
B = 2c - b
C = c^2 - c

The discriminant D of this quadratic must be a perfect square for a to be an integer. Because a is a digit, it must be an integer.

The discriminant D is:

D = B^2 - 4AC = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c^2 - c)

Let me compute D:

(2c - b)^2 = 4c^2 - 4b c + b^2

4AC = 4*(c^2 - c) = 4c^2 -4c

So D = (4c^2 -4b c + b^2) - (4c^2 -4c)

Simplify:

4c^2 -4b c + b^2 -4c^2 +4c = (-4b c +4c) + b^2 = (-4c (b -1)) + b^2

So D = b^2 -4c(b -1)

This must be a perfect square for a to be an integer.

So, D = k^2 for some integer k.

Thus,

b^2 -4c(b -1) = k^2

Let me rearrange this:

b^2 - k^2 =4c(b -1)

Which can be written as:

(b -k)(b +k) =4c(b -1)

Hmm, interesting. So the product of (b -k) and (b +k) equals 4c times (b -1).

Since c is a digit in base b, c ranges from 0 to b-1. So 4c(b-1) is a multiple of (b-1), and ranges from 0 to 4*(b-1)*(b-1).

Wait, but c can't be too large because n is a two-digit number, which is less than b^2. So, maybe we can find a way to express this equation and find possible c and k.

But this might get a bit complicated. Maybe let's think differently.

We have:

sqrt(n) = a + c

Which implies that n must be a perfect square, right? Because sqrt(n) is an integer here, since a and c are integers, and a + c is an integer, so sqrt
