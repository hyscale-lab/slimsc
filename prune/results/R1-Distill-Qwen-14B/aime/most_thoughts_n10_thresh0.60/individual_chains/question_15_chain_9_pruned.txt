Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The condition is that the path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out.

First, I remember that without any restrictions, the number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have a restriction on the number of direction changes, which complicates things.

So, what does it mean for a path to change direction exactly four times? Well, in a grid path, you can only move either right (R) or up (U). Each time you switch from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change. So, if a path has exactly four direction changes, how does that break down?

Let me think. The path starts either with R or U. Each time it changes direction, it alternates. So, if it starts with R, then the sequence would be R, U, R, U, etc. Similarly, starting with U, it would be U, R, U, R, etc. The number of direction changes would be the number of times it switches from one direction to another.

Wait, so if the path changes direction exactly k times, then the number of runs (consecutive steps in the same direction) is k+1. For example, if you have zero direction changes, you have two runs: all R then all U, or all U then all R. But in our case, we have four direction changes, which means five runs.

So, the path is made up of five runs, alternating between R and U. Now, the key is to figure out how these runs are distributed between R and U steps.

Since the grid is 8x8, the total number of R steps is 8 and the total number of U steps is also 8. The runs of R and U steps must sum up to 8 for each direction.

Let me think about the possible distributions. Since we have five runs, which is an odd number, the number of runs for R and U will differ by one. Because each direction change alternates between R and U. So, if we start with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. That's three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, if we start with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U, which is three U runs and two R runs.

Wait, so in both cases, regardless of starting direction, we have three runs of one direction and two runs of the other. So, either three R runs and two U runs, or three U runs and two R runs. So, the problem is symmetric in R and U, so the number of such paths starting with R is equal to those starting with U. Therefore, I can compute the number for one case and double it, but wait, actually no, because it's symmetric, but the counts will be same regardless of starting direction. Hmm, perhaps I should consider both possibilities.

But maybe not, let's think again. The grid is 8x8, so moving from (0,0) to (8,8). Each path has 8 R and 8 U steps. So, if the path starts with R, then the number of R runs is (number of direction changes +1)/2 if the number of direction changes is odd. Since 4 is even, wait, no. Wait, direction changes are 4, which is even. So, number of runs is 5, which is odd. So, starting with R, we have (5 +1)/2 = 3 R runs, and starting with U, same thing. So, regardless of starting direction, the number of runs for each direction is 3 and 2.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If you have 5 runs, and you start with R, then the runs alternate R, U, R, U
