Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, the list is a collection of positive integers. Let's denote them as a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where n is the number of elements in the list.

First condition: Sum is 30. So, a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = 30.

Second condition: Unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list, and no other number has the same highest frequency. So, 9 must appear at least twice, and more than any other number.

Third condition: The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Wait, the median is a positive integer, which is not in the list. Interesting. So, the median is some integer m where m is not equal to any a_i, and m is the middle value of the sorted list.

I think I should start by considering the properties of the list.

First, since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, let's say 9 appears k times. Then, every other number in the list can appear at most k-1 times.

Also, the sum of all numbers is 30. So, the total is 30.

Another point: the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, the median is an integer m, and m is not in the list. Also, m is the middle value when the list is ordered.

So, the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Let's say the list has n elements, so the median is the middle element if n is odd, or the average of the two middle elements if n is even. But wait, the problem says the median
