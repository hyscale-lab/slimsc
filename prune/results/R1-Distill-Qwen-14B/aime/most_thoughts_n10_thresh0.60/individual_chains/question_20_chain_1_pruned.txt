Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to break it down. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I don't have to use all of them. Each cell can have at most one chip, and the conditions are that all chips in the same row or same column must be the same color. Also, the arrangement should be such that if I try to add any more chip, it would violate one of the previous two conditions. Hmm, that last part probably means the arrangement is maximal, right? So it's as filled as possible without violating the row and column color rules.

Let me start by understanding the constraints. Each row can have all white, all black, or no chips. Similarly, each column can have all white, all black, or no chips. But wait, if a row has some chips, all of them must be the same color, and the same goes for each column. So the color of a row and the color of a column can't conflict where they intersect.

Wait, that might be tricky. For example, if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection cell would have to be both white and black, which isn't possible. So that means that in the grid, for any cell, the row it's in and the column it's in must have the same color. So, if a row is white, all the columns that intersect it must also be white. Or if a column is black, all the rows that intersect it must be black. Hmm, so the colors of the rows and columns must be consistent.

So perhaps the grid is such that the rows are colored either white, black, or empty, and similarly for columns. But the way they interact is that a row and a column can't have conflicting colors in their intersection. So maybe all the rows that are colored white must align with columns that are colored white, and similarly for black.

So perhaps the grid is divided into blocks where all the rows in a block are the same color, and all the columns in that block are the same color, and different blocks have different colors. But how does that exactly translate?

Wait, another approach. Let's consider that each cell can be white, black, or empty. But if a row has any white chips, all the chips in that row
