Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume and the surface area.

But wait, the tetrahedron has these edges given in a symmetric way. Each pair of opposite edges are equal. AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. This kind of symmetry might mean it's a "isohedral" tetrahedron or something similar. Maybe it's a disphenoid? I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, yes, ABCD is a disphenoid.

In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent in pairs. Let me check: if opposite edges are equal, then each pair of opposite edges is equal, so each face is a triangle with sides from two pairs. So, maybe all four faces are congruent? Hmm, no, that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent if it's a regular tetrahedron, but here it's not regular because the edges are different. So, perhaps each face is congruent to its opposite face, but not all four. So, the surface area can be calculated by finding the area of two different triangles and doubling each.

But maybe there's a more straightforward way to compute the volume. Since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, there's a formula for the volume in terms of the edges.

I vaguely recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 72

Wait, no, that formula is for something else. Alternatively, maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant? Yes, that might be a solid approach.
