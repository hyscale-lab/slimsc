Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, okay. So this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, Alice goes first. If n is a losing position, then Bob can win. So I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position. Let me think about how to approach this.

Maybe I can model this using dynamic programming. I can define an array where each index represents the number of tokens, and the value is true if it's a winning position, false otherwise.

Wait, but how do I determine if a position is winning or losing? For a given n, if the current player can make a move that leads the opponent into a losing position, then the current position is a winning one. Conversely, if all possible moves lead to a winning position for the opponent, then the current position is a losing one.

So, starting from n=0, which is a losing position because there are no tokens to take. Wait, actually, if n=0, the game is over, so the player to move loses. So n=0 is a losing position.

Let me try to write down the initial positions:

n=0: losing (L)
n=1: can take 1 token, leading to n=0 (L). So n=1 is a winning (W) position.
n=2: take 1 to leave n=1 (W). But wait, if the current player takes 1, opponent is at W, which is bad. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because n=2 <4, so only can take 1. So if n=2, the player can only take 1, leaving n=1, which is a W for the opponent. So n=2 is L? Wait, no— if I
