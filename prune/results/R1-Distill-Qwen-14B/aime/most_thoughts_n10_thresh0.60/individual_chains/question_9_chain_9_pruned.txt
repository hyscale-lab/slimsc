Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. The problem says that there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can use the properties of logs to simplify these equations. Let me write down what I know.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using logarithm properties, I recall that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that here, this equation becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, log_x(y) is the exponent to which x must be raised to get y. Let me denote that as k. So, log_x(y) = k means that x^k = y. Therefore, the first equation becomes x * k = 10.

So, x * k = 10, and since k = log_x(y), which is the same as ln(y)/ln(x) in natural logs, maybe I can express this in terms of y.

But before that, let's look at the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, using the same logarithm property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Wait a second, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So if log_x(y) is k, then log_y(x) is 1/k.

Therefore, the second equation is 4y * (1/k) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. 4y / k = 10

Hmm, so let me write them down:

Equation 1: x * k = 10
Equation 2: (4y) / k = 10

I can perhaps solve these equations simultaneously. Let me see.

From equation 1, I can express x as 10 / k.

From equation 2, I can express 4y = 10k, so y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

Now, since I have x and y in terms of k, maybe I can find another equation that relates x and y to solve for k.

Earlier, I noted that log_x(y) = k. Since x^k = y, and I have expressions for x and y in terms of k, I can substitute them into this equation.

So, x is 10/k, and y is (5k)/2.

Therefore, x^k = y becomes (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let's write that out:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make this easier to handle.

ln[(10/k)^k] = ln[(5k)/2]

Using the logarithm power rule again, this becomes:

k * ln(10/k) = ln(5k/2)

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: k * [ln(10) - ln(k)]
Right side: ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

So, expanding left side:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Hmm, I'm not sure if this is getting me closer. Maybe I can rearrange terms.

Bring all terms to one side:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0

Combine like terms:

k ln(10) - (k ln(k) + ln(k)) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Factor out ln(k):

k ln(10) - ln(k)(k + 1) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

This seems messy. Maybe I should try a substitution. Let me denote t = k.

So, equation becomes:

t ln(10) - (t + 1) ln(t) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Not sure if that helps. Hmm, perhaps I can try to find t numerically or see if there's an integer value that satisfies this.

Wait, maybe I can assume that k is an integer? Let me test k=2.

If k=2,

Left side: 2 ln(10) - (2 + 1) ln(2) - ln(5) + ln(2)
= 2 ln(10)
