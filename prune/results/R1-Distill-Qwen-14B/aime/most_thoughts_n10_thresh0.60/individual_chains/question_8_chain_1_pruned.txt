Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums and products, sometimes symmetry can be exploited. The second equation is symmetric in a, b, c, so maybe that can help.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I notice that the second equation can be factored or perhaps rewritten in terms of symmetric sums. Let me think... Maybe I can factor out some terms.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c), similarly for the other terms. So, the equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let's substitute those in:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Expanding each term gives:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

So, combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. Now I have an equation involving the squares and cubes of a, b, c. Maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of the known sums.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, then (300)² = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me denote S = ab + bc + ca. Then, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2S.

Similarly, for the cubes, I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, and abc. The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Plugging in the known values:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*S + 3abc

300³ is 27,000,000. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc.

Now, let's go back to the equation from the second condition:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting the expressions I found:

300*(90,000 - 2S) - (27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2S) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S = 27,000,000 - 600S.

Then, subtracting (27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc) gives:

(27,000,000 - 600S) - 27,000,000 + 900S - 3abc = 6,000,000

Simplify this:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600S + 900S) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Which simplifies to:

300S - 3abc = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100S - abc = 2,000,000

So, now I have the equation:

100S - abc = 2,000,000

Which can be rewritten as:

abc = 100S - 2,000,000

Hmm, so now I have expressions involving S and abc. I need another equation to relate these terms. Let me recall that S is ab + bc + ca.

I know that a + b + c = 300, S = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. So, in terms of symmetric polynomials, these are the elementary symmetric sums.

I also know that for three variables, the relation between the sums is given by:

a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca)

Wait, but I already used that earlier. Maybe I can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express abc in terms of S and then substitute back into the equation.

From earlier, I have abc = 100S - 2,000,000.

I need another equation involving S and abc. Let me think about the original equations.

We have:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. ab + bc + ca = S
3. abc = 100S - 2,000,000

So, these are the three symmetric sums for a cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c. The cubic equation would be:

x³ - (a + b + c)x² + (ab + bc + ca)x - abc = 0

Which becomes:

x³ - 300x² + Sx - (100S - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Sx - 100S + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can find possible values of S that satisfy this.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So, S must be an integer, and abc must be nonnegative as well, since a, b, c are nonnegative.

From abc = 100S - 2,000,000, since abc is nonnegative, 100S - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 => S ≥ 20,000.

Also, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, the maximum possible S is when two variables are 150 and the third is 0, but actually, the maximum occurs when two are as large as possible. Wait, the maximum of ab + bc + ca is when two variables are as large as possible, given a + b + c = 300.

Wait, for two variables, say a and b, to maximize ab + bc + ca, we can set c = 0, then a + b = 300, and ab is maximized when a = b = 150, so ab = 22500, and ab + bc + ca = 22500. But wait, that's just when c is zero. Alternatively, if all three are positive, does ab + bc + ca get larger?

Wait, for a + b + c = 300, the maximum of ab + bc + ca occurs when all three variables are equal, right? Because of the AM-GM inequality. So, when a = b = c = 100, then ab + bc + ca = 3*(100*100) = 30,000.

Wait, that's higher than 22,50
