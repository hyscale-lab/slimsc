Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Interesting. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let's start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. So, AB is 107, and BC is 16. That means ABCD is a rectangle with length 107 and width 16. So, the sides AD and BC are both 16, and sides AB and CD are both 107.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. EF is 184, and FG is 17. So, EFGH is a rectangle with length 184 and width 17. So, sides EF and GH are 184, and sides FG and EH are 17.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points E and F are somewhere on the line that passes through D and C. Since ABCD is a rectangle, DC is one of its sides. Wait, DC would be equal to AB, so DC is 107. So, DC is a straight line of length 107, and E and F are somewhere on this line.

Wait, but E is also a corner of rectangle EFGH. So, EFGH is another rectangle, and EF is 184. So, EF is a side of the rectangle. But EF is 184, which is longer than DC which is 107. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe EFGH is placed such that E and F are on the extension of DC beyond C? Because DC is 107, but EF is 184, which is much longer. So, E is probably on one side, F on the other, extending beyond C.

Wait, but D is a point as well. Let me think. So, D is one corner of ABCD, and E is another point on the same line as D and C. So, the line is D-E-C-F, or maybe D-C-E-F? Hmm, I'm not sure. But given that D, E, C, F are collinear, and the order isn't specified, but from the context, probably D and C are the endpoints, and E and F are somewhere in between or extended beyond.

But since E is a corner of another rectangle, EFGH, which is connected to F and G and H. Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on a single circle. That must mean that ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. So, the four points A, D, H, G are on a circle.

Let me try to think about the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles must be 180 degrees. Alternatively, the power of a point might come into play here.

But maybe we can use coordinate geometry here. Let me assign coordinates to some of these points to make it easier.

Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me let point D be at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, CD is 107. So, moving from D (0,0), point C would be at (107,0). Point B would be at (0,16), and point A at (107,16). Wait, no, that's not right because in a rectangle, the sides are
