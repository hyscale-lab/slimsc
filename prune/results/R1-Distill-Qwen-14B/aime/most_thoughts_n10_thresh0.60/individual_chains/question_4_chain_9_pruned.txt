Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's see. So, I think this is a combinatorial game theory problem. Maybe I should model it using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the next player can force a win.

Let me try to list out the positions and see if I can find a pattern.

Start from small n:

n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So Bob can't win here. So position 1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1, Bob is left with 1. But in n=1, the player whose turn it is can take 1 and win. So when Alice takes 1 from n=2, Bob is faced with n=1, so Bob can take 1 and win. So does that mean n=2 is a losing position for Alice? Wait, but Alice is the first player.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of who is the player. Let me clarify:

For each n, we can define whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position for the current player.

Base cases:

n=0: The game is over, so this is a losing position because you can't make a move.

n=1: Current player can take 1 and win. So W.

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then can take it and win. Wait, so if n=2, current player takes 1, opponent is at n=1, which is a W position for them. So n=2 is a losing position? Because whatever you do, opponent can win.

Wait, let me think again. If n=2, you can take 1, leaving
