Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is called b-eautiful if when you express it in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, any two-digit number is of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. So, a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

So, the two-digit number in base b is n = a*b + c. The sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum should equal the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. Therefore, n must be a perfect square because the square root is an integer. 

Putting it all together, we have n = (a + c)^2, and also n = a*b + c. So, substituting, we get:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me rearrange that equation to see if I can find a relationship between a, c, and b. Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 = a*b + c.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange terms to group a and c terms:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0.

This looks like a quadratic equation in terms of a. So, for given c and b, this equation could have solutions for a.

Alternatively, maybe I can express b in terms of a and c. Let me try that.

From the equation: (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me solve for b:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c.

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a.

Simplify numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - c.

So,

b = (a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - c) / a.

We can split this fraction:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

Since b must be an integer (as it's a base), the term (c^2 - c)/a must be an integer as well. That means that a must divide (c^2 - c). 

So, a divides (c^2 - c). Let's note that c^2 - c = c(c - 1). So, a must be a divisor of c(c - 1). But remember that a is a digit in base b, so a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1. Also, since a is part of a two-digit number, a can't be zero.

So, for each base b, we can look for pairs (a, c) where a and c are digits in base b (a from 1 to b-1, c from 0 to b-1), and a divides c(c - 1). Then, for each such pair, we can compute b using the formula above and check if it's an integer.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of fixing b and looking for pairs (a, c), perhaps I should fix a and c and find possible b's. But since the problem is asking for the least b where there are more than ten such numbers, I might need to consider for each b, how many pairs (a, c) satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to parameterize the problem. Let me think.

We had earlier that (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me write this as:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a.

Which can be rewritten as:

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

So, as I mentioned earlier, since a must divide (c^2 - c), which is c(c - 1), a must be a divisor of c(c - 1).

So, for each c, c(c - 1) is a number, and a must be a divisor of that. But a is also a digit in base b, which implies that a < b (since a is the leading digit, it's at most b-1). Similarly, c is a digit, so c < b. 

Wait, but in the expression for b, we have b = a + 2c + (c(c - 1))/a. So, since a divides c(c - 1), let's denote k = c(c - 1)/a. Then, b = a + 2c + k.

But k must be an integer because a divides c(c -1). So, for each c, possible a's are the divisors of c(c -1), and for each such a, k is an integer, and then b
