Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. Since Alice goes first, Bob's goal is to always be able to respond in a way that forces Alice into a losing position. So I think this is a classic game theory problem where we can use the concept of winning and losing positions.

A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So I need to figure out for each n, whether it's a winning or losing position. Since the game is about taking 1 or 4 tokens, the possible moves from any position n are n-1 and n-4.

Let me start by listing out the positions and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's denote a position as losing (L) if the current player cannot force a win, and winning (W) otherwise.

n=0: Well, if there are zero tokens, the game is over, so the player who just moved has won. But since we're talking about the current player's turn, n=0 is a losing position because there are no tokens to take.

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So W.

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take the last token and win. Wait, no—wait, if n=2, taking 1 leaves n=1. The opponent can take 1 and win. Alternatively, can the player take 4? No, because there's only 2 tokens. So n=2: the player takes 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a losing position? Wait, but wait, that's not right because the player can take 1, and the opponent is forced to take 1 and win. So in that case, the player would lose. Wait, but the player's move is to take 1
