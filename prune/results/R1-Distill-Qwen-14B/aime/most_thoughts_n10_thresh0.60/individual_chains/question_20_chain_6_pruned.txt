Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. I need to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid. The conditions are:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So, the placement is maximal in some sense.

I think the third condition means that the configuration is such that you can't add any more chips without either having a cell with two chips or violating the color uniformity in rows or columns. So, the grid is filled as much as possible under the given constraints.

Let me try to model this. Since each row must have all chips of the same color, each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. Wait, but the third condition says that you can't add any more chips, so I think that implies that every row and every column that's not already filled must have a color that doesn't conflict with the existing ones.

Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose a row is empty. If I try to add a chip to that row, it has to be of a color that all the other cells in that row would also have that color. But since the row is empty, maybe any color is allowed, as long as the columns they're placed in don't conflict. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as each row being either all white, all black, or empty, and each column being either all white, all black, or empty. But the problem is that if a row is white, then all the columns that have a white chip in that row must also be white. But wait, no, because a column could have a mix, but no, the condition says all chips in a column must be the same color. So, if a row is white, then all the columns that have a white chip in that
