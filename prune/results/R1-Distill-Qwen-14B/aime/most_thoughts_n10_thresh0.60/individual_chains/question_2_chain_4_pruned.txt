Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway to 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit more than halfway to sqrt(3). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So PQ is a line segment from some point (p,0) to (0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1. That makes sense.

We need to find a unique point C on AB, not equal to A or B, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from F besides AB itself. Then, we have to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p+q.

First, let's visualize this. Points A and B are given, so AB is a line segment connecting them. The family F consists of all unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. So each PQ in F is a line from (p,0) to (0,q) with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1 because the length is 1.

Wait, no, the length of PQ is 1. So if P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), then the distance between P and Q is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1. So p² + q² = 1. Therefore, each segment PQ in F is a line from (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² = 1.

So the family F is all such segments where p and q satisfy that equation.

Now, AB is one of these segments, right? Let me check. Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's see if the distance between A and B is 1.

Distance AB = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is part of the family F, so AB is in F.

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So C is on AB, and for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So C is a point on AB such that it's only on AB and none of the other segments from F. So we need to find such a point C, and then compute OC².

Hmm. So how do we approach this?

I think we can parametrize AB and then find conditions where C doesn't lie on any other segment from F.

First, let's parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be described parametrically. Let's say the parameter t goes from 0 to 1, where t=0 is at A and t=1 is at B.

So the parametric equations would be:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)

y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So for any t between 0 and 1, that gives a point on AB.

So point C will be ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1, but t not 0 or 1.

Now, we need to ensure that C doesn't lie on any other segment PQ from F, except AB.

So suppose there's another segment PQ in F, different from AB, such that C lies on PQ. We need to find the point C on AB such that this doesn't happen, except for AB.

Wait, but how can we ensure that C is not on any other PQ in F?

Perhaps the point C is such that it's the only point on AB that can't be expressed as the intersection point of AB with any other PQ in F. So maybe C is the point where AB is the only segment from F that passes through it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope formed by the family F.

Wait, I'm not sure
