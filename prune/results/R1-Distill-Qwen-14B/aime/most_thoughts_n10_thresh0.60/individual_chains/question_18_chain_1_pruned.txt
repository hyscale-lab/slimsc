Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there are symmetries that can help in counting such shapes.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and internal angles of 150 degrees each. Since it's regular, it's also convex, so all the vertices point outward, and no sides cross each other.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. Rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, for a rectangle to be formed inside the dodecagon, its sides must align with either the sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals.

I think the key here is to figure out how to select four points (vertices) of the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. But wait, not all four points will necessarily be the vertices of the dodecagon. Because the sides of the rectangle can be diagonals of the dodecagon, the vertices of the rectangle might not coincide with the dodecagon's vertices. However, in this problem, it's specified that each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, no, that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again. The sides of the rectangle lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the rectangle's edges must coincide with these lines. That means the rectangle is formed by four lines, each of which is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the rectangle is a figure whose edges are along these lines, but the rectangle's vertices may not coincide with the dodecagon's vertices.

Wait, that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is such that each of its four sides is a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the rectangle is formed by four lines, each of which is either a side or a diagonal of the
