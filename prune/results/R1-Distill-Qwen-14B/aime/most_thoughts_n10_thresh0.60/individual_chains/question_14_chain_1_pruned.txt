Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 9999 and 1000. But since we're looking for the greatest such number, I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means, if I change the thousands digit to 1, the number is divisible by 7. Similarly, changing the hundreds, tens, or units digit to 1 should also result in a number divisible by 7.

So, for N = ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits), changing each digit to 1 one by one gives me four new numbers: 1BCD, A1CD, AB1D, ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Wait, but N itself doesn't necessarily have to be divisible by 7. It's the numbers formed by changing any single digit to 1 that have to be divisible by 7.

So, my approach should be: for each four-digit number starting from 9999 downwards, check if changing each digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. If all four such numbers are divisible by 7, then that's our N.

But checking each number one by one seems time-consuming. Maybe I can find a smarter way to construct N.

Let me think about the implications of the condition. For each digit position, changing it to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. So, N has four different constraints, each corresponding to one digit position.

Let me denote N as:

N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D

When I change the thousands digit to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Let's call this number N1.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit to 1 gives N2: 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D.

Changing the tens digit to 1: N3 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D.

Changing the units digit to 1: N4 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C +1.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, for N1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly for the others.

I can write these as congruence relations.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

7*142 = 994. So, 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 divided by 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 3, so 10 ≡3 mod7.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, N1: 6 + 2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

N2: 1000*A + 100 +10C + D ≡0 mod7.

Which is: 6A + 2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

N3: 1000*A + 100*B +10*1 + D ≡0 mod7.

Which is:6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

N4: 1000*A +100*B +10*C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Which is:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, now I have four congruence relations:

1) 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

2) 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3) 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

4) 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, so four equations, each mod7.

Let me write them as:

Equation1: 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod7.

Equation2: 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7.

Equation3: 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7.

Equation4: 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7.

Wait, that's a system of four equations with four variables (A,B,C,D), but since A,B,C,D are digits (0-9, with A≠0), I need to find digits that satisfy all four equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let me see:

From Equation1: 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1).

From Equation2: 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7 (since -2 mod7 is 5).

Subtract Equation1 from Equation2:

(6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) ≡5 -1 mod7.

So, 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as 2*(3A - B) ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

So, 3A - B ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation5.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation1 from Equation3:

Equation3:6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7 (since -3 mod7 is 4).

Equation1:2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Subtract Equation1 from Equation3:

(6A +2B + D) - (2B +3C + D) ≡4 -1 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3: 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

So, 2A - C ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation6.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation3 from Equation4.

Equation4:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6).

Equation3:6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

Subtract Equation3 from Equation4:

(6A +2B +3C) - (6A +2B + D) ≡6 -4 mod7.

Simplify: 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation7.

Now, let's see what we have.

Equation5: 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Equation6: 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Equation7:3C - D ≡2 mod7.

And Equation1:2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Let me express B, C, D in terms of A.

From Equation5: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

But since B is a digit (0-9), B = (3A -2) mod7.

Similarly, from Equation6: C ≡2A -1 mod7.

Since C is a digit, C = (2A -1) mod7.

From Equation7: D ≡3C -2 mod7.

But C is expressed in terms of A, so D = (3*(2A -1) -2) mod7.

Wait, let's compute that.

3*(2A -1) =6A -3.

So, D ≡ (6A -3 -2) mod7 = (6A -5) mod7.

So, D = (6A -5) mod7.

But since D is a digit, D is between 0 and 9.

So, now, let's express B, C, D in terms of A:

B = (3A -2) mod7.

C = (2A -1) mod7.

D = (6A -5) mod7.

But A is from 1 to 9 (since it's the thousands digit of a four-digit number, so A can't be 0).

So, A can be 1,2,...,9.

But we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, so we should start checking A from 9 downwards.

Let me create a table for A from 9 to 1, compute B, C, D modulo7, and then see if the digits are valid (0-9) and whether the resulting number N=ABCD satisfies all four equations and that all four modified numbers are divisible by 7.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute A such that when I compute B, C, D, they are digits (0-9), and then verify whether N1, N2, N3, N4 are divisible by 7.

Wait, but since I already derived B, C, D in terms of A using the congruence relations, maybe the equations are satisfied automatically, but I need to check whether
