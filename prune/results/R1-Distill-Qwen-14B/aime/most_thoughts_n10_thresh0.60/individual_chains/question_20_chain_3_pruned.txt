Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a 5x5 grid, which is 25 cells in total. We need to place some combination of white and black chips in these cells under certain conditions.

The conditions are:
1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for each column.
3. The placement must be maximal, meaning we can't add any more chips without violating the first two conditions.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but we don't have to use all of them; we can use some of each.

Hmm, okay, so let me break this down. Each row must be entirely one color or the other, and the same for each column. But wait, that might not necessarily be the case. Wait, the condition says that all chips in the same row have the same color. So if a row has chips, they're all the same color. But a row could have no chips, right? So a row can be entirely empty, or all chips in it are white or all are black.

Similarly, each column must have all its chips of the same color. So, a column could be empty, all white, or all black.

Wait, but there's another condition: any additional chip placed would violate the previous conditions. So, the current configuration must be such that every empty cell is in a row and a column that are both already filled with chips of some color. Because if I tried to place a chip in an empty cell, either its row or column would already have chips, which are of a different color, which would violate condition 2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose a cell is empty. If I place a chip there, it would have to be the same color as all other chips in that row and that column. But if the row already has some chips, they are all the same color. Similarly, the column has some chips, all the same color. So, for the empty cell, the color of the chip we place must match both the color of its row and the color of its column. But if the row and column have different colors, we can't place a chip there because it would have to be both colors, which isn't possible. So, in order to have a maximal configuration, every empty cell must be in a row and column that are either both empty or both have the same color.

Wait, no. Wait, if a row is all white and a column is all black, then the cell at their intersection can't have a chip because it can't be both white and black. So, in that case, that cell must remain empty. But for the configuration to be maximal, every empty cell must be such that at least one of the row or column is already filled, and the other is filled with a conflicting color, so that you can't add any more.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to model this as each row and column being either white, black, or empty, but with some constraints.

Wait, no. Actually, each row can either be white, black,
