Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. I'm given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, and I need to find AP, which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I have to find m + n.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. There's triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Then, the tangents at B and C meet at D. Since tangents from a common external point are equal, DB should be equal to DC. So D is the ex-pole or something related to BC.

AD is drawn and it intersects ω again at P. So AP is a segment from A through D, intersecting the circle again. I need to find the length of AP.

I remember that when dealing with points outside a circle and tangents, power of a point is often useful. Maybe I can use power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D would be DB^2, since DB is tangent to ω at B. Similarly, DC^2 is also the power, but since DB = DC, that's consistent.

So Power of D: DB^2 = DC^2 = DP * DA. Wait, no. Wait, hold on. The power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2, and since AD passes through the circle at A and P, the power is also equal to DA * DP. So, DB^2 = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA, wait, no, AP is the segment from A to P, which is along AD. So from A, going through D to P. So AP is actually longer than AD, right? Wait, no, wait. If A is on the circle, and AD is a secant, then A is on ω, so AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects ω again at P. So AP is the entire length from A to P, which is AD plus DP. But wait, actually, P is the second intersection point, so AP is the length from A to P, which is the same as AD plus DP? Or is it?

Wait, no. Let me think: If AD is a line from A through D, which is outside the circle. So the points are A, then D is outside, then P is the other intersection. So AP is from A to P, which is the same as AD extended beyond D to P. So AP is the length from A to P, and AD is the length from A to D. Therefore, AP = AD + DP, but I think I might be mixing up the terms. Alternatively, the Power of a Point formula says
