Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon, ABCDEF. All the opposite sides are parallel. Interesting. So, first off, an equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length, right? So, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA. But it's not necessarily regular because the angles can vary. However, in this case, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which adds more structure.

The problem also mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably something like a regular hexagon but perhaps stretched or compressed in some directions. But the key here is the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, these three lines form a triangle with given side lengths.

I remember something about similar triangles and perhaps using properties of parallel lines. Since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon and are parallel to their opposites, maybe the triangle formed by their extensions relates to the hexagon's dimensions.

Let me think about how the triangle is formed. When you extend AB, CD, and EF, each pair of these lines (since they are parallel to their opposites) will intersect to form a triangle. So, AB is extended beyond B and A, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F. Their intersections will form the vertices of the triangle.

Since the triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300, perhaps I can use the properties of similar triangles here. Maybe the hexagon is similar to this larger triangle but scaled down.

Wait, but the hexagon is equilateral. So, all its sides are equal, but the triangle is scalene with sides of different lengths. So, maybe the triangle is an affine transformation of the hexagon's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using coordinate geometry. Let me try assigning coordinates to the hexagon.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since the hexagon is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, maybe I can model it as a parallelogon, which is a polygon with opposite sides equal and parallel.

In a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it can be thought of as a centrally symmetric hexagon. That is, for each vertex, there's another vertex such that the center is the midpoint of the line connecting them. So, A and D, B and E, C and F are opposite vertices.

Wait, if that's the case, then the hexagon can be considered as three pairs of equal and parallel sides. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA.

But in this problem, the triangle is formed by extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, AB, CD, and EF are being extended to form a triangle. Since AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA, but here we're dealing with AB, CD, and EF.

Wait, perhaps
