Alright, so I've got this problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to break it down and figure out what's going on. 

Okay, every morning Aya walks 9 kilometers. She goes at a constant speed, s km per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, but that includes t minutes she spends in a coffee shop. Then, when she walks faster, at s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes the same t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they want to know how long the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, so the main thing here is to find the time it takes at s + 1/2 km/h, but to do that, I probably need to find the values of s and t first. Because the time includes the coffee shop time, which is the same in both scenarios, so maybe I can set up equations to solve for s and t.

Let me think about the first scenario: walking at s km/h. The total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time and coffee time. So, the walking time alone would be 4 hours minus t minutes. But wait, t is in minutes, and the walking time is in hours. I should convert t to hours to keep the units consistent.

So, t minutes is t/60 hours. Therefore, the walking time is (4 - t/60) hours. 

Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, the walking distance is s * (4 - t/60). But wait, the distance is given as 9 km. So, I can write that as:

s * (4 - t/60) = 9  … (Equation 1)

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours total. Again, the coffee shop time is t minutes, so in hours, that's t/60.

Thus, the walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours. So, the distance walked is (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60). And that's also 9 km. So:

(s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60) = 9  … (Equation 2)

Now, I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these simultaneously to find s and t.

Let me write both equations again:

1) s*(4 - t/60) = 9
2) (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60) = 9

Hmm, maybe I can express both equations in terms of s and t. Let me expand both equations.

Starting with Equation 1:

s*(4 - t/60) = 9
=> 4s - (s*t)/60 = 9  … (Equation 1a)

Equation 2:

(s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60) = 9
Expanding this, multiply each term:

s*(2.4 - t/60) + 2*(2.4 - t/60) = 9
=> 2.4s - (s*t)/60 + 4.8 - (2t)/60 = 9
Simplify:

2.4s - (s t)/60 + 4.8 - (t)/30 = 9

Let me write this as:

2.4s - (s t)/60 - (t)/30 + 4.8 = 9  … (Equation 2a)

Now, I have Equation 1a and Equation 2a. 

Equation 1a: 4s - (s t)/60 = 9
Equation 2a: 2.4s - (s t)/60 - (t)/30 + 4.8 = 9

Hmm, maybe I can subtract Equation 1a from Equation 2a to eliminate the (s t)/60 term. Let me try that.

Equation 2a - Equation 1a:

(2.4s - (s t)/60 - (t)/30 + 4.8) - (4s - (s t)/60) = 9 - 9

Simplify term by term:

2.4s - (s t)/60 - (t)/30 + 4.8 - 4s + (s t)/60 = 0

Now, let's cancel terms:

- (s t)/60 + (s t)/60 = 0, so those cancel.

So, 2.4s - 4s - (t)/30 + 4.8 = 0

Compute 2.4s - 4s: that's -1.6s

So, -1.6s - (t)/30 + 4.8 = 0

Let me rewrite this:

-1.6s - (t)/30 = -4.8

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it positive:

1.6s + (t)/30 = 4.8  … (Equation 3)

Now, Equation 3 is 1.6s + t/30 = 4.8

I need another equation to solve for s and t. Let's go back to Equation 1a.

Equation 1a: 4s - (s t)/60 = 9

I can write this as:

4s - (s t)/60 = 9

Hmm, perhaps I can express t from Equation 3 and substitute into Equation 1a.

From Equation 3:

1.6s + t/30 = 4.8

Let me solve for t:

t/30 = 4.8 - 1.6s

Multiply both sides by 30:

t = 30*(4.8 - 1.6s)
t = 144 - 48s

Wait, 30 * 4.8 is 144, since 4.8 *
