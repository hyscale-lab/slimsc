Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of this circle to the axis is 6. So, when you revolve it, the torus will have two main measurements: the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle itself). So here, major radius R is 6, minor radius r is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside or the outside of this sphere. When it's inside, they're tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o, expressed as a reduced fraction, and then to find m + n where the fraction is m/n.

Hmm. So I need to find r_i and r_o first. How do I approach this?

I remember that when two surfaces are tangent, their centers and the point of tangency lie along the same line. Since both the torus and the sphere are surfaces of revolution, their cross-sections in a plane containing the axis of revolution should be helpful.

Let me think about the cross-sectional view. In this plane, the torus would appear as two circles (the cross-section of the donut), each with radius 3, centered at a distance of 6 from the axis. The sphere, when cut through its center, would appear as a circle with radius 11.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the sphere's center is somewhere, and the torus is just touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, touching along another circle.

Wait, perhaps I should model this in 2D first. Let's imagine the cross-sectional view. The torus would look like two circles of radius 3, centered at (6,0) and (-6,0), assuming the axis is the y-axis. But actually, wait, the major radius is 6, so the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the axis. So maybe the cross-section is just one circle of radius 3, centered at (6,0), and when revolved, it forms the torus.

Wait, no. The cross-section of the torus is actually a circle of radius 3, whose center moves along a circle of radius 6 around the origin. So in cross-section, it's a circle (the generating circle) moving along a circular path. So in 2D, the cross-section of the torus is that moving circle.

But when looking at the cross-section in the plane of the axis, it's a circle of radius 3, centered at (6,0). So when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's cross-section is a circle of radius 11, and the torus is tangent to it.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this in 3D. Let's consider the center of the sphere. When the torus is inside, the sphere's center is at some point, and the closest point on the torus must touch the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, touching at a point.

Wait, but the problem says the torus is tangent along a circle, not just a point. So it's tangent along a circle. So the surface of the torus and the sphere meet along a circle in space.

Let me think about the geometry. The torus is symmetric, so the circle of tangency must lie in a plane equidistant from the axis of the torus. Similarly for
