Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and diagonals that bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, wait. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.

So, the rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, the coordinates of A and C must be negatives of each other, same with B and D.

Wait, so if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-
