Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the functions f(x) and g(x). The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So, these are absolute value functions with some modifications. Maybe I should sketch these functions to visualize them.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner absolute value |x| makes a V-shape graph. Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 0.5 units. Taking the absolute value again would reflect any negative parts back upwards. So, f(x) will have a W-shape? Wait, let me think. When |x| is less than 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so the outer absolute value would make it 1/2 - |x|. When |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, it remains |x| - 1/2. So, the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that starts at (0, 1/2), goes down to (1/2, 0) and up again. Wait, no, actually, it's more like two Vs. Because when x is positive, it's the same as when x is negative due to the absolute value. So, it's symmetric about the y-axis.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. By the same logic, this function will have a similar shape but shifted less. So, at x = 0, it's 1/4, then it decreases to x = 1/4 where it reaches 0, and then increases again. So, both f and g are piecewise linear functions, symmetric about the y-axis.

Now, the functions we're dealing with are compositions of these: 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's denote h(x) = f(sin(2πx)) and then k(x) = 4g(h(x)). Similarly, for the other equation, we have x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), which would involve substituting y into f, then into g, scaling by 4.

Wait, but the second equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, it's an equation where x is expressed in terms of y, which is a bit tricky because usually, we have equations in terms of x or y. Hmm.

But since both equations are in terms of x and y, perhaps I can find the number of solutions by analyzing their periods and how they intersect.

Let me try to figure out the periods of these functions. For the first function, y =
