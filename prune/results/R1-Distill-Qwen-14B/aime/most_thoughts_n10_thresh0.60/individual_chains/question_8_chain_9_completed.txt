Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's break it down.

Alright, the first equation is a linear one: a + b + c = 300. That's straightforward. The second one is more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. I think I can factor this expression somehow to make it more manageable.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of a square of one variable and another variable. So, for example, a²b and a²c both have a². Similarly for the others. Maybe I can factor out a, b, or c from these terms.

Let me try factoring a from the first two terms: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So, the entire second equation can be rewritten as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's better. Now, I also remember that a + b + c = 300, which might help. Let's denote S = a + b + c = 300. Then, b + c = S - a, a + c = S - b, and a + b = S - c. So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(S - a) + b²(S - b) + c²(S - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that out:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Expanding each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay, so now I have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the known sum a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be written as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Let me verify that formula.

Yes, the identity is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, from that, I can express a³ + b³ + c³ as:

300^3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Let me compute 300^3 first. 300^3 is 27,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Now, going back to the equation I had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expression for a³ + b³ + c³:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

300(a² + b² + c²) - 27,000,000 + 900*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Now, bring the 27,000,000 to the other side:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me see if I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)^2 and ab + bc + ca.

Yes, I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Substituting this into our equation:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) + 900*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Let me compute 300*90,000 first. That's 27,000,000. Then, 300*(-2(ab + bc + ca)) is -600(ab + bc + ca).

So, putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Combine like terms for ab + bc + ca:

(-600 + 900)(ab + bc + ca) = 300(ab + bc + ca).

So now, equation is:

27,000,000 + 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Subtract 27,000,000 from both sides:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out 3 from the left side:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now we have:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write that as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but perhaps we can factor this expression.

Alternatively, let's denote x = ab + bc + ca and y = abc. Then, the equation becomes:

100x - y = 2,000,000 --> y = 100x - 2,000,000.

So, now, we have y = 100x - 2e6.

But we also know from the first equation that a + b + c = 300, which relates to the elementary symmetric sums.

So, the elementary symmetric sums for three variables are:

s1 = a + b + c = 300,

s2 = ab + bc + ca = x,

s3 = abc = y.

So, we have y = 100x - 2,000,000.

So, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is:

t^3 - s1 t^2 + s2 t - s3 = 0,

which is:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + x t - y = 0.

But since y = 100x - 2,000,000, we can substitute:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + x t - (100x - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + x t - 100x + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps we can factor this somehow.

Wait, let me factor terms with x:

x(t - 100) + (t^3 - 300 t^2 + 2,000,000) = 0.

So, x(t - 100) = - (t^3 - 300 t^2 + 2,000,000).

Hmm, but x is a symmetric sum, so it's equal for all variables. Maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me rearrange this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps factor out ab, bc, etc. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can divide both sides by abc to make it in terms of reciprocals.

Wait, but if I do that, I get:

1/(c) + 1/(a) + 1/(b) - 100(1/(abc)) = -2,000,000 / abc.

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps set variables in terms of each other.

Wait, another idea: Maybe assume that two variables are equal? Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps there are solutions where a = b, or a = c, etc.

But let's think if considering a = b = c could help, though I doubt it because 300/3=100, so each would be 100. Let's check that case.

If a = b = c = 100, then let's compute the second equation.

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6*(100^2 *100) = 6*(1,000,000) = 6,000,000.

Oh! So that works. So (100, 100, 100) is a solution. So, that's one triple.

But are there others?

Wait, let's see. Suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Then, perhaps I can express everything in terms of a and c.

Given that a + a + c = 300, so 2a + c = 300. So c = 300 - 2a.

Similarly, let's plug into the second equation.

Original second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Since a = b, this becomes:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c² = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2:

a³ + a²c + a c² = 3,000,000.

Factor out a:

a(a² + a c + c²) = 3,000,000.

But since c = 300 - 2a, let's substitute:

a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2] = 3,000,000.

Let me compute the terms inside the brackets:

First term: a².

Second term: a*(300 - 2a) = 300a - 2a².

Third term: (300 - 2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1200a + 4a².

Adding all these together:

a² + (300a - 2a²) + (90,000 - 1200a + 4a²) =

Combine like terms:

a² - 2a² + 4a² = 3a².

300a - 1200a = -900a.

Constants: 90,000.

So altogether: 3a² - 900a + 90,000.

So the equation becomes:

a*(3a² - 900a + 90,000) = 3,000,000.

Factor out 3 from the polynomial inside:

a * 3(a² - 300a + 30,000) = 3,000,000.

So, 3a(a² - 300a + 30,000) = 3,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

a(a² - 300a + 30,000) = 1,000,000.

So, now we have:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's a cubic equation in a. Let's see if it's factorable.

Let me try possible integer roots. The possible roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, which are 1. So, possible roots: ±1, ±2, ..., up to ±1,000,000. But considering that a is a nonnegative integer, and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, so a can be up to 150.

So, let's test a=100: 100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1e6.

Compute each term:

100³ = 1,000,000.

300*(100)^2 = 300*10,000 = 3,000,000.

30,000*100 = 3,000,000.

So,

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.

So a=100 is a root. Great. So, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Let me perform synthetic division for a=100:

Coefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000.

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 100: 1*100 = 100.

Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.

Multiply by 100: -200*100 = -20,000.

Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000.

Multiply by 100: 10,000*100 = 1,000,000.

Add to last coefficient: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0. Perfect.

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0.

So, the other roots are solutions to a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0.

Let's compute discriminant D = 200² - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.

So, a double root at a = [200 ± 0]/2 = 100.

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^2(a - 100) = (a - 100)^3. Wait, but that would be if the quadratic was (a - 100)^2, which it is.

Wait, actually, the quadratic is a² - 200a + 10,000 = (a - 100)^2.

So, the cubic is (a - 100)^3 = 0, so the only root is a=100, with multiplicity 3.

But wait, in our case, for the equation a(a² - 300a + 30,000) = 1,000,000, we found that the only solution is a=100. So, when a=100, c=300 - 2*100 = 100. So, this is the case where a = b = c = 100, which we already knew.

So, in the case where a = b, the only solution is a = b = c = 100. So, that gives us one triple.

But maybe there are other cases where two variables are equal, but the third is different, but I don't know yet. Alternatively, perhaps the only solution is when all three are equal.

Wait, but maybe I should test another case. Let's say a ≠ b ≠ c. Hmm, that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the given equation is symmetric and perhaps the only solution is when a, b, c are all equal. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

We can factor this as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, earlier, I had written it as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Since a + b + c = 300, as before, so b + c = 300 - a, etc.

So, another way to write the second equation is:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Which is the same as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Wait, but earlier I tried to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of symmetric sums, but perhaps I can find another relation.

Wait, from the first equation, a + b + c = 300.

Let me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300,

S2 = ab + bc + ca,

S3 = abc.

So, as before, a³ + b³ + c³ = S1³ - 3 S1 S2 + 3 S3.

So, substituting into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [S1³ - 3 S1 S2 + 3 S3] = 6,000,000.

But a² + b² + c² = S1² - 2 S2.

So, substituting all in:

300(S1² - 2 S2) - [S1³ - 3 S1 S2 + 3 S3] = 6,000,000.

Compute this:

300*(300² - 2 S2) - [300³ - 3*300*S2 + 3 S3] = 6e6.

Calculate 300*300²: 300^3 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2 S2) = -600 S2.

So, the first part is 27,000,000 - 600 S2.

The second part is -[27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3].

Which is -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3 S3.

Putting them together:

27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

(27e6 -27e6) + (-600 S2 + 900 S2) -3 S3 =6e6.

Which becomes:

300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

Which brings us back to the earlier equation: S3 = 100 S2 - 2e6.

So, S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

So, now, we have S1 = 300, S3 = 100 S2 - 2e6.

So, the monic cubic with roots a, b, c is:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 t - (100 S2 - 2e6) = 0.

Which can be written as:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 t - 100 S2 + 2e6 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor S2:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 (t - 100) + 2e6 = 0.

Not sure how helpful that is, but maybe we can think about S2.

Note that S2 is ab + bc + ca.

But S2 must be an integer because a, b, c are integers.

Similarly, S3 is 100 S2 - 2e6, which must also be an integer.

So, S3 must be non-negative because a, b, c are non-negative integers, so their product is non-negative.

Thus, 100 S2 - 2e6 ≥ 0 → S2 ≥ 20,000.

So, S2 ≥ 20,000.

But what is the maximum possible value of S2?

Since a + b + c = 300, the maximum of ab + bc + ca occurs when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible. For non-negative integers, the maximum occurs when one variable is 0, and the other two sum to 300, so say a=0, b + c=300. Then, ab + bc + ca = 0 + bc + 0 = bc. The maximum bc when b + c =300 is (150)^2=22,500. So, maximum S2 is 22,500.

Wait, but wait, actually, if all three variables are equal, S2 would be 3*(100)^2 = 30,000. Wait, no, wait, no, S2 is ab + bc + ca. If a = b = c =100, then ab + bc + ca = 3*(100*100)=30,000. So, that's higher than 22,500. Hmm, so maybe the maximum is 30,000.

Wait, but in the case where all variables are equal, S2 is 30,000. If we take a=150, b=150, c=0, then S2=150*150 +150*0 +0*150=22,500. So, yes, 30,000 is larger. So, the maximum S2 is 30,000 when a=b=c=100.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when variables are equal, S2 is 3*(a^2). Since a =100, S2=3*(100)^2=30,000.

So, S2 ranges from 0 (if two variables are 0 and the third is 300) up to 30,000.

Wait, but in our case, S2 must be ≥ 20,000 because S3 =100 S2 - 2e6 ≥ 0 → 100 S2 ≥ 2e6 → S2 ≥ 20,000.

So, S2 is between 20,000 and 30,000.

Hmm.

So, S2 ∈ [20,000, 30,000].

Given that, S2 must be an integer in that range.

So, we have S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

So, S3 must be non-negative, which it is because S2 ≥20,000.

Now, considering that, perhaps we can parameterize variables.

Let me think: How can I relate S2 and S3 to a, b, c?

Since we have a cubic equation with roots a, b, c, given by t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 t - S3 =0, where S3 =100 S2 -2e6.

So, t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 t - (100 S2 -2e6) =0.

Let me write that as:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 t -100 S2 + 2e6=0.

Hmm, perhaps factor S2:

t^3 -300 t^2 + S2 (t -100) + 2e6=0.

But I don't see a clear way to factor this.

Alternatively, perhaps make a substitution: Let u = t - 100.

So, t = u + 100.

Substitute into the equation:

(u + 100)^3 - 300 (u + 100)^2 + S2 (u + 100) - 100 S2 + 2e6=0.

Let me expand each term:

First term: (u + 100)^3 = u³ + 300 u² + 30,000 u + 1,000,000.

Second term: 300*(u + 100)^2 = 300*(u² + 200u + 10,000) = 300 u² + 60,000 u + 3,000,000.

Third term: S2*(u + 100) = S2 u + 100 S2.

Fourth term: -100 S2.

Fifth term: +2e6.

Putting all together:

(u³ + 300u² + 30,000u + 1e6) - (300u² + 60,000u +3e6) + (S2 u + 100 S2) -100 S2 + 2e6 = 0.

Let me distribute the negative sign on the second term:

u³ + 300u² + 30,000u +1e6 -300u² -60,000u -3e6 + S2 u +100 S2 -100 S2 +2e6 =0.

Simplify term by term:

u³: u³.

300u² -300u² = 0.

30,000u -60,000u = -30,000u.

1e6 -3e6 +2e6 = 0.

S2 u: S2 u.

100 S2 -100 S2 =0.

So, the equation becomes:

u³ -30,000u + S2 u =0.

Factor out u:

u(u² -30,000 + S2) =0.

So, either u=0 or u² = 30,000 - S2.

But u= t -100, so u=0 implies t=100, which is the case where a=b=c=100, which we already considered.

The other solutions are when u² = 30,000 - S2.

So, u² =30,000 - S2.

But u is an integer because t is an integer (as a, b, c are integers), so 30,000 - S2 must be a perfect square.

Let me denote D = 30,000 - S2.

So, D must be a perfect square, and D = u².

Thus, D =k², where k is a non-negative integer.

So, S2 =30,000 -k².

But earlier, we had S2 ≥20,000. So,

30,000 -k² ≥20,000 →k² ≤10,000 →k ≤100.

Also, since S2 is non-negative, 30,000 -k² ≥0 →k² ≤30,000 →k ≤sqrt(30,000) ≈173.2. So, k can be from 0 to 100.

So, k is in 0,1,2,...,100.

Thus, for each such k, we have S2 =30,000 -k².

So, for each k, S3 =100 S2 -2e6 =100*(30,000 -k²) -2e6=3e6 -100k² -2e6= 1e6 -100k².

So, S3 =1e6 -100k².

But S3 must be non-negative, as it's the product of non-negative integers. So,

1e6 -100k² ≥0 →100k² ≤1e6 →k² ≤10,000 →k ≤100.

Which we already have.

So, now, for each k from 0 to100, we can define S2 and S3 as above, and then the cubic equation will factor accordingly.

But we need to find the number of triples (a,b,c) such that a + b +c=300 and ab + bc + ca = S2, and abc=S3.

But from the substitution earlier, we have that the roots are t=100, and t=100 ±k.

So, the roots are 100, 100 +k, 100 -k.

But wait, in the substitution, u = t -100, so u= ±k.

Thus, t=100 +k and t=100 -k.

So, the three roots are 100, 100 +k, 100 -k.

But a, b, c are non-negative integers, so we need 100 +k, 100 -k, and 100 to be non-negative.

So, 100 -k ≥0 →k ≤100. Which we already have.

So, the roots are 100, 100 +k, 100 -k, where k is an integer from 0 to100.

But wait, some of these roots might be equal.

For example, when k=0, all roots are 100, giving the triple (100,100,100).

For k=1, the roots are 100,101,99.

Similarly, for k=2, roots are 100,102,98.

And so on.

So, for each k from 0 to100, we have a triple where the numbers are 100 +k, 100 -k, and 100.

But wait, are all these triples distinct? Or are some of them permutations of each other?

For example, when k=1, the triple is (101,99,100). But when k=99, the triple would be (199, 1,100). Similarly, when k=50, the triple is (150,50,100). So, each k from 0 to100 gives a unique set of numbers, but considering permutations, each triple is counted multiple times depending on the symmetry.

Wait, but the problem counts triples (a,b,c) as ordered triples, right? Because it's asking for triples of nonnegative integers. So, the order matters.

Wait, but in our approach, for each k, we have a specific set of numbers {100 -k,100,100 +k}, and the number of ordered triples would be the number of permutations of these three numbers.

But for k=0, all three numbers are 100, so there's only one ordered triple.

For k=1, the numbers are 99,100,101. These are all distinct, so the number of ordered triples is 6 (since 3! =6).

Similarly, for k=2, 98,100,102: 6 permutations.

But wait, when k is such that two numbers are equal, but in our case, for k>0, all three numbers are distinct because 100 +k, 100 -k, and 100 are all different when k≠0.

Wait, no, unless k=0, they are all same. For k>0, 100 +k and 100 -k are different, and both different from 100. So, for each k>0, we have three distinct numbers, giving 6 ordered triples.

Wait, but hold on: Let me double-check. Suppose k=50. Then, the numbers are 50,100,150. All distinct. So, 6 ordered triples.

Similarly, for k=1, numbers are 99,100,101: 6 ordered triples.

But wait, when k=100, we have 100 +100=200, 100 -100=0, and 100. So, numbers are 0,100,200. These are all distinct, so 6 ordered triples.

So, for each k from 1 to100, we have 6 ordered triples. For k=0, only 1 ordered triple.

So, total number of ordered triples would be 1 + 100*6 = 601.

Wait, that seems like a lot. But let me think: 100 values of k from 1 to100, each giving 6 ordered triples, plus 1 for k=0.

So, 601.

But wait, let me check if all these triples satisfy the original equations.

Let me take k=1, so numbers are 99,100,101.

Check a + b + c =99+100+101=300. Yes.

Now, compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Compute each term:

99²*100 +99²*101 +100²*99 +100²*101 +101²*99 +101²*100.

Compute each:

99²*100 = (9801)*100 =980,100.

99²*101 =9801*101= 989,901.

100²*99=10,000*99=990,000.

100²*101=10,000*101=1,010,000.

101²*99=10,201*99=1,009,899.

101²*100=10,201*100=1,020,100.

Now, add them all up:

980,100 + 989,901 =1,970,001.

1,970,001 +990,000=2,960,001.

2,960,001 +1,010,000=3,970,001.

3,970,001 +1,009,899=4,979,900.

4,979,900 +1,020,100=6,000,000.

Yes, it adds up. So, that works.

Similarly, for k=2, numbers 98,100,102.

Sum:98+100+102=300.

Compute a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

Compute each term:

98²*100 =9604*100=960,400.

98²*102=9604*102=9604*(100+2)=960,400 +19,208=979,608.

100²*98=10,000*98=980,000.

100²*102=10,000*102=1,020,000.

102²*98=10,404*98=1,019,592.

102²*100=10,404*100=1,040,400.

Add them up:

960,400 +979,608 =1,940,008.

1,940,008 +980,000=2,920,008.

2,920,008 +1,020,000=3,940,008.

3,940,008 +1,019,592=4,959,600.

4,959,600 +1,040,400=6,000,000.

Yes, that works too.

So, each k from1 to100 gives 6 ordered triples, and k=0 gives 1.

Thus, the total number of ordered triples is 1 + 100*6=601.

Wait, but hold on a second: For each k, the numbers are 100 -k,100,100 +k. But when k >100, 100 -k becomes negative. But since k goes up to 100, 100 -100=0, which is allowed.

But wait, when k=100, the numbers are 0,100,200. So, that's a valid triple.

So, each k from0 to100 gives a valid triple, and each such triple corresponds to 6 ordered triples unless the numbers are not all distinct.

Wait, but for k=0, all numbers are 100, so there's only one ordered triple.

For k=1 to100, all numbers are distinct, so each gives 6 ordered triples.

So, the total number is 1 + (100)*6=601.

But wait, let me think again: Are there other solutions besides these?

In the earlier approach, we assumed that two variables are equal, but found only the solution where all are equal.

But in this substitution, we've considered all possible k, leading to triples (100 -k,100,100 +k), which are all the possible triples where the numbers are symmetrically placed around 100, with a spread of 2k.

But are there any other triples where the numbers are not in this symmetric form?

Wait, for example, is there a solution where a, b, c are not of the form 100 -k, 100, 100 +k?

In other words, could there be triples where the numbers are not equally spaced around 100?

Hmm. Let's see.

Suppose that a, b, c are not symmetric in this way. For example, say a=150, b=150, c=0. Then, let's check if this satisfies the second equation.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

So, a=150, b=150, c=0.

Compute:

150²*150 +150²*0 +150²*150 +150²*0 +0²*150 +0²*150.

Which is:

(150^3)*2 + 0 +0 +0 +0 +0 = 2*(3,375,000) =6,750,000.

Which is more than 6,000,000. So, it doesn't satisfy the second equation.

Similarly, let's try a=200, b=100, c=0.

Compute the second equation:

200²*100 +200²*0 +100²*200 +100²*0 +0²*200 +0²*100.

=40,000*100 +0 +10,000*200 +0 +0 +0.

=4,000,000 + 2,000,000 =6,000,000.

Oh! So that works.

Wait, but according to our earlier parameterization, for k=100, we have numbers 0,100,200. So, that's exactly this case.

So, the triple (200,100,0) is one of the ordered triples we've already counted.

So, in that case, the approach captures this solution.

Similarly, let's try a=150, b=150, c=0: as before, this does not satisfy the second equation, so it's not a solution.

So, perhaps all the solutions are captured by the parameterization (100 -k,100,100 +k) for k from0 to100.

Wait, but when k=50, we have 50,100,150. Let me check another triple: a=50, b=150, c=100.

Compute the second equation:

50²*150 +50²*100 +150²*50 +150²*100 +100²*50 +100²*150.

Compute each term:

2500*150=375,000.

2500*100=250,000.

22500*50=1,125,000.

22500*100=2,250,000.

10000*50=500,000.

10000*150=1,500,000.

Sum them up:

375,000 +250,000=625,000.

625,000 +1,125,000=1,750,000.

1,750,000 +2,250,000=4,000,000.

4,000,000 +500,000=4,500,000.

4,500,000 +1,500,000=6,000,000.

Yes, that works. So, the triple (50,150,100) is a solution, and is included in our count.

Thus, seems like all possible solutions are captured by the parameterization.

So, for each k from0 to100, we have a unique set of numbers {100 -k,100,100 +k}, which can be arranged in 6 different ways (for k≠0) or 1 way (for k=0). So, the total number of ordered triples is 601.

But wait, let me confirm this. Let me think of another possible solution. Suppose a=110, b=100, c=90. Are these part of our parameterization?

Yes, because 100 -k=90 →k=10, and 100 +k=110. So, yes, this is included in our count.

So, it seems that all possible solutions are captured by this parameterization.

Therefore, the total number of ordered triples (a,b,c) is 601.

Wait, but the problem says "triples of nonnegative integers", which typically means ordered triples, so (a,b,c) is different from, say, (b,a,c) unless a=b.

So, our count of 601 includes all ordered triples, which is correct.

Thus, the answer should be 601.


The problem requires finding the number of ordered triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\).

First, we rewrite the second equation using symmetric sums:
\[
a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000.
\]
Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\) into the equation:
\[
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000.
\]
Using the identity \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc\), we substitute \(a + b + c = 300\) and simplify:
\[
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - \left(27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc\right) = 6,000,000.
\]
Simplifying further, we find:
\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]
Let \(S_2 = ab + bc + ca\) and \(S_3 = abc\). Then:
\[
100S_2 - S_3 = 2,000,000 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S_3 = 100S_2 - 2,000,000.
\]
We also know \(a + b + c = 300\), so the cubic polynomial with roots \(a, b, c\) is:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + S_2 t - S_3 = 0.
\]
Substituting \(S_3 = 100S_2 - 2,000,000\), we get:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + S_2 t - (100S_2 - 2,000,000) = 0.
\]
By analyzing the roots, we find that the solutions are of the form \(100 \pm k\) and \(100\), where \(k\) is an integer. For each \(k\) from 0 to 100, the roots are \(100 - k\), \(100\), and \(100 + k\). These roots yield ordered triples \((a, b, c)\).

For \(k = 0\), the only triple is \((100, 100, 100)\). For \(k = 1\) to \(100\), each \(k\) yields 6 distinct ordered triples due to permutations. Thus, the total number of ordered triples is:
\[
1 + 100 \times 6 = 601.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{601}
\]
