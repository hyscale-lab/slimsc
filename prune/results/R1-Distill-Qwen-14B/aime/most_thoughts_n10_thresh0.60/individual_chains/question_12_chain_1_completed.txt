Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid, and I need to figure out how many ways I can fill each cell with a digit so that two specific sums are satisfied. The problem gives an example grid, but I need to find the total number of valid arrangements.

Let me break down the problem first. The grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. Each cell will contain a single digit (0-9). The conditions are:

1. When reading the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999.
2. When reading the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99.

The example given is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

In this case, reading left to right gives two numbers: 008 and 991. Adding them gives 8 + 991 = 999. Reading top to bottom gives the numbers 09, 09, and 81. Adding those gives 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. So this arrangement is valid.

So, my goal is to figure out all such possible grids. Let me try to model this.

First, let me label the cells in the grid for clarity. Let's denote the cells as follows:

Top row: A, B, C  
Bottom row: D, E, F

So the grid looks like:

A B C  
D E F

Now, when reading left to right, the two numbers are:

- First number: A B C (which is 100*A + 10*B + C)
- Second number: D E F (which is 100*D + 10*E + F)

Their sum should be 999.

So, equation 1: (100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999.

Simplify this equation:

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Which can be rewritten as:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Now, 999 is a 3-digit number. Let me think about how to break this down.

Each digit place (hundreds, tens, ones) should add up appropriately, considering possible carry-over from the lower digits.

Let me denote the following:

Let’s define:

- S1 = A + D (hundreds place)
- S2 = B + E (tens place)
- S3 = C + F (ones place)

But we have to consider the carry-over from the one's place to the ten's place, and from ten's to hundred's place.

So, the equation becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

But S3 can be more than 10, so let me denote:

Let’s define carry-over variables:

- Let k1 be the carry-over from the ones place to the tens place. So, k1 = floor(S3 / 10).
- Similarly, let k2 be the carry-over from the tens place to the hundreds place. So, k2 = floor((S2 + k1) / 10).

Then, the equation becomes:

100*(S1 + k2) + 10*(S2 + k1 - 10*k2) + (S3 - 10*k1) = 999.

But 999 is 9*100 + 9*10 +9. So,

We can write:

S1 + k2 = 9  
(S2 + k1) mod 10 = 9  
(S3 - 10*k1) =9

Wait, let me rephrase:

The hundreds place: S1 + k2 = 9  
The tens place: (S2 + k1) mod 10 = 9  
The ones place: S3 - 10*k1 =9

So, that gives us three equations:

1. S1 + k2 = 9  
2. (S2 + k1) mod 10 =9  
3. S3 -10*k1 =9

But let's note that k1 can be 0 or 1 because S3 is the sum of two digits (C + F). Each digit is 0-9, so the maximum S3 can be is 18 (9+9). So, S3 can be at most 18, so k1 can be 0 or 1.

Similarly, k2 is the carry-over from the tens place, which is (S2 + k1) //10. Since S2 is the sum of two digits, each 0-9, so S2 can be 0-18, but with k1 added, the maximum S2 +k1 is 18 +1=19. So, k2 can be 0 or 1.

So, let's list possible cases based on k1 and k2.

We'll also have to consider the second condition about the top to bottom sum. Let me think about that next.

The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

Reading top to bottom, the numbers are:

- First column: A D (which is 10*A + D)
- Second column: B E (which is 10*B + E)
- Third column: C F (which is 10*C + F)

So, the sum is:

(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

Let me write this as:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Let me denote:

Sum of the first digits (top row) is S4 = A + B + C  
Sum of the second digits (bottom row) is S5 = D + E + F

So, 10*S4 + S5 = 99.

Which implies:

10*S4 + S5 = 99.

Let me rearrange:

10*S4 = 99 - S5

But S4 and S5 are sums of digits. So, S4 can be from 0-27 (since each of A, B, C is 0-9, summing to 27 max). But given that 10*S4 <=99, S4 can be from 0 to 9 because 10*9=90, and 99-9=90. Wait, let me think.

Wait, no: 10*S4 + S5 =99, and both S4 and S5 are sums of digits.

Each of A, B, C is a digit (0-9), so S4 = A + B + C can be 0-27. Similarly, S5 = D + E + F can be 0-27.

But 10*S4 + S5 =99.

Since 10*S4 is the main term, let's see possible S4:

If S4 = 9, then 10*9=90, so S5=9.

If S4=8, then 10*8=80, so S5=19.

If S4=7, 10*7=70, S5=29.

But S5 can't be 29 because the maximum sum of three digits is 27 (9+9+9). So S5=29 is impossible. Similarly, S4 can't be less than 7 because then S5 would be 99-70=29, which is too big. So S4 can be 9, 8, or 7.

Wait, let's check:

For 10*S4 + S5 =99,

If S4=9: 10*9=90 → S5=9.

If S4=8: 10*8=80 → S5=19.

If S4=7: 10*7=70 → S5=29 → which is impossible.

If S4=10: 10*10=100, which is more than 99, so that's not possible.

Wait, 10*S4 + S5=99, so S4 can be 9, 8, 7, but as S5 can't exceed 27, when S4=7, S5=29 is impossible. So S4 can be only 9 or 8.

Wait:

Wait, when S4=9: S5=9.

When S4=8: S5=19.

When S4=7: S5=29 → invalid.

So, possible (S4, S5) pairs are (9,9) and (8,19).

So, that's useful information.

Now, let's go back to the first condition.

From the first condition, we have:

100*(S1 +k2) +10*(S2 +k1 -10*k2) + (S3 -10*k1) =999.

But 999 is 9*100 +9*10 +9.

So:

- Hundreds place: S1 +k2 =9  
- Tens place: (S2 +k1) mod10 =9  
- Ones place: S3 -10*k1 =9.

So, let's write these as:

1. S1 +k2 =9  
2. (S2 +k1) ≡9 mod10  
3. S3 =9 +10*k1.

Also, we know that S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F.

Additionally, from the second condition, we have:

- S4 = A + B + C =9 or 8  
- S5 = D + E + F =9 or 19.

So, let's consider that.

Now, let's try to structure this problem by considering possible values of k1 and k2.

Since k1 can be 0 or 1, and k2 can be 0 or 1, we can have four possible cases:

Case 1: k1=0, k2=0  
Case 2: k1=0, k2=1  
Case 3: k1=1, k2=0  
Case 4: k1=1, k2=1

But let's see if all these are possible.

From equation 1: S1 +k2 =9. So S1 =9 -k2.

Since S1 = A + D, which are digits (0-9), so S1 can be from 0 to 18. But since A and D are single digits (0-9), S1 can be 0-18.

But S1 =9 -k2. Since k2 can be 0 or 1, S1 can be 9 or 8.

Wait, k2 is from equation 1, which is 0 or 1, so:

If k2=0: S1 =9  
If k2=1: S1=8  

So, S1 is either 9 or 8.

Similarly, equation 3: S3 =9 +10*k1.

Since k1 can be 0 or1,

If k1=0: S3=9  
If k1=1: S3=19

But S3 = C + F, each digit 0-9, so maximum S3 is 18 (9+9). So, if k1=1, S3=19 is impossible. So, k1 cannot be 1.

So, k1 can only be 0.

Therefore, k1=0, which implies:

From equation3: S3=9  
From equation2: (S2 +0) mod10=9 → S2 ≡9 mod10.

So, S2 can be 9 or 19. But S2 = B + E, each 0-9, so maximum S2=18. So S2 can be 9 or 19, but 19 is impossible. So S2=9.

So, k1=0, k2 can be 0 or1.

So, possible cases are:

Case 1: k1=0, k2=0 → S1=9, S2=9, S3=9  
Case 2: k1=0, k2=1 → S1=8, S2=9, S3=9

So, these are the only two possible cases.

Now, let's consider each case separately.

But also, from the second condition, we have either (S4=9, S5=9) or (S4=8, S5=19).

So, let's see how these interact.

Let me structure the problem:

We have two main cases based on k1 and k2.

Case 1: k1=0, k2=0  
So, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Additionally, from the second condition, either (S4=9, S5=9) or (S4=8, S5=19).

Case 2: k1=0, k2=1  
So, S1=8, S2=9, S3=9.

From the second condition, again either (S4=9, S5=9) or (S4=8, S5=19).

Wait, but in both cases, we need to satisfy both the sum conditions. So, perhaps we need to model this combining both constraints.

Let me consider each case.

Case 1: k1=0, k2=0  
So, S1 =9, S2=9, S3=9.

Which means:  
A + D =9  
B + E=9  
C + F=9

Also, from the second condition:  
Either S4=9 and S5=9, or S4=8 and S5=19.

So, S4= A + B + C  
S5= D + E + F

So, in this case, let's consider both possibilities.

Subcase 1a: S4=9, S5=9  
Subcase 1b: S4=8, S5=19

Let me handle Subcase 1a first.

Subcase 1a: S4=9, S5=9  
So, A + B + C=9  
D + E + F=9  
And we also have:  
A + D=9  
B + E=9  
C + F=9

Let me think about this.

We have:

A + D =9  
B + E=9  
C + F=9

Which means D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

Substituting into S5= D + E + F =9:

(9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) =9  
27 - (A + B + C) =9  
But A + B + C=9 (from S4=9). So,

27 -9=18=9? No, that's 18=9 which is impossible.

So Subcase 1a is impossible.

Subcase 1a cannot happen.

So, now Subcase 1b: S4=8, S5=19  
Which is:

A + B + C=8  
D + E + F=19

But since D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

So, substituting into S5= D + E + F:

(9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) =19  
27 - (A + B + C) =19  
But A + B + C=8, so 27 -8=19=19 → which holds.

So, Subcase 1b is possible.

So, in Case 1, only Subcase 1b is possible.

So, we have:

A + B + C=8  
D + E + F=19  
But D=9 -A, E=9 -B, F=9 -C.

So, let's now find the number of solutions to A + B + C=8, where A, B, C are digits (0-9), and D=9-A, E=9-B, F=9-C are digits (0-9). Since D, E, F must be digits, 9 - A, etc., must be between 0 and9. So, A, B, C can be from 0 to9, but since D, E, F=9 - A, etc., A, B, C can be from 0 to9, but 9 - A >=0 → A <=9, which is always true.

So, the only constraint is A, B, C are digits, and A + B + C=8.

We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, where each A, B, C is between 0 and9. Since 8 is less than 9*3, there are no upper constraints beyond the natural digit limit, so the number of solutions is C(8 + 3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45. But wait, that's for non-negative integers where each variable can be 0-8. But in our case, each variable can be up to 9, but the sum is only 8, so all solutions are valid because none of the variables can exceed 8. So, the number of solutions is indeed 45.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the sum is 8, and each variable can be 0-8, so yes, all solutions are valid.

So, 45 possible (A, B, C) combinations.

Each such combination defines D, E, F as 9 -A, 9 -B, 9 -C.

But we also have to ensure that D, E, F are digits, i.e., 0-9.

But since A, B, C can be 0-9, but their sum is 8, so each of them is at most 8, so D, E, F=9 - A, etc., will be at least 1. So, D, E, F are each 1-9, which are valid digits.

So, each of these 45 combinations is valid.

Hence, in Case 1, Subcase 1b, there are 45 possibilities.

Now, moving to Case 2: k1=0, k2=1  
So:

S1=8, S2=9, S3=9  
Which means:

A + D=8  
B + E=9  
C + F=9

From the second condition, either S4=9, S5=9 or S4=8, S5=19.

So, let's consider both possibilities.

Subcase 2a: S4=9, S5=9  
Subcase 2b: S4=8, S5=19

Let me start with Subcase 2a.

Subcase 2a: S4=9, S5=9  
So:

A + B + C=9  
D + E + F=9

But we also have D=8 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

Substituting into S5= D + E + F:

(8 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) =9  
(8 +9 +9) - (A + B + C) =9  
26 -9=17=9? No, 17≠9. So Subcase 2a is impossible.

So, now Subcase 2b: S4=8, S5=19  
Which gives:

A + B + C=8  
D + E + F=19

Again, D=8 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

Substituting into S5= D + E + F:

(8 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) =19  
(8 +9 +9) - (A + B + C) =19  
26 -8=18=19? No, 18≠19. So, this is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. So, Subcase 2b also leads to a contradiction.

Hmm, that suggests that in Case 2, both subcases lead to contradictions. So, Case 2 is impossible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, in Subcase 2a, I substituted D=8 -A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

So, S5= D + E + F= (8 -A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) =8 +9 +9 - (A + B + C)=26 - (A + B + C).

But in Subcase 2a, S4=9, so A + B + C=9.

Thus, S5=26 -9=17.

But in Subcase 2a, S5=9, so 17≠9 → impossible.

In Subcase 2b, S4=8, so A + B + C=8.

So, S5=26 -8=18.

But in Subcase 2b, S5=19, so 18≠19 → impossible.

Thus, in Case 2, both subcases are impossible. Thus, Case 2 contributes nothing.

Therefore, the only possible case is Case1, Subcase1b, which has 45 possibilities.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check.

In Case 2, if S1=8, S2=9, S3=9.

So, A + D=8, B + E=9, C + F=9.

Then, D=8 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

So, S5= D + E + F= (8 -A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) =26 - (A + B + C).

Given that S4= A + B + C is either 9 or 8.

If S4=9, then S5=26-9=17, which isn't 9 or 19.

If S4=8, then S5=26-8=18, which isn't 9 or 19.

Thus, in both subcases, S5 is 17 or 18, which doesn't match the required S5=9 or 19. So, indeed, Case 2 is impossible.

Therefore, the only possible case is Case1, Subcase1b, which has 45 possibilities.

But wait, in the example given, the grid is:

0 0 8  
9 9 1

Which gives:

A=0, B=0, C=8  
D=9, E=9, F=1

So, let's check if this is included in Case1, Subcase1b.

Case1: S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, A + D=0+9=9 → correct.

B + E=0+9=9 → correct.

C + F=8+1=9 → correct.

S4= A+B+C=0+0+8=8 → correct.

S5= D+E+F=9+9+1=19 → correct.

So, yes, it's included in the 45 possibilities.

But wait, in the first case, when I calculated 45 possibilities for (A,B,C) with A + B + C=8, each from 0-9. But wait, in the example, C=8, which is allowed because A + B + C=0+0+8=8.

So, it's a valid case.

But, now, I have to make sure that in Case1, Subcase1b, all the digits are valid, meaning A, B, C are digits, and D, E, F=9 -A, etc., are also digits.

Which they are because A, B, C are 0-9, so D, E, F=9 - A etc., are 9-0=9 down to 0. Wait, but if A=9, then D=0, which is allowed.

So, all possibilities are valid.

Thus, the total number of grids is 45.

Wait, but hold on. I think I might have missed something. Because, in the initial analysis, I considered S4 and S5, but perhaps I need to also consider whether the top to bottom numbers can have leading zeros.

Looking back at the example, the top row is 0 0 8, which is 008, a three-digit number. If A is zero, that's allowed. Similarly, the bottom row is 991, which is fine.

But the vertical numbers: the first column is 09, which is 9, the second column is 09=9, and the third is 81. So, leading zeros are allowed in the vertical numbers because they are single-digit numbers in reality. Wait, no, actually, no. Each vertical number is a two-digit number, right? Because each column has two digits: top and bottom.

Wait, in the example, the first column is 0 and 9, which is 09, but that's a two-digit number, 09, which is 9. Similarly, the second column is 0 and 9, which is 09=9, and the third is 8 and 1, which is 81.

So, in the vertical numbers, leading zeros are allowed because, for example, 09 is a two-digit number but equals 9.

So, the way the problem is set up, the vertical numbers are two-digit numbers, so leading zeros are allowed.

So, that's fine.

Wait, but in the problem statement, when it says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom", each column is treated as a two-digit number. So, 09 is 9, 09 is 9, 81 is 81. So, the sum is 9 +9 +81=99.

So, all is correct.

Therefore, the only valid grids are those in Case1, Subcase1b, where A + B + C=8, and D=9 -A, E=9 - B, F=9 -C.

The number of such grids is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, where A, B, C are digits (0-9).

As we established, this is 45.

But wait, wait another second. Let me think again. Are all those 45 solutions valid? Because, in the grid, each cell is a digit, so A, B, C, D, E, F must be digits (0-9). Since A, B, C are digits, D=9 -A, E=9 -B, F=9 -C must also be digits. Since A, B, C are from 0 to9, 9 -A, etc., are from 0 to9 as well. So, yes, they are all valid.

Hence, the total number of valid grids is 45.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I might have made a mistake in the initial problem setup.

Let me go back to the first condition.

The first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.

Each of these numbers is a three-digit number: A B C and D E F.

So, 100A +10B + C +100D +10E + F=999.

Which can be written as:

100(A + D) +10(B + E) + (C + F) =999.

Now, in the initial analysis, I considered the carry-over from each digit to the next.

But perhaps another approach is to realize that:

The sum of the two numbers is 999, so each digit of the sum is 9. So, when adding the two numbers digit-wise, we have:

For units place: C + F =9 or 19  
Tens place: B + E + carry-over from units =9 or 19  
Hundreds place: A + D + carry-over from tens =9 or 19.

Wait, this is a better approach perhaps.

Because, when adding two numbers digit by digit:

Let me denote:

Let’s define:

C + F = 9 +10*c1  
B + E + c1 =9 +10*c2  
A + D + c2=9 +10*c3

But since the total sum is 999, which is 999 +0 = 999, so c3 must be 0.

Thus, we have:

c3=0

So,

From the hundreds place:  
A + D + c2=9

From the tens place:  
B + E + c1=9 +10*c2

From the units place:  
C + F=9 +10*c1

So, here, c1 and c2 are carry-over digits, each can be 0 or1 because the maximum sum in each digit is 9+9=18, so c1, c2 can be 0 or1.

So, let's model this.

Equations:

1. A + D + c2=9  
2. B + E + c1=9 +10*c2  
3. C + F=9 +10*c1

Additionally, c1 and c2 can be 0 or1.

Let me consider all possible combinations of c1 and c2.

Possible c1, c2 pairs: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

Let me analyze each case.

Case 1: c1=0, c2=0  
Then:

Equation3: C + F=9  
Equation2: B + E=9  
Equation1: A + D=9

So, all digit sums are 9.

Additionally, from the second condition, we have:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F)=99

Which can be written as:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F)=99

Let me denote S4= A + B + C, S5= D + E + F.

So, 10*S4 + S5=99

Which gives S5=99 -10*S4.

But S5 must be the sum of D, E, F, which are digits. Since D =9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

So, S5= (9 -A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C)=27 - (A + B + C)=27 - S4.

So, 10*S4 + (27 - S4)=99  
→9*S4 +27=99  
→9*S4=72  
→S4=8.

So, S4=8, S5=27 -8=19.

So, in this case, we have S4=8, S5=19.

So, A + B + C=8  
D + E + F=19

But since D=9 -A, E=9 -B, F=9 -C, their sum is 27 - (A + B + C)=27 -8=19, which matches.

So, in this case, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, where A, B, C are digits (0-9). As before, this is C(8 +3-1,3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

Each solution defines D=9 -A, E=9 -B, F=9 -C.

So, 45 possibilities.

Case 2: c1=0, c2=1  
Then:

Equation3: C + F=9  
Equation2: B + E +0=9 +10*1=19 →B + E=19  
Equation1: A + D +1=9 →A + D=8

So, in this case:

C + F=9  
B + E=19  
A + D=8

But B and E are digits (0-9), so B + E=19 is only possible if B=9 and E=10, but E is a digit (0-9), so E=10 is impossible. Therefore, this case is impossible.

Case 3: c1=1, c2=0  
Then:

Equation3: C + F=9 +10*1=19  
Equation2: B + E +1=9 +10*0=9 → B + E=8  
Equation1: A + D +0=9 → A + D=9

So, in this case:

C + F=19  
B + E=8  
A + D=9

But C and F are digits (0-9), so C + F=19 is possible only if C=9 and F=10, but F must be <=9. So, impossible. Thus, this case is impossible.

Case 4: c1=1, c2=1  
Then:

Equation3: C + F=9 +10*1=19 → impossible, as above.

So, only Case1 is possible, leading to 45 solutions.

Therefore, the total number of grids is 45.

Wait a second, but earlier, in the initial analysis with carry-over variables, I considered k1 and k2 and found 45 solutions, and now with this approach, same result.

So, perhaps the answer is 45.

But wait, let me just check with the example.

The example grid:

A=0, B=0, C=8  
D=9, E=9, F=1

So, A + B + C=0+0+8=8 → S4=8  
D + E + F=9+9+1=19 → S5=19  
Which is consistent with Case1.

So, yes, it's included.

Wait, but what about another grid? For example:

A=1, B=2, C=5 → sum=8  
D=8, E=7, F=4 → sum=19

This is allowed.

So, each combination of A, B, C that sums to8, with D, E, F=9 -A, 9 -B, 9 -C, gives a valid grid.

But wait, in this case, in the first case where c1=0 and c2=0, the units digit sum is 9, tens digit sum is9, hundreds digit sum is9, with no carry-over.

Which is correct because 008 +991=999, and the vertical sum is9 +9 +81=99.

Wait, but in this case, is 008 +991=999? Yes, because 8 +991=999.

So, all is correct.

Thus, the total number of valid grids is45.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the grid is 2x3, so each row is a 3-digit number, and each column is a 2-digit number.

Wait, but is there a possibility that the vertical numbers are interpreted as two-digit numbers, which could have leading zeros, but when summed, they contribute to the total.

But in our analysis, we considered the vertical sum as 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F)=99. Which is correct.

So, all right, I think the answer is 45. So, the number of ways is \boxed{45}.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that:

1. The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by reading the grid left to right is 999.
2. The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by reading the grid top to bottom is 99.

We label the grid cells as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline A & B & C \\ \hline D & E & F \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the first condition
The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999:
\[
(100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999
\]
We analyze the digit sums:
- Hundreds place: \(A + D + k_2 = 9\)
- Tens place: \(B + E + k_1 = 9\) (where \(k_1\) is the carry-over from the units place)
- Units place: \(C + F = 9 + 10k_1\)

### Step 2: Analyze the second condition
The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99:
\[
(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99
\]
Let \(S_4 = A + B + C\) and \(S_5 = D + E + F\). Then:
\[
10S_4 + S_5 = 99
\]
Possible pairs \((S_4, S_5)\) are \((9, 9)\) and \((8, 19)\).

### Step 3: Combine both conditions
From the first condition, we consider carry-over values \(k_1\) and \(k_2\), which can be 0 or 1. We analyze the valid cases:

1. **Case 1: \(k_1 = 0, k_2 = 0\)**
   - \(A + D = 9\)
   - \(B + E = 9\)
   - \(C + F = 9\)
   - \(S_4 = 8\), \(S_5 = 19\)

   Substituting \(D = 9 - A\), \(E = 9 - B\), \(F = 9 - C\) into \(S_5\):
   \[
   (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) = 19 \implies 27 - (A + B + C) = 19 \implies A + B + C = 8
   \]
   The number of non-negative integer solutions to \(A + B + C = 8\) is \(\binom{10}{2} = 45\).

2. **Case 2: \(k_1 = 0, k_2 = 1\)**
   - \(A + D = 8\)
   - \(B + E = 9\)
   - \(C + F = 9\)
   - \(S_4 = 9\), \(S_5 = 9\)

   Substituting \(D = 8 - A\), \(E = 9 - B\), \(F = 9 - C\) into \(S_5\):
   \[
   (8 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) = 9 \implies 26 - (A + B + C) = 9 \implies A + B + C = 17
   \]
   This leads to contradictions with the second condition, so this case is impossible.

### Final Answer
The only valid case contributes 45 solutions. Thus, the number of ways to fill the grid is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
