Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking for. The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. Once I find that p, I then need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by recalling some number theory. If a prime p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p², because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then squaring both sides gives n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². So, the order of n modulo p² divides 8. But wait, actually, maybe the order modulo p is something else. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by looking at primes where -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p². Alternatively, primes p where the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Because if such an x exists, then p divides x⁴ + 1, so p² might also divide some m⁴ +1.

I remember that for primes p ≡ 1 mod 8, -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p. Because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, so for -1 to be a fourth power, 4 must divide the order of -1, which is 2. So, 4 divides 2, which is only possible if 2 divides 2, which it does. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, I think that for a prime p, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution only if p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, and the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 implies that the order of x² is 4, because (x²)² = x⁴ ≡ -1, so (x²)^4 ≡ 1. Therefore, 4 divides the order of the multiplicative group, which is p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 4, but more specifically, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, does that mean that the primes we are looking for are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8? Because if so, then the least such prime is 17. But wait, 17 is the fifth prime, so maybe it's 17, but let me check.

Wait, let's list primes and check for which p, p² divides some n⁴ +1. Let's start with small primes.

Let's try p=2 first. For p=2, we can see if 2² divides any n⁴ +1. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4. n can be 0
