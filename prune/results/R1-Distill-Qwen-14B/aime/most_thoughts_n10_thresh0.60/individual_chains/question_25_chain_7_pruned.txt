Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to understand what's being asked. I need to find the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. 

Let me break down the information given:

- Total residents: 900
- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195
- Residents owning a set of golf clubs (G): 367
- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H). Wait, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So H is universal, which means H = 900.

Also, it's given that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the task is to find the number who own all four.

Hmm, I think I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. But inclusion-exclusion usually counts the union, but since we have specific counts for exactly two and exactly three, maybe I can approach it differently.

Let me denote:
- a = number of people owning exactly two items
- b = number owning exactly three items
- c = number owning all four.

Wait, but the problem says a = 437 and b = 234, and we're to find c.

But wait, how does that fit into the inclusion-exclusion formula?

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the total number of ownerships across all items. Each resident owns some combination of these items, and the total number of 'ownership instances' is the sum of each individual's ownerships.

But since each person can own any number of items, the total number of ownerships would be the sum of the people owning each item.

So, total ownerships = D + G + S + H.

Wait, but H is 900, since everyone owns it. So let's compute that.

D = 195, G = 367, S = 562, H = 900.

So total ownerships = 195
