Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but let me break it down.

First, let me recall some properties of rectangular boxes and spheres. The smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box with side lengths x, y, z is given by the formula d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. So, my goal is to minimize r, which is equivalent to minimizing the space diagonal d.

Wait, but the sphere must contain each box in B. So I need the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, because the sphere needs to contain even the box with the largest space diagonal. Wait, no, no—wait, no. Because each box in B is a box with surface area 54 and volume 23. So, the sphere needs to contain all such boxes. But since all boxes have the same surface area and volume, I think that the maximum space diagonal would be the one that defines the minimal enclosing sphere. So I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, then that would give me the minimal sphere radius.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem states that r is the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in B. So, it's the minimal sphere that works for all boxes in B. But if different boxes have different space diagonals, then the sphere has to be big enough to contain the largest space diagonal among them. So, to find r, I need to find the maximum of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then divide by 2.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 (surface area formula) and xyz = 23 (volume). Then, r squared would be (sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2)² = (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, I actually need to find the maximum of (x² + y² + z²) given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Hmm, okay, so I need to maximize x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23. This sounds like a constrained optimization problem.

Let me write down the constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

And the function to maximize is x² + y² + z².

I remember that in optimization problems with multiple variables, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be used. Alternatively, sometimes we can express variables in terms of each other and find maxima/minima that way. But since this has three variables, it might get complicated. Maybe I can use some inequality relations or substitution.

Let me think about the relationships between x, y, z. Since we have their sum of products and product, maybe I can use symmetric functions or some substitution.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz = 27, and Q = xyz = 23.

We need to find x²
