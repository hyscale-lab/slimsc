Okay, so I need to solve this problem where we have four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I have to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that a rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at right angles and bisecting each other. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I consider the diagonals AC and BD, their midpoints are both at (0,0). That means if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint between A and C is (0,0). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q).

So, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q). All of these lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Therefore, each of these points satisfies the equation:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1  
For point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1  
For point C: (-x)²/20 - (-y)²/24 = x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 (same as A)  
For point D: (-p)²/20 - (-q)²/24 = p²/20 - q²/24 = 1 (same as B)

So, points A and C are on the hyperbola, as are B and D.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DA. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to work with the properties of the diagonals. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they bisect each other at right angles. So, if I can find the lengths of the diagonals AC and BD, maybe I can find some relation between them.

Wait, the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles and bisect each other. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of A, B, C, D are as I mentioned earlier. So, vector AC is from A(x,y) to C(-x,-y), which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B(p,q) to D(-p,-q), which is (-2p, -2q). 

Since AC and BD are diagonals of the rhombus, they should be perpendicular. So, their dot product should be zero.

So, AC • BD = (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq = 0  
Which simplifies to xp + yq = 0.

So, that's one condition: xp + yq = 0.

Now, I need to find BD². BD is the length of the diagonal from B to D. Since B is (p, q) and D is (-p, -q), the distance between B and D is sqrt[(p - (-p))² + (q - (-q))²] = sqrt[(2p)² + (2q)²] = 2*sqrt(p² + q²). So, BD² is (2*sqrt(p² + q²))² = 4(p² + q²).

Similarly, AC² is 4(x² + y²).

But since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal. Let me compute the length of AB.

Points A(x,y) and B(p,q). The distance between them is sqrt[(x - p)² + (y - q)²]. Since all sides are equal, AB² = BC² = CD² = DA².

But maybe it's easier to express in terms of vectors. The sides of the rhombus are vectors AB and AD. The rhombus sides are equal and the diagonals are perpendicular. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the rhombus can also be considered as a kite with two pairs of adjacent sides equal.

Wait, perhaps using vectors is a better approach. Let me denote vectors OA, OB, OC, OD as (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q), respectively.

In a rhombus, the adjacent sides are equal and the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AB and AD should have the same length.

Vector AB = B - A = (p - x, q - y)  
Vector AD = D - A = (-p - x, -q - y)

So, the lengths squared:

|AB|² = (p - x)² + (q - y)²  
|AD|² = (-p - x)² + (-q - y)² = (p + x)² + (q + y)²

Since |AB|² = |AD|²,

(p - x)² + (q - y)² = (p + x)² + (q + y)²

Expanding both sides:

p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y² = p² + 2px + x² + q² + 2qy + y²

Simplify:

-2px - 2qy = 2px + 2qy  
Bring all terms to one side:

-4px -4qy = 0  
Divide both sides by -4:

px + qy = 0

Wait, that's the same condition we had earlier from the diagonals being perpendicular! So, that's consistent. So, we already have that condition.

So, the key conditions we have are:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1  
2. p²/20 - q²/24 = 1  
3. px + qy = 0

And BD² is 4(p² + q²). We need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD².

Wait, actually, the problem says to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD², because we're looking for a number that's less than BD² for all possible rhombi. So, the greatest lower bound.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum BD² is achieved, but I need to check.

So, our aim is to find the minimal possible BD², which would then make the greatest lower bound just that minimal value. So, if we can find the minimal BD², then the answer is that minimal value.

Alternatively, maybe not exactly, because we need the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi. If BD² can get arbitrarily close to a certain value from above, then that would be the answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of parametric equations.

Since points A and B are on the hyperbola, maybe I can parametrize them.

For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions. Let me recall that.

For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, a parametrization is (a sec θ, b tan θ). Alternatively, another parametrization is (a cosh t, b sinh t), which covers the right branch.

Wait, but since points A and C are on opposite branches, because A is (x,y) and C is (-x,-y). So, A is on the right branch (x positive), and C is on the left branch (x negative). Similarly, B and D are on opposite branches.

Wait, but in the given hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1, the transverse axis is along the x-axis, so the hyperbola has two branches. So, points A and C are on opposite branches, same with B and D.

Therefore, points A and B can be on the right branch, but C and D would be their reflections across the origin.

Wait, but in the problem statement, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola. So, perhaps both A and B are on the right branch, but their reflections C and D would be on the left branch.

Alternatively, perhaps A is on the right branch and B is on the left branch. Hmm, but since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points would be arranged such that A and C are opposite, B and D are opposite.
