Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with its diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, so BD is one of the diagonals of the rhombus, and I'm looking for the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD² across all possible such rhombuses.

First, let's recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Oh wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at the origin here, which is the center of the hyperbola as well.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, if one diagonal is BD, then the other diagonal must be AC, and since they bisect each other, each diagonal is split into two equal parts by the origin. So, if point B is at some coordinate (x, y), then point D must be at (-x, -y) because the diagonal BD passes through the origin. Similarly, points A and C must be symmetric with respect to the origin as well, so if A is (p, q), then C is (-p, -q).

So, all four points are such that they are in pairs symmetric about the origin. So, A = (p, q), C = (-p, -q); B = (x, y), D = (-x, -y). All four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Now, the rhombus is formed by these four points. So, the sides of the rhombus are AB, BC, CD, DA. Since it's a rhombus, all sides must be equal in length. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, and so on.

Let me write expressions for the distances. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2], and the distance between B and C is sqrt[(-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2]. Wait, but since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.

But maybe instead of dealing directly with the distances, it's better to use vectors or coordinate geometry properties.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, the vectors BD and AC are perpendicular. Let's write vectors BD and AC. Vector BD is D - B = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Vector AC is C - A = (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). The dot product of BD and AC is (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq. Since they are perpendicular, this must be zero. So, 4xp + 4yq = 0, which simplifies to xp + yq = 0. So, the product of the coordinates of A and B must satisfy xp + yq = 0.

Another property is that the midpoints of the diagonals coincide at the origin, which we've already considered.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the points on the hyperbola. Since the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, I can represent the points using hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbolas, a common parametrization is (a sec θ, b tan θ), where a² = 20 and b² = 24. So, a = 2√5, b = 2√6. So, points can be written as (2√5 sec θ, 2√6 tan θ). Similarly, another parametrization can be used, but maybe using hyperbola functions is better.

Wait, alternatively, points can be represented as (x, y) = (a cosh t, b sinh t), since hyper
