Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid has 7 lines in each direction, so moving from one corner to the opposite requires 8 steps right and 8 steps up. Wait, no, actually, the number of steps is 8 in each direction, so the total number of steps is 16, right. Because each step is either right or up, so to get from the lower left to upper right, you need 8 rights and 8 ups.

The problem says to find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing direction... So in a path, each time you switch from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, how does that work?

Let me think. For a path with 8 rights and 8 ups, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. For example, if you have a path that goes all right first and then all up, that's only one direction change. Similarly, if you alternate right and up each step, you have 15 direction changes, which is the maximum possible.

Wait, but we need exactly four direction changes. So, how does that translate into the structure of the path?

Each time the direction changes, the path switches from right to up or up to right. So, if there are four direction changes, the path can be divided into five segments. For example, starting with right, then up, then right, then up, then right, etc., but the number of segments is four direction changes plus one. So, five segments in total.

But these segments can be either all right or all up. So, to have four direction changes, the path will consist of five straight segments, each either horizontal or vertical, alternating directions each time.

So, the first segment could be right, then up, then right, then up, and so on, or it could start with up, then right, etc. So, the number of such paths would depend on how we arrange these segments.

Now, each segment must consist of at least one step, right? Because a direction change occurs after at least one step in the current direction. So, we can model this as partitioning the 8 right steps into some segments and the 8 up steps into some other segments, such that the total number of segments is five, with alternating directions.

Wait, actually, since the direction alternates each time, the number of segments of each direction will differ by at most one. Let me think: if there are five segments, then two possibilities: either three segments in one direction and two in the other, or if the number of segments is even? Wait, no, five is odd, so if the first segment is right, then the segments alternate R, U, R, U, R: so three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, if it starts with up, it'll be U, R, U, R, U: three up segments and two right segments.

So, in total, for four direction changes, which gives five segments, the number of right segments and up segments will be either 3 and 2 or 2 and 3, depending on the starting direction.

So,
