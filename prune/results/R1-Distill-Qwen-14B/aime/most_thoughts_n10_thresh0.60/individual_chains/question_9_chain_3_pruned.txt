Okay, so I have this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down what I know. The logarithm equations are:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms have some properties I can use. Let me recall them. One key property is that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that here.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the property, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Let me denote that as equation (1):

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let me write that as equation (2):

4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I also remember that log_b(a) is the reciprocal of log_a(b). So log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me use this to express both equations in terms of a single variable.

Let me set t = log_y(x). Then, log_x(y) = 1/t.

Substituting into equation (1):

x * (1/t) = 10 → x = 10t.

And equation (2) becomes:

4y * t = 10 → 4y t = 10 → y = 10 / (4t) = (5)/(2t).

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of t:

x = 10t,

y = 5/(2t).

But since x and y are both greater than 1, I can infer that t must be positive because logarithms of numbers greater than 1 with base greater than 1 are positive.

Now, I can express y in terms of x or vice versa. Wait, since x = 10t, then t = x / 10. Let me substitute t into the expression for y.

y = 5/(2t) = 5/(2*(x/10)) = 5/( (2x)/10 ) = 5 * (10)/(2x) = (50)/(2x) = 25/x.

So y = 25/x.

So, now, I can express the relationship between x and y as y = 25/x. Therefore, their product is xy = x*(25/x) = 25. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Is that correct?

Wait, maybe not. Let me double-check.

Wait, because I used substitution, but I should ensure that these values satisfy the original logarithmic equations. Let me verify that.

So, if y = 25/x, then x = 25/y.

Let me substitute back into the original logarithmic equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Express log_x(y^x) as x * log_x(y) = 10.

Since y = 25/x, log_x(y) = log_x(25/x) = log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) - 1.

So equation (1) becomes x*(log_x(25) - 1) = 10.

Similarly, equation (2): log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Which is 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Express log_y(x): since x = 25/y, log_y(25/y) = log_y(25) - log_y(y) = log_y(25) - 1.

So equation (2) is 4y*(log_y(25) - 1) = 10.

Now, I have two equations:

1. x*(log_x(25) - 1) = 10
2. 4y*(log_y(25) - 1) = 10

But since y = 25/x, let's substitute y into equation (2):

4*(25/x)*(log_{25/x}(25) - 1) = 10.

Hmm, that seems a bit complex. Let me see if I can express log_{25/x}(25) in terms of log_x(25).

Wait, recall that
