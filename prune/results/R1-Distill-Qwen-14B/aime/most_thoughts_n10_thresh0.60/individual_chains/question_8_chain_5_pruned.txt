Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I notice that the second equation is symmetric in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of symmetric sums.

Let me see. The expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b can be factored as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). But wait, another way to write it is (a^2)(b + c) + (b^2)(a + c) + (c^2)(a + b). Hmm, maybe that's helpful.

Since a + b + c = 300, I can express b + c as 300 - a, a + c as 300 - b, and a + b as 300 - c. So, substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Expanding each term, that becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Which I can rewrite as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. I have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I wonder if I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of the sums I already know, like a + b + c.

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, then 300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So,

90000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

I also know that (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Wait, no, actually, the correct identity is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3 S Q + 3 P

So, substituting S = 300,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P

So, going back to the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Expressed in terms of Q and P:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P] = 6,000,000

But from above, I have a² + b² + c² = 90000 - 2 Q

So, substituting that into the equation:

300*(90000 - 2 Q) - [27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P] = 6,000,000

Calculating 300*(90000 - 2 Q):

= 300*90000 - 300*2 Q
= 27,000,000 - 600 Q

So, substituting back:

27,000,000 - 600 Q - 27,000,000 + 900 Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600 Q + 900 Q) - 3P = 6,000,000

Which simplifies to:

300 Q - 3 P = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000

So, we have:

P = 100 Q - 2,000,000

Hmm, okay. So, now I have expressions involving Q and P. Since P is abc, and Q is ab + bc + ca, perhaps I can find possible integer values for Q and P.

But wait, a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so Q and P must also be nonnegative integers,
