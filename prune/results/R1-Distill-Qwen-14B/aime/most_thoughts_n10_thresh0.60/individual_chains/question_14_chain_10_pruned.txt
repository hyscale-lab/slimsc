Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. Then, when N is divided by 1000, I have to find the sum of the quotient Q and the remainder R. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. We need N to be a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N has digits a, b, c, d, then changing a to 1 gives a number divisible by 7, changing b to 1 gives another number divisible by 7, and so on for c and d.

Since we're looking for the greatest such number, I think I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies this condition. But that might take too long, so maybe I can find a smarter approach.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero. So, for each digit position (A, B, C, D), changing that digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

So, let's write down what each of these changes would look like:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD. So, 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD. This must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D. Divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1. Divisible by 7.

Hmm, okay. So each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. Since 1BCD is a number, it's 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Similarly, A1CD is 1000A + 100 + 10C + D, and so on.

Wait, maybe I can express each condition mathematically.

Let me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then, the four modified numbers are:

1. 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
2. 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
3. 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1

Each of these must be divisible by 7. So, for each modified number, when divided by 7, the remainder is zero.

Let me represent each condition as an equation:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, okay, so we have four congruence equations. Maybe I can simplify these modulo 7.

First, I need to find the values of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7, because these coefficients will be multiplied by A, B, C, D.

Calculating:

1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 ÷ 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.
100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 - 98=2. 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.
10 mod 7: 10-7=3, so 10 ≡3 mod7.
1 mod7 is 1.

So now:

1. (6)*1 + (2)*B + (3)*C + D ≡ 0 mod7. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the first modified number is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So, when mod7, it's (1000 mod7) + (100B mod7) + (10C mod7) + (D mod7). So, 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, the second modified number is 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. So, mod7:

(6A) + (2*1) + (3C) + D ≡0 mod7 → 6A + 2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Third modified number is 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Mod7:

6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Fourth modified number is 1000A + 100B +10C +1. Mod7:

6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So now, I have four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7  → Equation (1)
2. 6A + 2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7 → Equation (2)
3. 6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7 → Equation (3)
4. 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7 → Equation (4)

Hmm, okay. So four equations with four variables: A, B, C, D. But A, B, C, D are digits, so each is between 0 and 9, with A ≥1.

But wait, since N is a four-digit number, A can be from 1 to 9, and B, C, D from 0 to9.

So, perhaps I can find relationships between these equations.

Let me try subtracting equations to eliminate variables.
