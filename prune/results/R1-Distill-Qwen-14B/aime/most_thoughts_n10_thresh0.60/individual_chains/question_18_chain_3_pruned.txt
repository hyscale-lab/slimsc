Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. 

First, I need to visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a twelve-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. I think each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. So each internal angle is 150Â°, which is pretty big.

Now, the problem talks about forming rectangles inside this dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle are either edges of the dodecagon or the diagonals that connect non-adjacent vertices.

I think the key here is to figure out how to choose four points (vertices) of the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. Because in a regular polygon, symmetry plays a big role, so maybe certain pairs of points will form the opposite sides of a rectangle.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can have different lengths. For example, the length of a side is the same, but diagonals can connect vertices that are two apart, three apart, etc., leading to different lengths. So for a rectangle to be formed, we need two pairs of points that are opposite each other, each pair separated by the same number of steps around the polygon.

Hmm, so maybe for each possible step size (i.e., the number of edges between connected vertices), I can count how many rectangles can be formed with that step size.

Let me think about this. In a regular polygon, a rectangle would be formed by two pairs of vertices that are diametrically opposite each other. But wait, in a dodecagon, there's no true diameter unless the number of sides is even, so 12 is even, so yes, each vertex has an opposite vertex. So, for each vertex, there's a vertex directly across the dodecagon.

But wait, a rectangle doesn't necessarily need to have its vertices diametrically opposite; it just needs to have sides that are parallel and equal. So maybe I should think in terms of the step between vertices.

Another thought: In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by choosing two different step sizes. For instance, if I pick a step size 'k' for one pair of opposite sides and another step size 'm' for the other pair, then I can form a rectangle.

Wait, but that might not always work. Because the sides have to be straight lines, so the step sizes need to be such that the lines are straight and the angles are right angles.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to note that in a regular dodecagon, the
