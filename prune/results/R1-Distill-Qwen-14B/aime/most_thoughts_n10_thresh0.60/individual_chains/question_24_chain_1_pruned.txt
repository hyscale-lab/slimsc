Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let me break this down. Mode is the number that appears most frequently. Unique mode means only one number appears more often than the others, and that's 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.

The sum is 30. So all the numbers add up to 30. The median is a positive integer not in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list if the list has an odd number of elements. Wait, but if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers. So, if the median isn't in the list, that suggests it's an average of two numbers that aren't the same, perhaps.

Let me think about the structure of the list. Since the mode is 9, 9 appears more than any other number. So, the list must contain 9 at least twice, and more than any other number. Let's consider possible lengths of the list.

Let me consider the possible number of elements in the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements. The sum is 30, so the average is 30/n. But I don't know n yet.

Wait, maybe I can figure out the number of elements. Since the median is not in the list, that implies that the two middle numbers average to a number not present. So, if the list has an even number of elements, say 2k, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. Since that median isn't in the list, it must be that (a_k + a_{k+1})/2 is not present in the list.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, say
