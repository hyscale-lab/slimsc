Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. The set B consists of all rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let me recall some properties of rectangular boxes, surface area, and volume. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, let's call them x, y, and z. The surface area S is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume V is xyz = 23. So, I have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54  --> which simplifies to xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must encompass the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the radius r is half of the space diagonal.

The space diagonal d of a box is given by sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). So, r = d/2 = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/2. Therefore, r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize r^2, which is equivalent to minimizing (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). So, I need to find the minimal value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Let me note that down:

Minimize: x^2 + y^2 + z^2

Subject to:
1. xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

Hmm, okay, so this is an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers for this, but maybe there's a smarter way without calculus. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can express x^2 + y^2 + z^2 in terms of the given constraints. I know that (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2*27 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 54. Therefore, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, if I can find the minimal value of (x + y + z)^2, then I can find x^2 + y^2 + z^2, and hence r^2.

Wait, but I don't know x + y + z. Maybe I can find a relationship involving x + y + z. Let me think.

I have two equations: xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23. These are the symmetric sums of x, y, z. If I can relate x + y + z to these, perhaps using inequalities.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

Subject to the constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27
h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

Wait, but Lagrange multipliers with two constraints might be a bit involved. Let me see if I can parameterize the variables or make substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that x, y, z are all equal because of symmetry. If x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x^2 = 54, so x^2 = 9, x = 3. Then volume would be x^3 = 27. But the volume here is given as 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube is not possible. Therefore, the minimal sphere won't correspond to a cube. So, the minimal x^2 + y^2 + z^2 must correspond to a box that is not a cube.

Hmm. So, perhaps I need to set up the Lagrangian with two constraints.

The Lagrangian function would be:

L = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set them to zero.

Partial derivative with respect to x:

2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly, partial derivative with respect to y:

2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

And partial derivative with respect to z:

2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)
4. xy + yz + xz = 27
5. xyz = 23

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry here. Let's assume that two variables are equal, say y = z. Maybe that would simplify things. Let's see.

Let me set y = z. Then, the variables become x, y, y.

So now, the constraints become:

1. xy + y^2 + xy = 27 --> 2xy + y^2 =27
2. x y^2 =23.

So, let me write these equations:

Equation A: 2xy + y^2 =27

Equation B: x y^2 =23

From Equation B, x = 23/(y^2)

Substitute into Equation A:

2*(23/(y^2))*y + y^2 =27

Simplify:

(46/y) + y^2 =27

Multiply both sides by y to eliminate the denominator:

46 + y^3 = 27y

Bring all terms to one side:

y^3 -27y +46=0

So, y^3 -27y +46=0

Let me try to factor this cubic equation. Let's test possible rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing y=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0

y=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, y=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (y -2) out of the cubic. Let's perform polynomial division:

Divide y^3 -27y +46 by (y -2).

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

Multiply 2*1=2, add to next coefficient: 0+2=2

2 | 1  2  ( -27 + 4= -23 )

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient (0): 2.

Multiply 2 by 2:4. Add to next coefficient (-27): -23.

Multiply -23 by 2: -46. Add to last coefficient 46: 0. Perfect.

So, the cubic factors as (y -2)(y^2 +2y -23)=0

Set equal to zero:

(y -2)(y^2 +2y -23)=0

Solutions are y=2, and solutions of y^2 +2y -23=0.

Using quadratic formula: y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

So, y can be 2, -1 + 2√6, or -1 -2√6.

But since y is a length, it must be positive, so y=2, or y= -1 + 2√6. Let's calculate -1 + 2√6: √6 is approx 2.45, so 2√6≈4.90, so -1 +4.90≈3.90>0. Also, y cannot be negative, so y=2 or y≈3.90.

Now, let's find x for each case.

Case 1: y=2.

From Equation B: x =23/(y^2)=23/4=5.75

So, x=5.75, y=2, z=2.

Compute x^2 + y^2 + z^2: (5.75)^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = (33.0625) +4 +4= 41.0625, which is 41.0625. Let me write that as a fraction: 5.75 is 23/4, so (23/4)^2 = 529/16. Then, 529/16 +4 +4 = 529/16 + 8/1 +8/1 = 529/16 + 16/1 +16/1? Wait, no, 4 is 16/4, but 529/16 +4 +4 = 529/16 + 8/4 +8/4? Wait, no, 4 is 4/1, so to add to 529/16, convert 4 to 64/16. So, 529/16 + 64/16 + 64/16 = (529 +64 +64)/16 = (529 +128)/16= 657/16.

So, x^2 + y^2 + z^2=657/16. So, r^2=(657/16)/4=657/64.

Wait, wait, no. Because r^2 is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4. So, (657/16)/4 =657/(16*4)=657/64.

Case 2: y= -1 +2√6≈3.90

Compute x: x=23/(y^2). Let's compute y^2.

y= -1 +2√6

y^2= (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2√6)=1 + 24 + (-4√6)=25 -4√6.

So, x=23/(25 -4√6). Let's rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

x=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify denominator: 529 is 23^2, so 529=23*23. So,

x= [23*(25 +4√6)]/(23*23
