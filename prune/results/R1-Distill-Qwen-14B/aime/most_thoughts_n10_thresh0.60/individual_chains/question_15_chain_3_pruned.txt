Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner. The catch is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, I remember that in grid paths, each path is a sequence of moves either right or up. For an 8x8 grid, going from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, the number of unrestricted paths would be the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But this problem is more specific because it requires the path to change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Let me think. Each time the path changes direction, it means it switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, if a path starts by moving right, the first change would be when it switches to up, the second change when it switches back to right, and so on. 

If the path changes direction four times, how many segments does it have? Well, each direction change adds a new segment. So, starting with one initial segment, each change adds one. So, four direction changes would result in five segments. For example, right, up, right, up, right would have four changes and five segments. Wait, but the path could also start with up instead of right. Hmm, but in this grid, the starting point is the lower left, so the first move could be either right or up. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left (0,0) to the upper right (8,8). So, you can start by moving right along the x-axis or up along the y-axis. So, either direction is possible. Therefore, the initial direction is either right or up, and each subsequent direction change alternates.

But in this problem, since it's an 8x8 grid, the path must consist of 8 rights and 8 ups. So, the direction changes must alternate between right and up. Therefore, a path with four direction changes will have either five segments starting with right or starting with up.

Wait, let's think about that.
