Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC with some given conditions: the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me jot down what I know.

First, triangle ABC has circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The incenter I and circumcenter O are given, and IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA ⊥ OI. That seems like a key condition that might lead to some relationship between the sides or angles of the triangle.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that right? Let me recall. Yes, I think that's correct. So, OI² = R² - 2Rr. Plugging in the values, R is 13 and r is 6.

So OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). That's interesting.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, by Pythagoras theorem, OA² = IO² + IA².

Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA = 13. IO is sqrt(13), and IA is the inradius? Wait, no. IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. Is IA equal to the inradius? No, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but IA is the distance from I to vertex A, which is different.

Hmm, okay, so IA is not the inradius. The inradius is given as 6, which is the distance from I to each side. So, IA is something else.

But in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, we have OA² = IO² + IA².

So, OA is 13, IO is sqrt(13), so:

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²
169 = 13 + IA²
IA² = 169 -13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

Okay, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). Got that.

Now, I need to find AB·AC. Hmm. Let me think about how to relate IA with the sides of the triangle.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.

Wait, maybe I can use trigonometric relationships here. Let me recall that in a triangle, the length from the incenter to a vertex can be
