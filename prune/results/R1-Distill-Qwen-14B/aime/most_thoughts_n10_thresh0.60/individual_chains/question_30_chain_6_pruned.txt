Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, but maybe that's not directly useful here. Let's see.

The product I'm dealing with is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, each term in the product is a quadratic in ω^k. Let me see if I can manipulate each term to make it easier to handle.

Looking at the term 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}, I can factor this expression. Let me write it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me let x = ω^k, so the term becomes x² - 2x + 2. Can I factor this quadratic? Let's find its roots.

The roots would be x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, substituting back, each term in the product is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Since the product is over all k from 0 to 12, and ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity, maybe I can express this product in terms of cyclotomic polynomials or some other known product formula.

I recall that for a root of unity ζ, the product ∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - ζ^k) is equal to x^n - 1. But here, I have products of two such terms, each with x replaced by (1 + i) and (1 - i) respectively.

Wait, so the product becomes [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Each of these products is similar to evaluating the polynomial x^{13} - 1 at x = (1 + i) and x = (1 - i), but with a sign change because of the negative sign in each term. Let me see:

We know that ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^{13} - 1. So, if I set x = (1 + i), then ∏_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, ∏_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - i) - ω^k) = (1 - i)^13 - 1.

But wait, in our case, the product is ∏ (ω^k - (1 + i)) = ∏ ( -( (1 + i) - ω^k ) ) = (-1)^13 * ∏ ( (1 + i) - ω^k ) = - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ). Similarly for the other product.

Therefore, the total product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

So, now I need to compute (1
