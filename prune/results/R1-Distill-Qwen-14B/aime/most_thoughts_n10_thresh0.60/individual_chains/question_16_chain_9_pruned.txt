Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, alright. Let me break this down. I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Then, once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

First, I should probably think about primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1. That means n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p² because if I square both sides, (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² ≡ 1 mod p². Therefore, the order of n modulo p² must divide 8. Wait, but the multiplicative order of n modulo p² must divide φ(p²) which is p(p-1). So for primes p where 8 divides p(p-1), such an n could exist.

Wait, but 8 divides p(p-1) only if p is 2 or primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8, because φ(p²) = p(p-1). So for p=2, φ(4)=2, but 8 doesn't divide φ(4)=2, right? Wait, so maybe p=2 is a candidate?

Let me check p=2. If p=2, then p²=4. Does there exist n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 4? Let's test n=1: 1 +1=2, not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, not divisible by 4. Wait, n=3: 81 +1=82, 82 divided by 4 is 20.5, so no. Wait, is there any n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4?

Wait, n⁴ mod 4. Let's see: For any integer n, n is either even or odd. If n is even, n=2k, so n⁴=16k⁴, which is 0 mod 4
