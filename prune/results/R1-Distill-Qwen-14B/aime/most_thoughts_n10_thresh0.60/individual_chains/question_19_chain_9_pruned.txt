Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. The given information includes that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the area. The formula is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. The inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter: r = Δ/s, where s = (a+b+c)/2.

Given that R is 13 and r is 6, maybe I can relate these somehow. Also, the condition IA perpendicular to OI might give me some relationship between the inradius, circumradius, and other elements of the triangle.

Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the inradius to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the inradius and the circumradius. Hmm, that seems like a specific condition. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry or vector methods here, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities or known formulas involving the inradius, circumradius, and other centers. Let me think about the positions of O and I. In general, O is the circumcenter, so it's the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and I is the incenter, the intersection of the angle bisectors.

Another thought: maybe using the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I recall that the distance OI is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check that. Oh yeah, that's a standard formula in triangle geometry. So, OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI.

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, interesting.

But we also know that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero. Maybe I can express these vectors in coordinate form.

Wait, maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system could help. Let me try that.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations since it's the incenter. Then, the circumcenter O is at some point (h, k). But wait, the line OI is the line connecting O and I, which in this coordinate system is the line from (0,0) to (h,k). Then, vector OI is (h,k).

Point A is another vertex. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), the vector IA is from I to A, which is just the coordinates of A, say (x, y). So, vector IA is (x, y). The vector OI is (h
