Okay, let's try to figure out this math problem. So, the problem is: Find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. Then, for that p, find the smallest m that satisfies m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p² are related to certain properties of p. Maybe I should start by checking small primes and see if n⁴ +1 is divisible by p² for some n.

Let me list the small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

First, test p=2. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod 4.

Compute n⁴ mod 4. Let's see:

n even: n=2k, so n⁴ = 16k⁴ ≡ 0 mod 4.

n odd: n=2k+1, n⁴ = (2k+1)^4. Let's compute modulo 4.

(2k+1)^4 expands to 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k + 1. Modulo 4, all terms except 1 are 0, so n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 4. Then n⁴ +1 ≡ 2 mod 4, which isn't 0. So p=2 is not possible because for any n, n⁴ +1 is either 1+1=2 mod4 or 0+1=1 mod4, neither is 0.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n is even, n⁴ is 0 mod4, so n⁴ +1 is 1 mod4. If n is odd, n⁴ is 1 mod4, so n⁴ +1 is 2 mod4. So indeed, no solution for p=2. So p must be an odd prime.

Next, p=3. Let's check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9.

Compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod9 has residues 0-8).

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: 256 mod9. Let's compute 4²=16≡7, so 4⁴=(4²)²=7²=49≡4 mod9. So n=4: 4⁴≡4 mod9
n=5: 5²=25≡7, so 5⁴=7²=49≡4 mod9
n=6: 6⁴=(6²)²=36²≡0 mod9
n=7: 7²=49≡4, so 7⁴=4²=16≡7 mod9
n=8: 8²=64≡1, so 8⁴=1²=1 mod9

So possible residues are 0,1,4,7. Looking for -1 mod9, which is 8. None of the residues for n⁴ mod9 are 8. So p=3 is out.

Next prime, p=5. Check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24, but that's a lot. Maybe find a pattern or use Euler's theorem.

Euler's totient function φ(25)=20, so for any n coprime to 25, n^20 ≡1 mod25.

But we're dealing with n^4. So perhaps the multiplicative order of n modulo25 divides 20, so n^4 is a 5th power residue? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 12 and see if any give 24 mod25 (since -1 mod25 is 24).

Let's compute:

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod25
n=2: 16
n=3: 81 mod25=6
n=4: 256 mod25. 25*10=250, 256-250=6, so 6.
Wait, 4²=16, 4⁴=16²=256≡6 mod25
n=5: 5⁴=625≡0 mod25
n=6: 6²=36, 6⁴=36²=1296. 1296/25=51*25=1275, 1296-1275=21. So 21 mod25.
n=7: 7²=49, 7⁴=49²=2401. 2401/25=96*25=2400, 2401-2400=1. So 1 mod25.
n=8: 8²=64, 64 mod25=14. 8⁴=14²=196 mod25. 196-7*25=196-175=21.
n=9: 9²=81≡6, 9⁴=6²=36≡11 mod25
n=10: 10⁴=10000≡0 mod25
n=11: 11²=121≡21, 11⁴=21²=441. 441-17*25=441-425=16 mod25
n=12: 12²=144≡19, 12⁴=19²=361. 361-14*25=361-350=11 mod25
n=13: 13²=169≡19, 13⁴=19²=361≡11 mod25
Wait, but n=13 is equivalent to -12 mod25, so perhaps the same as n=12.

Wait, but I might be missing some residues. Let me try n=17: 17²=289≡14, so 17⁴=14²
