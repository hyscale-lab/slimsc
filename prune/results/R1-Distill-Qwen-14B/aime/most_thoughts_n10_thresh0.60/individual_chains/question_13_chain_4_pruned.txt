Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop after her walk, and this includes some time t in the coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios of her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, again including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Let me break down the given information:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her walk takes 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the total time from start to finish is 4 hours. But wait, that includes both walking and coffee time.

2. When she walks at s + 2 km/h, her walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes in the coffee shop. So, same as above, but the walking speed is higher, so the walking time is less.

And I need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Hmm, so I think I can set up equations based on the distance formula: distance = speed Ã— time.

But wait, the time given includes both walking and coffee time. So, actually, the time spent walking is less than the total time by t minutes.

Wait, but I should clarify: is the total time given the walking time plus the coffee
