Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. 

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

They gave an example that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 is written as 63 in base 13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. 

Now, the task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base b such that there are over ten numbers n that are b-eautiful. 

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step. I think the key is to express n in base b and then write equations based on the given conditions.

First, let's denote n in base b as a two-digit number. In base b, a two-digit number is written as "a b", where a is the digit in the b's place and b is the units place. But wait, that might be confusing because the base is also called b. Maybe I should use different notation. Let me correct that: in base b, a two-digit number is written as "d1 d0", where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the units digit. So, the value of this two-digit number in base 10 is d1 * b + d0. 

So, n can be expressed as n = d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, both d1 and d0 must satisfy 0 ≤ d1, d0 < b. So, d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d0 can be from 0 to b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the two digits equals the square root of n. So, d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). 

But n is equal to d1*b + d0. So, substituting, we get d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0). 

Let me write that equation down:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² = d1*b + d0

Bring all terms to the left side:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of d1 and d0. Maybe we can rearrange the terms.

Let me group terms:

d1² + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0² - d0) = 0

That's a quadratic equation in d1, where the coefficients depend on d0 and b. 

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of this equation as:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² = d1*b + d0

Which can be rewritten as:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d1*b - d0 = 0

But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe we can think about this differently. Since d1 and d0 are digits, their values are limited. Let's denote s = d1 + d0, so s = sqrt(n). Then, n = s².

But n is also equal to d1*b + d0. So, we have:

d1*b + d0 = s²

And s = d1 + d0.

So, substituting s into the first equation:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2

Which is the same equation as before.

Let me rearrange this:

(d1 + d0)^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm. Maybe we can write it in terms of s:

s² - d1*b - d0 = 0

Since s = d1 + d0, we can substitute d0 = s - d1:

s² - d1*b - (s - d1) = 0

Which simplifies to:

s² - d1*b - s + d1 = 0

Factor out d1:

s² - s + d1*(1 - b) = 0

Wait, that might not be the most useful approach. Let me try another angle. Maybe express both d1 and d0 in terms of s.

We have d1 + d0 = s.

And d1*b + d0 = s².

So, let's write d0 = s - d1.

Substituting into the second equation:

d1*b + (s - d1) = s²

Simplify:

d1*b + s - d1 = s²

Factor d1:

d1*(b - 1) + s = s²

Then,

d1*(b - 1) = s² - s

So,

d1 = (s² - s) / (b - 1)

Hmm, that seems promising. Because d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, and d0 must be between 0 and b-1. So, for each s, we can compute d1 as (s² - s)/(b - 1) and check if it's an integer and within the required range.

So, for a given base b, and a given s, d1 is (s² - s)/(b - 1). Then d0 is s - d1.

Now, since s = d1 + d0, and d0 must be non-negative, s must be at least d1, which is at least 1. So, s must be ≥ 1.

But what's the range of possible s? Well, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b² - 1. So, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b² - 1). That is, s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b² - 1)).

But sqrt(b² - 1) is just a bit less than b, so s can be up to b - 1.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(b² -1):

sqrt(b² -1) = b * sqrt(1 - 1/b²) ≈ b*(1 - 1/(2b²)).

So, for integer s, the maximum s is floor(b * sqrt(1 - 1/b²)) ≈ b - 1/(2b). Since s must be an integer, the maximum s is b - 1 only if b is 2. For b > 2, sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so the maximum s is floor(sqrt(b² -1)) which is b -1 only when b² -1 is a perfect square. But wait, when is b² -1 a perfect square? Well, only when b=1, but b is at least 2. So, for b≥2, sqrt(b² -1) is not an integer, so the maximum integer s is b -1? Wait, no. Wait, for b=2, sqrt(3) ≈1.732, so s can be 1. For b=3, sqrt(8)≈2.828, so s can be up to 2. Hmm, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because for b=3, a two-digit number in base 3 ranges from 3 to 8 (since 22_3 is 2*3 + 2 =8). So, sqrt(8)≈2.828, so the maximum possible s is 2, since s must be integer.

Wait, so for general b, the maximum s is floor(sqrt(b² -1)).

But sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so floor(sqrt(b² -1)) is at most b -1.

But wait, if b=2, then the maximum n is 3 (11_2), so sqrt(3)≈1.732, so s can be 1.

If b=3, the maximum n is 8, sqrt(8)≈2.828, so s can be up to 2.

Similarly, for b=4, max n is 15, sqrt(15)≈3.872, so s can be up to 3.

Wait, so in general, s can be from 1 up to floor(sqrt(b² -1)).

But for b=4, floor(sqrt(15))=3.

Wait, but for b=10, floor(sqrt(99))=9.

So, in general, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b² -1)).

But sqrt(b) is the lower bound for s. So, for each base b, s must be at least 1 (since n is at least b, which is
