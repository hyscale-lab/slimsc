Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where p squared divides n to the fourth power plus one. Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m to the fourth plus one is divisible by p squared. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me understand what the question is asking. It says p is the smallest prime for which p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. So p² must be a divisor of n⁴ + 1. Once I find this p, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². So m is the minimal number with this property for the found p.

I think I should start by checking small prime numbers and see if any of them satisfy the condition that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. I need to check each one to see if p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Starting with p=2. Then p²=4. I need to see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4.

Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1: 1⁴ +1 = 2 mod 4, which is 2, not divisible by 4. For n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4. n=3: 81+1=82, which is 2 mod 4. n=4: 256+1=257, which is 1 mod 4. So it seems like for p=2, n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2 mod 4, never 0. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. p²=9. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9.

Compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers, but perhaps smaller cycle? Let's see.)

n=1: 1⁴ +1=2 mod 9
n=2: 16 +1=17 mod9=8
n=3: 81 +1=82 mod9=1
n=4: 256 +1=257 mod9. Let's compute 256/9: 9*28=252, so 256-252=4, so 4+1=5 mod9.
n=5: 625 +1. 625 mod9: 6+2+5=13, 1+3=4; so 4 +1=5 mod9.
n=6: 6⁴=1296, 1296 mod9=0, +1=1 mod9.
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, 7 mod9. 7+1=8 mod9.
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, 1+9=10, 1+0=1. So 1 +1=2 mod9.

So for p=3, n⁴ +1 mod9 cycles through 2,8,1,5,5,1,8,2, etc., and I don't see a 0. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next prime is 5. p²=25. Let's see if any n exists where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24, but maybe looking for a pattern or using Euler's theorem.

Euler's theorem: phi(25)=20, so n^20 ≡1 mod25 if n and 25 are coprime. So n^4 would cycle every 5 terms since 20/4=5? Not exactly sure, but let's compute n^4 mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

But before that, maybe there's a smarter way. Since we're looking for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

So n^8 ≡1 mod25. So the order of n modulo25 must divide 8, because n^8 ≡1. But the multiplicative order modulo25 can be up to 20, but for n^4 to be -1, then n^8 must be 1, so the order must divide 8 but not 4. So the order is 8.

So, is there an n such that n has order 8 modulo25?

The multiplicative group mod25 is cyclic of order 20, so 8 divides 20? Wait, 8 doesn't divide 20. Wait, 20 is the order of the group. Wait, the order of an element must divide the group order. So 8 divides 20? No, 20 divided by 8 is 2.5, which isn't integer. So 8 does not divide 20, meaning that there are no elements of order 8 in the multiplicative group mod25. Therefore, there's no solution to n^4 ≡ -1 mod25. So p=5 also doesn't work.

Hmm, so p=5 is out. Next prime is 7.

p=7, p²=49. Check if any n exists with n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod49.

So n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49. Let's see if this is possible.

Again, maybe using Euler's theorem. phi(49)=42, so n^42 ≡1 mod49 for n coprime to 49.

We can write n^4 ≡ -1 mod49. Then n^8 ≡1 mod49, so the order of n modulo49 divides 8, but doesn't divide 4. Therefore, the order must be 8.

Does 8 divide the order of the multiplicative group? The group is cyclic of order 42. 8 divides 42? 42 divided by 8 is 5.25, which is not integer. So 8 does not divide 42, meaning there are no elements of order 8 in the multiplicative group mod49. Therefore, n^4 ≡-1 mod49 has no solution. So p=7 is out.

Next prime is 11. p=11, p²=121.

We need to find n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod121.

Compute order of n modulo121. phi(121)=110.

If n^4 ≡-1 mod121, then n^8 ≡1 mod121. So the order of n must divide 8 but not 4, so the order is 8. Then 8 must divide 110? 110 divided by 8 is 13.75, which is not integer. So 8 does not divide 110, meaning the multiplicative group mod121 doesn't have elements of order 8. Therefore, n^4 ≡-1 mod121 has no solution. So p=11 is out.

Next prime is 13. p=13, p²=169.

Check if n^4 ≡-1 mod169.

phi(169)=156.

So if n^4 ≡-1 mod169, then n^8 ≡1 mod169. Therefore, the order of n divides 8, but not 4, so order is 8. Does 8 divide 156? 156 ÷8=19.5, not integer. So no element of order8 in the multiplicative group mod169. So p=13 is out.

Next prime is 17. p=17, p²=289.

Check if n^4 ≡-1 mod289.

phi(289)=272.

Similarly, n^8 ≡1 mod289, so order must be 8.

Does 8 divide 272? Yes, 272 ÷8=34. So 8 divides 272, meaning the multiplicative group mod289 has elements of order8. Therefore, there exists a solution to n^4 ≡-1 mod289.

So p=17 is the smallest prime for which p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

So now, the question is to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

So we need to find the minimal m where m^4 ≡-1 mod289.

I need to find the smallest m such that m^4 ≡ -1 mod289.

I think I can approach this by first solving m^4 ≡ -1 mod17, then lifting the solution to mod289 using Hensel's lemma or some method.

Wait, mod17, m^4 ≡-1 mod17.

But mod17, let's compute m^4 for m from 1 to 16.

But wait, in mod17, since 17 is prime, the multiplicative group is cyclic of order16. So let me find if there's a solution to m^4 ≡-1 mod17.

First, compute -1 mod17 is 16. So we need m^4 ≡16 mod17.

Compute m^4 mod17 for m=1 to 16:

1^4=1 mod17.

2^4=16 mod17.

3^4=81 mod17. 81 ÷17=4*17=68, 81-68=13.

4^4=256 mod17. 256 ÷17=15*17=255, 256-255=1.

5^4=625 mod17. 625 ÷17: 17*36=612, 625-612=13.

6^4=1296 mod17. 1296 ÷17: 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4.

7^4=2401 mod17. Let's compute 2401 ÷17: 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4.

8^4=4096 mod17. 4096 ÷17: let's compute 17*241=4097, so 4096=4097-1, so 4096 ≡-1 mod17. Which is 16 mod17.

So m=8: 8^4=4096 ≡-1 mod17.

Similarly, m=9: 9^4. Since 9= -8 mod17, so 9^4= (-8)^4=8^4≡-1 mod17.

Similarly, m=15: since 15≡-2 mod17, 15^4= (-2)^4=16 mod17.

Wait, let me compute m=15: 15^4 mod17.

15^2=225 mod17: 225 ÷17=13*17=221, 225-221=4. So 15^2 ≡4 mod17. Then 15^4=(4)^2=16 mod17. So yes, 15^4≡16 mod17.

So the solutions mod17 are m≡8,9,15,16 mod17.

Wait, no: Wait, m=8 and m=9? Wait, no: 8^4≡-1, and 9 is (-8)^4=8^4≡-1. So m=8 and m=17-8=9. Similarly, m=15= -2 mod17: 15^4= (-2)^4=16≡-1. And m=16: 16≡-1 mod17, so (-1)^4=1≡1 mod17, which is not -1. Wait, no, 16^4= (16)^2 * (16)^2=256 *256. 256 mod17 is 1, as earlier. So 1*1=1 mod17. So 16^4≡1 mod17. So not -1.

Wait, so m=8,9,15 satisfy m^4≡-1 mod17.

So solutions are m≡8,9,15 mod17.

Wait, let me check m=15 mod17: 15^4 is (15^2)^2. 15^2=225 mod17=4. 4^2=16≡-1. So yes, 15^4≡-1 mod17.

So m=8,9,15 mod17 are solutions. So perhaps m=8,9,15,16? Wait, m=16: 16^4= (16^2)^2= (256) mod17=1, squared is 1. So 16 doesn't work.

So the solutions mod17 are m≡8,9,15 mod17.

So, to lift these solutions to mod289, we can use Hensel's lemma. Since 17 is prime, and 289=17², Hensel's lemma applies.

Hensel's lemma says that
