Okay, so I have this problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to break it down. 

Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop, and the time she spends there is t minutes. The problem gives me two different scenarios with her walking speed and the total time taken, including the coffee shop time. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, again including the t minutes.

Hmm, let's see. The first scenario says she walks at a constant speed of s km/h and the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, so that 4 hours includes both the walking time and the coffee time. Similarly, the second scenario is when she walks at s + 2 km/h, and the walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, which includes t minutes again.

So, I think I can set up two equations based on these scenarios. Let me denote the walking time as the time she spends actually walking, not including the coffee shop time.

In the first case:
Total time = walking time + coffee time
4 hours = walking time at s km/h + t minutes.

Wait, but the units are a bit mixed here. She walks 9 km at s km/h, so the walking time is 9/s hours. The total time is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. The coffee time is t minutes. So, the equation would be:

9/s (in hours) converted to minutes would be (9/s)*60 minutes. Plus t minutes equals 240 minutes.

So, (9/s)*60 + t = 240. Let me write that as equation (1):
(540/s) + t = 240.

Similarly, for the second scenario:
She walks 9 km at s + 2 km/h, so walking time is 9/(s+2) hours, which is (9/(s+2))*60 minutes. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to minutes: 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes. So, the equation is:

(540/(s+2)) + t = 144. Let's call this equation (2):
540/(s+2) + t = 144.

Now, I have two equations:
1) 540/s + t = 240
2) 540/(s+2) + t = 144

I can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate t. Let's do that:

(540/s + t) - (540/(s+2) + t) = 240 - 144
540/s - 540/(s+2) = 96

Hmm, so 540*(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 96.

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s+2). That's equal to (s+2 - s)/(s(s+2)) )= 2/(s(s+2)).

So, 540*(2/(s(s+2))) = 96.

Simplify that:
(1080)/(s(s+2)) = 96.

Now, let's solve for s(s+2):

s(s+2) = 1080 / 96.

Let me compute 1080 divided by 96. Hmm, 96 * 11 = 1056, which is less than 1080. 1080 - 1056 = 24. So 24/96 = 0.25. So, it's 11.25. So, s(s+2) = 11.25.

So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

Let me solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic is s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: s = [-2 Â± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2.

Because D = b^2 -4ac = (2)^2 -4*1*(-11.25) = 4 +45=49.

So sqrt(49) =7. So,

s = (-2 +7)/2 =5/2=2.5 or s=(-2-7)/2=-9/2=-4.5.

Since speed can't be negative, s=2.5 km/h.

Wait, so s=2
