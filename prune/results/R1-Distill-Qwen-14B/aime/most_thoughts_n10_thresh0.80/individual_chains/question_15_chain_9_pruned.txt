Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, and they have length 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right means moving only right or up. For an 8x8 grid, to get from the start to the end, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. So the total number of steps is 16, which matches the given path length.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, what does that mean? Changing direction would be when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. Each time you switch, that's a direction change. For example, if you go right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, that's three direction changes: right to up, up to right, right to up.

Wait, let me think. If you have a path with k direction changes, how does that relate to the number of segments you move in each direction? Each time you change direction, you add a new segment. So, if you change direction four times, how many segments do you have?

Let's see. Starting direction is right (assuming the first step is right; but actually, the first direction could be either right or up). Wait, but in this grid, you have to make exactly 8 right and 8 up moves, so the starting direction is either right or up.

Wait, but the problem says to go from lower left to upper right, which is the usual grid path problem. So, the starting step could be either right or up. But in terms of direction changes, how does that work?

Let me clarify. If I have a path starting with a right move, then changing direction to up, then maybe changing back to right, etc. Each change in direction increments the count. So, a path with four direction changes will have five segments. For example, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up. Wait, no, that's more than four changes.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the
