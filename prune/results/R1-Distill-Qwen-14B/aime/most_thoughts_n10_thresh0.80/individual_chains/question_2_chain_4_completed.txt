Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). They form a triangle or something? I need to find a point C on AB, not A or B, that isn't on any other segment from this family F except AB. Then find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

First, let me visualize this. O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway to 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher, around 0.866, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So AB is a line from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). I should probably find the equation of line AB.

To find the equation of AB, let me compute the slope. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + b. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b => b = sqrt(3)/2. So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, lying in the first quadrant. So each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is 1. So sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So each PQ is a segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive and satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1.

I need to find a point C on AB such that it's only on AB and no other PQ from F. So C should lie on AB but not on any other PQ in F except AB.

So, to find such a C, maybe I need to find the point where AB is tangent to some curve related to the family F. Because if a point is only on AB and not on any other PQ, it might mean that at that point, AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. Or perhaps it's the point where AB is the only PQ that passes through C.

Wait, what's the envelope of the family F? The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So if I can find the envelope of all these PQ segments, then the point C must lie on both AB and this envelope, and since it's unique, that must be the point.

So, how do I find the envelope of the family F? Let's consider the family of lines PQ: they are segments from (p,0) to (0,q) where p^2 + q^2 =1.

Each PQ can be represented by the equation x/p + y/q = 1, since it's a line intercepting x-axis at p and y-axis at q.

Given that p^2 + q^2 =1, so we can write q^2 =1 - p^2.

So, for each p, q is sqrt(1-p^2), but since p and q are positive, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2).

So the equation of each PQ is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve for p such that the line is tangent to the envelope. The envelope satisfies both the equation of the line and the derivative with respect to p set to zero.

So let me set up F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) - 1 = 0.

Then, the envelope is found by solving F(p, x, y) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

Compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = -x/p² + (y * (p / sqrt(1 - p²)²)) / (2*(1 - p²)^(3/2)) ).

Wait, actually, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) - 1.

So, dF/dp = derivative of x/p is -x/p².

Derivative of y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) is y * (1/(2*(1 - p²)^(3/2))) * (2p) = y*p / (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, dF/dp = -x/p² + (y p)/(1 - p²)^(3/2).

Set this equal to zero:

-x/p² + (y p)/(1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

So, (y p)/(1 - p²)^(3/2) = x/p².

Multiply both sides by p² (1 - p²)^(3/2):

y p^3 = x (1 - p²)^2.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to parameterize this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider parametrizing the family differently. Since p^2 + q^2 =1, perhaps using trigonometric substitution. Let p = cosθ, q = sinθ, where θ is in the first quadrant (since p and q are positive). Then each PQ is x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1.

Then, the equation is x secθ + y cscθ =1.

So, the envelope can be found by solving F(θ, x, y) = x secθ + y cscθ -1 =0 and dF/dθ =0.

Compute dF/dθ:

dF/dθ = x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ.

Set this equal to zero:

x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ =0.

So, x secθ tanθ = y cscθ cotθ.

Express everything in terms of sin and cos:

x (1/cosθ)(sinθ/cosθ) = y (1/sinθ)(cosθ/sinθ)

Simplify:

x (sinθ / cos²θ) = y (cosθ / sin²θ)

Multiply both sides by cos²θ sin²θ:

x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

So, x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

From the original equation, x secθ + y cscθ =1, which is x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1.

We can write x = (1 - y/sinθ) cosθ.

Substitute into x sin³θ = y cos³θ:

(1 - y/sinθ) cosθ * sin³θ = y cos³θ.

Let me expand this:

[ cosθ * sin³θ - (y/sinθ) cosθ * sin³θ ] = y cos³θ.

Simplify term by term:

First term: cosθ sin³θ.

Second term: - y cosθ sin²θ.

So,

cosθ sin³θ - y cosθ sin²θ = y cos³θ.

Bring all terms to one side:

cosθ sin³θ = y cosθ sin²θ + y cos³θ.

Factor out y cosθ on the right:

cosθ sin³θ = y cosθ (sin²θ + cos²θ).

But sin²θ + cos²θ =1, so:

cosθ sin³θ = y cosθ *1.

Divide both sides by cosθ (since cosθ ≠0 in first quadrant):

sin³θ = y.

So, y = sin³θ.

Now, from the original equation, x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1.

We have y = sin³θ, so:

x/cosθ + sin³θ / sinθ =1 => x/cosθ + sin²θ =1.

Thus, x/cosθ =1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So, x = cosθ * cos²θ = cos³θ.

So, the envelope is parametrized by θ as (cos³θ, sin³θ).

Wait, that's interesting. So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1. Because (cos³θ)^(2/3) + (sin³θ)^(2/3) = cos²θ + sin²θ =1.

Yes, that's correct. So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, to find point C on AB which is also on this envelope, but is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

Wait, but AB is one of the PQs in the family F, right? Because AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt{3}/2). Let's check if AB is in F.

So, AB has length sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt{3}/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4)=sqrt(1)=1. So yes, AB is in F.

So, AB is a member of F, and the point C is on AB and also on the envelope. But the envelope is tangent to each PQ, so the intersection point C of AB and the envelope is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

Hence, C is the point of tangency on AB.

So, to find C, we can solve for the intersection of AB and the envelope.

Equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Equation of envelope: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, substitute y from AB into the envelope equation:

x^(2/3) + (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) =1.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can parameterize this differently.

Alternatively, since the envelope is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, and AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, plug AB into the envelope:

x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.

Let me let t = x^(1/3). Then, x = t^3, so x^(2/3) = t^2.

Similarly, the other term: [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3)(-x + 1/2).

So, sqrt(3)(-x + 1/2) = sqrt(3)( -t^3 + 1/2 ).

So, [sqrt(3)( -t^3 + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3) = [ sqrt(3) ]^(2/3) * (-t^3 + 1/2 )^(2/3).

sqrt(3) is 3^(1/2), so [3^(1/2)]^(2/3) = 3^(1/3).

So, the equation becomes:

t^2 + 3^(1/3) * (-t^3 + 1/2 )^(2/3) =1.

Hmm, maybe this isn't helpful. Maybe another substitution.

Wait, perhaps since both the envelope and AB are known, I can find their intersection by solving the equations.

Let me let u = x^(1/3), v = y^(1/3). Then, the envelope equation is u^2 + v^2 =1.

But AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, in terms of u and v:

v^3 = -sqrt(3) u^3 + sqrt(3)/2.

So, v^3 + sqrt(3) u^3 = sqrt(3)/2.

But since u^2 + v^2 =1, perhaps I can find u and v that satisfy both.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize u and v.

Wait, this might not be the easiest path. Let me try another approach.

Parametrize AB. Since AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), we can write any point on AB as (1/2 - t/2, 0 + t*sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to1. So, when t=0, it's A, t=1, it's B.

So, point C can be written as ( (1 - t)/2 , t*sqrt(3)/2 ), where t is between 0 and1. We need to find t such that this point lies on the envelope x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, substituting:

[ (1 - t)/2 ]^(2/3) + [ (t sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) =1.

Compute each term.

First term: [ (1 - t)/2 ]^(2/3) = [ (1 - t) ]^(2/3) / 2^(2/3).

Second term: [ (t sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = [ t^2 * 3 /4 ]^(1/3) = (t^2 * 3/4)^(1/3) = (3/4)^(1/3) * t^(2/3).

Wait, no: [a*b]^(2/3) = a^(2/3)*b^(2/3). So, [t sqrt(3)/2]^(2/3) = [t]^(2/3) * [sqrt(3)/2]^(2/3).

Compute [sqrt(3)/2]^(2/3):

sqrt(3) is 3^(1/2), so [3^(1/2)/2]^(2/3) = 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3).

So, the second term is t^(2/3) * 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3).

So, putting it all together:

[ (1 - t)^(2/3) ] / 2^(2/3) + [ t^(2/3) * 3^(1/3) ] / 2^(2/3) =1.

Factor out 1/2^(2/3):

[ (1 - t)^(2/3) + t^(2/3) *3^(1/3) ] / 2^(2/3) =1.

Multiply both sides by 2^(2/3):

(1 - t)^(2/3) + t^(2/3) *3^(1/3) = 2^(2/3).

Hmm, this is still a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.

Let me denote s = t^(1/3), so t = s^3.

Then, (1 - t)^(2/3) = (1 - s^3)^(2/3).

But 1 - s^3 = (1 - s)(1 + s + s^2). Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let me make a substitution to simplify the exponents. Let me set u = t^(1/3), so t = u^3.

Then, 1 - t = 1 - u^3.

So, (1 - t)^(2/3) = (1 - u^3)^(2/3) = ( (1 - u)(1 + u + u^2) )^(2/3).

Hmm, not helpful either.

Alternatively, perhaps let me raise both sides to the power of 3 to eliminate the roots.

But wait, the equation is:

(1 - t)^(2/3) + (3^(1/3)) t^(2/3) = 2^(2/3).

Let me denote A = (1 - t)^(2/3) and B = (3^(1/3)) t^(2/3).

So, A + B = 2^(2/3).

I can cube both sides:

(A + B)^3 = (2^(2/3))^3 = 2^2 =4.

But expanding (A + B)^3 is messy, but let's try.

(A + B)^3 = A^3 + B^3 + 3AB(A + B).

So,

A^3 + B^3 + 3AB(A + B) =4.

But A = (1 - t)^(2/3), so A^3 = (1 - t)^2.

Similarly, B = 3^(1/3) t^(2/3), so B^3 = 3 t^2.

Also, AB = (1 - t)^(2/3) * 3^(1/3) t^(2/3) = 3^(1/3) (1 - t)^(2/3) t^(2/3).

So,

(1 - t)^2 + 3 t^2 + 3 * 3^(1/3) (1 - t)^(2/3) t^(2/3) (A + B) =4.

But A + B =2^(2/3), so:

(1 - t)^2 + 3 t^2 + 3 * 3^(1/3) (1 - t)^(2/3) t^(2/3) *2^(2/3) =4.

Simplify the third term:

3 * 3^(1/3) *2^(2/3) =3 * (3^(1/3) * 2^(2/3)).

Note that 3^(1/3) * 2^(2/3) = (3 * 2^2)^(1/3) = (12)^(1/3).

So, 3 * 12^(1/3) = 3 * (12)^(1/3).

But 12^(1/3) = (8*1.5)^(1/3) = 2 * 1.5^(1/3). Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps compute numerically.

Wait, maybe this approach is not the best. Maybe it's better to consider that point C is the intersection point of AB and the envelope, which is the astroid.

We can parametrize the astroid as x = cos^3θ, y = sin^3θ. So, for some θ, the point (cos^3θ, sin^3θ) lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, sin^3θ = -sqrt(3) cos^3θ + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me write this as:

sin^3θ + sqrt(3) cos^3θ = sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, perhaps express this in terms of sinθ and cosθ.

Let me factor out cos^3θ:

cos^3θ ( tan^3θ + sqrt(3) ) = sqrt(3)/2.

But tanθ = sinθ / cosθ, so tan^3θ = (sinθ)^3 / (cosθ)^3.

Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let me write everything in terms of sinθ.

We have sin^3θ + sqrt(3) cos^3θ = sqrt(3)/2.

Express cos^3θ as (1 - sin^2θ)^(3/2). Wait, that could complicate things.

Alternatively, divide both sides by cos^3θ:

tan^3θ + sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3)/2) / cos^3θ.

Not helpful either.

Wait, maybe I can write the equation as:

sin^3θ + sqrt(3) cos^3θ = sqrt(3)/2.

Let me factor out cos^3θ:

cos^3θ ( tan^3θ + sqrt(3) ) = sqrt(3)/2.

But tanθ is sinθ / cosθ, so tan^3θ = (sinθ)^3 / (cosθ)^3.

Not sure.

Alternatively, let me suppose that sinθ = a, cosθ = b, so a^2 + b^2 =1.

Then, equation becomes a^3 + sqrt(3) b^3 = sqrt(3)/2.

Let me try to solve this equation.

Let me denote k = a^3 + sqrt(3) b^3 = sqrt(3)/2.

We have a^2 + b^2 =1.

Hmm, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe let me assume that a and b are proportional to some constants.

Wait, maybe suppose that a = m b, where m is a constant.

Then, substituting into a^2 + b^2 =1: (m^2 +1) b^2 =1 => b = 1/sqrt(m^2 +1), a= m/sqrt(m^2 +1).

Substitute into the equation:

(m/sqrt(m^2 +1))^3 + sqrt(3)*(1/sqrt(m^2 +1))^3 = sqrt(3)/2.

Factor out 1/(m^2 +1)^(3/2):

[ m^3 + sqrt(3) ] / (m^2 +1)^(3/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

So,

[ m^3 + sqrt(3) ] = (sqrt(3)/2) (m^2 +1)^(3/2).

This seems complicated, but maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

So,

( m^3 + sqrt(3) )^2 = (3/4) (m^2 +1)^3.

Expand the left side:

m^6 + 2 m^3 sqrt(3) + 3 = (3/4)(m^6 + 3 m^4 + 3 m^2 +1).

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:

4 m^6 + 8 m^3 sqrt(3) +12 = 3 m^6 +9 m^4 +9 m^2 +3.

Bring all terms to the left:

4 m^6 -3 m^6 +8 m^3 sqrt(3) -9 m^4 -9 m^2 +12 -3 =0.

Simplify:

m^6 -9 m^4 -9 m^2 +8 m^3 sqrt(3) +9=0.

Hmm, this is a sixth-degree equation in m, which is probably difficult to solve. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Maybe let me set m = tanθ, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let m = sqrt(3), but plugging in:

m = sqrt(3): LHS = (sqrt(3))^3 + sqrt(3) = 3 sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) =4 sqrt(3). RHS is (sqrt(3)/2)*( (3 +1)^(3/2) )= (sqrt(3)/2)*(4)^(3/2)= (sqrt(3)/2)*(8)=4 sqrt(3). So, LHS=RHS.

Wait, so when m = sqrt(3), the equation holds. So, a = m b = sqrt(3) b.

But from a^2 + b^2 =1,

(3 b^2) + b^2 =1 =>4 b^2=1 =>b=1/2, so a= sqrt(3)/2.

Thus, sinθ = a= sqrt(3)/2, cosθ=1/2.

Which corresponds to θ=60 degrees, or π/3 radians.

So, θ=π/3.

So, point C on the astroid is (cos^3θ, sin^3θ) = ( (1/2)^3 , (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) = (1/8, (3 sqrt(3))/8 ).

Wait, let me compute that.

cos(π/3)=1/2, so cos^3(π/3)= (1/2)^3=1/8.

sin(π/3)=sqrt(3)/2, so sin^3(π/3)= (sqrt(3)/2)^3= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Now, check if this point lies on AB.

Equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Plug in x=1/8:

y= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8 )= 3 sqrt(3)/8.

Which matches the y-coordinate of C. So, yes, C is on AB.

Therefore, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Now, compute OC^2: since O is (0,0), OC^2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.

Calculate each term:

(1/8)^2 =1/64.

(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =9*3 /64=27/64.

So, OC^2=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

So, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

Wait, but before I conclude, let me just make sure that this point C is indeed the only point on AB that is not on any other PQ in F. Since it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, which is the astroid, and the envelope is the boundary of the family F, so beyond this point, any other PQ would not pass through C. So, C is unique in that sense.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=23.


To solve the problem, we first determine the equation of the line segment $\overline{AB}$. Points $A$ and $B$ are given as $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$ and $\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$, respectively. The slope of $\overline{AB}$ is calculated as $-\sqrt{3}$, leading to the equation $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Next, we consider the family $\mathcal{F}$ of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length, where $P$ is on the $x$-axis and $Q$ is on the $y$-axis. Each segment $\overline{PQ}$ can be represented by the equation $\frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1$ with $p^2 + q^2 = 1$. The envelope of this family forms an astroid given by $x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1$.

To find the unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$ that lies on the astroid, we substitute the equation of $\overline{AB}$ into the astroid's equation. Solving the resulting equation, we find that the point $C$ corresponds to $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$ on the astroid, giving coordinates $\left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)$.

Finally, we calculate $OC^2$ as the square of the distance from the origin to $C$:

\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]

Thus, $p = 7$ and $q = 16$, leading to $p + q = 23$.

$\boxed{23}$
