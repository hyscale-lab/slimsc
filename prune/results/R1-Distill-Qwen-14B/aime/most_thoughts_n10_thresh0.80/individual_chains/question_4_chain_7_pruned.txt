Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make Bob the winner, assuming he plays optimally.

Hmm, I think this is a classic game theory problem. It probably involves finding the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a winning position is one where the current player can force a win.

Let me try to model this. Let's define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L) for the player whose turn it is.

Base case: when n=0, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So, n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't move. Wait, no. Wait, n=0 is when there are no tokens left. So if it's your turn and n=0, you lose because you can't make a move. So, n=0 is a losing position (L).

Let me start from small n and see the pattern.

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So W.
n=2: Take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can take it and win. Wait, but wait, the opponent can take 1 and win. So if I take 1, the opponent takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, because n=2, I can't take 4. So my only option is to take 1, which leads to the opponent winning. So n=2 is L.
n=3: I can take 1, leaving 2 for the opponent, which is a losing position for them. So if I take 1, opponent gets n=2 (L), meaning I win. So n=3 is W.
n=4: I can take 4 and win immediately. So W.
n=5: Let's see. If I take 1, opponent gets n=4, which is W, so opponent can win. If I take 4, opponent gets n=1, which is W. So no matter what I do, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.
n=6: Take 1, leaving n=5, which is L. So opponent is in losing position. Therefore, n=6 is W.
n=7: Take 1, opponent gets n=6 (W). Or take 4, opponent gets n=3 (W). So regardless, opponent can win. So n=7 is L.
n=8: Take 4, leaving n=4 (W). Wait, but opponent can take 4 again and win. Wait, no, if I take 4 from 8, it's 4, opponent can take 4 and win. Hmm. Alternatively, take 1 from 8, leaving 7 (L). So if I take 1, opponent is left with n=7 (L). So n=8 is W.
n=9: Let's see. Take 1, leaving 8 (W). Take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if I take 4, opponent is left with 5 (L). So n=9 is W.
Wait, wait, if I take 4 from 9, opponent gets 5. If 5 is L, then opponent is in a losing position, so I can win. So n=9 is W. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

n=5: If I take 1, opponent gets 4 (W). If I take 4, opponent gets 1 (W). So n=5 is L.

n=6: If I take 1, opponent gets 5 (L). So n=6 is W.

n=7: Taking 1 leaves 6 (W), taking 4 leaves 3 (W). So n=7 is L.

n=8: Taking 1 leaves
