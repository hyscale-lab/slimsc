Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, Alice picks a set A. Then Bob considers all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such B's is 2024. Our goal is to find the sum of the elements in A.

Wait, so first, I think I need to figure out how the number of such sets B relates to the set A. Let's think about what B can be.

Each B is a finite non-empty set of positive integers, and its maximum is in A. So, for each element m in A, how many sets B are there where the maximum is m?

Well, if the maximum is m, then the other elements of B must be less than or equal to m. But since B is a set, the elements are unique, so all elements are positive integers less than m, and then m itself.

So for each m in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum m is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, each combined with the element m. But wait, since B is non-empty, the subsets can't be empty. Wait, no, because if we take a subset of {1,2,...,m-1}, which could be empty, and then add m, the set B would be either {m} (if the subset is empty) or something else. So, actually, the number of possible subsets is 2^{m-1}, because each element from 1 to m-1 can be either included or excluded.

But wait, hold on. For each m, the number of sets B with maximum m is 2^{m-1}, because each element less than m can be either present or not. So the total number of such sets is the sum over all m in A of 2^{m-1}.

But wait, let's check an example. Suppose A = {1}. Then the only set B is {1}, so the count is 1. Plugging into the formula, 2^{1-1} =
