Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.

We have 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips. The task is to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid. The conditions are:

1. Each cell can contain at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, any extra chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

And we need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

First, since each row must have chips of the same color, each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must have chips of the same color or be empty. But wait, the second condition says all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color. So, each row can have either all white, all black, or no chips. The same goes for each column.

But wait, if a row has chips, then all the chips in that row are the same color. But if a column also has chips, all of them must be the same color. So, the color of the row and the color of the column must be consistent where they intersect, right?

So, suppose I have a grid where some rows are white, some are black, and the rest are empty. Similarly, some columns are white, some are black, and the rest are empty.

But when a white row intersects with a white column, that cell must have a white chip. Similarly, a black row and black column must have a black chip. But if a white row and black column intersect, that cell can't have a chip because it's conflicting in color. Therefore, such a cell must be empty.

Wait, but the problem allows for some cells to be empty. So, the grid must be arranged in such a way that each row and each column is either all white, all black, or empty. But with the additional constraint that any additional chip would violate the conditions.

Wait, the third condition says that any additional chip would violate the previous two conditions. So, the grid is maximally filled; you can't add any more chips without violating
