Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find out how many residents of Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me list out the given data to make sure I understand everything correctly.

Total residents: 900.

Number of residents owning each item:
- Diamond ring (D): 195
- Golf clubs (G): 367
- Garden spade (S): 562
- Candy hearts (C): Well, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So that means everyone owns C, right? So the number for C is 900.

But wait, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. It says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So yes, C is 900. Got it.

Then, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. We need to find the number of residents who own all four.

Hmm, okay. This seems like a problem involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion can help find the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering all possible intersections.

But wait, here we have four sets: D, G, S, and C. But C is universal because everyone owns it. So every resident has C, so when we're looking at the intersections, C is always included. Interesting.

But let me think. We have four items, but C is owned by everyone, so any combination of the other three items could include or exclude C? No, actually, since everyone has C, any time someone owns any of the other items, they automatically have C as well. So, the ownership of D, G, or S implies ownership of C. Wait, but the problem says "exactly two" or "exactly three." So, how does that affect things?

Wait a second, the problem specifies that each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts, so C is universal. So, when they talk about owning exactly two or three things, does that include C or not?

Hmm, this is a crucial point. Let me read the problem again.

It says, "437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." The "these things" probably refers to the four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, exactly two or exactly three includes candy hearts.

Wait, but candy hearts are owned by everyone, so if someone owns exactly two things, one of them must be C, right? Because they already have C. So, for someone to own exactly two, they must have C plus one other. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three must have C plus two others.

Ah, so that's the key. So, the counts of exactly two and exactly three are based on all four items, including C. So, when they say "exactly two," it's two out of the four, but since C is always
