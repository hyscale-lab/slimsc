Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Hmm, the term is a bit unusual, but I think I can figure it out by breaking down the definition.

Alright, the problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. Oh, and there's an example given: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_13. Then, 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.

So the task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. That means I need to find the smallest base b such that there are over ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.

Let me try to formalize this. When a number n is expressed in base b with exactly two digits, that means n can be written as:

n = a * b + c

where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and c must be less than b. So, 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. So,

a + c = sqrt(n)

But wait, n is equal to a*b + c, so substituting that in, we have:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let me rearrange the equation:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms to group like terms together:

a² - a*b + 2ac + c² - c = 0

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor out terms involving a and c:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Hmm, perhaps think of this as a quadratic equation in terms of a or c. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this as:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Maybe group terms:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

Yes, that looks like a quadratic in a. So, for given b, c, we can solve for a. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, but a and c are digits in base b, so a and c have to be integers between 0 and b-1, with a ≥ 1.

So for each base b, I can iterate over possible values of a and c, check if a + c equals sqrt(a*b + c), and count how many such numbers n exist.

But since I need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds ten, maybe I can find a formula or pattern that allows me to compute the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b without enumerating all possibilities, which might be time-consuming.

Let me try to write the equation again:

Let n = a*b + c, and a + c = sqrt(n).

So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me denote s = a + c. So s = sqrt(n), which means n = s².

Therefore, s² = a*b + c.

But since a = s - c, substituting:

s² = (s - c)*b + c

s² = s*b - c*b + c

Let me rearrange terms:

s² - s*b = -c*b + c

Factor the right side:

s² - s*b = c*(-b + 1)

But s² - s*b is also equal to s(s - b)

So,

s(s - b) = c*(1 - b)

Hmm, interesting. Let's write it as:

s(s - b) = c*(1 - b)

We can factor out a negative sign:

s(s - b) = -c*(b - 1)

Multiply both sides by -1:

s(b - s) = c*(b - 1)

So,

s(b - s) = c*(b - 1)

That's an interesting equation. Let me note that s is a + c, and since a and c are digits in base b, their sum s has to be at least 1 (since a ≥ 1) and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.

But since n = s², and n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be less than b². So s² < b², which implies s < b.

Therefore, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s < b.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b and b² - 1. So,
