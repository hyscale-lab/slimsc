Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be expressed in polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can write \( z = 4 e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That makes sense because the modulus is 4, so the magnitude is fixed, and the angle can vary to give different complex numbers on the circle with radius 4.

So, substituting \( z = 4 e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's compute each part separately. Let's first compute \( (75 + 117i)z \). 

Calculating that:
\[
(75 + 117i) \times 4 e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i) e^{i\theta}
\]
Wait, 4 times (75 + 117i) is 300 + 468i. So, that part is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Now, the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Since \( z = 4 e^{i\theta} \), its reciprocal is \( \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \). So the second term becomes:
\[
(96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
Putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:
\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
Hmm, maybe I can combine these terms using Euler's formula. Remember, \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, let me expand both terms:
1. \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
2. \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me compute each part separately.

Starting with the first term:
\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Multiply using distributive property:
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
Since \( i^2 = -1 \):
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Group real and imaginary parts:
Real: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i

Similarly, compute the second term:
\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
Multiply:
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
Again, \( i^2 = -1 \):
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Group real and imaginary parts:
Real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

Now, adding both terms together:
Real parts: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So, the entire expression is:
(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)i

But the problem asks for the real part of this expression. So, the real part is:
324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

I need to maximize this expression with respect to θ. So, the goal is to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Wait, this is a linear combination of sine and cosine. I remember that expressions of the form \( A \cosθ + B \sinθ \) can be rewritten as \( C \cos(θ + φ) \) or \( C \sin(θ + φ) \), where \( C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). The maximum value of such an expression is \( C \), so the maximum real part should be \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \( 324^2 \):
324 * 324. Let me think, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and the cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400. So total is (300 + 24)^2 = 324^2 = 104,976.

Then, (-432)^2 is 432^2. Let's compute 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So 432^2 = (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, sum of squares: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

Square root of 291,600 is... Let me see, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2 is 250,000, 40^2 is 1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, 500+40=540, 540^2=291,600. So, C = 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = 540. So the maximum value is R, which is 540.

Alternatively, I could have used calculus. Let me think about that approach to confirm.

Suppose f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

To find its maximum, take derivative with respect to θ:

f’(θ) = -324 sinθ - 432 cosθ

Set derivative to zero:

-324 sinθ -432 cosθ = 0

=> 324 sinθ + 432 cosθ = 0

Divide both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠ 0):

324 tanθ + 432 = 0

tanθ = -432 / 324 = -4/3

So, θ = arctan(-4/3). Hmm, so θ is in the fourth or second quadrant.

But since tan is periodic with π, the solutions are θ = arctan(-4/3) + kπ.

To find the maximum, we can plug back into f(θ). Alternatively, using the method of expressing as R cos(theta + phi), which gives the maximum as R.

So, both methods lead to the same conclusion that the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me recap:

- Expressed z as 4 e^{i theta}

- Expanded the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 +144i)/z

- Calculated each term, converted to cos and sin terms

- Summed real parts and found 324 cosθ -432 sinθ

- Noted that the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A^2 + B^2)

- Calculated A^2 + B^2 = (324)^2 + (432)^2 = 104,976 +186,624=291,600

- sqrt(291,600)=540

So, yes, that seems correct.

I think that's solid. So, the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form: \(z = 4 e^{i\theta}\). Substituting this into the expression, we compute each term separately.

First, expand \((75 + 117i)z\):
\[
(75 + 117i) \times 4 e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}
\]
This becomes:
\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i
\]

Next, expand \(\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\):
\[
(96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
This becomes:
\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i
\]

Adding the real parts and imaginary parts separately, the real part of the entire expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

To maximize this expression, we recognize it as a linear combination of \(\cos\theta\) and \(\sin\theta\). The maximum value is given by the magnitude:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
