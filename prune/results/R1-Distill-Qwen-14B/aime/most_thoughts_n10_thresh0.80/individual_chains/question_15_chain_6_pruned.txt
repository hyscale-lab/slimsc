Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths have to be of length 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so moving from the lower left to the upper right would require 8 right and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. The condition is that the path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to count these paths.

First, I should clarify what it means to change direction. In a grid path, you can only move either right or up at each step. So a change in direction happens when you switch from moving right to moving up or vice versa. For example, if you start by moving right, then up, then right again, that's two direction changes.

Wait, so each time the movement switches from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So if a path has exactly four direction changes, how does that translate into segments of right and up moves?

Let me think: If a path changes direction four times, how many segments of each direction does it have? Well, each direction change alternates between right and up. So starting from right, the path would go right, then up, then right, then up, etc., each time changing direction. So the number of segments would be direction changes + 1. So for four changes, that would be five segments.

Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think carefully. Suppose a path starts with a right move. Then, if it changes direction once, it'll have two segments: right and up. Changing direction twice would give three segments: right, up, right. So yeah, each direction change adds a new segment. Therefore, four direction changes would result in five segments.

But wait, the total number of direction changes is four, so the number of segments is five. Now, these segments alternate between right and up moves. So, depending on whether the path starts with a right or up move, the segments alternate accordingly.

But in our case, moving from the lower left to the upper right, you have to make 8 right moves and 8 up moves. So the total number of right moves is 8 and up moves is 8. Now, our path is divided into five segments (since four direction changes) that alternate between right and up. So, how are these segments distributed?

If the path starts with a right move, the segments would be: right, up, right, up, right. So that's three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if it starts with an up move, the segments would be up, right, up, right, up, which would be three up segments and two right segments. But wait, since we have to make 8 right and 8 up moves, we need to see which starting direction allows the segments to sum up correctly.

Wait, but in the case where the path starts with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. So that's three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, starting with up would give three up segments and two right segments.

But in both cases, the number of right and up segments differ. However, in our problem, we have exactly 8 right and 8 up moves. So let's think
