Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let's see.

First, all variables x, y, z are positive real numbers, which is good because logs are defined for positive numbers. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

I need to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. Let me try to solve for x, y, z first using the given equations.

I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in terms of log x, log y, log z.

Let me denote:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

Then, the equations become:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = log₂ x - log₂ y - log₂ z = a - b - c = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = log₂ y - log₂ x - log₂ z = b - a - c = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = log₂ z - log₂ x - log₂ y = c - a - b = 1/4

So now, I have a system of three equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2  ...(1)
2. -a + b - c = 1/3 ...(2)
3. -a - b + c = 1/4 ...(3)

Hmm, let's write these equations clearly:

Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2

Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let's try to add equations or manipulate them.

If I add equations (1) and (2):

(1)+(2): (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Which simplifies to: 0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6 (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 =5/6)

So, -2c =5/6 → c = -5/(12)

Wait, hold on, c is log₂ z, which is a real number, but negative. Since z is positive, log can be negative. That's okay.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's plug c into another equation. Let's take equation (1):

a - b - (-5/12) = 1/2 → a - b +5/12 =1/2

So, a - b = 1/2 -5/12 = (6/12 -5/12) =1/12 → a - b =1/12 ...(4)

Similarly, take equation (2):

- a + b - (-5/12) =1/3 → -a + b +5/12 =1/3

So, -a + b =1/3 -5/12 = (4/12 -5/12)= -1/12 → -a + b = -1/12 ...(5)

Now, equations (4) and (5):

(4): a - b =1/12

(5): -a + b = -1/12

If I add (4) and (5):

(a -a) + (-b +b) =1/12 -1/12 → 0=0. Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe I can solve for a or b.

From (4): a = b +1/12

Plugging into (5):

-(b +1/12) + b = -1/12 → -b -1/12 + b = -1/12 → -1/12 = -1/12. Well, that's an identity, so it doesn't give new info.

So perhaps I need to use equation (3). Let's recall equation (3):

- a - b + c =1/4

We know c is -5/12, so:

- a - b -5/12 =1/4 → -a -b =1/4 +5/12 = 3/12 +5/12=8/12=2/3

So, -a - b =2/3 → a + b= -2/3 ...(6)

But from equation (4): a = b +1/12. Plugging into equation (6):

(b +1/12) + b = -2/3 → 2b +1/12 = -2/3

Subtract 1/12: 2b = -2/3 -1/12 = (-8/12 -1/12)= -9/12= -3/4

So, 2b = -3/4 → b= -3/8

Then from equation (4): a = b +1/12= (-3/8) +1/12

Convert to common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24, and 1/12=2/24. So a= (-9/24 +2/24)= (-7)/24

So a = -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.

So, let me recap:

a = log₂ x = -7/24 → x=2^(-7/24)

b = log₂ y = -3/8 → y=2^(-3/8)

c = log₂ z = -5/12 → z=2^(-5/12)

Wait, but I need to compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²). Let me write that in terms of a, b, c.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) =4 log₂ x +3 log₂ y +2 log₂ z =4a +3b +2c

So plugging a, b, c:

4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)

Calculate each term:

4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6

3*(-3/8)= -9/8

2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6

Now add them together:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, find a common denominator, which is 24.

Convert each term:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8= -27/24

-5/6= -20/24

Adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24= (-75)/24= -25/8

So, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8.

But the problem asks for the absolute value: |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| = | -25/8 | =25/8

25 and 8 are coprime, so m=25, n=8. Thus m+n=33.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because I don't want to make a mistake.

Let me re-calculate 4a +3b +2c:

a= -7/24, so 4a=4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6.

b= -3/8, so 3b=3*(-3/8)= -9/8.

c= -5/12, so 2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6.

So, 4a +3b +2c= -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

Combine the fractions:

First, combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7 -5)/6= -12/6= -2.

So now, -2 -9/8.

Convert to eighths: -2 is -16/8.

So, -16/8 -9/8= -25/8. Yes, correct.

So absolute value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8. They are coprime, so m+n=33.

I think that's correct.


To solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into a system of linear equations using logarithms. Let \( a = \log_2 x \), \( b = \log_2 y \), and \( c = \log_2 z \). The equations become:

1. \( a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} \)
2. \( -a + b - c = \frac{1}{3} \)
3. \( -a - b + c = \frac{1}{4} \)

Adding equations (1) and (2), we get:
\[
-2c = \frac{5}{6} \implies c = -\frac{5}{12}
\]

Next, substituting \( c = -\frac{5}{12} \) into equations (1) and (2), we find:
\[
a - b = \frac{1}{12} \quad \text{(from equation 1)}
\]
\[
-a + b = -\frac{1}{12} \quad \text{(from equation 2)}
\]

From these, we determine that \( a = b + \frac{1}{12} \). Substituting this into equation (3):
\[
-a - b - \frac{5}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \implies -a - b = \frac{2}{3} \implies a + b = -\frac{2}{3}
\]

Substituting \( a = b + \frac{1}{12} \) into \( a + b = -\frac{2}{3} \):
\[
2b + \frac{1}{12} = -\frac{2}{3} \implies 2b = -\frac{3}{4} \implies b = -\frac{3}{8}
\]
\[
a = b + \frac{1}{12} = -\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{12} = -\frac{7}{24}
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
a = -\frac{7}{24}, \quad b = -\frac{3}{8}, \quad c = -\frac{5}{12}
\]

We need to find \( \left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| \). Using the properties of logarithms:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]
Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
4 \left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3 \left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2 \left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}
\]
Converting to a common denominator (24):
\[
-\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]
Taking the absolute value:
\[
\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]
Thus, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), giving \( m + n = 33 \).

\boxed{33}
