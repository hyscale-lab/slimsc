Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. So, it's a 12-sided polygon with each side the same and each angle the same. The problem is about finding rectangles inside this shape, where the sides of the rectangles are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, so rectangles must have their sides aligned with the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. That means the sides of the rectangle can't just be any random lines; they have to coincide with the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon. Interesting.

I think the key here is to figure out how these rectangles can be formed. Since a rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees, I need to find sets of four points in the dodecagon where the sides are either sides or diagonals, and they meet at right angles.

Maybe I should start by considering the symmetry of the dodecagon. It has rotational symmetry, so perhaps the number of rectangles can be found by considering how many unique rectangles exist in one section and then multiplying by the number of sections?

Wait, but the dodecagon is regular, so all sides and angles are the same. Maybe I can model this using coordinates or vectors. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices of the dodecagon.

If I place the dodecagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin, each vertex can be represented as a point on the unit circle. The angle between each vertex would be 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, the coordinates of the vertices would be (cos(k*30°), sin(k*30°)) for k from 0 to 11.

So, vertex 0 is at (1,0), vertex 1 is at (cos(30°), sin(30°)), vertex 2 at (cos(60°), sin(60°)), and so on, up to vertex 11.

Now, any side or diagonal of the dodecagon connects two vertices. So, sides connect consecutive vertices, like from vertex k to vertex k+1 (mod 12). Diagonals connect vertices that are further apart, like vertex k to vertex k+2, k+3, etc.

So, the sides of the rectangle must be either sides or diagonals. That means, for a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides, each pair being the same length, and the angles between the sides must be 90 degrees.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals have specific lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. So, the length of a side is the same as the chord length between two adjacent vertices. The diagonals will have different lengths depending on how many steps apart the vertices are.

So, perhaps the first step is to figure out the possible lengths of sides and diagonals in the dodecagon.

The chord length can be calculated using the formula: chord length = 2 * R * sin(π * k / n), where R is the radius, n is the number of sides, and k is the number of steps between the vertices.

Since I can assume the dodecagon is unit radius (for simplicity), so R = 1. So, chord length for step k is 2 * sin(π * k / 12). Let's compute these for k = 1, 2, ..., 6.

For k=1: 2 sin(π/12) ≈ 0.5176

k=2: 2 sin(2π/12) = 2 sin(π/6) = 2*(1/2)=1

k=3: 2 sin(3π/12) = 2 sin(π/4) ≈ 1.4142

k=4: 2 sin(4π/12) = 2 sin(π/3) ≈ 1.732

k=5: 2 sin(5π/12) ≈ 1.93185

k=6: 2 sin(6π/12) = 2 sin(π/2) = 2*1=2

Wait, so the possible lengths for sides and diagonals are these values. So, the sides of the dodecagon are length ≈0.5176, and the diagonals can be longer, up to 2 units.

But how does this help me? Well, the sides of the rectangle must be either of these lengths, and the angles between them must be 90 degrees.

In a regular dodecagon, the angle between two consecutive vertices from the center is 30 degrees. So, the angle between two non-consecutive vertices (a diagonal) would be a multiple of 30 degrees.

But wait, for a rectangle, the sides must be perpendicular to each other. So, the angle between the sides of the rectangle must be 90 degrees. In the dodecagon, the central angles between two lines (sides or diagonals) must correspond to a right angle.

Wait, but the central angle between two lines is the angle between their respective radii. So, if I have two lines from the center connecting to two different vertices, the angle between them is 30°, 60°, 90°, etc., depending on how many vertices apart they are.

So, for the sides of the rectangle to be perpendicular, the central angles corresponding to those sides must add up to 90 degrees? Or wait, maybe not exactly, because the sides themselves can be at different angles.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe another approach is needed.

Let me think about the diagonals. In a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed by selecting four vertices such that their connecting lines are sides or diagonals, and they form a rectangle.

Wait, but the sides of the rectangle must lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, but not necessarily a side of the polygon.

Hmm, so perhaps the rectangle is formed by four points on the dodecagon, such that each side of the rectangle is a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

Wait, but in that case, the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon.

Alternatively, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are edges (sides or diagonals) of the dodecagon's edges or diagonals.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the grid formed by the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a circle, and then the sides and diagonals are chords of the circle.

So, if I can find four chords that form a rectangle, with each pair of opposite sides being equal and the sides meeting at right angles, that would form a rectangle inside the dodecagon.

But how do I find such rectangles?

I remember that in a circle, a rectangle inscribed in the circle must have its diagonals equal to the diameter. But wait, in this case, the rectangle isn't inscribed in the circle, but its sides are chords of the circle. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle's sides are aligned such that their corresponding central angles are 90 degrees apart.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of vectors. Each side or diagonal of the dodecagon can be represented as a vector from the center to a vertex, but perhaps it's getting too abstract.

Wait, maybe
