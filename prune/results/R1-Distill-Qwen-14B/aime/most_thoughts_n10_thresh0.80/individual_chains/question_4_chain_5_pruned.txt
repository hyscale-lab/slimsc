Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this seems like a classic game theory problem, probably involving finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Let me start by trying to model the game for small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's create a table where for each n, I determine if it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n | Winner
1 | Alice takes 1 and wins. So W.
2 | Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, but wait, if Alice takes 1 from n=2, Bob is left with 1, so Bob can take it and win. But that would mean Alice loses. So is n=2 a losing position for Alice? Wait, no, because Alice goes first, so if she takes 1, Bob gets 1 and wins. So for n=2, Alice can't win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this confused.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me think about each n and see whether the current player can force a win.

For n=1: current player takes 1 and wins. So W.
n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So current player can't force a win; opponent will win. So n=2 is L.
Wait, but maybe the current player can take 1, but that leaves 1 for the opponent, who takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So if n=2 is the current state, the current player can't force a win. So n=2 is L.

n=3: Current player can take 1, leaving 2 (which is L for the opponent), so opponent is in a losing position. So n=3 is W.
n=4: Current player can take 4 and win immediately. So W.
n=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is a W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is W for the opponent. So both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So n=5 is L.
Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, for n=5, if the current player takes 1, leaving 4. Since n=4 is W, the opponent can take 4 and win. Alternatively, if current player takes 4, leaving 1, which is W for the opponent. So yes, n=5 is L, because no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win.

n=6: Let
