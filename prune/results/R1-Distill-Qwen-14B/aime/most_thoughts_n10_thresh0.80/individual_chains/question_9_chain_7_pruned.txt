Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem says that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write this down to get a clearer picture.

First, let me translate the logarithmic equations into exponential form because that might make it easier to handle. So, the first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here, I get x^10 = y^x. That's one equation.

The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logic, that would mean y^10 = x^{4y}. So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay, so I have x and y in each other's exponents. This seems a bit tricky, but maybe I can find a relationship between x and y.

Let me see. From the first equation, x^10 = y^x. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponents. Taking ln on both sides:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to 10 ln x = x ln y. Let me write that as equation (1):

10 ln x = x ln y. — (1)

Similarly, for the second equation, y^10 = x^{4y}. Taking ln again:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which gives 10 ln y = 4y ln x. Let's write that as equation (2):

10 ln y = 4y ln x. — (2)

Now I have two equations with ln x and ln y. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other.

From equation (1): 10 ln x = x ln y. Let's solve for ln y:

ln y = (10 ln x) / x. — (1a)

From equation (2): 10 ln y = 4y ln x. Let's substitute ln y from (1a) into this equation.

So, substituting, 10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

Simplify the left side: 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by ln x, assuming ln x is not zero. Since x > 1, ln x is positive, so it's safe to divide.

So, 100 / x = 4y.

Multiply both sides by x: 100 = 4y x.

Divide both sides by 4: y x = 25.

Wait, that's great! So, xy = 25. That's the product we were supposed to find. Hmm, did I do that correctly?

Let me double-check the substitutions.

From equation (1a), ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

Plugging into equation (2): 10*(10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

So that's 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Divide both sides by ln x: 100 / x = 4y.

Which gives x * y = 100 / 4 = 25.

Yes, that seems correct. So xy is 25.

Wait, but let me make sure that this solution actually works. Maybe I should check if there exist such x and y that satisfy both original logarithmic equations.

So, if xy = 25, then y = 25/x.

Let me plug that into the first equation: x^10 = y^x = (25/x)^x.

So x^10 = (25/x)^x. Let's take the natural log:

10 ln x = x ln(25/x) = x (ln 25 - ln x).

So 10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x.

Bring all terms to one side: 10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 = 0.

Factor ln x: ln x (10 + x) - x ln25 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can find x numerically?

Alternatively, let me try plugging y = 25/x into the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}.

So (25/x)^10 = x^{4*(25/x)}.

Simplify left side: (25^10)/(x^10) = x^{(100/x)}.

So 25^10 / x^10 = x^{(100/x)}.

Take both sides to the power of x to eliminate the exponent on the right:

(25^10 / x^10)^x = x^{100}.

Which is 25^{10x} / x^{10x} = x^{100}.

Multiply both sides by x^{10x}:

25^{10x} = x^{10x + 100}.

Take the natural log:

10x ln25 = (10x + 100) ln x.

Divide both sides by 10:

x ln25 = (x + 10) ln x.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, meaning it's probably not solvable algebraically. But since the problem just asks for xy, and we found that xy=25, maybe that's sufficient.

But just to make sure, let's see if we can find x and y that satisfy both equations.

Alternatively, maybe we can assume that x and y are powers of the same base. Let me suppose that x = a^k and y = a^m for some a >1, and k, m real numbers.

Then, let's substitute into the first equation: x^10 = y^x.

So (a^k)^10 = (a^m)^{a^k} => a^{10k} = a^{m a^k}.

Therefore, 10k = m a^k. — (A)

Similarly, the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}.

(a^m)^10 = (a^k)^{4 a^m} => a^{10m} = a^{4k a^m}.

So, 10m = 4k a^m. — (B)

So now, we have two equations:

10k = m a^k — (A)

10m = 4k a^m — (B)

Hmm, maybe I can express m from (A) and plug into (B).

From (A): m = (10k)/(a^k)

Plug into (B): 10*(10k)/(a^k) = 4k a^m

Simplify: 100k / a^k = 4k a^m

Divide both sides by k (k ≠0): 100 / a^k = 4 a^m

Divide both sides by 4: 25 / a^k = a^m

Which can be written as a^m = 25 / a^k => a^{m +k} = 25.

Take natural log: (m + k) ln a = ln25. — (C)

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is helping. Maybe I can make another substitution.

Wait, what if a=5? Because 25 is 5 squared. Let me try a=5.

So, a=5. Then equation (C): (m +k) ln5 = ln25. But ln25=2 ln5, so:

(m +k) ln5 = 2 ln5 =>
