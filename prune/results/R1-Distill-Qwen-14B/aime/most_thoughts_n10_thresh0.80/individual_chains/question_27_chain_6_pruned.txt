Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't pass through its center. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, when you spin that circle around the axis, you get a torus. 

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent to it, and it can also rest outside and be tangent. When it's inside, the tangency happens along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, along a circle with radius r_o. The question is asking for the difference r_i - r_o, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find r_i and r_o, subtract them, and then express the result as a reduced fraction. Let's break this down.

First, let's recall some properties of a torus. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this problem, R is 6, and r is 3.

So, the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's also tangent along another circle. I think these circles are on the surface of the sphere and the torus. So, I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency for both internal and external cases.

Let me consider the internal tangent case first. The torus is inside the sphere. The sphere has a radius of 11, so the center of the sphere is at some point, and the torus is placed such that it's tangent to the sphere along a circle. 

I think the key here is to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, and then relate that to the radii r_i and r_o.

Wait, but how exactly are the torus and sphere positioned? When the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the torus (which is on the axis of revolution) must be somewhere inside the sphere. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus's center would be outside the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus as a surface in 3D space. The standard equation for a torus is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius. But in this case, the sphere is centered at the origin, perhaps? Or maybe the torus's axis is aligned with the sphere's center. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of cross sections. Let's imagine looking at the torus and sphere along the axis of the torus. In this cross-sectional view, the torus would look like two circles (since it's a donut shape), and the sphere would appear as a circle as well.

Wait, actually, in cross-section, the sphere would look like a circle with radius 11. The torus, when cut along the axis, would look like two circles: one at radius R - r from the center, and another at R + r. Wait, no, in cross-section, it's actually two circles each with radius r, centered at a distance R from the origin. So in the cross-section, the torus would have an inner radius of R - r = 6 - 3 = 3, and an outer radius of R + r = 6 + 3 = 9.

But the sphere has a radius of 11. So when the torus is placed inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is much larger, so the torus must fit within the sphere.

Wait, but when the torus is tangent to the sphere internally, the point of tangency is a circle. So, in cross-section, the sphere is a circle of radius 11, and the torus is a circle of radius 3 (the minor radius) centered at a distance of 6 from the center of the sphere. Wait, no, in cross-section, the torus's center is at 6 units from the sphere's center, and the torus itself has a minor radius of 3, so in cross-section, the torus would be a circle of
