Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can rewrite them in exponential form to make them easier to handle. So, let's start with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. 

Wait, log base x of y^x equals 10. That means x raised to the 10th power should equal y^x, right? Because if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So applying that here, x^10 = y^x. That's the first equation rewritten.

Now the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, that should translate to y^10 = x^{4y}. So, now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, so I have these two equations with x and y, both greater than 1. I need to solve for x and y, probably find their values and then multiply them together to get xy.

Let me see. Maybe I can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute into the second. So from the first equation: x^10 = y^x. Let's take both sides to the power of 1/x to solve for y.

So, y = (x^10)^(1/x) = x^{10/x}. So y is equal to x raised to the power of 10/x.

Okay, so now I can substitute this expression for y into the second equation. The second equation is y^10 = x^{4y}. Let's plug in y.

So, (x^{10/x})^10 = x^{4y}. Simplify the left side: x^{(10/x)*10} = x^{4y}. So, x^{100/x} = x^{4y}. Since the bases are the same and x >1, their exponents must be equal. So, 100/x = 4y.

Now, substitute y from earlier. Remember y = x^{10/x}. So, 100/x = 4*(x^{10/x}).

Let me write that down: 100/x = 4*x^{10/x}.

Hmm, now I need to solve for x here. Let's see... Maybe I can divide both sides by 4 to make it simpler. So, 25/x = x^{10/x}.

Wait, 25/x equals x^{10/x}. That seems a bit complicated, but perhaps taking logarithms on both sides might help. Let me try that.

Take natural log on both sides: ln(25/x) = ln(x^{10/x}).

Simplify the right side: ln(x^{10/x}) = (10/x)*ln(x). So, the equation becomes:

ln(25/x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Let me write that as:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Hmm, this is one equation with x. Let me see if I can rearrange terms or perhaps make a substitution to make it easier.

Let me denote t = ln(x). Then, ln(25) - t = (10/x)*t. But x is e^t, so 10/x is 10 e^{-t}.

So substituting, the equation becomes:

ln(25) - t = (10 e^{-t})*t.

Hmm, that's:

ln(25) - t = 10 t e^{-t}.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, meaning it can't be solved with simple algebra. Maybe I can rearrange the terms to bring all terms to one side.

So, ln(25) = t + 10 t e^{-t}.

Factor out the t:

ln(25) = t (1 + 10 e^{-t}).

Hmm, this doesn't look straightforward. Maybe I can make another substitution or look for a specific value of t that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess a value for x that satisfies the original equation. Let me see if x is an integer, maybe.

Wait, let's think about possible integer values for x. Let me try x=5. Then, y would be x^{10/x} =5^{1
