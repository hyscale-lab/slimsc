Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me break this down. It sounds like a classic game theory problem, probably involving the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, while a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, first, I should try to identify the losing positions. Let's consider small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.

n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here, so 1 is a winning position for Alice.

n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Wait, no, because if Alice takes 1, Bob is left with 1 token and takes it to win. Wait, but that means Alice can't let Bob take the last token. So maybe Alice can take 1 token, and Bob has to take 1, but then Alice can't do anything. Wait, no, n=2: Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. Or Alice takes 4, which isn't possible because n=2. So Alice can only take 1, leaving Bob to take the last one and win. Wait, that can't be right. So Alice can't force a win when n=2 because whatever she does, Bob can take the last token. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For n=2, Alice's move: she can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Or she can't take 4 because there's only 2. So Alice has no choice but to leave Bob with 1, which Bob takes. Therefore, for n=2, the first player (Alice) cannot win, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win when n=2.

Similarly, let's check n=3. Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. If Bob is faced with n=2, which we just determined is a losing position for the player whose turn it is, so Bob would lose. Wait, wait, so if Alice leaves Bob with n=2, which is a losing position, then Bob can't win, so Alice can win by taking 1. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, but n=3 can't do that. So n=3 is a winning position for Alice.

n=4: Alice can take all 4 tokens and win immediately. So she wins, so Bob can't win here. So n=4 is a winning position for Alice.

n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 for Bob. But n=4 is a winning position for Bob (he can take all 4), so that's bad for Alice. Alternatively, Alice can take 4, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So both options lead to Bob winning. Wait, no, wait. If Alice takes 1 from n=5, she leaves 4, which is a winning position for Bob because he can take all 4 and win. So Bob can win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So in both cases, Bob can win. Therefore, n=5 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused because when the current player can force a win, it's a winning position. So for each n, if the current player can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position,
