Okay, so I need to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. 

First, I remember that in a regular polygon, the number of sides is equal to the number of vertices. So, a dodecagon has 12 vertices. Now, a rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals aren't necessarily aligned in the same way as in a square. So, I need to think about how rectangles can be formed using these sides and diagonals.

I think the key here is to determine how to pick four points (vertices) in the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. But wait, not all sets of four points will form a rectangle. They have to satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, in a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and the diagonals are equal and intersect at 90 degrees.

Wait, but actually, in a regular polygon, the concept of rectangles is a bit different because the sides aren't necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes. So, perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of symmetry and how the diagonals can form right angles.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the dodecagon on a coordinate system. If I inscribe the dodecagon in a unit circle, each vertex can be represented by a point on the circumference corresponding to angles of 30 degrees apart (since 360/12 = 30). So, the vertices would be at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., up to 330°.

If I can model the vertices as points (cos θ, sin θ), then maybe I can find the conditions under which four points form a rectangle. I remember that for four points to form a rectangle, the midpoints of the diagonals must coincide, and the distances between the midpoints and the vertices must satisfy certain properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think combinatorially. How many ways can I choose four points such that they form a rectangle? But that might be complicated because not every set of four points will form a rectangle.

Wait, another approach: in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center. So, for each rectangle, there is a pair of opposite vertices, and another pair of opposite vertices, such that the lines connecting these pairs are perpendicular.

Wait, maybe that's the way to go. So, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of diametrically opposite points, but not just any two pairs. The lines connecting these pairs must be perpendicular.

Wait, no, because in a regular dodecagon, diametrically opposite points are separated by six edges, right
