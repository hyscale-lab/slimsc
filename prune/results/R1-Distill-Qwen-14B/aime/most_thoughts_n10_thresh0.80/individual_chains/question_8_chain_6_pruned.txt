Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down.

First, I notice that both equations are symmetric in a, b, and c. That might help later on because symmetric equations often have symmetries in their solutions.

Let me start by looking at the first equation: a + b + c = 300. That's straightforward. Since a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, this is a classic stars and bars problem, which would normally have C(300 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(302,2) solutions. But of course, we also have the second equation to satisfy, so not all of these will work.

The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me try to factor this expression to see if it simplifies. 

Looking at the terms, I can factor out a, b, or c from each pair. For example, a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Substituting these into the equation gives:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now I have another equation involving a², b², c², a³, b³, c³. Maybe I can relate this to the first equation, since I know a + b + c = 300.

I remember that for symmetric sums, we can use identities involving sums of powers. For example, I know that:

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

Given that a + b + c = 300, then (300)^2 = 90000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

So, a² + b² + c² = 90000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Let me denote S = ab + ac + bc. Then a² + b² + c² = 90000 - 2S.

Wait, but how does that help me with the second equation? Let me see. The second equation is 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So substituting a² + b² + c² from above:

300*(90000 - 2S) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Compute 300*(90000 - 2S) = 300*90000 - 600S = 27,000,000 - 600S.

So the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Rearranging:

-600S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000.

Which is:

-600S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000.

Multiply both sides by -1:

600S + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

So now I have:

600S + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now I have an equation involving S and the sum of cubes. I need another relation to connect these.

I remember that there's an identity for the sum of cubes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Let me write that down:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (300)^3 - 3*300*S + 3abc.

Compute (300)^3: that's 27,000,000.

So a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc.

Plugging this into our previous equation:

600S + (27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc) = 21,000,000.

Simplify this:

600S + 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc = 21,000,000.

Combine like terms:

(600S - 900S) + 27,000,000 + 3abc = 21,000,000.

(-300S) + 27,000,000 + 3abc = 21,000,000.

Move 27,000,000 to the other side:

-300S + 3abc = 21,000,000 - 27,000,000.

Which is:

-300S + 3abc = -6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

-100S + abc = -2,000,000.

Rearranged:

abc = 100S - 2,000,000.

So now I have abc in terms of S.

Remember that S = ab + ac + bc. So, abc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as abc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000.

Alternatively, abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps another approach could be helpful. Let me think about the variables. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, maybe they have to be in some range. For example, if one of them is 0, then the others would have to sum to 300, but let's see.

Wait, let's suppose that one of a, b, c is 0. Let's say a =0. Then the equation a + b + c =300 becomes b + c =300. Then the second equation is:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 0 + 0 + 0 + b²c + 0 + c²b = bc(b + c).

Since b + c =300, this becomes 300 bc = 6,000,000, so bc = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000. So bc=20,000.

So in this case, the number of solutions where a=0 is the number of nonnegative integer solutions (b, c) with b + c =300 and bc=20,000.

Similarly, if b=0 or c=0, the same logic applies.

Wait, but is that the case? Let me check.

If a=0, then the equation reduces to bc(b + c) =6,000,000. But since b + c=300, this is 300 bc=6,000,000, so bc=20,000.

So, for a=0, we need the number of nonnegative integers b, c with b + c=300 and bc=20,000.

Similarly for b=0 and c=0.

So perhaps the number of triples where one of a, b, c is 0 is 3 times the number of solutions for bc=20,000 with b + c=300.

But wait, let's see: for a=0, bc=20,000, b +c=300.

We can solve this as a quadratic equation. Let me denote x = b, then c =300 -x.

So x(300 -x)=20,000.

Expanding: 300x -x² =20,000.

Rearranged: x² - 300x +20,000=0.

Let me compute the discriminant: D=300² -4*1*20,000=90,000 -80,000=10,000.

So sqrt(D)=100.

Thus, x=(300 ±100)/2.

So x=(400)/2=200 or x=(200)/2=100.

So the solutions are x=200, c=100; x=100, c=200.

But wait, x and c must be nonnegative integers, and here x=200, c=100 and x=100, c=200 are both valid.

So for a=0, there are two solutions: (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). But since a is fixed at 0, each solution is unique.

Wait, but wait, in the case where a=0, the solutions are (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). So that's two ordered triples.

Similarly, for b=0, we have similar solutions, but with a and c swapped. Let me see:

If b=0, then a + c=300, and the second equation would become a² c + c² a = ac(a + c)=300 ac=6,000,000. So ac=20,000.

So the equation is a + c=300, a c=20,000.

Same as before, so a and c are roots of x² -300x +20,000=0, which we know has solutions 200 and 100. So the solutions are (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So two solutions.

Similarly, for c=0, we get two solutions: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0).

So altogether, the number of solutions where one of a, b, c is zero is 3*2=6. But wait, no: for each variable being zero, it's two solutions, so 3 variables, each contributing two solutions, so 3*2=6 solutions.

But wait, let me think again. For a=0, the solutions are (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). Similarly for b=0 and c=0.

But wait, are these all distinct? Let's see: (0,200,100), (0,100,200), (200,0,100), (100,0,200), (200,100,0), (100,200,0). Yes, all six are distinct.

So that's 6 solutions where one variable is zero.

Now, what about solutions where none of a, b, c are zero? Maybe I should consider that case too.

So now, let's consider the case where a, b, c are all positive integers. So a, b, c ≥1.

In that case, perhaps I can let a' =a-1, b'=b-1, c'=c-1, so that a', b', c' are nonnegative integers, and a' + b' + c' = 300 -3=297.

But I'm not sure if that substitution will help with the second equation. Maybe it's better to think differently.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the earlier equation:

abc =100S - 2,000,000.

Where S=ab + ac + bc.

So, abc=100(ab + ac + bc) -2,000,000.

Hmm, that's an equation involving a, b, c. Let me try to rearrange it:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Alternatively, abc =100(ab + ac + bc) -2,000,000.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this equation. Let me see.

Let me think of this as abc -100(ab + ac + bc) + 2,000,000=0.

Hmm, maybe it's possible to factor this expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can divide both sides by abc (assuming a, b, c ≠0):

1 - 100(1/c + 1/b + 1/a) = -2,000,000 / abc.

Hmm, but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me denote x =1/a, y=1/b, z=1/c. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the equation as abc -100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Let me factor 100:

abc =100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can add 100^3 to both sides. Let me see:

abc +100^3 =100(ab + ac + bc) +100^3 -2,000,000.

Wait, 100^3 is 1,000,000. So 1,000,000 -2,000,000= -1,000,000.

So, abc +1,000,000 =100(ab + ac + bc) -1,000,000
