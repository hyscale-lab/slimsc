Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem. Alice picks a set A, and then Bob considers all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I have to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me break this down. So, for each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum? And then the total number of such sets across all a in A would be the sum over each a of the number of sets where a is the maximum.

Wait, yes. Because for each a in A, the number of finite nonempty sets B where max(B) = a is 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, the other elements of B have to be less than a, and each such element can be chosen or not. So, the number of subsets is 2^{a-1}, but since B has to be nonempty, we take 2^{a-1} - 1? Wait, no. Wait a second, no, that's not right.

Wait, no. If the maximum is a, then the other elements must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}. The number of subsets is 2^{a-1}. But since B must be nonempty, and the maximum is a, which is included, the other elements can be any subset of {1,2,...,a-1}, including the empty set. Because if the other elements are empty, then B is just {a}, which is nonempty. So the number of such B is 2^{a-1}.

So for each a in A, the number of sets B where max(B)=a is 2^{a-1}.

So the total number of such sets B is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

And this sum is equal to 2024. So sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So the problem reduces to finding a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024. Then find the sum of the elements of A.

So now, I need to find such a set A where the sum of 2^{a-1} is 2024, and then compute the sum of the a's.

But wait, 2^{a-1} is a power of 2. So, the sum is a sum of powers of 2. So 2024 must be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Because if A has multiple elements with the same a, then 2^{a-1} would be added multiple times, but in the problem statement, A is a set, so all elements are distinct. So each a is unique, so each term in the sum is a distinct power of 2.

So, 2024 can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 2, which is equivalent to the binary representation of 2024.

Let me find the binary representation of 2024.

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0.

1012 divided by 2: 506, remainder 0.

506 divided by 2: 253, remainder 0.

253 divided by 2: 126, remainder 1.

126 divided by 2:63, remainder 0.

63 divided by 2:31, remainder1.

31 divided by 2:15, remainder1.

15 divided by2:7, remainder1.

7 divided by2:3, remainder1.

3 divided by2:1, remainder1.

1 divided by2:0, remainder1.

So writing the remainders from last to first: 11111101000.

Wait, let me count the bits:

Starting from the last division:

1, then 1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0.

Wait, let me compute 2024 in binary.

2024 in binary:

Let me compute the powers of 2 up to 2024.

2^0 =1

2^1=2

2^2=4

2^3=8

2^4=16

2^5=32

2^6=64

2^7=128

2^8=256

2^9=512

2^10=1024

2^11=2048 which is larger than 2024.

So the highest power is 1024 (2^10).

2024-1024=1000. So next highest is 512 (2^9). 1000-512=488.

Next, 256 (2^8). 488-256=232.

Next, 128 (2^7). 232-128=104.

Next, 64 (2^6). 104-64=40.

Next, 32 (2^5). 40-32=8.

Next, 8 (2^3). 8-8=0.

So the binary representation is 11111101000.

Let me check:

2^10 + 2^9 +2^8 +2^7 +2^6 +2^5 +2^3 = 1024+512+256+128+64+32+8= let's compute:

1024+512=1536

1536+256=1792

1792+128=1920

1920+64=1984

1984+32=2016

2016+8=2024. Yes, correct.

So the binary representation is 11111101000, which is 2024.

So this corresponds to a sum of 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Wait, but in our problem, the sum is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, 2^{a-1} = 2^{k} implies a-1=k => a=k+1.

So, the exponents k are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So, a-1 =10 => a=11

a-1=9 =>a=10

a-1=8 =>a=9

a-1=7 =>a=8

a-1=6 =>a=7

a-1=5 =>a=6

a-1=3 =>a=4

So the set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, wait, let me check: the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So 2^{10} corresponds to a-1=10 => a=11.

Similarly, 2^9: a=10; 2^8: a=9; 2^7: a=8; 2^6: a=7; 2^5: a=6; 2^3: a=4.

So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, but 2^{3} is in the sum, so a=4 is included.

Wait, but 2^{5} is in the sum too, so a=6 is included.

So A consists of 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So the sum of the elements of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that.

4+6=10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

So the sum is 55.

Wait, but let me double-check. 4+6 is 10, plus 7 is 17, plus 8 is 25, plus9 is34, plus10 is44, plus11 is55. Correct.

So the answer is 55.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binary representation. Let's confirm 2024 in binary.

We know that 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048 which is higher.

2024 - 1024=1000.

1000 -512=488. 512 is 2^9.

488-256=232. 256 is 2^8.

232-128=104. 128 is 2^7.

104-64=40. 64 is 2^6.

40-32=8. 32 is 2^5.

8 is 2^3.

So the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Which corresponds to a's 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Yes, so A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, sum 55.

Wait, just to make sure, let me check the sum of 2^{a-1}:

For a=4: 2^{3}=8

a=6:2^{5}=32

a=7:2^{6}=64

a=8:2^7=128

a=9:2^8=256

a=10:2^9=512

a=11:2^{10}=1024

Now, summing these: 8 +32=40; 40+64=104; 104+128=232; 232+256=488; 488+512=1000; 1000+1024=2024.

Yes, that's correct. So the sum is indeed 2024.

So the sum of the elements in A is 55.

So the answer should be 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). The total number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. To find the sum of the elements of \( A \), we note that for each \( a \in A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum \( a \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). Thus, the sum \( \sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024 \).

Expressing 2024 in binary gives \( 11111101000_2 \), which corresponds to the powers of 2: \( 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \). This implies the elements of \( A \) are \( a = k + 1 \) for \( k \) being the exponents, resulting in \( A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \). The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

Thus, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
