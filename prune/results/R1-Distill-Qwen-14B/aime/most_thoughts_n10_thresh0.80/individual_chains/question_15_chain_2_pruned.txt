Okay, so I have this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths have a length of 16, which I think means they go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, moving either right or up each time. But the catch is that these paths have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that on a grid, the number of paths from the lower left to the upper right without any restrictions is given by combinations. Since you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, the total number of paths is C(16,8), which is 12,870. But this problem is more specific because it's about the number of direction changes.

Wait, direction changes. So each time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. If the path changes direction exactly four times, how does that translate into the number of right and up segments?

Let me think. Suppose the path starts by moving right. Each change of direction would switch between right and up. So if there are four direction changes, that would create five segments of movement. For example, right, then up, then right, up, right, up, right, up, right. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me count the number of direction changes and the number of segments.

If a path starts with right and changes direction once, it has two segments: right and up. If it changes direction twice, it has three segments, and so on. So, four direction changes would result in five segments. So, each path with four direction changes would alternate between right and up, starting with either right or up, and have five total segments.

Since the grid is 8x8, the total right steps are 8 and the total up steps are 8. So these five segments must sum up to 8 in each direction. Let me denote the lengths of the right segments as r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 and the up segments as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5. But wait, no, because the path alternates between right and up. Depending on whether it starts with right or up, the segments will be interleaved.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as: if the path starts with right
