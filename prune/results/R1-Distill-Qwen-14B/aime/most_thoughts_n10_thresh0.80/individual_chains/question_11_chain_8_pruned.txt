Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers and their properties can sometimes be tricky, but let's see if I can figure this out.

First, let me write down what I know. The problem involves a complex number z such that its magnitude is 4. That means |z| = 4, so z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ} where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, since z is a complex number on the circle with radius 4, I can represent it as z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). But maybe using exponential form might be easier when dealing with reciprocals.

Wait, right. Since |z| = 4, the reciprocal of z is 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|². So 1/z = conjugate(z)/(4^2) = conjugate(z)/16. That might be useful for simplifying the expression.

Let me write the given expression again: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

If I substitute z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately.

First, compute (75 + 117i)*4: 75*4 = 300, and 117*4 = 468. So that's 300 + 468i.

Then, (96 + 144i)/4: 96/4 = 24, 144/4 = 36. So that's 24 + 36i.

So, the expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to express each term in terms of sine and cosine. Let me expand e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}.

So, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, expanding each term:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

But i^2 is -1, so that becomes 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 is -1, so this becomes 24 cosθ + ( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ )i + 36 sinθ.

Now, let me combine all the terms together. Let's collect the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.

Real parts:

From first term: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

From second term: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

So total real part: (300 cosθ + 24 cosθ) + (-468 sinθ + 36 sinθ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

From first term: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

From second term: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

So total imaginary part: (300 sinθ -24 sinθ) + (468 cosθ + 36 cosθ) = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

Wait, but the problem only asks for the real part of the entire expression. So we don't need the imaginary part, but maybe it's useful for something else.

So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Our goal is to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies. So, we have an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, and we need to find its maximum.

Wait, actually, it's of the form C cosθ + D sinθ, which is a standard trigonometric expression. The maximum value of such an expression is sqrt(C² + D²). So that might be the way to go.

Let me denote expression as R cosθ + S sinθ, where R = 324 and S = -432.

Wait, no, actually, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, it's 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So, the maximum value is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324²:

324 * 324: let me compute that.

300² = 90000.

24² = 576.

2 * 300 *24 = 14400.

So, 324² = (300 +24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 +24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 +14400 = 104400 +576=104976.

Similarly, 432²: Let's compute.

400² = 160000.

32² = 1024.

2 *400 *32 = 25600.

So, 432² = (400 +32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 +32² = 160000 + 25600 +1024.

160000 +25600 = 185600 + 1024 = 186624.

So, 324² + (-432)^2 = 104976 + 186624 = 291600.

So, sqrt(291600) is sqrt(291600).

Let me see: 540² is 540*540.

500²=250000.

40²=1600.

2*500*40=40000.

So, 540² = (500 +40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 +40² = 250000 +40000 +1600=250000+40000=290000 +1600=291600.

Ah, so sqrt(291600) is 540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, wait, but let me double-check. So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). So, yes, sqrt(324² + 432²) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540.

So, the maximum real part is 54
