Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving a, b, and c. The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I notice that the second equation has terms where each variable is squared and multiplied by the other two. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see.

Looking at the terms, I can group them as follows:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as 300 - a, (a + c) as 300 - b, and (a + b) as 300 - c. Let me substitute these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Expanding each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Combine like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. Now, I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can relate this to some known identities. I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). Since I know a + b + c = 300, I can find ab + ac + bc if I can find a² + b² + c².

Let me compute that. Let S = a + b + c = 300, and let Q = a² + b² + c². Then,

S² = Q + 2(ab + ac + bc)
So, 300² = Q + 2(ab + ac + bc)
Which means 90,000 = Q + 2(ab + ac + bc)

But I don't know ab + ac + bc yet. Let me see if I can find another identity that relates to a³ + b³ + c³.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of S, Q, and P, where P = abc. The identity is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc
So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S(ab + ac + bc) + 3P

Let me denote P = abc for simplicity.

So from earlier, I have equation (let me call it equation (1)):

300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

And from the identity, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S(ab + ac + bc) + 3P. Let me substitute that into equation (1):

300Q - [S³ - 3S(ab + ac + bc) + 3P] = 6,000,000

But S is 300, so S³ is 300³ = 27,000,000.

So now, equation becomes:

300Q - [27,000,000 - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3P] = 6,000,000

Let me expand this:

300Q -27,000,000 + 900(ab + ac + bc) - 3P = 6,000,000

Let me rearrange this:

300Q + 900(ab + ac + bc) - 3P = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000
Which is:

300Q + 900(ab + ac + bc) - 3P = 33,000,000

Hmm, okay. Now, I can factor out 3 from each term:

3*(100Q + 300(ab + ac + bc) - P) = 33,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q + 300(ab + ac + bc) - P = 11,000,000

Now, let's recall from equation (1) earlier, which was 90,000 = Q + 2(ab + ac + bc). Let me denote R = ab + ac + bc for simplicity.

So, equation (1) becomes:

90,000 = Q + 2R => Q = 90,000 - 2R

Substituting Q into the equation above:

100*(90,000 - 2R) + 300R - P = 11,000,000

Calculate 100*(90,000 - 2R) = 9,000,000 - 200R

So now, the equation becomes:

9,000,000 - 200R + 300R - P = 11,000,000

Combine like terms:

9,000,000 + 100R - P = 11,000,000

Subtract 9,000,000 from both sides:

100R - P = 2,000,000

So,

P = 100R - 2,000,000

Now, let me think about what variables I have.

We have:

- S = 300
- Q = 90,000 - 2R
- R = ab + ac + bc
- P = abc = 100R - 2,000,000

So, P = abc is expressed in terms of R.

I think I need another equation to relate these variables. Let me see if I can find another identity or relation.

Wait, perhaps I can use the symmetric sums. Since a, b, c are non-negative integers, and S = a + b + c =300, R=ab + ac + bc, P=abc.

So, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is:

x³ - Sx² + Rx - P = 0

Which is:

x³ - 300x² + Rx - P = 0

But I don't know if that helps directly, but maybe I can use the expression of P in terms of R.

So, P = 100R - 2,000,000

So, the polynomial becomes:

x³ - 300x² + Rx - (100R - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Rx -100R + 2,000,000 = 0

Factor R:

x³ - 300x² + R(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can express R in terms of known quantities.

Wait, I know S, Q, R, and P in terms of each other. Let me see.

We have:

1. Q = 90,000 - 2R
2. P = 100R - 2,000,000

But I also know that in symmetric polynomials, we have the inequality that for non-negative real numbers,

(a + b + c)^3 >= 27abc

But since a, b, c are non-negative integers, this inequality would hold. Let me compute S^3 and 27P to see if that gives me a constraint.

S^3 = 300^3 = 27,000,000

27P = 27*(100R - 2,000,000) = 2700R - 54,000,000

So the inequality is:

27,000,000 >= 2700R - 54,000,000

Bring all terms to left:

27,000,000 + 54,000,000 - 2700R >= 0
81,000,000 - 2700R >= 0
81,000,000 >= 2700R
Divide both sides by 2700:

30,000 >= R

So R <= 30,000

But R is ab + ac + bc.

Also, since a, b, c are non-negative integers, we can think about the minimum possible value of R.

The minimum occurs when two variables are 0 and the third is 300, but then R would be 0*300 + 0*300 + 0*300 = 0. But wait, if two of them are 0, then ab + ac + bc is 0. So R can be as low as 0, but in this case, let's see what happens.

Wait, but if R is 0, then P = 100*0 - 2,000,000 = -2,000,000, which is negative, but P is abc, which is a product of non-negative integers, so P must be non-negative. Therefore, R cannot be less than 20,000 because P =100R - 2,000,000 >=0 => 100R >= 2,000,000 => R >=20,000.

So R must be between 20,000 and 30,000, inclusive.

So 20,000 <= R <=30,000

But R is an integer because a, b, c are integers, so R is the sum of products of integers, so R is integer.

So R is an integer between 20,000 and 30,000.

Now, so R can take values from 20,000 to 30,000, but not all these values may be possible because a, b, c must satisfy the given equations.

Wait, but I also have that Q = 90,000 -2R. Since Q is a² + b² + c², which is always non-negative. So,

90,000 - 2R >=0 => 90,000 >=2R => R <=45,000

But we already have R <=30,000, so that condition is satisfied.

So R is between 20,000 and 30,000.

So now, perhaps for each R in 20,000 to 30,000, we can find how many triples (a,b,c) satisfy the given conditions.

But that seems like a lot of possibilities to check. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another expression for a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Wait, another way to write that expression is:

ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a)

But since a + b + c =300, we can substitute a + b =300 -c, etc.

So:

ab(300 -c) + bc(300 -a) + ca(300 -b)

Which expands to:

300ab - abc + 300bc - abc + 300ca - abc
= 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc

Which is:

300R - 3P

But from the given equation, this is equal to 6,000,000.

So,

300R - 3P =6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100R - P = 2,000,000

Which is the same as earlier: P =100R -2,000,000

So that's consistent with what I found before.

So, this gives me that P is known in terms of R.

So, now, for the variables a, b, c, they must satisfy:

a + b + c =300

ab + ac + bc = R

abc = 100R -2,000,000

So, in other words, a, b, c are the roots of the cubic equation:

x³ - 300x² + Rx - (100R -2,000,000) =0

Which is:

x³ -300x² + Rx -100R +2,000,000=0

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this equation. Let me try to see if it can be factored by grouping.

Looking at the terms:

x³ -300x² + Rx -100R +2,000,000

Group the first two terms and the next two:

(x³ -300x²) + (Rx -100R) +2,000,000

Factor:

x²(x -300) + R(x -100) +2,000,000

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Perhaps I can factor (x -100) out? Let me see.

Let me try to factor (x -100) from the entire cubic. Let's perform polynomial division or use the factor theorem.

Suppose (x -100) is a factor. Then, substituting x=100 into the cubic should give zero.

Let's check:

100³ -300*(100)^2 + R*100 -100R +2,000,000

Calculate each term:

100³ = 1,000,000

300*(100)^2 = 300*10,000=3,000,000

R*100 -100R =0

So,

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 +0 +2,000,000= 0

Which is 1,000,000 -3,000,000 = -2,000,000 +2,000,000=0. So yes, (x -100) is a factor.

So, the cubic can be factored as (x -100)(x² -200x + (R +20000))=0 ?

Wait, let me perform the division properly.

Divide the cubic by (x -100):

Divide x³ -300x² + Rx -100R +2,000,000 by (x -100).

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    R        -100R +2,000,000
           100     -200      100R -2,000,000
       ----------------------------------------
          1   -200    (R -200)    0

So, the cubic factors as (x -100)(x² -200x + (R -200)) =0

Wait, let me verify:

(x -100)(x² -200x + (R -200)) = x³ -200x² + (R -200)x -100x² +20000x -100(R -200)

Combine like terms:

x³ + (-200x² -100x²) + [(R-200) +20000]x + (-100R +20,000)

Which is:

x³ -300x² + (R +19,800)x -100R +20,000

But comparing to original cubic: x³ -300x² + Rx -100R +2,000,000

So, the coefficient of x in the product is R +19,800, but in the original it's R. Therefore, 19,800 must be zero, which is not possible. So, I must have made a mistake in the division.

Wait, perhaps the quadratic factor is x² -200x + (something). Let me redo the synthetic division.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the synthetic division step.

Wait, when I divided x³ -300x² + Rx -100R +2,000,000 by (x -100), I should have:

The coefficients are 1, -300, R, (-100R +2,000,000)

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 100: 1*100=100. Add to next coefficient: -300 +100= -200.

Multiply -200 by 100= -20,000. Add to next coefficient: R + (-20,000) = R -20,000.

Multiply (R -20,000) by 100= 100R -2,000,000. Add to last coefficient: (-100R +2,000,000) + (100R -2,000,000)=0.

So the quadratic factor is x² -200x + (R -20,000)

So the cubic factors as (x -100)(x² -200x + R -20,000)=0

So, the cubic equation is (x -100)(x² -200x + (R -20,000))=0

Therefore, the roots are x=100, and roots of x² -200x + (R -20,000)=0

So, either one of a, b, c is 100, and the other two satisfy x² -200x + (R -20,000)=0.

Let me denote the other two variables as y and z. Then,

y + z =200

yz = R -20,000

Because from the quadratic equation, the sum of roots is 200, and the product is (R -20,000).

So, the roots are y and z, with y + z=200 and yz= R -20,000.

So, in terms of a, b, c, one of them is 100, and the other two add up to 200, and their product is R -20,000.

But R is ab + ac + bc.

Wait, but since one of a, b, c is 100, let's say a=100. Then, b + c =200, and bc = R -20,000.

But R = ab + ac + bc =100b +100c + bc =100(b + c) + bc

But b + c=200, so R=100*200 + bc=20,000 + bc

So, bc = R -20,000

Which matches the earlier equation yz=R -20,000.

So that's consistent.

So, okay, so for each R, we can find bc = R -20,000. But since R =20,000 + bc, and bc must be a non-negative integer.

So, R must be at least 20,000, which we already had from earlier.

But since R is between 20,000 and 30,000, R -20,000 is between 0 and 10,000.

So, bc can range from 0 to 10,000.

But also, since b + c =200, and b and c are non-negative integers, bc can range from 0 (when one is 0 and the other is 200) up to (100)^2=10,000 (when b=c=100). So, that's correct.

So, for each R, we have R =20,000 + bc, with bc between 0 and10,000.

But wait, the problem is that for each R, there may be multiple (b,c) pairs that satisfy b + c=200 and bc=R -20,000.

So, for each R, how many solutions (b,c) are there?

Because a is fixed at 100, and b and c are determined based on R.

But wait, but in reality, a, b, c can be in any order. So, for each triple, either a, b, or c is 100.

So, perhaps I should count all possible triples where one of the variables is 100, and the other two satisfy b + c=200 and bc=R -20,000, with R varying from 20,000 to30,000.

But R is determined by the product bc, as R=20,000 + bc.

So, bc can range from 0 to10,000, so R ranges from20,000 to 30,000.

So, for each bc from 0 to10,000, there is a corresponding R, and for each such R, how many (b,c) pairs are there?

Each pair (b,c) such that b + c=200 and bc=k, where k is from0 to10,000.

So, for each k, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of integer solutions (b,c) to b + c=200 and bc=k.

Which is equivalent to solving the quadratic equation x² -200x +k=0.

The discriminant is 200² -4k =40,000 -4k.

For integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

So, 40,000 -4k must be a perfect square.

Let me denote D=40,000 -4k.

Then D must be a perfect square, say D=m².

So,

40,000 -4k = m² => 4k =40,000 -m² => k=(40,000 -m²)/4=10,000 - (m²)/4

Since k must be integer, m² must be divisible by4, meaning m must be even.

Let me set m=2n, where n is integer, so:

k=10,000 - (4n²)/4=10,000 -n²

So, k=10,000 -n².

But since k >=0, 10,000 -n² >=0 =>n² <=10,000 =>n <=100.

Also, since m is non-negative (as it's a square root), n can range from0 to100.

So, for each n from0 to100, we get k=10,000 -n².

Thus, for each such k, the equation x² -200x +k=0 has roots (100 ±n), since:

x = [200 ± sqrt(40,000 -4k)]/2 = [200 ± sqrt(m²)]/2 = [200 ±m]/2= [200 ±2n]/2=100 ±n

So, the solutions are x=100 +n and x=100 -n.

But since b and c are non-negative integers, 100 -n must be >=0.

So, 100 -n >=0 =>n <=100, which is already satisfied.

So, for each n from0 to100, we have a pair (b,c)=(100 +n,100 -n) or (100 -n,100 +n).

But since b and c are non-negative, n can be from0 to100.

Wait, but when n=100, 100 -n=0, so one of the variables becomes zero.

So, each n from0 to100 gives a unique solution pair (b,c)=(100 +n,100 -n) and (100 -n,100 +n). But actually, these are the same pairs, just swapped.

So, the number of distinct (b,c) pairs is equal to the number of possible n's, but considering that (b,c) and (c,b) are the same unless b=c.

When does b=c? When n=0, because then b=c=100.

So, for n=0, we have only one pair (100,100).

For n>0, each pair (100 +n,100 -n) and (100 -n,100 +n) are distinct unless n=0.

But in the context of our problem, since a is fixed at 100, and b and c are varying, each distinct pair (b,c) corresponds to a distinct triple (100,b,c). But since b and c can be swapped, each pair gives two triples unless b=c.

Wait, no, actually, in our case, a is fixed at 100, so each (b,c) is unique, regardless of order, because a is fixed. So for each n from 0 to100, we get exactly one triple where a=100, b=100+n, c=100-n.

But wait, when n=100, c=0, so the triple is (100,200,0). Similarly, when n=0, it's (100,100,100).

But wait, but in our problem, a, b, c can be in any order. So, if a, b, or c is 100, we should consider all three possibilities.

Wait, so earlier, I assumed a=100, but actually, any of a, b, c could be 100.

So, each triple where one of the variables is 100, and the other two sum to200 and multiply to k.

So, for each n from0 to100, the pair (b,c)= (100 +n,100 -n) gives a triple where a=100, b=100 +n, c=100 -n.

Similarly, if b=100, then a + c=200, and ac=k=R -20,000.

Similarly, if c=100, then a + b=200, and ab=k=R -20,000.

So, for each n from0 to100, each of the three variables could be 100, leading to three different triples, unless when two variables are equal to100.

Wait, for example, when n=0, the triple is (100,100,100). So in this case, all three variables are 100, so swapping them doesn't lead to different triples.

Similarly, when n=100, the triple is (100,200,0). So in this case, the triple is (100,200,0), which is the same as (200,100,0) or (0,100,200), etc., but in our case, we are fixing one variable as100, so each triple is counted only once.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

Suppose I fix a=100, then for each n, I get a unique triple (100,100 +n,100 -n).

Similarly, if I fix b=100, then I get triples (100 +n,100,100 -n), which are different from the previous ones unless n=0.

Similarly, if I fix c=100, I get triples (100 +n,100 -n,100), which are different unless n=0.

So, for n ≠0, each triple is counted three times, once with each variable fixed as100.

But for n=0, all three variables are100, so it's only counted once.

Therefore, in total, the number of triples is:

For n=0: 1 triple.

For n=1 to100: each n gives three distinct triples.

So, total number of triples would be 1 +3*100=301.

But wait, is that correct? Let's think.

Each n from1 to100 gives three distinct triples where one variable is100, and the other two are100 +n and100 -n.

But wait, for each n, the three triples are:

(100,100 +n,100 -n), (100 +n,100,100 -n), (100 +n,100 -n,100)

Which are all distinct because the positions of100 are different.

But when n=0, all are 100, so it's only one triple.

So, in total, 1 +100*3=301 triples.

But wait, let me check for n=100: the triple would be (100,200,0). But when n=100, the pair is (200,0), so the triple is (100,200,0). Similarly, if I fix b=100, it would be (200,100,0), and if I fix c=100, it would be (200,0,100). So, these are all distinct triples.

Similarly, for n=50, triples would be (100,150,50), (150,100,50), (150,50,100), etc.

So, yes, for each n from1 to100, we have three distinct triples, and for n=0, one triple.

So, total number of triples is 301.
