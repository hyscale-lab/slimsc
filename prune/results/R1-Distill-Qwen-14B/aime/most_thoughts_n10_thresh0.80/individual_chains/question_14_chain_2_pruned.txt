Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Alright, let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is abcd, changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, and so on for each digit. Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

My goal is to find the largest such N possible. Then, when I divide N by 1000, Q is the quotient, which is effectively the thousands digit, and R is the remainder, which is the last three digits. So, Q + R would be the thousands digit plus the last three digits.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since N is the largest possible four-digit number with this property, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the condition. But that might take too long, so I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the structure of N. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits, and a is not zero (since it's a four-digit number). 

Now, the problem says that changing any digit to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Let's consider each case:

1. Replacing a with 1: The number becomes 1bcd. So, 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
2. Replacing b with 1: The number becomes a1cd. So, 1000a + 100 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
3. Replacing c with 1: The number becomes ab1d. So, 1000a + 100b + 10 + d must be divisible by 7.
4. Replacing d with 1: The number becomes abc1. So, 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. Therefore, for the original number N, when we make these specific changes, each of the modified numbers is a multiple of 7.

I think I can set up equations based on the divisibility condition. Remember, a number is divisible by 7 if the number modulo 7 is zero.

Let me handle each case:

1. 1bcd ≡ 0 mod 7. This is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.
2. a1cd ≡ 0 mod 7. This is 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.
3. ab1d ≡ 0 mod 7. This is 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.
4. abc1 ≡ 0 mod 7. This is 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Additionally, N itself is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, and it's a four-digit number. But I don't know if N is divisible by 7 or not. The problem only states that changing a single digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. So N itself might not be divisible by 7.

But to find N, perhaps I can find conditions on a, b, c, d by considering the four modified numbers.

Let me compute each modified number modulo 7 and set each equal to zero.

First, let me compute what 1000, 100, 10, and 1 are modulo 7 to simplify calculations.

- 1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 / 7. 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.
- 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7.
- 10 mod7=3.
- 1 mod7=1.

So, let's rewrite each modified number:

1. 1bcd: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ (6 + 2b + 3c + d) mod7 ≡ 0.
2. a1cd: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ (6a + 2 + 3c + d) mod7 ≡ 0.
3. ab1d: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ (6a + 2b + 3 + d) mod7 ≡ 0.
4. abc1: 1000a + 100b +10c +1 ≡ (6a + 2b + 3c +1) mod7 ≡ 0.

So, we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7. (Equation 1)
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7. (Equation 2)
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7. (Equation 3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7. (Equation 4)

Our variables are a, b, c, d, each digits from 0-9, except a which is at least 1.

Our goal is to find the largest N=1000a+100b+10c+d that satisfies all four equations.

Let me see if I can express these equations in terms of each other.

Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2 to eliminate some variables.

Equation1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

Equation2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

Subtract Equation2 - Equation1:

(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) = 6a +2 -6 -2b =6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

We can write this as:

6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

So, 3a - b ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation5.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation3 - Equation4.

Equation3:6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation4:6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Subtract Equation4 from Equation3:

(6a +2b +3 +d) - (6a +2b +3c +1) = 3 +d -3c -1 =2 +d -3c ≡0 mod7.

So, 2 +d -3c ≡0 mod7.

Thus, d -3c ≡-2 mod7, which is same as d -3c ≡5 mod7. Let's call this Equation6.

Now, let's see if we can find other relationships.

Let me consider Equation1:6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

From Equation6, d =3c -5 mod7.

Wait, no. Equation6 is d ≡3c -2 mod7? Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, Equation6: 2 +d -3c ≡0 mod7 --> d ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, d ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, d is congruent to 3c -2 mod7. So, d can be written as 3c -2 +7k, where k is an integer such that d remains a digit (0-9).

So, d = (3c -2) mod7, but since d is a digit, d can be 3c -2, 3c -2 +7, or 3c -2 -7, but ensuring that d is between 0 and 9.

Wait, but 3c can be up to 27 (if c=9). So 3c -2 can be up to 25, and down to 3*0 -2= -2.

But d must be a digit, so d is between 0 and 9. So, we can write d = (3c -2) mod7, but that may not directly give d, since mod7 can be 0-6. So perhaps d = (3c -2) mod7, but considering that d is in 0-9, we might have to adjust.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that d ≡3c -2 mod7, which means that d can be written as 3c -2 +7k, where k is an integer such that d is between 0 and 9.

So, for each c (0-9), we can compute d as (3c -2) mod7, but adjusted to be a digit.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of possible c and d values that satisfy d ≡3c -2 mod7.

But maybe I can use that in Equation1.

Equation1:6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

But d =3c -2 +7k, so substitute into Equation1:

6 +2b +3c + (3c -2 +7k) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6 -2 +2b +3c +3c +7k ≡0 mod7.

Which is 4 +2b +6c +7k ≡0 mod7.

But 7k ≡0 mod7, so we can ignore it.

So, 4 +2b +6c ≡0 mod7.

Now, 6c can be written as 6c mod7, but 6 ≡-1 mod7, so 6c ≡-c mod7.

Similarly, 2b remains as 2b.

So, 4 +2b -c ≡0 mod7.

Which is 2b -c +4 ≡0 mod7.

Or, 2b -c ≡-4 mod7, which is same as 2b -c ≡3 mod7.

Let me write this as Equation7: 2b -c ≡3 mod7.

We have Equation5: 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Equation7: 2b -c ≡3 mod7.

Equation6: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, now, I have Equation5, Equation7, and Equation6.

Let me see if I can express variables in terms of others.

From Equation5: 3a ≡b +2 mod7. So, b ≡3a -2 mod7.

From Equation7: 2b ≡c +3 mod7. So, c ≡2b -3 mod7.

From Equation6: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, we can express b in terms of a, c in terms of b, and d in terms of c.

So, since a is a digit from 1-9, and b, c, d from 0-9, perhaps I can express everything in terms of a.

Let me try that.

From Equation5: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

So, possible b values are of the form b =3a -2 +7k, where k is an integer such that b is between 0 and 9.

Similarly, from Equation7: c ≡2b -3 mod7.

So, c can be expressed as c=2b -3 +7m, where m is an integer such that c is between 0 and9.

From Equation6: d=3c -2 +7n, where n is an integer such that d is between 0 and9.

So, let me see if I can express c in terms of a.

Since b is expressed in terms of a, then c is expressed in terms of b, which is in terms of a.

Let me substitute b into c's expression.

So, c=2b -3 +7m.

But b=3a -2 +7k.

So, c=2*(3a -2 +7k) -3 +7m.

=6a -4 +14k -3 +7m.

=6a -7 +14k +7m.

=6a -7 +7(2k + m).

So, c=6a -7 +7t, where t=2k +m.

Now, since c must be between 0 and9, let's see what 6a -7 can be.

a is from1 to9.

6*1 -7= -1 → c= -1 +7t.

But c must be ≥0, so -1 +7t ≥0 →7t≥1→t≥1 (since t is integer).

So, t≥1.

Similarly, 6a -7 for a=9 is 54 -7=47. So, c=47 +7t, but since c≤9, 47 +7t ≤9 →7t ≤-38, which is impossible because t is at least 1.

Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let's re-examine the substitution.

Wait, c=2b -3 +7m.

But b=3a -2 mod7, so b=3a -2 +7k, but 3a -2 must be between 0 and6, because b is a digit (0-9).

Wait, no. Wait, b is a digit (0-9). So, 3a -2 can be from 3*1 -2=1 to 3*9 -2=25.

So, when a=1: 3*1 -2=1, so b can be 1, 8, 15,... but since b is a digit, b can be 1 or 8 (since 15 is too big). So, for a=1, possible b is 1 or 8.

Similarly, a=2: 3*2-2=4. So, b=4, 11, 18,... but b is a digit, so 4 or 11? 11 is invalid, so only 4.

Wait, but 4 is a single digit, so 4 is allowed. So, for a=2, b=4.

Wait, no, 3a -2 +7k. Wait, for a=2: 3*2 -2=4. So, k=0 gives b=4; k=1 gives 4+7=11, which is invalid. So, only b=4 for a=2.

Similarly, a=3: 3*3 -2=7. So, b=7 or 14, but 14 is invalid. So, b=7.

a=4: 3*4 -2=10. b=10 is invalid. So, 10-7=3. So, k=-1: 10 -7=3. So, b=3.

Wait, that's a different approach. Since b must be a digit, for a=4, 3a -2=10. So, 10 mod7=3. So, b=3 or 3+7=10, which is invalid. So, b=3.

Wait, so for each a, b is (3a -2) mod7, but adjusted to be a digit.

So, perhaps the initial approach to express b as 3a -2 +7k is complicating it. Maybe a better approach is to compute b as (3a -2) mod7, but if that is negative, add 7 to make it positive, and then see if b is a digit.

Wait, but given that a is from1-9, 3a -2 ranges from1 to25.

So, 3a -2 mod7 will be from0 to6. But b must be a digit (0-9). So, for each a, b can be (3a -2) mod7 or (3a -2) mod7 +7, as long as it's ≤9.

Wait, for example:

a=1: 3*1-2=1 mod7=1, so b=1 or 1+7=8.

a=2: 3*2-2=4, so b=4 or 4+7=11 (invalid). So only b=4.

a=3: 3*3-2=7 mod7=0, so b=0 or 0+7=7.

a=4: 3*4-2=10 mod7=3, so b=3 or 3+7=10 (invalid). So, b=3.

a=5: 3*5-2=13 mod7=6, so b=6 or 6+7=13 (invalid). So, b=6.

a=6: 3*6-2=
