Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. I need to place some of these chips in the 25 cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, if I were to place any more chips on the grid, it would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

And I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, okay. So each row has to be all white or all black, and the same goes for each column. So that means that each row is monochromatic, and each column is monochromatic too. But wait, if a row is all white, then each cell in that row is white, but each column that has a white cell in that row must also be all white. Or wait, noâ€”if a row is white, then for each cell in that row, the column it's in must also be all white. That seems restrictive because the row and column constraints can interfere with each other.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose I decide that the first row is all white. Then, for each cell in that row, the corresponding column must also be all white. So, if the first row is white, say, then all columns that intersect with the first row must also be entirely white. But if I have a column that's all white, then all the rows in that column must also be white. Wait, that's starting to sound like either all the rows are white, or all the columns are white, but that can't be the case unless the entire grid is one color.

But wait, that can't be right because the problem allows for both white and black chips. So maybe my initial thought is incorrect.

Let me approach this more systematically. Let's consider the possible colorings of the grid where each row is monochromatic and each column is monochromatic.

Each row can be independently white or black, but the column constraints must also hold. So, for example, if I set a row to white, then all columns in that row must be white
