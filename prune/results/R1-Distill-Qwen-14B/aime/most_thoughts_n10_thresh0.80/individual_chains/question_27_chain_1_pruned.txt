Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle. The distance from the center of the circle to this axis is 6. So, this is like a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11.

The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. And when T rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. So, I think I need to visualize how the torus can be tangent to the sphere both internally and externally.

Let me recall what a torus is. A torus can be described by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, when the circle of radius 3 is revolved around the axis 6 units away, the major radius R is 6 and the minor radius r is 3.

So, R = 6 and r = 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent internally. So the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside. The point of tangency would be where the outer surface of the torus just touches the inner surface of the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, it's tangent externally, meaning the inner surface of the torus touches the outer surface of the sphere.

Wait, no, maybe I should think again. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, and the torus is touching it from the inside. So the point of tangency would be on the outer part of the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is smaller, and the torus is touching from the outside, so the point of tangency is on the inner part.

But perhaps I'm complicating it. Maybe it's better to model the equations.

The sphere S has equation x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

The torus T can be represented parametrically. Alternatively, the equation of a torus is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r², where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.

Wait, that equation might not be accurate. Let me think. The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin, with the z-axis as the axis of revolution, is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r². So, in this case, R = 6, r = 3.

So, the equation of T is (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

Now, when T is inside S, it's tangent to S. So, the point of tangency is a circle on both surfaces. So, at the point of tangency, the two surfaces share a common tangent plane. Since both are surfaces of revolution, their intersection should be a circle.

Similarly, when T is outside S, they are tangent along another circle.

Wait, but how do I find the radii r_i and r_o of these circles?

Hmm. Let me think about the internal tangent case first.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11. The torus is centered at the origin, and the sphere is also centered at the origin, I assume.

The maximum distance from the origin on the torus would be R + r = 6 +
