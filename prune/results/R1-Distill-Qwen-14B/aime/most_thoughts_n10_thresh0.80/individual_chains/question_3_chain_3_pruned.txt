Okay, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. Remember, the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A โฉ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize (which includes winning the grand prize). So, the probability we want is P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B), since if she wins the grand prize, she definitely wins a prize, so A is a subset of B.

So, first, I need to compute P(A), the probability that she wins the grand prize. Then, compute P(B), the probability that she wins a prize (at least two correct numbers). Then, divide them to get the conditional probability.

Let's start with P(A). The grand prize is when all four of her numbers are chosen. So, the total number of possible lottery outcomes is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is 1, since she has to pick exactly the same 4 numbers. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, compute P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, this can be calculated as 1 minus the probability that fewer than two numbers are chosen. Alternatively, it's the sum of the probabilities that exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers are chosen. But since P(A) is included in P(B), maybe it's better to compute it directly.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the complement. So, the probability of not winning a prize is the probability that zero or one of her numbers are chosen. So, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 correct) + P(1 correct)]. Let's compute that.

First, total possible ways to choose 4 numbers: 210.

To compute P(0 correct): The number of ways to choose 4 numbers none of which are in Jen's 4 numbers. Since Jen picked 4 distinct numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). C(6,4) is 15. So, number of ways with 0 correct is 15, so P(0 correct) = 15 / 210.

Next, P(1 correct): The number of ways to choose exactly 1 of Jen's numbers and 3 from the remaining 6. That's C(4,1) * C(6,3). C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. So, P(1 correct) = 80 / 210.

So, the probability of not winning a prize is (15 + 80) / 210 = 95 / 210. Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me double-check that math. 15 + 80 is 95, so 210 - 95 is 115. So yes, P(B) is 115/210. Simplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator can be divided by 5. 115 รท5=23, 210 รท5=42. So, 23/42.

Wait, 23 and 42: 23 is a prime number, 42 is
