Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ +1 is divisible by p squared, so p² divides n⁴ +1. Once I find that p, I then have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

Wait, so the first part is finding the smallest prime p such that there's some n making n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Then, the second part is finding the smallest m where m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I think I remember something about primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. So, for primes where -1 is a fourth power, maybe p² divides m⁴ +1 for some m.

But how do I know which primes p have this property?

I recall that for a prime p, the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic if p is odd. So, for primes other than 2, the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). So, if -1 is a fourth power in this group, then there exists m such that m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Wait, but how does that connect to the structure of the group?

Hmm. Maybe I should start by checking small primes and see if any satisfy that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Let me check p=2 first. Then p²=4. So, we need n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod 4. Let's see, n⁴ mod 4. For n even, n=2k, so (2k)^4=16k⁴ ≡ 0 mod 4. So, n even: n⁴ ≡0 mod4, so n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod4. For n odd: n=2k+1, (2k+1)^4: Let's compute that modulo 4. Let me compute (1)^4=1, (3)^4=81 ≡1 mod4. So, for any n, n⁴ ≡0 or 1 mod4. So, n⁴+1 is either 1 or 2 mod4. So, n⁴+1 is never divisible by 4. So, p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Then p²=9. We need to find if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod9. Which is equivalent to n⁴ ≡8 mod9.

Let me compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9=1.

n=2: 16 mod9=7.

n=3: 81 mod9=0.

n=4: 4⁴=256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4, so 4.

n=5: 5⁴=625. 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. So, 4 mod9.

n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod9=0.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401/9=266*9=2394, 2401-2394=7. So, 7 mod9.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096/9=455*9=4095, 4096-4095=1 mod9.

So, the possible n⁴ mod9 are 0,1,4,7. So, 8 mod9 is not achieved. So, no solution for p=3.

Next prime: p=5. Then p²=25. Let's see if any n has n⁴ ≡-1 mod25, which is 24 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24, but maybe just compute for a few to see.

Alternatively, since 5 is small, maybe we can find it.

Alternatively, note that in modulo 5, n⁴ must ≡-1 mod5, which is 4 mod5. So, n⁴ ≡4 mod5.

But in mod5, n^4: For n=1,1; n=2,16≡1; n=3,81≡1; n=4,256≡1. So, n⁴ mod5 is always 0 or 1. So, n⁴ ≡4 mod5 is impossible. So, no solution for p=5.

Wait, that's interesting. So, for p=5, since no solution exists mod5, there can't be a solution mod25 either.

So, p=5 is out.

Next prime: p=7. So, p²=49. We need to find if any n has n⁴ ≡-1 mod49, which is 48 mod49.

Again, perhaps checking mod7 first. So, n⁴ ≡-1 mod7 is equivalent to n⁴≡6 mod7.

Compute n⁴ mod7 for n=1 to 6.

n=1: 1

n=2: 16 mod7=2

n=3:81 mod7=81-11*7=81-77=4

n=4:256 mod7: 256/7=36*7=252, 256-252=4. So, 4.

n=5:625 mod7: 625-89*7=625-623=2.

n=6:1296 mod7: 1296/7=185*7=1295, 1296-1295=1.

So, n⁴ mod7 can be 1,2,4.

So, 6 mod7 is not achievable. So, no solution for p=7.

Next prime: p=11. Hmm, let's see.

Wait, maybe I should think about the conditions when n⁴ ≡-1 mod p² has a solution.

I think that for primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, then it's possible that it can be lifted to modulo p².

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps p must be 1 mod8? Because if -1 is a square, then p must be 1 mod4, but for it to be a quartic residue, maybe p must be 1 mod8.

Wait, but I recall that when p ≡1 mod4, -1 is a square modulo p, but for it to be a quartic residue, more conditions are needed.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). So, for -1 to be a fourth power, the order of -1 must divide (p(p-1))/4. Wait, but the order of -1 in the multiplicative group is 2, since (-1)^2=1.

So, for -1 to be a quartic residue, 2 must divide (p(p-1))/4. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use Hensel's lemma to see whether solutions can be lifted from mod p to
