Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to find the product xy where x and y are both real numbers greater than 1. The problem says that the logarithm of y^x with base x is equal to 10, and the logarithm of x^{4y} with base y is also equal to 10. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but I'll take it step by step.

First, let me write down what I know. The two logarithmic equations given are:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be converted using the change of base formula. Maybe that will help here. The change of base formula says that log_b(a) = (ln a) / (ln b), where ln is the natural logarithm. Alternatively, I can use log_b(a) = (log_c a) / (log_c b) for any positive c ≠ 1.

Wait, but perhaps there's a simpler way by using logarithm properties. Let me recall some key properties:

- log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a)
- log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b)
- If log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a.

So, maybe I can apply these properties to each equation.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the power rule, this simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10. So, x * log_x(y) = 10.

But log_x(y) can also be written as (ln y)/(ln x). So, substituting that in, we get x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

Hmm, that's one equation. Let me write that down:

Equation 1: x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

Now, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Similarly, log_y(x) is (ln x)/(ln y). So substituting that in, we have 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10.

Let me write that as Equation 2: 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10.

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. x * (ln y / ln x) = 10
2. 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10

Hmm, interesting. Let me look for a way to relate these two equations. Maybe I can call (ln x)/(ln y) as some variable, say, k. Then, (ln y)/(ln x) would be 1/k.

So, let me let k = (ln x)/(ln y). Then, (ln y)/(ln x) = 1/k.

Substituting into Equation 1: x * (1/k) = 10 → x = 10k.

Similarly, Equation 2: 4y * k = 10 → 4y k = 10 → y = (10)/(4k) = (5)/(2k).

So now, I have x = 10k and y = 5/(2k). Now, since x and y are both greater than 1, k must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, let's see. Since x = 10k > 1, and k is (ln x)/(ln y), which is a positive number because x and y are both greater than 1, so ln x and ln y are positive. So k is positive.

Similarly, y = 5/(2k) > 1 → 5/(2k) > 1 → 5 > 2k → k < 5/2. So k is between 0 and 2.5.

But maybe I can find k using the fact that x and y are related through k, but I need another equation. Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that k = (ln x)/(ln y). Since x = 10k and y = 5/(2k), I can substitute these into k.

So, k = (ln x)/(ln y) = (ln (10k)) / (ln (5/(2k))).

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of k. Let me write that down:

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))].

That's a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

Alternatively, maybe I can express ln x and ln y in terms of k.

Wait, since x = 10k, ln x = ln(10k) = ln 10 + ln k.

Similarly, y = 5/(2k), so ln y = ln(5/(2k)) = ln 5 - ln(2k) = ln 5 - (ln 2 + ln k).

So, substituting back into k = (ln x)/(ln y):

k = [ln 10 + ln k] / [ln 5 - ln 2 - ln k]

Hmm, that looks a bit messy, but perhaps I can let’s denote A = ln 10, B = ln 5, and C = ln 2.

So, A = ln 10 ≈ 2.302585093, B = ln 5 ≈ 1.609437912, C = ln 2 ≈ 0.693147181.

So, equation becomes:

k = (A + ln k) / (B - C - ln k)

Which is:

k = [A + ln k] / [ (B - C) - ln k ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

k * [ (B - C) - ln k ] = A + ln k

Expanding the left side:

k*(B - C) - k*ln k = A + ln k

Bring all terms to the left:

k*(B - C) - k*ln k - A - ln k = 0

Factor terms with ln k:

k*(B - C) - A - ln k (k + 1) = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated to solve algebraically. Maybe I can plug in some values of k to see if I can find a solution.

But before I do that, perhaps I can think if there's a smarter substitution or a better approach.

Wait, alternatively, I have expressions for x and y in terms of k. Maybe I can substitute x and y into each other or find a relationship between them.

Wait, x = 10k and y = 5/(2k). So, xy = (10k) * (5/(2k)) = (10*5)/(2k*k) *k? Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, no, x is 10k, y is 5/(2k). So, xy = 10k * (5/(2k)) = (10*5)/(2) * (k/k) = (50/2) * 1 = 25.

Wait, that can't be right because I'm getting xy = 25 regardless of k. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again.

x = 10k, y =5/(2k). So, x * y = 10k * 5/(2k) = (10*5)/(2) * (k/k) = 50/2 *1 =25. Yes, that's correct. So, xy is 25.

Wait, but the problem statement says that x and y are both greater than 1, so this would mean that xy is 25. So, is that the answer? But wait, how is that possible? Because I didn't use the equation with k in it. So, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check.

Wait, I derived that x = 10k and y =
