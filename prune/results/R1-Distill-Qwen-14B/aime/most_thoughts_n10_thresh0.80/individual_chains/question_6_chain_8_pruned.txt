Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are a bit complicated, so I need to break them down step by step. Let me write down what I know.

The functions are defined as:
- \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \)

And the two graphs we're looking at are:
1. \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

I need to find how many points these two graphs intersect. Each intersection point is a solution to the system of equations above.

First, I should probably figure out what these functions \( f \) and \( g \) look like. They involve absolute values, so they're likely piecewise linear functions. Let's start by analyzing \( f(x) \).

Function \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \):
- The inner part is \( |x| \), which is a V-shaped graph with the vertex at (0,0).
- Subtract 1/2: So \( |x| - 1/2 \) shifts the graph down by 1/2.
- Then take the absolute value of that: So \( ||x| - 1/2| \) will reflect any part of \( |x| - 1/2 \) that's below the x-axis back above.

Let me sketch this in my mind. The original \( |x| \) has a V shape. Subtracting 1/2 will make it shift down, so the vertex is at (0, -1/2). But then taking the absolute value of that will flip the part below the x-axis. So where \( |x| - 1/2 \) is negative (which occurs when \( |x| < 1/2 \)), it'll become positive, and where it's positive, it remains.

So, \( f(x) \) will have a "W" shape maybe? Let me think. At x=0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. When x is between -1/2 and 1/2, \( |x| < 1/2 \), so \( |x| - 1/2 \) is negative, and the absolute makes it positive, so f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. Beyond x=1/2 or x=-1/2, \( |x| - 1/2 \) is positive, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

So f(x) is a V shape centered at 0, but with a dip in the middle. So the graph has a minimum at x=0, x=1, x=-1, etc. Wait, no, more accurately, it's a V shape that goes from increasing on both sides, but between -1/2 and 1/2, it's a downward slope. Wait, maybe I should plot it for specific points.

At x=0: f(0)=1/2
At x=1/2: f(1/2)= |(1/2) -1/2| = 0
Similarly, at x=-1/2, same.
At x=1: f(1)= |1 -1/2| = 1/2
At x=3/2: f(3/2)= |3/2 -1/2| = 1

So, plotting these points, the function f(x) looks like it has a V shape that goes down from ( -infinity, infinity ) but wait, as x increases, it's | |x| - 1/2 |, which makes it symmetric about the y-axis.

Wait, no. Since |x| is even, f(x
