Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Let me start by understanding the problem. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, let's call them a, b, and c. The surface area of a box is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume is abc. So in this case, 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, and abc = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere has to enclose the entire box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So the radius r is d/2, which means r² is (d²)/4, that is (a² + b² + c²)/4. So my goal is to find the minimum possible value of (a² + b² + c²)/4, given the constraints on the surface area and volume.

Hmm, so I need to minimize a² + b² + c² subject to the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

So, let's write down the constraints:

1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 ⇒ ab + bc + ac = 27
2. abc = 23

I need to minimize a² + b² + c².

I remember that for symmetric functions, sometimes using the method of Lagrange multipliers helps, but I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here. Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of the known quantities.

Wait, there's a relationship between a² + b² + c² and (a + b + c)². Specifically, (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac is 27, this simplifies to (a + b + c)² - 54. So, to minimize a² + b² + c², I need to minimize (a + b + c)².

But how do I relate a + b + c to the given volume and surface area? Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, setting up the function to minimize with the given constraints.

Let me set up the problem formally. Let me define the function to minimize as f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c². The constraints are g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac - 27 = 0 and h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0.

Using Lagrange multipliers, I can set up the system:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h

Where λ and μ are the multipliers.

Calculating the gradients:

∇f = (2a, 2b, 2c)
∇g = (b + c, a + c, a + b)
∇h = (bc, ac, ab)

So the equations become:

2a = λ(b + c) + μ(bc)
2b = λ(a + c) + μ(ac)
2c = λ(a + b) + μ(ab)

Hmm, that's a set of three equations. Plus, we have the two constraints:

ab + bc + ac = 27
abc = 23

This is a system of five equations with five variables: a, b, c, λ, μ. It might be complicated, but maybe I can find some symmetry or assume that a = b = c? Wait, but if a = b = c, then it's a cube. Let's check if that's possible.

If a = b = c, then the surface area would be 6a² = 54 ⇒ a²=9 ⇒ a=3. But then the volume would be 27, which doesn't match 23. So the box isn't a cube, so a, b, c are not all equal. Hmm. So perhaps two sides are equal? Maybe a = b ≠ c.

Let me assume a = b. Then, let's let a = b, so c is different.

Then, our constraints become:

1. Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54. Since a = b, this becomes 2(a² + 2ac) = 54 ⇒ a² + 2ac = 27.

2. Volume: a²c = 23 ⇒ c = 23/(a²)

Substituting c into the surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23/(a²)) = 27 ⇒ a² + (46/a) = 27.

Multiply both sides by a:

a³ + 46 = 27a ⇒ a³ -27a +46 = 0.

Now, let's try to solve this cubic equation: a³ -27a +46 = 0.

Trying integer roots: possible candidates are factors of 46, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0.

a=2: 8 -54 +46= 0. Oh, a=2 is a root.

So we can factor (a -2) from the cubic:

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide a³ -27a +46 by (a-2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23  0

So the cubic factors as (a - 2)(a² + 2a -23) =0.

Thus, a=2 or a² +2a -23=0.

Solving a² +2a -23=0:

a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since a must be positive, a= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible a values: 2 and approximately 3.898.

So, if a=2, then c =23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So the dimensions would be a=2, b=2, c=5.75. Let's check the surface area:

2(ab + bc + ac)=2*(4 + 11.5 + 11.5)=2*(27)=54. Correct.

Volume: 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.

So this is one possible solution with a=2, b=2, c=5.75.

Another solution is a= -1 +2√6 ≈3.898, then c=23/(a²). Let's compute a²:

a²=( -1 +2√6 )²=1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6.

Then c=23/(25 -4√6). Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

c=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25+4√6)/(625-96)=23*(25+4√6)/529.

Since 529=23², so c=(25+4√6)/23.

So c≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

So the dimensions would be a≈3.898, b≈3.898, c≈1.513.

Let me check the surface area:

ab= approx 3.898^2≈15.19, bc≈3.898*1.513≈5.90, ac≈3.898*1.513≈5.90. So sum ab + bc + ac≈15.19 +5.90 +5.90≈26.99≈27. Correct.

Volume: a*b*c≈3.898*3.898*1.513≈23. Correct.

So both solutions are valid. Now, for each case, compute a² + b² + c².

Case 1: a=2, b=2, c=5.75.

a² + b² + c²=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625.

Case 2: a= -1 +2√6, b= same, c=(25 +4√6)/23.

Compute a² + b² + c².

Since a=b, so 2a² + c².

a²=25 -4√6 (from earlier).

So 2*(25 -4√6) + c²=50 -8√6 + c².

c²= [(25 +4√6)/23]^2 = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529 = (721 +200√6)/529.

So total a² + b² + c²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me compute this.

First, let me write 50 as 50*529/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6 is (-8√6)*529/529= (-4232√6)/529.

Then, adding (721 +200√6)/529:

Total= [26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6]/529 = (26450 +721) + (-4232√6 +200√6) all over 529.

Compute 26450 +721=27171.

Compute -4232√6 +200√6= (-4032√6).

So total is (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's compute the approximate value to compare.

Case 1: 41.0625. Let's see, 50 -8√6 ≈50 -8*2.449≈50 -19.592≈30.408. Then, c²≈(1.513)^2≈2.289. So total≈30.408 +2.289≈32.697. Wait, that doesn't make sense because earlier I thought a² + b² + c² was 41.0625. Wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, no, in case 2, a≈3.898, so a²≈15.19, so 2a²≈30.38, c≈1.513, c²≈2.289. So total≈30.38 +2.289≈32.669. Hmm, which is less than case 1's 41.0625. That's interesting. So case 2 gives a smaller a² + b² + c². So that would be the minimal value?

Wait, but wait, no. Because in case 2, the sphere's radius is determined by the space diagonal, which is sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So if case 2 gives a smaller a² + b² + c², then r²=(a² + b² + c²)/4 would be smaller, meaning that the sphere is smaller. So case 2 is better.

But I need to verify if this is indeed the minimal.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs when all three are equal, but we saw that's not possible because the volume would be 27.

Wait, but perhaps there's a better approach. Maybe using inequalities.

I know that for positive real numbers a, b, c, the following inequality holds: (a² + b² + c²)/3 >= ((abc)^(2/3)).

But wait, that's the AM ≥ GM inequality. Wait, but here we have a surface area and volume constraint, so maybe not directly applicable.

Wait, another approach: since we have ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc=23, perhaps we can consider the variables as roots of a cubic equation.

Let me think: Let a, b, c be the roots of x³ - px² + qx - r =0, where p = a + b + c, q = ab + bc + ac =27, r=abc=23.

So the cubic equation is x³ - px² +27x -23=0.

I need to find the minimal value of a² + b² + c², which is p² - 2q = p² -54.

So, if I can find the minimal p², I get the minimal a² + b² + c².

So, I need to minimize p², where p = a + b + c, given that a, b, c are positive real numbers satisfying ab + bc + ac=27 and abc=23.

So the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible p², given these constraints.

Is there a known inequality for p given q and r? Hmm.

I recall that for positive real numbers, there's an inequality involving p, q, and r.

Wait, perhaps using the AM ≥ GM inequality on a, b, c.

We have (a + b + c)/3 ≥ (abc)^(1/3). So p/3 ≥ (23)^(1/3). So p ≥ 3*(23)^(1/3). Let me compute 23^(1/3)≈2.843, so p≥8.529.

But maybe this isn't tight enough.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers as I started earlier.

From the Lagrange equations:

2a = λ(b + c) + μ bc  
2b = λ(a + c) + μ ac  
2c = λ(a + b) + μ ab  

Assuming a = b, which we did earlier, gives a solution. But perhaps the minimal occurs when all a, b, c are distinct.

Wait, but in case 2, when a = b, we found a smaller a² + b² + c², so maybe that's the minimal.

Wait, let me compute the a² + b² + c² for case 2 numerically.

From above: a≈3.898, so a²≈15.19, c≈1.513, c²≈2.289.

So a² + b² + c²≈15.19 +15.19 +2.289≈32.669.

So r²≈32.669 /4≈8.167.

But wait, in case 1, a=2, so a²=4, c=5.75, c²≈33.0625.

So a² + b² + c²≈4 +4 +33.0625≈41.0625.

Then r²≈41.0625 /4≈10.2656.

So case 2 gives a smaller r², which is better.

But is there a case where a, b, c are all different and give an even smaller a² + b² + c²?

I'm not sure, but maybe case 2 is the minimal because when two variables are equal, sometimes that gives extrema in symmetric situations.

Wait, let's think about the Lagrange multiplier approach again.

We had the equations:

2a = λ(b + c) + μ bc  
2b = λ(a + c) + μ ac  
2c = λ(a + b) + μ ab

If a = b, then the first two equations become the same. Let me write them:

2a = λ(a + c) + μ ac  
2a = λ(a
