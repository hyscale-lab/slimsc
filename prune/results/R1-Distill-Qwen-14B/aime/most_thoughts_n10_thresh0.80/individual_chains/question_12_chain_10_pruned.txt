Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let me visualize the grid:

```
a b c
d e f
```

Each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit from 0 to 9. The two numbers formed left to right are "abc" and "def". So, the first number is 100a + 10b + c, and the second is 100d + 10e + f. Their sum is 999, so:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Similarly, the three numbers formed top to bottom are "ad", "be", and "cf". Wait, no, actually, each column is a number? Wait, the problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom". Hmm, the example given is:

8+9+81=99. Wait, in the example grid:

0 0 8

9 9 1

So reading top to bottom, each column is a number: 09, 09, 81. But 09 is just 9, so 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Oh, I see. So each column is a two-digit number, right? Wait, no, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns, so each column has two digits, which form a two-digit number when read top to bottom. So each column is a number, and their sum is 99.

So, for the grid:

a b c

d e f

The three numbers are ad, be, cf. So their sum is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, now I have two equations:

1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

2) 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I need to find all possible digits a, b, c, d, e, f that satisfy both equations.

Let me try to simplify these equations. Let's denote S = 100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f =999.

And T = (10a +d) + (10b +e) + (10c +f) =99.

Let me write S and T more clearly:

S = 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

T = (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) =99

I can expand T:

T = 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f =99

Which is T = 10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f =99

So, we have two equations:

Equation 1: 100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f = 999

Equation 2: 10a +10b +10c +d +e +f =99

I can try to subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate some variables.

Let me compute Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

(100a -10a) + (10b -10b) + (c -10c) + (100d -d) + (10e -e) + (f -f) = 999 -99

Calculating each term:

90a + 0b -9c +99d +9e +0f =900

So:

90a -9c +99d +9e =900

We can divide the entire equation by 9 to simplify:

10a - c +11d + e =100

So, 10a - c +11d + e =100. Let me note this as Equation 3.

So now, Equation 3: 10a - c +11d + e =100

And Equation 2 is 10a +10b +10c +d +e +f =99.

Hmm, perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others.

Wait, let me think about the variables:

a, b, c, d, e, f are digits, so each ranges from 0 to 9.

In the first row, a is the hundreds digit of a 3-digit number, so a can be 0? Wait, in the example, a is 0. So yes, a can be 0.

But for the 2-digit numbers in the columns, the first digit is a, d, b, e, c, f. Wait no, the
