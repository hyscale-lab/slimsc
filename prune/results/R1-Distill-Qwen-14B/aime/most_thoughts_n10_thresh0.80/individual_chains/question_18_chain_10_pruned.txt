Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I know a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Since it's regular, it's symmetric, which might help in counting the rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a large number of sides like a dodecagon, the number of possible rectangles depends on the number of ways you can choose two pairs of parallel sides. Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, sides are only adjacent to specific other sides, but the sides and diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a dodecagon, the sides can be of different lengths when they connect vertices that are further apart. So, the number of possible diagonals is more than the sides.

But for rectangles, I think it's about selecting two pairs of parallel lines. Since a regular dodecagon can be inscribed in a circle, the sides and diagonals correspond to chords of the circle. For the chords to be parallel, their corresponding arcs must be equal in measure. So, the key might be in the angles subtended by these chords at the center of the circle.

Let me think. The central angles for the sides of the dodecagon are 360/12 = 30 degrees each. So, each side subtends a 30-degree angle. Now, diagonals can subtend angles that are multiples of 30 degrees, right? For example, a diagonal connecting two vertices with one vertex in between would subtend 60 degrees, and so on.

But for two chords to be parallel, their central angles must be equal, and they must be in the same rotational position around the circle. Wait, no, that's not entirely accurate. Actually, in a regular polygon, two chords are parallel if the central angles they subtend are either equal or supplementary. Wait, no, in a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, two chords are parallel if their central angles are equal in measure but opposite in direction, or if one is the supplement of the other.

Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps in a regular polygon, sides that are k steps apart are parallel if the number of steps is a certain number. Hmm, perhaps I should recall that in regular polygons, sides separated by a certain number of edges are parallel. For example, in a regular hexagon, each pair of opposite sides are parallel.

In a regular dodecagon, I think that sides separated by a certain number of vertices are parallel. Let me check: since each central angle is 30 degrees, the angle between adjacent sides is 30 degrees. So, for two sides to be parallel, the angle between them must be 180 degrees apart? Wait, no, because in a circle, two chords are parallel if their corresponding central angles are either equal and in the same rotational direction or if one is the reflection of the other across a diameter.

Wait, maybe it's simpler. For a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a dodecagon, sides that are opposite each other are parallel. So, in a dodecagon, each side has a parallel side six steps away. So, there are 6 pairs of parallel sides.

But wait, that's just the sides. The diagonals can also be parallel to each other. For example, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between (so skipping one vertex) would subtend a central angle of 2*30=60 degrees. Would there be other diagonals that are parallel to this?

Yes, if another diagonal skips the same number of vertices, they would be parallel. So, for a dodecagon, the number of directions for diagonals would be based on how many vertices they skip.

Wait, each chord can be characterized by the number of vertices it skips. So, for a dodecagon, the possible step sizes are 1 (the sides), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But steps beyond 6 would just mirror the steps less than 6, so for example, step 7 is the same as step 5 in the other direction, since 12-7=5.

So, the diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip. Each step size corresponds to a certain length and a certain central angle.

Now, for two chords to be parallel, their
