Okay, so I have this math problem here about a list of positive integers with some specific properties. Let me break down the problem and try to figure it out step by step.

First, the problem states three main properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some definitions because that might help me structure my approach.

- **Sum**: The total of all numbers in the list is 30.
- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. It's unique here, so only 9 can be the mode.
- **Median**: The middle number when the list is ordered. And in this case, the median isn't even in the list. That's a bit tricky.

So, the list is made of positive integers. Let me think about the mode first. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. That means 9 has to occur at least twice, and more than any other number. So, if I have other numbers, they can appear at most once less than the number of times 9 appears.

Wait, no. Let me correct that: the mode is the number that appears more frequently than any other number. So if 9 is the mode, it has to appear more times than any other number. So, for example, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let me think about the structure of the list.

Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, that tells me something about the length of the list. The median is the middle value, so for a list with an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. For an even number, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is an integer not present in the list.

Wait, but the median is an integer, so if the list has an even number of elements, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer not in the list. That's a bit complicated. Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is an integer not in the list. But that can't be, because the median is one of the elements in the list when the number of elements is odd. So, that suggests that the list must have an even number of elements because the median is not in the list.

Wait, let me clarify. Suppose the list has n elements. If n is odd, say n=5, the median is the 3rd element when ordered. That element is part of the list, so the median is in the list. But our problem says the median is not in the list, so n cannot be odd. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. So n is even.

Okay, so n is even, which means the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th elements. Since the median is an integer not present in the
