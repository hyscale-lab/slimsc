Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit above (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is approximately (0, 0.866). 

Then, we're given a family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, with the length of PQ being 1 unit. 

The problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, other than A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. So, point C is on AB, and if we were to draw all these PQ segments, only AB would pass through C, and none of the others would. 

Our goal is to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's figure out the equation of line AB. Points A and B are given, so we can find the equation of AB. 

Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). 

Using point-slope form, let's write the equation. Let's use point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). 

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, point C is somewhere on AB, so its coordinates can be expressed as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. 

We need to find point C such that it doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in the family F except for AB itself. So, C is the only point on AB that is not shared by any other PQ segment in F.

Wait, wait, actually, the wording says "does not belong to any segment from F other than AB". So, C is on AB, and if we consider all the other segments PQ in F, C is not on any of them. So, C is unique in that sense.

So, how can we find such a point C?

Each segment PQ in F connects a point P on the x-axis to a point Q on the y-axis, with PQ having length 1. So, for each such PQ, we can parameterize it.

Let me think. Let’s parameterize point P as (p, 0) and point Q as (0, q). Then, since PQ is a unit length segment, the distance between P and Q is 1. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, each segment PQ corresponds to points (p,0) and (0,q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Thus, the family F is all such PQ segments with p ≥ 0 and q ≥ 0 because we're in the first quadrant.

Now, any such segment PQ can be described parametrically. Let me see. The parametric equation of PQ can be written as (p - pt, qt) where t ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, more precisely, for t in [0,1], the point on PQ is (p(1 - t), q t). Because when t=0, we're at P (p,0), and when t=1, we're at Q (0,q).

Alternatively, another way to write it is (p(1 - s), q s) where s ∈ [0,1].

So, any point on PQ is of the form (p(1 - s), q s) for some s between 0 and 1.

Now, for our point C = (x, y) on AB, we want that C is not on any other PQ segment except AB.

Which means, for any other PQ in F, (x, y) cannot be expressed in the form (p(1 - s), q s) for some p, q with p^2 + q^2 = 1, and s ∈ [0,1], unless PQ is AB itself.

So, our goal is to find (x, y) on AB such that the only (p, q) and s that satisfy x = p(1 - s) and y = q s are those corresponding to AB.

Wait, but AB itself is a segment PQ in F. So, let's find what PQ corresponds to AB.

Wait, in our problem, AB is a segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, in terms of PQ, P is A(1/2, 0), and Q is B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, for AB, p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2. Check: p^2 + q^2 = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1, so yes, it's in F.

So, AB is one of the segments in F.

So, the point C is on AB, so it can be expressed as (p(1 - s), q s) where p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, and s ∈ [0,1]. So, that's AB.

But we need that for any other p', q' with (p')² + (q')² = 1, the point (x, y) cannot be expressed as (p'(1 - s'), q' s') for any s' ∈ [0,1].

So, we need to find (x, y) on AB such that the only solution to x = p'(1 - s') and y = q' s' is when (p', q') = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2) and s' ∈ [0,1].

Alternatively, for (x, y) being on AB, the system of equations:

x = p'(1 - s')

y = q' s'

p'^2 + q'^2 = 1

has a unique solution only when (p', q') = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, how can we ensure that?

Let me think. Suppose that for point C = (x, y), the only (p', q') that satisfy x = p'(1 - s
