Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All opposite sides are parallel, and when you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me recall what an equilateral hexagon is. It's a six-sided polygon where all the sides are equal in length, but the angles can be different. Since it's convex, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, the problem says that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. That's an important property because it might help relate the sides when we extend them.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of 200, 240, and 300. Let me denote this triangle as triangle T. So, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF meet at three points forming triangle T with those side lengths.

I think I need to relate the sides of triangle T to the sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are the same length, let's call it 's'. So, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s.

Now, since opposite sides are parallel, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they should form a triangle that's similar to the hexagon's structure. Maybe I can use similar triangles here.

Wait, but triangle T is formed by the extensions, so perhaps the hexagon is similar to triangle T but scaled down? Or maybe triangle T is an outer triangle that encompasses the hexagon?

Let me think. If I have a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's sometimes called a "parallel hexagon." In such cases, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric figure. But I'm not entirely sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon to visualize it better.

Let me place the hexagon in a coordinate system. Let me assume that side AB is horizontal for simplicity. Since AB is parallel to DE, DE will also be horizontal. Similarly, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, but if AB is horizontal, then BC must be at some angle, say θ, above the horizontal. Since BC is parallel to EF, EF will also be at angle θ. Similarly, CD is parallel to FA, so if CD is at some angle, FA will be at the same angle.

Hmm, maybe setting up coordinates will complicate things, but perhaps it's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of similar triangles and the properties of parallel lines.

Since AB, CD, EF are extended to form triangle T, the sides of triangle T are related to the extensions of these sides. The lengths given are 200, 240, and 300. Maybe the sides of triangle T are proportional to the sides of the hexagon in some way.

Wait, perhaps the triangle formed is similar to the triangle formed
