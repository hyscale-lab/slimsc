Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and what they own. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on set theory, but I think I can handle this with the inclusion-exclusion principle.

First, let me list out the given information:

- Total residents: 900
- Number who own a diamond ring (D): 195
- Number who own a set of golf clubs (G): 367
- Number who own a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so that's 900.

Wait, candy hearts are also a thing they own, so actually, each resident owns at least one of these four items: D, G, S, or C. Or do they? Wait, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, actually, C is something every resident has. That probably simplifies things a bit because C is universal.

Hmm, but let me check. The problem says: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So yes, C is 900. So, in terms of sets, C is the universal set here, so everyone is in C.

Now, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're supposed to find how many own all four.

Wait, but wait. Since C is owned by everyone, maybe the way the other items are distributed affects how we count overlaps. Let me think.

Wait, let's break down what's given. The residents can own a combination of D, G, S, and C. But since C is owned by all, the way the other items are distributed might affect how the overlaps are counted.

But maybe it's better to model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me recall that for four sets, the total is the sum of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple intersections minus the four-way intersection. But since C is universal, maybe that's a known value.

Wait, but first, let me write down the formula for the union of four sets. The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C|
