Okay, so I have this problem where each vertex of a regular octagon is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer should be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. A regular octagon has 8 sides, so 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's the denominator for the probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there's a rotation that maps blue vertices to the original red positions. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the problem says that after rotating, all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red. So, the octagon is rotated such that each blue vertex moves to a position that was red. So, after rotation, the blue points are now on the reds, which implies that the set of blue points must be a rotation of the set of red points.

Wait no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me rephrase: we have an octagon whose vertices are colored red or blue. We need to check if there exists a rotation (i.e., a rotation symmetry of the octagon) such that when we apply this rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, the image of the blue vertices under this rotation is exactly the set of red vertices.

Alternatively, that would mean that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the set of blue vertices must be a translate (rotated version) of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but for the octagon, the rotation symmetries are cyclic shifts by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. So, the question is: is the set of blue vertices equal to some rotated version of the set of red vertices?

Therefore, for a given coloring, we need to have that the blue set is a rotated version of the red set. But since the red and blue sets are complementary (if you know the reds, the blues are just the remaining), perhaps it's equivalent to saying that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but the blue set is the
