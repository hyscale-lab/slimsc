Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing this hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral, all sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel, which suggests it might be similar to a regular hexagon but possibly stretched or compressed in certain directions.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. I think this triangle is called the outer triangle or the triangle at infinity because it's formed by the extensions of the sides. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, maybe this triangle has some proportional relationships with the hexagon.

I remember that in such cases, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by cutting off smaller similar triangles from the corners of the outer triangle. So, each side of the hexagon would be related to the sides of this outer triangle.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are length 's'. Now, how do the sides of the outer triangle relate to 's'?

I think each side of the outer triangle can be divided into three parts: one part is the side of the hexagon, and the other two are extensions on either side. But since the hexagon is convex and opposite sides are parallel, these extensions should be equal on both ends for each side.

Wait, actually, for each side of the outer triangle, it's composed of two extensions from adjacent sides of the hexagon. For example, the side of length 200 might consist of two extensions from sides AB and EF, each of length x, so that 200 = 2x + s? Or maybe it's just x + s + y, but I need to think carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps each side of the outer triangle is equal to the sum of the side length of the hexagon and twice some other length. Maybe I should consider the scaling factor.

Since the hexagon is formed by cutting off triangles from the outer triangle, maybe the ratios of the sides of the hexagon to the outer triangle are related. Let me think about similar triangles here.

Suppose each side of the outer triangle is divided into three segments: the side of the hexagon and two equal extensions on each end. So, for example, if the outer triangle has a side of 200, then 200 = s + 2a, where 'a' is the length of the extension on each end. Similarly, for the other sides: 240 = s + 2b and 300 = s + 2c.

But wait, I have three different outer sides, each with different extensions. That might complicate things because if I have a, b, c, I might need more equations. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is similar to the outer triangle, scaled down by some factor. But wait, a hexagon isn't
