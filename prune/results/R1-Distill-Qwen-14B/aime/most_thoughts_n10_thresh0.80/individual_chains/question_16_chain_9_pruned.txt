Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that if p² divides n⁴ +1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That means that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p² because if I square both sides, (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² mod p², so n⁸ ≡ 1. So, the order of n modulo p² must divide 8. But wait, the order of n modulo p is also related here.

I also recall Fermat's little theorem, which says that for a prime p not dividing n, n^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. So, maybe the order of n modulo p divides p-1. Let me think. Since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. So, the order of n modulo p must divide 8, but it can't be 1, 2, or 4 because n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, which isn't 1. So, the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 divides p-1, which implies that p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but p could also be 2. Let me check for p=2. If p=2, then p²=4. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's try n=1: 1 +1=2, which isn't divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which isn't divisible by 4. Hmm, n=3: 81+1=82, which is 2 mod 4. So, p=2 doesn't work because there's no n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So, the next prime is 5, but wait, 5 is 1 mod 4 but not necessarily 1 mod 8. Wait, 5 is 5 mod 8, so it doesn't fit the p≡1 mod 8 condition. So, the next primes would be 17, since 17 is 1 mod 8.

Wait, let me list primes and see which ones satisfy p ≡1 mod 8. The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. So, primes ≡1 mod 8 are 17, 97, etc. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Is 17 the smallest such prime? Let me check p=5. Let's see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25 has a solution.

If p=5, then we need to find n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. Let me compute n⁴ mod 25 for n from 1 to 24 (since mod 25 cycles every 25 numbers). Let's try n=2: 16 mod25. n=3: 81 mod25 is 6. n=4: 256 mod25 is 6. n=5: 0. n=6: 1296 mod25 is 1296-51*25=1296-1275=21. Hmm, n=6: 6⁴=1296≡21 mod25. Not -1.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401/25 is 96*25=2400, so 2401≡1 mod25. Hmm, not -1.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod25: 4096-163*25=4096-4075=21.

n=9: 9⁴=6561. 6561 mod25: 6561-262*25=6561-6550=11.

n=10: 0.

n=11: 11⁴=14641. 14641 mod25: 14641-585*25=14641-14625=16.

n=12: 12⁴=20736. 20736 mod25: 20736-829*25=20736-20725=11.

n=13: 13⁴=28561. 28561 mod25: 28561-1142*25=28561-28550=11.

Wait, seems like I'm not finding any n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. So, maybe p=5 doesn't work. Let's try p=17.

Wait, but before moving to 17, let me check p=3. For p=3, p²=9. Let's see if n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod9. So, n⁴≡8 mod9. Let me compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8.

n=1: 1 mod9.

n=2: 16 mod9=7.

n=3: 0.

n=4: 256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4.

n=5: 625 mod9: 625-69*9=625-621=4.

n=6: 0.

n=7: 7⁴=2401 mod9: 2401/9=266*9=2394, 2401-2394=7.

n=8: 8⁴=4096 mod9: 4096-455*9=4096-4095=1.

So, none of the n's give n⁴≡8 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work either. So, p=2 doesn't work, p=3 doesn't, p=5 doesn't. Next prime is 7.

Let me check p=7. So p²=49. We need n⁴ ≡-1 mod49. Let me compute n⁴ mod49.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find n such that n^8 ≡1 mod49, but n^4 ≡-1 mod49. Hmm, but I might need to compute n⁴ mod49 for various n.

Wait, perhaps it's easier
