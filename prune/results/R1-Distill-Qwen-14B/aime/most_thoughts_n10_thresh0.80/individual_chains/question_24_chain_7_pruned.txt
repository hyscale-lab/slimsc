Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the same page.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. It's called "unique" here, so only 9 is the mode, and it appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from least to greatest. If there's an even number of items, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But importantly, the median here is a positive integer that isn't in the list. So, the median must be an integer, but it's not one of the numbers in the list. Interesting.

Also, all the items are positive integers. So each number is at least 1.

And the sum is 30. So, sum = 30.

Our goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items. So, once we figure out what the list is, we can compute each number squared and add them up.

Let me start by thinking about the mode. Since the mode is 9 and it's unique, that means 9 appears more times than any other number. So, at least two 9s, because if all numbers appeared once, there wouldn't be a mode. So, the list must contain at least two 9s.

Wait, but to be the unique mode, 9 needs to appear more times than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, then 9 must appear at least three times. But let's think about it more carefully.

Suppose the list has multiple numbers. Let's denote the list in increasing order: a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ, where n is the number of elements.

Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, and the numbers are positive integers, the median must be between two integers or could it be a decimal? Wait, the median is a positive integer but not in the list. So, for example, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one, which must be an integer not in the list. That can't happen because if the list is ordered, the middle element is part of the list. Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's clarify:

If the list has an odd number of elements, say 2k+1, then the median is a_k+1, which is the middle element. Since all elements are in the list, the median would be in the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So, that can't happen if the list has an odd number of elements.
