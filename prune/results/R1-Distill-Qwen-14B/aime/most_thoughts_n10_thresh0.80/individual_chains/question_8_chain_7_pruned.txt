Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me write down what I know. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation looks a bit more complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is of the form variable squared times another variable. So, for example, a²b, a²c, and so on. Maybe I can factor something out or find a common pattern.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with symmetric equations, it's helpful to consider symmetric functions or maybe introduce variables like p = a + b + c, q = ab + bc + ca, and r = abc. But in this case, the equation isn't symmetric in the same way because the exponents vary.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the second equation. Let me see:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I can factor a² from the first two terms: a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So maybe I can substitute those into the equation.

Let me try that substitution:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So that's 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can rewrite this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay, now I need to relate this to the first equation. Since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums.

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). That gives me a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Similarly, for the cubes, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Let me plug these into the equation I had earlier.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting:

300[300² - 2(ab + bc + ca)] - [300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300[300² - 2(ab + bc + ca)].

That's 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) = 300*90,000 - 300*2*(ab + bc + ca) = 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca).

Next, compute [300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc].

300³ is 27,000,000.

3*300*(ab + bc + ca) is 900(ab + bc + ca).

So, the term becomes 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Putting it all together into the equation:

[27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca)] - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Simplify this:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) -27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) -3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify term by term:

27,000,000 -27,000,000 = 0.

-600(ab + bc + ca) + 900(ab + bc + ca) = 300(ab + bc + ca).

So, 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

So, we have:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now the equation is 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me denote s = ab + bc + ca and t = abc. Then the equation becomes:

100s - t = 2,000,000 --> equation (1).

And from the first equation, a + b + c = 300.

So, I have p = 300, s, t.

I also know that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are p, s, t.

So, perhaps I can write the equation as 100s - t = 2,000,000.

But I need another relation between s and t. Maybe I can find it from the variables a, b, c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express t in terms of s.

From equation (1): t = 100s - 2,000,000.

So, t = 100s - 2,000,000.

But I also know that for non-negative integers a, b, c, s and t must satisfy certain conditions. For example, s = ab + bc + ca <= (a + b + c)^2 / 3 = 300^2 /3 = 90,000 / 3 = 30,000. But that's a rough upper bound.

Wait, but wait, t is abc. So, can we find a relation between s and t?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the equation t = 100s - 2,000,000 and try to find possible integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ca = s, abc = 100s - 2,000,000.

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can find another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are non-negative integers, so maybe I can try to find when abc is a multiple of 100, given that t = 100s - 2,000,000.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the equation as t = 100s - 2,000,000, but t = abc, and s = ab + bc + ca.

Wait, maybe I can write the equation as 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me factor this equation. Let's see:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps factor out ab:

ab(100 - c) + bc(100) + ca(100) = 2,000,000.

Wait, no, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Which is:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca = -2,000,000.

Hmm, maybe factor:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b) = -2,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c. So:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000.

So, ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can write ab in terms of s and c. Since s = ab + bc + ca, then ab = s - c(a + b) = s - c(300 - c). So ab = s - 300c + c².

Wait, maybe that's too convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that since a + b + c = 300, I can let c vary, and then express a and b in terms of c, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let’s consider that the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000
