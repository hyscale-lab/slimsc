Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola equation is given as (x²/20) - (y²/24) = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

Now, the problem says that points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm that.

Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that means the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis because the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola.

So, the rhombus is such that its diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.

Since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, and the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, the coordinates of these points should be arranged symmetrically. For example, if point A is (x, y), then point C should be (-x, -y), and points B and D should be symmetric in some way as well.

But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if one diagonal is along the line y = m x, then the other diagonal should be along y = (-1/m) x to be perpendicular. Alternatively, if one diagonal is along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis, but that would make
