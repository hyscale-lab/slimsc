Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum should be 999, and when I read them top to bottom, their sum should be 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to visualize the grid. It's 2 rows and 3 columns. So, each cell can be represented as (row, column). Let me label them as follows:

Row 1: Cell (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
Row 2: Cell (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)

Now, when reading left to right, each row forms a number. So, the first row forms a three-digit number, say ABC, and the second row forms another three-digit number, say DEF. So, the sum AABC + DEFG = 999. Wait, no, actually, it's a 2x3 grid, so each row is a three-digit number. So, the sum of the two three-digit numbers is 999. Got it.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, column 1 is (1,1)(2,1), column 2 is (1,2)(2,2), and column 3 is (1,3)(2,3). The sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99.

So, our two main equations are:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. (A)(D) + (B)(E) + (C)(F) = 99

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

When reading top to bottom, each column is two digits, so each column is a two-digit number. So, for column 1, it's 10*(1,1) + (2,1). Similarly for columns 2 and 3. So, the sum is 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99, where a, b, c are the first row digits, and d, e, f are the second row digits.

Wait, let me clarify this. Let me denote the grid as:

a b c
d e f

So, the first number is abc, which is 100a + 10b + c.

The second number is def, which is 100d + 10e + f.

Their sum is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

So, equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation 2 comes from the columns:

First column is ad, which is 10a + d.

Second column is be, which is 10b + e.

Third column is cf, which is 10c + f.

So, sum of columns: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Hmm, interesting. Let me write both equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate some variables.

Equation1 - Equation2: 

(100a -10a) + (10b -10b) + (c -10c) + (100d -d) + (10e -e) + (f -f) = 999 -99.

Calculating each term:

90a + 0b -9c +99d +9e + 0f = 900.

So, 90a -9c +99d +9e = 900.

I can factor out 9:

9*(10a - c +11d + e) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c +11d + e = 100.

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Now, maybe I can express this as:

10a +11d + e - c = 100. Equation 3.

Now, let's see what variables we have:

a, b, c, d, e, f are digits, meaning each can be from 0 to 9.

Our goal is to find all possible assignments of digits to a, b, c, d, e, f such that Equation1 and Equation2 are satisfied, which reduces to Equation3 plus Equation2.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to work with Equation3 and Equation2.

Let me write Equation2 again:

10a + d +10b + e +10c + f = 99.

Let me rearrange Equation2:

10a +10b +10c + d + e + f = 99.

Hmm, so 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote S = a + b + c, and T = d + e + f.

So, Equation2 becomes: 10S + T = 99.

So, T = 99 -10S.

But since S and T are sums of digits, let's see what possible values S and T can take.

Each of a, b, c is a digit (0-9), so S can be from 0 to 27. Similarly, T can be from 0 to 27.

But 10S + T =99, so 10S ≤99 => S ≤9.

Wait, because 10*10=100, which is larger than 99. So, S must be ≤9.

Also, since T must be a non-negative integer, T=99-10S must be ≥0.

So, 99 -10S ≥0 => S ≤9.9, but since S is integer, S ≤9.

So, S can be from 0 to9.

But since a, b, c are digits, and if S=0, a=b=c=0. But let's see if that's possible.

Wait, if S=0, then T=99. But T is the sum of d, e, f which are digits (0-9 each). So the maximum T can be is 27 (9+9+9). 27 <99, so S=0 is impossible.

So, S can be from 1 to9.

T=99-10S. Since T must be ≥0 and ≤27, let's see for which S this holds.

So, 99-10S ≤27 => 10S ≥72 => S≥7.2. So S must be ≥8.

But S is integer, so S can be 8 or 9.

So, possible S values: 8 and9.

So, when S=8:

T=99-80=19.

When S=9:

T=99-90=9.

So, S can be 8 or9, leading to T=19 or9.

So, possible cases:

Case 1: S=8, T=19.

Case 2: S=9, T=9.

Now, let's explore each case.

Starting with Case 1: S=8, T=19.

So, a + b + c =8.

And d + e + f=19.

Also, from Equation3:

10a -c +11d + e =100.

Hmm, that's a crucial equation.

Wait, let me write Equation3 again:

10a -c +11d + e =100.

We have a, c, d, e as digits (0-9). So, let's see what constraints this equation imposes.

Let me rearrange Equation3:

10a +11d + e = 100 + c.

Since c is a digit (0-9), 100 + c ranges from 100 to109.

So, 10a +11d + e must be between 100 and109.

But a, d, e are digits (0-9), so let's find possible values for 10a +11d + e.

10a can be 0,10,20,...,90.

11d can be 0,11,22,...,99.

e can be 0-9.

But 10a +11d +e must be between 100 and109.

So, let's find all possible triplets (a,d,e) such that 10a +11d +e is between 100 and109.

Hmm, let's consider possible d values first, since 11d is a significant term.

Possible d:
