Okay, I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The first graph is y equals 4 times g composed with f composed with sin(2πx). The second graph is x equals 4 times g composed with f composed with cos(3πy). That sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me understand the functions involved. The functions f and g are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Both are absolute value functions, so their graphs will have V-shapes or maybe multiple V-shapes because of the composition.

Let me start by analyzing f(x). So f(x) is the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2. So, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Hmm, that means I first take the absolute value of x, subtract 1/2, then take the absolute value again. Let me think about how this function behaves.

The innermost part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2. So, |x| - 1/2 would be a V-shape with the vertex at (0, -1/2). But then taking the absolute value of that would reflect any part of the graph that's below the x-axis back up. So, the vertex at (0, -1/2) would become two points where it touches the x-axis. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

When |x| - 1/2 is negative, that's when |x| < 1/2. So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes ||x| - 1/2| = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So, in this interval, f(x) is a downward-opening V with vertex at (0, 1/2). Outside of this interval, |x| >=1/2, so |x| -1/2 is non-negative, and f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is an upward-opening V with vertex at (1/2,0) on the right and (-1/2, 0) on the left.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me correct that. Since |x| is symmetric about the y-axis, so after subtracting 1/2 and taking absolute, the function f(x) would have a W-shape? Or maybe it's a V with a flat bottom? Wait, perhaps I should plot it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider different cases for x.

Case 1: x >= 1/2. Then |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|. Since x >=1/2, x -1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = x -1/2. So, it's a straight line with slope 1 starting at (1/2,0).

Case 2: 0 <= x < 1/2. Then |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|. Since x <1/2, x -1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -(x -1/2) = 1/2 -x. So, this is a straight line with slope -1, starting at (0,1/2) and going down to (1/2,0).

Case 3: -1/2 <= x <0. Similarly, |x| = -x (because x is negative). So, f(x) = |-x -1/2|. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me correct. f(x) = ||x| -1/2|. So, |x| is |-x| which is the same as |x|. So, for x in [-1/2, 0], |x| is from 0 to 1/2. So, f(x) = | |x| -1/2 |. Since |x| < 1/2 here, | |x| -1/2 | = (1/2 - |x|). So, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. So, this is a V-shape opening downward with vertex at (0, 1/2), but on the negative side.

Case 4: x < -1/2. Then |x| = -x, which is greater than 1/2. So, f(x) = | |x| -1/2 | = | (-x) -1/2 | = |-x -1/2|. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, f(x) is ||x| -1/2|. So, |x| is -x (since x is negative), so |x| -1/2 is (-x) -1/2. But then the absolute of that is | (-x -1/2) |. Since x < -1/2, (-x) >1/2, so (-x -1/2) is positive, so f(x) = (-x) -1/2. So, this is a straight line with slope -1, starting at (-1/2,0) going downward? Wait, no. Wait, for x < -1/2, |x| = -x, so |x| -1/
