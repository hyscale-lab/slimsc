Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Let me try to visualize this first. 

The problem says that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D and E are on one line, as are C and F. Also, all the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That seems important because if four points lie on a circle, they're concyclic or lie on a circumcircle, which might mean some cyclic quadrilateral properties come into play.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let's sketch what's happening. ABCD is a rectangle, so AB and BC are adjacent sides. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle with FG and EF as sides. Let's note that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AD = BC = 16 and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, EF = FG? Wait, no, EF is 184 and FG is 17. So in rectangle EFGH, EF is one side, FG is the adjacent side. So EF = 184, FG = 17, so the sides are 184 and 17.

Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so EH = FG =17 and EF = GH = 184.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. So, let's imagine the line that connects D, E, C, F. So, the order of these points on the line must be such that D and C are opposite corners of rectangle ABCD, so probably D is connected to C via the side DC. But wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so DC is a side of length AB, which is 107. So DC = 107.

Wait, but D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I consider the line containing D, E, C, F, the points must lie in that order, or some other order? Hmm. Let me think. Let's suppose that the line is arranged as D, E, C, F. Then DE is a segment, EC is another, and CF is another. Alternatively, maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Alternatively, perhaps F is between E and C, but I need to figure out the order.

Another thing is that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A, D, H, G are concyclic. Since A and D are corners of rectangle ABCD, and H and G are corners of rectangle EFGH, which is another rectangle.

I think I need to draw a diagram to make sense of this, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.

Let me consider rectangle ABCD. Let's say points are labeled in order: A, B, C, D, with AB = 107, BC=16. So, A is connected to B (length 107), B to C (16), C to D (107), D to A (16). So, ABCD is a rectangle with length 107 and width 16.

Now, rectangle EFGH. EF = 184, FG =17. So, E is connected to F (184), F to G (17), G to H (184), H to E (17). So, EFGH is a rectangle with length 184 and width 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D and C are adjacent corners of ABCD, so DC is a side of length 107. So, DC = 107.

Wait, but D, E, C, F are on the same line. So, the line could be DC extended to include E and F. So, E and F are points on the line DC, possibly beyond C. Or maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

But since E and F are corners of EFGH, which is another rectangle, their positions need to make sense in terms of the other sides.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A, D, H, G are concyclic. So, let's think about the positions of H and G. In rectangle EFGH, H is opposite to F, and G is adjacent to F.

So, in EFGH, H is diagonally opposite to F. So, if F is on the line DC, then H must be somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps H is not on the line DC. Let me think.

So, the line DC is a side of ABCD, so it
