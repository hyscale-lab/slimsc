Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths. The problem says all the opposite edges are equal: AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. They mentioned this distance can be written in the form m√n / p, and I need to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: inradius = 3 * volume / surface area. So I need to compute the volume and the total surface area of the tetrahedron.

But wait, how do I compute the volume? Since all opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron might have some symmetry. Maybe it's a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which might make the volume easier to compute.

I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, there's a formula for volume. Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to model the tetrahedron. Let me try that approach.

Let me place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system. Maybe assign coordinates to the vertices such that the calculations are manageable. Let's say:

- Let’s place vertex A at (0, 0, 0).

- Then, let me place vertex B at (x, 0, 0), so AB is along the x-axis.

- Vertex C can be at (a, b, 0), lying in the xy-plane.

- Vertex D will be somewhere in 3D space, say (c, d, e).

But this might get complicated. Wait, maybe there's a better way. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is "equifacial," but that's when all faces are congruent, which isn't necessarily the case here.

Alternatively, I remember that for a tetrahedron with edges AB=CD, AC=BD, and AD=BC, it's called a "rhombohedron" or maybe a "tetrahedral crystal." Hmm, not exactly, but perhaps it's a kind of symmetric tetrahed
