Okay, so I've got this math problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths have to be of length 16, which makes sense because from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The catch is that these paths have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's unpack this.

First, I remember that in grid paths, when you're moving from one corner to the opposite, you usually have a certain number of steps in each direction. For an 8x8 grid, it's 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) moves. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for either direction, so C(16,8). But that's without considering direction changes.

Now, the problem specifies that the path changes direction exactly four times. So, what does that mean? Well, a direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right to up or vice versa. For example, if you have a path that starts with R, R, U, U, R, R, U, U, etc., each time it switches from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of runs. A "run" is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, each time the direction changes, a new run begins. So, if a path changes direction four times, how many runs does that correspond to?

Wait, if a path starts with a run, each direction change adds a new run. So if it changes direction four times, the number of runs is five. Because, imagine starting with a run, then each direction change adds another run. So four changes lead to five runs. That makes sense.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of paths with exactly five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. So, now, I need to figure out how to count the number of such paths.

I remember that the number of paths with a certain number of runs can be calculated using combinations, considering the distribution of R's and U's into the runs. But I need to be careful about how the runs are distributed between R and U.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, the number of R's and U's are equal, so 8 each. So, when we split these into runs, we have to consider how many runs are for R's and how many for U's.

Since each direction change alternates between R and U, the number of runs for R and U can differ by at most one. So, if we have five runs total, the number of R runs and U runs can be either 3 and 2, or 2 and 3, respectively.

Let me see. If the first move is R, then the runs would be R, U, R, U, R, and since five runs, that's three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, if the first move is U, then it would be U, R, U, R, U, which is three U runs and two R runs. So, in either case, the number of runs for each direction can be either 3 and 2. So, we have two cases to consider: starting with R or starting with U.

So, the total number of such paths would be the sum of the number of paths starting with R and having three R runs and two U runs, plus the number of paths starting with U and having three U runs and two R runs.

Let me formalize this. For each case, I can compute the number of ways to distribute the 8 R's into the R runs and the 8 U's into the U runs.

So, for the case where the path starts with R and has three R runs and two U runs:

The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs is equivalent to putting 8 indistinct balls into 3 distinct boxes, each box having at least 1 ball. That's a stars and bars problem. The formula is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2). Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 8 U's into 2 runs is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1).

Similarly, for the case where the path starts with U and has three U runs and two R runs, it's the same: C(7,2) ways for U and C(7,1) for R.

Therefore, the total number of such paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Wait, let me check that. So starting with R, we have three R runs and two U runs. The number of ways to arrange R's is C(7,2), and U's is C(7,1). So, the number is C(7,2)*C(7,1). Similarly, starting with U, it's the same, so multiply by 2.

But wait, no. The starting direction is either R or U, but once you choose the starting direction, the number of runs for each direction is fixed. So, for starting with R, it's three R runs and two U runs; for starting with U, it's three U runs and two R runs. So, in both cases, the number of ways is C(7,2)*C(7,1). But since starting with R and starting with U are separate cases, you have to consider both.

Therefore, total number is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Let me compute that:

C(7,2) is 21, C(7,1) is 7. So, 21*7 = 147. Then, 147*2=294.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is that all? Or are there more considerations?

Hold on, I think I might be missing something here. Because when you have runs, the order in which the runs occur also matters. But in this case, since we're distributing the steps into runs, and the runs are in a specific order (alternating R and U), the order is determined by the starting direction.

So, for example, if you start with R, the order of runs is R, U, R, U, R. Similarly, starting with U, it's U, R, U, R, U.

So, the number of ways to arrange the R's and U's is already accounted for by the distribution into runs.

But wait, another thought: each run must consist of at least one step. So, when we compute the combinations using stars and bars, we ensure that each run has at least one step, which is correct.

But let's step back. Let me think about how a path with five runs would look. It alternates between R and U, starting with either R or U.

So, for example, starting with R: R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.

Each R run has at least one R, and each U run has at least one U.

Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs.

So, the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to distribute the R's into three runs and the U's into two runs, multiplied by 1 (for starting with R), plus the same for starting with U.

Wait, no, actually, when starting with R, the R runs are three and U runs are two, and vice versa for starting with U.

So, the number of paths starting with R is:

Number of ways to divide 8 R's into 3 runs: C(7,2) = 21.

Number of ways to divide 8 U's into 2 runs: C(7,1) = 7.

So, for starting with R, 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for starting with U:

Number of ways to divide 8 U's into 3 runs: C(7,2) = 21.

Number of ways to divide 8 R's into 2 runs: C(7,1) = 7.

So, 21 *7 = 147.

So, total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Therefore, the answer should be 294.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Sometimes in these problems, there are symmetries or overlapping counts, but in this case, starting with R and starting with U are mutually exclusive, so adding them is correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is considering the number of direction changes. Each time the path changes direction, it's a new run. So, exactly four direction changes mean five runs.

But I think my approach is correct.

Wait, another way: the number of runs is five, so the number of ways is equal to 2 * (number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts) * (number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts).

Because for each starting direction, you have to split the R's into 3 runs and U's into 2 runs, or vice versa.

The number of compositions of n into k parts is C(n-1, k-1). So, for R's into 3 runs, it's C(7,2)=21, and U's into 2 runs, C(7,1)=7. Multiply them, 21*7=147 per starting direction, so 294 total.

Yes, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, suppose I didn't remember this, and I tried to model it with the multinomial coefficients.

Wait, the number of ways to arrange the steps is 16!/(8!8!) for all possible paths.

But considering direction changes, it's about the number of runs.

So, perhaps another approach is to model it as sequences of R and U with exactly four direction changes.

Each direction change corresponds to a switch from R to U or U to R.

But maybe that's more complicated.

I think my initial approach is correct, so I'm more confident now that the answer is 294.

But let me test with a smaller grid to see if the logic holds.

Suppose instead of an 8x8 grid, we have a 2x2 grid. So, moving from (0,0) to (2,2). The total number of paths without restrictions is C(4,2)=6.

Now, how many paths change direction exactly once?

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the paths can be RRUU, RURU, RUUR, URRU, URUR, UURR.

Each path has four steps. Let's see how many direction changes each has.

RRUU: starts R, then changes to U at step 3. So, one direction change.

RURU: R to U at step 1, then U to R at step 2, then R to U at step 3. So, three direction changes.

Similarly, RUUR: R to U at step 1, U to R at step 3, so two direction changes.

Wait, no, RUUR is R, U, U, R. So direction changes at step 2 (R to U), and step 3 (U to R). So two direction changes.

Wait, but in a 2x2 grid, the maximum number of direction changes is three: RURU, which alternates every step.

Wait, but in this case, the maximum number of runs is 3. Because for 2 R's and 2 U's, the maximum runs you can have is 3: R, U, R, U, but that would require four steps, which is the case here.

Wait, but in a 2x2 grid, the path has four steps. So, the maximum number of runs is four, but since you can't have more runs than the number of steps, and each run must have at least one step, the maximum number of runs is 4. But with only two R's and two U's, the maximum runs would be when you alternate every step: R, U, R, U, which is four runs. Wait, but that would require four steps, with each step being a run. So, that's four runs.

Wait, but in our earlier example, RURU has three direction changes, but four runs? Wait, RURU would be R, U, R, U. So, four runs, and three direction changes. So, number of direction changes is runs minus one.

Yes, right, because each direction change starts a new run. So, number of direction changes = number of runs - 1.

So, in the 2x2 grid, a path with four runs would have three direction changes. Similarly, a path with three runs would have two direction changes.

So, in our problem, we were looking for four direction changes, which correspond to five runs.

So, back to the 2x2 grid, let's find the number of paths with exactly one direction change (i.e., two runs).

Starting with R: RRUU. Starting with U: UURR. So, two paths.

But according to our formula, it should be:

Number of starting with R: number of ways to distribute 2 R's into 1 run (which is 1 way) and 2 U's into 1 run (which is 1 way). So, 1 * 1 = 1.

Similarly, starting with U: same, 1 *1=1. So total 2. Which matches.

Another example: number of paths with exactly two direction changes (three runs). So runs: R, U, R or U, R, U.

Number of such paths:

Starting with R: distribute 2 R's into 2 runs: C(1,1)=1, and 2 U's into 1 run: C(1,0)=1. So, 1*1=1.

Similarly, starting with U: 1*1=1. So total 2.

But wait, let me think. How many paths have three runs?

In 2x2 grid, the possible three-run paths are RURU and URUR, which are two paths. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but according to our formula, for two direction changes, which is three runs, number of paths is 2 * [C(1,1) * C(1,0)] = 2 * (1*1) =2. Correct.

Another test: in 2x2 grid, how many paths have three direction changes (four runs). So, RURU and U RUR... Wait no, in four steps, it's RURU and URUR, but they have three direction changes each. So, two paths.

According to our formula, for four runs, which is three direction changes, starting with R: distribute 2 R's into 2 runs (C(1,1)=1) and 2 U's into 2 runs (C(1,1)=1). So for starting with R, 1*1=1. Similarly, starting with U, 1*1=1. So total 2. Correct.

So, the formula seems to hold for the small grid.

Therefore, I think the approach is correct.

Hence, going back to the original problem, the number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)] = 2 * [21 *7] = 294.

Wait, but let me make sure that the formula is correctly applied. So, for three R runs and two U runs, starting with R:

The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, distributing 8 U's into 2 runs is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147 for starting with R.

Same for starting with U: 21*7=147.

Total 294.

Therefore, the answer is 294.


To solve the problem of finding the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we start by noting that such paths must consist of 16 steps (8 right and 8 up). A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right (R) to up (U) or vice versa. 

Each direction change corresponds to a new run of consecutive steps in the same direction. Therefore, exactly four direction changes imply there are five runs in total. These runs can alternate between R and U, starting with either R or U. 

If the path starts with R, it will have three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, if it starts with U, it will have three U runs and two R runs. To find the number of such paths, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the 8 R's and 8 U's into the respective runs.

For paths starting with R:
- The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs is given by the combination \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- The number of ways to distribute 8 U's into 2 runs is given by \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
- Thus, the number of paths starting with R is \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

Similarly, for paths starting with U:
- The number of ways to distribute 8 U's into 3 runs is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 2 runs is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
- Thus, the number of paths starting with U is \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

Adding both cases together, the total number of paths is \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

Therefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:

\boxed{294}
