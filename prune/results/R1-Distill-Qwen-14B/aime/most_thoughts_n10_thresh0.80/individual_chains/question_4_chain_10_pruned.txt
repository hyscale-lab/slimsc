Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this game problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with two possible moves each turn: take 1 or 4 tokens. The player who takes the last token wins. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice. So, I need to find all n where if Bob uses the right strategy, he can always force a win.

I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the losing positions as P-positions and the winning positions as N-positions. The idea is to find the pattern of P-positions because if n is a P-position, then the second player (Bob) can win.

So, let's start by calculating the positions for small n and see if a pattern emerges.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for the first player. P-position? No.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Wait, no—because Alice can also take 1 token and force Bob to take the last one. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. But wait, if Alice takes 4 tokens, she can't because n=2 <4. So Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Alice would lose. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a P-position. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, wait, that seems conflicting with my initial thought. Let me clarify:

Wait, no, n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So if it's Alice's turn at n=2, she can only take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then takes the last token and wins. So Alice cannot win at n=2, meaning n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win if n=2.

Then, n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving n=2 for Bob. Since n=2 is a losing position for Bob (as we just saw), Alice can force Bob into a losing position. Therefore, n=3 is a winning position for Alice. So n=3 is an N-position.

n=4: Alice can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So n=4 is a winning position for Alice. So it's an N-position.

n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving n=4. Then Bob can take 4 and win. Or Alice can take 4, leaving n=1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So both moves lead to Bob winning. Wait, that can't be. Because if Alice takes 1, leaving n=4, Bob can take 4 and win. If Alice takes 4, leaving n=1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice. So n=5 is a P-position.

Wait, but that seems like n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=5 is a P-position.

Wait, let me double-check:

n=5: Alice's options are to leave either 4 or 1.

If Alice leaves 4, Bob can take all 4 and win. So that's bad for Alice.

If Alice leaves 1, Bob can take 1 and win. So no matter what Alice does, Bob wins. So n=5 is a P-position.

So far, the P-positions are n=2 and n=5.

n=6: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving n=5 (a P-position for Bob). Or she can take 4, leaving n=2 (another P-position). So if Alice leaves a P-position for Bob, then Bob is in a losing spot. Wait, but if Alice can leave Bob with a P-position, then Alice can win.

Wait, no—no, wait: If n=6 is the starting point, and Alice can move to n=5 (P-position) or n=2 (P-position). But wait, if she moves to a P-position, that would mean Bob is in a losing position, so Alice can force Bob to lose by moving to a P-position. So n=6 would be an N-position, meaning Alice can win.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, in game theory, a position is a P-position (losing) if every move leads to an N-position (winning) for the opponent. Conversely, an N-position is one where there's at least one move leading to a P-position for the opponent.

So, for n=6:

- If Alice takes 1, leaving n=5 (which is a P-position, meaning Bob is now in a losing position). So Alice can force Bob into a P-position, meaning n=6 is an N-position.

Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving n=2 (another P-position). So either way, Alice can leave Bob in a P-position, so n=6 is an N-position.

So n=6 is an N-position.

n=7:

Alice can take
