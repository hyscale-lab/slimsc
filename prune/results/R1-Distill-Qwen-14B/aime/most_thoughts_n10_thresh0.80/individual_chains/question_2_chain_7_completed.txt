Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let's parse the problem. We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. They form a triangle, I think. 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. Point P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. 

There's a unique point C on AB, not A or B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. Then we need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

Hmm. So, AB is a segment from A to B. Let me write down the coordinates: A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is a line from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). 

I should probably parameterize AB. Let me find the equation of AB first. The line from A to B can be written in parametric form or slope-intercept form.

Let me calculate the slope. The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Let me expand that: y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, any point C on AB can be represented as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x ranges from 0 to 1/2. 

Now, the point C is unique in that it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. That suggests that for point C, any other segment PQ from F (with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, length 1) that would pass through C must not exist, except for AB. So, AB is one such segment, and any other PQ would not pass through C. 

Wait, but AB is a segment in F? Let me think: AB connects A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a segment in F. So, AB is part of family F.

So, point C is on AB, but not on any other segment from F. So, for point C, there's no other segment PQ (with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, length 1) that passes through C, except for AB. So, C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, our task is to find such a point C on AB, compute OC squared, and give p + q where OC^2 = p/q.

Alright, let's think about the family F. Each segment PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is 1. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, which implies p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, any segment PQ in F can be parametrized by p and q such that p^2 + q^2 = 1, with p, q > 0.

Therefore, the equation of line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, for any PQ in F, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, point C is on AB, so it's (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). Let's denote C as (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).

We need to find C such that it's only on AB, and no other PQ in F passes through it. That means, if we take any other PQ in F (i.e., another p and q with p^2 + q^2 =1), then the equation x/p + y/q =1 should not be satisfied by the coordinates of C.

But since C is on AB, which is already a PQ in F, it must satisfy AB's equation. Let me confirm that. AB connects A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The equation of AB is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1. Let me check: x/(1/2) is 2x, and y/(sqrt(3)/2) is (2/sqrt(3)) y. So, 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1. Let me see if this is the same as earlier: from AB's equation, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2. Let's plug into the equation:

Left side: 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2) = 2x + (2/sqrt(3))*(-sqrt(3)x) + (2/sqrt(3))*(sqrt(3)/2)

Simplify term by term:

First term: 2x.

Second term: (2/sqrt(3))*(-sqrt(3)x) = -2x.

Third term: (2/sqrt(3))*(sqrt(3)/2) = (2 * sqrt(3))/(2 sqrt(3)) )= 1.

So, altogether: 2x -2x +1 =1. So yes, it satisfies the equation. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, C is on AB, so it satisfies AB's equation, which is part of F. But we need to ensure that for any other PQ in F, C doesn't lie on it.

So, C is on AB, which is in F, but not on any other PQ in F. So, for any other PQ, the equation x/p + y/q =1 should not hold for C.

But how can we find such a C? Maybe we can think about the envelope of all such lines PQ. The envelope would be the set of points that are on exactly one PQ in F. So, the envelope is the set of points that are tangent to all possible PQs.

Wait, maybe that's the way to go. If we can find the envelope of all these lines PQ, then the point C must lie on this envelope and also on AB. So, maybe the point C is the intersection of AB with the envelope of F.

Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, the envelope touches each PQ in F at exactly one point.

So, for our problem, the envelope would be a curve such that every PQ in F is tangent to it. So, since C lies on AB and on the envelope, it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

So, if we can find the envelope, then find its intersection with AB, which is point C, then we can find OC^2.

Alright, how do we find the envelope of the family F?

The family F is given by the equation x/p + y/q =1, with the condition p^2 + q^2 =1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve for p and q such that the equation and its derivative with respect to a parameter are satisfied.

But since we have a constraint p^2 + q^2 =1, perhaps we can parameterize p and q.

Let me think. Since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can parameterize p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), where theta is in (0, pi/2) because p and q are positive.

So, the equation of each PQ is x/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) =1.

So, F_theta: x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) =1.

Now, to find the envelope, we can use the method of solving the system:

F_theta = 0,

dF_theta/dtheta =0.

Wait, but F_theta = x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) -1 =0.

Compute dF_theta/dtheta:

d/dtheta [x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) -1] = x sec(theta) tan(theta) - y csc(theta) cot(theta) =0.

So, the two equations are:

x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) =1,

x sec(theta) tan(theta) - y csc(theta) cot(theta) =0.

Let me write these equations more clearly.

Equation 1: x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) =1.

Equation 2: x sec(theta) tan(theta) - y csc(theta) cot(theta) =0.

Let me express everything in terms of sin and cos to simplify.

Equation 1: x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) =1.

Equation 2: x / cos(theta) * (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) - y / sin(theta) * (cos(theta)/sin(theta)) =0.

Simplify Equation 2:

x sin(theta) / cos^2(theta) - y cos(theta) / sin^2(theta) =0.

Multiply through by cos^2(theta) sin^2(theta) to eliminate denominators:

x sin^3(theta) - y cos^3(theta) =0.

So, Equation 2 becomes x sin^3(theta) = y cos^3(theta).

From Equation 1: x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) =1.

Let me solve Equation 2 for x:

x = y cos^3(theta)/sin^3(theta).

Let me write x as y cot^3(theta).

So, x = y cot^3(theta).

Now, plug this into Equation 1:

(y cot^3(theta)) / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) =1.

Simplify each term:

First term: y cot^3(theta)/cos(theta) = y (cos^3(theta)/sin^3(theta)) / cos(theta) )= y cos^2(theta)/sin^3(theta).

Second term: y / sin(theta).

So, Equation becomes:

y cos^2(theta)/sin^3(theta) + y / sin(theta) =1.

Factor out y / sin(theta):

y / sin(theta) [ cos^2(theta)/sin^2(theta) +1 ] =1.

Let me compute the bracket:

cos^2(theta)/sin^2(theta) +1 = (cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta))/sin^2(theta) = 1/sin^2(theta).

So, Equation becomes:

y / sin(theta) * (1/sin^2(theta)) )=1.

Which is y / sin^3(theta) =1.

Therefore, y= sin^3(theta).

Then, from Equation 2, x = y cot^3(theta) = sin^3(theta) * [cos^3(theta)/sin^3(theta)] = cos^3(theta).

So, x= cos^3(theta), y= sin^3(theta).

So, the envelope is parametrized by theta as x = cos^3(theta), y = sin^3(theta).

Alternatively, in Cartesian coordinates, we can write (x)^{2/3} + (y)^{2/3} =1.

Let me see: If x = cos^3(theta), y = sin^3(theta), then x^{2/3}= cos^2(theta), y^{2/3}= sin^2(theta). So, x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}= cos^2(theta)+ sin^2(theta)=1. Yes, that's correct.

So, the envelope is the astroid (x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1).

Okay, so the envelope of family F is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

Now, we need to find the point C which is on both AB and this astroid.

So, point C is the intersection of AB and the astroid, other than A and B.

Since AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which lies on the envelope? Wait, but AB is itself a member of F, so it should be tangent to the envelope at point C.

Wait, but AB is in F, so it should touch the envelope at exactly one point, which is point C. So, point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

Wait, but AB is a line in F, which is a chord of the astroid, but since all lines in F are tangent to the astroid, the point C is the point of tangency.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Each line in F is tangent to the astroid. So, AB is one such line, and it touches the astroid at point C.

Therefore, point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

Therefore, to find point C, I need to find the point of tangency of AB with the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

So, let me find the point of intersection between AB and the astroid, such that AB is tangent to the astroid at that point.

Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler to solve for the points where AB intersects the astroid, and then ensure that it is tangent there.

Wait, but AB is a line segment, and the astroid is a closed curve. Since AB is a chord of the astroid, but as a member of F, it's tangent at exactly one point.

Wait, maybe I should solve for the intersection points of AB and the astroid, and then find which one is the tangency point.

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

The astroid is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

Let me substitute y from AB into the astroid equation.

So, x^{2/3} + [ (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 )^{2/3} ] =1.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can simplify.

Let me denote t = x^{2/3}, so x = t^{3/2}.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, let me raise both sides to the power of 3/2 to make it easier.

Alternatively, let me write both equations in terms of x and y.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parametrize AB in terms of a parameter and substitute into the astroid.

Let me parametrize AB as follows: starting from A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me use a parameter s from 0 to1.

So, x = (1/2)(1 - s), y = (sqrt(3)/2) s.

So, substituting into the astroid equation:

x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = [ (1/2 (1 - s) )^{2/3} ] + [ ( sqrt(3)/2 s )^{2/3} ] =1.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1/2)^{2/3} (1 - s)^{2/3} = (2^{-1})^{2/3} (1 - s)^{2/3} = 2^{-2/3} (1 - s)^{2/3}.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2)^{2/3} s^{2/3}.

Let me compute (sqrt(3)/2)^{2/3}:

sqrt(3) is 3^{1/2}, so (3^{1/2}/2)^{2/3} = 3^{(1/2)*(2/3)} / 2^{2/3} = 3^{1/3} / 2^{2/3}.

So, the second term is 3^{1/3} / 2^{2/3} * s^{2/3}.

So, the equation becomes:

2^{-2/3} (1 - s)^{2/3} + (3^{1/3}/2^{2/3}) s^{2/3} =1.

Let me factor out 2^{-2/3}:

2^{-2/3} [ (1 - s)^{2/3} + 3^{1/3} s^{2/3} ] =1.

Multiply both sides by 2^{2/3}:

(1 - s)^{2/3} + 3^{1/3} s^{2/3} = 2^{2/3}.

Hmm, this equation is a bit tricky, but perhaps I can let t = s^{1/3}, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let u = s^{2/3}, so s = u^{3/2}.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can write (1 - s)^{2/3} as [ (1 - s)^2 ]^{1/3} and similarly for s.

Alternatively, perhaps I can raise both sides to the power of 3 to eliminate the cube roots.

Wait, but the equation is:

(1 - s)^{2/3} + 3^{1/3} s^{2/3} = 2^{2/3}.

Let me denote a = (1 - s)^{1/3}, b = s^{1/3}.

Then, the equation becomes a^2 + 3^{1/3} b^2 = 2^{2/3}.

Also, since a^3 + b^3 = (1 - s) + s =1.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me think of s in terms of t, such that t = s / (1 - s). Maybe that substitution might help.

But perhaps I can consider the equation numerically. Let me see.

Wait, but maybe it's better to find where AB is tangent to the astroid. Since AB is a member of F, and each member is tangent to the astroid, the point C is the point of tangency.

So, perhaps I can compute the derivative of the astroid and set it equal to the slope of AB to find the point of tangency.

The astroid is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

Differentiating implicitly:

(2/3)x^{-1/3} + (2/3)y^{-1/3} dy/dx =0.

So, dy/dx = - [ (2/3)x^{-1/3} ] / [ (2/3)y^{-1/3} ] = - [ y^{1/3} / x^{1/3} ].

So, the slope of the astroid at any point (x, y) is - (y/x)^{1/3}.

The slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

So, at point C, the slope of the astroid is equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

Therefore,

- (y/x)^{1/3} = -sqrt(3).

Simplify:

(y/x)^{1/3} = sqrt(3).

Cube both sides:

y/x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3 * sqrt(3).

So, y = 3 sqrt(3) x.

But wait, point C is on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, combining these two equations:

From astroid slope condition: y = 3 sqrt(3) x.

From AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Set equal:

3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Bring the -sqrt(3) x to the left:

3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.

Combine like terms:

4 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4 x = 1/2.

So, x = (1/2)/4 = 1/8.

Then, y = 3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = 3 sqrt(3)/8.

So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Wait, but let's check if this point lies on the astroid.

Compute x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}:

( (1/8)^{2/3} ) + ( (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^{2/3} )

First term: (1/8)^{2/3} = (1^{2/3}) / (8^{2/3}) )= 1 / ( (8^{1/3})^2 )= 1/(2^2) = 1/4.

Second term: (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^{2/3}.

Let me compute this:

First, 3 sqrt(3) = 3 * 3^{1/2} = 3^{3/2}.

So, 3 sqrt(3)/8 = 3^{3/2}/8.

So, (3^{3/2}/8)^{2/3} = (3^{3/2})^{2/3} / (8)^{2/3} )= 3^{(3/2)*(2/3)} / (8^{1/3})^2 )= 3^{1} / (2^2) )= 3/4.

So, x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1/4 + 3/4 =1. Yes, it satisfies the astroid equation.

Good, so point C is indeed (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Now, let's compute OC squared, which is x^2 + y^2.

Compute x^2: (1/8)^2 =1/64.

Compute y^2: (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (9 * 3)/64 =27/64.

So, x^2 + y^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 =28/64 =7/16.

So, OC^2=7/16. Therefore, p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me double-check the calculation of y^2: (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.

Yes, that's 9*(3)/64=27/64.

And x^2 is 1/64, so total is 28/64=7/16. Yep.

So, the answer is 7 + 16=23.


To solve the problem, we first identify the points and the family of segments. Points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \) form a line segment \( \overline{AB} \) of unit length. The family \( \mathcal{F} \) consists of unit-length segments \( \overline{PQ} \) with \( P \) on the x-axis and \( Q \) on the y-axis.

The equation of line \( \overline{AB} \) is derived as \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). We need to find the point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) that does not lie on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \). This point \( C \) is where \( \overline{AB} \) is tangent to the envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \).

The envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \) is found to be the astroid \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \). To find the point of tangency, we equate the slope of \( \overline{AB} \) (which is \( -\sqrt{3} \)) to the derivative of the astroid at the point of tangency. Solving this, we find the coordinates of \( C \) to be \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

Finally, we compute \( OC^2 \) as \( \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16} \). Thus, \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \), giving \( p + q = 23 \).

\boxed{23}
