Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let's see, triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. They tell me that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling some properties.

First, the circumradius R is given as 13. The inradius r is 6. So, R = 13, r = 6.

They also mention that IA is perpendicular to OI. That must be a key piece of information. So, IA ⊥ OI.

I remember that in a triangle, the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. The line OI connects these two centers, and in this case, IA is perpendicular to it.

Let me think about the positions of O and I. In some triangles, like in an isosceles triangle, O and I lie along the same line (the altitude/median), but in general, they can be different.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can use some coordinate geometry here. Let's try setting up a coordinate system.

Let me place point I at the origin (0, 0) to simplify calculations. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and assuming IA is along the y-axis, then OI must be along the x-axis. Wait, but IA is a segment from I to A, so if IA is perpendicular to OI, which is a line from O to I, then if I is at (0,0), O is somewhere along the x-axis, say at (h, 0). Then IA is along the y-axis, so point A would be at (0, k) for some k.

Wait, but hold on. If I is at (0,0), and O is at (h, 0), then IA is the line from (0,0) to A, which is (0, k), so it's vertical. OI is the line from (h,0) to (0,0), so it's horizontal. So IA is vertical, OI is horizontal, so they are perpendicular. That satisfies the condition IA ⊥ OI. So that's a good setup.

So, in this coordinate system:

- I is at (0, 0)
- O is at (h, 0)
- A is at (0, k)

Now, since O is the circumradius center, all three vertices A, B, C lie on the circle centered at O with radius 13. So OA = OB = OC = 13.

Point A is at (0, k), so OA is the distance from (h, 0) to (0, k), which is sqrt(h² + k²) = 13.

So, h² + k² = 13² = 169. That's equation one.

Point I is the inradius center, so it's the intersection of the angle bisectors. Coordinates of I are (0,0). The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.

Moreover, in a triangle, the coordinates of the inradius can be found using the formula:

I = ( (aA + bB + cC ) / (a+b+c) ), but since I is at (0,0), that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe using barycentric coordinates?

Alternatively, perhaps using some triangle formulas. Let me recall that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if that's correct.

Wait, yes, I think that's a formula. So OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Given R=
