Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, we have a regular octagon, which has eight vertices. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each color with a 50% chance, and the colorings are independent. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

We need to find the probability that there exists some rotation of the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. That is, after rotation, all blue vertices are now on red positions, and all red vertices are now on blue positions? Wait, no, not necessarily. Because the problem says the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, it's possible that some red vertices remain red, but all blue ones have to be moved to red positions. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, let me re-read.

Wait, the problem says: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotation, each blue vertex is now on a position that was originally red. So, the rotated octagon has its blue vertices on the original red positions.

Wait, but the original octagon has some red and blue vertices. After rotation, each blue vertex in the original must be moved to a position that was red in the original. So, for each blue vertex in the original, its image after rotation must be a red vertex in the original.

So, the rotated octagon's blue vertices must be a subset of the original red vertices.

Wait, another way: Let's say we have two colorings: the original coloring, and the rotated coloring. In the rotated coloring, all the blue vertices are in positions that were red in the original.

So, the rotated coloring's blue set is a subset of the original's red set.

Wait, but the rotated coloring is just a permutation of the original vertices. So, the rotated octagon's colorings are just the original colorings rotated. So, the
