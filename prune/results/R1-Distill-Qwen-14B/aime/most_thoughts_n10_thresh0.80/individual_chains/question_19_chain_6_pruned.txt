Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC with some given properties, and I need to find the product AB times AC. Let me note down what's given:

- Triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I.
- IA is perpendicular to OI.
- The circumradius (R) is 13.
- The inradius (r) is 6.
- We need to find AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in a triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the area. Also, the inradius r is connected to the area and the semiperimeter. Maybe I can use some formulas involving R and r to find the sides or angles. But wait, there's also this condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. I need to figure out how that affects the triangle.

First, let's recall some basic formulas:

1. The area (Δ) of triangle ABC can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter (s) as Δ = r · s.
2. The area can also be expressed using the circumradius: Δ = (a · b · c) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.
3. The distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). I remember this as a key relation involving OI, R, and r.

Wait, let me confirm that formula for OI. I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. Yeah, that's right. Because OI² = R² - 2Rr when the triangle is not equilateral. So in this case, since R is 13 and r is 6, let me compute OI²:

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Interesting.

Now, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So IA ⊥ OI. Vectorially, that means their dot product is zero, but maybe there's a more geometric way to approach this.

I should probably draw the triangle ABC, mark O and I, and see where IA and OI are. IA is the line from incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the line from circumcenter O to incenter I. They are perpendicular. So maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, OI is a vector from I (which is at (0,0)) to O. Let's denote O as (h, k). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector IA should have a direction such that its dot product with the vector OI is zero.

Wait, IA is from I (0,0) to A. Let's denote point A as (x, y). Then vector
