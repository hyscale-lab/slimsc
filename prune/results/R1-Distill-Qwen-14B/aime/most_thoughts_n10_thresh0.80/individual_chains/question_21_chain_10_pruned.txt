Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.

The problem says that for an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied. First, n has exactly two digits when expressed in base b. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_{13}, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). 

Alright, so I need to find the least integer b (b ≥ 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, more than ten numbers n that are two-digit in base b, with their digits adding up to sqrt(n). Hmm.

Let me break this down. First, let's represent n in base b. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. So a ≥ 1, and c can be from 0 to b-1.

The sum of the digits is a + c, and this should equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c. That means n = (a + c)^2.

But also, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number, which is 10_b = b in decimal) and b^2 - 1 (the largest two-digit number, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1).

So putting it all together, we have:

n = (a + c)^2, and n = a*b + c.

So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me write that equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for b.

Expanding the left side: a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c.

Let me bring all terms to one side: a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe rearrange terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a*b.

So, b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a.

Simplify numerator: a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a(a + 2c) + c(c - 1).

Alternatively, I can factor this as:

b = [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c]/a = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

Wait, but since b must be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

So, let me note that: a must divide (c^2 - c). So, a | (c^2 - c). Which implies that a divides c(c -1). Since a and c are digits in base b, a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is at least 0 and at most b-1.

Wait, but a is the first digit, so a must be at least 1, but in our equation, a is in the denominator, so a must be a positive integer.

So, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. So, a divides c(c - 1). Because a and c are digits in base b, which is at least 2, so c can be 0, 1, ..., b-1.

So, let me think about possible values of a and c.

Since a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1, but also, since n = a*b + c must satisfy n = (a + c)^2, which is at least (1 + 0)^2 = 1, but n must also be at least b.

Wait, so n = (a + c)^2 must be ≥ b.

But n is also equal to a*b + c, which is less than b^2 (since a < b and c < b, so a*b + c < b^2). So, (a + c)^2 < b^2, which implies that a + c < b. Wait, not necessarily, because (a
