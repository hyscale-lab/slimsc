Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. Usually, these involve figuring out the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's try to model this. Let me denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). A position n is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there's at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

Since the game ends when the last token is taken, n=0 is a losing position because the player can't make a move. Wait, no—if n=0, the game is already over, so the player who is supposed to move loses. So, n=0 is a losing position.

Let me start by listing the positions from 0 upwards and see if I can find a pattern.

n=0: losing (L)
n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So W.
n=2: Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Wait, no—if n=2, if I take 1, opponent is left with n=1, which is a W for them. So they can win. Alternatively, can I take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 <4. So the only move is to take 1, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent. So n=2 is losing (L). Wait, no—wait, I think I'm confused.

Wait, n=1: taking 1 token would leave 0, which is L for the opponent, meaning the current player can win. So n=1 is W.

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 (W for the opponent). Or take 4, which isn't possible. So the only move leads to opponent
