Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

"Let \( N \) be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let \( Q \) and \( R \) be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when \( N \) is divided by 1000. Find \( Q + R \)."

Alright, so first off, \( N \) is a four-digit number. That means it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property here is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. We need to find the greatest such \( N \), then compute \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient when \( N \) is divided by 1000, and \( R \) is the remainder.

So, breaking it down, I need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that for each digit in \( N \), if I replace that digit with 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I have \( N \), I need to divide it by 1000, take the quotient and remainder, and add them together.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since \( N \) is a four-digit number, let's denote it as \( N = \overline{abcd} \), where \( a, b, c, d \) are its digits, with \( a \) being the thousands digit, \( b \) the hundreds, \( c \) the tens, and \( d \) the units.

So, \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).

Now, the property says that if any single digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, replacing each digit in turn with 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

Let me enumerate the four possibilities:

1. Replace \( a \) with 1: The number becomes \( \overline{1bcd} = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d \).
2. Replace \( b \) with 1: The number becomes \( \overline{a1cd} = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d \).
3. Replace \( c \) with 1: The number becomes \( \overline{ab1d} = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d \).
4. Replace \( d \) with 1: The number becomes \( \overline{abc1} = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \).

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, each of these four modified numbers leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 7.

So, for each modified number, we have:

1. \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
2. \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

Our goal is to find the largest four-digit number \( N = \overline{abcd} \) that satisfies all these four congruences.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can find a way to model these conditions.

Let me consider each condition in terms of modulo 7.

First, let's compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7. These will be helpful because they can simplify the expressions.

Calculating:

- \( 1000 \div 7 \): 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.
- \( 100 \div 7 \): 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.
- \( 10 \div 7 \): 10-7=3, so 10 ≡3 mod7.
- 1 mod7 is 1.

So, the four modified numbers modulo7:

1. \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod7 \)
2. \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod7 \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b +10 + d \equiv 6a + 2b +3 + d \equiv 0 \mod7 \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b +10c +1 \equiv6a + 2b +3c +1 \equiv0 \mod7 \)

So, putting it all together, we have the following four congruences:

1. \( 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod7 \)  -- (1)
2. \(6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod7 \)  -- (2)
3. \(6a + 2b +3 + d \equiv 0 \mod7 \)  -- (3)
4. \(6a + 2b +3c +1 \equiv0 \mod7 \)  -- (4)

Now, these four equations have variables a, b, c, d. a, b, c, d are digits, so they are integers from 0 to 9, with a ≠ 0 (since N is a four-digit number).

Given that N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, we should aim for the largest possible N, which would mean starting with a=9, then b=9, etc., but we have to satisfy these modular conditions.

But since a is in the thousands place and we want the largest N, we can start by assuming a=9 and then try to find possible b, c, d.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about each equation and see how they relate.

Let me write down the four equations again:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7
3. 6a + 2b +3 + d ≡0 mod7
4. 6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7

Hmm. Let's see if we can find relationships between these equations.

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6a + 2 +3c + d) - (6 + 2b +3c +d) =6a + 2 -6 -2b.

Which simplifies to 6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7. Let me write that as equation (5):

5. 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (2):

(6a +2b +3 +d) - (6a +2 +3c +d) = 2b +3 -2 -3c.

Simplifies to 2b -3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, equation (6):

6. 2b -3c ≡-1 mod7, which is the same as 2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (1):

(6a +2b +3 +d) - (6 +2b +3c +d) =6a +3 -6 -3c.

Simplifies to 6a -3c -3 ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, this is allowed):

2a - c ≡1 mod7.

So, equation (7):

7. 2a -c ≡1 mod7.

Another approach: Let's subtract equation (1) from equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (1):

(6a +2b +3c +1) - (6 +2b +3c +d) =6a +1 -6 -d.

Simplifies to 6a -d -5 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -d ≡5 mod7.

Equation (8):

8. 6a -d ≡5 mod7.

Now, let's try to see if we can express variables in terms of others.

From equation (7): 2a - c ≡1 mod7. So, c ≡2a -1 mod7.

Since c is a digit, 0 ≤ c ≤9. So, c can be expressed as 2a -1 +7k, where k is an integer such that c remains between 0 and9.

Similarly, from equation (8): d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Since d is a digit, 0 ≤d ≤9, so d =6a -5 +7m, for some integer m.

From equation (5): 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me write equation (5) as 6a ≡2b +4 mod7.

So, 3a ≡b +2 mod7 (since 6 ≡ -1 mod7, but maybe it's better to multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 modulo7.

Wait, 6 and 7 are coprime. The inverse of 6 mod7 is the number x such that 6x ≡1 mod7. Testing x=6: 6*6=36≡
