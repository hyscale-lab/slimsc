Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in probability, when we're given that an event has occurred, we're dealing with conditional probability. So I think I'll need to use the formula for conditional probability here.

The problem is about a lottery where Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen ones. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so first, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. Jen is selecting 4 numbers, and the lottery also selects 4 numbers. The prize is won if at least two numbers match, and the grand prize is if all four match. So the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. Therefore, the conditional probability will be the probability of the grand prize divided by the probability of winning at least two numbers.

I think the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), but in this case, if A is winning the grand prize, then A is a subset of B, which is winning a prize. So P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So I need to compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning a prize (i.e., at least two correct numbers). Then, the conditional probability will be P(A)/P(B).

Let me think about how to compute these probabilities. Since the lottery is selecting 4 numbers out of 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). I'll need to compute the number of favorable outcomes for each case (A and B) and then divide by the total number of possible outcomes.

First, let's compute P(A): the probability that all four numbers Jen picked are the ones chosen. Since she picks 4 specific numbers, there's only one such favorable outcome. So the number of favorable outcomes is 1, and the total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4). Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Now, let's compute P(B): the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. This is the same as 1 minus the probability that fewer than two numbers are chosen. That is, 1 - P(zero correct) - P(exactly one correct).

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the probability directly by adding the probabilities of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four correct numbers.

Let me go with the second approach because it might be more straightforward.

So P(B) = P(exactly 2 correct) + P(exactly 3 correct) + P(exactly 4 correct).

Each of these can be calculated using combinations. For each case, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k), where k is the number of correct numbers. Wait, let me think: if k numbers are correct, then the remaining (4 - k) numbers must be incorrect. Since Jen has 4 numbers, and the lottery has 4 numbers, the number of incorrect numbers is 10 - 4 = 6. So for exactly k correct, it's C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Then, the probability is that divided by C(10,4).

Let me test this with k=4. C(4,4) is 1, C(6,0) is 1, so 1*1=1, which is correct for the grand prize.

For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24. So number of favorable outcomes is 24.

For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Wait, let me calculate each term:

- For exactly 4 correct: 1 way.
- For exactly 3 correct: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.
- For exactly 2 correct: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

So total favorable for B is 1 + 24 + 90 = 115.

Wait, let me check that. 1 + 24 = 25, 25 + 90 = 115. Yes.

But wait, the total number of possible ways is C(10,4) which is 210. So P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let's compute that:

115 / 210. Let's see if that can be reduced. 115 divides by 5? 115 ÷5=23. 210 ÷5=42. So 23/42. That's the reduced form.
