Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations given are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what f(x) and g(x) are. They're both defined as nested absolute value functions. Specifically, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. These functions are transformations of the absolute value function, so their graphs will have V-shapes but modified depending on the constants subtracted and the outer absolute value.

Let me visualize f(x) first. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 shifts this graph down by 1/2. But then we take the absolute value of that result, so f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. This will create a V-shape again but reflected in parts where |x| - 1/2 is negative. So the vertex points of f(x) will be where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = ±1/2. So f(x) has vertices at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), but since it's symmetric, it's enough to consider x ≥ 0. Wait, no, actually, since it's |x|, the function is symmetric about the y-axis.

Wait, maybe I should sketch f(x). Let's consider x ≥ 0. Then f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So for x between 0 and 1/2, x - 1/2 is negative, so |x - 1/2| = 1/2 - x. Then for x ≥ 1/2, it's x - 1/2. So the graph of f(x) is a V-shape with the vertex at (1/2, 0). Similarly, for x < 0, it's the same as for x > 0 because of the absolute value.

So f(x) has a V-shape centered at x=1/2 and x=-1/2, but since the function is symmetric, it's like two Vs mirrored across the y-axis. Hmm, actually, perhaps it's a W-shape? Wait, no, because the outer absolute value makes it so that any negative parts are flipped. Let me think again.

Wait, f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So let's break it down: |x| is always non-negative, so subtracting 1/2 can lead to negative values when |x| < 1/2. Then taking the absolute value again will make those negative parts positive. So f(x) will have a W shape? Let me see:

At x=0: f(0) = | |0| - 1/2 | = | -1/2 | = 1/2.

At x=1/2: f(1/2) = ||1/2| - 1/2| = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.

At x=1: f(1) = ||1| - 1/2| = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

So between x=0 and x=1/2, f(x) decreases from 1/2 to 0. Similarly, from x=1/2 to x=1, it increases back to 1/2. So for x ≥ 0, it's a V-shape with vertex at (1/2, 0). The same applies to x ≤ 0 because of the outer absolute value. So the graph of f(x) is like a W, but wait, actually, it's more like two Vs mirrored over the y-axis, but I think the overall shape is like a W. Wait, no, for x >=0, it's a V, and for x<=0, it's another V. So the function has two minima at x=1/2 and x=-1/2, both at 0, and peaks at x=0, x=1, etc. So yes, it's a W shape.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that. At x=0, g(0) = | |0| - 1/4 | = 1/4. At x=1/4, g(1/4) = |1/4 - 1/4| = 0. At
