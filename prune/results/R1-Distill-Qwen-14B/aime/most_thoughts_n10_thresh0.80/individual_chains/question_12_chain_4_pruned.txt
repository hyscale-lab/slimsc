Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have a 2x3 grid, and I need to fill each cell with a digit from 0 to 9. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999, and when I read it top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So the first row has cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and the second row is (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).

When reading left to right, the first row forms a 3-digit number, say ABC, and the second row forms another 3-digit number, say DEF. So the condition is ABC + DEF = 999.

When reading top to bottom, each column forms a 2-digit number. So the first column is A followed by D, forming AD, the second column is B followed by E, forming BE, and the third column is C followed by F, forming CF. The sum of these three 2-digit numbers should be 99, so AD + BE + CF = 99.

I need to find the number of possible ways to fill in the grid satisfying both conditions.

Let me break this down.

First, let's denote the grid variables:

Row 1: A B C

Row 2: D E F

So, the first condition is:

100*A + 10*B + C + 100*D + 10*E + F = 999. 

But wait, actually, ABC is a 3-digit number, so it's 100*A + 10*B + C, and DEF is 100*D + 10*E + F. So adding them gives:

(100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999.

Which simplifies to:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Hmm, okay. So each digit pair contributes to the sum.

Now, the second condition is:

(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

Which is the sum of the three column numbers.

So, let me write both equations:

Equation 1: 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Equation 2: 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Wait, let me check that. Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Yes, that's correct.

So now I have two equations:

1. 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

2. 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Let me denote some variables to simplify:

Let S1 = A + D

S2 = B + E

S3 = C + F

Then equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

So, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation 2: Let me see. From equation 2:

10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

But D + E + F = (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) - (A + B + C) = S1 + S2 + S3 - (A + B + C).

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express equation 2 in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, let me think. Equation 2 is 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

But D + E + F can be written as (S1 - A) + (S2 - B) + (S3 - C) = S1 + S2 + S3 - (A + B + C).

So substituting into equation 2:

10(A + B + C) + (S1 + S2 + S
