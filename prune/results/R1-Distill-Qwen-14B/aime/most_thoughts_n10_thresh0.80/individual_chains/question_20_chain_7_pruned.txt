Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what's being asked. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except by color. I need to place some of them in the grid cells without exceeding one chip per cell. 

The conditions are:
1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and same for columns.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate the first two conditions. So, the arrangement should be maximalâ€”meaning you can't add another chip without breaking the rules.

Hmm, so let me think about this. If all chips in a row must be the same color, then each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. But wait, if a row is all white, then the column can't have a different color; it has to agree with the row's color for the cells they share. 

Wait, no, actually, that's not necessarily the case. Because if a row is all white, then every column that has a chip in that row must also be all white. Because if a column had a black chip in that same row, it would violate the column's condition. So, actually, the color assignments of rows and columns must be consistent. 

So, if a row is white, all columns that intersect this row and have a chip in this row must also be white. Similarly, if a column is black, all rows intersecting it and having a chip must be black.

Therefore, the grid's color assignments must form a kind of bipartition. It's similar to a matrix where each row and column can be either white or black, and the placement must be such that if a cell is occupied, its row and column colors must match.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this. Let's consider that each row can be either white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be white, black, or empty. But the constraint is that if a cell has a chip, then both the row and column must be of that chip's color. So, if a row is white, any column that has a white chip in this row must also be white. 

But wait, that's
