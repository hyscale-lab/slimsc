Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't pass through its center. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they are tangent along another circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, respectively.

I think I need to find the radii of the circles where the torus and sphere are tangent in both cases. I remember that for two surfaces tangent along a circle, the circle lies on a plane, and the radii of this circle can be found using some geometric relationships.

Let me consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere first. So, imagine the torus is sitting inside the sphere, touching it exactly along a circle. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus has a major radius of 6 and minor radius of 3.

I think I should model both the torus and the sphere mathematically. The equation of a sphere centered at the origin with radius 11 is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

For the torus, the standard equation is a bit more complicated. The torus can be parametrized in cylindrical coordinates. The equation in Cartesian coordinates is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z² = r², where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. So here, R = 6 and r = 3. Therefore, the equation is (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is where both surfaces touch. So, their tangent planes are the same at that point. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the tangent planes are the same. Since the tangency occurs along a circle, this circle lies on a plane that is equidistant from the centers in some way.

Wait, another approach: the centers of the torus and the sphere are the same, right? Because the sphere is centered at the origin, and when the torus is resting inside or outside, its center is also at the origin. So, the sphere and the torus are concentric? Hmm, no, maybe not. Wait, the torus is generated by rotating a circle around an axis, so its center is at a distance R from the origin. Wait, maybe not. Wait, in the standard torus equation, the center is at the origin.

Wait, no, actually, in the equation I wrote earlier, (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z² = r², the center of the torus (the center of the tube) is at the origin, but the torus itself is generated by rotating a circle of radius r around the z-axis at a distance R from the origin. So, in this case, the major radius R is 6, minor radius r is 3. So the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0), but when you revolve it around the z-axis, the torus is centered at the origin.

Wait, actually, the torus's center is at the origin, but the generating circle is offset by R in the radial direction.

So, going back to the sphere. The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle.

I think I need to find the points where the torus and sphere intersect tangentially. That is, the surfaces have a common tangent plane along the circle of tangency.

To find the radius of this circle, I can set up the equations of the sphere and the torus and find where they are tangent.
