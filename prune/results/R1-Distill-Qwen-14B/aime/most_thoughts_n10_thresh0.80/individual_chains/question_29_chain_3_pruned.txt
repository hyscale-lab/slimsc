Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, that's a cyclic quadrilateral. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, AB is the length, and BC is the width. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is the length, and FG is the width. 

Wait, but the rectangles might not be aligned the same way. So, I need to think about how they are placed. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That suggests that the points D and C are on one side of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are on the side of rectangle EFGH. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should try to assign coordinates to these points to make it easier.

Let's try to set up a coordinate system. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0) because AB is 107. Wait, no. Let me think again. If ABCD is a rectangle, then AB is adjacent to BC. So, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (16, 0), and B would be at (16, 107), and A at (0,107). Wait, is that right? Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB would be the vertical side, BC the horizontal side.

Wait, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are length and width. So, ABCD: points labeled in order, so AB is adjacent to BC. So, AB is one side, BC is the next. So, if AB is 107, and BC is 16, then ABCD is a rectangle where AB is vertical with length 107, and BC is horizontal with length 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (16, 0), B at (16, 107), and A at (0, 107). That makes sense.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH: EF is 184, FG is 17. So, EF is one side, FG is the next. So, if EF is 184, and FG is 17, then EFGH is a rectangle where EF is a side of length 184, and FG is 17. So, if I place point E somewhere, then F would be 17 units away, and so on.

But wait, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D is at (0,0), C is at (16,0). Points E and F are somewhere on the line passing through D and C. Let me suppose that line is the x-axis. So, points D, E, C, F lie on the x-axis.

So, E and F are on the x-axis. Let me denote their coordinates as E = (e, 0) and F = (f, 0). Since D is at (0,0), C is at (16,0), E and F are somewhere on the x-axis.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Let me figure out the positions of E, F, G, H. Since EF is 184, and FG is 17. So, if E is at (e, 0), then F is at (e + 184, 0), because EF is a horizontal side of length 184. Wait, but in the problem, FG is 17, which would be the vertical side. So, from F, moving up or down 17 units to get to G.

Wait, but in the rectangle, EF and FG are adjacent sides, so if EF is horizontal, FG would be vertical. So, if F is at (f, 0), then G would be at (f,17). Similarly, H would be at (e,17), completing the rectangle.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If EF is a side of length 184, then from E to F is along the x-axis, so F is at E + 184 in the x-direction, same y
