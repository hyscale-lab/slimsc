Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me try to parse this and figure out how to approach it.

First off, z is a complex number with magnitude 4. That means z = 4e^{iθ} for some angle θ. So, maybe I can express z in polar form to make things easier. Let me write that down.

Let z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Then, the reciprocal of z, which is 1/z, would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|². Since |z| is 4, |z|² is 16, so yeah, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So substituting these into the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately.

First, multiply (75 + 117i) by 4e^{iθ}. Let's compute the scalar coefficient first. 75 * 4 is 300, and 117 * 4 is 468. So that term becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Next, the second term: (96 + 144i) multiplied by (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Let's compute the scalar part. 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So that term becomes (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now, our expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. Hmm, okay.

I can write this as A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}, where A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i.

Now, I think it might help to write this expression in terms of sine and cosine, using Euler's formula. So, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, substituting these in, the expression becomes:

A (cosθ + i sinθ) + B (cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me expand this out:

A cosθ + i A sinθ + B cosθ - i B sinθ.

Combine like terms:

(A + B) cosθ + (i A - i B) sinθ.

Wait, so that's:

(A + B) cosθ + i (A - B) sinθ.

Hmm, okay. But A and B are complex numbers. So this is a bit more complicated.

Let me compute A + B and A - B.

A = 300 + 468i, B = 24 + 36i.

So A + B = (300 + 24) + (468 + 36)i = 324 + 504i.

A - B = (300 - 24) + (468 - 36)i = 276 + 432i.

So now, the expression is:

(324 + 504i) cosθ + i (276 + 432i) sinθ.

Hmm, but since we're looking for the real part of the entire expression, let me compute the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.

So, the expression is:

Real part: Re[(324 + 504i) cosθ] + Re[i (276 + 432i) sinθ].

Imaginary part: Im[(324 + 504i) cosθ] + Im[i (276 + 432i) sinθ].

But since we need the real part of the entire expression, we can ignore the imaginary part. So, let's compute the real part:

Re[(324 + 504i) cosθ] = 324 cosθ, because Re[a + bi] is a when a is real.

Similarly, Re[i (276 + 432i) sinθ] = Re[ i*276 sinθ + i^2*432 sinθ ].

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes Re[ i*276 sinθ - 432 sinθ ].

The real part here is just -432 sinθ.

So, combining both real parts, the real part of the entire expression is:

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Oh, that's nice. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, we have an expression of the form M cosθ + N sinθ, where M = 324 and N = -432. I need to find the maximum value of this expression.

I remember that the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). But wait, in this case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, so that's A = 324, B = -432.

So the maximum value is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Let me calculate that.

324 squared: 324*324. Let me compute that step by step.

300² = 90,000.

24² = 576.

Then, 2*300*24 = 14,400.

So (300 + 24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 432 * 432.

Let me compute that.

400² = 160,000.

32² = 1,024.

2*400*32 = 25,600.

So (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So 324² is 104,976 and 432² is 186,624.

Adding them together: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

Therefore, sqrt(291,600). Let's compute that.

sqrt(291600). Hmm, 291600 is 2916 * 100, so sqrt(2916) * sqrt(100) = sqrt(2916)*10.

What's sqrt(2916)? Let me think. 50² is 2500, 60² is 3600, so somewhere in between. 54² is 2916 because 50²=2500, 54² = (50+4)^2=50² + 2*50*4 +4²=2500+400+16=2916. So sqrt(2916)=54. Then, sqrt(291600)=54*10=540.

So the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the formula is a bit different. The maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is indeed sqrt(a² + b²), right? Because you can write it as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²), and φ is some angle. So yes, the maximum is R.

So in this case, R is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.

Let me retrace:

1. Expressed z and 1/z in polar form. That seems fine.

2. Substituted into the expression and expanded terms. Got (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. That looks correct.

3. Grouped terms as (A + B) cosθ + i(A - B) sinθ. Wait, actually, the coefficients were A and B as complex numbers. So, when I expanded, I think I might have confused the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, perhaps I should have separated the real and imaginary parts more carefully.

Let me try a different approach. Let me write the entire expression as:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Then, multiply each term.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Multiply out:

300 cosθ + 300
