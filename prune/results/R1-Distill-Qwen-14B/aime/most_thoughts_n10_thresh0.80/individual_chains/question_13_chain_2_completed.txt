Okay, so Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning. She stops at a coffee shop, and spends t minutes there each time. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time taken, including the coffee stop. I need to find how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes.

Hmm, let me break this down. I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. 

First, when she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the total time she takes is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, but speed is in km per hour, so time should be in hours. Oh, but t is given in minutes. I need to convert that to hours or vice versa. Let me think, maybe it's easier to convert everything into hours. So t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, in the first scenario, the total time she spends walking and stopping is 4 hours. The time she actually spends walking would be the total time minus the time spent in the coffee shop. So, walking time is 4 - t/60 hours. 

But wait, the distance is 9 km, so walking time should also be equal to distance divided by speed, right? So, walking time is 9/s hours. Therefore, I can write the equation:

9/s = 4 - t/60.

That's equation one.

In the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours. Again, the total time includes t minutes at the coffee shop, which is t/60 hours. So, the walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours.

Similarly, walking time is distance divided by speed, so 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60.

That's equation two.

Now I have two equations:

1. 9/s = 4 - t/60
2. 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

I can solve these two equations to find s and t.

Let me denote equation 1 as:

9/s = 4 - t/60 → equation (1)

And equation 2 as:

9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60 → equation (2)

If I subtract equation (2) from equation (1), the t terms might cancel out. Let me see:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = [4 - t/60] - [2.4 - t/60]

Simplify the right side:

4 - t/60 - 2.4 + t/60 = (4 - 2.4) + (-t/60 + t/60) = 1.6 + 0 = 1.6

So, left side: 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me factor 9:

9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

That's (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) ) = 2/(s(s + 2))

So, left side becomes 9*(2/(s(s + 2))) = 1.6

Which simplifies to 18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

18 = 1.6 s (s + 2)

Let me write that as:

1.6 s (s + 2) = 18

Divide both sides by 1.6:

s (s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Calculate 18 / 1.6. Hmm, 1.6 is 8/5, so 18 divided by (8/5) is 18 * (5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Which is:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, I can solve this quadratic equation for s.

Using quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

So discriminant D = (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

sqrt(D) = 7

Therefore, s = [-2 ± 7]/2

We have two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5

s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now that I know s = 2.5, I can find t from equation (1).

Equation (1): 9/s = 4 - t/60

Plug in s = 2.5:

9 / 2.5 = 4 - t/60

Calculate 9 /2.5: 9 ÷ 2.5 is 3.6

So, 3.6 = 4 - t/60

Subtract 3.6 from both sides:

0 = 0.4 - t/60

So, t/60 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is: when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how much time does she take, including the coffee stop?

First, let's compute her new speed: s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

Now, the time she takes to walk 9 km at 3 km/h is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

So, the walking time is 3 hours. Then, she stops for t =24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.

So the total time is 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours.

Convert 3.4 hours into minutes: 3 hours is 180 minutes, 0.4 hours is 24 minutes, so total 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me check: 0.4 hours is 24 minutes, right? Because 0.1 hours is 6 minutes, so 0.4 is 24. So yes.

Alternatively, 3.4 hours is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

So, the total time including the coffee stop is 204 minutes.

I think that's the answer. Let me just verify the steps to make sure.

First, found s = 2.5 km/h, t =24 minutes.

Second, at s + 0.5 =3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, plus 24 minutes. So 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes. That seems correct.

Alternatively, another way: compute the walking time in hours and then convert to minutes.

Walking time: 3 hours = 180 minutes. 180 +24=204.

Yes, that's consistent.

So, the final answer is 204 minutes.


Aya walks 9 kilometers and stops for coffee, spending $t$ minutes each time. When walking at $s$ km/h, the total time is 4 hours, and at $s+2$ km/h, it's 2 hours and 24 minutes. We need to find the total time when she walks at $s + \frac{1}{2}$ km/h, including the coffee stop.

First, convert the total times to hours:
- 4 hours remains 4 hours.
- 2 hours 24 minutes is $2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4$ hours.

Let $t$ be the coffee stop time in hours ($t = \frac{t_{\text{min}}}{60}$). The walking times are:
1. $\frac{9}{s} = 4 - \frac{t}{60}$
2. $\frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 - \frac{t}{60}$

Subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
Simplify:
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
s(s+2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
The positive solution is $s = 2.5$ km/h. Substituting $s$ into the first equation:
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} = 4 - \frac{t}{60}
\]
\[
3.6 = 4 - \frac{t}{60}
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

When walking at $s + \frac{1}{2} = 3$ km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]
Including the coffee stop:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time is $\boxed{204}$ minutes.
