Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by revolving a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the torus is created by spinning that circle around that axis.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to find the radii of these tangent circles when the torus is inside and outside the sphere. Let's start by recalling some properties of tori and tangent spheres.

A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. So in this case, R is 6, and r is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I think these tangent circles lie on the surface of the sphere and the torus, and their radii are related to the positions where the two surfaces meet.

Let me try to find the conditions for tangency. When two surfaces are tangent along a circle, their centers must lie along the same line, and the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether they are externally or internally tangent.

Wait, but in this case, the torus isn't a sphere, so I can't directly apply the usual sphere tangency conditions. Hmm. Maybe I need to think about the points where the sphere and torus touch. At the point of tangency, the normals to both surfaces must be the same. For a sphere, the normal at any point is along the radius vector from the center of the sphere to that point. For the torus, the normal is more complicated, but perhaps I can find the point where they touch.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the centers. Let's think: when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, their centers must be aligned in a certain way. Similarly when it's outside.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus mathematically. The standard equation of a torus is in 3D, but maybe I can parameterize it or find the distance from the origin.

Wait, but perhaps a different approach. When the torus is inside the sphere of radius 11, the sphere is larger, so the torus is entirely inside except for the point of tangency. Similarly, when it's outside, the sphere is inside the torus, but only touching along a circle.

Wait, but the torus is fixed with R = 6 and r = 3, right? So, when it's placed inside the sphere, their centers are aligned. So perhaps the distance between the centers is such that the maximum extent of the torus reaches the sphere.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away. So the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6. So, the center of the torus (the center of the generating circle) is at (0,0,0), let's say, and the axis is along, say, the z-axis. Then, the torus has a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r =
