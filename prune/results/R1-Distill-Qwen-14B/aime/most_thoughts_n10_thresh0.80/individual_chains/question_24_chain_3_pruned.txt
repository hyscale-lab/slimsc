Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have a list of positive integers where the sum is 30. The unique mode is 9, which means 9 appears more times than any other number in the list. Also, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting.

First, let me recall what each term means. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. So 9 is the mode, and it's unique, meaning no other number appears as many times as 9. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. So, if the list has an even number of elements, the median would have to be the average of two numbers, which isn't in the list. If it's odd, the median would be the middle number, but that can't be in the list either. Wait, that seems tricky. Maybe the list has an even number of elements?

Wait, no. Because if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one, which can't be in the list. So that would mean that there's no such number in the list, but the median is an integer. So for example, if the list has 5 elements, the median is the third one. So if the third one isn't present in the list, that doesn't make sense because it's part of the list. Wait, no, the elements are ordered. So the median is actually an element of the list for an odd count. Therefore, the median must be a non-integer for it not to be in the list? No, wait, the median is given as a positive integer, so it has to be an integer. Therefore, if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of two middle numbers, which would be a non-integer unless those two middle numbers are the same. But since the median is an integer, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, making their average an integer. But since the median isn't in the list, that means the average of the two middle numbers is an integer not present in the list.

Alternatively, for an even number of elements, the two middle numbers could be such that their average is an integer not present. Let me think about this.

So, first, let's consider the structure of the list. Let's denote the list as a sorted list: a1, a2, ..., an, where n is the number of elements.

Given that the sum is 30, so a1 + a2 + ... + an = 30.

The mode is 9, and it's unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, if the count of 9s is k, then every other number appears at most k-1 times.

Also, the median is an integer not in the list. Let's think about the possible cases for n.

Case 1: n is odd.

In this case, the median is the (n+1)/2-th term. Since the median is an integer not in the list, but wait, the list's elements are integers, so the median must be one of them, right? Because the list is made up of integers. So if n is odd, the median is an element in the list, but it's given that the median is a positive integer not in the list. Therefore, n must be even because for even n, the median is the average of the two middle terms, which might not be an integer only if the two middle terms are not equal. Wait, but the median is given as a positive integer, so the average has to be an integer. Therefore, the two middle terms must add up to an even number, making their average an integer. But this integer shouldn't be present in the list.

So, n must be even. Let's denote n as 2m, so m is an integer.

Therefore, the list has 2m elements, and the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which is an integer not present in the list.

Also, the mode is 9, so 9 appears more times than any other number. So, 9 must appear at least twice, but possibly more.

Let me try to structure this. Since the sum is 30, and the list contains positive integers, the number of elements can't be too large. Let's think about possible n.

Suppose n=6. Then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th terms. Let me see if that's possible.

Wait, n can be 4, 6, 8, etc. Because for even n, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers.

Let me try to find such a list.

First, since 9 is the mode, it must appear more than any other number. So, let's say 9 appears k times, and all other numbers appear less than k times.

To maximize the sum, but the sum is fixed at 30, perhaps fewer elements with more 9s. Hmm.

But let's think about the minimal number of elements. Let's see:

If the list has 4 elements, the sum is 30. The mode is 9, so at least two 9s. Let's say two 9s. Then the other two numbers should be such that their sum is 30 - 2*9 = 12. So the other two numbers sum to 12.

But in a four-element list, the median would be the average of the second and third elements. Since the median must be an integer not in the list.

Wait, let's try to see.

Suppose the list is [a, b, c, d], sorted in non-decreasing order.

Sum is a + b + c + d = 30.

Mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, in four elements, to have a unique mode, 9 must appear at least twice. Other numbers can appear at most once.

Wait, but 9 appears twice, then other numbers can appear at most once. So, the list would have two 9s and two other numbers. Let's say two 9s, and other two numbers x and y, such that x ≠ y and x ≠9 and y ≠9.

So, the list would be [x, 9, 9, y], but wait, it's sorted. So x ≤9, y≥
