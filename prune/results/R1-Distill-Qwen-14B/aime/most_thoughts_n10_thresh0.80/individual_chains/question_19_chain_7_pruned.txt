Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what I'm supposed to do.

The problem says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. It tells me that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. I know a few things about triangle centers—circumcenter and incenter. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle. IA is one of the angle bisectors from vertex A to the incenter I. And it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI, the line connecting the circumcenter and the incenter.

I think I should start by recalling some formulas and properties related to circumradius (R) and inradius (r). I remember that for a triangle, the area can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, the area can be expressed in terms of the circumradius: area = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

Wait, but in this problem, I don't know the sides yet, so maybe I need another approach. Let me think about the relationship between OI and IA.

I know that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) can be found using the formula OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Is that correct? Let me confirm. Yes, Euler's formula states that OI^2 = R(R - 2r). So, with R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI.

Calculating OI:
OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13.
So, OI = sqrt(13).

Alright, so the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Now, the problem says that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, IA is perpendicular to OI, which makes triangle IOA a right triangle with right angle at I.

Wait, but which triangle? Let me visualize this. So, point I is the incenter, O is the circumcenter, and A is a vertex. So, IA is an angle bisector, and OI is the line connecting the two centers. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees.

Wait, but triangle IOA isn't necessarily a right triangle at I unless IA is perpendicular to OI. So yes, that's exactly the case here. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

Therefore, in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras theorem, we have:

OA² = IO² + IA².

But OA is the distance from circumradius to vertex A, which is just the circumradius R. So, OA = 13.

So, substituting the values:

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²
169 = 13 + IA²
IA² = 169 -13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

So, IA is 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, I wonder if that helps.

Now, I know that in a triangle, the length of the angle bisector can be expressed in terms of the sides. Wait, IA is the length of the bisector from A to the inradius. Wait, but is there a formula for the length of the inradius? Or perhaps the length of IA?

Wait, I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be found using the formula:

IA = (r)/(sin(A/2))

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Or maybe it's related to the formula for the exradius? Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.

Another formula I remember is that the length of the internal angle bisector from A to the inradius can be given by:

IA = \frac{r}{\sin(\frac{A}{2})}

Wait, let me confirm. The inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter, but the length of IA is a different thing. Alternatively, I remember that in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by:

IA = \frac{r}{\sin(\frac{A}{2})}

Yes, that formula sounds familiar. Let me see if that makes sense. So, if I can find angle A, or sin(A/2), then maybe I can find IA.

Wait, but I have IA = 2*sqrt(39), so setting that equal to r / sin(A/2):

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)

So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = 3*sqrt(39) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, that's interesting. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Let me compute that value. sqrt(39) is about 6.245, so 6.245/13 ≈ 0.48. That's a plausible sine value, as it's less than 1.

Alternatively, maybe I can find A/2 in terms of cosine. Because I know that sin²(theta) + cos²(theta) = 1, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

Hmm, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

But I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful. Let's think about other properties.

I need to find AB * AC. Let me denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. So, side BC is a, AC is b, AB is c. So, I need to find c * b.

Wait, but in triangle ABC, the product of two sides can be expressed in terms of the area and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, if I can find sin A, then I can express b*c in terms of area.

Alternatively, since I know R, which is 13, and in any triangle, a = 2R sin A, but wait, that's for the circumradius. So, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

Wait, so if I can find sin A, then I can find a, but I'm interested in b and c. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find angle A, or at least some relation involving angle A.

I also know that the inradius r = 6. And in a triangle, r = (area)/s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Wait, also, area = r*s. So, if I can find s, and maybe express the area in another way, perhaps I can find something useful.

Wait, but I need another equation. Let me think.

Another formula involving the inradius and exradius, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates IA, IB, IC with the sides and angles.

Wait, I know that IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)), as we established earlier, and we found IA = 2*sqrt(39). So, we have:

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)
sin(A/2) = 6/(2*sqrt(39)) = 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Then, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130)/13.

Another formula I remember is that tan(A/2) = r / (s - a), where s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A. Hmm, that might be useful.

Wait, so tan(A/2) = r / (s - a). Since we know r is 6, if I can find (s - a), then I can find tan(A/2).

But I don't know s or a yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, I know that sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, so tan(A/2) = sin(A/2)/cos(A/2) = (sqrt(39)/13) / (sqrt(130)/13) )= sqrt(39)/sqrt(130) )= sqrt(39/130) )= sqrt(39/(13*10)) )= sqrt(3/10) )= sqrt(3/10).

So, tan(A/2) = sqrt(3/10).

Wait, so from tan(A/2) = r / (s - a), we have sqrt(3/10) = 6/(s - a). So, s - a = 6 / sqrt(3/10) )= 6 * sqrt(10/3) )= 6 * sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) )= 2*sqrt(30)/sqrt(3) )= 2*sqrt(10)*sqrt(3)/sqrt(3) )= 2*sqrt(10).

Wait, let me calculate that step by step:

sqrt(3/10) = 6/(s - a)
So, (s - a) = 6 / sqrt(3/10) = 6 * sqrt(10/3) = 6 * sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) = (6 * sqrt(10) * sqrt(3)) / 3 )= 2*sqrt(30)/3 ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute 6 / sqrt(3/10):

6 divided by (sqrt(3)/sqrt(10)) )= 6 *
