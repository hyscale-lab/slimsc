Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember something about sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how that works.

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means candy hearts are universal—everyone has them. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. 

Additionally, it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for how many own all four—so, candy hearts plus the other three. Since everyone has candy hearts, the four things would include that.

Wait, so the four things are: diamond ring (let's call that D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Since everyone has C, the total number of people is the same as the number of people who have at least one of the other three items. Hmm, maybe.

Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula for four sets is a bit complicated, but since candy hearts are universal, maybe it simplifies things. Because if every resident has C, then any set operation involving C is automatically included.

Wait, but I'm being asked about the number of people who have all four, which is the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since everyone has C, having all four is the same as having D, G, and S. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number of people who own all three of D, G, and S. So maybe I can find that number using the information given.

Let me jot down the data:

Total residents, n = 900.

Number owning D: |D| = 195

Number owning G: |G| = 367

Number owning S: |S| = 562

Number owning exactly two things: 437

Number owning exactly three things: 234

We need the number owning all four, but since all own C, that's the same as owning D, G, S, and C. So, we can think of it as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Wait, but how do we connect this with the given numbers? Let me think about inclusion-exclusion for three sets, since C is already included in everyone.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets D, G, S is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But since everyone has C, the union of D, G, S is the same as the total number of residents, which is 900. So,

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

Plugging in the numbers:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

Let me calculate 195 + 367 + 562. 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. So,

900 = 1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|

So, rearranging,

|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| = 1124 - 900 = 224.

Hmm, so the sum of the pairwise intersections minus the triple intersection is 224.

But wait, I also have data about people who own exactly two and exactly three items. Let me think about that.

Each resident owns at least C, but they can own 0,1,2,3,4 of the other items. The problem says that 437 own exactly two things, and 234 own exactly three. But wait, since everyone has C, if someone owns exactly two things, they must own C plus one other. Similarly, someone owning exactly three must have C plus two others.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, for each resident, they have at least C. So, when it says 437 own exactly two of these things, does that include C or not? Hmm, that's a crucial point.

Wait, the problem says, "437 residents who own exactly two of these things"—the "these things" must refer to the four: diamond ring, set of golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because the way it's phrased, "these things" probably includes all four.

Wait, but earlier, it says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, perhaps when it says "exactly two of these things," it's including the candy hearts. So, for example, someone who owns exactly two things could be someone who has C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, someone with exactly three things would have C plus two others, or C plus all three.

So, given that, we can model this using the inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since C is universal, it's included in all. So, perhaps the total number of people is equal to the union of D, G, S, but since everyone has C, perhaps it's a bit different. Maybe I should approach this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets and the given numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is better approached by considering the counts for exactly two and exactly three items. Let me think.

Let me denote:

- Let a be the number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S.

- b be the number owning exactly two.

- c be the number owning exactly three.

- d be the number owning all four.

But since everyone owns C, the total number of people is the sum of those owning exactly one, two, three, or four. Because everyone has C, so no one has zero other items.

Wait, no. No, because a person can have C and none of D, G, S. Are they included in the counts? Wait, no, because the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, they all have at least C. But when it counts the number owning D, G, S, etc., that is the number of people who have those items in addition to C.

Wait, but the problem says "among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring"—so that would include those who also own other things. So, the counts for D, G, S are the number of people owning each, regardless of other ownerships.

So, the total number of people is 900, each owning C. The other three items (D, G, S) can be owned in any combination, including none. So, the possible ownerships are:

- Only C: 0 of D, G, S.

- Exactly one of D, G, S, plus C.

- Exactly two of D, G, S, plus C.

- Exactly three of D, G, S, plus C.

- All four: D, G, S, C.

So, the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things. Since "these things" includes C, does that mean exactly two, including C, or exactly two of D, G, S? Hmm, the wording is ambiguous.

Wait, the problem says, "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things." The "these things" likely refers to diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts, as those are the four things mentioned earlier.

So, someone owning exactly two would have two of these four, which could include C. So, for example, someone could own C and D, but not G or S. Others could own D, G, but not C—no, wait, everyone owns C, so no one owns just D and G without C. So, all ownerships are at least C.

So, exactly two of these four things would mean owning C plus one other, because owning two of the four, where C is one, and the other three are the other items. So, for example, someone owns C and D, that's two things. So, the number of people owning exactly two things is the number of people who have C plus exactly one of D, G, or S.

Similarly, exactly three things would mean C plus exactly two of D, G, S. And exactly four things is C plus all three.

Wait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, in terms of the Venn diagram, the regions corresponding to exactly two items (each being C plus one other) sum to 437, and those for exactly three (each being C plus two others) sum to 234.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe "exactly two" refers to exactly two of D, G, S, regardless of C. But given that everyone has C, that would make the exact counts for D, G, S a bit tricky. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:

Let’s denote:

a = number of people owning only C.

b = number of people owning C and D only.

c = number of people owning C and G only.

d = number of people owning C and S only.

e = number of people owning C, D, and G only.

f = number of people owning C, D, and S only.

g = number of people owning C, G, and S only.

h = number of people owning all four, C, D, G, and S.

So, the total number of people is a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.

The number of people owning exactly two things would be b + c + d.

Because each of b, c, d represents owning exactly two: C plus one of D, G, S.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three things would be e + f + g.

Each of e, f, g represents owning exactly three: C plus two of D, G, S.

And the number of people owning exactly four things is h.

So, according to the problem:

Number owning exactly two things: b + c + d = 437.

Number owning exactly three things: e + f + g = 234.

We need to find h.

Additionally, we have the counts for each of the individual items:

Number owning D: |D| = 195.

But |D| includes all people who own D, regardless of other items. So, |D| = b + e + f + h.

Similarly, |G| = c + e + g + h = 367.

|S| = d + f + g + h = 562.

So, we have the equations:

1. b + e + f + h = 195.

2. c + e + g + h = 367.

3. d + f + g + h = 562.

We also know:

4. b + c + d = 437.

5. e + f + g = 234.

We have a total of 8 variables (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) but only 3 equations from the individual items, plus two from the exact counts, and the total population.

So, total equations: 3 (from D, G, S) + 2 (exact two, exact three) + 1 (total population) = 6. Variables: 8. So, perhaps we can find a way to express the variables in terms of h.

Wait, but maybe the inclusion-exclusion principle can help here. Let me think.

Earlier, I had the equation from the inclusion-exclusion:

|D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S| = 1124 - 900 = 224.

Wait, but |D∩G| is the number of people who own both D and G, which includes those who also own S or not. So, |D∩G| = e + h (since e is C, D, G and h is all four). Similarly, |D∩S| = f + h, and |G∩S| = g + h.

So, substituting:

|D∩G| = e + h,

|D∩S| = f + h,

|G∩S| = g + h.

So, the equation becomes:

|D| + |G| + |S| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S| = 224.

But |D∩G∩S| is the number of people who own all three: D, G, S, which is h, since everyone has C. So,

195 + 367 + 562 - (e + h + f + h + g + h) + h = 224.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

Compute |D| + |G| + |S|: 195 + 367 = 562, plus 562 is 1124.

Now, subtract (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) = (e + h) + (f + h) + (g + h) = e + f + g + 3h.

So, subtract that: 1124 - (e + f + g + 3h).

Then, add |D∩G∩S|, which is h.

So, the whole equation is:

1124 - (e + f + g + 3h) + h = 224.

Simplify:

1124 - e - f - g - 2h = 224.

We know that e + f + g = 234 (from equation 5). So, substitute that in:

1124 - 234 - 2h = 224.

Calculating 1124 - 234: 1124 - 200 is 924, minus 34 is 890.

So, 890 - 2h = 224.

Subtract 224 from both sides: 890 - 224 = 2h.

890 - 224 is 666, so 666 = 2h.

Therefore, h = 333.

Wait, that can't be right because from equation 5, e + f + g = 234. If h were 333, that would make |D∩G∩S| = 333. But looking at the individual item counts:

|D| is 195. If h is 333, then |D| = b + e + f + h = 195. But 333 is already larger than 195, which would make b + e + f = 195 - 333 = negative, which is impossible.

So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps the equation from the inclusion-exclusion is incorrect. Let me rederive it.

The inclusion-exclusion for three sets D, G, S is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

But since everyone has C, and C is separate, the union of D, G, S is actually all the people because owning C is separate. Wait, no. Wait, no, because D, G, S are subsets of the residents, but since C is also owned by everyone, the union of D, G, S is not necessarily the entire population. Because a resident could have only C and none of D, G, S. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| is equal to 900 minus the number of people who only have C (which is a). Because a is the number of people who have only C.

So, the inclusion-exclusion formula becomes:

900 - a = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

So, we have:

900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|.

Wait, but earlier, I thought |D ∪ G ∪ S| was 900, but that's not correct. Because a is the number of people who have only C, so |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - a.

So, the inclusion-exclusion principle gives:

900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|.

Which is:

900 - a = 1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|.

So, rearranged:

|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| = 1124 - (900 - a) = 1124 - 900 + a = 224 + a.

But earlier, I had |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| = 224. But now it's 224 + a, which depends on a.

But I don't know the value of a. So, that complicates things. Maybe I can find another equation involving a.

We know that the total number of people is 900, which is a + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h.

From the problem, exactly two: b + c + d = 437.

Exactly three: e + f + g = 234.

So, 900 = a + 437 + 234 + h.

So, 900 = a + 671 + h.

Which means a + h = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, a + h = 229.

Now, returning to the inclusion-exclusion equation:

|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| = 224 + a.

But from earlier, |D∩G| = e + h, |D∩S| = f + h, |G∩S| = g + h.

So, |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| = (e + h) + (f + h) + (g + h) = e + f + g + 3h.

And |D∩G∩S| is h.

So, substituting into the equation:

(e + f + g + 3h) - h = 224 + a.

Which simplifies to:

e + f + g + 2h = 224 + a.

But e + f + g = 234 (from equation 5), so:

234 + 2h = 224 + a.

Rearranging:

a = 234 + 2h - 224 = 10 + 2h.

So, a = 10 + 2h.

But earlier, we had a + h = 229.

Substituting a:

10 + 2h + h = 229.

So, 10 + 3h = 229.

Subtract 10: 3h = 219.

So, h = 73.

Ah, that makes more sense. Let me confirm the steps:

We had:

Inclusion-Exclusion gave us e + f + g + 2h = 224 + a.

We know e + f + g = 234, so 234 + 2h = 224 + a → a = 10 + 2h.

From the total population: a + h = 229.

So, substituting a: 10 + 2h + h = 229 → 3h = 219 → h = 73.

So, the number of people who own all four is 73.

Let me check this with the individual item counts.

From D: |D| = b + e + f + h = 195.

We can express b in terms of other variables.

We know that b + c + d = 437.

We have a = 10 + 2h = 10 + 146 = 156.

So, a = 156.

We also have a + h = 229 → 156 + 73 = 229, which checks out.

Now, let's find b, c, d.

But perhaps it's easier to check with the other equations.

We know that |D| = b + e + f + h = 195.

We know h = 73.

But we don't know e, f, b.

But e + f + g = 234, and g is part of |G| and |S|.

Alternatively, maybe check |G| and |S|.

|G| = c + e + g + h = 367.

|S| = d + f + g + h = 562.

Let me see:

We have a + h = 229 → a = 156.

We have:

Total people: a + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h = 156 + 437 + 234 +73 = 156 + 437 is 593, 593 +234 is 827, 827 +73 is 900. Perfect.

Now, let's look at |D| = 195 = b + e + f + h.

h is 73, so b + e + f = 195 - 73 = 122.

Similarly, |G| = 367 = c + e + g + h.

h is 73, so c + e + g = 367 - 73 = 294.

|S| = 562 = d + f + g + h.

h is 73, so d + f + g = 562 -73 = 489.

We also know:

b + c + d = 437.

e + f + g = 234.

So, let's express some variables.

From |D|: b + e + f = 122. Let's denote this as equation (6).

From |G|: c + e + g = 294. Equation (7).

From |S|: d + f + g = 489. Equation (8).

We have equation (4): b + c + d = 437.

Equation (5): e + f + g = 234.

Let me see if we can solve for variables.

From equation (5): e + f + g = 234.

From equation (6): b + e + f = 122 → b = 122 - e - f.

From equation (4): b + c + d = 437.

Substituting b: (122 - e - f) + c + d = 437 → c + d = 437 - 122 + e + f → c + d = 315 + e + f.

But c + d can also be found from equation (7) and (8).

Wait, from equation (7): c + e + g = 294 → c = 294 - e - g.

From equation (8): d + f + g = 489 → d = 489 - f - g.

Substitute these into c + d:

c + d = (294 - e - g) + (489 - f - g) = 294 + 489 - e - f - 2g = 783 - e - f - 2g.

But from earlier, c + d = 315 + e + f.

So,

783 - e - f - 2g = 315 + e + f.

Rearranging:

783 - 315 = e + f + e + f + 2g.

468 = 2e + 2f + 2g.

Divide both sides by 2:

234 = e + f + g.

But from equation (5), e + f + g = 234. So, this is consistent. So, no new information here.

Hmm, perhaps I can find another way.

From equation (6): b + e + f = 122.

From equation (5): e + f + g = 234.

Subtracting equation (6) from equation (5):

(e + f + g) - (b + e + f) = 234 - 122.

Which simplifies to g - b = 112 → g = b + 112.

Similarly, from equation (7): c + e + g = 294.

But g = b + 112, so c + e + b + 112 = 294 → c + e + b = 182.

From equation (4): b + c + d = 437.

Subtracting (c + e + b) = 182 from equation (4):

(b + c + d) - (b + c + e) = 437 - 182 → d - e = 255 → d = e + 255.

From equation (8): d + f + g = 489.

But d = e + 255, g = b + 112.

So,

(e + 255) + f + (b + 112) = 489.

Simplify:

e + 255 + f + b + 112 = 489 → e + f + b + 367 = 489 → e + f + b = 122.

Wait, but from equation (6): e + f + b = 122. So, that's consistent.

So, everything checks out, but I can't find the exact values of individual variables, but I don't need them because the question only asks for h, which is 73.

So, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given counts of residents owning specific items. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( h \) be the number of residents owning all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts).
   - Let \( a \) be the number of residents owning only candy hearts.
   - Let \( b, c, d \) be the number of residents owning candy hearts and exactly one other item.
   - Let \( e, f, g \) be the number of residents owning candy hearts and exactly two other items.
   - The total number of residents is 900.

2. **Given Data:**
   - Number owning exactly two items: \( b + c + d = 437 \).
   - Number owning exactly three items: \( e + f + g = 234 \).
   - Total residents: \( a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900 \).

3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   Using the counts for diamond rings (\( |D| = 195 \)), golf clubs (\( |G| = 367 \)), and garden spades (\( |S| = 562 \)):
   \[
   |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap S| - |G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap S| = 1124 - (900 - a)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   |D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |G \cap S| - |D \cap G \cap S| = 224 + a
   \]
   Since \( |D \cap G| = e + h \), \( |D \cap S| = f + h \), and \( |G \cap S| = g + h \), we substitute:
   \[
   (e + f + g) + 3h - h = 224 + a
   \]
   \[
   234 + 2h = 224 + a
   \]
   \[
   a = 10 + 2h
   \]

4. **Total Residents Equation:**
   \[
   a + h = 229
   \]
   Substituting \( a = 10 + 2h \):
   \[
   10 + 3h = 229
   \]
   \[
   3h = 219 \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = 73
   \]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
