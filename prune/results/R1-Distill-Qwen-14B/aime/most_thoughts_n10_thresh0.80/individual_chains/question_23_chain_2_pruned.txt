Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Hmm, let me try to parse what it's asking. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right since the x term is positive. The vertices would be at (±√20, 0), which simplifies to (±2√5, 0). 

The problem says that points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other.

I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if the origin is the intersection point, then for any two opposite points, say A and C, the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, for B and D, their midpoint is also the origin.

Since the hyperbola is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis, maybe the rhombus has some symmetry too. Perhaps the diagonals are aligned with the axes? Or maybe not necessarily. I need to figure out the coordinates of points A, B, C, D such that all four are on the hyperbola.

Let me denote the coordinates of the points. Let’s say point A is (x, y). Since ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, point C must be (-x, -y), because the origin is the midpoint. Similarly, points B and D must be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. So, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).

But wait, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, we can use the properties of rhombuses related to their diagonals.

In a rhombus, the area can be calculated as (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Alternatively, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular, the vectors of the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if one diagonal is from A to C, which is (x, y) to (-x, -y), that vector is (2x, 2y). Similarly, the other diagonal from B to D is (2p, 2q). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.

So, (2x)(2p) + (2y)(2q) = 0 → 4xp + 4yq = 0 → xp + yq = 0. So, the product condition is that xp + yq = 0.

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, and so on.

Let me write down the coordinates:

A = (x, y)
B = (p, q)
C = (-x, -y)
D = (-p, -q)

So, distance AB squared is (x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2.

Distance BC squared is (p - (-x))^2 + (q - (-y))^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2.

Since it's a rhombus, AB = BC, so their squares are equal:

(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left: x² - 2xp + p² + y² - 2yq + q².

Right: x² + 2xp + p² + y² + 2yq + q².

Subtracting left from right, we get:

(2xp + 2yq) - (-2xp -2yq) = 0 → 4xp + 4yq = 0 → which simplifies to xp + yq = 0, which matches our earlier condition. So, that's consistent.

So, the condition xp + yq = 0 is necessary.

Now, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so plugging in each point:

For A: x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

Similarly, for B: p²/20 - q²/24 =1.

So, both (x, y) and (p, q) satisfy the hyperbola equation.

Our goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals. Let me see which points B and D are.

Wait, points B and D are (p, q) and (-p, -q). So, the distance between B and D is the distance from (p, q) to (-p, -q), which is sqrt[(2p)^2 + (2q)^2] = 2*sqrt(p² + q²). So, BD squared is (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 = 4p² +4q².

So, BD² = 4(p² + q²).

Similarly, the other diagonal is AC, which is from (x, y) to (-x, -y). The length squared is (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 = 4(x² + y²). So, AC² =4(x² + y²).

But since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so we can use the relation that in a rhombus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals four times the square of a side. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to four times the sum of the squares of the sides. Hmm, maybe I should recall the formula.

Alternatively, for any rhombus, if d1 and d2 are the diagonals, then the area is (d1*d2)/2, and the side length s is given by s = sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, s² = (d1² + d2²)/4.

So, since all sides are equal, the side squared is (BD² + AC²)/4.

But I'm not sure if that helps me directly. Let me think about how to parameterize points A and B.

So, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we can write parametric equations for the hyperbola. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, parametric coordinates are (a secθ, b tanθ). Alternatively, since it's a hyperbola, maybe hyperbolic functions are better.

Using hyperbolic functions, we can write points as (a cosh t, b sinh t), but that parametrizes only the right branch. Since the hyperbola has two branches, but the rhombus is formed by points on both branches? Wait, no, because the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 =1, so for each x, you can have two points on the same x but different y's. But in this case, the rhombus has points on both branches?

Wait, think about the rhombus: since it's a convex polygon, if all four points are on the same branch, the rhombus would be very constrained. Alternatively, perhaps two points are on one branch and the other two on the opposite branch.

Wait, but the hyperbola has two separate branches. So, points A and C are on opposite branches if their x-coordinates are of opposite signs. Similarly, points B and D are on opposite branches.

Wait, but in our earlier setup, point A is (x,y) and point C is (-x, -y). So, they are on opposite branches if x is positive, then C is on the left branch. Similarly, for B and D.

So, A and C are on opposite branches, and B and D are on opposite branches.

So, points A and C: (x,y) and (-x,-y), on the hyperbola. Similarly, points B and D: (p,q) and (-p,-q), also on the hyperbola.

So, now, A, B, C, D are four points forming a rhombus, with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

So, maybe I can parametrize points A and B in terms of some parameter, say θ, and then find relations.

Alternatively, maybe I can express points A and B in terms of vectors.

Let me think of points A and B as vectors from the origin. Then, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the midpoint of AC is the origin, and the midpoint of BD is the origin. So, the vectors a and c are negatives, and same with b and d.

In a rhombus, the sides are equal, so the vectors AB and AD are equal in length. Hmm, but in terms of vectors, AB is b - a, and AD is d - a.

Wait, perhaps I should use vectors to model this.

Let me denote vectors OA = a = (x, y), OB = b = (p, q). Then, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, OC = -a and OD = -b.

In a rhombus, the sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.

Wait, AB is vector from A to B: b - a.

BC is vector from B to C: c - b = (-a) - b = -a - b.

CD is vector from C to D: d - c = (-b) - (-a) = -b + a = a - b.

DA is vector from D to A: a - d = a - (-b) = a + b.

Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides should be equal in length, so |b - a| = |-a - b| = |a - b| = |a + b|.

Wait, that's interesting. So, |b - a| = |a + b|, which implies that (b - a)·(b - a) = (a + b)·(a + b).

Expanding both:

(b - a)·(b - a) = |b|² - 2a·b + |a|²

(a + b)·(a + b) = |a|² + 2a·b + |b|²

Setting them equal:

|b|² - 2a·b + |a|² = |a|² + 2a·b + |b|²

Subtracting |a|² + |b|² from both sides:

-2a·b = 2a·b

Which implies -2a·b - 2a·b = 0 → -4a·b = 0 → a·b = 0.

So, the dot product of vectors a and b is zero. So, the vectors a and b are perpendicular.

Oh, that's an important condition. So, the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.

So, from this, a·b = 0 → x*p + y*q = 0. Which is consistent with the earlier condition we got.

So, now, we have that (x, y) and (p, q) are points on the hyperbola, and x*p + y*q =0.

We need to find BD squared, which is 4(p² + q²). So, BD² = 4(p² + q²). Our goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD², or find the minimum possible value of BD², because the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum.

Wait, actually, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, we need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi. Because that infimum would be the smallest possible value of BD², and thus the greatest number less than all BD² is just the infimum.

Wait, no. Wait, if we have BD² varying, say, from some minimum value to infinity, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the minimum BD². Because for some rhombi, BD² can be very large, but the minimum is the smallest possible BD², so any number less than that can't be a lower bound for all BD². Wait, maybe I got that backwards.

Let me think: Suppose BD² can be as small as m and as large as infinity. Then, the set of all BD² is [m, ∞). So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would have to be less than m, because for the rhombus with BD² = m, any number less than m would be less than BD². But wait, the problem is to find the greatest such number that is less than BD² for all rhombi. So, if BD² can get as small as m, then any number less than m would not be less than BD² for all rhombi, because for the rhombus with BD² = m, it's equal. Wait, but the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, the number has to be less than BD² for every rhombus. So, if BD² can be made as small as possible, approaching m, then any number greater than m would not satisfy because for the rhombus with BD² = m, the number would be greater than BD². But if we take the number as m, then for the rhombus with BD² = m, the number equals
