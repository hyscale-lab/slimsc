Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It's about finding the largest possible real part of a complex expression. The expression is (75 + 117i)z plus (96 + 144i) divided by z, where z is a complex number with absolute value 4. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

First, I know that z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. So, |z| = 4. That means if I write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z, then that should work. Because any complex number can be represented in polar form as r*(cosθ + i sinθ), and in exponential form, it's r*e^{iθ}. Since r is 4 here, that's straightforward.

So, maybe I can express z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because the reciprocal of e^{iθ} is e^{-iθ}, and the magnitude becomes 1/4.

Let me write that down:

z = 4e^{iθ}

1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Okay, so the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately.

First, compute (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}:

75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468, so that's (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}

Similarly, (96 + 144i) * (1/4) is (96/4 + 144/4)i = (24 + 36i), so that's (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So, the expression simplifies to:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. Because the problem is asking for the largest possible real part. So, I can take the real part of each term and sum them.

Recall that the real part of a complex number a + ib is just a. So, to find Re[(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}], I can compute Re[(300 + 468i)e^{iθ}] + Re[(24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}].

Let me compute each real part separately.

First term: Re[(300 + 468i)e^{iθ}]

I know that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So, multiplying (300 + 468i) with (cosθ + i sinθ):

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ

But i^2 is -1, so that becomes:

300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ

So, the real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, for the second term: Re[(24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}]

e^{-iθ} is cosθ - i sinθ. So, multiplying (24 + 36i) with (cosθ - i sinθ):

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Again, i^2 is -1, so:

24 cosθ + (36 cosθ - 24 sinθ)i + 36 sinθ

So, the real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Therefore, the total real part of the entire expression is:

[300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]

Let me combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

Which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, the problem is to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies. So, we're looking for the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay, so this is a linear combination of sine and cosine. I remember that any expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is C, and the minimum is -C.

Wait, but in this case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me write this as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So, A = 324, B = -432.

Then, the amplitude C is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared. 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, so 324^2 = (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 000? Wait, 90k +14.4k is 104.4k, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared. Let's see, 400^2 is 160,000, 32^2 is 1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024= 186,624.

So, 324^2 = 104,976, and 432^2 = 186,624.

C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Hmm, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2 is 250,000, 40^2 is 1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, (500 +40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600= 291,600. So sqrt(291,600)=540.

So, the maximum value is 540.

Wait, so the maximum real part is 540?

Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, which is correct because |z|=4.

Then, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}, correct.

Then, I multiplied (75 +117i) by 4e^{iθ}, which gave 300 + 468i, multiplied by e^{iθ}, correct.

Similarly, (96 +144i) divided by 4 is 24 +36i, correct.

Then, expanded both terms, took the real parts correctly.

Wait, for the first term, when I multiplied (300 +468i)(cosθ +i sinθ), the real part was 300 cosθ -468 sinθ, right? Because 300 cosθ is real, 468i cosθ is imaginary, 300i sinθ is imaginary, and 468i^2 sinθ is -468 sinθ, which is real. So, the real part is 300 cosθ -468 sinθ. Correct.

For the second term, (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ). Let's verify:

Multiply 24 by cosθ: 24 cosθ.

24 by (-i sinθ): -24i sinθ.

36i by cosθ: 36i cosθ.

36i by (-i sinθ): -36i^2 sinθ = 36 sinθ.

So, the real parts are 24 cosθ +36 sinθ. Correct.

So, when I add these real parts together, I get 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Correct.

Then, to find the maximum of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which is of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, where A=324, B=-432.

The maximum value is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

I think that's solid. No steps skipped that I can see, and all the computations seem correct.


The expression is \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) with \(|z| = 4\). Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), so \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\). Substituting, the expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Taking the real parts:

\[
\text{Re}[(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}] + \text{Re}[(24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}] = (300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta) + (24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta
\]

The maximum value of \(A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Here, \(A = 324\), \(B = -432\):

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
