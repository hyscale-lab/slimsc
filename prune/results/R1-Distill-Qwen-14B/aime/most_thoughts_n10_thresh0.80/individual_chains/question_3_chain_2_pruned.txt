Okay, so I have this probability problem about a lottery, and I need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. Then, express that probability as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen.

We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. That sounds like a conditional probability problem. So, in probability terms, we're looking for P(Grand Prize | Prize).

From probability theory, I remember that P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have also won a prize because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So P(Grand Prize and Prize) is just P(Grand Prize). So, P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize).

So, I need to compute two things: the probability that she wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize (i.e., at least two numbers match). Then, divide the grand prize probability by the prize probability.

Let's start by figuring out the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the total number of possible combinations is C(10, 4). Let me calculate that. C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of four numbers.

Now, the probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. Since she picks her own four numbers, and the lottery also picks four numbers, the only way she wins the grand prize is if the lottery's four numbers are exactly the same as hers. So, how many ways can that happen? Only one way: the specific set she chose. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, and the total possible is 210. Therefore, P(Grand Prize) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to compute P(Prize), which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. This can happen in a few ways: exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen. Wait, but the grand prize is a subset of this, so maybe I can calculate it as the total prize cases minus the grand prize case.

But perhaps it's better to compute it directly. So, P(Prize) is the probability that at least two of her four numbers are among the four randomly chosen. Alternatively, it's 1 minus the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, which includes the cases where zero or one of her numbers are in the chosen set.

Wait, calculating it directly: the number of ways to choose four numbers from S such that exactly k of them are in Jen's set. So, for k=0,1,2,3,4.

But since she wins if k >=2, the number of favorable outcomes is the sum from k=2 to k=4 of C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Wait, let me explain.

Her set has 4 numbers, and the rest of S has 10 - 4 = 6 numbers. So, the number of ways to choose four numbers with exactly k of them being from her set is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). So, for k=2, it's C(4,2)*C(6,2); for k=3, C(4,3)*C(6,1); for k=4, C(4,4)*C(6,0).

So total number of favorable outcomes is [C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0)].

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15, so 6*15=90.

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24.

C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1, so 1*1=1.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 115, and since total possible is 210, P(Prize) = 115 / 210.

Wait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as 1 - P(zero or one match). So, P(Prize) = 1 - [C(4,0)*C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Let me see if that gives the same result.

Compute C(4,0)*C(6,4): 1 * 15 = 15.

C(4,1)*C(6,3): 4 * 20 = 80.

So total of 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, 1 - (95 / 210) = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210. So yes, that's the same as before. So P(Prize)=115/210.

Simplify that fraction: 115 and 210 can both be divided by 5. 115 รท5=23, 210 รท5=42. So, 23/42. So P(Prize)=2
