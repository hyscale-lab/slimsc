Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right because the positive term is with x². The transverse axis length is 2a, where a² = 20, so a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). The conjugate axis is 2b, where b² = 24, so b = 2*sqrt(6). 

Now, the rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, but wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Oh right, yes, that's a key property. So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. 

The problem says that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the point of intersection of the diagonals is the origin, which makes sense because the hyperbola is centered there. 

So, the rhombus is such that its diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, and all four vertices lie on the hyperbola. 

The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the supremum (least upper bound) of BD², where BD is one of the diagonals, and then find the greatest number less than this supremum. But wait, actually, the question is phrased as "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." Wait, that wording is a bit confusing. Wait, no, let me read again: "Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." Hmm
