Alright, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the elements of set A. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. So Alice picks a set A, and based on that, Bob creates a list of sets B. Each B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and the maximum element in each B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I have to find the sum of elements in A.

Let me break this down. First, what determines the number of sets B that Bob can list? Each B is finite and nonempty, and the max element of B is in A. So for each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum?

Suppose A has elements a1, a2, ..., an. For each ai, the number of possible sets B where ai is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, because the other elements of B must be less than ai. So for each ai, the number of such sets is 2^{ai - 1}.

Wait, let me explain that again. If ai is the maximum, then all other elements of B must be from the positive integers less than ai. But wait, no, they can be any positive integers as long as they are less than ai. So the number of possible subsets is the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} union {ai}, but since ai is the maximum, we need to include ai, and the rest can be any subset of the numbers less than ai.

Wait, no, B is a finite nonempty set. So for each ai, the number of sets B where ai is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} that can be combined with ai. But each B must be non-empty. However, since ai is included, the subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} can be empty. So for each ai, the number of such B is 2^{ai - 1}.

Wait, because for each element less than
