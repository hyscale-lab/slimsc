Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The first graph is given by the equation y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and the second is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Both functions involve compositions of f and g, which are defined as f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 | and g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I should probably understand what the functions f and g look like. Let's start by analyzing f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at (0,0). Then, we subtract 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. That would shift the graph down by 1/2, but since it's an absolute value, the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). However, because we're taking the absolute value again, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, this will reflect any negative parts back up. 

Let me think about the critical points where |x| - 1/2 is zero. That happens at |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So, f(x) will have a V-shape at these points. For x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. That's another V-shape, peaking at (0, 1/2) and hitting zero at x = ±1/2. For |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape starting from x = ±1/2, increasing as |x| increases.

So, f(x) is a piecewise function that goes from 0 at x = ±1/2, up to 1/2 at x = 0, and then linearly increases again beyond |x| = 1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this one. The inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, so |x| - 1/4. The critical points are at |x| = 1/4, so x = ±1/4. For |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. For |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. So, g(x) has a peak at x = 0 with value 1/4, and slopes downward to zero at x = ±1/4, then slopes upward beyond that.

Now, the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) involve compositions of these functions. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first function: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

Let me first see the innermost function: sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1, because the standard period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so here 2π/(2π) = 1. So, sin(2πx) is a sine wave that repeats every 1 unit along the x-axis. Its range is between -1 and 1.

So sin(2πx) will output values between -1 and 1. Then, f(sin(2πx)) is || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Let's compute this.

Let me denote u = sin(2πx). So f(u) = | |u| - 1/2 |. Let's compute f(u):

If |u| >= 1/2, then f(u) = |u| - 1/2; if |u| < 1/2, then f(u) = 1/2 - |u|.

So, for u in [-1, -1/2], |u| is 1 to 1/2, so f(u) = |u| - 1/2. Similarly for u in [1/2,1], |u| is 1/2 to 1, f(u) = |u| -1/2.

For u in (-1/2, 1/2), f(u) = 1/2 - |u|.

So f(u) is a function that for |u| >= 1/2, it's linear with slope ±1, decreasing from 1/2 to 0 as |u| increases from 1/2 to 1. Wait, no: when u increases from 1/2 to 1, |u| increases, so f(u) = |u| -1/2 increases from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, let me correct that. For u in [1/2,1], f(u) = |u| -1/2, so as u goes from 1/2 to 1, f(u) goes from 0 to 1/2. Similarly, for u in [-1, -1/2], f(u) goes from 0 to 1/2 as u goes from -1/2 to -1. For u in (-1/2, 1/2), f(u) is 1/2 - |u|, which is a V-shape peaking at u=0 with f(u)=1/2, and goes down to 0 at u=±1/2.

So f(u) is a function that goes up to 1/2 at u=0, then slopes down to 0 at u=±1/2, and then continues up again beyond u=±1/2 to 1/2 at u=±1. Wait, no. Wait, at u=1, f(u) is |1| - 1/2 = 1/2. Similarly, at u=-1, f(u) is 1/2. So f(u) is a function that looks like a diamond shape, peaking at u=0 and u=±1, with minima at u=±1/2.

Wait, let me think again. For u between -1 and -1/2, f(u) = |u| -1/2. That would be, for u=-1, |u|=1, so f(u)=1-1/2=1/2. For u=-1/2, |u|=1/2, f(u)=0. So from u=-1 to u=-1/2, f(u) goes from 1/2 down to 0. Similarly, from u=-1/2 to 0, f(u) = 1/2 - |u|, so it increases back up to 1/2 at u=0. From u=0 to 1/2, it decreases again to 0 at u=1/2, and from u=1/2 to 1, it increases back to 1/2.

So f(u) is a V-shaped function with minima at u=±1/2 and peaks at u=0 and u=±1.

So f(u) is symmetric about the y-axis for u in [-1,1], since u is sin(2πx), which is symmetric.

Then, after computing f(u), we apply g to it. So g(f(u)) = ||f(u)| - 1/4|.

Since f(u) is always non-negative (because it's an absolute value), |f(u)| is just f(u). So g(f(u)) = |f(u) - 1/4|.

So now, g(f(u)) is another absolute value function. Let me think about the values of f(u).

f(u) ranges from 0 to 1/2, as we saw. So f(u) is in [0, 1/2]. So when we compute |f(u) - 1/4|, let's see where f(u) is relative to 1/4.

When f(u) >=1/4, then |f(u) -1/4| = f(u) -1/4.

When f(u) <1/4, |f(u) -1/4| = 1/4 -f(u).

So g(f(u)) is a piecewise function:

- For f(u) in [0,1/4), g(f(u)) = 1/4 - f(u)
- For f(u) in [1/4, 1/2], g(f(u)) = f(u) - 1/4.

So, in terms of u, we can write this as:

g(f(u)) = |f(u) - 1/4|.

So, the function inside the 4 multiplier is g(f(u)), which is in [0, 1/4], since f(u) is in [0, 1/2].

Wait, let me think: since f(u) can be up to 1/2, so:

- When f(u) is 0, g(f(u)) is 1/4.
- When f(u) is 1/4, g(f(u)) is 0.
- When f(u) is 1/2, g(f(u)) is 1/4.

So g(f(u)) is a V-shaped function that goes from 1/4 at f(u)=0, down to 0 at f(u)=1/4, then back up to 1/4 at f(u)=1/2.

So, after we compute g(f(u)), we multiply by 4. So 4g(f(u)) would scale this function up.

Let me plot this in my mind. So when g(f(u)) is 0, 4g(f(u)) is 0. When g(f(u)) is 1/4, 4g(f(u)) is 1.

So, the function 4g(f(u)) ranges from 0 to 1.

So, putting it all together, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that oscillates because sin(2πx) is periodic, but the composition with f and g will create a more complex oscillation.

Similarly, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is another equation involving the same functions but with cos(3πy) inside. Since cos(3πy) has a different frequency, 3π, which means its period is 2/3. So, cos(3πy) completes a full cycle every 2/3 units in y.

But since the equation is x = ... , it's a function where x is determined by y, so it's a relation that can be plotted as a curve in the xy-plane.

Our task is to find the number of points (x,y) where both equations are satisfied. That is, points where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

This seems pretty involved. Maybe I can approach this by first analyzing the possible ranges of x and y, and then looking for intersections.

But perhaps it's better to consider the periodicity and symmetry of the functions.

First, let's note that sin(2πx) has a period of 1, and cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3 in y. So the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are both periodic, but with different periods.

But since we're looking for intersections, which can occur anywhere, perhaps we should consider the fundamental periods and how they interact.

Alternatively, maybe we can parameterize the problem.

Wait, another thought: since both functions involve compositions of absolute values, they are both even functions in some way. Let me check.

Looking at f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, which is even because f(-x) = f(x). Similarly, g(x) is even. So, both f and g are even functions, and hence any composition of them will also be even.

So, sin(2πx) is an odd function, but when you take its absolute value inside f, which is even, the absolute value makes it even. So, f(sin(2πx)) is even in x, because f(|sin(2πx)|) = f(|sin(-2πx)|) = f(|sin(2πx)|). So, the entire function f(sin(2πx)) is even in x.

Similarly, g(f(sin(2πx))) is even in x.

So, 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is an even function in x, so y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is symmetric about the y-axis.

Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), since cos(3πy) is even in y (cos(-θ)=cosθ), so cos(3π(-y))=cos(3πy), so the entire expression is even in y. Therefore, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is symmetric about the x-axis.

Therefore, the graphs of both equations are symmetric. So, any intersection point (a,b) implies that (-a,b), (a,-b), and (-a,-b) are also intersection points, unless a or b is zero.

But this might complicate things, so perhaps it's better to consider the first quadrant and then multiply by the number of symmetric points.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of solutions in a specific region and then account for symmetry.

But before that, maybe I can understand the possible ranges of x and y.

Let me think about the possible values of y and x.

Given that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), and since f(sin(2πx)) ranges between 0 and 1/2 (as we saw earlier), then g(f(u)) = |f(u) - 1/4|.

So, the argument to g is between 0 and 1/2. So, when f(u) is in [0,1/4), g(f(u)) = 1/4 - f(u), which ranges from 1/4 down to 0. When f(u) is in [1/4, 1/2], g(f(u)) = f(u) - 1/4, which ranges from 0 up to 1/4.

So, the maximum value of g(f(u)) is 1/4, and the minimum is 0. Therefore, 4g(f(u)) ranges from 0 up to 1. So, y ranges between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), since cos(3πy) is between -1 and 1, same as sin(2πx), so the same reasoning applies: 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is between 0 and 1. So, x ranges between 0 and 1.

So, both x and y are in [0,1]. Therefore, we can limit our search to the square [0,1] x [0,1].

But wait, is that the case? Because sin(2πx) is periodic over all real x, but when we compute f(sin(2πx)), which is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|, the f(sin(2πx)) is periodic with the same period as sin(2πx), which is 1. So, the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is periodic with period 1 in x.

Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3 in y, so x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is periodic with period 2/3 in y.

Therefore, the behavior of the functions repeats every 1 unit in x and every 2/3 units in y.

But since we're looking for intersections in all real numbers, it's enough to analyze the behavior in one period of x and in one period of y, and then multiply by the number of periods.

But perhaps that's more complicated. Maybe it's better to consider that each function has a certain periodicity and then find how many solutions exist within a fundamental region.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider substituting variables to make it easier.

Let me define u = 2πx and v = 3πy. Then, sin(u) and cos(v) are the arguments inside the functions.

But perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the equations as parametric equations.

For the first equation, y is expressed in terms of x. For the second equation, x is expressed in terms of y. So, to find intersections, we can set y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), and solve for x and y.

But that's a system of equations that's nonlinear and likely can't be solved algebraically. So, perhaps we can graph both functions and count the number of intersections, but since this is a thought process, I'll have to visualize it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of solutions by analyzing the number of times the two curves cross each other within a certain domain.

But given that both x and y are in [0,1], as we saw, perhaps I can consider the square [0,1]x[0,1] and count the number of intersections there, then account for symmetry.

But let
