Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob has a winning strategy, meaning no matter how Alice plays, Bob can force a win.

Hmm, this sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these often involve determining winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the next player can force a win.

So, let me break it down. Let's consider small values of n and see who wins. Maybe a pattern will emerge.

n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So Bob cannot win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no, wait. If Alice takes 1, Bob is left with 1 token and must take it, so Bob wins. Wait, hold on. Wait, the last token taken wins. So in n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Alice loses. Wait, but is there another option? Wait, Alice can also take 4, but n=2, so she can't. So Alice has to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. So Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, no, in n=2, Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Bob can win here. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player (Alice), so Bob can win.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me think again. If it's Alice's turn with n=2, she can take 1, leaving n=1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't win when n=2. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.

Wait, but in n=1, Alice takes 1 and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for the first player. n=2,
