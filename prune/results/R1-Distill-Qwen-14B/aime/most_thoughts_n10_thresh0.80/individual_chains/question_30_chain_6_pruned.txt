Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some special properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0 to 12 gives all the distinct roots. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that directly helps here yet.

The product I'm supposed to calculate is a product over all these roots, so maybe I can find a way to express this product in terms of polynomials evaluated at certain points. Let me write out the term in the product: (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for each k.

Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let me rearrange the terms:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Let me denote x = ω^k, so the expression becomes x² - 2x + 2. So each term is a quadratic evaluated at x = ω^k.

So the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Since ω is a primitive 13th root, as k varies from 0 to 12, ω^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity.

Wait, but if I have a product over all x = ω^k of (x² - 2x + 2), that would be the same as evaluating the polynomial P(x) = x² - 2x + 2 at all the roots of Φ₁₃(x), right? Because each ω^k is a root of Φ₁₃(x), except when k=0, since ω^0 = 1, which is a root of Φ₁₃(x) as well, but wait, no—Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots, so ω^0 = 1 is not a root of Φ₁₃(x). So actually, when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so we have to evaluate P(1) as a separate term.

Wait, let me clarify. The product is from k=0 to 12, so when k=0, we have P(1) = 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So that term is just 1. Then for k=1 to 12, each ω^k is a primitive 13th root of unity, so they are roots of Φ₁₃(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

Therefore, the entire product is the product of P(x) evaluated at x=1 and all the roots of Φ₁₃(x). But since P(1) is 1, the total product is the product over all roots x of Φ₁₃(x) of P(x).

I remember that for a polynomial Q(x) of degree n with roots r1, r2, ..., rn, the product over all (x - ri) is Q(x). But in this case, I need the product over (a*ri² + b*ri + c), which isn't directly the same as evaluating a polynomial at each root. Hmm, but perhaps I can relate it to the value of another polynomial.

Wait, the product over all roots x of Φ₁₃(x) of (x² - 2x + 2) is equal to the resultant of Φ₁₃(x) and P(x), but I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the product as evaluating the polynomial P(x) at each root of Φ₁₃(x) and then multiplying them together.

Alternatively, I recall that the product over all roots α of f(x) of (x - α) is f(x). But here, I have a product over (α² - 2α + 2) for each root α of Φ₁₃(x). How can I relate this to Φ₁₃(x)?

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as evaluating another polynomial at each root. Let me see: if I have a polynomial Q(x) = x² - 2x + 2, then the product over all Q(ω^k) for k=1 to 12 is the product of Q(ω^k) where ω^k are the roots of Φ₁₃(x). So the product is equal to the product of Q(ω^k) for each root ω^k of Φ₁₃(x). 

Now, how can I compute that? I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product of f(α) over all roots α of another polynomial g(x) is equal to the resultant of f and g, but I'm not too familiar with how to compute that, especially for cyclotomic polynomials.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the product over all roots α of Φ₁₃(x) of (α² - 2α + 2) is equal to the resultant of Φ₁₃(x) and Q(x) = x² - 2x + 2. The resultant can be computed as the product of Q(α) for each root α of Φ₁₃(x). But how do I compute the resultant?

Wait, another approach: if I have two polynomials f(x) and g(x), the product of g(α) over all roots α of f(x) is equal to the resultant of f and g, which is also equal to the product of (root of g - root of f). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial for ω, any symmetric function of its roots can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of Φ₁₃(x). But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, let's think about this differently. Let me define y = x - 1, so Q(x) = x² - 2x + 2 = (x - 1)^2 + 1 = y² + 1. So Q(x) = y² + 1, where y = x - 1.

So the product over all roots α of Φ₁₃(x) of Q(α) = product_{α} ( (α - 1)^2 + 1 ). Hmm, that might be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the product over α of Q(α) is equal to the product over α of (α² - 2α + 2). Let me write this as product_{α} (α² - 2α + 2).

Hmm, now, if I can relate this to another polynomial whose roots are α² - 2α + 2, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider another substitution. Let me set β = α - 1, then α = β + 1. Then Q(α) becomes (β + 1)^2 - 2(β + 1) + 2 = β² + 2β + 1 - 2β - 2 + 2 = β² + (2β - 2β) + (1 - 2 + 2) = β² + 1. So Q(α) = β² + 1, where β = α - 1.

So the product becomes product_{α} (β² + 1) = product_{α} ( (α - 1)^2 + 1 ). So now, if I can find the product over all α of ( (α - 1)^2 + 1 ), that might be easier.

But how? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product over all α of (x - α) is Φ₁₃(x). So if I can find a polynomial whose roots are (α - 1)^2 + 1, then maybe the product I'm looking for would be related to that.

Wait, but that might be too vague. Maybe another approach: think of the product over all α of (α² - 2α + 2) as the product over all α of ( (α - 1)^2 + 1 ). So that's equal to product_{α} ( (α - 1)^2 + 1 ). Let me consider that as a product over (β^2 + 1), where β = α - 1.

So if I can find a polynomial whose roots are β = α - 1, then maybe I can compute the product over (β^2 + 1). But what's the relationship between the polynomial for α and β?

Since α are the roots of Φ₁₃(x), which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1 = 0. Let me denote f(x) = Φ₁₃(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1.

If β = α - 1, then α = β + 1. Substitute into f(x):

f(β + 1) = (β + 1)^12 + (β + 1)^11 + ... + (β + 1) + 1 = 0.

So the roots β satisfy f(β + 1) = 0. Therefore, the polynomial with roots β is f(β + 1). Let's denote this as g(β) = f(β + 1).

Then, the product over all β of (β^2 + 1) is equal to product_{β} (β^2 + 1) = product_{β} (β - i)(β + i), where i is the imaginary unit.

Which is equal to g(i) * g(-i), because g(x) is the polynomial with roots β, so g(i) = product_{β} (i - β), and similarly g(-i) = product_{β} (-i - β). Therefore, product_{β} (β^2 + 1) = product_{β} (β - i)(β + i) = g(i) * g(-i).

Therefore, the product we're looking for is g(i) * g(-i).

So, our original product (from k=1 to 12) is equal to g(i) * g(-i). But wait, earlier I said that the product from k=0 to 12 is P(1) * product from k=1 to 12 Q(ω^k). Since P(1)=1, the total product is just g(i)*g(-i). Wait, no, hold on. The product from k=0 to
