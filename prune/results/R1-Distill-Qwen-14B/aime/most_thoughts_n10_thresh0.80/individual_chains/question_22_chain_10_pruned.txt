Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the sides are equal, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular because it's only equilateral, not necessarily equiangular. But since opposite sides are parallel, it must have some symmetry.

I remember that in such hexagons, the sides can be thought of as vectors, and since opposite sides are parallel and equal in length (since it's equilateral), the hexagon can be thought of as a translation in the plane. Maybe it's a type of parallelogon? Wait, in two dimensions, a parallelogon is a polygon with opposite sides equal and parallel, like a parallelogram but for polygons with more sides.

Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, this hexagon is a special case. I think in such hexagons, the sides can be grouped into three pairs of opposite sides. Each pair is in the same direction, maybe separated by some angles.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend the sides AB, CD, EF, they form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, this is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it.

I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Let's denote the side length as 's'. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is length 's'.

I should probably draw a diagram or at least imagine it. Let me think about the hexagon as sitting inside this larger triangle. Each side of the hexagon is parallel to the opposite side, so perhaps each extension of AB, CD, EF meets to form the triangle.

Wait, in such a hexagon, does each pair of opposite sides contribute to one side of the triangle? So, the triangle's sides are formed by extending these opposite sides.

I think this relates to similar triangles or perhaps using the concept of intercept the sides.

Wait, I remember that in such cases, the
