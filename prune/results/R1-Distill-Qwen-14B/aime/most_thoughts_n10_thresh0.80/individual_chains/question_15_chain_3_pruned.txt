Okay, so I've got this math problem here about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First off, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So any path is a combination of these right (R) and up (U) moves. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But this problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So that's a different constraint.

Wait, okay, changing direction exactly four times. That means the path alternates between moving right and up, and the number of times it switches from one direction to another is four. So, how does that translate into the number of segments in the path?

Let me think. If a path changes direction four times, how many straight segments does it have? Each time you change direction, you start a new segment. So if you start with, say, a right move, then change to up, that's one change. Then change again to right, that's two, and so on. So if you change direction four times, you end up with five segments. Because the number of segments is one more than the number of direction changes.

So each path is made up of five segments, alternating between right and up moves. Now, since the grid is 8x8, the total right moves must add up to 8, and the total up moves must add up to 8 as well.

Let me think about how the segments are arranged. The path starts either going right or up, but since we're moving from the lower left to the upper right, the first move is probably right, but maybe not necessarily. Wait, but in the problem statement, it just says from lower left to upper right, so the direction could vary. Hmm, but the grid is square, so starting with right or up should be symmetric. I'll have to consider both possibilities, I think.

But wait, actually, if the problem is about changing direction exactly four times, regardless of starting direction, I need to account for both possibilities. So maybe the total number is twice the number of paths starting with right and having four direction changes. Or is it?

Wait, no, not necessarily. Because the number of direction changes might not be symmetric if you start with right or up. Let me see. Suppose we start with right, then up, then right, then up, etc. Similarly, starting with up, then right, etc. So depending on whether the number of direction changes is even or odd, the starting direction might affect the number of segments. Hmm, but in this case, four direction changes would result in five segments, regardless of starting direction.

But wait, let's think of the number of segments. Starting with right, the number of segments would be right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, upâ€” wait, no. Wait, four
