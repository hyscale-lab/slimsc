Alright, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this.

First, let me visualize the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral, all its sides are equal in length, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not be equal. Also, all opposite sides are parallel. That probably gives it some sort of symmetry, maybe like a regular hexagon but stretched or compressed in certain directions.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. So, if I extend those sides, they meet to form a triangle. Let me think about how these extensions work.

In a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, when you extend each of the sides AB, CD, and EF, they should meet at some points, forming a larger triangle outside the hexagon. Similarly, the other sides BC, DE, and FA might form another triangle. But the problem mentions only one triangle with those side lengths, so maybe those are the outer triangle.

Wait, but in a regular hexagon, the extensions of every other side meet at points forming another regular hexagon. But this hexagon is equilateral but not necessarily regular. So maybe the triangle formed is similar to the inner triangle or something? Hmm, not sure.

I remember that in such hexagons, called "affine regular" maybe? Or perhaps they can be thought of as a scaled version of a regular hexagon. But affine transformations can stretch and skew, so maybe the triangle formed by those extensions relates to the original hexagon's side through some scaling factors.

Let me think about the properties of such hexagons. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a transformation of a regular hexagon. So, if I consider a regular hexagon, scaling it differently in different directions would preserve the opposite sides being parallel and the equilateral nature. So, perhaps the triangle formed by the extensions is related to the scaling factors.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry could help. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and see if I can model the problem.

Let me denote the hexagon as ABCDEF in order, with each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Since it's convex and equilateral, each side has length 's', which I need to find.

Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Now, when I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me call this triangle T, with sides opposite to the extended lines of AB, CD, and EF.

Wait, how do these extensions meet? Let's think about how each pair of extensions would meet. For example, extending AB and CD should meet at a point, say P, and similarly, extending CD and EF meet at another point Q, and so on.

But in this case, the problem says the triangle formed by these three extensions has sides 200, 240, and 300. So, perhaps the distances between the intersection points are 200, 240, and 300.

Alternatively, maybe the lengths of the sides of triangle T correspond to the lengths of the extensions beyond the hexagon. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using vectors or similar triangles.

Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a combination of three parallelograms. Because each pair of opposite sides is both equal and parallel, so each pair defines a parallelogram. But since it's a hexagon, maybe it's a combination of three such parallelograms sharing a common vertex or something.

Alternatively, consider that in such a hexagon, the midlines connecting the midpoints of the sides form another triangle, but I'm not sure if that's helpful
