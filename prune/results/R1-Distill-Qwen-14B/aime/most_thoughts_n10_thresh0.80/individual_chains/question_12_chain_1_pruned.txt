Okay, so I've got this problem here about a 2x3 grid where I have to place digits in each cell. The goal is to make sure that when you read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999, and when you read them top to bottom, their sum is 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So, the top row has three cells, and the bottom row also has three cells. Let me denote the top row as A, B, C and the bottom row as D, E, F. So, the grid looks like this:

A | B | C
---------
D | E | F

Now, according to the problem, reading left to right gives two numbers. The top row is a three-digit number ABC, and the bottom row is DEF. Their sum should be 999. So, ABC + DEF = 999.

Additionally, reading top to bottom gives three two-digit numbers: AD, BE, and CF. Their sum should be 99. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, let me make sure I understand correctly. For the top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is AD, the second is BE, and the third is CF. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Okay, so I have two equations:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

And each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit from 0 to 9, right? Well, actually, A and D can't be zero because they are the first digits of numbers. Wait, ABC is a three-digit number, so A can't be zero. Similarly, DEF is a three-digit number, so D can't be zero. But AD is a two-digit number, so A can't be zero, and D can't be zero either. Hmm, so both A and D must be at least 1.

Wait, but in the example given, the top row is 0, 0, 8. But according to that, ABC would be 008, which is 8, a single-digit number. So, maybe the leading zeros are allowed in the left-to-right reading? Or perhaps the problem allows ABC and DEF to be two-digit or one-digit numbers as well? Hmm, the problem statement says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999." So, if the first row is 008, that's 8, and the second row is 991, that's 991. Their sum is 8 + 991 = 999, which works. So, leading zeros are allowed in the left-to-right reading, meaning that ABC can be a one, two, or three-digit number, but for the purposes of summing, it's treated as a number. So, leading zeros don't matter because 008 is 8.

That changes things a bit. So, A can be zero, but then ABC would be a two-digit or one-digit number. Similarly, D can be zero, but then DEF would be a two-digit or one-digit number. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, D is 9, so the bottom row is 991, which is three digits. But if D is zero, then DEF would be 0EF, which is EF, a two-digit number. So, the sum ABC + DEF is 999, which could be any combination as long as the sum is 999. So, ABC and DEF can be numbers with 1, 2, or 3 digits, as long as when you add their numeric values, you get 999.

But in that case, how does that affect the digits? Hmm, perhaps each cell can be any digit, including zero, except that when you read left to right, you can have leading zeros which result in smaller numbers. So, in terms of the grid, each cell is just a single digit, 0-9, no constraints except for the sum conditions.

So, moving on. Let me denote the numbers:

- ABC is a three-digit number, but since leading zeros are allowed, it can be from 000 to 999. Similarly, DEF is from 000 to 999.

But their sum is fixed at 999. So, ABC + DEF = 999.

So, DEF must be equal to 999 - ABC. So, for every possible ABC, DEF is determined as 999 - ABC. But since DEF is a three-digit number with digits D, E, F, we need to ensure that DEF is a three-digit number, which would mean that D must be at least 1. Wait, but if ABC is 000, then DEF would be 999, which is okay. If ABC is 100, DEF is 899, which is okay. If ABC is 999, DEF is 000, but DEF being 000 would mean D is 0, which is allowed as a digit in the grid, but in that case, DEF is 000, which is 0. However, in the top-to-bottom reading, AD is a two-digit number. If D is 0, then AD is 0 followed by A, which
