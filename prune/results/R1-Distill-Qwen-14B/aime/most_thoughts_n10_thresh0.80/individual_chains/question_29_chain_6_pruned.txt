Okay, so I just came across this geometry problem, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they all lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting. 

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE. Hmm, okay. Let me sketch this out on paper to get a better idea.

First, let's note that rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles are right angles. So, rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16, which means all the sides are known. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is the length, and FG is the width.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they must lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line DC, but wait, D and C are already corners of rectangle ABCD. Hmm, so E and F are on the same line as D and C. So, the points are in the order D-E-F-C or maybe another order? Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order must be D, E, C, F or some other permutation. Wait, actually, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order might be D-E-C-F or D-C-E-F? Hmm, not sure yet.

But wait, in rectangle ABCD, sides AB and CD are equal, so CD is also 107. Similarly, BC is 16, so AD is also 16. Rectangle EFGH has EF = 184 and FG = 17, so EH is also 17 and FG is 17, so the sides are 184 and 17.

Wait, also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That might be important.

Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to model the problem. Maybe coordinate geometry can help
