Okay, so I've got this problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. I need to find the length of CE. 

Let me try to visualize this. So, we have two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides BC=16 and AB=107. Rectangle EFGH has sides FG=17 and EF=184. The points D, E, C, F are on the same line. So, if I imagine the points along a line, probably from left to right, D, E, then C, F? Or maybe E, D, C, F? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, ABCD is a rectangle. So in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, which would be one side, and BC is 16, the other side. So AB is the length, BC is the height. So, if I consider point A at the origin (0,0), then B would be at (107, 0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). So, that's rectangle ABCD.

Rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. So, EF is the length, FG is the height. So, if I think of point E somewhere on the line where D, E, C, F lie, then the rectangle EFGH would be attached or connected in some way. Since E, D, C, F are collinear, maybe E is to the left of D and F is to the right of C? Or perhaps E is between D and C? Hmm.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, the four points lie on a circle. I remember that in cyclic quadrilaterals, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees, but I don't know if that will help directly here. Maybe there's another property I can use.

Let me start by trying to assign coordinates to the points. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) to simplify things since it's a corner of the first rectangle. So, if D is (0,0), then A is (0,16), because AD is 16, right? Wait, no. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is (0,0), then C would be (107,0), because DC is equal to AB, which is 107. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's clarify. Let me define the coordinates properly.

Let me take point D at (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is one corner, then C would be at (x, 0), B at (x, y), and A at (0, y). Wait, no. If D is (0,0), then since ABC
