Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when we read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. Also, when we read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. The example they gave is a grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8, and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1. So, reading left to right gives 008 + 991 = 999, and reading top to bottom gives 09 + 99 + 81 = 99. 

Alright, let me break this down. So the grid is 2 rows and 3 columns. Each cell will have a single digit (0-9). The top row forms a three-digit number, and the bottom row forms another three-digit number when read left to right. Their sum is 999. Then, reading each column top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99.

Hmm, so let me denote the grid as follows:

Top row: A B C
Bottom row: D E F

So the numbers are ABC (the top number) and DEF (the bottom number). Their sum is ABC + DEF = 999.

Then, the vertical numbers are AD, BE, and CF. Their sum is AD + BE + CF = 99.

So, I need to find all possible digits A, B, C, D, E, F such that:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Also, each letter represents a single digit (0-9), with the exception that A and D can be zero? Wait, hold on. In the example, the top number starts with 0, so it's 008, which is effectively 8. Similarly, the bottom number starts with 9, so 991. So, leading zeros are allowed in the top and bottom numbers. So, A and D can be zero.

But wait, for vertical numbers, AD is a two-digit number, so AD would be 10*A + D. Similarly, BE is 10*B + E, and CF is 10*C + F.

So, the vertical sum is (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

But that can be rewritten as 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

So, let me write that:

10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99.

Additionally, the sum of ABC and DEF is 999. Let's express ABC and DEF in terms of their digits:

ABC = 100*A + 10*B + C
DEF = 100*D + 10*E + F

So, ABC + DEF = 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

So, 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

So, now we have two equations:

1. 10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99
2. 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

Let me write these down more clearly:

Equation (1): 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

Equation (2): 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

Hmm, perhaps I can find some relationships between these equations. Let me consider the digits in each place.

From Equation (2), the sum of the hundreds digits (A and D) contributes to the hundreds place in 999. Similarly, the tens digits (B and E) contribute to the tens place, and the units digits (C and F) contribute to the units place.

Wait, but 999 is 9*100 + 9*10 + 9*1. So, the sum in the units place (C + F) must end with 9, but since C and F are digits (0-9), their sum could be 9 or 19. But since C and F are
