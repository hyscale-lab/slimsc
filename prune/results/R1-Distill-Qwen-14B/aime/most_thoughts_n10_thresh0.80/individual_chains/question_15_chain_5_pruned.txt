Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's see.

First, I remember that in grid paths, each move is either right or up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, moving from the start (0,0) to the end (8,8) requires moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of rights (R) and ups (U), with exactly 8 of each.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. Changing direction means switching from R to U or U to R. So, if a path has exactly four direction changes, how does that translate to the number of runs of each direction?

Wait, a run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. For example, if you go RRRUUURR, that's three runs of R and two runs of U. So, each direction change corresponds to the start of a new run.

If a path changes direction exactly four times, that means it has five runs in total. Because each direction change adds one more run. For example, if you start with R, then change to U, that's two runs. Each additional change adds another run. So four changes mean five runs.

Now, in the case of an 8x8 grid, each path must start with either R or U. Let's consider both cases.

Case 1: The path starts with R. Then, the runs alternate between R and U. Since there are five runs, starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So three runs of R and two runs of U. But wait, we need to make sure that the total number of R's is 8 and U's is 8.

So, for this case, the three runs of R must add up to 8, and the two runs of U must add up to 8. Each run is at least 1 step because you can't have a run of zero.

Similarly, Case 2: The path starts with U. Then, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U. So three runs of U and two runs of R. Again, the three U runs must total 8, and the two R runs must total 8.

So, regardless of the starting direction, we have either three runs of R and two runs of U, or three runs of U and two runs of R, each with the sum of 8.

Now, the number of such paths can be calculated by considering the number of ways to partition the steps into runs.

Let me think: For a given case, say starting with R and having three R runs and two U runs, the number of ways to arrange the steps is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts for R and 8 into 2 parts for U. Then, the number of sequences is the product of these compositions, multiplied by the number of ways to interleave the runs.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Each run must consist of at least one step. So, for the R runs: 8 steps into 3 runs, each at least 1. The number of ways to do this is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) because it's stars and bars: putting two dividers in the 7 gaps between the 8 steps.

Similarly for the U runs: 8 into 2 runs, so C(7,1) = 7 ways.

But wait, the runs themselves are sequences of consecutive steps. So, the number of ways to split R into 3 runs is C(8-1,3-1) = 21, and for U into 2 runs is C(8-1,2-1) = 7.

So, for each case (starting with R or starting with U), the number of ways is 21 * 7. But wait, not exactly. Because the arrangement of the runs depends on the starting direction.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: once we have the runs determined, the way they are interleaved depends on the starting direction.

But in our case, since the starting direction is fixed (either R or U), the order of runs is determined. So for starting with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So the number of such paths is the number of ways to split R into 3 runs times the number of ways to split U into 2 runs.

Similarly for starting with U.

So, number of paths starting with R: C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 * 7 = 147.

Same for starting with U: C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 * 7 = 147.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but hold on! The problem says "change direction exactly four times." So, does starting with four direction changes correspond to five runs, or is it five direction changes?

Wait, no. Let me think again about direction changes and the number of runs.

If you start with R, then change direction to U, that's one direction change. Then, changing back to R is the second, then U is the third, then R is the fourth. So, four direction changes lead to five runs.

Wait, but in the case where starting with R and having three R runs and two U runs, the number of direction changes is indeed four. Because:

R...U...R...U...R: the changes are R to U, U to R, R to U, U to R. So four changes, yes.

Similarly, starting with U, U...R...U...R...U: four changes.

So, in both cases, starting with R or U, we get four direction changes, resulting in five runs.

So, the total number is 2 * (C(7,2)*C(7,1)) )= 2 * 147 = 294.

But wait, is that the correct way to compute it?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such paths is 2 * [ (number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts) * (number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts) ) ].

Which is 2 * [ C(7,2) * C(7,1) ) ] = 2 * [ 21 * 7 ] = 294.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as the number of ways to arrange the runs.

Wait, another approach: the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is equal to the number of ways to have five runs, starting with either R or U.

So, for each starting direction, the number of runs is either R, U, R, U, R or U, R, U, R, U.

In both cases, the number of runs of R and U are 3 and 2, or 2 and 3, respectively.

So, in the first case, R has three runs and U has two.

The number of ways to split R into three runs is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, the number of ways to split U into two runs is C(8-1,2-1)= C(7,1)=7.

So, for each starting direction, the number is 21*7=147.

Since there are two starting directions, total is 294.

So, does that mean the answer is 294?

Wait, but let me think again. Let me take a smaller grid to check.

Suppose the grid is 2x2, and the path has to change direction exactly two times.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the total steps are 4, with two R and two U.

If the number of direction changes is two, then the number of runs is three.

So, for example, RRUU has one direction change (at the third step), but that's only one change. Wait, no. RRUU would have only one direction change, from R to U.

Wait, if we have two direction changes, then the number of runs is three. Let's see: for example, RURU: that would be R, U, R, U. That's three direction changes.

Wait, no, let me clarify:

Each time the direction changes, it's one change. So, RRUU has one change (from R to U). RURU has three changes (R to U, U to R, R to U). So, in a 2x2 grid, how many paths have exactly two direction changes?

Hmm, let me think.

In a 2x2 grid, the number of paths from (0,0) to (2,2) is C(4,2) = 6.

Let's list them:

1. RRUU: one change
2. RURU: three changes
3. RUUR: two changes
4. URRU: three changes
5. URUR: three changes
6. UURR: one change

Wait, so in this case, only two paths have two direction changes: RUUR and UURR. Each of these has two direction changes.

Wait, let's count the changes:

RUUR:

R -> U at step 2 (change 1), U -> U (no change), U -> R at step 4 (change 2). So, two changes. So, yes, two direction changes.

Similarly, UURR: U -> U, then U -> R at step 3 (change 1), then R -> R. Wait, no, step 4: R -> R? No, wait, step 4 is the end. So, from step 3 to 4, it's R to R, which is no change. So, UURR has only one change, from U to
