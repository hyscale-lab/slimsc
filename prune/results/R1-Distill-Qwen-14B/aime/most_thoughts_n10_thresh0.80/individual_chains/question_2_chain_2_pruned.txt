Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. We need to find a point C on AB, different from A and B, that's not on any other segment from F except AB. Then compute OC², which is p/q, and find p + q.

Hmm, let me visualize this. So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis above (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So, AB is a line segment connecting A and B.

The family F is all these unit-length segments PQ where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p² + q² = 1.

I think these segments are all the possible chords of the unit circle in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a chord from the x-axis to the y-axis, with length 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and it's the only point on AB that isn't on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Because OA is 1/2 and OB is sqrt(3)/2, and the length of AB should be sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) which is sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, AB is a member of F, and point C is on AB such that it's the only point on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F. So, other than AB, no other PQ in F passes through C.

So, I think we need to find the point C on AB where the only PQ from F that contains it is AB itself. So, C is the point where if you try to draw any other PQ from F through C, it's not possible. So, maybe C is where the envelope of all these PQs just touches AB?

Wait, maybe the point C is where the envelope of F touches AB. Because the envelope would be the curve that is tangent to all the PQs in F.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is the only PQ from F that passes through it, so it's the unique intersection point.

Wait, perhaps we can parametrize the segments PQ. Since each PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² =1. So, for any such PQ, the equation of the line can be written as x/p + y/q = 1.

Because the intercept form of a line is x/a + y/b =1, where a and b are intercepts. So, in our case, a=p, b=q, so the equation is x/p + y/q =1.

Since p² + q² =1, so we can write the equation as x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the family of lines as x cos θ + y sin θ =1, where θ is the angle made with the x-axis, and since the length of PQ is 1, which is equal to sqrt(p² + q²), so that's consistent.

Wait, yes, because for a line x cos θ + y sin θ = r, the distance from the origin is r, but in our case, the intercepts are p and q, and p² + q² =1, so r would be 1. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right parametrization. Wait, actually, the distance from the origin to the line x/p + y/q =1 is |0 + 0 -1| / sqrt( (1/p)^2 + (1/q)^2 ). Hmm, I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps parametrizing the lines by p. So, for each p in (0,1), q = sqrt(1 - p²), so the line is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) =1.

So, that's a way to write the family of lines in F.

Now, we are to find a point C on AB such that it's not on any other line from F except AB itself. So, for any other p (i.e., different from the p corresponding to AB), the line x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²)=1 doesn't pass through C.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point on AB that is "closest" to the origin or something? Or maybe it's the point where the envelope of the family F is tangent to AB.

Wait, the envelope is the set of points where each point is on exactly one member of the family F. So, if the envelope touches AB at point C, then C is only on AB and no other PQ from F.

So, I think we need to find where the envelope of the family F intersects AB. That point C will be the unique point on AB not lying on any other F.

So, how do we
