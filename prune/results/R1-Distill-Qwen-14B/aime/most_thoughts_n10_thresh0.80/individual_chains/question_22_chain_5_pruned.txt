Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. An equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length, right? And since all opposite sides are parallel, it must be something like a regular hexagon but maybe not necessarily with all angles equal. Convex means all internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend these three sides, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300. I wonder what that triangle looks like. Maybe a right triangle? Let me check using the Pythagorean theorem. 200² + 240² is 40,000 + 57,600 = 97,600. 300² is 90,000. No, that doesn't add up, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a scaled version of some triangle. The sides are 200, 240, 300. Let's see if they have a common divisor. 200, 240, 300. They all divide by 20: 10, 12, 15. So, maybe it's similar to a 10-12-15 triangle?

I think I remember that in such hexagons, when you extend the sides, the triangle formed relates to the hexagon's side through similar triangles. Maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles here.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal, each side is 's'. Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF has sides 200, 240, 300. So perhaps each side of this triangle is made up of two parts: one part is the side length of the hexagon, and the other is some extension.

Wait, but AB is a side of the hexagon. If I extend AB beyond B, and similarly for CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, these extensions form the sides of the triangle. So each side of the triangle is the sum of the hexagon's side and some extension.

But wait, no. Because when you extend AB, CD, and EF, these extensions meet at points forming the triangle. So each side of the triangle is actually made up of two extensions from the hexagon. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps each side of the triangle corresponds to a certain multiple of the hexagon's side. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the triangle might be similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides but scaled up by a certain factor.

Wait, I think this is related to the concept of similar triangles and affine transformations. Maybe the triangle is an affine image of the hexagon, but I'm not
