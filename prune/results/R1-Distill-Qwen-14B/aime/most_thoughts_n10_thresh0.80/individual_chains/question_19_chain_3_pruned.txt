Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It involves a triangle ABC with some specific properties: the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is given as 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about circumcenters and incenters. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius 13. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's the center of the inscribed circle with radius 6.

The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry for this? Or perhaps there's a property or theorem that relates these centers and the sides of the triangle.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can use the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter to other elements of the triangle. I remember there's a formula: OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if that's correct.

Yes, that's right! Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that OI² = R² - 2Rr. So plugging in R=13 and r=6, we get OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). 

Alright, so the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). But wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IOA is a right triangle with right angle at I. So, in triangle IOA, IO is one leg, IA is the other leg, and OA is the hypotenuse.

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA = 13. IO is sqrt(13), so IA can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let me write that down.

In triangle IOA:
(OA)² = (IO)² + (IA)²
13² = (sqrt(13))² + (IA)²
169 = 13 + (IA)²
IA² = 169 -13 = 156
So IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Wait a second, IA is the length from the inradius center to vertex A. Is there a formula that relates IA to other elements of the triangle?

Yes, I think IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and inradius. Let me recall the formula for the length of the inradius from the incenter to a vertex.

The formula for IA is (r) / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Is that correct? Let me check.

Yes,
