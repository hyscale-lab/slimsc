Okay, so I've just come across this interesting probability problem involving a regular octagon. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step.

The problem says that each vertex of a regular octagon is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. Then, we need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. So, the octagon has 8 vertices. Each can be either red or blue independently. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. So, the denominator of our probability will be 256.

Now, we need to count how many colorings satisfy the condition that there's some rotation (by 0째, 45째, 90째, etc.) such that when we rotate the octagon, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the condition correctly. After rotating, each blue vertex must map to a red vertex. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices after rotation must be a subset of the original red vertices.

Alternatively, the image of the blue set under rotation must be a subset of the red set.

But, since we can rotate the octagon, maybe we're looking for colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Hmm, not exactly. Because the rotation could be by any multiple of 45째, so all possible rotations are considered.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For each coloring, check if there exists a rotation that maps the blue vertices to the red vertices. So, for a given coloring, is there a rotation such that when you apply it, every blue vertex moves to where a red vertex was.

Wait, but the blue set and red set are complementary. So, the image of the blue set under rotation must be exactly the red set. Because if the blue set maps to the red set, then the red set would map to the blue set under the inverse rotation.

Wait a second, that makes sense because if you have a rotation that sends blue to red, then applying the inverse rotation would send red to blue. So, in this problem, the condition is equivalent to the blue set being a rotated copy of the red set. So, the
