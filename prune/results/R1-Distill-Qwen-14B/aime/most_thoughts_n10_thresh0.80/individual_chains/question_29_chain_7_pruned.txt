Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. It involves two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with some points collinear and others lying on a circle. The goal is to find the length of CE. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me note down the given information:

- Rectangles ABCD and EFGH. So, both are rectangles, meaning all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal.
- Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line in that order, I assume.
- Points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference.
- Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184. Need to find CE.

Wait, okay, so ABCD is a rectangle. So, let me sketch this in my mind. Let me label the rectangle ABCD, where AB is one side, BC is another. Since AB = 107 and BC = 16, that gives the sides of the rectangle. So, AB would be 107 units, BC 16 units, making it a tall and long rectangle.

Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. EF = 184, FG = 17. So, EF is the longer side, 184, and FG is the shorter side, 17.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order is D-E-C-F on a straight line. So, between D and F, we have E and C lying on that line.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, that's four points from the two rectangles on a single circle, which must be the circumcircle passing through these four points.

Wait, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, that might imply some cyclic quadrilateral properties. Maybe we can use the cyclic quadrilateral theorem or something related to that.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. ABCD is a rectangle. So, points A, B, C, D arranged in order. EFGH is another rectangle, with E, F, G, H. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E is somewhere on the line between D and C, and F is another point beyond C. Wait, but that might not make sense since C is a corner of the first rectangle. Alternatively, maybe E is between D and C, and F is on the extension beyond C? Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the line D-E-C-F is such that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. Let me consider that.

So, starting from D, moving straight, we have E, then C, then F. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F in that order.

Now, since ABCD is a rectangle, the sides are AB = 107, BC = 16. So, AD must be equal to BC, which is 16, and DC is equal to AB, which is 107.

Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF = 184, FG = 17, which implies EH = FG = 17, and HG = EF = 184.

Wait, but how are these rectangles positioned? Since EFGH is another rectangle, and points D, E, C, F are collinear, perhaps EFGH is placed such that EF is on the same line as DC.

Wait, but in rectangle EFGH, EF is a side, so it's 184 units long, which is quite long, longer than BC of the first rectangle. Hmm.

I think it's best if I assign coordinate systems to the points to make this more concrete.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AD is 16, AB is 107, so point A would
