Okay, so I have this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each resident owns at least one of these four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, or a bag of candy hearts. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." Oh, that's different. So every single person owns a bag of candy hearts. So candy hearts are universal; everyone has them. The other three—diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade—are optional.

So, the numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring,
- 367 own a set of golf clubs,
- 562 own a garden spade,
- 900 own candy hearts (which is everyone).

Additionally, there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things and 234 who own exactly three of them. We need to find how many own all four.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a problem about sets and their intersections. Since every resident owns at least the candy hearts, and possibly other items, we can model this with a Venn diagram involving four circles, but since candy hearts are universal, perhaps that's the biggest set encompassing all others.

Wait, but let me think again. The four things are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But candy hearts are owned by everyone, so actually, the other three are the only variables. So maybe I can model this as three sets (diamond, golf, garden) within a universal set of 900, where everyone has candy hearts, so maybe the fourth set is redundant or already included.

Wait, but the problem is about four items, so perhaps it's four sets. Wait, no, since candy hearts are owned by everyone, maybe that's like a fourth set that includes all the others. So the four sets are A (diamond), B (golf), C (garden), and D (candy hearts). But since D is the universal set, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that D is included in all the other sets. So, the problem is about three optional items, and all of them are subsets of the 900 residents, each of whom has at least D (candy hearts). So, perhaps it's better to model the problem with three sets (A, B, C) within the universal set U of 900. But wait, the question is about four items, but since D is universal, perhaps the other three are the ones with varying ownership.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the three optional items (diamond, golf, garden) along with the mandatory candy hearts. So, each resident has at least D, but may have 0, 1, 2, 3, or all four of the items.

Wait, but the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, candy hearts are the fourth item, and all have it. So, the four items are A (diamond), B (golf), C (garden), and D (candy hearts). Since D is universal, the other three are subsets of D.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the numbers given are for A, B, C, and D is everyone. So, the residents can have any combination of A, B, C along with D. So, the problem is about four sets, but since D is universal, perhaps we can model this as the union of A, B, and C within D.

Wait, perhaps I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets. But since we have four items, but D is universal, maybe it's better to model it as three sets within D, and then account for overlaps.

Wait, but the numbers given are for A, B, C, and D is 900. So
