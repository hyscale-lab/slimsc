Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in a list that meets certain conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me list out the given properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more times than any other number in the list, and no other number shares this mode.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all these items. Hmm, okay.

Let me start by recalling some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track. 

- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. Since it's unique, only 9 is the mode.
- **Median**: The middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of items, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list, which is interesting.
- **Sum**: All the numbers add up to 30.

So, the list is a collection of positive integers where 9 is the only mode, the sum is 30, and the median is an integer not present in the list.

Let me think about the structure of the list. Since 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice, but more than any other number. So, if any other number appears twice, 9 must appear three times, right? Because if another number appears twice, 9 needs to have a higher count to be the unique mode.

Wait, actually, the mode is unique, so no other number can appear as many times as 9. So, if 9 appears k times, every other number can appear at most k-1 times.

But let's think about the smallest possible list. Let me consider possible lengths of the list.

The length could be any number, but since we're dealing with a median, which is a single number, the list must have an odd number of elements. Wait, no, the median can be an integer even if the list has an even number of elements, but in that case, the median is the average of two middle numbers. However, in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of two numbers, which could be a non-integer. But here, the median is a positive integer. So, that implies that the average of the two middle numbers is an integer, meaning those two middle numbers must either both be even or both be odd, so their average is an integer.

But in our problem, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. So, if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is an integer not in the list. Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is an integer. But in that case, since the median is a number in the list, but the problem says it's not present. So, that can't happen. Therefore
