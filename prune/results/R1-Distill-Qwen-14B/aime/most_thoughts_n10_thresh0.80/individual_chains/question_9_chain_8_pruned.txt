Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product of two numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The problem gives me two logarithmic equations:

1. log base x of y^x equals 10.
2. log base y of x^{4y} equals 10.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help. Let me write them down to make it clear.

First, let's recall that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite both equations in exponential form to make it easier.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the logarithm property that log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a), I can rewrite this as:

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, but log_x(y) is another logarithm. Let me denote that as some variable to make it simpler. Let's say:

Let a = log_x(y). Then, the equation becomes x * a = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, using the same logarithm power rule: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Let me denote another variable here: let b = log_y(x). So now the equation becomes 4y * b = 10.

Hmm, okay, so now I have two equations:

1. x * a = 10
2. 4y * b = 10

But I also know that a and b are related because they're logarithms of each other with different bases. Specifically, since a = log_x(y), that means x^a = y. Similarly, since b = log_y(x), that means y^b = x.

Wait, that's interesting. So, from a = log_x(y), we get y = x^a. And from b = log_y(x), we get x = y^b. But since y is x^a, substituting into the second equation gives x = (x^a)^b = x^{a*b}. So, x = x^{a*b}. Since x > 1, this implies that a*b = 1.

So, a * b = 1. That's an important relation.

Now, let's go back to our first two equations:

1. x * a = 10

2. 4y * b = 10

But since a and b are reciprocals (because a*b = 1), we can express b as 1/a.

So, equation 2 becomes 4y * (1/a) = 10.

Let me write down both equations again with this substitution:

Equation 1: x * a = 10 => x = 10 / a.

Equation 2: (4y) / a = 10 => 4y = 10a => y = (10a) / 4 = (5a)/2.

So, now I have expressions for both x and y in terms of a.

But I also know that y = x^a. So, substituting the expressions for x and y in terms of a into this equation.

y = x^a => (5a/2) = (10/a)^a.

Hmm, okay, so (5a/2) = (10/a)^a.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to simplify. Let's take the natural logarithm, for example.

ln(5a/2) = a * ln(10/a).

Let me write that out:

ln(5a/2) = a * [ln(10) - ln(a)].

Expanding the right side:

ln(5a/2) = a ln(10) - a ln(a).

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might be difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe there's a substitution or a clever way to find a.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between x and y to express xy in terms that can be solved.

Wait, I was supposed to find xy. Let me see if I can express xy in terms of a.

From earlier, x = 10/a and y = (5a)/2.

So, xy = (10/a) * (5a/2) = (10 * 5 * a) / (a * 2) )= (50 a) / (2a) = 25.

Wait, is that correct? Let me see:

(10/a) * (5a/2) = (10 * 5 a) / (a * 2) = (50a)/(2a) =
