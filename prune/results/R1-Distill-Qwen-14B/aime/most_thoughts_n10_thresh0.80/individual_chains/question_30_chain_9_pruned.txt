Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's given that ω ≠ 1 and it's a 13th root. So, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all distinct roots. That means the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

The product we're dealing with is over all 13th roots of unity, so maybe there's a way to relate this product to the cyclotomic polynomial or some other polynomial whose roots are these ω^k. Let me write down the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in ω^k, but maybe there's a way to factor it or simplify it.

Wait, let me let z = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z². So, for each k, we're evaluating 2 - 2z + z² where z is a 13th root of unity (excluding z=1 when k=0, but the product includes k=0, so z=1 is included as well). So, the product becomes the product from z=1 to z=ω¹² of (2 - 2z + z²). So, if I can compute the product of (2 - 2z + z²) for all 13th roots of unity z, that would give me the desired value.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the polynomial whose roots are these 13th roots of unity. Since Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1, and the roots are ω, ω², ..., ω¹². So, if I can relate the product to Φ₁₃(x) evaluated at some point, or perhaps to another polynomial.

Wait, another thought: if I have a product over (a - z) for all roots z of Φ₁₃(x), then that product would be Φ₁₃(a). But in this case, the product isn't just (a - z), it's (2 - 2z + z²). So, maybe I can factor this expression or find a polynomial that has these terms as factors.

Let me see: 2 - 2z + z². Let's rearrange that: z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic. The roots of z² - 2z + 2 = 0 can be found using the quadratic formula: z = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i. Therefore, the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

Wait, so if I write the product from z=1 to z=ω¹² of (z² - 2z + 2) as the product over all roots of Φ₁₃(x) of (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). But Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial with roots ω, ω², ..., ω¹². So, the product over all roots z of (z - a)(z - b) would be Φ₁₃(a)Φ₁₃(b)? Hmm, no, that's not quite right. Because the product over (z - a) for all roots z of Φ₁₃(x) is Φ₁₃(a). So, in this case, since each term is (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), the product would be Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i).

Wait, let me test that. If I have a polynomial P(x) = (x - a₁)(x - a₂)...(x - a_n), then the product over (c - a_k) for each root a_k is P(c). So, in this case, each term in the product is (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), which is equal to (z - c)(z - d) where c = 1 + i and d = 1 - i. So, the product over all z (where z are the roots of Φ₁₃(x)) of (z - c)(z - d) is equal to Φ₁₃(c) * Φ₁₃(d). So, yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is equal to Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i). So, now I need to compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i), then multiply them together, and then find the remainder when that product is divided by 1000.

So, first, let's recall that Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Alternatively, Φ₁₃(x) can be written as (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1). So, maybe computing Φ₁₃(1 + i) is easier if I use that formula.

Let me compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/(1 + i - 1) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/(i). Similarly, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(1 - i - 1) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i).

So, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first. I remember that (1 + i) can be represented in polar form. Let me compute that.

The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2), and its argument is π/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Let me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, for the angles: 13π/4. Let's reduce this angle modulo 2π. 13π/4 divided by 2π is (13/4)/(2) = 13/8, which is 1 and 5/8, so subtracting 2π once gives 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So, e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i * 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, e^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{-i * 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.

So, let's compute (1 + i)^13:

(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ) ]

Let me compute that step by step. Multiply 64*sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2):

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) / 2 = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)i = same as above, so it's -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13:

(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ) ]

Again, compute the real part first: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.

Imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)i = 64*(2/2)i = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.

Now, let's compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / i

= [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] / i

= ( -65 - 64i ) / i

To divide by i, multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

= ( (-65 - 64i) * (-i) ) / (i * -i )

= (65i + 64i² ) / 1

Since i² = -1, this becomes 65i - 64.

So, Φ₁₃(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.

Similarly, compute Φ₁₃(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / (-i)

= [ (-64 + 64i ) - 1 ] / (-i )

= ( -65 + 64i ) / (-i )

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

= ( (-65 + 64i ) * i ) / ( (-i ) * i )

= ( -65i + 64i² ) / (-i² )

= ( -65i - 64 ) / 1

Because i² = -1, so denominator becomes -(-1) = 1.

So, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = -64 - 65i.

Wait, let me double-check that:

Wait, the denominator was (-i)*i = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So, the numerator is (-65 +64i)*i = (-65i +64i²) = (-65i -64). So, yes, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.

So, now, our product is Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i) = (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i).

This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.

So, | -64 +65i |² = (-64)^2 + (65)^2.

Compute that:

(-64)^2 = 4096

65^2 = 4225

So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 64^2: 64*64 is 4096, correct.

65^2: 65*65 is 4225.

So, 4096 + 4225: 4096 + 4000 = 8096, 8096 + 225 = 8321.

So, the product is 8321.

Wait, but wait, (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) is equal to (-64)^2 - (65i)^2, right?

Wait, no, actually, it's (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², but here a is -64 and b is 65i. So,

(-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (65^2 * i²) = 4096 - (4225 * (-1)) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Yes, same result.

So, the product is 8321.

Wait a second, but let me confirm: is the product Φ₁₃(1+i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i) equal to 8321? Because that's what I'm getting. So, the original product is 8321.

But wait, the original product includes k=0 as well. Let me make sure that the way I set it up included z=1. Let me check:

When k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 -2 +1 =1. So, yes, when z=1, we have 1, which is included in the product. But in the cyclotomic polynomial, Φ₁₃(x) doesn't include x=1 as a root, but in my product, I'm including z=1 as well. Wait, no, because Φ₁₃(x) is the product over (x - ω^k) for k=1 to 12, since ω^0=1 is excluded. So, when I considered the product over z=1 to z=ω¹², that included z=1, which is not a root of Φ₁₃(x). Therefore, my initial approach might have an error.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again.

Earlier, I considered the product over all 13th roots of unity (including z=1) as the product over (z² -2z +2). So, that would be the product over all z where z^13=1 of (z² -2z +2). But since Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots, with roots z=ω, ω², ..., ω¹², which are the primitive roots. So, if I factor (z² -2z +2) as (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)), then the product over all primitive 13th roots would be Φ₁₃(1 +i) * Φ₁₃(1 -i). But wait, does that include z=1?

No, because Φ₁₃(x) is the product over primitive roots, so when I take the product over all primitive roots, I'm not including z=1.

But in our original problem, the product includes k=0, which corresponds to z=1. So, in the original product, we have (2 - 2*1 +1^2) =1, as I computed earlier, and then the product over k=1 to 12 is the product over primitive roots. So, the total product is 1 * Φ₁₃(1 +i) * Φ₁₃(1 -i) ) = 1 * 8321 = 8321.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I thought the product over all roots (including z=1) would be Φ₁₃(1 +i) * Φ₁₃(1 -i). But actually, when I considered Φ₁₃(x) as the product over primitive roots, then the product over all roots of unity (including z=1) would be different.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in including z=1. Let me clarify:

The product we're looking for is from k=0 to 12, which includes all 13th roots of unity. So, the product is over all z where z^13 =1 of (2 - 2z + z²). So, if I factor each term as (z² -2z +2), then the product is the product over all z^13=1 of (z² -2z +2).

But the polynomial (x² -2x +2) can be factored as (x - (1+i))(x - (1 -i)). So, the product over all roots z of (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)) is equal to the value of the polynomial whose roots are all 13th roots of unity evaluated at x=1+i and x=1 -i.

Wait, but the product over all z
