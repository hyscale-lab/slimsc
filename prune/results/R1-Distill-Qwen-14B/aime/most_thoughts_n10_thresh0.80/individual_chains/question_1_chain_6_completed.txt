Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me write that as equation (xy).

Now, from equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Simplify exponents: 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) because 1/3 is 4/12. So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's call this equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy): x y = 2^(-2/3). But y = x * 2^(-1/12), so substituting:

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which is x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Solve for x^2:

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12). Taking square roots:

x = 2^(-7/24), since sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Again, positive root.

So x is 2^(-7/24). Equation (x).

Now, from equation (y): y = x * 2^(-1/12). So plugging in x:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y is 2^(-3/8). Equation (y).

So now, we have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2.

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me write them as exponents with denominator 24 for ease:

x: -7/24

y: -3/8 = -9/24

z: -5/12 = -10/24

So:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-10/24)

Now, the question is to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute the exponent first.

x⁴ y³ z²:

= (2^(-7/24))^4 * (2^(-9/24))^3 * (2^(-10/24))^2

Compute each term:

(2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)

(2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-9/24 *3) = 2^(-9/8)

(2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-10/24 *2) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply all together:

2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)

Let me compute the exponents:

First, convert all to 24 denominators:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them:

-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

So exponent is -75/24, which simplifies to -25/8.

So x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)

Therefore, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

Since we take absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8

So the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.

Therefore, m is 25, n is 8. So m + n = 33.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the exponents:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-10/24)

Calculating x⁴: (-7/24)*4 = -7/6

y³: (-9/24)*3 = -9/8

z²: (-10/24)*2 = -10/12 = -5/6

Adding exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Convert to 24 denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Correct.

So log₂ is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8, so m/n is 25/8, m + n = 33.

Looks good. So the answer is 33.


Given the system of logarithmic equations involving positive real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4},
\]

we convert each equation to its exponential form:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\) implies \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\).
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\) implies \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\) implies \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

By substituting these expressions into each other, we solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of powers of 2:

- \(z = 2^{-5/12}\),
- \(y = 2^{-3/8}\),
- \(x = 2^{-7/24}\).

Next, we compute \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (2^{-7/24})^4 \cdot (2^{-3/8})^3 \cdot (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6}.
\]

Adding the exponents:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}.
\]

Thus, \(x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-25/8}\), and taking the logarithm base 2:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8}.
\]

The absolute value is \(\left|-\frac{25}{8}\right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Since 25 and 8 are coprime, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
