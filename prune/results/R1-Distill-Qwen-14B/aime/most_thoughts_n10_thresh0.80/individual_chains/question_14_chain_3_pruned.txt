Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The condition is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient Q and the remainder R.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. Also, it's the greatest such number with the given property. So I probably need to find the largest four-digit number where changing any single digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7.

Let me think about how changing a digit affects divisibility by 7. Divisibility by 7 isn't as straightforward as some other numbers, but maybe I can use modular arithmetic here.

Let’s denote N as a four-digit number: N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are digits, with a not zero. So, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

The problem states that if any one digit is changed to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, changing that digit to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

Let me consider each digit one by one:

1. Changing the thousands digit (a) to 1: The new number would be 1bcd. So, 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing the hundreds digit (b) to 1: The new number is a1cd. So, 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing the tens digit (c) to 1: The new number is ab1d. So, 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing the units digit (d) to 1: The new number is abc1. So, 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these cases, the resulting number should be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let me write these conditions as congruences:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, maybe I can compute the coefficients modulo 7 first to simplify.

Let me compute each coefficient modulo 7:

1000 mod 7: Let's see, 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7: 10-7=3. So 10≡3 mod7.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, rewriting the congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡0 mod7

So these are four congruences that the digits a, b, c, d must satisfy.

Let me note that we want N to be as large as possible, which is 9999, but we have to adjust it to satisfy all these conditions.

So N should be as close to 9999 as possible, but with these four conditions.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can represent the four equations and see if I can solve for a, b, c, d.

Let me write down the four equations:

Equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7 → 2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7).

Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod7 → 6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7 (since -2 ≡5 mod7).

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod7 → 6a + 2b + d ≡4 mod7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7).

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod7 →6a + 2b + 3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 ≡6 mod7).

Hmm, now we have four equations:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7
2. 6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7
3. 6a + 2b + d ≡4 mod7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡6 mod7

Hmm, maybe I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

First, let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation1:

(6a +3c +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡5 -1 mod7

So, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Which is 6a -2b =4 mod7.

We can write this as 3a - b ≡ 2 mod7. Because 6a is 6a, which is 6a ≡6a mod7, but wait let's see:

Wait, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

We can factor out 2: 2*(3a - b) ≡4 mod7.

Since 2 and 7 are coprime, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7.

The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, multiply both sides by 4:

(2*(3a -b)) *4 ≡4*4 mod7 → (3a -b) ≡16 mod7 →16 mod7 is 2, because 7*2=14, 16-14=2. So,

3a -b ≡2 mod7.

So, equation A: 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, let's look at equation 3 and equation 4.

Equation 4: 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Equation 3: 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Let me subtract equation 3 from equation4:

(6a +2b +3c) - (6a +2b +d) ≡6 -4 mod7.

So, 3c - d ≡2 mod7.

So equation B: 3c - d ≡2 mod7.

Now, let's look at equation1 and equation2.

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation B is 3c -d ≡2 mod7. Let me solve equation B for d:

3c -d ≡2 → -d ≡2 -3c → d ≡3c -2 mod7.

Now, substitute d into equation1:

2b +3c + (3c -2) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

2b +3c +3c -2 ≡1 → 2b +6c -2 ≡1 →2b +6c ≡3 mod7.

Factor 2: 2(b +3c) ≡3 mod7.

Again, 2 inverse is 4. Multiply both sides by 4:

(2(b+3c)) *4 ≡3*4 mod7 → (b +3c) ≡12 mod7 →12 mod7 is 5.

So, equation C: b +3c ≡5 mod7.

Now, let's collect the equations we have:

Equation A: 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Equation C: b +3c ≡5 mod7.

Equation B: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, now, perhaps solve for variables step by step.

Let me think about the digits a, b, c, d. Each is between 0 and 9, except a which is between 1 and 9.

Since we want N to be as large as possible, a should be as large as possible, then b, c, d.

So ideally, a=9, b=9, c=9, d=9, but they have to satisfy the conditions.

But let's see.

Given that a is as large as possible, let's try a=9.

From equation A: 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Plugging a=9:

3*9=27 →27 mod7. 7*3=21, 27-21=6. So 27≡6 mod7.

So, equation A: 6 -b ≡2 mod7 → -b ≡2 -6 → -b ≡-4 mod7 → b ≡4 mod7.

Since b is a digit, 0≤b≤9. So possible values for b are 4 and 11, but 11 is not a digit, so b=4.

So if a=9, then b=4 mod7. So b=4, 11, 18,... but since b is a digit, b=4.

So, b=4.

Now, from equation C: b +3c ≡5 mod7.

We have b=4:

4 +3c ≡5 mod7 →3c ≡1 mod7.

What's 3c ≡1 mod7?

We can write c ≡ (1/3) mod7. The inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, c ≡5*1 ≡5 mod7.

So c can be 5 or 5+7=12, but since c is a digit (0-9), c=5 or 12, but 12 is invalid, so c=5.

So c=5.

Then, from equation B: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

c=5, so 3*5=15 →15-2=13 →13 mod7 is 6 (since 7*1=7, 13-7=6).

So d≡6 mod7.

Since d is a digit (0-9), possible d=6 or 13, but 13 is invalid. So d=6.

So, with a=9, we get b=4, c=5, d=6.

So N would be 9456.

Wait, but is that the maximum? Maybe I can get a higher number.

Wait, 9456 is less than 9999, but maybe there's a way to have a=9, b=9, but that would require b=9, but in our case, when a=9, from equation A, b=4. So perhaps we can't get a higher b.

But let's verify whether N=9456 satisfies the original conditions.

Let me test each condition:

1. Change a to 1: 1456. Check if divisible by 7.

1456 ÷7: 7*208=1456. So yes, divisible.

2. Change b to 1: 9156. Check divisibility by 7.

9156 ÷7: 7*1308=9156. So yes.

3. Change c to 1: 9416. Check divisibility by 7.

9416 ÷7: Let's compute 7*1345=9415. So 9416-9415=1→ remainder 1. So not divisible by 7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, so N=9456 doesn't satisfy condition 3. So our approach might be wrong.

Hmm, so perhaps something went wrong in our reasoning.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

We had:

Equation C: b +3c ≡5 mod7.

We set a=9, so b=4.

Then, 4 +3c ≡5 mod7 →3c≡1 mod7 →c=5.

Then, d=3c-2 mod7→3*5-2=13≡6 mod7→d=6.

But then, when changing c to 1, the number 9416 is 9416. Divided by 7: 9416 /7.

Compute 7*1345=9415, so 9416-9415=1. So remainder 1. Not divisible by 7. So our N=9456 doesn't satisfy condition 3. So this can't be the correct N.

Hmm, so perhaps our assumption that a=9 is too hasty, or maybe the values of b, c, d are not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is not unique, so we have to find the maximum N where all four conditions are satisfied.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me double-check.

Wait, when we substituted into equation1, let me recheck that.

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

After substituting d=3c-2, equation1 becomes 2b +3c +3c -2 ≡1 mod7 →2b +6c -2≡1 mod7.

Which simplifies to 2b +6c ≡3 mod7.

Factor out 2: 2(b +3c)≡3 mod7.

Multiplying both sides by 4: b+3c≡12 mod7→12 mod7=5, so b+3c≡5 mod7.

Which is equation C.

So that seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that when a=9, the resulting number doesn't satisfy one of the conditions. So maybe a=9 is not possible, and we need to try a=8.

Wait, but if a=9 gives N=9456, which fails condition3, perhaps I can adjust c and d so that condition3 is satisfied. But given the modular constraints, maybe it's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem requires that changing each digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7, which might require that the original number satisfies some other conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the original number N and how it's related to the numbers obtained by changing each digit to 1.

Let me consider that N is such that when any digit is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

So, for each digit position, N with that digit replaced by 1 is divisible by 7.

So, let me denote the four possible modified numbers as:

N1: 1bcd → 1000 + 100b +10c +d

N2: a1cd →1000a +100 +10c +d

N3: ab1d →1000a
