Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We need to find the length of AP, given that AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Hmm, okay.

First, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Then, tangents at B and C meet at D. Tangent from a point to a circle are equal, so DB=DC? Wait, no. Wait, D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so DB is tangent at B, and DC is tangent at C. So, by the property of tangents from a common external point, DB=DC. So, D is equidistant from B and C. That makes sense.

So, D lies on the external angle bisector of angle BAC? Or perhaps on the symmedian? Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I can use power of a point. Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = (DB)^2.

Wait, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² because DB is the tangent from D to ω. Similarly, DC² is the same. Since D lies outside ω, the power is positive.

Now, AD intersects ω again at P. So, AP is the length from A to P, which is inside ω. So, AP is part of the secant line from A through P. So, perhaps I can use the power of point A with respect to ω. Wait, but A is on ω, so its power is zero. Hmm, that might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe I can use something like Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem. Or perhaps harmonic division?

Wait, maybe I can use inversion. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using similar triangles.

Wait, let me think about the properties of tangents and poles. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then D is the pole of BC with respect to ω. So, the line BC is the polar of D. Then, line AD intersects ω at A and P, so perhaps by La Hire's theorem, if D lies on the polar of P, then P lies on the polar of D. But I'm not sure how to apply this immediately.

Alternatively, maybe using power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D is DB² = DC². Then, since AD is a secant that passes through P, we have DP * DA = DB².

So, let's denote AP = x. Then, since AD intersects ω at A and P, the lengths along AD would be AP = x and PD = AD - AP. Wait, but I need to express AD in terms of
