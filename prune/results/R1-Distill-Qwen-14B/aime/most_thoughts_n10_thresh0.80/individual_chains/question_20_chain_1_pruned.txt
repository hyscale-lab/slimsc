Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Hmm, the problem says there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. I need to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. Also, all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Plus, any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous conditions. 

So, what does this mean? Well, for any row, all the chips in that row must be either all white or all black. Similarly, for any column, all the chips must be the same color. But wait, does that mean that all rows and all columns have to be the same color, or can rows and columns be different? 

Let me think. Suppose I have a row that's all white. Then, each column that intersects this row must either be all white as well or all black. Because if a column has a white chip in this row, but there's a black chip elsewhere in that column, that would violate the condition. So, each column can't have both colors. 

Wait, but then the colors of the rows and columns have to be consistent in some way. Maybe each cell's color is determined by the color of its row and the color of its column. But hold on, if a cell is in a white row and a black column, what happens? That cell would have to be both white and black, which isn't possible. So, that suggests that for a cell, the row and column it's in must have the same color. 

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. If all the chips in a row are white, then every chip in that row is white. Similarly, all chips in a column must be the same color. So, if a column has a white chip (say, in a row that's all white), then the entire column must be white. But if a different row is all black and intersects that column, then the column cannot be black either, because it already has a white chip. So, this suggests that once a column has a white chip, the entire column must be white. Similarly for black.

Wait, this might mean that all the rows and columns must be of
