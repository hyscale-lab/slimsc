Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try breaking it down.

First, I know that \( z \) is a complex number on the circle with radius 4. So \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might be helpful later.

Let me write the expression again to see it clearly:

\[ (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \]

Since \( z \) has magnitude 4, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). So, \( \frac{1}{z} \) is related to the conjugate of \( z \). Maybe I can express everything in terms of \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \), but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So I can rewrite the expression using Euler's formula.

Let me try substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression.

First term: \( (75 + 117i) z = (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \)
Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \)

So the entire expression becomes:

\[ 4(75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \]

Hmm, okay. Let me compute the coefficients first.

Compute \( 4(75 + 117i) \):
4 * 75 = 300
4 * 117 = 468
So that term is 300 + 468i.

So the expression is:

\[ (300 + 468i) e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \]

Now, I can write each exponential in terms of cosine and sine.

Recall that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So let's expand both terms.

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me compute each multiplication separately.

First term:
Multiply (300 + 468i) with (cosθ + i sinθ).

Using distributive property:
300 * cosθ + 300 * i sinθ + 468i * cosθ + 468i * i sinθ

Simplify each term:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468 i² sinθ

Remember that \( i² = -1 \), so:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i

So first term is [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + i [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ]

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Again, use distributive property:

24 cosθ -24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ -36i * i sinθ

Simplify each term:

24 cosθ -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ -36 i² sinθ

Again, \( i² = -1 \):

24 cosθ -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary parts: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i

So the second term is [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ] + i [ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ ]

Now, add both terms together.

Real parts:
300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 -24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So the entire expression is:

[324 cosθ - 432 sinθ] + i [276 sinθ + 504 cosθ]

But the problem asks for the largest possible real part. So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay, so this is a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value of a function like A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). But wait, in this case, it's A cosθ + B sinθ, but here, the coefficients are 324 and -432. So actually, it's 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So the maximum value is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.

Compute 324 squared:
324 * 324. Let me see, 300² = 90,000, 24²=576, and cross terms 2*300*24=14,400. So (300 +24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 976? Wait, 90,000+14,400=104,400; 104,400 + 576=104,976.

324²=104,976.

432 squared: 400²=160,000, 32²=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624.

So sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Well, 540²=291,600 because 500²=250,000, 40²=1,600, 500*40*2=40,000, so 250,000 +40,000 + 1,600=291,600. So sqrt(291,600)=540.

So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure. The expression is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which is equal to R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324² +432²). So yes, the maximum value is R.

Wait, but I just computed R as 540, so the maximum real part is 540.

But let me verify the computations again.

324 squared: 324 * 324.

Let me compute 324 * 300 = 97,200.

324 *24=7,776.

So 97,200 +7,776=104,976. Correct.

432 squared: 432 *400=172,800. 432*32=13,824. So 172,800 +13,824=186,624. Correct.

104,976 +186,624= 291,600. sqrt(291,600)=540. Correct.

So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but just to make sure, is there any step where I might have made a mistake in expanding?

Let me check the initial expansion.

First, (75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z.

z=4e^{iθ}. So (75 +117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96 +144i)/(4e^{iθ}).

That's 300 +468i multiplied by e^{iθ} plus 24 +36i multiplied by e^{-iθ}.

Then, we expanded each term, which gave us real and imaginary parts, and combined the real parts as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, let's double-check the coefficients after expanding the real parts.

First term's real part: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ.

Second term's real part: 24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

So adding them: 300 +24=324, and (-468 +36)= -432 sinθ. Correct.

So the real part is indeed 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So maximum is sqrt(324² +432²)=540.

So the answer should be 540.

But wait, I just realized: is the real part the expression I computed, or is there
