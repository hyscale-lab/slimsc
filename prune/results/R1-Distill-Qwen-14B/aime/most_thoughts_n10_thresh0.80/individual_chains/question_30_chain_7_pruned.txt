Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the 13th roots of unity satisfy the equation x^13 = 1. So, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the distinct roots. Since ω ≠ 1, we're considering the primitive roots here.

The expression I need to compute is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify each term or find a pattern.

Let me denote each term as f(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to a polynomial.

Wait, if I factor 2 out of the first two terms: f(k) = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe express ω^{2k} as (ω^k)^2. Then f(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2. That looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me write it as f(k) = (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2.

So f(k) = (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. Maybe I can factor this quadratic. Let me see the discriminant: D = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So f(k) = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Interesting, so each term factors into two terms involving ω^k and complex numbers.

Wait, but since I'm dealing with roots of unity, maybe I can relate this product to a polynomial evaluated at certain points.

If I consider the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - a), that's the same as the product of (x - a) evaluated at x = ω^k, which for all roots of x^13 - 1 = 0. So that would be x^13 - 1 divided by (x - 1), since we're excluding k=0? Wait, no, because when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so (1 - a).

Wait, maybe I can consider the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1), since it's the product of (a - ω^k) over all roots ω^k, which is a^13 - 1. But wait, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1.

But in my case, I have product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = - (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1). Because the product from k=0 to 12 is (a^13 -1)/(a -1) when a ≠ 1.

Wait, hold on. Let me think. The product over all roots (x - ω^k) is x^13 - 1. So if I set x = a, then product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1. So product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = - (a^13 - 1).

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1). So that's a useful identity.

But in my problem, each term is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). So the product becomes product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)) = [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] × [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k -
