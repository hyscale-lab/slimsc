Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving a, b, c. The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it or relate it to the first equation.

First, I should probably write down both equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I need to find all triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both. Since they are nonnegative integers, maybe I can find some symmetries or factorizations that can help.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that it's symmetric in a, b, c. Each term is a product of two variables, where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to factor it.

Let's see: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So, the entire expression can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Now, since a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c. Let me substitute those into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Expanding each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm. So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if I can relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the first equation, which is a + b + c = 300.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, perhaps I can find a² + b² + c² in terms of ab + bc + ac.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ac, and Q = abc. These are the elementary symmetric sums. Then, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P.

So, a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2P = 90000 - 2P.

Similarly, what about a³ + b³ + c³? I think there's a formula for that too. Yes, a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3Q.

Plugging in the values:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q.

Calculating 300³: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.

Now, going back to the second equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expressions I have:

300*(90000 - 2P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90000 - 2P):

300*90000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2P) = -600P.

So, 300*(90000 - 2P) = 27,000,000 - 600P.

Next, subtract (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q):

So, the entire left-hand side becomes:

(27,000,000 - 600P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q).

Distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q.

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) -3Q.

Which is:

0 + 300P - 3Q.

So, 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - Q = 2,000,000, which implies that Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, we have Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Now, since Q = abc, which is a product of nonnegative integers, Q must be a nonnegative integer. So, 100P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0.

Thus, 100P ≥ 2,000,000 => P ≥ 20,000.

So, P must be at least 20,000.

But what is the maximum possible value of P?

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, the maximum of P occurs when two variables are as large as possible. Let me think, for a fixed sum, the product ab + bc + ac is maximized when the variables are as equal as possible, but for nonnegative integers, if two variables are as large as possible and the third is as small as possible, perhaps?

Wait, actually, the maximum P is when a, b, c are as equal as possible. Because for given a + b + c, ab + bc + ac is maximized when variables are equal due to the symmetry.

So, if a, b, c are each around 100, then P would be maximized.

But let's not get bogged down here. Let's think about what we have so far.

We have:

1. S = a + b + c = 300
2. P = ab + bc + ac
3. Q = abc = 100P - 2,000,000

So, our variables are subject to these three equations.

But how can we find the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy these? It seems that we need to find integer solutions for a, b, c such that their sum is 300, their pairwise products sum to P, and their triple product is Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps we can model this as a cubic equation. The monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0. So, substituting S, P, Q, it becomes:

x³ - 300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, let's group terms:

x³ - 300x² + (P)x - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor P:

x³ - 300x² + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps we can write it as:

x³ - 300x² + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let me think differently.

We have Q = 100P - 2,000,000, so abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Let me rearrange that equation:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ac = -2,000,000.

Factor the left side:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor as:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ac + 100^2(a + b + c) = -2,000,000 + 100^2 * 300.

Wait, that's a bit of a stretch, but perhaps we can complete the expression.

Wait, let me see: Let's factor the left-hand side. Maybe factor by grouping.

Looking at abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ac.

Factor terms:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b).

But since a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c.

So, substitute that in:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000.

So, ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can relate ab to something.

Wait, since a + b + c = 300, and we have ab, perhaps we can express ab in terms of variables.

Let me denote t = a + b = 300 - c.

We know that ab is equal to ( (a + b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2) ) / 2. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, since a + b = t, then ab can be expressed in terms of t and c.

Wait, if a + b = t, then ab can be any value such that ab ≤ (t²)/4, by AM-GM.

But perhaps more importantly, for fixed t, ab can be any integer between 0 and t²/4, but since a and b are integers, it's bounded.

But I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Maybe let's consider that equation:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000.

Let me rearrange it:

ab(c - 100) = 100c(300 - c) - 2,000,000.

So,

ab = [100c(300 - c) - 2,000,000] / (c - 100).

Let me compute the numerator:

100c(300 - c) = 30,000c - 100c².

So numerator = 30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000.

Thus,

ab = [30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000] / (c - 100).

Let me factor the numerator:

Factor numerator: 30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000.

Let me factor out a -100:

-100(c² - 300c + 20,000).

So,

ab = [ -100(c² - 300c + 20,000) ] / (c - 100).

Let me factor the quadratic in the numerator:

c² - 300c + 20,000.

Looking for two numbers that add up to -300 and multiply to 20,000.

Hmm, 20,000. Let me see: 20,000 ÷ 100 is 200. So, 100 and 200: 100 + 200 = 300, but with negative signs.

Wait, so c² - 300c + 20,000 = (c - 100)(c - 200).

Let me check: (c - 100)(c - 200) = c² - 300c + 20,000. Yes, correct.

So, numerator becomes:

-100(c - 100)(c - 200).

Thus,

ab = [ -100(c - 100)(c - 200) ] / (c - 100).

We can cancel (c - 100) in numerator and denominator, provided that c ≠ 100.

So,

ab = -100(c - 200).

So, ab = -100c + 20,000.

Wait, but ab must be a nonnegative integer since a and b are nonnegative integers.

So, ab = -100c + 20,000 ≥ 0.

So, -100c + 20,000 ≥ 0 => 100c ≤ 20,000 => c ≤ 200.

So, c can be at most 200.

Moreover, c must be a nonnegative integer such that (a, b, c) are nonnegative integers with a + b + c = 300. So, c can range from 0 to 300, but in this case, c ≤ 200.

So, c ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., 200}.

But wait, when we canceled (c - 100), we assumed c ≠ 100. What if c = 100? Then, the original expression for ab would have a denominator of zero, so we need to handle that case separately.

Case 1: c ≠ 100.

Then, ab = -100c + 20,000.

And since a + b = 300 - c, let's denote t = a + b = 300 - c.

So, ab = 20,000 - 100c.

Also, a and b are nonnegative integers with a + b = t.

So, given t, ab can take values from 0 up to floor(t² / 4). But in this case, ab is determined as 20,000 - 100c.

So, for each c (from 0 to 200, c ≠ 100), we can compute t = 300 - c, and ab = 20,000 - 100c.

Then, the number of pairs (a, b) is equal to the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b = t and ab = k, where k = 20,000 - 100c.

But wait, for given t and k, the number of solutions is either zero, one, or two, depending on whether the quadratic equation x² - tx + k = 0 has integer roots.

So, for each c, we can compute t and k, then find the number of integer solutions (a, b).

But let me see if there's another way. Let's consider that when c is between 0 and 200, and c ≠ 100.

So, let's move on to Case 2: c = 100.

If c = 100, then let's go back to the equation we had earlier:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000.

But c = 100, so (c - 100) = 0.

Thus, the equation becomes:

ab*0 - 100*100*(300 - 100) = -2,000,000.

So,

0 - 100*100*200 = -2,000,000.

Compute 100*100*200 = 2,000,000.

So,

-2,000,000 = -2,000,000.

Which is an identity. So, when c = 100, the equation is satisfied regardless of a and b, as long as a + b = 200.

But wait, let's check the second equation.

Wait, when c = 100, then a + b = 200, and the second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Plugging c = 100:

a²b + a²*100 + b²a + b²*100 + 100²a + 100²b = 6,000,000.

Simplify term by term:

a²b + 100a² + b²a + 100b² + 10,000a + 10,000b = 6,000,000.

Factor where possible:

a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*200.

Similarly, 100a² + 100b² = 100(a² + b²).

10,000a + 10,000b = 10,000(a + b) = 10,000*200 = 2,000,000.

So, putting it all together:

ab*200 + 100(a² + b²) + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Subtract 2,000,000:

200ab + 100(a² + b²) = 4,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

2ab + a² + b² = 40,000.

Hmm, can we write this as a² + 2ab + b² = 40,000 + something? Wait, a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)^2.

But in our case, it's a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)^2 = (200)^2 = 40,000.

Wait, wait, our equation is a² + 2ab + b² = 40,000.

But since a + b = 200, (a + b)^2 = 40,000. So, the left side is exactly equal to 40,000.

So, 40,000 = 40,000. Which is true.

So, when c = 100, any pair (a, b) such that a + b = 200 will satisfy the second equation.

Therefore, all triples where c = 100 and a + b = 200 are valid. The number of such triples is equal to the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b) with a + b = 200. Which is 201 (since a can be 0 to 200).

So, in the case when c = 100, we have 201 solutions.

Now, going back to Case 1: c ≠ 100.

In this case, for each c from 0 to 200, except 100, we have t = 300 - c, and ab = 20,000 - 100c.

We need to find the number of pairs (a, b) such that a + b = t and ab = k = 20,000 - 100c.

So, for each c, we can find t and k, then solve for a and b.

The number of solutions is the number of integer pairs (a, b) with a + b = t and ab = k.

This is equivalent to solving the quadratic equation x² - tx + k = 0.

The discriminant of this quadratic is D = t² - 4k.

If D is a perfect square, then there are two solutions (since a and b are nonnegative integers, the roots must be integers and nonnegative). If D is zero, there's one solution (a = b = t/2, which requires t even). Otherwise, no solutions.

So, for each c (0 ≤ c ≤ 200, c ≠ 100), compute t = 300 - c, k = 20,000 - 100c.

Compute D = t² - 4k.

If D is a perfect square, count the number of solutions (which is 2 if the roots are distinct, 1 if repeated, else 0). But since a and b are nonnegative integers, we have to ensure that both roots are nonnegative.

Also, D must be nonnegative, so t² - 4k ≥ 0.

So, let's try to formalize this.

For each c in 0,1,2,...,200, c ≠ 100:

1. Compute t = 300 - c.
2. Compute k = 20,000 - 100c.
3. Compute D = t² - 4k.
4. If D < 0: no solutions for this c.
5. Else, check if D is a perfect square.
6. If D is a perfect square, then compute the roots x = [t ± sqrt(D)] / 2.
7. Check if both roots are integers and nonnegative.
8. The number of solutions is 2 if the roots are distinct integers, 1 if they are the same, else 0.

But since we're dealing with a lot of c's, perhaps we can find a pattern or a way to characterize when D is a perfect square.

Let me compute D:

D = t² - 4k = (300 - c)^2 - 4*(20,000 - 100c).

Compute this:

(300 - c)^2 = 90,000 - 600c + c².

4*(20,000 - 100c) = 80,000 - 400c.

So,

D = (90,000 - 600c + c²) - (80,000 - 400c)
= 90,000 - 600c + c² - 80,000 + 400c
= (90,000 - 80,000) + (-600c + 400c) + c²
= 10,000 - 200c + c².

So, D = c² - 200c + 10,000.

Hmm, so D = c² - 200c + 10,000.

We can write this as D = (c - 100)^2 + (10,000 - 100²) = (c - 100)^2 - 100² + 10,000.

Wait, 100² is 10,000, so 10,000 - 10,000 = 0. So,

D = (c - 100)^2.

Wait, that's interesting.

Because c² - 200c + 10,000 = (c - 100)^2.

Yes, because (c - 100)^2 = c² - 200c + 10,000.

So, D = (c - 100)^2.

So, the discriminant is a perfect square for all c. Thus, D is always a perfect square, since it's (c - 100)^2.

Therefore, for every c (including c=100, but in that case, we had to handle it separately), the equation x² - tx + k = 0 will have integer roots.

But when c ≠ 100, D is positive (since c ≠ 100 would make (c - 100)^2 positive), so the roots are distinct.

Wait, but wait: when c=100, D=0, so the quadratic has a repeated root. So in that case, we have a single solution where a = b = t/2.

But in our earlier case, when c=100, a + b = 200, and ab = 20,000 - 100*100 = 20,000 - 10,000 = 10,000.

So, ab = 10,000, and a + b = 200. So, the quadratic equation is x² - 200x + 10,000 = 0.

Which factors as (x - 100)^2 = 0. So, a = b = 100.

But in that case, the number of solutions is 1, but earlier I thought when c=100, any a + b = 200 would work. Wait, but that's conflicting.

Wait, earlier when c=100, I concluded that any a + b = 200 would satisfy the second equation, but according to this quadratic analysis, ab = 10,000 is required. So, that suggests that when c=100, a and b must satisfy a + b = 200 and ab = 10,000.

But wait, I thought earlier when c=100, the second equation is automatically satisfied for any a, b with a + b = 200, but that's not correct. I must have made a mistake there.

Wait, going back to when c=100, the second equation simplified to 2ab + a² + b² = 40,000.

But since a + b = 200, (a + b)^2 = 40,000, so a² + 2ab + b² = 40,000.

But our equation was a² + 2ab + b² = 40,000, which is the same as (a + b)^2 = 40,000, which is always true. So, that suggests that when c=100, any a, b with a + b = 200 will satisfy the second equation.

Wait, but according to the quadratic equation, ab must be 10,
