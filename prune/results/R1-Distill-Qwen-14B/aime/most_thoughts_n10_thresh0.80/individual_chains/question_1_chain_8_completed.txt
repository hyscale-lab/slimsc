Okay, let's try to solve this system of logarithmic equations. So, we have three equations:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²), which will be a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b, so maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Let me write each equation in terms of logs.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:

log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:

log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, okay, so now we have three equations with three variables: log₂(x), log₂(y), log₂(z). Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let me let:

a = log₂(x),
b = log₂(y),
c = log₂(z).

So now the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

So now we have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let me try to add and subtract these equations to eliminate variables.

Maybe adding equation 1 and equation 2. Let's see:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Adding them:
( a - a ) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Simplifies to:
0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6
So, -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/(6*2) = -5/12.

Wait, c is negative? But z is a positive real number, so log₂(z) could be negative if z is between 0 and 1. Okay, that's fine.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's try adding another pair. Maybe equation 1 and equation 3.

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Adding them:
(a - a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 + 1/4
Which becomes:
0 - 2b + 0 = 3/4
So, -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/(4*2) = -3/8.

Hmm, b is also negative. So log₂(y) is negative, meaning y is less than 1.

Now, we have b = -3/8 and c = -5/12.

Now, let's find a. Let's use equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Substituting b and c:

a - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2

Simplify:

a + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2

Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. 8 and 12 have a common denominator of 24.

So, 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24.

Adding them: 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24.

So, a + 19/24 = 1/2.

1/2 is 12/24.

So, a = 12/24 - 19/24 = (12 - 19)/24 = -7/24.

So, a = -7/24.

So now, we have:

a = log₂(x) = -7/24 => x = 2^(-7/24)
b = log₂(y) = -3/8 => y = 2^(-3/8)
c = log₂(z) = -5/12 => z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, we need to compute |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

First, compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂(x) + 3 log₂(y) + 2 log₂(z) = 4a + 3b + 2c.

Substituting the values:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6
3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8
2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Adding them all together:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, find a common denominator for 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each term:

-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24

Adding: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8.

So, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8.

Taking absolute value, we get 25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms because 25 and 8 are coprime.

Thus, m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.


To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each logarithmic equation in terms of logarithms of individual variables. Let \( a = \log_2(x) \), \( b = \log_2(y) \), and \( c = \log_2(z) \). This transforms the system into:

1. \( a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} \)
2. \( -a + b - c = \frac{1}{3} \)
3. \( -a - b + c = \frac{1}{4} \)

By adding and subtracting these equations, we solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

- Adding equations 1 and 2: \( -2c = \frac{5}{6} \) gives \( c = -\frac{5}{12} \).
- Adding equations 1 and 3: \( -2b = \frac{3}{4} \) gives \( b = -\frac{3}{8} \).
- Substituting \( b \) and \( c \) into equation 1: \( a = -\frac{7}{24} \).

Now, we compute \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \) which simplifies to \( 4a + 3b + 2c \):

\[
4a = 4 \left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) = -\frac{7}{6}, \quad 3b = 3 \left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) = -\frac{9}{8}, \quad 2c = 2 \left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{5}{6}
\]

Adding these:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \( \frac{25}{8} \). Thus, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), giving \( m + n = 33 \).

\boxed{33}
