Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle, which is centered at O. The inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle, centered at I. Now, IA is perpendicular to OIâ€”that seems important. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here, placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.

Wait, but before jumping into coordinates, perhaps I can think about some known formulas or theorems that relate the inradius, circumradius, and other elements of the triangle. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:
\[ OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \]
where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me plug in the given values. R is 13, and r is 6.

Calculating that:
\[ OI^2 = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13 \]
So, OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, okay.

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me visualize this. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle IOA is a right triangle at A. Wait, no, actually, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is a segment from O to I. So, the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. That means the angle between them is 90 degrees.

So, maybe I can use some vector analysis here. Let me consider vectors. Let's set up a coordinate system where point I is at the origin. So, I is (0, 0). Then, the vector OI would be the vector from I to O, which in this coordinate system is just the position vector of O, let's say O is at point (h, k). Similarly, the vector IA would be the vector from I to A, which is the position vector of A, say (x, y).

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero. So,
\[ (x, y) \cdot (h, k) = 0 \]
Which gives:
\[ xh + yk = 0 \]
Hmm, but I don't know the coordinates of O or A yet. Maybe I can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry by placing the triangle in such a way that O is at the origin. Wait, O is the circumcenter, so maybe that's a better idea. Let me try that.

Let me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0, 0). Then, the incenter I
