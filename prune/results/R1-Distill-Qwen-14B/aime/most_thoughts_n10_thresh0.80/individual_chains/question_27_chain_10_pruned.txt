Okay, so I have this math problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let's try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, it's a pretty big torus.

The sphere they're talking about has a radius of 11. Now, when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, they are internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's on the outside, they're externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. And the question is asking for the difference r_i - r_o, which will be a fraction m/n, and then we need to find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I'll need to figure out the positions where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both cases and then find the radii of those tangent circles.

First, let's recall some properties of a torus. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this problem, R is 6 and r is 3. 

So, the torus is defined by R = 6, r = 3. The sphere has a radius of 11, so its equation would be x² + y² + z² = 11² if centered at the origin. But the torus's position relative to the sphere matters. When it's resting inside, it's tangent internally, and when it's outside, it's tangent externally.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus touches the sphere from the inside. The point of tangency will be along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

I think it's helpful to model this in 3D coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system such that the axis of the torus is along the z-axis. So, when we revolve the circle around the z-axis, we get the torus. The sphere, in this case, will be centered somewhere, but I'm not sure exactly where yet.

Wait, actually, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the sphere's center is at a certain position relative to the torus. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, the sphere's center is another position relative to the torus.

Wait, no. Maybe the sphere is fixed, and the torus moves relative to it? Hmm, the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's tangent along a circle. So perhaps the sphere is fixed, and the torus is placed inside it, touching along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus is placed outside the sphere, touching along another circle.

Wait, but a torus is a surface of revolution. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, their surfaces touch along a circle. Similarly when it's outside. So, perhaps the sphere is fixed, and the torus is either inside or outside, just touching the sphere at a single circle.

I need to find the radius of that circle in each case, then compute the difference.

Let me think about the internal tangent first. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. So, how are these related?

I think when the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the sphere is at some distance from the center of the torus. Wait,
