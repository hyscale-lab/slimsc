Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (each cell can be from 0 to 9) such that two conditions are satisfied. First, when I read the grid left to right on each row, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Second, when I read the grid top to bottom on each column, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. The example given is a 2x3 grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8, and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1. That works because 008 + 991 equals 999, and 9 + 9 + 81 equals 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid. It has two rows and three columns. Let me denote the cells as follows:

a b c  
d e f  

So, the top row is a, b, c, which forms the number abc. Similarly, the bottom row is d, e, f, forming def. The sum of abc and def is 999.

Similarly, for the columns, each column is read top to bottom, so the first column is ad, the second is be, and the third is cf. Their sum should be 99. So, ad + be + cf = 99.

Wait, but each column is a two-digit number? Because there are two rows. So, for example, the first column is a and d, forming the number ad, which is 10*a + d. Similarly for the others.

So, summarizing:

1. The sum of the two numbers formed by the rows: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

2. The sum of the three numbers formed by the columns: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

My goal is to find all possible assignments of digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9) that satisfy both equations.

Let me write down these equations more clearly.

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

I can try to manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

First, let me subtract Equation 2 multiplied by 10 from Equation 1 to see if that helps. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1.

Wait, Equation 1 is a sum of two three-digit numbers, while Equation 2 is a sum of three two-digit numbers. Let's see:

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Let me subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99.

Calculating the left side:

100a -10a = 90a

10b - 10b = 0

c - 10c = -9c

100d - d = 99d

10e - e =9e

f - f =0

So, left side becomes: 90a -9c +99d +9e = 900.

Simplify by dividing both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me write this as:

10a - c +11d + e = 100.  [Equation 3]

Now, I have Equation 2 which is:

10a + d +10b + e +10c + f =99. [Equation 2]

I can also consider Equation 1:

100a +10b + c +100d +10e +f = 999. [Equation 1]

Maybe I can express some variables in terms of others. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps express Equation 1 in terms of Equation 2.

Equation 1: 100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f = 999.

Which can be written as (10a + d)*10 + (10b + e)*10 + (c + f) = 999.

Wait, no, because 100a +100d = 100*(a + d), but 10a + d is a two-digit number. So, perhaps not directly.

Wait, actually, 100a + 10b + c is the first number, and 100d +10e +f is the second.

So, Equation 1: (100a +10b +c) + (100d +10e +f) = 999.

But Equation 2 is (10a +d) + (10b +e) + (10c +f) =99.

Let me denote:

Letâ€™s say X = 10a +d,

Y =10b +e,

Z=10c +f.

Then Equation 2 becomes X + Y + Z =99.

Now, Equation 1 is (100a +10b +c) + (100d +10e +f) = 999.

Let me express this in terms of X, Y, Z:

100a +10b +c = 10*(10a) +10b +c = 10*(X - d) +10b +c.

Similarly, 100d +10e +f = 10*10d +10e +f = 10*(X - a) +10e +f.

Wait, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps express each component:

100a +10b +c = 10*(10a + b) + c = 10*(something) + c.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me try to express each term:

We have:

X =10a +d

Y=10b +e

Z=10c +f

So, Equation 2: X + Y + Z =99.

Equation 1: (100a +1
