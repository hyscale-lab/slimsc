Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it again and understanding what it's asking.

The problem says: Let B be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, we have to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Alright, so the key points here are that we have rectangular boxes (so they have length, width, and height, which I'll denote as x, y, z). Each of these boxes has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We're supposed to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box, meaning that the sphere's diameter must be at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius of the sphere will be half of that space diagonal.

To recap, for a rectangular box with dimensions x, y, z:

- The surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54.
- The volume is xyz = 23.
- The space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), so the radius r of the sphere is half of that: r = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. Therefore, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So our goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing (x² + y² + z²). Because if we can find the minimum possible value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume, then we can find the smallest possible sphere that can contain such a box.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum of x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, this seems like a constrained optimization problem. I remember that in calculus, we can use Lagrange multipliers to find extrema under constraints. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use inequalities like AM ≥ GM or other algebraic methods.

Let me try to set up the problem using Lagrange multipliers since I think that's the straightforward method here.

We need to minimize the function f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0,

h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

Wait, but usually Lagrange multipliers are used for one constraint. If there are two constraints, maybe I can use a method involving two Lagrange multipliers or perhaps reduce the problem somehow.

Alternatively, maybe I can express variables in terms of each other using the two constraints and substitute into the function to minimize. Let me see.

Let me denote S = x + y + z,

P = xy + yz + zx,

and Q = xyz.

Given that 2P = 54, so P = 27.

And Q = 23.

We know that for a cubic equation with roots x, y, z, the equation would be t³ - S t² + P t - Q = 0, which becomes t³ - S t² + 27 t - 23 = 0.

But not sure if that directly helps. Maybe we can relate x² + y² + z² to S and P.

I remember that x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + zx) = S² - 2P.

Since P is 27, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54.

So, our objective is to minimize S² - 54.

Therefore, minimizing x² + y² + z² is equivalent to minimizing S².

So, the problem now is to find the minimum of S², given that x, y, z are positive real numbers (since they represent dimensions of a box) with P = 27 and Q = 23.

Hmm, so how can we relate S and P and Q?

Alternatively, maybe I can try to express S in terms of the variables and use some inequality.

Wait, but perhaps using the AM ≥ GM inequality on S or on x, y, z.

But AM ≥ GM gives that (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3), so S/3 ≥ (23)^(1/3). Let me compute that.

23^(1/3) is approximately 2.843, so S is at least about 8.529. But that's a lower bound, but we need a more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints.

In that case, we can set up the Lagrangian function as:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, take the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set them to zero, and solve the equations.

Let me compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0

And we have the constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54

xyz = 23

So, the equations we have are:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz = 0

2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz = 0

3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy = 0

4. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54

5. xyz = 23

Now, since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps the minimal configuration is when x = y = z. Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then:

Surface area 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x = 3. So, volume would be 3³ = 27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the minimal sphere would have radius sqrt(3*9)/2 = sqrt(27)/2, which is about 2.598. But since the volume is less, the box can't be a cube. So, the minimal sphere is probably when the box isn't a cube.

Therefore, the minimal configuration isn't when x = y = z. So, perhaps the box is a rectangular prism where two sides are equal, or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's assume that x = y ≠ z.

Let me try that. Let me set x = y, so variables x, x, z.

Then, surface area: 2(x² + xz + xz) = 2x² + 4xz = 54.

Volume: x² z = 23.

So, let's solve for z from the volume equation: z = 23/(x²).

Substitute into surface area equation:

2x² + 4x*(23/(x²)) = 54

Simplify:

2x² + (92)/x = 54

Multiply both sides by x:

2x³ + 92 = 54x

Bring all terms to left:

2x³ -54x +92 =0

Divide both sides by 2:

x³ -27x +46 =0

Hmm, now we have a cubic equation: x³ -27x +46=0.

Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 - 27 +46 = 20 ≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46= 0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor out (x - 2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x -2):
